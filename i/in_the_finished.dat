5|$|Another voice actor {{recruited}} was Mel Blanc, {{best remembered}} for voicing {{many of the}} characters in Warner Bros. cartoon shorts. Blanc was hired to perform the voice of Gideon the Cat. However, it was eventually decided that Gideon would be mute, so all of Blanc's recorded dialogue was subsequently deleted except for a solitary hiccup, which was heard three times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film.|$|E
5|$|Some brewers add {{one or more}} {{clarifying}} {{agents to}} beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of the beer along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> product.

40|$|One {{hundred and}} ninety-five {{crossbred}} steers {{were used to}} compare lifetime implant strategies and {{study the effects of}} implanting during the suckling period on performance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing and <b>finishing</b> periods. There were no differences in growing period gains when both groups were implanted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suckling period and the growing period. However, steers implanted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suckling period but not implanted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing period had significantly lower gains than all other treatments including controls. Steers implanted only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing period had better feed efficiency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing period than both controls and steers implanted only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> suckling period. Steers reimplanted during <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period had similar finishing gains regardless of prior implant treatment, and all implanted cattle gained faster than controls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period. Steers not reimplanted during <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period had lower gains than those reimplanted. Implanting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period resulted <b>in</b> better feed efficiency. All implanted cattle that were reimplanted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period had higher lifetime gains than controls, but {{there was no difference between}} implant combinations. The only carcass characteristic changed by implanting was quality grade, which was reduced by all implant combinations with the exception of implanting only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period. Implanting during the suckling period did not reduce cattle performance during <b>the</b> growing and <b>finishing</b> periods when <b>the</b> steers were also implanted during these periods. This study emphasizes the importance of implanting twice <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> period to maximize finishing gain and final weight...|$|R

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 200 pigs {{were used to}} {{determine}} whether dietary lysine level fed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing phase influenced the response to lysine level fed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase. Pigs were fed either an adequate or low lysine level during the growing (60 to 170 lb) and/ or finishing phase (170 to 265 lb). Feeding a deficient lysine level decreased ADG and F/G during the phase when the deficient diet was fed; however, lysine level fed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> growing phase did not influence <b>the</b> response <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase.

5|$|A {{week before}} the game's release, it became known that an {{agreement}} to include EAX audio technology in Doom 3 reached by id Software and Creative Labs was heavily influenced by a software patent owned by the latter company. The patent dealt with a technique for rendering shadows called Carmack's Reverse, which was developed independently by both John Carmack and programmers at Creative Labs. id Software would have placed themselves under legal liability for using the technique <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> game, so to defuse the issue, id Software agreed to license Creative Labs sound technologies in exchange for indemnification against lawsuits.|$|E
5|$|In the {{commentary}} for the episode, Anderson elaborated on Scully and Waterston's original backstory: after Scully and Waterston {{came close to}} having an affair, Scully left to study at Quantico to become an FBI agent.

The emotional turmoil {{was too much for}} Waterston's wife, who killed herself, which made Waterston's daughter, Maggie, resent Scully, as shown <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> episode. Anderson felt that the removal of this backstory made it hard for the audience to understand why Maggie was so angry at Scully.|$|E

5|$|Petaluma, a {{similarly}} small town approximately 20 {{miles north of}} San Rafael, became more cooperative and American Graffiti moved there without {{the loss of a}} single day of shooting. Lucas convinced the San Rafael City Council to allow two further nights of filming for general cruising shots, which he used to evoke as much of the intended location as possible <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film. Shooting in Petaluma began on June 28 and proceeded at a quick pace. Lucas mimicked the filmmaking style of B movie producer Sam Katzman in attempting to save money and authenticated low-budget filming methods.|$|E
5|$|The Ages of Myst were {{occasionally}} seen as lonely by {{players and}} reviewers. As a result, Cyan added more characters to the sequel, Riven. Villagers scurry {{away as the}} player approaches, and major characters such as Gehn and a rebel band known as the Moiety address the player and give or take items away from him or her. For the first time, Cyan directed the live action actors for Rivens scenes; the designers, including Richard Vander Wende, were apprehensive about how the characters would fit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> product. Rand Miller reprised his role of Atrus due to fan expectation, even though he hated acting.|$|E

5|$|The {{scene of}} Kane {{inspecting}} the egg {{was shot in}} post-production. A fiberglass egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves. The top of the egg was hydraulic, and the innards were a cow's stomach and tripe. Test shots of the eggs were filmed using hen's eggs, and this footage was used in early teaser trailers. For this reason {{the image of a}} hen's egg was used on the poster, and has become emblematic of the franchise as a whole—as opposed to the Alien egg that appears <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film.|$|E

5|$|Writer Troy Kennedy Martin {{was greatly}} {{influenced}} by the political climate of the time, dominated by the Thatcher government, and the aura of secrecy surrounding the nuclear industry – and by {{the implications of the}} Gaia hypothesis of environmentalist James Lovelock; these combined to his crafting a thriller that mingled real world concerns with mythic and mystical elements. Kennedy Martin's original ending was more fantastic than that eventually used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> serial: he had proposed that Craven would turn into a tree but this was vetoed by members of the cast and crew.|$|E

40|$|One hundred-eight gilts with {{an average}} initial wt of 129 lb were {{utilized}} {{to determine the effects}} of porcine somatotropin (pST) and dietary phosphorus on growth performance and bone mineralization and mechanical properties during <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase (129 to 230 lb) and a 35 d post-finishing phase. Gilts were injected daily with placebo (control) or 4 mg pST and fed diets containing. 4,. 8, or 1. 2 % P during <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase. Administration of pST improved F/G 18 %, increased ADG 8 %, and decreased daily feed intake 9 %. There was a quadratic response to P, because gilts receiving the. 8 % P diet were more efficient than gilts fed either. 4 or 1. 2 % P, regardless of whether they received pST or placebo. When pen wt reached 230 lb, half of the gilts were slaughtered and 1 st rib, femur, and 3 rd and 4 th metacarpals were collected. First rib ash content increased linearly as the level of dietary P increased; however, pST administration had no effect on ash content. There was a pST x P interaction for rib bending moment, stress, and modulus of elasticity. Bone strength was maximized for control gilts at. 8 % P, whereas bone strength continued to increase as the level of dietary P was increased for pST-treated gilts. The remaining 54 gilts were individually fed 4 lb/d of a common diet for a 35 d post-finishing phase and then slaughtered. Gilts that received higher P levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase had higher rib ash content at the end of the post-finishing phase. There was a pST x P interaction for treatment combination received <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase on rib and femur bending moment post-finishing. Bone strength for pST-treated gilts receiving the. 8 or 1. 2 % P diet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phased increased to levels exceeding those of control gilts by the end of the post-finishing phase, regardless of dietary P level control gilts were fed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase. These data indicate that gilts administered pST <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase do not have higher Ca and P requirements than non-pST treated gilts to maximize growth performance. However, pST-treated gilts do have higher requirements for Ca and P than non-pST treated gilts to attain comparable bone strength <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase. Gilts receiving pST <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finishing</b> phase demonstrate compensatory mineralization <b>in</b> <b>the</b> post-finishing phase, because bone strength increases to equal or exceed that of control gilts fed similar P levels...|$|R

5|$|Development on Crash: Mind over Mutant began {{immediately}} {{after the completion of}} Crash of the Titans. The idea of preserving a titan for later use came from the play testing sessions of Crash of the Titans, in which the testers were found to be reluctant to leave the titans behind after an epic battle was won. Fans of the series were also a source of inspiration for Crash: Mind over Mutant, having such wishes as a free-roaming environment, Coco Bandicoot being a playable character and the return of the character Doctor Nitrus Brio. Full camera control was considered for the game, but was rejected for graphical reasons and to avoid having to insert a split-screen view in the cooperation mode. Online gameplay was also considered as a feature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> game, but was omitted due to the brief development schedule. Coco Bandicoot as a playable character was omitted from the PlayStation 2 version of the game due to her distinct animations taking up much of the console's memory. The Wii version of Crash: Mind over Mutant was created first, with the graphics scaled up for the Xbox 360, and scaled down for the PlayStation 2. A PlayStation 3 version of the game was rumored, but was promptly debunked by Radical Entertainment as a mistake on many press sites' behalf.|$|E
5|$|In a later {{version of}} the film, Auto comes to the docking bay to {{retrieve}} EVE's plant. The film would have its first cutaway to the captain, but Stanton moved that as he found it too early to begin moving away from WALL-E's point-of-view. As an homage to Get Smart, Auto takes the plant and goes into {{the bowels of the}} ship into a room resembling a brain where he watches videos of Buy n Large's scheme to clean up the Earth falling apart through the years. Stanton removed this to keep some mystery as to why the plant is taken from EVE. The captain appears to be unintelligent, but Stanton wanted him to just be unchallenged; otherwise he would have been unempathetic. One example of how unintelligent the captain was depicted initially is that he was seen to wear his hat upside-down, only to fix it before he challenges Auto. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film, he merely wears it casually atop his head, tightening it when he assumes real command of the Axiom.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preliminary}} study for The World Before the Flood {{now in the}} York Art Gallery, the broad structure {{is similar to that}} of the finished work, but the focus is more strongly on the central group of women.

5|$|Jim Cummings was {{the only}} past TMNT actor to appear in this film, where he had {{previously}} contributed voice-work in the 1987 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series. The film also features three voice actors for Ratchet in the Ratchet & Clank series, Mikey Kelley and Kevin Michael Richardson from the first game, and James Arnold Taylor from the others, playing Michelangelo and Leonardo respectively. TMNT would be Mako Iwamatsu's final acting role. Mako was announced {{as the voice of}} Splinter at the San Diego Comic-Con on July 20, 2006. He then died the next day, aged 72. A dedication to Mako appears {{at the end of the}} film's credits. Although Iwamatsu is the only actor credited in the role, Greg Baldwin performs a substantial portion of Splinter's dialogue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> film; Baldwin had already mimicked Iwamatsu's voice when he took up the late actor's role as Iroh in the concurrently-produced cartoon , and used this precedent to successfully lobby to join the cast of TMNT as Splinter following Iwamatsu's death.|$|E
5|$|Lochner {{seems to}} have {{prepared}} on paper before approaching his underdrawings; {{there is little evidence}} of reworking, even when positioning large groups of figures. Infrared reflectography of the underdrawings for the Last Judgment panels show letters used to denote the final colour to be applied, for example g for gelb (yellow) or w for weiss (white), and there are few deviations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>finished</b> work. He often rearranged drapery fold lines or to denote perspective, enlarged or diminished the size of figures. The underdrawings reveal a draughtsman of skill, dynamism and confidence; the figures appear fully formed with little evidence of reworking. Many are extremely detailed and precisely modelled, for example St Ursula's brooch in the Altarpiece of the City Patron Saints, which contains closely detailed garlands and diadems.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scenes of}} the episode {{contained}} backgrounds that were added with digital effects. One such scene was on Danny's ex-wife's house, which did not have mountains in the background; the mountains were digitally added in post-production. The same technique was used again on the village of quonset huts, and again on the freighter assault scenes, only with {{the background of the}} sea when Hesse and McGarrett fight. After the episode was filmed, the producers discovered that it was too long and spent two weeks deciding what to cut out. One of the scenes involved the team deciding on a name of their task force, but that scene was cut in favor of another episode.
