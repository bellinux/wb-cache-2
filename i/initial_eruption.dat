25|$|The Ochoa Point Member is {{interpreted}} to have accumulated {{as the result}} of continued tidal-flat sedimentation. The lower part of this member appears to have accumulated in the higher mud flat position of the tidal flat environment where periodic desiccation occurred. The upper part of this member is inferred to have accumulated in the deeper, or more seaward part of the tidal-flat environment. At the time that these tidal flats were covered by the <b>initial</b> <b>eruption</b> of the Cardenas Basalt, the eastern grand Canyon region was at or very near sea level. Features found in the lowermost part of the Cardenas Basalt indicate that the basaltic lavas outpoured over unconsolidated sandy and silty Dox sediments at the time they were wet. It is unknown whether these sediments were slightly above or slightly below water level at the time they were buried by lava. The high proportion of altered glass in and the pervasive fracturing (hyaloclastite) of the basal Cardenas Basalt support this interpretation. The high sodium content of the basal Cardenas Basalt indicates spilitization due to reaction with hypersaline water. Hematitic alteration of the sediment that resulted from baking by the lavas is minimal, amounting to a few centimeters or less.|$|E
500|$|A {{considerable}} {{variation in}} height {{has been reported}} for the receptacle, ranging from [...] tall.

The dark olive-green to olive-brown, foul-smelling sticky gleba covers the inner surface of the receptacle, except near the base. The odor—described as resembling rotting meat—attracts flies, other insects, and, in one report, a scarab beetle (Scarabaeus sacer) that help disperse the spores. The putrid odor—and people's reaction to it—have been well documented. In 1862 Mordecai Cubitt Cooke wrote [...] "it is recorded of a botanist who gathered one for the purpose of drying it for his herbarium, that he was compelled by the stench to rise during the night and cast the offender out the window."

500|$|Radiometric dating {{was used}} to {{determine}} the age of rock samples from Lōʻihi. The Hawaii Center for Volcanology tested samples recovered by various expeditions, notably the 1978 expedition, which provided 17 dredge samples. Most of the samples were found to be of recent origin; the oldest dated rock is around 300,000 years old. Following the 1996 event, some young breccia was also collected. Based on the samples, scientists estimate Lōʻihi is about 400,000 years old. The rock accumulates at an average rate of [...] per year near the base, and [...] near the summit. If the data model from other volcanoes such as Kīlauea holds true for Lōʻihi, 40% of the volcano's mass formed within the last 100,000 years. Assuming a linear growth rate, Lōʻihi is 250,000 years old. However, as with all hotspot volcanoes, Lōʻihi's level of activity has increased with time; therefore, it would take at least 400,000 years for such a volcano to reach Lōʻihi's mass.

At Ontake, magma intrusion occurred in late 2006 and early 2007 followed by a phreatic eruption, while in 2014 an accumulation of magmatic gas led to another phreatic eruption.

40|$|Structural mapping, nearest {{neighbour}} and two-point azimuth {{statistical analysis}} of mud volcano vent distributions from nine examples in Azerbaijan and the Lusi mud volcano in east Java are described. Distributions are non-random, forming alignments subparallel to faults within anticlines, ring faults, conjugate faults and detachment faults; this finding confirms a spatial relationship and supports a model for subsurface flow along these features as well as showing fractionation at depth. As fracture and fault orientations are related to structures such as anticlines and the in situ stress state they are therefore predictable. We use vent distributions in Azerbaijan, where the structural geology is well constrained, to propose what controls the distribution of 169 vents at the Lusi mud volcano. This mud volcano system shows evidence for <b>initial</b> <b>eruptions</b> along a NE–SW trend, parallel to the Watukosek fault, changing to eruptions that follow east–west trends, subparallel to regional fold axes. Our analysis indicates that regions east and west of the Lusi mud volcano {{are more likely to}} be affected by new vents than those to the north and south, owing to probable onset of elongate caldera collapse within a 10 km diameter of the central vent.

30|$|Cases of {{decreasing}} eruption rates occur after {{periods of}} intense activity. At Nasu, Azuma, and Adatara, the largest eruptions were either the <b>initial</b> <b>eruptions</b> or those occurring after {{an extended period}} of repose, and subsequent erupted volumes decreased drastically (Figs.  14, 16, 18). In general, eruptions occur when an overpressure in the magma chamber reaches the fracture criterion of the chamber wall (Tait et al. 1989), except for huge magma chamber (Gregg et al. 2013; de Silva and Gregg 2014). After the establishment of a new eruptive conduit, the overpressure necessary for eruption becomes smaller for subsequent eruptions; major decreases in eruption volume are likely related to the lowered failure criterion. Despite repeated subsequent eruptions, the eruption rate decreased gradually in these cases (Figs.  14, 16, 18). Common to all cases of decreasing eruption rate is a well-established magma-plumbing system (stable for 103 – 105 years) that does not show significant compositional variations (Figs.  15, 17, 19). In the case of constant eruption rate volcanoes (Izu-Oshima and Miyakejima), magma compositions differed over 10 – 100  year intervals (Nakano and Yamamoto 1991; Amma-Miyasaka and Nakagawa 2003). We speculate that these high eruption rates are probably maintained by frequent replenishment by variably differentiated magmas from a parental source. Furthermore, magma recharge may also have sustained eruption rates at Nasu, Azuma, and Adatara, although the injection frequency and volume were probably too small to replace the initial magma chamber. As a result, the long-lived magma-plumbing system was preserved without any major changes to the erupted magma compositions.|$|R
40|$|We revisit one of {{the largest}} explosions {{observed}} during the Hinode era, the X 4. 3 class event of 2006 Dec 13. We gain insight into the main eruption through study of two sub-C-class precursor eruptions, occurring within 12 hours of and originating from the same (or nearby) neutral line as the X-flare. The precursors share some features in common with the main eruption, and their lower energy and consequent slower development renders interpretation of these features easier to decipher than in the rapidly explosive main eruption. In addition, because the weak precursors occurred in a magnetically strong region, magnetic connections indicated by soft X-ray loops are readily visible in these cases, while such connections can be much less apparent in weaker-region eruptions. Hinode/SOT magnetograms indicate that photospheric magnetic dynamic activity in the "magnetic core" is the likely ultimate source of the eruptions. All the eruptions, however, produce Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) that have wider spatial extent than the localized source region; this is a long-observed but puzzling phenomena, which can address directly here using the high-quality Hinode data. For the precursor eruptions, Hinode/XRT images show that the <b>initial</b> <b>eruptions</b> occur inside larger-scale magnetic structures that encompass the core. The exploding core field blows out this larger-scale structure, resulting in the CME having angular extent far exceeding that of the source-region core alone; this is the arch-arch-blowout scenario for CMEs of Moore & Sterling (2007). Similar processes occur in the main eruption, except that the much larger energy release in that eruption compared to the precursors results in much faster and larger-scale phenomena...|$|R

50|$|The {{formation}} of Peridot Mesa {{is still being}} studied and debated today, but several theories about the initial formation {{have come to be}} widely accepted among scientists. The <b>initial</b> <b>eruption</b> was an extremely violent, high-energy pyroclastic flow.

Currents that moved toward the North and the South overflowed 1000 m mountain ranges and crossed the Gulf of Naples over the sea, extinguishing all life within a radius of about 100 km. Textural and morphological features of the deposits, and areal distribution suggests that the eruption was of the type of highly expanded low-temperature pyroclastic cloud.|$|E
40|$|Over {{the course}} of its 16  m. y. history, the Yellowstone hotspot has {{produced}} silicic magmas exhibiting systematic, and often sympathetic, variations in isotopic and chemical composition, temperature and frequency of eruption. Nd and Hf isotopic ratios vary systematically from <b>initial</b> <b>eruptions</b> at ∼ 16  Ma, contemporaneous with basaltic volcanism in eastern Oregon and Washington, {{to the present day}} Yellowstone Volcanic Plateau. Nd and Hf isotopic ratios co-vary and span the range of most terrestrial samples, reflecting mixing of mantle and crustal sources. Earliest erupted silicic magmas were hot (in excess of 1050  °C), relatively less evolved and have isotopic ratios within the range of contemporaneous Columbia River flood basalts. The transit of the hotspot across the lithospheric boundary between the western accreted oceanic terrain and the Precambrian craton at 15  Ma is marked by shifts in εNd from + 4 to - 11 and in εHf from + 10 to - 10. The duration of the transit yields a crustal magma source diameter of ∼ 70  km. In the interval from 14 to 9  Ma, εNd systematically increases from - 11 to - 7, recording a minimum increase in the mantle component from 5 % to 30 %. The mantle component could be twice as great, depending upon the isotopic composition of crust and mantle reservoirs. In this same interval, peak temperatures of ∼ 1000  °C occurred at 9  Ma. The last 8  m. y. are characterized by less frequent eruption of lower temperature (830 - 900  °C) and more compositionally evolved magmas. © 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The Gawler Range Volcanics (GRV) of South Australia are an intracontinental, subaerial Large Igneous Province (LIP) formed during supercontinent {{assembly}} in the Mesoproterozoic. Like many LIPs, the GRV are intraplate, were erupted over a geologically short time (~ 2 million years), and {{are dominated by}} voluminous lavas. However, the GRV are overwhelmingly dominated by felsic units. The GRV are essentially undeformed and have not been deeply buried so that their original textures are exceptionally well preserved. Furthermore, they are well exposed in very gently northward and eastward dipping sections up to 4 km thick, allowing assessment of the facies architecture and evolution of this felsic volcanic LIP. The evolution of the GRV can be clearly separated into two main stages. <b>Initial</b> <b>eruptions</b> at numerous volcanic centres produced small to moderate volume, geochemically distinct, felsic lavas and lava domes, together with ignimbrites and minor mafic and intermediate lavas, forming a sequence 0. 5 to 3 km thick. Volcanic activity in this lower sequence varied from effusive to explosive and was not much different in style or products from Phanerozoic felsic volcanic provinces. However, the second stage produced at least three voluminous felsic units, each of which represents about 1000 – 3000 km³ of magma. Moreover, the dominance of evenly porphyritic textures and lack of pyroclastic textures (pumice, shards, broken crystal, lithic clasts) in these units suggests that they were erupted effusively and flowed as lavas. Each of these felsic lavas are generally dominated by a single uniform composition, and commonly mingled with a subordinate and compositionally distinct lava...|$|R
40|$|The {{numerical}} {{studies of}} the interplanetary coupling between multiple magnetic clouds (MCs) are continued by a 2. 5 -dimensional ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model in the heliospheric meridional plane. The interplanetary direct collision (DC) / oblique collision (OC) between both MCs results from their same/different initial propagation orientations. Here the OC is explored {{in contrast to the}} results of the DC (Xiong et al., 2007). Both the slow MC 1 and fast MC 2 are consequently injected from the different heliospheric latitudes to form a compound stream during the interplanetary propagation. The MC 1 and MC 2 undergo contrary deflections during the process of oblique collision. Their deflection angles of |δθ_ 1 | and |δθ_ 2 | continuously increase until both MC-driven shock fronts are merged into a stronger compound one. The |δθ_ 1 |, |δθ_ 2 |, and total deflection angle Δθ (Δθ = |δθ_ 1 | + |δθ_ 2 |) reach their corresponding maxima when the <b>initial</b> <b>eruptions</b> of both MCs are at an appropriate angular difference. Moreover, with the increase of MC 2 's initial speed, the OC becomes more intense, and the enhancement of δθ_ 1 is much more sensitive to δθ_ 2. The |δθ_ 1 | is generally far less than the |δθ_ 2 |, and the unusual case of |δθ_ 1 |≃|δθ_ 2 | only occurs for an extremely violent OC. But because of the elasticity of the MC body to buffer the collision, this deflection would gradually approach an asymptotic degree. Therefore, the deflection due to the OC should be considered for the evolution and ensuing geoeffectiveness of interplanetary interaction among successive coronal mass ejections (CMEs).

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} model for the growth of a maar-{{diatreme}} complex in a shallow marine environment. The Miocene-age Costa Giardini diatreme near Sortino, in the region of the Iblei Mountains of southern Sicily, has an outer tuff ring formed by the accumulation of debris flows and surge deposits during hydromagmatic eruptions. Vesicular lava clasts, accretionary lapilli and bombs in the older ejecta indicate that <b>initial</b> <b>eruptions</b> were of gas-rich magma. Abundant xenoliths in the upper, late-deposited beds of the ring suggest rapid magma ascent, and deepening of the eruptive vent is shown by the change in slope of the country rock. The interior of the diatreme contains nonbedded breccia composed of both volcanic and country rock clasts of variable size and amount. The occurrence of bedded hyaloclastite breccia in an isolated outcrop in the middle-lower part of the diatreme suggests subaqueous effusion at a low rate following the end of explosive activity. Intrusions of nonvesicular magma, forming plugs and dikes, occur on the western side of the diatreme, and at the margins, close to the contact between breccia deposits and country rock; they indicate involvement of volatile-poor magma, possibly during late stages of activity. We propose that initial hydromagmatic explosive activity occurred in a shallow marine environment and the ejecta created a rampart that isolated for a short time the inner crater from the surrounding marine environment. This allowed explosive activity to draw down the water table {{in the vicinity of the}} vent and caused deepening of the explosive center. A subsequent decrease in the effusion rate and cessation of explosive eruptions allowed the crater to refill with water, at which time the hyaloclastite was deposited. Emplacement of dikes and plugs occurred nonexplosively while the breccia sediment was mostly still soft and unconsolidated, locally forming peperites. The sheltered, low-energy lagoon filled with marine limestones mixed with volcaniclastic material eroded from the surrounding ramparts. Ultimately, lagoonal sediments accumulated in the crater until subsidence or erosion of the tuff ring caused a return to normal shallow marine conditions...|$|R
