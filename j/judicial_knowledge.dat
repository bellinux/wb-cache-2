40|$|In {{the legal}} domain, ontologies enjoy quite some {{reputation}} {{as a way to}} model normative knowledge about laws and jurisprudence. Several methods have been used and are well-known qua ontological methods. However, no previous attempt to construct ontologies based on professional knowledge exists, capturing judicial practical expertise. This paper shows the preliminary ontology development for the second version of the prototype Iuriservice, a web based intelligent FAQ for judicial use, containing a repository of professional <b>judicial</b> <b>knowledge.</b> The iFAQ system will focus on such knowledge and will base on OPLK —Ontology of Professional Legal Knowledge — developed by UAB. Profesional Legal Knowledge refers to the core of professional work that contains the experience of the daily treatment of cases and is unevenly distributed within individuals {{as a result of their}} professional and personal experiences. The knowledge acquisition process has been based on an ethnographic process designed by the UAB team and the Spanish School of the Judiciary within the national SEC project, to efficiently obtain useful and representative information from questionnaire-based interviews. Nearly 800 competency questions have been extracted from these interviews and the ontology is being modelled from the selection of relevant terms. Regarding ontology modelling issues, we have followed the DILIGENT argumentation methodology to control the discussion and trace the arguments used in favor or against the introduction of a concept X as part of the domain ontology. This paper presents the preliminary Ontology of Professional <b>Judicial</b> <b>Knowledge</b> (OPJK) that has been extracted manually from the selection of relevant terms from nearly 200 competency questions and affirms that the modelling of this professional <b>judicial</b> <b>knowledge</b> demands the description of this knowledge as it is perceived by the judge and the abandonment of dogmatic legal categorizations. 1...|$|E

40|$|Introduction Recent {{years have}} seen intense media scrutiny, concerted policy {{discussion}} and significant law reform {{on the relationship between}} the consumption of alcohol (and other drugs) and the commission of criminal offences. Much of the debate has been dominated by the view that, particularly for crimes of violence, the state of ‘intoxication’ produced by the consumption of alcohol and other drugs (‘AOD’) should be regarded as an aggravating factor that adds to the seriousness of the harm done and warrants additional punishment. Some recent legislative reform measures have unambiguously embraced this position. As important as it is, treating intoxication as an aggravating factor is, in fact, only one {{of the ways in which}} Australian criminal law attaches significance to AOD consumption. We are currently undertaking a large-scale study of the ‘knowledges’ and assumptions about the relationship between intoxication and violence (and other offending and anti-social behaviours) that are reflected in Australian criminal laws. Our project compares legislative and <b>judicial</b> <b>knowledges</b> on ‘intoxication’ with scientific and social scientific expert knowledges on the effects of AOD, and the relationship between AOD consumption and violence and other criminal offending. It maps and assesses the multiple ways in which Australian criminal laws attach significance to the attribute of intoxication, and investigates the effects these approaches may have in practice. We aim to facilitate enhanced clarity, consistency and integrity in laws that attach penal significance to the fact of a person’s intoxication, and improve the criminal law’s capacity to meet the needs of the community with respect to the attribution of criminal responsibility for AOD-related anti-social behaviour, harms and risks. In this article, we report on the first phase of the study: the collection, mapping and analysis of federal, state and territory legislative provisions that attach significance to intoxication in a ‘criminal law’ context – whether to justify the exercise of a police power, as a substantive element of an offence, or as an aggravating factor relevant to an element of an offence or sentencing. In addition to cataloguing the different purposes for which significance is attached to intoxication and the sorts of settings and activities in relation to which such laws are operative, we also highlight the claims about AOD consumption and effects, and the moral judgments about AOD use that underpin legislation, and examine how ‘intoxication’ is defined for various criminal law purposes...|$|R

It is here that the judiciary may constrain state control on migration to service ‘higher aspirations, namely, the recognition of human rights and fundamental freedoms of all persons’ (Opeskin, 2012, p. 553). Slaughter (2004) identified the capacity of judiciaries to rise to the challenge of prioritising the enforcement of human rights in domestic courts {{as a result of a}} global <b>judicial</b> dialogue. <b>Knowledge</b> transfer among the transgovernmental judicial body is of fundamental value to furthering such an objective (Marmo, 2005; Marmo, 2012).

40|$|According to {{the legal}} norms in China, judges {{are not allowed to}} deviate from the {{sentencing}} model of deductive legal reasoning and syllogism, and thus, they cannot make law. The inherent limitations of this model figure in the reasoning of judges, such as the poor interpretation of the abstract terms of laws and regulations, the difficulties of identifying legally relevant facts and the simplicity of the reasoning process, which lacks legal rationality. While they are subject to the conditions of the legal system, some external and internal factors influence the judges’ reasoning behind their decisions concerning the determination of sentences. The internal factors include the <b>knowledge,</b> <b>judicial</b> experience, special experiences, and attitude of the judge; the external factors refer to the circumstances of the victim, the personality of the offender, the intervention of external power, and the opinion of the public. All of these factors are parts of the dilemma of sentencing justly. Only if the formal and substantive levels of justice are compatible with each other can the justice of sentencing be realized. Finally, this paper would like to put forward some suggestions to deal with the dilemma of sentencing justly, such as improving the quality of sentencing system, standardizing the judges’ sentencing skills, improving the criteria of the judges’ appointment, and constructing an effective communication channel between the judges and society...|$|R
40|$|The {{question}} of the thesis is ‘How to enhance {{the effectiveness of the}} Vietnamese judiciary in dealing with intellectual property rights cases toward the compliance with requirements of the TRIPs Agreement?’. The critical themes in this thesis are how a developing country at the low level of development {{as in the case of}} Vietnam, with various distinctiveness in term of economy, society, culture, politics, or legality can enhance its judicial effectiveness in dealing with IP cases in order to fulfil its international obligations under TRIPs Agreement. Despite the importance of the issue, there has not been any research on the first integration of Vietnamese judiciary in line with international regulations on IPRs protection and enforcement applicable to all WTO member states. This thesis will also examine impacts of this international compliance for the Vietnamese judiciary in particular, and to this South East Asian country in general. After analysing the critical situation of IPRs infringements in Vietnam, which lie behind an impetus for change, the thesis will review the historical development of IPRs and main provisions of the TRIPs Agreement. Next, the thesis will examine the definition of judicial effectiveness in special reference to minimum standards as provided in the TRIPs Agreement. I will argue that judicial effectiveness in enforcing IPRs can not be improved to comply with the TRIPs Agreement unless judiciary’s capacity in preventing and deterring IP infringements, <b>judicial</b> organisation and <b>knowledge,</b> and other factors involving legal procedures are enhanced. In the light of above analysis, I will analyse the judicial organisation and legal knowledge in dealing with IP cases, and the adequacy of legislation concerning judicial measures for IPRs enforcement.

40|$|At {{the time}} this book was published, reports of the Casey Anthony trial filled the news media, demonstrating that popular fascination with {{infanticide}} continues to the present day. Like Casey Anthony, Grethe Schmidt maintained her innocence despite being judged guilty by the public. The tremendous differences between the medical <b>knowledge,</b> <b>judicial</b> systems, and cultural values of seventeenthcentury Germany and twenty-first-century America mean {{that there are more}} differences than similarities between the two cases. In telling the story of an obscure German girl who was arrested for murdering her newborn baby in summer 1661, Myers raises broader questions of how societies define, convict of, and punish criminal behavior. Death of a Maiden is divided into two unequal parts. The first, longer part focuses on Grethe herself, a fifteen-year-old peasant girl who worked as a domestic servant in the city of Braunschweig. Myers uses the first few chapters to set the stage for Grethe’s story by describing the setting, both geographically and socially, of the alleged crime and by explaining the state’s concern with infanticide cases as a way of regulating female sexuality. He also discusses the assumptions that underlay the inquisitorial procedure followed by the authorities who investigated the case, most notably the presumption of guilt and the need to produce a confession that would establish the truth of the charges made against the accused. Myers then describes the series of interrogations ofGrethe’s employers, neighbors, and family members as the authorities tried to determine when the alleged crime occurred. This was a difficult task, because {{there was no evidence that}} Grethe had ever given birth to a child, let alone killed it. The immediacy of the story is heightened by translations from the interrogation records, many of them so cryptic that Myers needs to explain both their context and their content. Grethe admitted to having had sex once (and possibly not voluntarily) with the stepson of her employer, and others reported their suspicions that she had been pregnant, but she steadfastly denied having carried a baby to full term, nor could anyone attest to having seen a child. The failure to determine that an act of infanticide had occurred led the authorities to apply torture to Grethe. This resulted in an initial confession that contradicted most of the evidence provided by interrogation of witnesses. Only after a second round of torture did Grethe give a new confession that was vague enough to accord with the earlier testimonies and so to satisfy the authorities...|$|R
40|$|Adult female {{targets of}} {{domestic}} violence by male perpetrators have commonly been described as helpless and passive. This {{is consistent with the}} criminal justice system's perception that true “victims” have little culpability or agency in a violent assault. Otherwise, the “victims” {{are more likely to be}} defined as participants in the violent act, and thus unworthy of official protection. This study examines court opinions involving convictions of male offenders {{of domestic violence}} against their female partners and ex-partners. The purpose is to understand the development of <b>judicial</b> <b>knowledge</b> as to whether women in relationships with violent men are socially constructed as worthy and legitimate victims of violence. The 60 + appellate case opinions in the analysis are those where a California trial court accepted expert testimony on domestic violence in prosecuting the male offenders to explain the women's actions regarding their violent relationships. California was chosen because of the state's progressive and unique evidentiary statutes that permit a broad range of evidence in criminal prosecutions of domestic violence, including expert witnesses. In reviewing the judicial opinions that comprise the corpus, I found that an underlying assumption evident in the judicial discourses is that abused women would, should or could easily exercise agency in ending an abusive relationship and, once it was ended, refuse to reengage in their abusive relationships. Using critical discourse analysis, this study shows that, in constructing women's agency in resisting abusive relationships, judicial discourse tended to rely more heavily upon expert testimony and, in a few cases, on prosecutorial arguments, than on the testimony (i. e. voice) of the female victims themselves. In this process, the women's voices were silenced or marginalized as experts’ constructions of victimized women were preferred...|$|E

40|$|Case flow {{management}} (CFM) is recognised as {{an essential}} component {{for the success of}} the overall management in contemporary courts. Case flow management programmes are adopted and implemented in many courts and tribunals across many nations to improve the courts� supervision of time and events from the beginning of cases to their finalisation. The case tracking system (CTS) is the most common tool in an automated case flow management system, providing crucial information to trace and track cases. The Administrative Court of Thailand and the Office of the Administrative Courts employ two such systems to promote overall court management. They are keen to improve and adjust the case tracking system, which is the main tool the Administrative Court 2 ̆ 7 s judges and executive judges employ in supervising case progress and enhancing the courts� overall capacity. The central aim of this thesis is to make a contribution to the improvement of the case flow and case tracking systems of the Administrative Court. With this goal in sight, the thesis examines various aspects of the two systems in three stages. The first stage is the investigation of general principles, objectives and practices from United States of America perspective and a comparison of general principles, objectives and practices between those of the Federal Court of Australia (representing common law and adversarial systems) and the Thai Administrative Court (representing civil law and inquisitorial systems). The comparative study between the two courts includes the historical background of the establishment of these courts and their case flow management and case tracking systems. The implementation of the case flow management and case tacking systems of the Administrative Court is analysed from the perspectives of three groups of users: judges, case officials and parties to cases. Interviews were conducted with selected judges and high-ranking court officials on various aspects of court policy and practice. Methodologically, I view the interviews are used as a primary source of data. The opinions of non-executive judges and case officials on various issues of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s case flow and case management systems were sought by questionnaire. The questionnaires were also distributed to parties who have experienced the Court 2 ̆ 7 s case management in order to gain the perspectives of an external group. Consequently, the actual implementation of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s policies in the two systems and the perceptions of the efficiency and achievements of such systems are explored in a practical way. A review of the literature was conducted and interviews undertaken with selected experts in court and case management in the Federal Court. The aim of these theoretical and comparative stages was to provide a thorough understanding of the Administrative Court and its case flow management and case tracking systems. Finally, the thesis attempts to identify the shortcomings of the case flow management and case tracking systems which emerge from the results of the two earlier stages of this study. Recommendations are then made to improve the functioning of the two systems in various areas. It is suggested that the effectiveness of the CFM can be developed in specific ways in the following areas: (i) timestandards for case flow management; (ii) timestandards for case finalisation: (iii) standards for monthly judicial output; (iv) investigation of the scope of the use of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) by judges and case officials and the establishment of a 2 ̆ 7 Settlement Division 2 ̆ 7 for dealing with the suitable administrative cases; (v) adoption and adjustment of differentiated case management (DCM) techniques; and (vi) 2 ̆ 7 Administrative Case System Programme (ACSP) Improvement Plan 2 ̆ 7. Suggested core measures to achieve the overall objectives of the implementation of the case flow management systems are to: (i) provide education to the public and encourage and increase parties 2 ̆ 7 accountability, (ii) implement and enforce the suggested timestandards for case flow management and the suggested timestandards on case finalisation, (iii) enhance <b>judicial</b> <b>knowledge</b> by a 2 ̆ 7 peer group educating system 2 ̆ 7, (iv) refine the case allocation system by employing an adjusted DCM technique and a nominating system, (v) standardise the judges 2 ̆ 7 managerial role by enforcing suggested timestandards and by forming a research group to develop models for judge 2 ̆ 7 s writing styles for judgements, orders and statements, (vi) develop and execute a formal and practical plan for the improvement of the case tracking system (as suggested in the 2 ̆ 7 ACSP Improvement Plan 2 ̆ 7 and other IT systems, (vii) revise and lay down the functioning of the 2 ̆ 7 Censor Division 2 ̆ 7, (viii) enhance the knowledge of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s IT officers, and (ix) provide continuity and high standard for case officials 2 ̆ 7 seminars and training programmes.
