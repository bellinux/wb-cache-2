They relate to equity between social groups, broadening participation, equity with part-time students in higher education and in further education, strengthening the student role in higher education, and identifying a new source of income that can be ring-fenced for higher education.|$|E

2500|$|According to Evelyn Underhill, {{illumination}} [...] is {{a generic}} English {{term for the}} phenomenon of mysticism. The term illumination {{is derived from the}} Latin , applied to Christian prayer in the 15th century. Comparable Asian terms are bodhi, kensho and satori in Buddhism, commonly translated as [...] "enlightenment", and vipassana, which all point to cognitive processes of intuition and comprehension. According to Wright, the use of the western word enlightenment is based on the supposed resemblance of bodhi with Aufklärung, the independent use of reason to gain insight into the true nature of our world. As a matter of fact there are more resemblances with Romanticism than with the Enlightenment: the emphasis on <b>feeling,</b> <b>on</b> intuitive insight, on a true essence beyond the world of appearances.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 May 1917 the President of the Board of Deputies David Lindo Alexander QC co-signed a {{statement}} in the Times attacking Zionism and asserting that the Jewish Community in Britain was opposed to it.

When it was passed, he resigned. Although subsequent analysis {{has shown that the}} success of the motion possibly {{had more to do with}} a <b>feeling</b> <b>on</b> the part of Deputies that Lindo Alexander had failed to consult them than with a massive conversion on their part to the Zionist cause, nevertheless it had great significance outside the community.
