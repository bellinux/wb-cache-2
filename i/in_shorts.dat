5|$|After {{returning}} to Canada, Peart was recruited to play drums for a St. Catharines band known as Hush, who {{played on the}} South Ontario bar circuit. Soon after, a mutual acquaintance convinced Peart to audition for the Toronto-based band Rush, which needed a replacement for its original drummer John Rutsey. Geddy Lee and Alex Lifeson oversaw the audition. His future bandmates describe his arrival that day as somewhat humorous, as he arrived <b>in</b> <b>shorts,</b> driving a battered old Ford Pinto with his drums stored in trashcans. Peart felt the entire audition was a complete disaster. While Lee and Peart hit it off {{on a personal level}} (both sharing similar tastes in books and music), Lifeson had a less favourable impression of Peart. After some discussion, Lee and Lifeson accepted Peart's maniacal British style of drumming, reminiscent of The Who's Keith Moon.|$|E

25|$|In 1953, Marian Jordan's {{periodic}} {{health problems}} necessitated the shortening of Fibber McGee and Molly into a nightly fifteen-minute program, recorded without a studio audience in single sessions, {{the better to}} enable Jordan to rest. This timing was sadly appropriate, as classic radio had entered its dying days.

25|$|If one invests $100 in {{an inverse}} ETF {{position}} in an asset worth $100, and the asset's value changes to $80 {{and then to}} $60, then {{the value of the}} inverse ETF position will increase by 20% (because the asset decreased by 20% from 100 to 80) and then increase by 25% (because the asset decreased by 25% from 80 to 60). So the ETF's value will be $100*1.20*1.25=$150. The gain of an equivalent short position will however be $100–$60=$40, and so we see that the capital gain of the ETF outweighs the volatility loss relative to the short position. However, if the market swings back to $100 again, then the net profit of the short position is zero. However, since the value of the asset increased by 67% (from $60 to $100), the inverse ETF must lose 67%, meaning it will lose $100. Thus the investment <b>in</b> <b>shorts</b> went from $100 to $140 and back to $100. The investment in the inverse ETF, however, went from $100 to $150 to $50.|$|E

500|$|With the {{widespread}} arrival of sound film in American theaters in 1929, many independent exhibitors began dropping the then-dominant presentation model, which involved live acts {{and a broad}} variety of shorts before a single featured film. A new programming scheme developed that would soon become standard practice: a newsreel, a short and/or serial, and a cartoon, followed by a double feature. The second feature, which actually screened before the main event, cost the exhibitor less per minute than the equivalent running time <b>in</b> <b>shorts.</b> The majors' [...] "clearance" [...] rules favoring their affiliated theaters prevented the independents' timely access to top-quality films; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead. The additional movie also gave the program [...] "balance"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. The low-budget picture of the 1920s thus evolved into the second feature, the B movie, of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E

500|$|The video {{features}} appearances by Beyoncé's sister Solange Knowles, {{her background}} dancers, including French dancing duo Les Twins, and her all-female band.

The singer is then seen performing a dance with several background dancers as they hold rollers in their hands and enter a place called [...] "Roller City USA".

Several scenes which are shot in bright black light follow as Beyoncé performs another dance sequence along with her dancers on their rollers. The second, more uptempo part of the song starts and the singer is seen arriving with a vehicle in front of a place called [...] "Cherry".

[...] She said that the visual is about life in which differences are celebrated and appreciated easily and with happiness and claimed that was the reason Martin [...] "just wanted it to be natural" [...] and to differ from what he had done before with choreography, big sets and directed scenes. Martin also commented the shooting process, [...] "It's an incredible feeling to have had the opportunity to participate in a global initiative like SuperSong. I'm very excited to finally be able to sing 'Vida' and share this special song with the world." [...] On April 21, Martin released a teaser from the video on his official social networks, while the full video premiered on his Vevo channel on YouTube the next day.

2500|$|In 2006 Panahi made Offside. In the film, a {{group of}} young Iranian girls {{disguise}} themselves as boys to sneak into Azadi Stadium to watch the World Cup qualifying football playoff game between Iran and Bahrain. The film was partially shot during the actual game it depicts. Since the 1979 Islamic Revolution women have been banned from attending football matches in Iran on grounds of rowdy and aggressive language, lewd behavior, and seeing men <b>in</b> <b>shorts</b> and short sleeve shirts. At one point Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had wanted to repeal the law but was overruled by the ulema. Panahi has stated [...] "I use the football game as a metaphor to show the discrimination against women on a larger scale. All my movies have that topic at their center. This is what I am trying to change in Iranian society." [...] The film was inspired by an incident several years earlier when Panahi's daughter was refused entry to a football stadium but ended up sneaking into the stadium anyway.|$|E

In the 12-minute comedy, directed by My Week with Marilyn assistant director Chris Foggin on a budget of just £5,000, she portrays a pensioner grappling with a crush on her church choirmaster and the art of cyber-flirting via social networking. Dench made her seventh and final appearance as M in the twenty-third James Bond film, Skyfall (2012), directed by Sam Mendes. In the film, Bond investigates an attack on MI6; it transpires that it is part of an attack on M by former MI6 operative, Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem) to humiliate, discredit and kill M as revenge against her for betraying him. Dench's position as M was subsequently filled by Ralph Fiennes' character. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the James Bond series, Skyfall was positively received by critics and at the box office, grossing over $1billion worldwide, and became the highest-grossing film of all-time in the UK and the highest-grossing film in the James Bond series. Critics called Dench's Saturn Awards-nominated performance [...] "compellingly luminous".|$|E

As described by historian Thomas Schatz, the system [...] "sent a picture, after playing in the lucrative first-run arena, through the 16,000 'subsequent-run' movie houses; 'clearance' refers to the amount of time between runs, and 'zone' refers to the specific areas in which a film played. Typically, a top feature would play in its second run in smaller downtown theaters [...] and then move steadily outward from the urban centers to the suburbs, then to smaller cities and towns, and finally to rural communities, playing in ever smaller (and less profitable) venues and taking upwards of six months to complete its run." [...] The [...] "clearance" [...] policy prevented independent exhibitors' timely access to top-quality films as a matter of course; the second feature allowed them to promote quantity instead. The bottom-billed movie also gave the program [...] "balance"—the practice of pairing different sorts of features suggested to potential customers that they could count on something of interest no matter what specifically was on the bill. As the president of one Poverty Row company would later put it, [...] "Not everybody likes to eat cake. Some people like bread, and even a certain number of people like stale bread rather than fresh bread." [...] The low-budget picture of the 1920s naturally transformed into the second feature, the B movie, of the 1930s and 1940s—the most reliable bread of Hollywood's Golden Age.|$|E
