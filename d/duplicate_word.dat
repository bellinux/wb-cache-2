In this paper, we propose a system that uses word patch descriptors for retrieving images containing visual text. A random sampling method is used to find <b>duplicate</b> <b>word</b> patches in the database and reduce the database size. The system achieves comparable retrieval performance to state-of-the-art image feature-based systems for images of book covers, and performs better than state-of-the-art text-based retrieval systems for images of book pages. Using visual text to provide distinctive features, our system achieves more than 10 -to- 1 query size reduction for images of book covers and more than 16 -to- 1 query size reduction for images of book pages. ...|$|E
40|$|Alan Hedge, Jeffrey HancockFrequent brief rest breaks, {{known as}} micro-breaks, {{have been shown}} to benefit {{computer}} users by reducing fatigue and possibly preventing musculoskeletal disorders. Various methods of reminding users to take rest breaks have been developed. Initially, efforts focused on the use of break reminder computer software, although potentially this may be disruptive to work patterns. More recently, micro-break reminders have been incorporated into computer equipment and these have been indexed to work activity, and this approach may offer less potential for disrupting work activities. 	A computer mouse has been developed that vibrates in the user's hand after 10 seconds of inactivity. The vibration is intended to remind the user to rest his or her hand in a neutral position while not actively engaging the mouse rather than maintaining a grip on the mouse that requires static muscle contraction. A laboratory experiment was conducted to test this vibrating mouse against a conventional mouse to see how it affected subjects' task performance, task behaviors, and mouse preference. It was hypothesized that the vibrating mouse would increase the number of times subjects removed their hands from the mouse, be minimally disruptive and have no adverse effect on task performance. The study also explored what subjects did with their hand when this was removed from the mouse. 	Eleven female and seven male subjects participated in the experiment. Use of the vibrating mouse (experimental condition) was compared to use of a conventional mouse (control condition) for five consecutive tasks. The first three tasks required the finding and correcting of duplicate words, the finding and correcting of duplicate sentences and the finding and correcting of misspelled words from text passages. The final two tasks were a reading comprehension task, where the subjects answered four multiple-choice questions about a text passage, and a composition task in response to a business scenario. 	Subjects were videotaped to collect data on their behavior while completing the tasks under both conditions. Task time and number of errors were collected as performance measures. User preferences and musculoskeletal discomfort were gathered using two questionnaires, one administered pre test and one post test. 	No differences were found in performance between the two conditions. The vibrating mouse induced more positive task behaviors than the conventional mouse, including significantly more resting behavior (p= 0. 02) and slightly more hand removals (p= 0. 06). The vibrating mouse, however, also induced significantly more negative task behaviors than the conventional mouse, such as increasing the frequency of unsupported hand hovering (p= 0. 00). Nine subjects found that the vibrating mouse was disruptive to their performance during the <b>duplicate</b> <b>word</b> and reading tasks; and eight found that the vibrating mouse was disruptive during the <b>duplicate</b> <b>word</b> task. The effectiveness of the mouse seemed to correspond to task type and also to subjects' mouse use technique. 	Because of technological limitations and a desire to limit extraneous distractions to the subjects during the tasks, the vibration occurrence data was collected by subjects' self reporting the number of vibration occurrences they experienced. This subjectiveness may have compromised the reliability of the vibration frequency data. 	The vibrating mouse shows promise but {{more research is needed to}} understand the conditions under which a vibration occurs and therefore when a user would gain benefits from this mouse. The effects of task type and user technique need to be examined in more detail to determine the nature of these effects before recommendations can be made as to the proper implementation of the vibrating mouse.

50|$|The list is {{actually}} {{composed of two}} lists, each containing 256 phonetically distinct words, in which each word represents a different byte value between 0 and 255. Two lists are used because reading aloud long random sequences of human words usually risks three kinds of errors: 1) transposition of two consecutive <b>words,</b> 2) <b>duplicate</b> <b>words,</b> or 3) omitted words. To detect all three kinds of errors, the two lists are used alternately for the even-offset bytes and the odd-offset bytes in the byte sequence. Each byte value {{is actually}} represented by two different words, depending on whether that byte appears at an even or an odd offset {{from the beginning of}} the byte sequence. The two lists are readily distinguished by the number of syllables; the even list has words of two syllables, the odd list has three. The two lists have a maximum word length of 9 and 11 letters, respectively. Using a two-list scheme was suggested by Zhahai Stewart.|$|R

Automatic classification was based on the similarity between a target word and individual categories of words in the thesaurus, measured by the cosine function. Experiments were done on 120 target words from four regions. The automatic classification results were evaluated against a gold standard obtained from human judgements. In general accuracy reached 80 % or more with the top 10 (out of 80 +) and top 100 (out of 1, 300 +) candidates considered at the subclass level and semantic head level respectively, provided that the appropriate data sources were used...|$|R

A bigram can be treated as a single word to increase the speed and relevance of results returned by a search engine that is based on inverted index. Terms in a user query have a different degree of importance based on whether they occur inside title, description or anchor text of the document. Therefore an optimal weighting scheme for these components is required for search engines to prioritize relevant documents near the top for user searches. The goal of my project is to improve Yioop, an open source search engine created by Dr Chris Pollett, to support search for duplicate terms and bigrams in a search query.

Within the scope of the study, in different weeks the students were presented with the topic titles of " 1 - Narrate a day where your dreams come true; 2 - Describe a match of a different branch of sports you have watched; 3 - Write an essay concerning your opinions on brand enthusiasm; 4 - Imagine that you are an entity other than human and write down your feelings " and were asked to write essays on these. In order to be able to obtain data from the essays written by the students, the essays were transferred into computerized environment, and the word lists of each topic title were created via the software Simple Concordance 4. 07.

50|$|Some flaws {{with the}} bilingual dual coding theory have been identified. One of {{which deals with}} the {{constant}} finding that translated items are better recollected than the words that are directly recalled or require deriving synonyms for. This was originally thought because translated words are better remembered because they engage both memory systems, compared to synonyms which {{require the use of}} only one memory system. With this in mind, it was also thought that between language systems have stronger associations, compared to within language systems. This means that there are well developed associations for the translated words because there are stronger associations between two languages, compared to the connections within only one language, as seen with synonyms. Other explanations have also been explored to explain this phenomenon, one is that the translated words are better remembered because they are more deeply processed than words that people are simply asked to recall or create synonyms for. This is in line with the levels of processing effect, where in relation to the bilingual dual coding theory, words that participants are required to think of synonyms for are better recalled than the words they were simply asked to copy. This is because creating synonyms requires deeper processing than just <b>duplicating</b> a <b>word.</b> Similarly, words that participants are required to translate will be better remembered than the words they created synonyms for.|$|R

40|$|The EPA radon {{measurement}} device protocols recommend duplicate measurements for 10 % of devices deployed or {{a maximum of}} 50 per month. In addition, {{one of the three}} options for real estate testing calls for simultaneous, side-by-side measurements. While these side-by-side measurements are not identified as such, they are actually duplicate tests. Since most testers will choose the side-by-side option (rather than sequential or continuous testing) and since most testing is currently done for real estate transactions, we can expect a large increase in the overall number of duplicate tests conducted in the future. Some radon testers have applauded this approach as a big improvement in the confidence of real estate testing results. We contend that this is not necessarily true. Unfortunately, when duplicate measurements yield similar values, this shows that the devices are able to provide reproducible results, but it does not say that either measurement is accurate with respect to the true radon level.

In turn, countries within the European Union (EU) are implementing media access services {{for people with}} disabilities at different rates, speeds and styles. What may start in one country as a media access anecdote or sporadic event may develop into a service that aims to improve media accessibility for all. Media accessibility tends to begin as an isolated event, {{as in the case of}} the Cooperativa Sociale Scurelle (Scurelle Cooperative Association), the Cinema senza Barriere (Cinema without Barriers) or the Museo del Cinema in Torino (Turin Cinema Museum) events in Italy, but once the trend is underway, and the audience is aware of its availability, the next step would be to establish a standard quality service. This is the objective of this article. The first part aims to provide an overview of Media Access in Europe, paying special attention to Italy, where media access for the disabled is not widely available. While even a minimum cultural content could have maximum diffusion, the opposite is the case in Italy. Very few movies are accessible and sometimes, are <b>duplicated.</b> In other <b>words,</b> we found different audio descriptions of the same film. Media access duplication is a widespread trans-European phenomenon. The second part of the article examines the different approaches to audio description of the same film in Italy.
