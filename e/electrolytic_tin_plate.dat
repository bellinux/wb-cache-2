The facility produced electrolytic and hot-dipped tinplate, black plate, and terneplate. It also had a metal decorating plant for coating and lithographing tin, terne, and black plate, and two <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> lines that produced tin plate at up to 1,000 feet per minute.|$|E
40|$|Plant trial {{evaluations}} {{have been}} completed for two zirconium-based, non-chromium passivation systems previously identified as possible alternatives to cathodic dichromate (CDC) passivation for electrolytic tinplate (ETP). These trials were done on a commercial <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> <b>plating</b> line at Weirton Steel and extensive evaluations of the materials resulting from these trials {{have been completed}}. All this was accomplished as a collaborative effort under the AISI Technology Roadmap Program and was executed by seven North American Tin Mill Products producers [Bethlehem Steel (now acquired by International Steel Group (ISG)), Dofasco Inc., National Steel (now acquired by U. S. Steel), U. S. Steel, USS-Posco, Weirton Steel, and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel] with funding partially from the Department of Energy (DOE) and partially on an equal cost sharing basis among project participants. The initial phases of this project involved optimization of application procedures for the non-chromium systems in the laboratories at Bethlehem Steel and Betz Dearborn followed by extensive testing with various lacquer formulations and food simulants in the laboratories at Valspar and PPG. Work was also completed at Dofasco and Weirton Steel to develop methods to prevent precipitation of insoluble solids {{as a function of}} time from the zirconate system. The results of this testing indicated that sulfide staining characteristics for the non-chromium passivation systems could be minimized but not totally eliminated and neither system was found to perform quite as good, in this respect, as the standard CDC system. As for the stability of zirconate treatment, a method was developed to stabilize this system for a sufficient period of time to conduct plant trial evaluations but, working with a major supplier of zirconium orthosulfate, a method for long term stabilization is still under development...|$|R

5000|$|In 1905, Weir and Phillips {{took out}} loans of $10,000 and $15,000 (respectively) and {{organized}} the Phillips Sheet and <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Company. They purchased the failing Jackson Sheet and <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Company in Clarksburg, West Virginia, for $190,000. Phillips {{died in a}} train crash {{a few months after}} the company was formed, and Weir took as a new partner John C. Williams, a Welsh immigrant who was in charge of all <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> operations at the plant. They rapidly expanded the eight-mill facility, adding four more mills in 1908. A second plant with 10 mills was opened in Holliday's Cove, West Virginia, in 1909, and expanded by another 10 mills in 1910. That same year, Weir began building a company town next to Holliday's Cove, naming it Weirton. In 1912, Weir purchased the Pope Sheet and <b>Tin</b> <b>Plate</b> Company in Steubenville, Ohio. By 1913, his company was the second largest manufacturer of <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> in the United States (behind US Steel). [...] Weir focused on vertical integration, purchasing coal mines, coking plants, furnaces, iron mines, ships, and tin mines.

40|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>plate</b> {{products}} {{are widely used}} in the packaging industry. The quality of the surface tin coating is paramount as it protects the material from corrosion. Grain boundary precipitates may form {{on the surface of}} low carbon steels during annealing prior to <b>tin</b> <b>plating.</b> These precipitates affect the quality of the tin coating when they are greater than 250 nm in diameter as they act to de-wett the coating disrupting the tin coating process not only leaving the coating uneven which appears as a region of low reflectivity in affected areas but can also reduce the corrosion resistance of the <b>tin</b> <b>plate</b> product in the affected areas...|$|R
40|$|Surface oxides {{formed at}} ferrite grain {{boundaries}} of low carbon steels annealed at 700 °C in 5 % hydrogen 95 % nitrogen atmosphere were characterized using {{scanning electron microscopy}} (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Two different oxides (Fe,Mn) O and MnCr 2 O 4 are observed at the grain boundaries and the former is five-fold coarser than the latter. It was found at the annealing temperature of 700 °C that the mean particle size of the (Fe,Mn) O depends on the manganese content, and the mean particle size and distribution of the MnCr 2 O 4 dependent on chromium, but independent of manganese. It is unlikely the coarse (Fe,Mn) O precipitates pose any potential risks to the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> coating quality as they will be removed by the pickling operation prior to tinning. The potential risks posed by the MnCr 2 O 4 {{to the quality of}} the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tin</b> coating of tinplate products can be minimized by restricting the chromium content of the steel...|$|R
