25|$|Bill Krohn {{has noted}} that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene {{introduced}} all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene – most notably, {{the fact that the}} attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the <b>drain</b> <b>hole</b> of the bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for Vertigo. Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene.|$|E
500|$|A blocked {{pitot tube}} is a pitot-static problem {{that will only}} affect {{airspeed}} indicators. [...] A blocked pitot tube will cause the airspeed indicator to register an increase in airspeed when the aircraft climbs, even though actual airspeed is constant.(As long as the <b>drain</b> <b>hole</b> is also blocked, as the air pressure would otherwise leak out to the atmosphere) [...] This {{is caused by the}} pressure in the pitot system remaining constant when the atmospheric pressure (and static pressure) are decreasing. [...] In reverse, the airspeed indicator will show a decrease in airspeed when the aircraft descends. [...] The pitot tube is susceptible to becoming clogged by ice, water, insects or some other obstruction. [...] For this reason, aviation regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) recommend that the pitot tube be checked for obstructions prior to any flight. [...] To prevent icing, many pitot tubes are equipped with a heating element. [...] A heated pitot tube is required in all aircraft certificated for instrument flight except aircraft certificated as Experimental Amateur-Built.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{optimization}} of {{the location}} and height of weir & dam with <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> in a single-strand continuous casting tundish was carried out from the view of fluid flow characteristics by physical modeling using a 0. 4 scaled water model and mathematical modeling study.

30|$|The {{operatively}} placed {{gauze dressing}} was removed and replaced on postoperative day 2. The dressing was inspected and reapplied every 24  h thereafter until the surgical wound was completely dry. In addition, the suction canister drains were removed when the 24 -h output {{was less than}} 50  cc of fluid. A separate occlusive dressing {{was placed on the}} suction canister <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> and changed daily until completely dry. Wounds or <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> producing persistent copious drainage, defined as saturation of a dressing every 8  h, had a vacuum-assisted closure (KCI, San Antonio, TX, USA) device placed on either the incision or <b>drain</b> <b>holes.</b> The vacuum dressing was removed after 48  h and the wound reassessed. All wounds were assessed for infection. We defined infection as persistent purulent drainage, surrounding erythema, and positive intraoperative wound cultures. Patients were not discharged from the hospital until the incision and <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> were completely dry. At 2  weeks, patients returned to the clinic for staple removal or wound inspection. In addition, patients were evaluated in the clinic at 6  weeks, 3  months, 6  months, and 1  year. All patients were followed clinically for 1  year.|$|R
5000|$|Geologically, much of {{the area}} {{surrounding}} the lake is lava bed created {{during a period of}} volcanic activity around 1000 BCE in the Cascade Range of Oregon.Water levels on the lake change significantly over the seasons; in spring, autumn, and winter the lake is a popular fishing location, but during the summer the lake drains completely through lava tube <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> {{in the bottom of the}} lake. Open lava tubes are scattered around the region, and the nearby Fish Lake (...) is another lake with underwater <b>drain</b> <b>holes.</b> Over the years, locals have attempted to fill in the <b>drain</b> <b>holes</b> with debris, and used heavy machinery to carve holes elsewhere in the lakebed to keep some water from draining out. A research project in 2003 inferred that the water goes through the lava tubes into Clear Lake 9.5 km southwest.|$|R

50|$|A {{limber hole}} is a <b>drain</b> <b>hole</b> through a frame or other {{structural}} {{member of a}} boat designed to prevent water from accumulating against {{one side of the}} frame, and allowing it to drain toward the bilge. Limber holes are common in the bilges of wooden boats. The term may be extended to cover drain holes in floors. Limber holes are created in between bulkheads so that one compartment does not fill with water. The limber holes allow water to drain into the lowest part of the bilge {{so that it can be}} pumped out by a single bilge pump (or more usually, one electric and one manual pump).|$|E
50|$|Several {{types of}} recirculators are {{currently}} on the market.

50|$|Construction of {{the tunnel}} began in 1903 and was {{completed}} in 1909. It was built to use the plentiful supplies of the River Derwent as compensation water for the River Rivelin rather than draining the more valuable waters of Redmires Reservoirs. The tunnel is 4.5 mi long, 6 ft high and 6 ft wide, it has a fall towards Rivelin of 1 in 3,600 which is 6 ft 7in (2.0m) over its entire length. The tunnel takes water which has come through a <b>drain</b> <b>hole</b> in the south east corner of Ladybower Reservoir and delivers it into the Lower Rivelin Reservoir with the tunnel emerging into a grass covered underground tank on the south bank at a point next to where the Wyming Brook enters the Lower reservoir.
