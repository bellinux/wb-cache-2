25|$|A <b>depository</b> <b>institution</b> can satisfy its reserve {{requirements}} by holding either vault cash or reserve deposits.

25|$|Another {{instrument}} of monetary policy adjustment {{employed by the}} Federal Reserve System is the fractional reserve requirement, {{also known as the}} required reserve ratio.

The required reserve ratio is set by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The reserve requirements have changed over time and some history of these changes is published by the Federal Reserve.|$|E

2500|$|The rule distinguishes {{transactions}} by banking entities from transactions by nonbank financial companies {{supervised by}} the Federal Reserve Board. [...] The rule states that in general, [...] "an insured <b>depository</b> <b>institution</b> may not purchase an asset from, or sell an asset to, an executive officer, director, or principal shareholder of the insured <b>depository</b> <b>institution,</b> or any related interest of such person ... unless— the transaction is on market terms; {{and if the}} transaction represents more than 10 percent of the capital stock and surplus of the insured <b>depository</b> <b>institution,</b> the transaction has been approved in advance {{by a majority of}} the members of the board of directors of the insured <b>depository</b> <b>institution</b> who do not have an interest in the transaction." [...] Providing for the regulation of capital, the Volcker Rule says that regulators are required to impose upon institutions capital requirements that are [...] "countercyclical, so that the amount of capital required to be maintained by a company increases in times of economic expansion and decreases in times of economic contraction", to ensure the safety and soundness of the organization. The rule also provides that an insured state bank may engage in a derivative transaction only if the law with respect to lending limits of the state in which the insured state bank is chartered takes into consideration credit exposure to derivative transactions. The title provides for a three-year moratorium on approval of FDIC deposit insurance received after November 23, 2009, for an industrial bank, a credit card bank, or a trust bank that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by a commercial firm.|$|E
2500|$|Title VI, or the [...] "Bank and Savings Association Holding Company and <b>Depository</b> <b>Institution</b> Regulatory Improvements Act of 2010", {{introduces}} the so-called [...] "Volcker Rule" [...] after former Chairman of the Federal Reserve Paul Volcker by amending the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. With {{the aim of}} {{reducing the amount of}} speculative investments on large firms' balance sheets, it limits banking entities to owning no more in a hedge fund or private equity fund than 3% of the total ownership interest. The total of all of the banking entity's interests in hedge funds or private equity funds cannot exceed 3% of the Tier 1 capital of the banking entity. Furthermore, no bank that has a direct or indirect relationship with a hedge fund or private equity fund, [...] "may enter into a transaction with the fund, or with any other hedge fund or private equity fund that is controlled by such fund" [...] without disclosing {{the full extent of the}} relationship to the regulating entity, and assuring that there is no conflict of interest. [...] "Banking entity" [...] includes an insured <b>depository</b> <b>institution,</b> any company controlling an insured <b>depository</b> <b>institution</b> and such a company's affiliates and subsidiaries, and must comply with the Act within two years of its passing, although it may apply for time extensions. In response to the Volcker Rule and in anticipation of its ultimate impact, a number of commercial banks and investment banks operating as bank holding companies have already begun to downsize or dispose of their proprietary trading desks.|$|E

2500|$|To {{assist the}} FDIC in resolving an {{insolvent}} bank, the FDIC requires plans including the required submission of a resolution plan by covered institutions requirement under the Dodd Frank Act. In {{addition to the}} Bank Holding Company ("BHC") resolution plans required under the Dodd Frank Act under Section 165(d), the FDIC requires a separate Covered Insured <b>Depository</b> <b>Institution</b> ("CIDI") resolution plan for US insured depositories with assets of $50 billion or more. Most of the largest, most complex BHCs are subject to both rules, requiring them to file a 165(d) resolution plan for the BHC that includes the BHC's core businesses and its most significant subsidiaries (i.e., [...] "material entities"), {{as well as one}} or more CIDI plans depending on the number of US bank subsidiaries of the BHC that meet the $50 billion asset threshold.|$|E
