2500|$|An {{independent}} study in 2014 used portable emissions measurement systems to measure [...] emissions during real world driving from fifteen <b>Euro</b> <b>6</b> compliant diesel passenger cars. The {{results showed that}} [...] emissions were on average as much as seven {{times higher than the}} <b>Euro</b> <b>6</b> limit. However, some of the vehicles did show reduced emissions, suggesting that real world [...] emission control is possible. In one particular instance, research in diesel car emissions by two German technology institutes found that zero 'real' [...] reductions in public health risk had been achieved despite 13 years of stricter standards (2006 report).|$|E
2500|$|Emission {{standards}} for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are summarised {{in the following}} tables. Since the Euro 2 stage, EU regulations introduce different emission limits for diesel and petrol vehicles. Diesels have more stringent CO standards but are allowed higher [...] emissions. Petrol-powered vehicles are exempted from particulate matter (PM) standards through to the Euro 4 stage, but vehicles with direct injection engines are subject to a limit of 0.005g/km for Euro 5 and <b>Euro</b> <b>6.</b> A particulate number standard (P) or (PN) has been introduced in 2011 with Euro 5b for diesel engines and in 2014 with <b>Euro</b> <b>6</b> for petrol engines.|$|E

2500|$|In 2017, the European Union will {{introduce}} testing in real-world conditions called Real Driving Emissions, using portable emissions measurement systems {{in addition to}} laboratory tests.
