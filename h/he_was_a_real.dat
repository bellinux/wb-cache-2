5|$|Frank Grimes' {{favorite}} television series, Dishonorable Discharge, ends {{after six}} seasons {{and it is}} revealed that the entire series was just an angel's dream. Grimes is outraged and determined to change the ending. Later, Mark Lilly tells his girlfriend, the half-demon Callie Maggotbone, {{that he has not}} seen his father since his sixth birthday. Mark's roommate, the zombie Randall, is touched by this and decides to document Mark's journey to find his father, so that he can become a Hollywood director. Mark is assigned by Twayne Boneraper to investigate Grimes, who has been busting people who enjoyed the ending of Dishonorable Discharge. He and Randall (who documents everything with his video camera) ride along with Grimes. In a memory sequence of Grimes', it is revealed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> cop in the 1970s and worked with an undercover expert named Jimmy. He was dishonorably discharged from the force and repressed all of his memories of being a cop. Mark figures that this is why he is so angry with the ending of the series, and takes him through his past by using the same car Grimes and his partner Jimmy had. In the car, Grimes has a memory sequence again and drives to Hollywood.|$|E

When Ickis, Oblina and Krumm saw him they thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> monster betraying them.

25|$|His rotator-cuff injury {{diagnosed}} in March 1997 kept {{him away from}} cricket till November 1997. Until that time, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> express bowler. This injury was very serious (caused due to overload of bowling) and Srinath at that time had 92 Test wickets from 27 Tests- only 46 in his first 18 Tests, but 46 in his last 9 games. It was wondered if Srinath would {{ever be able to}} bowl again, let alone be ranked among the fastest bowlers in the world. After he announced his retirement in Nov 2003, Srinath revealed that he feared his career was over when he was trying to recover from the rotator-cuff injury. (See para 14 of this article).|$|E
25|$|In 1972, {{science fiction}} author Philip José Farmer wrote Tarzan Alive, a {{biography}} of Tarzan utilizing the frame device that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> person. In Farmer's fictional universe, Tarzan, along with Doc Savage and Sherlock Holmes, are the cornerstones of the Wold Newton family. Farmer wrote two novels, Hadon of Ancient Opar and Flight to Opar, set {{in the distant past}} and giving the antecedents of the lost city of Opar, which {{plays an important role in}} the Tarzan books. In addition, Farmer's A Feast Unknown, and its two sequels Lord of the Trees and The Mad Goblin, are pastiches of the Tarzan and Doc Savage stories, with the premise that they tell the story of the real characters the fictional characters are based upon. A Feast Unknown is somewhat infamous among Tarzan and Doc Savage fans for its graphic violence and sexual content.|$|E
500|$|The historiography {{is often}} {{positive}} toward Caxias and several historians have ranked {{him as the}} greatest Brazilian military officer. To historian Nelson Werneck Sodré, he was [...] "not only the greatest military commander of his continent , in his time, but [...] a great politician". Moreover, Caxias was [...] "—more than D. PedroII—the Empire." [...] Francisco Doratioto said that the duke [...] "in Paraguay had doubts, pride, resentment, and made mistakes; in short, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> character ... Caxias, however, was able to rise above his limitations, imposed on himself great personal sacrifices and incorporated the responsibility of accomplishing the objective... In this context, Caxias was, indeed, a hero; he carried with him, it is true, social and political prejudices of his time, but one can not demand from the past the observance of present-day values." ...|$|E

500|$|In August 1975, Rhodes spotted nineteen-year-old Kings Road habitué John Lydon {{wearing a}} Pink Floyd T-shirt {{with the words}} I Hate {{handwritten}} above the band's name and holes scratched through the eyes. Reports vary at this point: the same day, or soon after, either Rhodes or McLaren asked Lydon {{to come to a}} nearby pub in the evening to meet Jones and Cook. According to Jones, [...] "He came in with green hair. I thought he had a really interesting face. I liked his look. He had his 'I Hate Pink Floyd' T-shirt on, and it was held together with safety pins. John had something special, but when he started talking <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> arsehole—but smart." [...] When the pub closed, the group moved on to SEX, where Lydon, who had given little thought to singing, was convinced to improvise along to Alice Cooper's [...] "I'm Eighteen" [...] on the shop jukebox. Though the performance drove the band members to laughter, McLaren convinced them to start rehearsing with Lydon. Lydon later described the social context in which the band came together: ...|$|E

2500|$|Hunt {{was known}} as a fast driver with an aggressive, tail-happy driving style, but one prone to {{spectacular}} accidents, hence his nickname of Hunt the Shunt. In reality, while Hunt was not necessarily any more accident prone than his rivals in the lower formulae, the rhyme stuck and stayed with him. In the book, James Hunt: The Biography, John Hogan said of Hunt: [...] "James was the only driver I've ever seen who had the vaguest idea about what it actually takes to be a racing driver." [...] Niki Lauda stated that [...] "We were big rivals, especially {{at the end of the}} [...] season, but I respected him because you could drive next to him—2 centimetres, wheel-by-wheel, for 300 kilometres or more—and nothing would happen. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> top driver at the time." ...|$|E

2500|$|While at Mascot, Canutt met John Wayne while {{doubling}} {{for him in}} {{a motorcycle}} stunt for The Shadow of the Eagle in 1932. Wayne admired Canutt’s agility and fearlessness, and Canutt respected Wayne’s willingness to learn and attempt his own stunts. [...] Canutt taught Wayne how to fall off a horse."The two worked {{together to create a}} technique that made on-screen fight scenes more realistic. Wayne and Canutt found if they stood at a certain angle in front of the camera, they could throw a punch at an actor’s face and make it look as if actual contact had been made." [...] Canutt and Wayne pioneered stunt and screen fighting techniques still in use. Much of Wayne's on-screen persona was copied from Canutt. The characterizations associated with Wayne - the drawling, hesitant speech and the hip-rolling walk - were pure Canutt. Said Wayne, [...] "I spent weeks studying the way Yakima Canutt walked and talked. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> cowhand." ...|$|E

He was just so outstandingly good and getting better, and although I was getting better too, the space between us remained huge. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> musician, he knew and felt music, a bass player, with a lovely sense of harmony, as well as a great guitarist. I knew tunes and how to play them but that was where my musicianship ended. Unfortunately, I’m still the same to this day. I work very hard, I play every day but I’m still ordinary. I can be flashy, but it’s all tricks really. He’s a musician and I’m just not in the same league. So, I gave up these ambitions and concentrated on what I was really born to do." [...] After Harvey left the group, Connolly and Rafferty continued as a duo and the latter two of their three albums featured just that duo. [...] Connolly sang, played five-string banjo, guitar, and autoharp, and at live shows entertained the audience with his humorous introductions to the songs.|$|E
