50|$|At {{the time}} of the Partition of India, the then-Mehtar of Chitral, Muzaffar ul-Mulk chose to accede to Pakistan. The state of Chitral <b>executed</b> <b>an</b> <b>Instruments</b> of Accession on 6 October 1947, which was contentedly {{accepted}} by the Government of Pakistan. In 1954 <b>a</b> Supplementary <b>Instrument</b> of Accession was signed and the Chitral Interim Constitution Act was passed whereby the State of Chitral become a federated state of Pakistan. The same year, a powerful advisory council was established on the insistence of the Federal Government of Pakistan. This body continued to govern Chitral until 1969. The Frontier States of Dir, Chitral and Swat were finally merged through the promulgation of the Dir, Chitral and Swat Administration Regulation of 1969 under General Yahya Khan. The complete takeover of the administration by the Government of Pakistan meant that effectively the states had been extinguished.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{possible}} {{cause of the}} crash discussed by the NTSB in its review of the CVR was that the crew was apparently trying to visually locate the Charlotte airport, while <b>executing</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> approach {{in the presence of}} low-lying fog. In addition, a persistent attempt to visually identify the nearby Carowinds amusement park tower, known as [...] "Carowinds Tower" [...] to pilots, rising to an elevation of 1314 ft, or 340 ft above ground level (AGL), may have further distracted and confused the flight crew. The first officer (co-pilot) was operating the flight controls, and none of the required altitude callouts were made by the captain, which compounded the flight crew's near total lack of altitude awareness.|$|E
50|$|A {{medallion}} {{signature guarantee}} is a binding warranty, issued by {{an agent of}} the authorized guarantor institution, that: (a) the signature was genuine; (b) the signer was an appropriate person to endorse, and (c) the signer had legal capacity to sign. A medallion signature guarantee is not equivalent to an American Notarial act. One American Notarial act, called an acknowledgment, is a formal declaration made before an authorized public officer (i.e. Notary Public, Judge or Justice). It is made by a person <b>executing</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> who states it was his “free act and deed”. The three essential components of an acknowledgment are: (a) the personal appearance before an authorized public officer; (b) positive identification; (c) the actual acknowledgment of signing. Unlike medallion signature guarantees, the person executing many legal documents does not have to sign his name in the physical presence of the issuing officer (i.e. Notary Public, Judge or Justice).|$|E
50|$|However, the {{emergence}} of The Earl of Home as the new Leader of the Conservative Party and his appointment as Prime Minister on 19 October led to a sudden requirement to find him {{a seat in the}} House of Commons. Douglas-Home's Scottish ancestry made him look with particular interest at Kinross and West Perthshire; speculation earlier in the week had already linked him with it. On Sunday 20 October, Younger announced his offer to withdraw in favour of Home, an offer which was graciously accepted. Younger was later selected for Ayr, which he represented from 1964 to 1992. On 23 October, Home <b>executed</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> of disclaimer under the Peerage Act 1963, becoming Sir Alec Douglas-Home. The new session of Parliament was delayed to await the outcome of the by-election.|$|R
50|$|IAP charts are {{aeronautical}} charts that {{portray the}} aeronautical data {{that is required}} to <b>execute</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> approach to <b>an</b> airport. Besides depicting topographic features, hazards and obstructions, they depict the procedures and airport diagram. Each procedure chart uses {{a specific type of}} electronic navigation system such as an NDB, TACAN, VOR, ILS/MLS and RNAV. The chart name reflects the primary navigational aid (NAVAID), if {{there is more than one}} straight-in procedure or if it is just a circling-only procedure. A communication strip on the chart lists frequencies in the order they are used. Minimum, maximum and mandatory altitudes are depicted in addition to the minimum safe altitude (MSA) for emergencies. A cross depicts the final approach fix (FAF) altitude on NPAs while a lightning bolt does the same for PAs. NPAs depict the MDA while a PA shows both the decision altitude (DA) and decision height (DH). Finally, the chart depicts the missed approach procedures in plan and profile view, besides listing the steps in sequence.|$|R
500|$|The LFR {{navigation}} system required, at a minimum, only a simple AM radio receiver {{on board the}} aircraft to accurately navigate the airways under instrument meteorological conditions, and even <b>execute</b> <b>an</b> <b>instrument</b> approach to low minimums. On the downside, however, it had only four course directions per station, was sensitive to atmospheric {{and other types of}} interference and aberrations, and required pilots to listen for hours to an annoying monotonous beep, or a faint stream of Morse codes, often embedded in background [...] "static". Its eventual replacement, the VHF band VOR {{navigation system}}, had many advantages. The VOR was virtually immune to interference, had 360 available course directions, had a visual [...] "on course" [...] display (with no listening needed), and was far easier to use. Consequently, when the VOR system became available in the early 1950s its acceptance was rapid, and within a decade the LFR was mostly phased out. VOR itself is gradually being phased out today in favor of the far superior Global Positioning System (GPS).|$|R

2500|$|On {{the evening}} of December 23, 1985 a Beechcraft Baron N1494G, <b>executing</b> <b>a</b> missed <b>instrument</b> {{approach}} procedure from an approach to runway 19R, lost control and crashed into {{the roof of the}} Macy's Department Store at nearby Sunvalley Mall, killing the pilot and two passengers and seriously injuring 84 Christmas shoppers in the crowded mall, mainly by spraying them with burning fuel. [...] Four of the victims on the ground later died. [...] The accident brought increased opposition to the airport and caused Pacific Southwest Airlines to delay scheduled passenger flights that had been planned to start in January 1986.|$|R
50|$|The {{approach}} minimums for LNAV {{approaches are}} {{higher than that of}} ILS approaches, and RNAV approaches that incorporate vertical guidance. Aircraft <b>executing</b> <b>an</b> LNAV <b>instrument</b> approach must descend incrementally rather than follow a fixed glide slope. This is called a 'non-precision' approach to distinguish it from a precision approach in which there is electronic vertical (slope) guidance down to a decision altitude (DA). In the case of the non-precision approach, the aircraft can descend only to what is referred to as a minimum descent altitude (MDA). An MDA segment is flown until the airport is in sight and the pilot can land. If the airport is not in sight by the time the pilot reaches a missed approach point (MAP) on the MDA, the aircraft must <b>execute</b> <b>a</b> missed approach.|$|R
40|$|A {{simulator}} {{study was}} conducted to measure the effectiveness of predictor information incorporated into a CRT display of a computer simulated aircraft's horizontal and vertical situation. Professional pilots served as subjects for the task of <b>executing</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>instrument</b> procedure turn at constant altitude in constant crosswinds with and without their predicted ground track displayed. The results show that the display with the predicted ground track was markedly and significantly superior to the display without this information and that the subjects were generally satisfied with this type of information. Mean rms lateral path error was independent of the crosswind velocity with the predictor information, and increased without it with increasing wind velocity. Rms stick activity decreased with the predictor display which also uncoupled aileron and elevator activity...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{describes}} Pica, a fine-grain, message-passing architecture {{designed to}} efficiently support high-throughput, low-memory parallel applications, such as image processing, object recognition, and data compression. By specializing the processor and reducing local memory (4, 096 36 -bit words), multiple nodes {{can be implemented}} on a single chip. This allows highperformance systems for high-throughput applications to be realized at lower cost. The architecture minimizes overhead for basic parallel operations. An operand-addressed context cache and round-robin task manager support fast task swapping. Fixed-sized activation contexts simplify storage management. Word-tag synchronization bits provide low-cost synchronization. Several applications {{have been developed for}} this architecture, including thermal relaxation, matrix multiplication, JPEG image compression, and Positron Emission Tomography image reconstruction. These applications have been <b>executed</b> using <b>an</b> <b>instrumented</b> instruction-level simulator. The results of these experiments and an evaluation of Pica’s architectural features are presented. Index Terms—Fine-grain parallelism, image processing architectures, through-wafer interconnects, MIMD architectures. ...|$|R

40|$|Perfect pre-deployment test {{coverage}} is notoriously {{difficult to achieve}} for large applications. Given enough end users, however, many more test cases will be encountered during an application’s deployment than during testing. The use of runtime verification after deployment would enable developers to detect unexpected situations. Unfortunately, the prohibitive performance cost of runtime monitors prevents their use in deployed code. In this work, we study the feasibility of collaborative runtime verification, a verification approach which can distribute the burden of runtime verification among multiple users and over multiple runs. Each user <b>executes</b> <b>a</b> partially <b>instrumented</b> program and therefore suffers {{only a fraction of}} the instrumentation overhead. We focus on runtime verification using tracematches. Tracematches are a specification formalism that allows users to specify runtime verification properties via regular expressions with free variables over the dynamic execution trace. We propose two techniques for soundly partitioning the instrumentation required for tracematches: spatial partitioning, where different copies of a program monitor different program points for violations, and temporal partitioning, where monitoring is switched on and off over time. We evaluate the relative impact of partitioning on a user’s runtime overhead by applying each partitioning technique to a collection of benchmarks that would otherwise incur significant instrumentation overhead. Our results show that spatial partitioning almost completely eliminates runtime overhead (for any particular benchmark copy) on many of our test cases, and that temporal partitioning scales well and provides runtim...|$|R
