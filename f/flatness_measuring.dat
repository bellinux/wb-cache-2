Using this technique, {{the temperature of the}} satellite antenna was heated from the room temperature to 70 °C, and the temperature distribution of the antenna was well-proportioned and stable. Based on the photogrammetry, a <b>flatness</b> <b>measuring</b> method of satellite antennas under thermal loads was proposed. The full-field displacement of the antenna was approved. This paper provided a new technology for the <b>flatness</b> <b>measuring</b> of satellite antennas under thermal loads, and applied it on a satellite antenna sub array.

40|$|Spectral <b>Flatness</b> <b>Measure</b> is a {{well-known}} method for quantifying the amount of randomness (or “stochasticity”) that is present in a signal. This measure has been widely used in signal compression, audio characterization and retrieval. In this paper we present an information-theoretic generalization of this measure that is formulated {{in terms of a}} rate of growth of multi-information of a non-Gaussian linear process. Two new measures are defined and methods for their estimation are presented: 1) considering a source-filter model, a Generalized Spectral <b>Flatness</b> <b>Measure</b> is developed that estimates the excessive structure due to non-Gaussianity of the innovation process, and 2) using a geometrical embedding, a block-wise information redundancy is formulated using signal representation in an Independent Components basis.

To process each audio frame, the system selects either WP or DCT as the transform {{based on the}} frame <b>flatness</b> <b>measures</b> in the wavelet domain and the frequency domain. If DCT is chosen, all DCT coefficients are quantized by a non-uniform quantizer according to the frequency masking curve. On the other hand, frame data are segmented into 26 fixed subbands when WP is chosen. Then, the system selectively utilizes DCT to promote frequency resolution of each subband based on the subband <b>flatness</b> <b>measure.</b> By quoting optimal bit-allocation for non-ideal filter bank, the masking threshold from psychoacoustic model can be translated into specific criteria in the wavelet domain for quantization.

An extension of a computerprogram applied to the evaluation of flatness measurement (as described in the CIRP-Annals, vol. 26 (1977), no. 1), separates the form deviations of a surface into a geometrical part and a random part. The geometric part consists of a best-fitting non-flat, reference plane, composed of the single curvature of a sphere and the double curvature of a real twisted plane. Three parameters (the dimensionless curvature parameters of sphericity and torsion, together with the direction of the torsionvector) are able to characterize the geometrical part of the surface; a fourth one is a measure for the random part. Advantages of the method are demonstrated {{with the aid of a}} long-term investigation into the form stability of a granite surface plate. Another extension of the program makes it now possible to measure surfaces with non-rectangular contours in the same way as it is being done in case of a rectangular surface plate. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{cold rolling}} of thin metal strip, contact {{conditions}} between the work rolls and the strip are of great importance: roll deformations and {{their effect on}} strip thickness variation may lead to strip flatness defects and thickness inhomogeneity. To control the process, online process measurements are usually carried out; such as the rolling load, forward slip and strip tensions at each stand. Shape defects of the strip are usually evaluated after the last stand of a rolling mill thanks to a <b>flatness</b> <b>measuring</b> roll. However, none of these measurements is made within the roll bite itself due to the harsh conditions taking place in that area. This paper presents a sensor capable of monitoring strip thickness variations as well as roll bite length in situ and in real time. The sensor emits ultrasonic pulses that reflect from the interface between the roll and the strip. Both the time-of-flight of the pulses and the reflection coefficient (the ratio of the amplitude of the reflected signal {{to that of the}} incident signal) are recorded. The sensor system was incorporated into a work roll and tested on a pilot rolling mill. Measurements were taken as steel strips were rolled under several lubrication conditions. Strip thickness variation and roll-bite length obtained from the experimental data agree well with numerical results computed with a cold rolling model in the mixed lubrication regime.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of natural branching systems generally reflects functional optimization. A common property {{is that their}} bifurcations are planar and that daughter segments do not turn back {{in the direction of}} the parent segment. The present study investigates whether this also applies to bifurcations in 3 D dendritic arborizations. This question was earlier addressed in a first study of flatness of 3 D dendritic bifurcations by Uylings and Smit (1975), who used the apex angle of the right circular cone as <b>flatness</b> <b>measure.</b> The present study was inspired by recent renewed interest in this measure. Because we encountered ourselves shortcomings of this cone angle measure, the search for an optimal <b>measure</b> for <b>flatness</b> of 3 D bifurcation was the second aim of our study. Therefore, a number of measures has been developed in order to quantify flatness and orientation properties of spatial bifurcations. All these measures have been expressed mathematically in terms of the three bifurcation angles between the three pairs of segments in the bifurcation. The <b>flatness</b> <b>measures</b> have been applied and evaluated to bifurcations in rat cortical pyramidal cell basal and apical dendritic trees, and to random spatial bifurcations. Dendritic and random bifurcations show significant different <b>flatness</b> <b>measure</b> distributions, supporting the conclusion that dendritic bifurcations are significantly more flat than random bifurcations. Basal dendritic bifurcations also show the property that their parent segments are generally aligned oppositely to the bisector of the angle between their daughter segments, resulting in “symmetrical” configurations. Such geometries may arise when during neuronal development the segments at a newly formed bifurcation are subjected to elastic tensions, which force the bifurcation into an equilibrium planar shape. Apical bifurcations, however, have parent segments oppositely aligned with one of the daughter segments. These geometries arise in the case of side branching from an existing apical main stem. The aligned “apical” parent and “apical” daughter segment form together with the side branch daughter segment already geometrically a flat configuration. These properties are clearly reflected in the <b>flatness</b> <b>measure</b> distributions. Comparison of the different <b>flatness</b> <b>measures</b> made clear that they all capture flatness properties in a different way. Selection of the most appropriate measure thus depends on the question of research. For our purpose of quantifying flatness and orientation of the segments, the dihedral angle β was found to be the most discriminative and applicable single measure. Alternatively, the parent elevation and azimuth angle formed an orthogonal pair of measures most clearly demonstrating the dendritic bifurcation “symmetry” properties...|$|R

40|$|An often {{encountered}} {{problem when}} implementing a mass flow regulator in a rolling mill {{is the one}} with measurement of speed. The most widely used solution is to fit a pulse counter to a wheel that is {{in contact with the}} strip. Common problems with this design are for instance scratch marks on the strip and problems with the <b>flatness</b> <b>measuring</b> system.   One way of circumventing the aforementioned problems would be a non-contact measuring system. The market of today only offers systems based on the Doppler principle. This report evaluates three different systems for non-contact speed measurement. Important areas in the evaluation have been the ability to operate under normal rolling conditions, integration in existing control system and how well the sensor can be fitted to the rolling mill. The potential gains and possibilities for improvements have also been evaluated.   To be able to calculate the possible earning potential of the implementation of a mass flow regulator it’s very important to know how much scrap the rolling mill in question generates. The approximation showed that the average loss is 250 kg per coil which equals 2, 5 % of the weight of a full size coil. It’s possible to improve this number with a perfectly tuned mass flow regulator.

40|$|Background—Early {{defibrillation}} {{is considered}} {{the most important factor}} for restoring spontaneous circulation in cardiac arrest patients with ventricular fibrillation. Recent studies have shown that, after prolonged ventricular fibrillation, the rates of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival are improved if defibrillation is delayed so that CPR can be given first. To examine whether CPR improves myocardial readiness for defibrillation, we analyzed whether CPR causes changes in predictors of defibrillation success calculated from the ventricular fibrillation waveform. Methods and Results—ECG recordings were retrieved for 105 patients from an original study of 200 patients receiving CPR or defibrillation first. Altogether, 267 CPR sequences from 77 patients were identified on which the effect of CPR could be evaluated. Five predictors of ROSC (spectral <b>flatness</b> <b>measure,</b> energy, centroid frequency, amplitude spectrum relationship, and estimated probability of ROSC) were determined from a spectral analysis of the ventricular fibrillation waveform immediately before and immediately after each of the 267 sequences. CPR increased spectral <b>flatness</b> <b>measure,</b> centroid frequency, and amplitude spectrum relationship (P 0. 05, P 0. 001, P 0. 01). In an analysis of the effect of the duration of CPR, the probability of ROSC and amplitude spectrum relationship showed a positive change for CPR sequences lasting 3 minutes (P 0. 001, P 0. 05). Conclusions—During resuscitation from ventricular fibrillation, changes in the predictors calculated from the ventricular fibrillation waveform indicated a positive effect of CPR on the myocardium.

30|$|Spectral <b>flatness</b> is a <b>measure</b> of the width, uniformity, and noisiness of {{the power}} spectrum. A high {{spectral}} flatness indicates that the spectrum has a similar amount of power in all spectral bands, and the graph of the spectrum would appear relatively flat and smooth; this would sound similar to white noise. A low spectral flatness indicates that the spectral power is less uniform in frequency structure, and this would typically sound like speech. Therefore, the analysis over a long window for exploiting the spectral flatness of the signal will be beneficial for distinguishing speech from noise. In this paper, we propose a novel VAD algorithm based on long-term spectral <b>flatness</b> <b>measure</b> (LSFM). The discriminative power of the proposed LSFM feature will be verified by researching the distribution of LSFM measure for speech and non-speech {{in terms of their}} misclassification rate for various noises.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of bifurcations in natural branching systems often reflects optimization constraints during formation, leading to, for instance, a planar {{arrangement of the}} branches (segments). The present study aimed at testing whether bifurcations in 3 D neuronal branching patterns also follow this general property. A <b>measure</b> for the <b>flatness</b> of bifurcations is the apex angle of the right circular cone enwrapping the bifurcation (cone angle) and earlier applied to dendritic bifurcations [1]. Recently, the cone angle was used by Kim et al. [2] {{in an analysis of}} bifurcations in Purkinje cells and retinal ganglion cells. As the cone angle distributions in these cells resembled those of random bifurcations it was concluded that the observed flatness already naturally emerges from random conditions. In the present study, a number of different geometrical <b>measures</b> of <b>flatness</b> has been developed and evaluated on their power for expressing the flatness of 3 D bifurcations. These measures are applied to bifurcations from rat visual cortex pyramidal basal dendrites, and to random bifurcations (i. e., bifurcations with random oriented segments in 3 D space). Frequency distributions of the various <b>flatness</b> <b>measures</b> of random and dendritic bifurcations appeared to be significantly different (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Dendritic bifurcations appeared to be more planar than random ones. In addition, parent segments in dendritic bifurcations have a strong preference to be aligned oppositely to the angular bisector of the daughter segments. These findings suggest that dendritic bifurcations are also formed under the influence of optimality constraints during the dendritic branching process. The <b>flatness</b> <b>measure</b> mos...|$|R
