The acoustic backscattering characteristics for two size classes of Maurolicus muelleri and Benthosema glaciale are reported here based on swimbladder morphology derived from digitized soft x-ray images, and empirical (in situ) measurements of target strength (TS) derived from an acoustic survey in a Norwegian Sea. A backscattering model based on a gas-filled prolate spheroid was used to predict the theoretical TS for both species across a frequency range between 0 and 250 kHz. Sensitivity analyses of the TS model to the modeling parameters indicate that TS is rather sensitive to the viscosity, swimbladder volume ratio, and tilt, which can result in substantial changes to the TS.

During the full moon phase the large zooplankton and micronekton of the <b>deep</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>layers</b> (DSL) would not reach the upper mixed layer in order to avoid predation because of the relatively high level of illumination. Thus epipelagic zooplankton abundance increases as the effect of a lower predatory pressure. Conversely, during the new moon phase the diel migrants reach the surface waters and epiplankton abundance considerably decreases. Recent oceanic sediment trap data in subtropical waters indicate that the particle flux increases at about 30 days period. Thus, the effect of diel vertical migrants could promote not only the variability in their resources and the intensity of the active flux, but could also drive the variability in the gravitational flux...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis reconnaissance {{is the first}} ecological study of the <b>deep</b> <b>scattering</b> <b>layers</b> (DSL) in the eastern tropical Pacific.

The reconnaissance is based on over 100 fathometer echograms and 100 trawls which fished for a period of one hour with an opening and closing Tucker midwater trawl. Echograms of two fathometer frequencies (30 Kc and 11 Kc) indicated that two latitudinal scattering zones may exist. Temperature, oxygen, light intensity, faunal composition, and swimbladder morphology were investigated with relation to the DSL. The oxyclines associated with the eastern Pacific oxygen minimum zone seemed to have little effect on the DSL. Possible further evidence for the migration of DSL organisms for feeding purposes was apparent as the maximum night surface scattering was observed at the depth of maximum Chlorophylla or phytoplankton. Frequency comparisons indicated a possible gradient of the size of organisms in the DSL with smaller organisms toward the top of the layer.

40|$|Increased {{pressure}} {{has been placed}} on researchers to focus on processes at an ecosystem level. However, ecological processes operate at multiple scales from an individual predator up to ocean basin migrations, and research across these scales is extremely difficult. More accurate and detailed understanding of prey distributions relative to physical and biological features can greatly aid in understanding top predator distributions and ultimately ecosystem functioning. High resolution acoustic data is a critical tool {{that can be used to}} investigate food web linkages at many spatial scales. At a broad scale, migratory top predators are often modeled relative to oceanographic structure as a proxy for the distribution of their prey. At a fine scale, combining novel technologies including fisheries acoustics, real time oceanographic sensors, and digital tags allows examination of decisions made by an individual foraging whale. In the Gulf of Mexico, fish distributions at fine scales (both horizontal and vertical) were examined relative to hypoxic bottom waters to understand potential ecosystem effects.
