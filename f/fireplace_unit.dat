50|$|The {{preassembled}} <b>fireplace</b> <b>unit</b> {{is made up}} of {{two main}} components: the outer housing, and the flue system.|$|E
50|$|To {{begin the}} {{operation}} of the <b>fireplace</b> <b>unit,</b> the user must turn on the gas supply and ignite the burners. Once this is done, the unit will operate completely autonomously until the gas supply to the burners is shut off. While in operation, convection will cause the hot air in the firebox to rise {{to the top of the}} firebox. As the amount of hot exhaust gasses increases from the combustion process, the hot gas at the top of the firebox is eventually pushed out through the inner flue. At the same time, the removal of the exhaust gasses through the inner flue allows for relatively cold air to be drawn into the firebox through the outer flue.|$|E
5000|$|The {{outer housing}} {{is the part}} of the <b>fireplace</b> <b>unit</b> that is {{installed}} in the framing of the building. Two of the main operational components are housed inside of it. The first key component within the outer housing is the firebox, which is surrounded on three sides by the outer housing, and on one side by the glass panel that faces in towards the room. This is the space in which the fire burns during operation. Because of this, the gas burners (either natural gas or propane) are located inside of the firebox. To provide a more realistic look, imitation logs and ember material are placed on top of the burners. The ember material, which will not burn, is designed so that it will glow like real embers when heated. The firebox is designed to be smaller than the outer housing so that there is an empty space between the outermost walls of outer housing and the outer walls of the firebox [...] The empty space in between the firebox and the outer housing is the second important operational component of the outer housing. This space is filled with air from the interior of the room being heated and is used to add hot air to the room without the addition of exhaust gasses from combustion.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>fireplace</b> <b>units</b> {{incorporate}} a blower which transfers {{more of the}} fireplace's heat to the air via convection, resulting in a more evenly heated space and a lower heating load. Fireplace efficiency can also be increased {{with the use of}} a fireback, a piece of metal that sits behind the fire and reflects heat back into the room. Firebacks are traditionally made from cast iron, but are also made from stainless steel. Efficiency is a complicated concept though with open hearth fireplaces. Most efficiency tests consider just the effect of heating of the air. An open fireplace is not, and never was, intended to heat the air. A fireplace with a fireback is a radiant heater, and has done so since the 15th century. The best way to gauge the output of a fireplace is if you notice you're turning the thermostat up or down.|$|R
5000|$|The Windsor Arms Apartments was {{designed}} by architect Cecil Burgess [...] and was completed on 1 April 1930 {{at the cost of}} $300,000 (1930 dollars), which the builder claimed to be 85% above the average cost of construction because of conveniences put into the structure. [...] The building's design features a detailed entrance portico, stained and leaded glass windows, and wood burning <b>fireplaces</b> in some <b>units.</b> When first tenanted, the building offered lobby and parking attendants and maid services.|$|R
40|$|Worldwide, nearly 3 billion people— 40 % of {{the global}} population—burn wood, coal, and other solid fuels every day to cook their food; this number is even larger when {{including}} those who heat their homes with solid fuels as well. Exposure to pollution from heating and cooking fires causes about 3 million deaths each year, {{making it one of}} the biggest environmental health problems the world faces. The harm from this smoke is not restricted to those who breathe it, however: it contains gases and particles that contribute to global climate change as well. Chapter 2 shows that household cooking with solid fuels caused an estimated 12 % of population-weighted ambient PM 2. 5 worldwide in 2010. Exposure to this air pollution caused the loss of 370, 000 lives and 9. 9 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) globally in the same year. In Chapter 3 I demonstrate that household heating with solid fuels caused an estimated 21 % of population-weighted ambient PM 2. 5 in 2010 in Central Europe, 13 % in Eastern Europe, 12 % in Western Europe, and 8 % in North America. Exposure to this air pollution results caused approximately 60, 000 premature deaths in Europe, and nearly 10, 000 deaths in North America, as well as an estimated 1. 0 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) in Europe and 160, 000 DALYs in North America. Chapter 4 addresses drivers of household wood combustion pollution in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the sector is the largest source of PM 2. 5 and regulators recently introduced amendments to wood burning rules for the airshed. Fireplaces are the source of the vast majority (84 %) of PM 2. 5 from residential wood combustion in the San Francisco Bay Area, despite their use primarily as an aesthetic or recreational combustion activity. By evaluating hypothetical fuel and combustion device changeouts, I find that replacing fireplaces with gas would yield significant health and economic benefits. Specifically, retrofitting frequently used <b>fireplaces</b> (300, 000 <b>units)</b> to gas inserts in the Bay Area’s nine counties would reduce sector emissions by about 90 %, avoiding approximately 140 - 310 premature deaths and 19, 000 lost days of work each year, and creating upwards of $ 1 billion in annual financial benefits from improved public health. Chapter 5 explains methodological overlaps and differences between the previous chapters. In Chapter 6, I explore the current regulatory and policy mechanisms specific to household heating with solid fuels, and relate these to the climate change implications associated with the sector. In Chapter 7, I highlight the relative dearth of data on household heating with biomass and its nuanced climate implications. This leads to a series of recommendations for future research, including collection of better household heating data in China and further work to understand how household combustion of biomass interfaces with both local air quality policy and climate change mitigation, outlining areas where this topic is currently visible in California...|$|R
