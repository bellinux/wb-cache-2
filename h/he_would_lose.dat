5|$|The biblical account {{states that}} Samson was a Nazirite, {{and that he}} was given immense {{strength}} to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with his bare hands and massacring an entire army of Philistines using only the jawbone of an ass. However, if Samson's long hair was cut, then his Nazirite vow would be violated, and <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> his strength.|$|E
5|$|According to Taum, {{the title}} Belenggu {{reflects}} the inner conflicts {{the main characters}} face that limit their actions. Taum points to {{the climax of the}} novel– in which Rohayah refuses to marry Sukartono because if she were to marry him <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> face because of her past– as a prime example of these limitations. Siregar notes that such a reading is supported by dialogue between Hartono and Sukartono, in which they note that humans are inherently held back by their reminiscences of the past.|$|E
25|$|Feuding {{over the}} Stampede North American Heavyweight Championship with Dan Kroffat {{throughout}} the fall, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> briefly <b>lose</b> the title to Kroffat on October 13 before regaining it several weeks later. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> eventually <b>lose</b> the title to Omar Atlas on November 9, 1973.|$|R
50|$|However, {{despite the}} boots' obvious {{importance}} to him, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> repeatedly <b>lose</b> them or have them stolen.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> not <b>lose</b> a match until 1999, against Daniel Lujan. Later {{that year}} in his 22nd bout {{with a record}} of 21 wins 1 defeat (11KO) he faced Ener Julio for the USBA light welterweight title, he won via a 12-round split decision. He later {{defeated}} Ener Julio again to defend his WBO light welterweight belt (which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> later <b>lose</b> to future undisputed welterweight champion Zab Judah).|$|R
5|$|During the 1930 season, Bob Quinn, {{the owner}} of the Red Sox, was in debt and afraid <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> the team due to foreclosure. To raise capital, he traded Ruffing to the New York Yankees for reserve outfielder Cedric Durst, $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and a $50,000 loan from Jacob Ruppert, the Yankees' owner. Ruffing ended his five-and-a-half year tenure with the Red Sox with a 39–93 win-loss record; his winning {{percentage}} (.289) was lower than that of the Red Sox during his tenure (.344).|$|E
5|$|Eleanor lobbied {{behind the}} scenes for the 1934 Costigan-Wagner Bill to make lynching a federal crime, {{including}} arranging a meeting between Franklin and NAACP president Walter Francis White. Fearing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> the votes of Southern congressional delegations for his legislative agenda, however, Franklin refused to publicly support the bill, which proved unable to pass the Senate. In 1942, Eleanor worked with activist Pauli Murray to persuade Franklin to appeal on behalf of sharecropper Odell Waller, convicted of killing a white farmer during a fight; though Franklin {{sent a letter to}} Virginia Governor Colgate Darden urging him to commute the sentence to life imprisonment, Waller was executed as scheduled.|$|E
5|$|Hardy {{teamed with}} real–life brother Jeff {{for the first}} time in the WWF in 1996, losing to teams such as The Smoking Gunns and The Grimm Twins on WWF television. Matt and Jeff would go on to have a short lived feud with The Headbangers (Thrasher and Mosh), losing to the duo twice in 1997. It was during this time that Matt and Jeff would {{experiment}} different ring names, at one stage being called Ingus (Matt) and Wildo Jinx (Jeff). In Matt's final singles match for the promotion before signing a full-time contract <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> to Val Venis on a taping of Shotgun in 1998.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> then <b>lose</b> the GHC Junior Heavyweight Championship back to Kenta via a Go 2 Sleep at the March 1st Pro Wrestling Noah event; coincidentally, Sasaki <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> the GHC Heavyweight Title {{later that}} night.|$|R
50|$|After beating title {{contender}} Arturo Morua, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> then <b>lose</b> a very disputed {{decision to}} IBO Light Welterweight World Champion Colin Lynes.|$|R
50|$|Labrador's {{long life}} ended tragically: <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{eventually}} <b>lose</b> {{his position in}} the diplomatic service, his wife, his sight, his judgment, and his fortune.|$|R
5|$|The 2009 {{film was}} {{originally}} conceived as an origin story, but the project {{evolved into a}} re-imagining of the first four Friday the 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer {{to feel a little}} sympathy for him, but not enough that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> his menace. In keeping with the tone of the film, Jason's mask was recreated from a mold of the original mask used for Part III; though there were subtle changes. Friday the 13th includes some of Harry Manfredini's musical score from the previous Friday the 13th films because the producers recognized its iconic status.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{served only}} {{five months in}} the office before the Conservatives were {{defeated}} in the 1923 general election. Ramsay MacDonald became the first Labour Prime Minister, but the Labour government fell within months, necessitating another general election. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated Labour candidate Oswald Mosley (who later led the British Union of Fascists). Believing <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> if he stood again in Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for Birmingham Edgbaston, the district of the city {{where he was born}} and which was a much safer seat which he would hold {{for the rest of his}} life. The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.|$|E
5|$|He fell badly out {{of shape}} before the 1993–94 season and was told by manager Dino Zoff to lose two stone (13kg) {{by the start of}} the {{campaign}} else <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> his first team place. Gascoigne went on an extreme weight loss diet and succeeded in shedding the excess fat. He kept his place in the team and captained the club against US Cremonese when regular captain Roberto Cravero was substituted. However, in April he broke his leg in training whilst attempting to tackle Alessandro Nesta. Upon his recovery he was disgruntled with new head coach Zdeněk Zeman's stern fitness approach, and both club and player decided to part ways {{at the end of the}} 1994–95 season.|$|E
25|$|Facing Buddy Landell and The Angel of Death {{during the}} next few months, he later {{appeared}} on the UWF's Superdome Extravaganza supercard defeating Art Crews at The Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana on November 27, 1986. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> later <b>lose</b> to One Man Gang in the opening rounds of the UWF/PWI Tournament the following month. During the next year, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> face Eli the Eliminator and, with Jeff Raitz, against Sting and Rick Steiner. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> later <b>lose</b> to Rick Steiner in a singles match at the Sam Houston Coliseum on January 23, 1987.|$|R
50|$|After {{dropping}} Dmitriy Salita in {{the first}} round, their bout would end in a very disputed draw. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> then <b>lose</b> a very close decision to David Diaz.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, Weatherly {{recorded}} six top-five finishes and ten top-tens. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> narrowly <b>lose</b> the 1959 Hickory 250 to Junior Johnson; being outlapped {{twice before}} the race was concluded.|$|R
5|$|Project Gemini {{followed}} on from Project Mercury, {{taking its}} name {{from the fact that it}} carried two men instead of just one. After the Mercury-Atlas 10 mission was cancelled, Shepard was designated as the commander of the first manned Gemini mission, with Thomas P. Stafford chosen as his pilot. In late 1963, Shepard began to experience episodes of extreme dizziness and nausea, accompanied by a loud, clanging noise in the left ear. He tried to keep it secret, fearing that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> his flight status, but was aware that if an episode occurred in the air or in space it could be fatal. Following an episode during a lecture in Houston, where he had recently moved from Virginia Beach, Virginia, Shepard was forced to confess his ailment to Slayton, who was now Director Flight Operations, and seek help from NASA's doctors.|$|E
5|$|At Money in the Bank 2011, Randy Orton {{defended the}} World Heavyweight Championship against Christian. The storyline {{started on the}} May 6 episode of SmackDown when Orton {{defeated}} Christian to become the champion {{less than a week}} after Christian had won the title. At Capitol Punishment on June 19, Orton defeated Christian to retain the title despite illegally pinning Christian. On the June 24 episode of SmackDown, Christian demanded another attempt at the title from SmackDown General Manager Theodore Long; his demand was granted with the proviso that he could defeat Kane. Christian lost the match against Kane by disqualification after interference from Mark Henry. Long then made a tag team match for later that same episode, pitting the team of Christian and Henry against Kane and Orton with a similar stipulation; Henry pinned Orton in the bout. Afterward, Long offered Henry an attempt at the title if Henry could defeat Orton again. Henry lost the match after Christian engineered a distraction. This set up a match between Orton and Christian for the title at Money in the Bank. On the July 8 episode of SmackDown, Christian's lawyers in the storyline added a stipulation to the match that if Orton was disqualified or there were poor officiating, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> the title to Christian.|$|E
5|$|At WrestleMania IX, Bret Hart {{dropped the}} WWF World Heavyweight Championship to Yokozuna. At the {{conclusion}} of the match, Mr. Fuji, Yokozuna's manager, threw salt in Hart's eyes, enabling Yokozuna to win the match. After the match, Hulk Hogan came to the ring to help Hart. Fuji challenged Hogan to a match for the WWF World Heavyweight Championship, which took place immediately. Fuji attempted to throw salt in Hogan's eyes, but Hogan moved and the salt hit Yokozuna instead. Hogan quickly defeated him to become the new WWF World Heavyweight Champion. Due to a real-life arrangement with WWF owner Vince McMahon, Hogan was supposed to lose the title to Bret Hart, but he changed his mind and refused to lose to Hart. He formed a compromise that allowed him to face Yokozuna in a rematch at King of the Ring 1993. He {{did not want to be}} pinned cleanly, so he insisted on a storyline in which <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> the belt due to outside interference. As a result of Hart's controversial loss, Jack Tunney, who played the on-screen role of WWF President, granted Hart entry into the King of the Ring tournament without requiring him to win a qualifying match.|$|E
50|$|On April 22, 2010 Carson Jones beat Jason LeHoullier by TKO {{to win the}} NABA light middleweight title. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> later <b>lose</b> {{the title}} to Rogerio Pereira by split decision.|$|R
50|$|Tucker {{would follow}} {{up the first}} loss of his {{professional}} career by racking up 14 consecutive victories, landing him another shot at the WBC Heavyweight championship against Lennox Lewis, though <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ultimately <b>lose</b> via unanimous decision.|$|R
50|$|On June 1, 1996, at Fight the Power, Durante {{defeated}} Shane Douglas {{to win the}} ECW World Television Championship. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> shortly <b>lose</b> {{the title}} to Chris Jericho in a match at Hardcore Heaven on June 22, 1996.|$|R
5|$|Born in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz, Kirchner studied {{law at the}} National University of La Plata. He met {{and married}} Cristina Fernández at this time, {{returned}} with her to Río Gallegos at graduation, and opened a law firm. Commentators have criticized him {{for a lack of}} legal activism during the Dirty War, an issue he would involve himself in as president. Kirchner ran for mayor of Río Gallegos in 1987 and for governor of Santa Cruz in 1991. He was reelected governor in 1995 and 1999 due to an amendment of the provincial constitution. Kirchner sided with Buenos Aires provincial governor Eduardo Duhalde against President Carlos Menem. Although Duhalde lost the 1999 presidential election, he was appointed president by the Congress when previous presidents Fernando de la Rúa and Adolfo Rodríguez Saá resigned during the December 2001 riots. Duhalde suggested that Kirchner run for president in 2003 in a bid to prevent Menem's return to the presidency. Menem won a plurality {{in the first round of}} the presidential election but, fearing that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> in the required runoff election, he resigned; Kirchner became president as a result.|$|E
5|$|The carnival's backstory {{begins at}} the end of the nineteenth century when Lucius Belyakov, a Russian aristocrat from Minsk and officer in the Tsar's army, became aware of his Avataric powers. The birth of his son Alexei evoked dark visions in him. After Belyakov's attempt to kill two-year-old Alexei, his wife fled with their two {{children}} to America, but news spread they perished in a train accident soon thereafter. Resuming his duties in Lemberg in 1914, Belyakov was again afflicted by dark visions. Henry Scudder, an American who had escaped prosecution for criminal activities in his home country by joining foreign armies, had had psychokinetic powers since childhood. At the time of Belyakov's visions, Scudder was stationed in Lemberg as an observer for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Belyakov became obsessed with killing his spiritual enemy (Scudder) and deserted his post, but an escaped circus bear feeding on the dead nearby surprised him in an attack. Belyakov was so gravely injured <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> an arm and both legs.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} a Falls Count Anywhere match between Randy Savage and Crush. The rules stated that any time a wrestler was pinned, he {{then had to}} make it back inside the ring within sixty seconds or <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> the match. Savage tried to attack Crush before the bell rang, but Crush {{reversed}} the attack. He used a tilt-a-whirl backbreaker to injure Savage and then dropped Savage across the guard rail to get the first pinfall. While Savage was returning to the ring, Mr. Fuji hit him with the Japanese flag to stall him. Savage made it back to the ring with two seconds remaining, so the match continued. Inside the ring, Crush tried to throw salt in Savage's eyes, but Savage countered by throwing the salt in Crush's eyes. Savage then performed a diving elbow drop and rolled Crush outside of the ring for the pinfall. Fuji helped revive Crush, which allowed Crush to return to the ring before the count had expired. Savage and Crush then brawled down the aisle and into a room backstage. Savage scored a pinfall and tied Crush's legs to a pulley. Crush was left hanging upside down and could not return to the ring, so Savage was declared the winner.|$|E

If a letter were intercepted, <b>he</b> (Martin) <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> his {{official}} position {{and he and his}} family would be endangered.|$|R
50|$|Defeating {{numerous}} British wrestlers including World Heavy Middleweight Champion Mark Rocco, British Mid-heavyweight Champion Chic Cullen and World Lightweight Champion Johnny Saint, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> eventually <b>lose</b> the World {{heavyweight title}} to Tony St. Clair in Hanley, England on May 8, 1982.|$|R
50|$|In November 1982, Philadelphia City Controller Thomas Leonard {{resigned}} {{his post}} and announced {{his intention to}} run for Mayor (<b>he</b> <b>would</b> ultimately <b>lose</b> the Democratic nomination to Wilson Goode). Vignola ran to succeed him, and was elected in November 1983.|$|R
5|$|Wilson's small {{majority}} {{after the}} 1964 general election {{had made the}} transaction of government business difficult, and in 1966 he called another election in which Labour gained a strong working majority of 96. Some older members of Heath's team, including Lloyd, retired from the front bench, making room {{for members of the}} next generation. Heath moved Maudling to the foreign affairs portfolio, and Douglas-Home took over Lloyd's responsibilities as spokesman on Commonwealth relations. Heath was widely seen as ineffective against Wilson, and as the 1970 general election approached there was concern within the party that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose,</b> and that Powell would seek to replace him as leader. Maudling and the chief whip, William Whitelaw, believed that if Heath had to resign Douglas-Home would be the safest candidate to keep Powell out. Douglas-Home shared their view that Labour would win the 1970 election, and that Heath might then have to resign, but he declined to commit himself. To the surprise of almost everyone except Heath, the Conservatives won the election, with a majority of 31 seats.|$|E
5|$|On the April 8 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Christian was {{defeated}} by Alberto Del Rio in a number one contender's match for the World Heavyweight Championship after a distraction from Brodus Clay. After Edge's sudden retirement from wrestling on the April 15 episode of SmackDown, Christian won a 20-man battle royal to determine who will face Del Rio for the vacant World Heavyweight Championship at Extreme Rules, where Christian defeated Del Rio to win the World Heavyweight Championship. On the May 6 episode of SmackDown, Christian lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Randy Orton. At the Over The Limit pay-per-view event, he failed to regain the championship from Orton. On the June 3 episode of SmackDown, Christian was the Special Referee for a World Heavyweight Championship defense by Orton against Sheamus. Orton went on to successfully defend the title. After the match, Christian hit Orton with the title belt, turning heel {{for the second time}} since 2005. At Capitol Punishment, Christian faced Orton for the World Heavyweight championship once again, however he failed to capture the title. At Money in the Bank, Christian won the World Heavyweight Championship, after Orton was disqualified for kicking him in the groin; the stipulation was if Orton was disqualified or the referee made a bad call, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> the title. At SummerSlam, Christian lost the World Heavyweight Championship to Orton in a No Holds Barred match. On the August 26 episode of SmackDown, special guest General Manager Bret Hart announced that Christian would face Orton in a steel cage match on the August 30 episode of SmackDown for the championship, in which Christian went on to lose the encounter, thus ending the feud. Christian then began feuding with Sheamus, leading to a match between the two at the Hell in a Cell and Vengeance pay-per-views, both of which Christian lost.|$|E
25|$|Douglas {{faced an}} ugly dilemma. If he {{rejected}} Dred Scott, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> Southern support he {{needed for the}} presidential election of 1860. If he embraced Dred Scott, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>lose</b> northern support. He tried to avoid both hazards, issuing a tepid endorsement of the decision, while continuing to assert popular sovereignty without explicitly saying the Court was wrong.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>would</b> then <b>lose</b> {{the title}} to Yodmongkol Vor Saengthep on November 29, 2013 {{in his first}} title defense in Chonburi via twelfth-round knockout. He had {{suffered}} a fracture of the orbital floor {{in the first round}} of this fight.|$|R
5000|$|Cavendish indeed left Plymouth for Brazil in August 1591, {{on a trip}} {{in which}} <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{eventually}} <b>lose</b> his life. Parchas describes the role the two Japanese played in the hanging of a Portuguese man accompanying them on the ship: ...|$|R
50|$|However {{given the}} {{majority}} that Fianna Fáil enjoyed within the government, Murphy realised {{that even if}} he could force a vote on the budget <b>he</b> <b>would</b> inevitably <b>lose</b> and so further debate on the issue would serve little purpose but to waste time.|$|R
