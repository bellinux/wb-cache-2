These include endoplasmic reticulum-associated protein degradation (ERAD) and mitochondria-associated degradation. In these processes, ATP hydrolysis by p97/CDC48 is required to extract aberrant proteins from the membranes of the ER or mitochondria. p97/CDC48 is also required to release <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> products stalled on ribosome in a process termed ribosome-associated degradation. [...] It appears that only after extraction from the membranes or large protein assembly like ribosome, can polypeptides be degraded by the proteasome. In addition to this ‘segregase’ function, p97/CDC48 might have an additional role in shuttling the released polypeptides to the proteasome. This chaperoning function seems to be particularly important for degradation of certain aggregation-prone misfolded proteins in nucleus. Several lines of evidence also implicate p97 in autophagy, a process that turns over cellular proteins (including misfolded ones) by engulfing them into double-membrane-surrounded vesicles named autophagosome, but the precise role of p97 in this process is unclear.|$|E

We have shown previously that mt tRNALeu(UUR) with a MELAS A 3243 G mutation and mt tRNALys with a MERRF A 8344 G mutation derived from HeLa background cybrid cells are deficient in normal taurine-containing modifications [τm 5 (s 2) U; 5 -taurinomethyl-(2 -thio) uridine] at the anticodon wobble position in both cases. The wobble modification deficiency results in <b>defective</b> <b>translation.</b> We report here wobble modification deficiencies of mutant mt tRNAs from cybrid cells with different nuclear backgrounds, as well as from patient tissues.

Since wobble base modifications are essential for translational efficiency and accuracy, we used mitochondrial components to estimate the translational activity in vitro of purified tRNALys carrying the mutation and found no mistranslation of non-cognate codons by the mutant tRNA, but almost complete loss of translational activity for cognate codons. This <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> was not explained by a decline in aminoacylation or lowered affinity toward elongation factor Tu. However, when direct interaction of the codon with the mutant tRNALys defective anticodon was examined by ribosomal binding analysis, the wild-type but not the mutant tRNALys bound to an mRNA– ribosome complex. We therefore concluded that the anticodon base modification defect, which is forced by the pathogenic point mutation, disturbs codon– anticodon pairing in the mutant tRNALys, leading to a severe reduction in mitochondrial translation that eventually {{could result in the}} onset of MERRF...|$|E
40|$|Myotonic {{dystrophy}} type 1 (DM 1) is {{the most}} common adult-onset muscular dystrophy, characterized by progressive myopathy, myotonia, and multi-organ involvement. This dystrophy is an inherited autosomal dominant disease caused by a (CTG) n expansion within the 3 ′ untranslated region of the DMPK gene. Expression of the mutated gene results in production of toxic transcripts that aggregate as nuclear foci and sequester RNA-binding proteins, resulting in mis-splicing of several transcripts, <b>defective</b> <b>translation,</b> and microRNA dysregulation. No effective therapy is yet available for treatment of the disease. In this study, myogenic cell models were generated from myotonic dystrophy patient-derived fibroblasts. These cells exhibit typical disease-associated ribonuclear aggregates, containing CUG repeats and muscleblind-like 1 protein, and alternative splicing alterations. We exploited these cell models to develop new gene therapy strategies aimed at eliminating the toxic mutant repeats. Using the CRISPR/Cas 9 gene-editing system, the repeat expansions were removed, therefore preventing nuclear foci formation and splicing alterations. Compared with the previously reported strategies of inhibition/degradation of CUG expanded transcripts by various techniques, the advantage of this approach is that affected cells can be permanently reverted to a normal phenotype...|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial energy {{production}} is a tightly regulated process involving the coordinated transcription of several genes, catalysis of {{a plethora of}} posttranslational modifications, {{and the formation of}} very large molecular supercomplexes. The regulation of mitochondrial activity is particularly important for the brain, which is a high-energy-consuming organ that depends on oxidative phosphorylation to generate ATP. Here we show that brain mitochondrial ATP production is controlled by the cytoplasmic polyadenylation-induced translation of an mRNA encoding NDUFV 2, a key mitochondrial protein. Knockout mice lacking the Cytoplasmic Polyadenylation Element Binding protein 1 (CPEB 1) have brain-specific dysfunctional mitochondria and reduced ATP levels, which is due to <b>defective</b> polyadenylation-induced <b>translation</b> of electron transport chain complex I protein NDUFV 2 mRNA.

To test this possibility we compared shutoff mechanisms in poliovirus- and EMC virus-infected HeLa cells. Striking differences were seen: poliovirus-induced shutoff was much more rapid and extensive than that induced by EMC virus; relative translation rates of certain host proteins were inhibited to different extents by the two viruses; initiation factors prepared from poliovirus-infected cells were specifically <b>defective</b> for <b>translation</b> of capped mRNA's in vitro, whereas those from EMC virus-infected cells were not.

The association of clinical and biological hypothyroidism with undetectable levels of serum thyroglobulin (Tg) {{and the presence}} of iodohistidines in the urine suggested the diagnosis of defective Tg gene expression. This conclusion was confirmed by analysis of proteins present in goiter extracts. Only minute amounts of Tg-related material was detected by RIA (0. 28 and 0. 17 mg/g tissue compared to 80 - 100 mg/g in normal thyroid tissue), by Sepharose 6 B chromatography, and by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Surprisingly, the goiters contained normal amounts of Tg mRNA. The size of the mRNA and the sequence organization of its first five exons also were normal. We conclude that no gross alteration of structure or transcription of the Tg gene was present in these patients. The results are compatible with a lesion affecting the mRNA sequence (point mutation, splicing error etc.), leading to <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> or abnormal routing of the translation product through the membrane system of the cell.

The initial phase of macrophage activation {{is followed by a}} refractory state called LPS tolerance characterized by an impaired TNF production in response to a secondary LPS challenge. LPS-tolerant macrophages contain high amounts of TNF mRNA, suggesting a translational regulation of TNF biosynthesis. The induction of LPS tolerance was studied in RAW 264. 7 macrophages stably transfected with a chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase (CAT) reporter gene construct driven by a constitutive cytomegalovirus promoter and containing the 3 ' untranslated region of the murine TNF gene. We found that primary stimulation of transfected cells by LPS (1 ng/ml, 12 hr) resulted in a marked suppression (80 %) of CAT accumulation in response to a secondary LPS challenge (1 microgram/ml, 6 hr). In contrast, the accumulation of CAT mRNA was not influenced by LPS tolerance. Using the same CAT reporter, we observed that the serine/threonine phosphatases 1 and 2 A inhibitor okadaic acid induced TNF mRNA translation and that this activation was not inhibited by LPS-tolerance. In conclusion, these data indicate that deficient production of TNF in LPS-tolerant macrophages in response to a second LPS challenge is characterized by a <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> of TNF mRNA.

While most organisms have only one ClpP, Mycobacterium tuberculosis has two ClpP protease subunits (ClpP 1 and ClpP 2) with {{at least one of them}} essential for growth. Co-expression of clpP 1 and clpP 2 was demonstrated showing that clpP 1 and clpP 2 are not expressed under different conditions. The promoter region of clpP 1 P 2 was identified, together with the potential ClgR binding site. A reporter system to assay ClpP 1 and ClpP 2 enzymatic activities was developed based on LacZ incorporating SsrA tag sequences. This showed that both ClpP 1 and ClpP 2 degrade SsrA-tagged LacZ, whilst only ClpP 2 degrades untagged proteins. This suggests different pattern recognition for the two ClpP proteins with substrate recognition by ClpP 1 dependent on the last three residues of the C-terminus of the tag sequence.

In the present study, the ribosomal assembly of β-globin chains was examined in the peripheral, nucleated red blood cells and reticulocytes of patients with Cooley's anemia, thalassemia intermedia, sickle thalassemia, sickle cell anemia, hemoglobin C disease, and in hemolytic anemias not associated with a hemoglobinopathy.

In thalassemia, no evidence was found for a delay in translation as the cause of the marked impairment of β-globin synthesis. In several specimens of peripheral blood from thalassemic patients, the translation time of the β-chain was even shorter than in nonthalassemic specimens (average time = 45 sec, range 35 - 59).

40|$|ABSTRACT During initial {{colonization}} {{and chronic}} infection, pathogenic bacteria encounter distinct host environments. Adjust-ing gene expression accordingly {{is essential for}} the pathogenesis. Pseudomonas aeruginosa has evolved complicated regulatory networks to regulate different sets of virulence factors to facilitate colonization and persistence. The type III secretion system (T 3 SS) andmotility are associated with acute infections, while biofilm formation and the type VI secretion system (T 6 SS) are associated with chronic persistence. To identify novel regulatory genes required for pathogenesis, we screened a P. aeruginosa transposon (Tn) insertion library and found suhB to be an essential gene for the T 3 SS gene expression. The expression of suhB was upregulated in a mouse acute lung infectionmodel, and loss of suhB resulted in avirulence. Suppression of T 3 SS gene ex-pression in the suhBmutant is linked to a <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> of the T 3 SSmaster regulator, ExsA. Further studies demonstrated that suhBmutation led to the upregulation of GacA and its downstream small RNAs, RsmY and RsmZ, triggering T 6 SS expres-sion and biofilm formation while inhibiting the T 3 SS. Our results demonstrate that an in vivo-inducible gene, suhB, reciprocally regulates genes associated with acute and chronic infections and plays an essential role in the pathogenesis of P. aeruginosa.

40|$|Abstract: Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (DM 1) is a multi-system {{disorder}} {{characterized by}} muscle wasting, myotonia, cardiac conduction defects, cataracts, and neuropsychological dysfunction. DM 1 {{is caused by}} expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3 ´untranslated region (UTR) of the Dystrophia Myotonica Protein Kinase (DMPK) gene. A body of work demonstrates that DMPK mRNAs containing abnormally expanded CUG repeats are toxic to several cell types. A core mechanism underlying symptoms of DM 1 is that mutant DMPK RNA interferes with the developmentally regulated alternative splicing of defined pre-mRNAs. Expanded CUG repeats fold into ds(CUG) hairpins that sequester nuclear proteins including human Muscleblind-like (MBNL) and hnRNP H alternative splicing factors. DM 1 cells activate CELF family member CUG-BP 1 protein through hyperphosphorylation and stabilization in the cell nucleus. CUG-BP 1 and MBNL 1 proteins act antagonistically in exon selection in several pre-mRNA transcripts, thus MBNL 1 sequestration and increase in nuclear activity of CUG-BP 1 both act synergistically to missplice defined transcripts. Mutant DMPK-mediated effect on subcellular localization, and defective phosphorylation of cytoplasmic CUG-BP 1, have additionally been linked to <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> of p 21 and MEF 2 A in DM 1, possibly explaining delayed differentiation of DM 1 muscle cells.

40|$|Mitochondrial protein {{translation}} {{is a complex}} process performed within mitochondria by an apparatus composed of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) –encoded RNAs and nuclear DNA–encoded proteins. Although the latter by far outnumber the former, {{the vast majority of}} mitochondrial translation defects in humans have been associated with mutations in RNA-encoding mtDNA genes, whereas mutations in protein-encoding nuclear genes have been identified in a handful of cases. Genetic investigation involving patients with <b>defective</b> mitochondrial <b>translation</b> led us to the discovery of novel mutations in the mitochondrial elongation factor G 1 (EFG 1) in one affected baby and, for the first time, in the mitochondrial elongation factor Tu (EFTu) in another one. Both patients were affected by severe lactic acidosis and rapidly progressive, fatal encephalopathy. The EFG 1 -mutant patient had early-onset Leigh syndrome, whereas the EFTu-mutant patient had severe infantile macrocystic leukodystrophy with micropolygyria. Structural modeling enabled us to make predictions about the effects of the mutations at the molecular level. Yeast and mammalian cell systems proved the pathogenic role of the mutant alleles by functional complementation in vivo. Nuclear-gene abnormalities causing mitochondrial translation defects represent a new, potentially broad field of mitochondrial medicine. Investigation of these defects is important to expand the molecular characterization of mitochondrial disorders and also may contribute to the elucidation of the complex control mechanisms, which regulate this fundamental pathway of mtDNA homeostasis...|$|R

The arrest activity is mediated by a discrete domain comprised of the Alu portion of SRP RNA and a 9 and 14 kDa polypeptide heterodimer (SRP 9 / 14). Although very few nucleotides in SRP RNA are conserved throughout evolution, the remarkable conservation of G 24, which resides {{in the region of}} SRP 9 / 14 interaction, suggests that it is essential for translation arrest. To understand the functional significance of the G 24 residue, we made single base substitutions in SRP RNA at this position and analyzed the ability of the mutants to bind SRP 9 / 14 and to reconstitute functional SRPs. Mutation of G 24 to C reduced binding to SRP 9 / 14 by at least 50 -fold, whereas mutation to A and U reduced binding approximately 2 - and 5 -fold respectively. The mutant RNAs could nevertheless assemble into SRPs at high subunit concentrations. SRPs reconstituted with mutant RNAs were not significantly <b>defective</b> in <b>translation</b> arrest assays, indicating that the conserved guanosine does not interact directly with the translational machinery.

Physical and genetic mapping confirmed that both the mutation and the cloned DNA were located at 15. 5 min on the E. coli chromosome at a locus designated feeB.

30|$|Mutations in {{mitochondrial}} tRNAs {{have been}} reported to be associated with various mitochondrial disease states (Abbott et al., 2014). With disrupted structures, mt tRNAs mutations would cause <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> and impaired mt protein synthesis, leading to defects in OXPHOS systems. Post-transcriptional processing, including maturation of primary tRNA, multiple chemical residue modifications, and aminoacylation, are critical to accurate and effective translation. Thus enzymes involved in these processing are highly possible modifier genes. The penetrance is much higher in the presence of nuclear mutations involved in transfer RNA base modification (MTO 1, TRMU-MTO 2, and GTPBP 3 genes) (Guan et al., 2006, Li and Guan, 2003, Li et al., 2002); however, additional supporting evidence is still needed to firmly confirm their role as genetic modifier. Establishment of ideal animal models may help discover their functions in mitochondrial diseases and explain their tissue specificity. Recent studies largely expand the phenotypic spectrum associated with different aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARS). McMilan et al. reported congenital visual impairment and progressive microcephaly has been associated with KARS mutations (McMillan et al., 2014) and Nakajima et al. reported a homozygous YARS 2 causes severe myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia 2 (Nakajima et al., 2014). Another whole-exome sequencing study reveals that mutations in VASR 2 and TARS 2 are the causes of mitochondrial encephalomyopathies (Diodato et al., 2014). Perli et al. further reported that isolated non-catalytic C-terminal of LASR 2 can improve both viability and bioenergetic proficiency of cybrid cells carrying pathogenic mutations in mt-tRNAs (Perli et al., 2014). These findings strongly suggest the group of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases as active modifying players in mitochondrial disorders, and may lead to further understanding of tissue specific mitochondrial diseases.|$|E

The acetylation polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of drug toxicity and with an increased frequency of certain cancers.

CAP increased the mobile fraction of the subunits, but not NDUFAF 4, and decreased the amount of CI, demonstrating that CI is relatively immobile and does not associate with NDUFAF 4. CAP increased the recovery kinetics of NDUFV 1 -AcGFP 1 to the same value as obtained with AcGFP 1 alone, indicative of the removal of unbound NDUFV 1 from the mitochondrial matrix. Conversely, CAP decreased the mobility of NDUFS 3 -AcGFP 1 and, to a lesser extent, NDUFB 6 -AcGFP 1, suggestive of their enrichment in less mobile subassemblies. Little, if any, change in mobility of NDUFA 2 -AcGFP 1 could be detected, suggesting that the dynamics of this accessory subunit of the matrix arm remains unaltered. Finally, CAP increased the mobility of NDUFAF 4 –AcGFP 1, indicative of interaction with a more mobile membrane-bound subassembly. Our results show that the protein interactions of CI subunits and assembly factors are differently altered when mitochondrial <b>translation</b> is <b>defective...</b>|$|R
40|$|Alternative {{initiation}} of {{translation of the}} human fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF- 2) mRNA at five in-frame CUG or AUG translation initiation codons requires various RNA cis-acting elements, including an internal ribosome entry site (IRES). Here we describe the purification of a trans-acting factor controlling FGF- 2 mRNA translation achieved by several biochemical purification approaches. We have identified the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A 1 (hnRNP A 1) as a factor that binds to the FGF- 2 5 '-leader RNA and that also complements <b>defective</b> FGF- 2 <b>translation</b> in vitro in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. Recombinant hnRNP A 1 stimulates in vitro translation at the four IRES-dependent initiation codons but {{has no effect on}} the cap-dependent initiation codon. Consistent with a role of hnRNP A 1 in the control of alternative {{initiation of}} translation, short interfering RNA-mediated knock down of hnRNP A 1 specifically inhibits translation at the four IRES-dependent initiation codons. Furthermore, hnRNP A 1 binds to the FGF- 2 IRES, implicating this interaction in the control of alternative initiation of translation...|$|R
40|$|The nuclear PET 122 gene from S. cerevisiae is {{necessary}} for translation of a single mitochondrial mRNA that encodes subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase. We report here the cloning and nucleotide sequence of PET 122, and properties of the predicted protein product, which consists of 242 residues. Analysis of PET 122 -lacZ translational fusions confirms that the PET 122 coding region is translated in vivo and indicates that the PET 122 protein product is targeted to mitochondria. A 117 residue domain located in the carboxy-terminal half of the PET 122 protein, {{at least part of}} which is shown by characterization of mutants to be critical for PET 122 function, exhibits 24 % identity and 59 % similarity to a portion of the catalytic domain of E. coli alanyl-tRNA synthetase. However, pet 122 mutants are not <b>defective</b> in mitochondrial <b>translation</b> per se, as would be expected if PET 122 encoded a tRNA synthetase. Instead, the PET 122 protein may carry out one or more activities in common with tRNA synthetases, such as binding of ATP or RNA...|$|R
40|$|In populations worldwide, the Hepatitis C Virus {{displays}} great diversity. The capsid gene, however, {{is remarkably}} conserved {{and this has}} led to predictions of RNA secondary structure and an overlapping, alternative reading frame (ARF). We investigated a role of the ARF in HCV infection, by introducing four stop codons into the ARF of a genotype 1 a H 77 molecular clone. These changes did not alter the capsid protein sequence, but were predicted to disrupt the RNA secondary structures, SLV and SLVI. An infection was launched after inoculation of the mutant HCV RNA into an HCV naÃ¯ve chimpanzee. The acute infection was attenuated with low peak viremia, minimal ALT elevation, and early virus control by a diverse adaptive immune response. Sequencing circulating virus revealed progressive reversions at the third and then fourth stop codon mutations. In cell culture, replication of a genome with the four stop codons was severely impaired, but the revertant genomes showed a marked improvement in replicative fitness. Consistent with the chimpanzee infection, reversions at stop codons 3 and 4 were also selected by passage of mutant, infectious HCV in cell culture. Genetic evidence for RNA structures that were disrupted by the stop codons was provided by structure-restoring compensating mutations that relieved the defective HCV replication. Further mutagenesis identified bases and secondary structure features critical for function; mutations in the top stem of SLVI severely impaired HCV replication. RNA bearing these mutations was less efficiently translated in cell free extracts. The effect of mutations in SLVI was reduced when the HCV replicase proteins were translated using a heterologous IRES. This data suggests that these RNA structures are important for translation from the HCV IRES and that the <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> exhibited by the SLVI mutants contributed to their impaired replication. Thus, RNA structures within the capsid coding region are responsible for modulating translation from the HCV IRES, and do not encode an ARF protein as had been postulated. While dispensable for the viability of subgenomic replicons, strong selective pressure for the integrity of these structures, both in vivo and in vitro, highlights their importance for the HCV lifecycle...|$|E
40|$|The ribosomal {{quality control}} complex (RQC) is a multiprotein complex which senses, modifies, and {{extracts}} defective protein products at the 60 S ribosomal subunit for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. Central to {{the function of}} the RQC is the RING finger E 3 ubiquitin ligase Ltn 1, which catalyzes the ubiquitylation and subsequent degradation of <b>defective</b> <b>translation</b> products. Listerin, the mammalian ortholog of Ltn 1, is crucial for early development and neuronal function, most likely preventing the formation of toxic protein aggregates in neurons. Little is known about how Listerin functions in mammalian cells. In Chapter 1, we show that Listerin and other mammalian RQC (mRQC) components interact with each other, {{as well as with the}} ribosome. Contrary to our expectations, mRQC interactions are not induced by widespread translational stalling. We also show that translational stress causes mRQC proteins to shift into biochemical fractions known to contain the 60 S ribosome. Because detection of endogenous E 3 ubiquitin ligase substrates presents a formidable challenge, traditional affinity purification and mass spectrometry (AP-MS) approaches are of limited use for this purpose. Chapter 2 details our use of tandem mass spectrometry to analyze potential Listerin substrates captured via three separate protein interaction mapping platforms: AP-MS, BioID, and APEX. Here, we describe two new classes of Listerin substrates: signaling kinases of the RSK family, and members of the tubulin glutamylation complex (TGC). In Chapter 3, we study the functional interactions between Listerin and the putative substrates identified in Chapter 2. We show that RSK 1, RSK 2 and a subset of TGC proteins are ubiquitylated by Listerin in a RING-dependent manner, and that this modification is consistent with regulatory polyubiquitylation. Additionally, we observe that disruption of Listerin positively regulates mTOR via RSK-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of TSC 2, and this novel function of Listerin is possibly independent of the mRQC. Taken together, our work demonstrates that mRQC proteins interact with each other and the ribosome, and these interactions are altered by translational stress. Our application of orthologous proteomic approaches led to the discovery of diverse Listerin substrates, opening the door to more detailed studies of this ligase with respect to human disease...|$|E
40|$|Cells try to {{counteract}} mitochondrial respiratory chain deficiencies via {{various kinds of}} largely unknown compensatory mechanisms, which {{play a central role}} in determining the extent of tissue-specific defects leading to disease phenotypes. In this study, we directly disrupted mitochondrial protein synthesis in mice by deleting the mitochondrial aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (Dars 2) gene in a tissue- specific manner. We generated DARS 2 deficiency in three different tissues (heart, skeletal muscle and forebrain neurons) and followed the dynamics and extent of pathological changes that occurred. Deficiency of this essential protein leads to severe deregulation of mitochondrial protein synthesis in both heart and skeletal muscle. Yet, mitochondrial stress responses, like increased biogenesis, decreased autophagy, upregulation of mitochondrial unfolded protein response and mitokine FGF 21, are only observed in DARS 2 -deficient cardiomyocytes. Surprisingly, the initiation of these stress responses is stemming from perturbed mitochondrial proteostasis, rather than the respiratory deficiency. Skeletal muscle, on the other hand, has intrinsic protective mechanisms that make it better equipped for folding and turnover of mitochondrial proteins, as well as slow turnover of mitochondrial transcripts that is coupled with possible upregulation of muscle regeneration. As a result, skeletal muscle is able to cope with increased levels of unassembled proteins better. Although DARS 2 depletion leads to very strong, deleterious respiratory deficiency in heart and skeletal muscle, causing animals to die within 7 - 8 weeks, its deficiency in forebrain neurons seems to have a milder effect that takes much longer time to develop. <b>Defective</b> mitochondrial <b>translation</b> in forebrain neurons caused abnormal behavior, and severe forebrain atrophy, which is caused by neuronal cell apoptosis and accompanied by activation of inflammatory responses such as microgliosis and reactive astrogliosis. Surprisingly, neurodegeneration occurred in an age-dependent manner and affected cortex and hippocampal regions differently...|$|R
40|$|Extracts of sporulating {{cells were}} found to be <b>defective</b> in vitro <b>translation</b> of phage SP 01 ribonucleic acid (RNA) and {{vegetative}} Bacillus subtilis RNA. The activity of washed ribosomes from sporulating cells was very similar to that of washed ribosomes from vegetative cells in translating polyuridylic acid, SP 01 RNA, and vegetative RNA. The S- 150 fraction from either vegetative or sporulating cells grown in Difco sporulation medium contained an apparent inhibitor of protein synthesis. The crude initiation factor fraction from ribosomes of sporulating cells was defective in promoting the initiation factor-dependent translation of SP 01 RNA. The crude initiation factor preparations from sporulating cells were as active as the corresponding preparations from vegetative cells in promoting the initiation factor-dependent translation of either phage Qbeta or phage T 4 RNA by washed Escherichia coli ribosomes. The crude initiation factors from sporulating cells were perhaps more active than those from vegetative cells in promoting the initiation factor-dependent synthesis of phage T 4 lysozyme by E. coli ribosomes. The crude initiation factor preparations from either vegetative or stationary-phase cells of an asporogenous mutant showed similar ability to promote the in vitro translation of SP 01 RNA...|$|R
40|$|Defects of {{mitochondrial}} {{protein synthesis}} are clinically and genetically heterogeneous. We previously described a male infant {{who was born}} to consanguineous parents and who presented with severe congenital encephalopathy, peripheral neuropathy, myopathy, and lactic acidosis associated with deficiencies of multiple mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymes and <b>defective</b> mitochondrial <b>translation.</b> In this work, we have characterized four additional affected family members, performed homozygosity mapping, and identified a homozygous splicing mutation in the splice donor site of exon 2 (c. 504 + 1 G>A) of RMND 1 (required for meiotic nuclear division- 1) in the affected individuals. Fibroblasts from affected individuals expressed two aberrant transcripts and had decreased wild-type mRNA and deficiencies of mitochondrial respiratory-chain enzymes. The RMND 1 mutation caused haploinsufficiency that was rescued by overexpression of the wild-type transcript in mutant fibroblasts; this overexpression increased the levels and activities of mitochondrial respiratory-chain proteins. Knockdown of RMND 1 via shRNA recapitulated the biochemical defect of the mutant fibroblasts, further supporting a loss-of-function pathomechanism in this disease. RMND 1 belongs to the sif 2 family, an evolutionary conserved group of proteins that share the DUF 155 domain, have unknown function, and have never been associated with human disease. We documented that the protein localizes to mitochondria in mammalian and yeast cells. Further studies are necessary for understanding the function of this protein in mitochondrial protein translation.

40|$|ABSTRACT Alcoholic {{myopathy}} {{is characterized}} by selective atrophy of type II fibers and affected subjects lose up to 20 % of the entire musculature. Between oneand two-thirds of all alcohol abusers are affected. In acute studies, <b>defective</b> rates of <b>translation</b> occur and type II fiber-predominant muscles are more adversely affected than type I fiber-predominant muscles. Furthermore, acetaldehyde is also a potent modulator of translation, and contractile and noncontractile proteins are affected equally. In chronic ethanol feeding there is rapid and sustained loss of ribosomal RNA. Recent attention {{has focused on the}} observation that total messenger RNA (mRNA) falls after ethanol consumption, but mRNA for specific myofibrillary contractile proteins are unaffected, implicating a role for translational modifications in the initial stages of the myopathy. Clinical studies have also shown that chronic alcohol abusers have defective rates of muscle protein synthesis and whole-body protein metabolism. The modulations in transcription and translation are not mediated by availability of amino acids, the effects of endocrine dysfunction (cortisol and growth hormone), liver impairment, or malnutrition. Free radicals, however, may be contributory mediators. Receptormediated events and the putative roles of growth factors are generally unexplored, though a distinguishing feature of acute ethanol administration is a reduction in circulating IGF-I. Thus, ethanol may act directly on muscle, although other concordant processes may coexist. ...|$|R
