The MITRE-developed Keystone formatting simultaneously and automatically compensates for range walk due to the radial velocity component of each moving target, independent {{of the number of}} targets or the value of each target's radial velocity with respect to the ground. Target radial motion also causes moving targets in synthetic aperture radar images to appear at locations offset from their true instantaneous locations on the ground. In a multichannel radar, the interferometric phase values associated with all nonmoving points on the ground appear as a continuum of phase differences while the moving targets appear as interferometric phase discontinuities. By multiple threshold comparisons and grouping of pixels within the intensity and the phase images, we show {{that it is possible to}} reliably detect and accurately <b>georegister</b> moving targets within short-duration SAR (QuickSAR) images.|$|R

40|$|A {{range of}} {{programs}} exist globally that use satellite imagery to derive estimates of vegetation-cover for developing vegetation-management policy, monitoring policy compliance and making natural-resource assessments. Consequently, the satellite imagery {{must have a}} high degree of geometric accuracy. It is common for the accuracy assessment to be performed using the root mean square error (RMSE) only. However the RMSE is a non-spatial measure and more rigorous accuracy assessment methods are required. Currently {{there is a lack of}} spatially explicit accuracy assessment methods reported in the literature that have been demonstrated to work within operational monitoring programs. This paper reports on the method used by the Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) to <b>georegister</b> and assess the registration accuracy of Landsat- 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat- 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) imagery in Queensland, Australia. A geometric baseline with high accuracy (a statewide mean RMSE of 4. 53 m) was derived by registering Landsat- 7 ETM+ panchromatic imagery acquired in 2002 to a database of over 1600 control points, collected on the ground using a differential global positioning system. Landsat- 5 TM and Landsat- 7 ETM+ imagery for 12 selected years from 1988 to 2007 was registered to the baseline in an automated procedure that used linear geometric correction models. The reliability of the geometric correction for each image was determined using the RMSE, calculated using independent check points, as an indicator of model fit; by analysing the spatial trends in the model residuals; and through visual assessment of the corrected imagery. The mean RMSE of the statewide coverage of images for all years was less than 12. 5 m (0. 5 pixels). Less than 1 percent of images had non-linear spatial trends in the model residuals and some image misregistration after applying a linear correction-model; in those cases a quadratic model was deemed necessary for correction. Further research in the development of automated spatially explicit accuracy assessment methods is required...|$|R

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented for video georegistration, {{with a particular}} concern for aerial video, i. e., video captured from an airborne platform. The algorithm's input is a video stream with telemetry (camera model specification sufficient to define an initial estimate of the view) and geodetically calibrated reference imagery (coaligned digital orthoimage and elevation map). The output is a spatial registration of the video to the reference so that it inherits the available geodetic coordinates. The video is processed in a continuous fashion to yield a corresponding stream of <b>georegistered</b> results. Quantitative results of evaluating the developed approach with real world aerial video also are presented.

40|$|Accessibility to {{consistent}} subsurface hydrostratigraphic {{information is}} crucial {{for the development of}} robust groundwater flow and contaminant transport models. However, full three-dimensional understanding of the subsurface geology is often the missing link. Construction of watershed-scale hydrostratigraphic models continues to be limited by the quality and density of borehole data which often lack detailed geologic information. This can become a serious problem where rapid sediment facies changes and intricate sediment architecture occur. This research is motivated by the idea that if we can understand more about the distribution of sediments and structures of complex deposits, we learn more about depositional processes and how they affect the internal geometry of a deposit and the distribution of hydraulic properties. One approach is to study surficial excavations (e. g. sand and gravel pits) that often punctuate shallow aquifers. The {{purpose of this study is}} to develop and test a method of integrating high-resolution georeferenced stratigraphic and sedimentologic information from sand and gravel pits as a means to better document sedimentologic data and improve understanding of the depositional environments. The study area is located within the Waterloo Moraine, in southwestern Ontario, and is an unconsolidated shallow aquifer system with a complex internal architecture and sediment heterogeneity. The method involves the integration of high-resolution field data with borehole and geophysical information in a computer-based 3 D environment. A total of fourteen virtual sedimentary sections were constructed by <b>georegistering</b> digital photographs within a framework of georeferenced positions collected using a reflectorless total station and GPS. Fourteen sediment facies have been described in the field. These include crudely stratified gravel beds, planar and cross-laminated sandy strata (ripple and dune scales), along with laminated and massive silty and clayey beds. Calculated hydraulic conductivities span over seven orders of magnitude. The analysis of a single excavation has shown contrasting sediment assemblages from one end of the pit to the other, highlighting the complexity of the Waterloo Moraine. The heterogeneous and deformed layers of gravel, sand, and mud may be the product of an ice-contact to ice-proximal environment, whereas the extensive sandy assemblages may reflect an intermediate subaqueous fan region. The results also suggest that the borehole database overestimates the amount of fine-grained material in the study area. Finally, this research demonstrates that it is possible to build in a timely manner a 3 D virtual sedimentologic database. New emerging technologies will lead to increased resolution and accuracy, and will help streamline the process even further. The possibility of expanding the 3 D geodatabase to other excavations across the region in a timely manner is likely to lead to improved hydrostratigraphic models and, by extension, to more efficient strategies in water resources planning, management and protection...|$|R

40|$|A {{portable}} {{radiation detector}} and mapping system (RADMAPS) {{has been developed}} to detect, locate and plot nuclear radiation intensities on commercially available digital maps and other images. The field unit records gamma-ray spectra or neutron signals together with positions from a Global Positioning System (GPS) on flash memory cards.

The system presently records spectra from a Nal(Tl) gamma-ray detector or an enriched Li- 6 doped glass neutron scintillator. Standard Geographic Information System software installed in a lap-top, complete with CD-ROM supporting digitally imaged maps, permits the characterization of nuclear material in the field when the presence of such material is not otherwise documented.

40|$|Georegistration of {{an image}} {{typically}} requires either 3 - 5 control points measured in the target image or 6 - 10 tie points to at least two <b>georegistered</b> reference images. Often control points are not available, and tie points are difficult to find across sensor types, particularly for automatic processes. This work shows that registration {{can be achieved by}} measuring 3 - 5 lines in a target image and two reference images. The same ultimate registration accuracy can be achieved with tie points alone, lines alone, or a combination of both. Line triangulation enables automatic cross-sensor georegistration since lines can be found reliably across sensor types. Lines are measured by indicating two or more image positions on corresponding lines in each image. There is no need to identify corresponding points between images. There is no need for a priori line information, but such information can be exploited. Initial estimates of the lines can be made from the image measurements and a priori sensor models. The evaluation of image registration accuracy is discussed. Examples of image registration with line triangulation are presented...|$|E

40|$|Given the UHF bands {{properties}} of foliage and round penetration, a UHF-SAR image contains both above- and below-surface scatterers. The problem of detecting sub-surface objects is problematic {{due to the}} presence of above-surface scatterers in the detection images. In case of a single-pass anomaly image or a two-pass change image, the resulting anomalies or changes are due to scatterers above and below the surface, where the above surface anomalies/changes act as confusers. LIDAR digital elevation models (DEM) provide <b>georegistered</b> information about the above-surface objects present in the UHF-SAR scene. Detection of the above-surface objects in the LIDAR domain is used to rule out above-surface false-alarms in the UHF-SAR domain detection images. A complementary sensor fusion algorithm is implemented which exploits the limited ground penetrating capabilities of UHF-SAR and the false-alarm removal using LIDAR. For unitemporal and multitemporal UHF-SAR collections (both containing multiple-passes and multiple- polarizations) anomaly detection and change detection are implemented, respectively. In this thesis, various pixel-based and feature-based change detection algorithms are implemented to study the effectiveness of multitemporal change detection algorithms. In addition, incorporation of UHF-SAR multiple-passes and multiple-polarizations further improves detection results. The algorithms are tested using data collected under JIEDDOs Halite- 1 program, which provides both UHF-SAR and LIDAR DEM...|$|E

40|$|The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) is 2 {{years into}} a 3 -year cycle {{to create new}} digital {{topographic}} map products for the conterminous United States from data acquired and maintained as part of The National Map databases. These products are in the traditional, USGS topographic quadrangle, 7. 5 -minute (latitude and longitude) cell format. The 3 -year cycle was conceived to follow the acquisition of National Aerial Imagery Program (NAIP) orthorectified imagery, a key layer in the new product. In fiscal year (FY) 2009 (ending September 30, 2009), {{the first year of}} the 3 -year cycle, the USGS produced 13, 200 products. These initial products of the “Digital Map-Beta ” series had limited feature content, including only the NAIP image, some roads, geographic names, and grid and collar information. The products were created in layered <b>georegistered</b> Portable Document Format (PDF) files, allowing users with freely available Adobe® Reader ® software to view, print, and perform simple Geographic Information System-like functions. In FY 2010 (ending September 30, 2010), the USGS produced 20, 380 products. These products of the “US Topo ” series added hydrography (surface water features), contours, and some boundaries. In FY 2011 (ending September 30, 2011), the USGS will complete the initial coverage with US Topo products and will add additional feature content to the maps. The design, development, and production associated with the US Topo products provide management and technical challenges for the USGS and its public and private sector partners. One challenge is the acquisition and maintenance of nationally consistent base map data from multiple sources. Another is the use of these data to create a consistent, current series of cartographic products that can be used by the broad spectrum of traditional topographic map users.

Second, we are proposing to develop new methods to image below-ground data accurately and efficiently. These methods are especially suited to modeling the wealth of subsurface information at archaeological sites. Third, we will be developing new database technology to catalog and access a site’s structures, artifacts, objects, and historical references. This will significantly improve a user’s ability to query and analyze a site’s information. Fourth, we have created a wearable augmented reality system for presenting <b>georegistered</b> information to mobile users, using overlaid graphics and sound. We will extend this system to create a new class of information visualization systems that integrate 3 D above- and below-ground models, 2 D images, text and other web-based resources to annotate the physical environment We will apply this system to support scientists in the field, as well to allow on-site and remote tours of historic and ancient sites. We are intrigued by the possibility of an historic site serving as the nexus for introducing complex ideas from a variety of disciplines: mathematics, earth sciences, economics, geography, literature, languages, politics, and history.
