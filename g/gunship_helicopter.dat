This small force is commanded by a colonel.|$|R
50|$|Eventually, the MRF {{included}} Army floating {{artillery and}} mortar barges, {{which could be}} moved throughout the Delta and positioned to support the planned area of each assault operation. Integral air support came from newly created Navy <b>gunship</b> <b>helicopter</b> squadron HAL 3 (Helicopter Attack, Light), the SEAWOLVES, based at Dong Tam a unit of CTF 116. This was additional to such air support, both troop insertion and gunfire ships, as the Army tasked to each operation, and air support from Air Force TAC air units on call.|$|E
5000|$|The assault {{helicopters}} {{in single}} file encountered winds that caused them to break formation 150 yd {{to the right of}} their intended track. The pilots of Apple 03, the <b>gunship</b> <b>helicopter</b> preceding the others, observed a compound nearly identical to the prison camp in size and layout (previously labeled a [...] "secondary school" [...] by intelligence sources) and steered toward it, followed by the assault lift force. However, they recognized their error when they saw the river next to the actual location and corrected their flight path. Banana, the HH-3E carrying the Blueboy assault team, descended on the wrong location and observed that the expected courtyard was much smaller than required and that the expected treeline enclosed the compound rather than crossing through it. By that time, Blueboy (as previously rehearsed) was firing its weapons from all openings in the helicopter. Bananas pilots also recognized the error, applied power, and quickly veered north to the actual target.|$|E
40|$|A {{wind tunnel}} {{investigation}} of the engine exhaust and windstream flow interaction on a <b>gunship</b> <b>helicopter</b> model was conducted in the Langley V/STOL tunnel. The investigation utilized a flow visualization technique employing neutrally buoyant helium filled bubbles to {{determine the cause of}} exhaust shield overheating during cruising flight and to evaluate means of eliminating the problem. The flow patterns were recorded with still cameras and on television magnetic tape. Exhaust flow impingement on the exhaust shield during cruise was found to cause the problem. Several flow altering devices were evaluated to find suitable ways to correct the problem. A flow deflector located on the model cowling upstream of the exhaust provides an effective solution...|$|E

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of {{dedicated}} <b>gunship</b> <b>helicopters</b> such as the AH-1 Cobra (since 1967) and later the AH-64 Apache, armament subsystems for non-specific types would begin to drop off, with mostly defensive armament packages remaining. Such armament packages, giving decidedly heavy armament to small or primarily transport helicopters, have become popular among second and third world countries who lack the funds for dedicated attack helicopters. Most of those systems bear some resemblance to the plethora of US systems that follow in this entry.|$|R
