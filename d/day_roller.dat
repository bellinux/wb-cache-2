5000|$|Septencoracias {{was a small}} bird {{the size}} of a Northern carmine bee-eater, Merops nubicus, or about 25 cm in length. It had a large skull in {{comparison}} to its body, about twice the length of the humerus. It is much larger than modern <b>day</b> <b>rollers</b> and its sister taxon Primobucco, more similar in size and proportion to kingfishers, motmots, and bee-eaters. It had a stout, slightly curved beak, and the upper ridge of the beak curves gradually towards the tip of the bill like in living roller species. This is different from Primobucco which has stronger curvature on the anterior end of the beak. It had small, egg-shaped nasal openings, much different than any of its close extinct relatives or extant rollers, which have either elongated openings, slit-like openings, or large triangular nares.|$|R

The song was sung by Lotta Engberg {{of the group}} Triple & Touch at the Swedish Melodifestivalen 1988, where it finished third with 47 points. The song text describes the <b>days</b> as a <b>roller</b> coaster, but it's also about love.|$|R
50|$|A {{pleasure}} railroad partially {{constructed in}} 1890-1891 and never finished. The {{first part of}} the ride would have taken the cars up two inclined planes to the summit 900 ft above the Hudson River, where visitors could disembark to enjoy the scenery. Then the cars would have coasted by gravity down a nine-mile (14 km) scenic railway, making two spirals and three switchbacks. It would have been to this <b>day</b> the biggest <b>roller</b> coaster ever constructed.|$|R
2500|$|Centrifugal Railway was {{the name}} of a number of early looping roller {{coasters}} that were built in Western Europe {{in the middle of the}} 19th century. These rides were very similar in their basic design to many modern <b>day</b> shuttle <b>roller</b> coasters (i.e., they did not make a complete circuit), but with only one lift hill and no launch. A single roller coaster car would ascend to the peak on the coaster before descending rapidly down the same hill and then passing through the central loop with enough speed and centrifugal force to remain on the track at the top of the loop. The size of these centrifugal railways differed; some were purported to have vertical loops of a mere , while others were estimated to be [...] (although, as described below, early coaster designers were prone to cases of gross exaggeration).|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of the old}} Knights of Pythies Hall in Amador City, ca. 1930. At center a {{building}} that is at least two stories tall is visible {{on the side of}} a slope. Four windows, two per story, are visible on the front-facing wall. The two windows on the top story have shutters, while two additional windows are visible on the right wall. Two doors are visible on the right wall, and the building has a sloped roof. A dirt road runs from bottom center to the bottom right in front of the building. Trees and hills are visible in the background. Photoprint reads: "Amador City - The old Knights of Pythies Hall is on a slope overlooking the town. The road leads to Dog Town - note the green window shutters. This was before the <b>days</b> of <b>roller</b> shades"...|$|R
5000|$|A {{short time}} later, {{a blind man}} and his guide dog {{disappear}} in the building. The two guards {{from the beginning of}} the film discover the dog's corpse hanging from its collar on a shaft support. The discovering guard's head is caught between the elevator doors. He is decapitated a short while later, his partner too horrified to help him. Once again, the METEOR executives find nothing wrong with the elevators. Evans interviews Newman, who sarcastically states [...] "Nine people out of ten make it out of an elevator alive." [...] Evans places this in her report, causing a large controversy over his statement by his boss, Mitchell (Ron Perlman) and the police. During the same <b>day,</b> a <b>roller</b> skater is sucked into an elevator in the parking garage and shot from the 86th floor of the building to his death. The roller skater's death is explained to media as suicide.|$|R

50|$|In 1902, early {{forms of}} moving {{pictures}} began following their introduction at the Paris Exhibition. This combination of moving pictures, 'movies' and music hall acts in a mixed programme, proved successful until 1909 when the theatre {{was purchased by}} P. Stobie & Son, who installed a flat maple floor {{to take advantage of}} the late Victorian craze for roller skating. It seems to have been too late in the <b>day</b> for a <b>Roller</b> Skating Rink for County Ladies and Gentlemen, for the theatre took on a new identity as 'The Electric Theatre' and continued to play an important part in the development of cinema. The 'Auld Hippie' or 'The Scratch' as it was affectionately known succumbed to the competition of television and closed in October 1954.|$|R
5000|$|Quality cigars {{are still}} handmade. An {{experienced}} cigar-roller can produce hundreds of very good, nearly identical, cigars per <b>day.</b> The <b>rollers</b> keep the tobacco moist — especially the wrapper — and use specially designed crescent-shaped knives, called chavetas, {{to form the}} filler and wrapper leaves quickly and accurately. Once rolled, the cigars are stored in wooden forms as they dry, in which their uncapped ends are cut to a uniform size. From this stage, the cigar is a complete product that can be [...] "laid down" [...] and aged for decades if kept as close to 21 °C (70 °F), and 70% relative humidity. Once purchased, proper storage is typically in a specialized wooden humidor. Some cigars, especially premium brands, use different varieties of tobacco for the filler and the wrapper. Long filler cigars are a far higher quality of cigar, using long leaves throughout. These cigars also use a third variety of tobacco leaf, called a [...] "binder", between the filler and the outer wrapper. This permits the makers to use more delicate and attractive leaves as a wrapper. These high-quality cigars almost always blend varieties of tobacco. Even Cuban long-filler cigars will combine tobaccos {{from different parts of}} the island to incorporate several different flavors.|$|R
500|$|On October 20, 2004, SeaWorld Parks & Entertainment (owner of Busch Gardens Tampa Bay) filed a {{trademark}} {{for the name}} [...] "SheiKra". A week later, Busch Gardens Tampa Bay announced SheiKra, North America's first Dive Coaster, {{as part of a}} deal with Bolliger & Mabillard. At the time of the announcement, about half of the ride's foundations were complete. Superior Rigging & Erection constructed the supports and track of SheiKra and by January 28, 2005, the roller coaster's highest track piece was placed along with an evergreen tree. Testing began in late April 2005 after the track had been constructed. After testing was completed, a media day was held on May 19, 2005, for international media outlets to promote the ride. Two <b>days</b> later, the <b>roller</b> coaster opened to the public on May 21, 2005. During SheiKra's first year of operation, its computer systems experienced problems as it would halt operations when it sensed that pumps and compressors were not working as they should. This caused riders to get stranded on the roller coaster and be forced to evacuate.|$|R
40|$|CERTAIN {{strains of}} mice, such as C 3 H, exhibit a recessively {{inherited}} retinal dystrophy. This {{takes the form}} of a degeneration and complete disappearance of the visual cell layer; it begins on or about the 1 lth day of life and is nearly com-plete by the 19 th <b>day</b> (Sorsby, <b>Roller,</b> Attfield, Davey, & Lucas, 1954). The pro-cess is remarkably uniform from litter to litter (Lucas & Newhouse, 1957). In a previous paper (Lucas & Trowell, 1958) it was shown that eyes and retinae taken from 10 -day-old normal (CBA) mice could be maintained in vitro for 8 days, during which time their structure was fairly well preserved and differentia-tion proceeded. In the present work, eyes and retinae from dystrophic strains of mice have been cultured over a similar period to see if the dystrophy developed in vitro. MATERIAL The eyes or retinae of 25 animals from 3 litters of the C 3 H strain, maintained at the M. R. C. Radiobiological Unit, Harwell, and from 2 litters of the retinal dystrophy (Bruckner) strain maintained at the Royal College of Surgeons, were explanted. The retinal condition is histologically identical in the two strains and in Fi hybrids. Details of breeding experiments showing the genetic identity of the two strains have been reported elsewhere (Lucas, 1958). Two groups of mice were used, the one 9 - 10 days old (12 animals), the other 11 - 12 days old (13 animals). Retinae from a number of normal CBA-mice of the stock maintained at Harwell were explanted as in vitro controls. METHODS The cultural and histological methods were as described in the previous paper (Lucas & Trowell, 1958). Each experiment was performed on a group of litter-mates. As controls, the eyes of one mouse were fixed when the cultures were set...|$|R
40|$|PT. Coca-Cola Amatil Indonesia is {{a company}} that {{produces}} carbonated beverages. Most of the production activity uses automatic machines. The problem faced is the damage that often occurs suddenly on the blowmould machine so that corrective maintenance must be done. The purpose of this research is to know the cause of the damage and to propose the action plan to minimize downtime. The method used is Reliability Centered Maintenance to determine the selection of action and time interval of replacement for critical components on the blowmould machine. From the FMEA analysis, it is known that the critical components of each blowmould machine subsystem are bearing roller feed, mandrel, seal gasket, and fitting. The results of LTA analysis are the category of failure (outage problem and economic problem) and the selection of action for the critical component (time directed). From the calculation of Total Minimum Downtime, known that the replacement schedule for critical component are 23 <b>days</b> for bearing <b>roller</b> feed, 9 <b>days</b> for mandrel, 8 days for seal gasket, and 8 days for fitting, that is resulting in decreased downtime of 1. 56 % with a value of 99. 63 % availabilit...|$|R
5000|$|The SR1 steam roller was Mamod's first mobile steam toy. It was {{introduced}} in January 1961, designed by Eric Malins. The first rollers were unidirectional and only travelled in a 'forward' direction (at an un-steam roller like speed). The engines featured a modified MM2 steam unit complete with characteristic rolls made of aluminium alloy. Like the early TE1s of 1963 and the stationary range, the early SR1 rollers were of screw construction and also featured a brass vaporising lamp rivetted to the scuttle. They had no tow hook. From 1963, a revised burner was used (as {{was introduced}} with the TE1 steam tractor), the handle of which formed a tow hook; although it would be 1969 before it had anything for it to tow, {{with the introduction of}} the OW1 Open Wagon and LB1 Lumber Wagon. From 1965 the roller was put together using pop rivets (like all the Mamod range of steam toys) - as a result it is easy to distinguish early 1960s rollers from later ones. In 1967 the SR1 became the SR1a with the introduction of a simple reversing mechanism on the engine unit. The mechanism was similar to the 1965 MEC1 Meccano engine. In the same way, the TE1 became a TE1a. In 1968 the aluminium rollers and wheels were replaced by Mazak items; the same material is used to this <b>day.</b> The <b>roller</b> has remained in the Mamod range for 50 years now and has undergone small incremental changes over this time, with modifications to the burner (moving to solid fuel circa 1976) and sight glass boilers replacing the over flow plug type (circa 1978). The only other changes have been largely cosmetic: paint, whistles, smoke box detailing. Early boxed SR1 engines now command strong prices and are sometimes referred to as [...] "nut and bolt" [...] SRs by collectors. Lately other variations of roller have included limited editions in different colours as well as longer boiler versions and also a kit version. Mamod's first mobile steam toy continues to sell well in the 21st century.|$|R
