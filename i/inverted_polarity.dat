At low (< 1 O- 5 M) concentrations of GABA, pentobarbital(lO 0 PM) potentiated the responses {{by a factor of}} 10 or more, but responses to high (ca. 1 mM) concentrations of GABA were almost unchanged. Half-maximal activation of the response was obtained with about 3 x 10 -S M GABA when applied alone and with about 4 x 1 O- 6 M GABA when applied together with 100 PM pentobarbital. At low doses of GABA, the size of the current increased as the 1. 4 th power of GABA concentration, but this relationship became nearly linear in the presence of pentobarbital. The potentiation of the GABA response increased linearly with concentrations of pentobarbital up to about 300 PM, reaching a maximum of about 50 -fold. At higher concentrations of pentobarbital, the response to GABA declined. Relaxations of GABA-activated currents following voltage steps became slower in the presence of pentobarbital, suggesting that the open lifetime of the channels was prolonged. In addition to actions on GABA-activated currents, pentobarbital itself elicited a small membrane current that <b>inverted</b> <b>polarity</b> at a potential (- 10 mV) more positive than the GABA-activated current.

40|$|SummaryThe {{formation}} of epithelial tissues containing lumens requires {{not only the}} apical-basolateral polarization of cells, but also the coordinated orientation of this polarity such that the apical surfaces of neighboring cells all point toward the central lumen. Defects in extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling lead to <b>inverted</b> <b>polarity</b> so that the apical surfaces face the surrounding ECM. We report a molecular switch mechanism controlling polarity orientation. ECM signals through a β 1 -integrin/FAK/p 190 RhoGAP complex to downregulate a RhoA/ROCK/Ezrin pathway at the ECM interface. PKCβII phosphorylates the apical identity-promoting Podocalyxin/NHERF 1 /Ezrin complex, removing Podocalyxin from the ECM-abutting cell surface and initiating its transcytosis to an apical membrane initiation site for lumen formation. Inhibition of this switch mechanism results in the retention of Podocalyxin at the ECM interface and the development instead of collective front-rear polarization and motility. Thus, ECM-derived signals control the morphogenesis of epithelial tissues by controlling the collective orientation of epithelial polarization...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The amplitudes of {{radiated}} seismic waves contain {{far more}} information about earthquake source mechanisms than do first-motion polarities, but amplitudes are severely distorted by the effects of heterogeneity n the Earth. This distortion can be reduced greatly by using the ratios of amplitudes of appropriately chosen seismic phases, rather than simple amplitudes, but existing methods for inverting amplitude ratios are severely nonlinear and require computationally intensive searching methods to ensure that solutions are globally optimal. Searching methods are particularly costly if general (moment tensor) mechanisms are allowed. Efficient linear-program-ming methods, which do not suffer from these problems, have previously been ap-plied to <b>inverting</b> <b>polarities</b> and wave amplitudes. We extend these methods to am-plitude ratios, in which formulation on inequality constraint for an amplitude ratio takes the same mathematical form as a polarity observation.

Although {{there has been much}} recent progress in understanding the general polarizing machinery of epithelia, it is largely unclear how this machinery is controlled by the extracellular environment. To explore the signals from cell–matrix interactions that control orientation of cell polarity, we have used three-dimensional culture systems in which Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells form polarized, lumen-containing structures. We show that interaction of collagen I with apical � 1 -integrins after collagen overlay of a polarized MDCK monolayer induces activation of Rac 1, which is required for collagen overlay-induced tubulocyst formation. Cysts, comprised of a monolayer enclosing a central lumen, form after embedding single cells in collagen.

Neural responses to nonhomogeneous static and time-periodic inputs are analyzed in regimes close to and away from self-oscillation. Static stimuli can cause oscillatory behavior for certain asymmetry levels. Time-periodic stimuli expose dynamical differences between ON/OFF and ON/ON nets. Outside the stimulated region, we show that ON/OFF nets exhibit frequency doubling, while ON/ON nets cannot. On the other hand, ON/ON networks show antiphase responses between stimulated and unstimulated regions, an effect that does not rely on specific receptive field circuitry. An analysis of the resonance properties of both net types reveals that ON/OFF nets exhibit larger response amplitude. Numerical simulations of the neural field models agree with theoretical predictions for localized static and time-periodic forcing.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions recorded from the cochleas of neonates using three acquisition protocols: non-linear; linear; and QuickScreen. In the non-linear mode, a series of four clicks was used, with three clicks at the same level and polarity and a fourth at three times greater amplitude and <b>inverted</b> <b>polarity.</b> In the linear protocol, all stimuli were presented at the same level and polarity. Both modes used a 20 ms recording window, but the third QuickScreen screening mode used the non-linear click sequence and a shorter 12 ms window. MATERIALS and METHODS: All responses were processed off-line with time-frequency algorithms, with the linear transiently evoked otoacoustic emissions additionally processed to eliminate linear artifacts in the initial few milliseconds of signal. RESULTS: Short windows contained only a fraction of the transiently evoked otoacoustic emission, distorting its time-frequency structure. Analysis of the response level and signal to noise ratio suggested that recordings elicited by a linear protocol had an advantage in terms of signal to noise ratio. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that screening protocols that use recording windows with a reduced length, such as QuickScreen, can only be used to detect the presence or absence of otoacoustic emission. Removing the stimulus artifact from linear transiently evoked otoacoustic emission responses improves response level and signal to noise ratio compared with the standard non-linear protocol...|$|E
