5|$|<b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> is a clerkship vacant in your office, and I beg {{to apply}} for the same. I have passed the Matriculation Examination and studied up to the F.A. but was {{prevented}} from pursuing my studies further owing to several untoward circumstances. I have, however, been devoting all my time to Mathematics and developing the subject. I can say I am quite confident I can do justice to my work if I am appointed to the post. I therefore beg to request that you will be good enough to confer the appointment on me.|$|E

Individually, I {{was not ready to}} accept that {{responsibility}} quite yet. Going through the playoffs and having that experience has probably given me more confidence. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> {{is going to be a}} lot more responsibility on my shoulders with this, but it's something I'm ready for, I feel very comfortable with it and I'm just excited to get things going." ...|$|E
500|$|On 29 September 1939, {{soon after}} the start of the war, Godfrey {{circulated}} a memorandum that, [...] "bore all the hallmarks of... Lieutenant Commander Ian Fleming", according to historian Ben Macintyre. It was called the Trout Memo and compared the deception of an enemy in wartime to fly fishing. The memo contained a number of schemes to be considered for use against the Axis powers to lure U-boats and German surface ships towards minefields. Number 28 on the list was an idea to plant misleading papers on a corpse that would be found by the enemy; the suggestion is similar to Operation Mincemeat, the successful 1943 plan to conceal the intended invasion of Italy from North Africa, although that idea was developed by Charles Cholmondoley in October 1942. The recommendation in the Trout Memo was titled: [...] "A Suggestion (not a very nice one)", and continued: [...] "The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson: a corpse dressed as an airman, with despatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, {{it would have to be}} a fresh one." ...|$|E
2500|$|AbramoviÄ‡ later commented {{upon this}} experience: [...] "I {{was very angry}} because <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>there</b> is a {{physical}} limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform." ...|$|R
6000|$|INSPECTOR. In my experience, you {{can never}} have too much of that. [To WINSOR] <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there's</b> a lady in the room on this side [pointing Left] and a gentleman on this [pointing Right] Were they in their rooms? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You and {{the lady}} have this scene together, <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>I</b> suppose <b>there's</b> no use asking you {{which one of you}} queers it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But of that birth-place, <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> is now no doubt?" [...] said Eve, {{with more}} {{interest}} {{than she was}} herself conscious of betraying.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Sewell, whose astonishment was evident, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>There</b> can {{scarcely}} be many girls {{capable of doing}} what you have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Interesting or not," [...] Quest observed, [...] "I'd like to {{know whether}} it was Craig or not. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> were about a dozen unrecognisable bodies found." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just {{the post}} of under-turnkey, for <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there's</b> a vacancy," [...] said the prisoner; [...] "I wadna think of asking the lockman's* place ower his head; it wadna suit me sae weel as ither folk, for I never could put a beast out o' the way, much less deal wi' a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It matters little {{whether we}} can succeed or not, the attempt must be made," [...] Archie said promptly, and <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>there</b> was in his mind the thought that now had come {{the time when he}} might be able to show his {{willingness}} to aid a comrade, even as we had shown ours in his behalf.|$|R
60|$|In this emergency, as <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> it, <b>there</b> was but {{one course}} to follow. I refused {{to receive the}} challenge.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not mistaken, my dear Mademoiselle Viefville, {{and great}} {{preparations}} {{are made to}} do it honour. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> {{is to be a}} military parade, an oration, a dinner, and fire-works." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> is {{considerable}} {{trouble with the}} slaves in Missouri. Please do your best to keep peace on the question {{for two or three}} weeks, by which time we hope to do something here toward settling the question in Missouri.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I deny it as publicly. I can't say {{anything}} about the letter except that I am sure Mr Melmotte did not put your name to it. From what <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> seems to have been some blunder between your father and his lawyer.' ...|$|E
60|$|PHOEBE (desperate). <b>I</b> <b>understand,</b> sir, <b>there</b> is {{a belief}} that I keep Livvy in {{confinement}} because of your passion for her.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will get}} one of these houses!" [...] Father vowed. [...] "I thought you'd like them. I swear, I'll cut out my smoking, if necessary. Say! Got another idea! I wonder if we couldn't make up some excuse and butt into the {{bungalow}} that's been rented, and see how it looks furnished. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there's</b> some new-comers living there. We'll sort of make them a neighborly call." ...|$|R
60|$|Hearing my {{footsteps}} {{he looked}} up with a smile of pleasure and of welcome, and <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> <b>there</b> was naught to hinder my entering, therefore flung the door boldly open and walked in to find myself in the embrace of the old man, who petted and fondled me as if I had been down into the very jaws of death, and was come back only through my own brave exertions.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{excessively}} regret poor Gay,' said Carker, 'and the crew. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> {{were some}} of our very best men among 'em. It always happens so. Many men with families too. A comfort to reflect that poor Gay had no family, Captain Cuttle!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{for that}} reason," [...] I remarked, [...] "he is {{well out of}} the way! <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>There</b> is one more question, Louis, {{and it is one}} which you must answer me truthfully. You can imagine what it is when I tell you that it {{concerns}} mademoiselle!" ...|$|E
60|$|Well, said I, {{and is it}} not a great pity {{that all}} this part of the country, and in such a climate as this is, should lie uncultivated, or {{uninhabited}} rather? for <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> are not any great numbers of people to be found among them.|$|E
6000|$|JOHN [heavily]. <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> [But <b>there</b> is {{one thing}} he cannot understand, which is, why VENABLES should be so sure {{that he is not}} to hedge.] ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Indeed, Sir Adrian, <b>I</b> <b>understood</b> that <b>there</b> {{was a young}} lady, Miss Aurelia, that Master Merrifield was lamenting, {{as if she had}} {{met with}} a watery grave." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! <b>I</b> <b>understand.</b> <b>There</b> {{are greater}} attractions! Go on, child. Mayhap {{it may be}} your own wedding gown you are working at, if you finish it in time! Heavens! what great {{wondering}} eyes the child has! All in good time, my dear. I must talk to your father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have not}} heard from Ernest Clay, which I think very odd. If you write to him, mention this, {{and tell him to}} send me word how Dormer Stanhope behaves at mess. <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> has been a melee, not much; merely a rouette; do get it all out of him.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{this affair}} of honour <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> has been from first to last always {{something}} {{that no one in}} the army could quite make out," [...] declared the chasseur with the imperfect nose.

6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} for poor Lady St Julians," [...] said Lady Bardolf to Lady de Mowbray. [...] "It must {{be such a}} disappointment, and she has had so many; but <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> <b>there</b> is nobody to blame but herself.

6000|$|... "It is on {{the whole}} {{fortunate}} my nerves are reasonably good," [...] she said. [...] "It would be singularly inconvenient if Charley's whisky-smuggling friends should visit us to-night.

6000|$|... "I {{knew you}} would say so. If <b>I</b> <b>understand</b> rightly <b>there</b> is {{something}} like a jealousy of her case in the Merrifields, prompted greatly by their wish to expiate any neglect of her father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, that <b>I</b> don't <b>understand.</b> <b>There's</b> {{no getting}} {{it out of}} you. And I'll not ask you ever any more--never more--to say out of the deep reality of your heart what you loved me for.' ...|$|R
