For 2009 Okubo remained in the GP125 class but joined the 18 Garage Racing Team once again on a Honda. 2009 saw a significant improvement from 2008, with sixth overall in the championship; his best result in 2009 was sixth position at Okayama. Okubo once again rode with the 18 Garage Racing Team aboard a Honda in 2010, staying in the newly renamed J-GP3 class. Okubo opened the season with his first victory in the Japanese championship at Tsukuba, {{this was followed by}} another victory at Motegi, these victories along with two other podiums were enough to secure his first Japanese championship title. Okubo also competed in his first 125cc World Championship event as a wildcard at the <b>Japanese</b> <b>round</b> at Motegi, he qualified in 26th and finished the race just out of the points in 16th position. Deciding to try to defend his title in 2011, Okubo stayed in the J-GP3 class, along with 18 Garage Racing Team for the third consecutive year. Okubo only finished two of the five races, as he could only finish tenth overall. He once again received a wildcard entry to the 125cc World Championship for the <b>Japanese</b> <b>round</b> held at Motegi, he qualified 25th and finished just outside the points again in 17th.|$|R

Though no explanation was given for the change, it was seen as some form of revenge after the refusal of the Japanese manufacturers to back the 2004 rules. The Canadian round was eventually canceled after a circuit inspection determined {{that the amount of}} work necessary to bring the venue up to WSBK standard could not be carried out in time for the proposed date.|$|R

50|$|After {{observing the}} {{effectiveness}} of the Type 30 6.5×50mm round used against them during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-1905, leading Russian arms designers chambered early Russian semi-automatic rifle designs for the <b>Japanese</b> <b>round.</b> Since the standard Russian military rifle cartridge of the time, the 7.62×54mmR rimmed round, was too powerful and generated excessive recoil in an automatic weapon a 6.5 mm round was seen as more appropriate. Early designs by Vladimir Fedorov utilized 6.5×50 mm, including the Fedorov Avtomat rifle which was issued to troops, though in small numbers. Later, Russian troops on the Armenian front were issued with Type 38 carbines by the Tsar's government. Russians also tended to modify the Type 38's magazine latch, as it was found that gloved hands would sometimes inadvertently nudge the magazine release and dump the ammunition.|$|R

On 30 December 1943, during the Japanese occupation, Bose, who was allied with the Japanese, first raised the flag of Indian independence. General Loganathan, of the Indian National Army, was Governor of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, which had been annexed to the Provisional Government.

Further minor variations exist where European or <b>Japanese</b> manufacturers <b>round</b> a U measurement up or down to some closer convenient metric equivalent; for example the common 5U modules are exactly 8.75" [...] (222.25mm), but non-American manufacturers may prefer 220mm or 230mm.|$|R
500|$|Chang {{responded to}} Charles Burress's {{criticism}} {{in a letter}} written to the San Francisco Chronicle, but the letter was not published by the newspaper. [...] In the letter, she offered criticism of her own concerning Burress's article. Chang found a [...] "disturbing tendency" [...] by Burress to quote right-wing Japanese critics [...] "without demanding evidence to back up their allegations". She argued that Ikuhiko Hata, a source cited by Burress, was not [...] "regarded as a serious scholar" [...] in either Japan or in the U. S., {{because he was a}} regular contributor to [...] "ultra right-wing" [...] Japanese publications. One such publication had published an article from a Holocaust denier that argued that no gas chambers were used in Germany to kill Jews. This caused the parent publisher to shut down the publication. On Burress's criticism of her inaccurate photo captioning, Chang disputed the contention that the caption was wrong. She wrote that her book dealt with the [...] "horror of the Japanese invasion of China", and that the caption reading [...] "The <b>Japanese</b> <b>rounded</b> up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution" [...] contained two statements of indisputable fact.|$|R
500|$|San Francisco Chronicle {{staff writer}} Charles Burress wrote that Chang's quote {{of a secret}} {{telegram}} sent by Japan's foreign minister in 1938 was incorrectly cited as [...] "compelling evidence" [...] that Japanese troops killed at least 300,000 Chinese civilians in Nanjing. According to Burress, the figure of 300,000 Chinese civilians killed actually came from a message sent by a British reporter, concerning deaths not only in Nanjing but in other places as well. Additionally, Burress questioned Chang's motivation for writing the book - whether she wrote it as an activist or as a historian, stating that the book [...] "draws its emotional impetus" [...] from her conviction to not let the Nanking Massacre be forgotten by the world. [...] Burress also cited Ikuhiko Hata, a Japanese history professor at Nihon University, who argued that 11 photos in the book were misrepresented or fake. One particular photo shows women and children walking across a bridge with Japanese soldiers, and captioned as [...] "The <b>Japanese</b> <b>rounded</b> up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution." [...] Hata stated that the photo originally appeared in 1937 in a Japanese newspaper {{as part of a}} series of photos that showed peaceful scenes of Chinese villagers under Japanese occupation.|$|R

Overall, the unit was under the command of Captain Ohishi Kaname, though Lieutenant Commander Yoshitake Uesugi skippered Ushio and Lieutenant Commander Hiroshi Uwa skippered the other destroyer. The engagement began at 09:31 and lasted 54 minutes. The American command, communications and power plant building was damaged by a 5 in shell, which deflected off an adjacent laundromat. Battery [...] "H" [...] commander—First Lieutenant George H. Cannon—was hit by shrapnel in the pelvis while inside the command building. By this time, the communications were down from enemy fire, so Lieutenant Cannon refused medical attention until he was assured that the communications were restored to the post and the wounded marines around him were evacuated.By the time Cannon received aid from a medic, it was too late; he perished due to blood loss. For Cannon's [...] "distinguished conduct in the line of his profession, extraordinary courage, and disregard of his own condition", he received the first Medal of Honor issued to a U.S. Marine for actions in the Second World War. A street on Sand Island was named after Cannon and continues to be known by that name, a 1943 destroyer escort——was also named after him. Six <b>Japanese</b> <b>rounds</b> struck and entered the main PBY Catalina hangar and destroyed a PBY inside; the Pilot and Fireman were killed (see next paragraph), while other civilians inside survived without injury.
