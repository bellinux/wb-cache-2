40|$|The {{automated}} {{identification of}} <b>network</b> <b>service</b> depen-dencies remains a challenging {{problem in the}} administra-tion of large distributed systems. Advances in developing solutions for this problem have immediate and tangible benefits to operators in the field. When the dependencies of the <b>services</b> in a <b>network</b> are better-understood, plan-ning for and responding to system failures becomes more efficient, minimizing downtime and managing resources more effectively. This paper introduces three novel techniques {{to assist in the}} automatic identification of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> depen-dencies through passively monitoring and analyzing net-work traffic, including a logarithm-based ranking scheme aimed at more accurate detection of <b>network</b> <b>service</b> de-pendencies with lower false positives, an inference tech-nique for identifying the dependencies involving infre-quently used <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> and an approach for au-tomated discovery of clusters of <b>network</b> <b>services</b> config-ured for load balancing or backup purposes.

40|$|This paper aims at {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution through a closer examination of the context of mobile handsets. It aims first to establish quantitatively that mobile handsets are a determinant of mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution patterns, and second, to develop a consistent perspective capable of explaining the evolution of various mobile <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> Despite the fact that mobile handsets are indispensable to users of mobile <b>network</b> <b>services,</b> surprisingly little is known about the role of these handsets in mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution. This paper provides quantitative evidence of a positive relationship between intra-network-carrier penetration rates for mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> subscribers and mobile handsets designed for these services. The relationship is such that if one <b>network</b> <b>service</b> is diffused more than another, the mobile handsets related to the more diffused service are similarly more widely diffused in the market, and vice versa. The evidence is derived from an analysis of two mobile <b>network</b> <b>services</b> in Japan, mobile Internet and third generation mobile, initiated by NTT DoCoMo and KDDI. There are no existing studies that consistently explain the mechanisms of different mobile <b>network</b> <b>service</b> evolution patterns. Since the positive relationship that emerges from the analysis is consistent for both cases, by examining the mechanisms underlying this relationship, the paper develops an adequate and consistent perspective based on a constituent model reflecting the technological and competition structure of mobile <b>network</b> <b>services.</b> From this perspective, this positive relationship can be explained as the similarity or dissimilarity in essential technology ownership distribution across constituents. This perspective describes mobile network evolution in terms of changes in the distribution of essential technology ownership and, therefore, could be generalised more widely.
