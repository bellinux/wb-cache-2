5|$|Most early {{theories}} of gamma-ray bursts posited nearby sources within the Milky Way Galaxy. From 1991, the Compton <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Observatory</b> (CGRO) and its Burst and Transient Source Explorer (BATSE) instrument, an extremely sensitive gamma-ray detector, provided data {{that showed the}} distribution of GRBs is isotropic—not biased towards any particular direction in space. If the sources were from within our own galaxy they would be strongly concentrated {{in or near the}} galactic plane. The absence of any such pattern in the case of GRBs provided strong evidence that gamma-ray bursts must come from beyond the Milky Way. However, some Milky Way models are still consistent with an isotropic distribution.|$|E

As of late 2010, the preferred plan is to use a slightly modified Progress spacecraft to de-orbit the ISS. This plan was seen as the simplest, cheapest and with the highest margin. Skylab, the only space station built and launched entirely by the US, decayed from orbit slowly over 5 years, and no attempt was made to de-orbit it using a deorbital burn.

25|$|Gamma {{rays are}} absorbed {{high in the}} Earth's {{atmosphere}} so most gamma-ray astronomy is conducted with satellites. Gamma-ray telescopes use scintillation counters, spark chambers and more recently, solid-state detectors. The angular resolution of these devices is typically very poor. There were balloon-borne experiments in the early 1960s, but gamma-ray astronomy really began with {{the launch of the}} OSO 3 satellite in 1967; the first dedicated gamma-ray satellites were SAS B (1972) and Cos B (1975). The Compton <b>Gamma</b> <b>Ray</b> <b>Observatory</b> (1991) was a big improvement on previous surveys. Very high-energy gamma-rays (above 200GeV) can be detected from the ground via the Cerenkov radiation produced by the passage of the gamma-rays in the Earth's atmosphere. Several Cerenkov imaging telescopes have been built around the world including: the HEGRA (1987), STACEE (2001), HESS (2003), and MAGIC (2004).|$|E

40|$|Clusters {{of galaxies}} are {{revealing}} themselves as powerful sources of non thermal radiation {{in a wide}} range of wavelengths. In order to account for these multifrequency observations equipartition of cosmic rays (CRs) with the thermal gas in clusters of galaxies is often invoked. This condition might suggest a dynamical role played by cosmic rays in the virialization of these large scale structures and is now testable through <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> observations. We show here, in the specific case of the Coma and Virgo clusters, for which upper limits on the <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> emission exist, that equipartition implies <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> fluxes that are close or even in excess of the EGRET limit, depending on the adopted model of CR injection. We use this bound to limit the validity of the equipartition condition.

40|$|We {{report a}} planned search {{technique}} for Gamma-Ray Bursts {{too weak to}} trigger the on-board threshold. The technique is to search residuals from a physically based background model used for analysis of point sources by the Earth occultation method. Searching residuals (as opposed to raw data) minimizes false triggers from occultation edges and many other effects which lead to rapid variation in the raw count rate, The background model is based on physical parameters, such as charged particle count rates and atmospheric secondaries. This allows fitting to long periods (e. g., several orbits), which in turn increases search effectiveness for bursts of longer duration. Initial results and expectations are presented.

40|$|Scenarios with gravitino {{dark matter}} face {{potential}} cosmological problems {{induced by the}} presence of the Next-to-Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (NLSP) at the time of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN). A very simple, albeit radical, solution to avoid all these problems consists on assuming that R-parity is slightly violated, since in this case the NLSP decays well before the onset of BBN. Remarkably, even if the gravitino is no longer stable in this scenario, it still constitutes a very promising dark matter candidate. In this talk we review the motivations for this scenario and we present a model that naturally generates R-parity breaking parameters of the right size to produce a consistent thermal history of the Universe, while satisfying at the same time all the laboratory and cosmological bounds on R-parity breaking. We also discuss possible signatures of this scenario at <b>gamma</b> <b>ray</b> <b>observatories</b> and at colliders. Comment: Submitted for the SUSY 07 proceedings. 4 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
