5|$|The {{clinical}} {{state of}} DKA is associated, {{in addition to}} the above, with the release of various counterregulatory hormones such as glucagon and adrenaline as well as cytokines, the latter of which leads to increased markers of inflammation, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of infection.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> {{of close}} contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity {{have the potential}} to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over decades or even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
5|$|Most ZnO has n-type character, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of {{intentional}} doping. Nonstoichiometry {{is typically}} {{the origin of}} n-type character, but the subject remains controversial. An alternative explanation has been proposed, based on theoretical calculations, that unintentional substitutional hydrogen impurities are responsible. Controllable n-type doping is easily achieved by substituting Zn with group-III elements such as Al, Ga, In or by substituting oxygen with group-VII elements chlorine or iodine.|$|E

50|$|Adaptation {{measures}} in Jordan include {{a wide range}} of activities targeting water scarcity.

5|$|After hatching, {{the larvae}} spend another 72 hours absorb their yolk sacs and {{developing}} their fins {{before they become}} free-swimming fry. The fry forage during daylight in a dense school {{and return to the}} cave or crevice for the night. Like other cichlids, the parents retrieve their young just before dark, sucking up three or four at a time and delivering them into the nest. The parents anticipate night, using a sense of time; in laboratory experiments convict cichlids continued to retrieve young as night approached <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of any signal, such as dimming light. During the night, the fry bunch up {{at the bottom of the}} cave or nest, where the parents fan them.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is heterozygote advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
5|$|An attack often {{begins with}} muscle pain, cramping, and stiffness. This is {{followed}} by weakness or paralysis that tends to develop rapidly, usually in late evening or {{the early hours of}} the morning. The weakness is usually symmetrical; the limb muscles closer to the trunk (proximal) are predominantly affected, and weakness tends to start in the legs and spread to the arms. Muscles of the mouth and throat, eyes, and breathing are usually not affected, but occasionally weakness of the respiratory muscles can cause life-threatening respiratory failure. Attacks typically resolve within several hours to several days, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of treatment. On neurological examination during an attack, flaccid weakness of the limbs is noted; reflexes are usually diminished, but the sensory system is unaffected. Mental status is not affected.|$|E
40|$|The {{well-known}} {{inverse relationship}} between farm-size and productivity is usually {{explained in terms of}} diminishing returns with respect to land and other inputs coupled with various types of market frictions that prevent the efficient allocation of land across farms.

5|$|Despite {{the above}} formulations, most silver {{compounds}} have significant covalent character {{due to the}} small size and high first ionization energy (730.8kJ/mol) of silver. Furthermore, silver's Pauling electronegativity of 1.93 is {{higher than that of}} lead (1.87), and its electron affinity of 125.6kJ/mol is much higher than that of hydrogen (72.8kJ/mol) and not much less than that of oxygen (141.0kJ/mol). Due to its full d-subshell, silver in its main +1 oxidation state exhibits relatively few properties of the transition metals proper from groups 4 to 10, forming rather unstable organometallic compounds, forming linear complexes showing very low coordination numbers like 2, and forming an amphoteric oxide as well as Zintl phases like the post-transition metals. Unlike the preceding transition metals, the +1 oxidation state of silver is stable <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of π-acceptor ligands.|$|E
5|$|<b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of an impact, {{significant}} acceleration or deceleration of {{the head}} can cause TBI; however in most cases a combination of impact and acceleration is probably to blame. Forces involving the head striking or being struck by something, termed contact or impact loading, are the cause of most focal injuries, and movement of the brain within the skull, termed noncontact or inertial loading, usually causes diffuse injuries. The violent shaking of an infant that causes shaken baby syndrome commonly manifests as diffuse injury. In impact loading, the force sends shock waves through the skull and brain, resulting in tissue damage. Shock waves caused by penetrating injuries can also destroy tissue along {{the path of a}} projectile, compounding the damage caused by the missile itself.|$|E
5|$|Hematinic {{deficiencies}} (vitamin B12, {{folic acid}} and iron), occurring singly or in combination, and {{with or without}} any underlying gastrointestinal disease, may be twice as common in people with RAS. However, iron and vitamin supplements only infrequently improve the ulceration. The relationship to vitamin B12 deficiency {{has been the subject}} of many studies. Although these studies found that 0–42% of those with recurrent ulcers suffer from vitamin B12 deficiency, an association with deficiency is rare. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of deficiency, vitamin B12 supplementation may be helpful due to unclear mechanisms. Hematinic deficiencies can cause anemia, which is also associated with aphthous-like ulceration.|$|E

5|$|Since {{antiviral}} {{drugs are}} effective in treating influenza if given early (see treatment section, below), it can be important to identify cases early. Of the symptoms listed above, the combinations of fever with cough, sore throat and/or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy. Two decision analysis studies suggest that during local outbreaks of influenza, the prevalence will be over 70%, and thus patients {{with any of these}} combinations of symptoms may be treated with neuraminidase inhibitors without testing. <b>Even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of a local outbreak, treatment may be justified in the elderly during the influenza season as long as the prevalence is over 15%.|$|E
5|$|Purkinje cells {{form the}} heart of the {{cerebellar}} circuit, and their large size and distinctive activity patterns have made it relatively easy to study their response patterns in behaving animals using extracellular recording techniques. Purkinje cells normally emit action potentials at a high rate <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of the synaptic input. In awake, behaving animals, mean rates averaging around 40Hz are typical. The spike trains show a mixture of what are called simple and complex spikes. A simple spike is a single action potential followed by a refractory period of about 10ms; a complex spike is a stereotyped sequence of action potentials with very short inter-spike intervals and declining amplitudes. Physiological studies have shown that complex spikes (which occur at baseline rates around 1Hz and never at rates much higher than 10Hz) are reliably associated with climbing fiber activation, while simple spikes are produced by a combination of baseline activity and parallel fiber input. Complex spikes are often followed by a pause of several hundred milliseconds during which simple spike activity is suppressed.|$|E

40|$|Long-ranged attractions across water {{between two}} {{surfaces}} that are randomly covered with (mobile) {{positive and negative}} charge domains {{have been attributed to}} induced correlation of the charges (positive lining up with negative) as the surfaces approach.

5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to be presented to the female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> of urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E

40|$|Interactions in aqueous media between uniformly charged {{surfaces}} are well understood, but most real {{surfaces are}} heterogeneous and disordered.

50|$|It is {{instructive}} {{to note that}} the slope of the bicarbonate line will never actually reach zero (i.e. will never be horizontal) under equilibrium conditions, <b>even</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complete <b>absence</b> of non-bicarbonate buffers. This is because the production of protons resulting from an increase in PCO2 is concomitant with the production of bicarbonate ions, as mentioned previously. Thus, a decrease in pH resulting from increased PCO2 must always occur with some minimal increase in bicarbonate concentration. Likewise, an increase in pH for similar reasons must occur with some minimal decrease in bicarbonate concentration.|$|R
