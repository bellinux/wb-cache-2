5|$|At one point, Disney had {{approached}} Cyan Worlds about constructing {{a theme park}} inspired by Myst, which included scouting an island area within Disney's Florida properties that Rand Miller <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> perfect for the Myst setting.

5|$|An initial {{pressing}} of 1,000 {{copies of}} the mixtape was produced and given to M.I.A.'s record label. The label began sending the copies out as promotional recordings, prompting Diplo {{to ask for the}} remaining copies to be returned so that he could distribute them at shows and in clubs, which he <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> a more appropriate method of distribution for the mixtape. He stated that around 2,000 {{copies of the}} recording were produced in total.|$|E
5|$|British Open Championship Golf was {{the third}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was directed by Rex Bradford, designer of the early golf title Mean 18. The team sought to create an accurate simulation of tournament golf play, which they <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> missing in the genre. To achieve this goal, they focused on recreating the atmosphere of a tournament, and included reactive crowds and announcers. The game was placed in competition with popular golf series such as Links and PGA Tour.|$|E
5|$|Como's final Christmas special {{was filmed}} in January 1994 in Dublin's Point Theatre before an {{audience}} of 4,500 people, including Irish President Mary Robinson and Como's friend, the actress Maureen O'Hara. Perry Como's Irish Christmas was a Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) production, made by an Irish independent production company in association with RTÉ. Como, appearing aged and unwell, had the flu during the show which took four hours to record. At the show's conclusion, Como apologized to his Dublin audience for a performance he <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> not up to his usual standards.|$|E

5000|$|Roofing <b>felts</b> <b>are</b> {{usually a}} 'paper' or fiber {{material}} impregnated in bitumen.

5|$|Edward Felt dialed 9-1-1 {{from his}} cell phone from the rear {{lavatory}} of the aircraft seeking information at 09:58. His call was answered by dispatcher John Shaw, and <b>Felt</b> <b>was</b> able {{to tell him about}} the hijacking before the call was disconnected. Multiple news reports (originally based on a 9-1-1 supervisor's account after having overheard the call) asserted that Edward Felt reported hearing an explosion and seeing smoke from an undetermined location on the plane. These reports were not corroborated by Shaw or Felt's wife, Sandra, who listened to the recording afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Frustrated {{by what he}} <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> {{too much}} individualism in the game, Schriner {{contemplated}} retiring from professional hockey in favour of taking up a coaching position in Alberta's senior league. He {{had a change of}} heart and returned to the Leafs for the 1942–43 NHL season. Schriner again announced his intention to leave the game in June 1943, this time citing past injuries to his knee and dissatisfaction with Leafs' owner Conn Smythe's contract offer for the following season.|$|E
5|$|Gary Steinman of Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine {{said that}} the lack of a plotline gave the player no {{incentive}} to keep playing through what he <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> a poor combat system. Both of those criticisms were repeated by Electronic Gaming Monthlys Sam Kennedy in his review. RPGamer's Bilyk felt that the smaller plots, while sometimes simplistic and not focused on the player, were enjoyable experiences. IGN's Smith concluded that while he enjoyed the game, he felt {{that it was not a}} complete game like Secret of Mana, but instead a collection of fun experiences.|$|E

5|$|I {{had a lot}} of {{theories}} I was working with when I did the Poe films...One of my theories was that these stories were created out of the unconscious mind of Poe, and the unconscious mind never really sees reality, so until The Tomb of Ligeia. we never showed the real world. In Pit, John Kerr arrived in a carriage against an ocean background, which I <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> more representative of the unconscious. That horseback interlude was thrown out because I didn't want to have a scene with people out in broad daylight.|$|E
5|$|Jack Brabham used BT19 {{again at}} the Italian Grand Prix at Monza, another high speed circuit. A second BT20 was {{completed}} at the Italian track and Brabham tried it in practice for the race, but decided to race his Old Nail, which he <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> fitted with a stronger engine. As at Reims, Brabham successfully slipstreamed the race leaders early on, but an oil leakage stopped the car after 8 laps. Neither Surtees nor Stewart finished the race and Brabham clinched his third world championship.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{played only}} three {{seasons with the}} 49ers. Like Tittle, Johnson had a late-blooming career; his most {{productive}} years came with the Pittsburgh Steelers, well after his time in San Francisco. He remains the oldest player to rush for 1,000 yards in a single season, when he did so in 1964 at age 35. He retired in 1966 with the third most career rushing yards in the NFL. Johnson's induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame came in 1987, and was an honor that contemporaries <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> fifteen years overdue.|$|E
5000|$|Many musical {{instruments}} use <b>felt.</b> It <b>is</b> {{often used as}} a damper. On drum cymbal stands, it protects the cymbal from cracking and ensures a clean sound. It is used to wrap bass drum strikers and timpani mallets. <b>Felt</b> <b>is</b> used extensively in pianos; for example, piano hammers are made of wool felt around a wooden core. The density and springiness of the <b>felt</b> <b>is</b> {{a major part of}} what creates a piano's tone. As the felt becomes grooved and [...] "packed" [...] with use and age, the tone suffers. <b>Felt</b> <b>is</b> placed under the piano keys on accordions to control touch and key noise; it is also used on the pallets to silence notes not sounded by preventing air flow.|$|R

He competed at the 1979 U.S. National Championships at Fort Lauderdale, setting Australian {{records in the}} 100m and 200m backstroke in times of 56.50s and 2m 2.61s respectively. Over time, Kerry became increasingly discontented with Counsilman, who he <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> losing focus and becoming preoccupied with various business commitments and an attempt to swim across the English Channel. Kerry transferred to the University of Southern California, which was coached by Naber's mentor Peter Daland.|$|E
5|$|Misterioso was {{released}} in 1958 by Riverside Records to a mixed critical reaction; reviewers complimented Monk's performance but were critical of Griffin, whose playing they <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> out of place with the quartet. The album was remastered and reissued in 1989 and 2012 by Original Jazz Classics, and has since received retrospective acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed Griffin's playing as the record's highlight.|$|E

The Rootes factory at Ryton did not have the capacity to build the Tiger, so the company contracted the job to Jensen in West Bromwich. Any disappointment Shelby may have <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> tempered by an offer from Rootes to pay him an undisclosed royalty on every Tiger built.|$|E
5|$|The Mercury Prize {{also has}} a {{reputation}} for being awarded to outside chances rather than the favourites.

The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death {{and did not}} cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some <b>felt</b> <b>was</b> contrary {{to the spirit of}} aikido.|$|E
