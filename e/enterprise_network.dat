40|$|Modern <b>enterprise</b> <b>networks</b> have complex topologies {{and impose}} {{a variety of}} {{restrictions}} on <b>network</b> communication. <b>Enterprise</b> <b>networks</b> also evolve with time due to software patches, worm outbreaks, network upgrades etc. These characteristics of enterprises generally tend to make their network configuration files highly complex. The high degree of configuration complexity makes <b>enterprise</b> <b>networks</b> error-prone, difficult to troubleshoot and difficult to modify. When problems arise or when the network’s configuration needs to change, operators are often forced to intervene manually. Since their time is at a premium, operators generally implement quick hacks, which further exacerbates the complexity. In particular, the quick-fixes make configurations of differen...|$|R

This leads to <b>enterprise</b> <b>networks</b> that are inflexible, fragile, and difficult to manage. To address these limitations, we offer SANE, a protection architecture for <b>enterprise</b> <b>networks.</b> SANE defines a single protection layer that governs all connectivity within the enterprise. All routing and access control decisions are made by a logically-centralized server that grants access to services by handing out capabilities (encrypted source routes) according to declarative access control policies (e. g., “Alice can acces...|$|R

40|$|The IPv 6 {{increased}} address pool presents {{changes in}} resource impact to the Enterprise that, if not adequately addressed, can change risks that are locally significant in IPv 4 to risks that can impact the Enterprise in its entirety. The expected {{conclusion is that}} the IPv 6 environment will impose {{significant changes in the}} Enterprise environment - which may negatively impact organisational security if the IPv 6 nuances are not adequately addressed. This thesis reviews the risks related to the operation of <b>enterprise</b> <b>networks</b> with the introduction of IPv 6.
