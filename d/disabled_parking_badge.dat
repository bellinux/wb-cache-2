Because he has a large debt {{that he wants to}} clear, Simon asks David to murder his aunt, who is Mr Jelly's assistant, the elderly Mrs Wren. In return, David asks that his mother doesn't suffer any more. David breaks into Sunnydale Assisted Living to kill Mrs. Wren, but finds what appears to be her dead body, he leaves, believing the job was done. He actually found another lady named Pat, murdered by Detective Finney, believing her to be Mrs Wren. David returns home to find Maureen dismembering Simon.

40|$|The {{abuse of}} <b>disabled</b> <b>parking</b> permit is growing {{during the last}} years and {{controlling}} the current system is too difficult. As the current <b>disabled</b> <b>parking</b> permit (blue <b>badge)</b> {{does not have any}} mechanism to recognize the blue badge holder, then anybody else could use it. Any chance for police or authorized officer to find someone who abuses the system are when they are leavening the car or when they are returning to the vehicle. The solution is a digital blue badge that is similar to the current blue badge but it is digital and it could recognized the blue badge holder with a finger print scanner that scan the finger print of the blue badge holder and it is necessary that the blue badge holder be in the vehicle when {{it is going to be}} activated and it also has a digital clock and a digital timer that shows how long the blue badge is activated...|$|R

50|$|The abuse and/or {{misuse of}} <b>disabled</b> <b>parking</b> permits has been {{identified}} as a major problem in the US, with some estimates indicating the majority seen on the street are used or obtained fraudulently.
