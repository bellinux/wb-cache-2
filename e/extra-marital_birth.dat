40|$|The main aim of {{the paper}} is to present {{the past and the}} present picture of the extra–marital {{fertility}} in Poland. Starting with 16 th century the evolution of numbers and frequencies of illegitimate births is described. Special attention is given to the 20 th century, especially to its last decade. The data from the current registration and from population censuses have been used for the analysis, as well the works of the Polish historians of the family. The author tries to verify thesis which could be useful in explanation of the phenomenon’s development and spatial differentiation. The basic thesis are: 1) 	The proportion of the <b>extra–marital</b> <b>births</b> is very differentiated in the specified regions of Poland. Reasons which could help to explain the diversity should be asked in the past. 2) 	The change of the proportions of the out–of–wedlock children have been related to changes in the age composition of women and their distribution by marital status. The most important findings of the work is the determination that around one third of the increase in the <b>extra–marital</b> <b>births</b> which occurred in period 1960 – 1995 can be attributed to shifts in the woman composition by marital status...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} to discuss what have caused South Korea’s {{reproductive}} crisis. We pointed outthat the causes of lowest low fertility syndrome in South Korea are disconformity between postindustrialization and fertility practices, conflicts between modernization and fertility behaviors, the unstable housing and the burden on old-age security, a strong resistance to <b>extra-marital</b> <b>births</b> and “informal” cohabitation. To recover the fertility rate to the replacement level, the pronatal policies need to increase investment, to foster culture and societal environments favorable for reproductive behaviors, and to harmonize societal systems with fertility practices...|$|R

25|$|In 1984, a law {{was passed}} to ensure that {{divorced}} women who were not in receipt of maintenance would be provided with assistance in recovering the shortfall in their income from their former husband. By 1986, particular attention was being focused on assisting women in single-parent families {{to get back into}} employment, in recognition of the growing problems associated with <b>extra-marital</b> <b>births</b> and marital breakdown. Parental leave was extended to firms with 100 employees in 1981 (previously, parental leave provision had been made in 1977 for firms employing at least 200 employees) and subsequently to all employees in 1984. From 1984 onwards, married women were obliged to sign tax returns, men and women were provided with equal rights in managing their common property and that of their children, and in 1985 they became responsible for each other’s debts.|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{regional}} {{variation in}} the past is important if we want to understand to what extent the European union is ‘converging’ in demographic terms. In order to chart and explain the regional variation of demographic phenomena, scholars often make use of typologies of ‘family systems’. Family systems have been evoked to explain intra-European differences in ages at marriage, celibacy rates, household size and composition, inheritance patterns et cetera. However, the variation in extramarital births (‘illegitimacy’) is rarely discussed or placed within these typologies. Is this because the phenomenon is more related to acute social problems and cultural changes than to the longue durée of family structures? Does illegitimacy form the limit of what family systems can explain? Or should we adjust our thinking on family systems to include ‘illegitimacy’? In this essay, regional variation in <b>extra-marital</b> <b>births</b> in Europe around 1900 is explored from the family system perspective. The question is also addressed to what extent the current variation {{can be seen as a}} continuation of past patterns. The paper focuses on variation in national illegitimacy rates from 1900 - 2000. In 1900, the lowest rates of Europe were found in the Netherlands, and the highest in Romania. However, given the differences in the frequency of marriage among (young) women, one would have expected the reverse. Therefore, part of the analysis is devoted to a comparison between the backgrounds of illegitimacy in these two countries.

40|$|M. A. (Sociology) The {{increasing}} {{incidence of}} phenomena like cohabitation, <b>extra-marital</b> <b>births</b> and voluntary single parenthood in Western society, indicates {{a shift in}} the social definition of sexuality. This is particularly apparent when the current situation is compared to traditional Western societies where sexuality was, for instance, limited to the monogamous, heterosexual marriage and to reproduction within marriage. This change in the meaning of sexuality can be attributed to a change in attitudes towards the acceptability of premarital sexual and sexually-related behaviour. This attitude is referred to as premarital sexual permissiveness. This study investigates premarital sexual permissiveness among female university students as related to: (i) certain social factors namely mother-daughter communication about sexuality, religiosity, liberalism-conservatism and commitment to marital life and (ii) certain biographic factors namely age, area of study, academic study year, environment where the student grew up, home language, religious denomination, father's occupation, father's highest educational qualifications, mother's occupation, mother's highest educational qualification and the student's dating phase. In this study quantitative research was conducted in which a questionnaire was completed by a representative sample of 253 female students. The questionnaire consisted of questions on the biographical background of students as well as questions measuring premarital sexual permissiveness, mother-daughter communication about sexuality, religiosity, liberalism-conservatism and commitment to marital life. To measure the above-mentioned social factors, six scales were developed by means of factor analysis and item analysis. The scales are Premarital sexual permissiveness-with-affection, Premarital sexual permissiveness-without-affection, Mother-daughter communication about sexuality, Religiosity, Politicalliberalism-eonservatism and Commitment to marital life. Premarital sexual permissiveness-with-affection and Premarital sexual permissiveness-without-affection were analysed in terms of the biographic background of the student and the four other scales, making use of one-way analysis of variance and Scheffe's paired comparisons, Hotelling T 2 and t-tests and Pearsons correlations. It was found that fourth year/honours students are more in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-with-affection than second- or third year students. Students that are in love with somebody or are engaged, are also more in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-with-affection than unattached students. English-speaking students are more in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-with-affection and Premarital sexual permissiveness-without-affection than Afrikaans-speaking students. It was also found that students from the Faculty of Science are more in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-without-affection than students from the Faculty of Arts. Regarding the interrelation between the different scales, {{it was found that the}} more students are in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-with-affection, the more they are in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-without-affection. Religiosity proved to be of significance in the sense that the more religious the students are, the less they are in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-with-affection and Premarital sexual permissiveness-without-affection. It was also found that the more often mother and daugther communicated about sexuality. the less the student would be in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-without-affection. With regard to Commitment to marital life as a dependant variable, it was found that the more students are in favour of Premarital sexual permissiveness-with-affection and Premarital sexual permissiveness-without-affection, the less they are committed to marital life. These findings pave the way for more research on premarital sexual permissiveness in South Africa, for example research on premarital sexual permissiveness among male students, among other races and among high school scholars...|$|R
