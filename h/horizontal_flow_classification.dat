In the vertical flow constructed wetland, the effluent moves vertically from the planted layer down through the substrate and out (requiring air pumps to aerate the bed). In the <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> CW the effluent moves horizontally via gravity, parallel to the surface, with no surface water thus avoiding mosquito breeding. Vertical flow CWs {{are considered to be}} more efficient with less area required compared to <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> CWs. However, they need to be interval-loaded and their design requires more know-how while <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> CWs can receive wastewater continuously and are easier to build.|$|R

40|$|In this work, {{we first}} briefly {{introduce}} {{the concept of}} IP <b>flow</b> <b>classification</b> on a general conceptual level. The intention is {{to rise above the}} technological details and create a conceptual point of view on <b>flow</b> <b>classification</b> and closely related issues. Then we move on to study and compare earlier <b>flow</b> <b>classification</b> methods such as the all and selected flow classifier and the packet count flow classifier. The comparison of these methods is done with actual network tra#c and various performance metrics are presented. It is found that while the traditional methods of <b>flow</b> <b>classification</b> are found to reduce the resource usage of the network elements, they provide the user with an ambiguous tra#c profile at the best. A measurement based learning approach to <b>flow</b> <b>classification</b> is then presented. We first introduce the list based <b>flow</b> <b>classification</b> algorithm to act as the reference point to the novel approach of using learning vector quantization in <b>flow</b> <b>classification.</b> It is found that both the list classifier and the learning vector quantization algorithm, when used in <b>flow</b> <b>classification,</b> require only moderate performance from the network elements while producing an intuitive and user-comprehensible tra#c profile being able to adapt to tra#c profile changes. The learning vector quantization flow classifier is more sensitive to changing network tra#c profiles and functions somewhat more accurately than the list classifier. While all measurement-based approaches su#er the delay of analyzing the measurement data our results indicate that measurement-based approach to <b>flow</b> <b>classification</b> is able to provide users more accurate service profiles in changing tra#c environment while stating reasonable performance demands to the network equipment...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{determine}} the radial {{component of the}} supergranular flow velocity by examining the center-to-limb variation of the Doppler velocity signal. We acquire individual Doppler images obtained with the MDI instrument on the SOHO spacecraft and process them to remove the p-mode oscillation signal, the axisymmetric flows, the convective blueshift signal, and instrumental artifacts. The remaining Doppler signal contains only non-axisymmetric flow structures. The Doppler signal from the <b>horizontal</b> <b>flows</b> in these structures varies like sin ρ, where ρ is the heliocentric angle from disk center. The Doppler signal from radial flows varies like cos ρ. We fit the center-to-limb variation of the mean squared velocity signal to a straight line in sin 2 ρ over the central portion of the disk. The intercept of this line at disk center gives the amplitude of the radial component of the flow. The slope of the line gives the amplitude of the horizontal component. We find that the radial flows for typical supergranules have speeds about 10 % that of their associated <b>horizontal</b> <b>flows</b> or about 30 m s− 1. The ratio of the radial to <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> speed increases from 9 % to about 18 % as {{the size of the}} structure decreases from> 60 Mm to ∼ 5 Mm. We use data simulations to check these results and find a ratio that increases from 5 % to only about 12 % over the same range of sizes. These smaller ratios are attributed to an underestimation of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> speeds {{due to the fact that}} the transverse component of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> is not detected by Doppler measurements. 1...|$|R

40|$|Papers {{presented}} to the 11 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 20 - 23 July 2015. In an earlier paper {{the results of a}} simulation of unstable flow phenomena in vertical condensing flows were presented. The <b>horizontal</b> condensing <b>flow</b> model was extended to include gravitational effects. The simulation of the non-linear model revealed existence of limit-cycle type of oscillations of large amplitude, including possibilities of flow reversals, as were observed on <b>horizontal</b> <b>flows.</b> The simulations also revealed that the gravitational effects have an attenuating effect on the oscillatory behavior in downward flows, and an enhancing effect on the upward flows. Matlab/Simulink tools were used for the system simulations. In the present paper the non-linear model was linearized, leading to an identification of the stable and unstable domains of operation for vertical condensing flows in both upward and downward flow directions. The stability boundary for the <b>horizontal</b> condensing <b>flows</b> lies in between the stability boundaries for vertical flows. The downward condensing flow is more stable and has a narrower unstable region than the <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow.</b> By comparison the vertical condensing upward flow is more unstable than both <b>horizontal</b> and downward <b>flows.</b> These observations are in correspondence with those of the non-linear model. A linear stability criterion including effects of gravity for vertical flows, that is an extension of such a criterion for <b>horizontal</b> <b>flows,</b> is presented. am 201...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the onset}} of {{convection}} in a horizontally partitioned porous layer is investigated. Two identical sublayers are separated by a thin impermeable barrier. There exists a background <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> {{in one of the}} layers or, equivalently, flows of half that strength in each sublayer but in opposite directions. A linearised stability analysis is performed where the horizontal component of the disturbance is factored into separate Fourier modes, leaving an ordinary differential eigenvalue problem for the critical Darcy-Rayleigh number {{as a function of the}} wavenumber. The dispersion relation is derived and the neutral stability curves are obtained for a wide range of <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> rates. The presence of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> alters the morphology of the neutral curves from that which occurs when there is no flow and travelling modes may arise.

The systems were {{used to compare the}} nitrification/denitrification efficiency in a tropical climate which has temperatures above an average of 25 °C throughout the year. The effluent from a biogas digester of pig farm wastewater with TKN and COD concentrations of approximately 400 and 1, 000 mg/L was fed every 4 hours intermittently. The effluent was recycled to the system with the ratio of 1 : 1 and the hydraulic loading rate was increased from 3 to 6 and 12 cm/d including recycled water. At higher hydraulic loading rates, nitrogen COD and BOD removal efficiencies were lower. The SS, TP and fecal coliform bacteria removal efficiencies were not clearly affected by the high hydraulic loading or the different layout of the system. Nitrogen uptake by plants was very low in relation to the nitrogen loading of the systems. In general, the removal efficiencies of both types were comparable but the system with a vertical <b>flow</b> over <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> sand bed is more suitable for sites with limited land area, although its construction can be more difficult than the system with <b>horizontal</b> <b>flow</b> followed by a vertical flow bed...|$|R

40|$|Studies {{reported}} in the past on critical heat flux (CHF) are mostly limited to vertical flow, large channel diameter, high pressure and high mass flux.
