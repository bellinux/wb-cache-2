5|$|The Pensacola Dam, {{also known}} as the Grand River Dam, is a multiple-arch {{buttress}} dam on the Grand River in-between Disney and Langley in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. The dam is operated by the Grand River Dam Authority and creates Grand Lake o' the Cherokees. After decades of vision and planning, it was constructed between 1938 and 1940 for the purposes of <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> generation, flood control and recreation. It is Oklahoma's first <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> plant and {{is referred to as the}} longest multiple-arch dam in the world.|$|E

5|$|The Shinano River system, {{particularly}} in its upper reaches (Chikuma River) {{and in the}} Sai basin, is used for <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> generation due to the steep gradient in its upper reaches and its high discharge producing, as a whole, 2,618 megawatts. While the construction of <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> stations began before World War II, it significantly increased following the war. These power plants, such as the Shimofanato Power Station and the 450,000 kilowatt JR East Shinano River Hydropower Station near Ojiya, supply Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|This trend {{continued}} {{and increases in}} the production of <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> are directly related to industrial development. In 2005, Landsvirkjun produced 7,143 GWh of electricity total of which 6,676 GWh or 93% was produced via <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> plants. Additionally 5,193 GWh or 72% was used for power-intensive industries like aluminum smelting. In 2009 Iceland built its biggest hydroelectric project to date, a 690 MW hydroelectric plant to provide energy for another aluminum smelter — the Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant. This project was opposed strongly by environmentalists.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, Japan's oldest <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> {{plant is}} located in the Shinano River system.

5|$|Pumped-storage {{hydroelectricity}} stores {{energy in}} the form of water pumped when energy is available from a lower elevation reservoir to a higher elevation one.

5|$|Russia {{is one of}} the world's largest {{producers}} of energy, most of which it obtains from oil, natural gas and coal. The country's focus on those resources for production and export, which constitute 80% of foreign trade earnings, means it has paid little attention to renewable energy. Out of the 203GW of electric generation capacity that Russia has, 44GW comes from hydroelectricity, 307MW from geothermal, 15MW from wind and negligible amounts from other renewable sources. In 2009, the Russian energy industry generated a total 992TWh of electricity, 176TWh of which was produced by <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> stations. Some of Russia's <b>hydroelectric</b> <b>power</b> plants are outdated and are in need of additional investment, as shown by the accident at the Sayano-Shushenskaya HPP in 2009.|$|E
