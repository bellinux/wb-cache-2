40|$|Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} forage crop in the Czech Republic used for production of fresh or preserved fodder. It is grown in pure stands and also in different types of mixtures whith other legumes and grasses. It provides symbiotic nitrogen fixation and helps to significantly increase production of forage eithout the need of high fertilizers use. Today there are placed high demands on new varieties of red clover which has to produce high yields of dry matter with good forage quality, obtain increased resistance to pest and diseases and have also improved persistence. Persistence and yield of varieties of red clover was tested during four growing seasons in the Forage research station in Vatín. In 2011 was sown 15 varieties of red clover and one wild ecotype in mixture with Timothy Grass (Phleum pratense L.) and meadow fescue (<b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> <b>Hudson).</b> Proportion of red clover was 70 % (14 kg of seeds. ha- 1), Timothy Grass 20 % (6 kg of seeds. ha- 1) and <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> <b>Hudson</b> 10 % (4 kg of seeds. ha- 1). In every harvest year three cuts were harvested per year from which samples to assess dry matter content were taken. The highest yield of dry fodder in the third production year (2014) was reached by diploid variety Dafila (16 t. ha- 1), this variety was followed by tetraploid variety Astur (15, 7 t. ha- 1), diploid varieties Milvus (15, 4 t. ha- 1), Lestris (13, 7 t. ha- 1) and Start (13, 5 t. ha- 1). Significantly lowest yield of forage was harvested at the diploid variety AberRuby (7, 4 t. ha- 1). Evaluation of persistence index revealed that the most persistent was Swiss tetraploid variety Astur, followed by diploid varieties Milvus, Dafila, Elara and Start.

The photosynthetic rate of both wheat and meadow fescue was 31 37 %higher in elevated carbon dioxide (eCO 2) than in ambient CO 2 (aCO 2) throughout the growing season. The enhancement in wheat photosynthesis in eCO 2 declined 10 13 days before yellow ripeness,at which point the rate of photosynthesis in both CO 2 treatments declined. The stomatal conductance of wheat and meadow fescue was 2336 % lower in eCO 2 than in aCO 2. The amount and activity of ribulose- 1, 5 -bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) in wheat were lower under conditions of eCO 2,except at elevated temperatures in 1993 {{when there was a}} clear yield increase. There was no clear change in the amount and activity of Rubisco in meadow fescue under eCO 2 at either elevated or ambient temperature. This suggests that adaptation to elevated CO 2 at biochemical level occurs only when there is insufficient sink for photosynthetic products.

Techniques with lower costs than conventional undersowing by separate drilling are often regarded as unreliable. Undersowing by drilling after sowing spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) was compared with broadcast sowing simultaneously with drilling barley. Various implements were coupled behind the combined drill in cases where seed was broadcast: a press-wheel attachment, a long-tined harrow and a cage roller. A fourth treatment did not include an implement coupled behind the drill. The undersown crop was sown as a seed mixture of 3 kg ha- 1 red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and 6 kg ha- 1 meadow fescue (<b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> <b>Hudson).</b> The numbers of plants and weeds and the plant height were measured five times during the growing season. Above-ground biomass of the undersown species was determined at barley harvest and in late autumn. Grain yield of spring barley was recorded. Drilling resulted in the highest yield of undersown crop when an early summer drought occurred, but broadcasting in combination with use of seed covering equipment led to the least variation in biomass production over the 4 years the experiment was conducted. The relative proportion of meadow fescue in the crop was low in three years, and lower when broadcast than when drilled. Barley grain yield was highest when the seed was broadcast and seed covering equipment was used. Use of a cage roller creased weed biomass, but press-wheels and a long-tined harrow did not.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to analyze yield {{variation}} of Dactylis glomerata and <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> varieties grown on organic and mineral soil. This paper has drawn on two field experiments set up and carried out between 2010 and 2013. The experiment was conducted in two experimental stations: one in the Research Centre for Cultivar Testing in Krzyżewo and the other in the Experimental Stations for Variety Testing in Uhinin. The experiment in Krzyżewo was set up on ploughed soil, with spring barley as a forecrop. In Uhnin the experimental plots were located on peat meadow. The experimental plots were sown with varieties of Dactylis glomerata : Niva, Tukan, Amila, Crown Royale and with varieties of Festuca prate nsis : Limosa, Pasja, Anturka, Amelka. The full exploitation of Dactylis glomerata varieties was due between 2012 and 2013, whereas for <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> it was due between 2011 and 2012. In the experimental plots with the varieties of Dactylis glomerata the grass was harvested six times a year and chemical analysis of the biomass was done taking dry matter only from five cuts. The varieties of <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> were harvested four times. Each year in the course of the experiment fresh and dry matter of each cut were weighed. The grass species and their varieties as well as the particular mowing and kind of soil where the grass was grown have an impact on the yield.

Androgenesis using amphidiploid cultivars of <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> Lolium multiflorum as parents, overcame earlier problems {{that gave rise to}} widespread plant sterility amongst androgenic Festulolium populations. Two <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> Lolium multiflorum (2 n= 4 x= 28) cultivars, Sulino and Felopa, were highly amenable to androgenesis and 10 % of plants, including some novel androgenic genotypes, had sufficient fertility to produce progeny and further generations. The genomes of amphidiploid cultivars, which represent the F 8 generation, were the result of considerable intergeneric chromosome recombination. Moreover, during cultivar development, natural and breeders' selection pressures had led to the assembly of gene combinations that conferred good growth characters and fertility with the removal of putative deleterious gene combinations. Over 80 % of the androgenic plants derived from the amphidiploid F. pratensis L. multiflorum (2 n= 4 x= 28) had 14 chromosomes and were likely to be dihaploids with a single genome of Lolium and of Festuca. In contrast, hybrids of F. pratensis L. multiflorum (2 n= 2 x= 14) found naturally are invariably sterile. Structural reorganization within the genomes of the androgenic Festulolium plants had restored fertility in genotypes expected to contain the haploid genome of Lolium and Festuca. This provided opportunities for their future incorporation in breeding programmes and the development of fertile diploid Lolium?Festuca hybrids.

Limited information is available on how plant-atmosphere ammonia exchange is related to species {{diversity in}} grasslands. We have here investigated grass species abundance and different foliar nitrogen pools in 4 -year-old intensively managed grassland. Apoplastic pH and NH 4 + concentrations of the 8 most abundant species (Lolium perenne, Phleum pratense, <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis,</b> Lolium multiflorum, Poa pratensis, Dactylis glomerata, Holcus lanatus, Bromus mollis) were used to calculate stomatal NH 3 compensation points.

The observed differences in apoplastic NH 4 + and pH resulted in a large span of predicted values for the stomatal NH 3 compensation point which ranged between 0. 20 and 6. 57 nmol mol− 1. Three species (Lolium perenne, <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> and Dactylis glomerata) had sufficiently high NH 3 compensation point and abundance {{to contribute to the}} bi-directional NH 3 fluxes recorded over the whole field. The other 5 grass species had NH 3 compensation points considerably below the atmospheric NH 3 concentration and were thus not likely to contribute to NH 3 emission but only to NH 3 uptake from the atmosphere. Evaluated across species, leaf bulk-tissue NH 4 + concentrations correlated well (r 2 = 0. 902) with stomatal NH 3 compensation points calculated {{on the basis of the}} apoplastic bioassay. This suggests that leaf tissue NH 4 + concentrations combined with data for the frequency distribution of the corresponding species can be used for predicting the NH 3 exchange potential of a mixed grass sward.

Susceptible (S) plants either contained no introgressed chromosome segment or a segment which was physically smaller than the segments in resistant plants. Using GISH the resistance locus could be physically mapped to the midpoint of a short arm. Segregation ratios of the progeny of BC 3 plants, when crossed as R S and R R, were in agreement with the hypothesis that the resistance was controlled by a single gene or very closely linked genes. No R plants were produced by crossing S S plants. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Variation {{for winter}} {{hardiness}} generated by androgenesis from <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> x Lolium multiflorum amphidiploid cultivars with different winter susceptibility. ? Euphytica, 142 (1 - 2), 65 - 73 Androgenic populations produced from three <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> ? Lolium multiflorum amphidiploid (2 n = 4 x = 28) cultivars show wide within population variation for winter hardiness. Populations comprising {{a total of}} 423 androgenic plants derived from 23 donor plants from 3 Polish F. pratensis ? L. multiflorum cultivars Felopa, Sulino, and Rakopan were studied over 3 years (1999 ? 2002) in a field experiment at Lopuszna, Poland (2008 E, 4928 N, altitude 568 m). The results indicate that despite differences in winter hardiness between the three amphidiploid cultivars, the mean winter hardiness of androgenic progeny from each cultivar was the same. Thus an androgenesis component in a plant breeding programme may {{provide an opportunity to}} recover winter hardy genotypes from high yielding cultivars that are themselves adapted poorly to stress conditions. Androgenesis also evoked variation in snow mould resistance. In this case, androgenic plants with the greatest snow mould resistance were recovered from the least winter hardy donor cultivars and plants. The results indicated the low importance of snow mould resistance as a component of winter hardiness under the field conditions used for these experiments. Peer reviewe...|$|R

Changes in cold {{tolerance}} and {{the mechanisms of}} acclimation of photosystem II to cold hardening generated by anther culture of <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> and Lolium multiflorum cultivars. ? New Phytologist, 162, (1), 105 - 114 ? Mechanisms of photosynthetic acclimation to cold were investigated on androgenic plants generated from <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis</b> ? Lolium multiflorum (4 x) cultivars Felopa and Sulino and on parental material. ? Photosynthetic acclimation and resistance to high-light induced inactivation of PSII at low temperature were studied using chlorophyll fluorescence techniques in relation to winter hardiness, frost resistance and cold acclimation in field and controlled conditions. ? In the field increased energy dissipation before winter through a lower maximum quantum yield of PSII was correlated with improved winter survival of these genotypes. In controlled conditions winter hardy plants were more resistant to cold-induced inactivation of PSII. During cold acclimation of winter hardy plants nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ) increased, except in one genotype where photochemical quenching increased. ? The use of androgenic lines revealed gene combinations that determined alternative photoinhibition avoidance mechanisms in the parental genome. Increased dissipation of light energy is an alternative process to the increased photosynthetic capacity reported previously {{to be the main}} mechanism of photosynthetic acclimation to cold in herbaceous Poaceae.

Sponsorship: BBSRC RAE 2008 Microsynteny with rice and comparative genetic mapping {{were used to}} identify candidate orthologous sequences to the rice Hd 1 (Se 1) gene in Lolium perenne and <b>Festuca</b> <b>pratensis.</b> A F. pratensis bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library was screened with a marker (S 2539) physically close to Hd 1 in rice to identify the equivalent genomic region in F. pratensis. The BAC sequence was used to identify and map the same region in L. perenne. Predicted protein sequences for L. perenne and F. pratensis Hd 1 candidates (LpHd 1 and FpHd 1) indicated they were CONSTANS-like zinc finger proteins with 61 ? 62 % sequence identity with rice Hd 1 and 72 % identity with barley HvCO 1. LpHd 1 and FpHd 1 were physically linked in their respective genomes (< 4 kb) to marker S 2539, which was mapped to L. perenne chromosome 7. The identified candidate orthologues of rice Hd 1 and barley HvCO 1 in L. perenne and F. pratensis map to chromosome 7, a region of the L. perenne genome which has a degree of conserved genetic synteny both with rice chromosome 6, which contains Hd 1, and barley chromosome 7 H, which contains HvCO 1.
