5|$|The Doctor {{discovers that}} the volcano {{is being used}} by the Pyroviles to convert the human race and conquer Earth. The Doctor realises the volcano will not erupt if the energy {{converter}} is running, and tells Donna that the volcanic eruption is a fixed point in time and must always happen. The Doctor and Donna get into an escape pod and together press a lever which overloads the converter and triggers the eruption, killing the Pyroviles and launching the pod clear of the blast. The Doctor and Donna run for the TARDIS and the Doctor coldly leaves Caecilius and his family cowering in their home using the TARDIS in order to not interfere too deeply with history. However, Donna tearfully begs him to go back and at least save one person, regardless of who it is. The Doctor finally relents and goes back for Caecilius and his family. He leaves them on a hill overlooking the destruction, and together with Donna slips out quietly as the family mourns Pompeii. The Doctor comments to Donna that she was right - he <b>does</b> <b>need</b> someone to stop him.|$|E

Note that although the precession and the tilt of Earth's axis (the obliquity of the ecliptic) are calculated from the same theory and thus, are related to each other, the two movements act independently of each other, moving in opposite directions.|$|E

500|$|After {{the failure}} of Kidnap and Luck, Khan {{received}} fewer film offers, until Karan Johar approached him for the lead role in I Hate Luv Storys (2010). Directed by Punit Malhotra, the romantic comedy saw him portray Jai Dhingra, a young Casanova who {{does not believe in}} the concept of love and romance. The film garnered mixed reviews from critics; Khan's performance was generally well received. Komal Nahta wrote, [...] "Imran Khan is endearing and does well for {{a good part of the}} film. But he <b>does</b> <b>need</b> to improve in emotional scenes. [...] is free and lovable in the light scenes. I Hate Luv Storys was a domestic and international box-office success, earning [...] Khan expressed his gratitude that Johar gave him the opportunity. His next appearance was in Danish Aslam's coming-of-age romantic comedy Break Ke Baad. A commercial failure, the film (and his performance) received mixed reviews; while Namrata Joshi of Outlook labelled his performance [...] "earnest", Anupama Chopra said that [...] "Imran is saddled with a bland, supporting role".|$|E

Liverpool's victory meant Rush won {{the competition for}} the fifth time in his career, which is a record. McManaman was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as man of the match. McManaman praised the performance of the Bolton players: [...] "Give Bolton their due, they battled {{back in the second half}} like we knew they would but it was a great team effort by our lads and I was just happy to get two goals like that." [...] Liverpool manager Roy Evans praised the performance of McManaman stating: [...] "The two goals were fantastic.

[...] Evans was also delighted to have won his first trophy as Liverpool manager: [...] "We believed that we've always had a decent squad with players of outstanding ability.

500|$|In the 2006–07 Serie A campaign, Kaladze {{scored a}} goal against Sampdoria {{which turned out}} to be his only goal of the season. Milan {{finished}} in fourth place with an eight-point deduction relating to the previous season's scandal. Kaladze won his second Champions League title on 23 May 2007 after Milan beat Liverpool 2–1 in the final; he came on as a 79th-minute substitute in that match. He later picked up the FIFA Club World Cup in December that year where Milan beat Boca Juniors 4–2 in the final, though Kaladze was one of two players to be sent off in that match. He had established himself as a first-team regular in the 2007–08 season, making 32 appearances, but had only featured sparingly in the 2008–09 season due to a knee ligament injury sustained in a UEFA Cup match against Zürich. Kaladze's performance in the 15 February 2009 Milan derby was described as a [...] "horror show" [...] on the Channel 4 website which started a dispute over an alleged smear campaign between Kaladze and the Georgian newspaper Lelo, who used the quote, [...] "Milan really <b>does</b> <b>need</b> a new centre-back after Kakha Kaladze’s horror show in the derby." [...] Milan finished third in the league that season, ten points behind Serie A champions Inter Milan; Kaladze believed this was caused by the many injuries suffered by the Milan squad.|$|E
500|$|After its release, {{the book}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews. It was listed by Rolling Stone {{as one of}} the 10 Best Music Books in 2016. Jason Diamond from the publication reviewed it and found that the book gave a [...] "fuller, weirder and more interesting overview of Madonna" [...] than was already present in previous works about her. He complimented the author's [...] "riveting" [...] way of presenting the past figures from Bay City associated with the singer as well as Simone's own transition into indie music. Jennifer Levin from The Santa Fe New Mexican commended Simone's [...] "wit and grace" [...] in reporting Bay City's troubled relationship with Madonna, including the political agenda surrounding her. She noted that the story found its footing at the point in the book where the author wrote about Flying Wedge (in the last chapter). Writing for PopMatters, Megan Volpert rated the book 7 out of 10 stars, and described it as [...] "excellent", suggesting it as an important addition to modern cultural criticism. She commended Simone's writing and her courage to pick up an unusual subject for the book. Volpert commented, [...] "Does the world need one more half-baked biographical update on Madonna? No, it does not. What the world <b>does</b> <b>need</b> is Simone's productively clear-eyed assessment of her own musical and journalistic failures, [...] for the detours unavoidably provoked by fame and fandom," [...] concluded the review.|$|E

After swimming in the lake, they light a campfire, and share a cannabis joint. An act of blowbacking the joint leads the two to share a kiss and they proceed to make love. Emily wakes up the following morning to find Naomi preparing to leave. She pleads with Naomi not to leave her a second time and tells her that she should accept {{that she needs to}} be loved. Naomi goes home to find Kieran in bed with her mother, and leaves for college, devastated. She sees her teachers rigging the election to prevent Cook from winning, and reveals this to the form when she is announced the winner. As his first presidential act, Cook starts a riot. In the ensuing chaos, Naomi forgives Kieran, encouraging him that if he likes her mother, he should tell her so. Naomi begins to have sex with Cook before she realises that it [...] "isn't right". Surprisingly, Cook doesn't seem to mind, as he says that she must have a good reason not to follow through because she's clever. Naomi leaves, with her and Cook now sharing a better understanding of each other. That night, she visits Emily's house, but Emily refuses to open the door, not wanting Naomi to see her after she had been crying. They sit {{on opposite sides of the}} door, and Naomi admits that she <b>does</b> <b>need</b> somebody to love her. Emily offers her hand through the door's cat flap to Naomi, who finally reciprocates Emily's feelings.|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "The decision to endorse the Palestinian and Arab effort to condemn Israel in the U.N. Security Council is not the choice of a concerned friend trying to help.

2500|$|Three {{different}} {{covers for}} Game Informers first {{preview of the}} game for its October 2010 issue were collaborations between Irrational and the magazine, envisioning what a video game magazine would be like in the early 20th century. Each cover, drawn by Irrational's Rob Waters, is inspired by the cover artwork from The Saturday Evening Post and includes fictional advertisements based on early 20th century variants, including one redrawn from a public domain ad. Kevin Gifford of Gamasutra praised these covers, commented that such a diversion for a game magazine cover represents a paradigm change, in that [...] "developers are beginning to appreciate what magazines can do for their media strategy that online can't", and that because Game Informer <b>does</b> <b>need</b> to vie for space at newsstands, is able to take more creative approaches with such covers as opposed to cover layers designed to gain maximum exposure.
