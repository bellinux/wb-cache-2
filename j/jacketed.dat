5|$|In the 1810s and 1820s, greater {{emphasis}} {{was placed on}} the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The carronade, although initially very successful and widely adopted, disappeared from the Royal Navy in the 1850s, after the development of <b>jacketed</b> steel cannon, by William George Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth. Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are <b>jacketed</b> in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
25|$|Handloaders {{have the}} choice to swage but most choose to {{purchase}} pre-made <b>jacketed</b> bullets, due to the obscure nature of swaging and the specialized, expensive equipment. The process of manufacturing a <b>jacketed</b> bullet is far more complex than for a cast bullet; first, the jacket must be punched from a metal sheet of precise thickness, filled with a premeasured lead core, and then swaged into shape with a high pressure press in multiple steps. This involved process makes <b>jacketed</b> bullets far more expensive on average than cast bullets. Further complicating this are the requirements for controlled expansion bullets (see terminal ballistics), which require a tight bond between the jacket and the core. Premium expanding bullets are, with match grade bullets, at the top tier in expense.|$|E
25|$|A current {{production}} Glock 17 {{consists of}} 34 parts. For maintenance, the pistol disassembles into five main groups: the barrel, slide, frame, magazine, and recoil-spring assembly. The firearm {{is designed for}} the NATO-standard 9×19mm Parabellum pistol cartridge, but can use high-power (increased pressure) +P and +P+ ammunition with either full-metal-jacket or <b>jacketed</b> hollow-point projectiles.|$|E
25|$|While {{originally}} {{sold only}} to handloaders as an inexpensive substitute for <b>jacketed</b> bullets, the plated bullet has come far. The ammunition manufacturer Speer now offers the Gold Dot line, commercially loaded premium handgun ammunition using copper-plated hollow point bullets. The strong bond between jacket and core {{created by the}} electroplating process makes expanding bullets hold together very well, and the Gold Dot line is now in use by many police departments.|$|E
25|$|Surviving dust-jackets on {{the first}} edition are {{exceedingly}} rare. It is not known whether that is because of attrition or because some printings were not <b>jacketed</b> or because lots directed to some markets did not come with jackets. What is known is that jackets have been reported {{on more than one}} of the printings and most commonly {{on the first}} printing. The jacket is a medium blue field all around. The front announces the title in white, beneath which appears, in color and framed in red, Tolkien's illustration of Hobbiton. The reverse displays Tolkien's illustration of Smaug on his trove, also in color.|$|E
25|$|A more {{economical}} alternative was {{made available to}} the handloader in the 1980s, the copper-plated bullet. Copper-plated bullets are lead bullets that are electroplated with a copper jacket. While thinner than a swaged bullet jacket, the plated jacket is far thicker than normal electroplate, and provides significant structural integrity to the bullet. Since the jacket provides the strength, soft lead can be used, which allows bullets to be swaged or cast into shape before plating. While not strong enough for most rifle cartridges, plated bullets work well in many handgun rounds, with a recommended maximum velocity of 1250ft/s (375m/s). Plated bullets fall between cast and traditional <b>jacketed</b> bullets in price.|$|E
500|$|Cho {{also bought}} <b>jacketed</b> hollow-point bullets, which {{result in more}} tissue damage than full metal jacket bullets against unarmored targets by {{expanding}} upon entering soft tissue. Along with a manifesto, Cho later sent {{a photograph of the}} hollow point bullets to NBC News with the caption [...] "All the [...] you've given me, right back at you with hollow points." ...|$|E
500|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} design and {{construction}} of the book itself, praising its similarity to products of late 19th-century publishing. Hoyle notes that the hardback was [...] "embossed rather than <b>jacketed,</b> shaded in a discreet grey and black palette with flashes of a lively petunia pink; inside the paper is thick and creamy, the font is bold and each story has its own title page, provided by Vess." ...|$|E
500|$|The carronade was {{initially}} very successful and widely adopted, {{although in the}} 1810s and 1820s, greater {{emphasis was placed on}} the accuracy of long-range gunfire, and less on the weight of a broadside. The small powder charge of the carronade was only able to project a heavy cannonball over a relatively limited distance. [...] The short barrel, low muzzle velocity and short range also increased the risk that a carronade would eject burning wadding onto nearby combustible materials, increasing the risk of fire. The carronade disappeared from the Royal Navy from the 1850s after the development of steel, <b>jacketed</b> cannon by William George Armstrong and Joseph Whitworth.|$|E
500|$|The bridge {{rested on}} {{abutments}} {{which had been}} <b>jacketed</b> with concrete after its original construction. The arch was supported by voussoirs made of [...] "irregular rubble stone", without a keystone. There was also no stone giving the date or other construction information. The approaches were flanked by wing walls constructed of riprap stones, and the spandrel walls were topped by parapets made of [...] "rough, crenellated stones". The bridge's road deck rested directly {{on the top of}} its arch. This led to a [...] "narrow wall at the arch crown" [...] and a [...] "protruding rock parapet" [...] atop this spandrel wall on either side. Most stone arch bridges have solid parapets without decoration; this bridge's parapet crenellation was an ornamental feature. The parapet construction and appearance made the bridge unique among the 58 Pennsylvania stone arch bridges with which it was nominated for the NRHP.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{shooters}} prefer <b>jacketed</b> bullets, {{especially in}} rifles and pistols. The hard jacket material, generally copper or brass, resists deformation and handles far higher pressures and temperatures than lead. Several companies offer swaging presses (both manual and hydraulic) that will manufacture {{on a small}} scale <b>jacketed</b> bullets that can rival or surpass the quality of commercial <b>jacketed</b> bullets. Two swaging equipment manufacturers offer equipment and dies designed to turn 22 Long Rifle cases into brass jackets for 22 caliber (5.56mm) bullets. A reference manual for bullet swaging is offered by [...]|$|E

2500|$|A coil {{condenser}} {{is essentially a}} [...] "Graham condenser" [...] with an inverted coolant/vapor configuration. [...] It has a spiral coil running {{the length of the}} condenser through which coolant flows, and this coolant coil is <b>jacketed</b> by the vapor/condensate path.|$|E
2500|$|It fired a 6mm (0.236-in. caliber) cartridge, {{which used}} an early {{smokeless}} powder, was semi-rimless, and fired a 135-grain (later 112-grain) <b>jacketed</b> bullet.

2500|$|Currently {{a variety}} of factory {{ammunition}} loadings are available in [...]44 Special, including bullet weights of 135, 165, 180, 200, 240, 246, and [...] at various velocity levels. Special high performance terminal ballistic loads are also offered, such [...] as the Hornady JHP, Winchester Silvertip JHP, Speer Gold Dot JHP, Federal LHP, Cor-Bon JHP, and various other <b>jacketed</b> hollow point and soft point designs.|$|E
2500|$|Some common {{performance}} parameters {{are shown in}} the table below for several [...]357 Magnum loads. Bullet weights ranging from [...] are common. The [...] <b>jacketed</b> hollow point loads are popular for self-defence, whereas the heavier loads are commonly used for hunting. Loads are available with energies from about 400-700 foot pounds of muzzle energy and can be selected for various applications based on desired use and risk assessments.|$|E
2500|$|The rifle {{commission}} {{found that}} the Jarmann with its 10.15mm bullet had a maximum point-blank range of [...] with a 1.8m (6ft) target. At a range of 600 metres (660 yd) it did not spread more than 61cm (24in) with uncoated lead bullets and 46cm (18in) with <b>jacketed</b> bullets. This compared very favorably to the Remington M1867, then the Norwegian standard weapon, with maximum point-blank range of 300 m (330 yd) and spread at 600 m of 96cm (38in).|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} bullets {{there are}} several hard cast [...] diameter bullets that are compatible with the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum. Such bullets, unlike <b>jacketed</b> bullets, {{are designed to be}} driven at reduced velocities. Driving these bullets at [...]460 Weatherby velocities can cause lead to be deposited in the barrel. Regular cast bullets are not recommended with the [...]460 Weatherby as {{the upper end of the}} permissible velocities for these cast bullets is lower than the lowest velocities obtainable from the [...]460 Weatherby Magnum.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]40 S {{cartridge}} {{has been}} popular {{with law enforcement}} agencies in the United States, Canada, and Australia. While possessing nearly identical accuracy, drift and drop as the 9mm Parabellum, it also has an energy advantage over the 9mm Parabellum and [...]45 ACP, and with a more manageable recoil than the 10mm Auto cartridge. Marshall & Sanow (and other hydrostatic shock proponents) contend that with good <b>jacketed</b> hollow point bullets, the more energetic loads for the [...]40 S can also create hydrostatic shock in human-sized living targets.|$|E
2500|$|Two magnetos were {{mounted on}} the outside of each {{cylinder}} bank. [...] Each magneto fired all eight cylinders for that bank, driven by bevel gear from the vertical shaft that also drove the bank's single overhead camshaft. [...] Each cylinder had two vertical inlet valves and a single vertical exhaust valve, all driven by rocking levers from the camshaft. [...] Four carburettors each fed four cylinders via a water <b>jacketed</b> manifold. Each cylinder exhausted into an individual pipe in the space between the cylinder blocks. The whole construction was protected by patents until 1935.|$|E
2500|$|The [...]45 Colt remains {{popular with}} renewed {{interest}} in Cowboy Action Shooting. Additionally, the round has seen resurgence as a cartridge in handgun hunting and Metallic Silhouette Shooting competitions beginning in the 1950s {{with the introduction of}} stronger heavier framed handguns. The cartridge's popularity has also increased with the increased marketing of handguns that can also fire the [...]410 bore shotgun shell, such as the Taurus Judge and the S Governor. The modern [...]45 Colt bullet has changed as well, and it is now [...]451 inches in diameter for <b>jacketed</b> bullets, and [...]452 for lead bullets. The [...]45 Colt became the basis for other rounds, such as the [...]454 Casull.|$|E
2500|$|The Hague Conventions also {{prohibited}} {{the employment of}} [...] "arms, projectiles, or material calculated to cause unnecessary suffering". The Japanese government cited this prohibition on 10 August 1945 after submitting a letter of protest to the United States denouncing the use of atomic bombs. However, the prohibition only applied to weapons as lances with a barbed head, irregularly shaped bullets, projectiles filled with glass, {{the use of any}} substance on bullets that would tend unnecessarily to inflame a wounded inflicted by them, along with grooving bullet tips or the creation of soft point bullets by filing off the ends of the hard coating on full metal <b>jacketed</b> bullets.|$|E
2500|$|However, opponents {{assert that}} the upper San Joaquin River, already {{straight}} <b>jacketed</b> by dams (Mammoth Pool, No. 6, Redinger, Kerckhoff, Friant, and scores more on tributaries) will not provide sufficient discharge to fill the reservoir except in very wet years. The new reservoir would destroy [...] of whitewater runs, fishing spots and historic sites on the San Joaquin River, and inundate two Big Creek Hydro powerhouses, causing a potential net loss of electricity generation. Temperance Flat would cause significant evaporation and the water required to fill it would only further stress the San Joaquin River's already strained water supplies, in addition to draining even more {{money out of the}} state's floundering budget.|$|E
2500|$|Bullets must be well {{balanced}} and consistent in weight, shape, and seating depth {{to ensure that}} they correctly engage the rifling, exit the barrel at a consistent velocity, and fly straight. [...] Buying bullets from a high quality source will help ensure quality, but for ultimate accuracy some shooters will measure even the best bullets, and reject all but the most consistent. [...] Measurement of the weight is the easiest, and bullets that are out of round can be detected by rotating the bullet while measuring with a micrometer. [...] There is even a device available that will detect changes in jacket thickness and internal voids in <b>jacketed</b> rifle bullets, though its high cost makes it prohibitively expensive for all but the most dedicated shooters.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} {{companies}} that manufacture [...]38 Special ammunition. [...] It {{can range from}} light target loads to more powerful defensive ammunition. [...] Because of the relatively low pressure that the [...]38 Special cartridge and even its more powerful +P version can be loaded to, most 38 Special bullets do not expand reliably, even when using hollow-point designs, especially if fired from a short-barreled or 'snub-nose' revolver. In 2004, Speer Bullets introduced the Gold Dot <b>jacketed</b> hollow-point [...]38 Special cartridge {{in an attempt to}} solve this very problem. [...] Another solution is to use an unjacketed soft lead hollow-point bullet as found in the FBI Load. [...] The latter's 158-grain soft lead hollow point is loaded to +P pressures and velocity, which ensures more reliable expansion in unprotected flesh, even when fired in a 2-inch short-barreled revolver.|$|E

60|$|Five {{minutes later}} five capped and <b>jacketed</b> figures were scurrying {{up the street}} in the frosty, starlit December dusk. Miss Allen in her cold little room heard their gay voices and sighed. She was crying by herself in the dark. It was Christmas for {{everybody}} but her, she thought drearily.|$|E
60|$|Oh, our {{guards were}} brutes! And under their {{treatment}} {{we had to}} harden to brutes in order to live. Hard work makes calloused hands. Hard guards make hard prisoners. We continued to talk, and, on occasion, to be <b>jacketed</b> for punishment. Night was the best time, and, when substitute guards chanced to be on, we often talked through a whole shift.|$|E
60|$|A week before, he {{had come}} upon them. In the ensuing battle he had lost two of his own men, but the {{punishment}} inflicted upon the marauders had been severe almost to extinction. A half dozen, perhaps, had escaped; but the balance, {{with the exception of}} the five prisoners, had expiated their crimes before the nickel <b>jacketed</b> bullets of the legionaries. And, best of all, the ring leader, Achmet ben Houdin, was among the prisoners.|$|E
6000|$|... "But, yes. I {{took the}} whole {{condition}} upon myself. You were not Nora, you were Frona; nor I Torvald, but Gregory. When {{you made your}} exit, capped and <b>jacketed</b> and travelling-bag in hand, it seemed I could not possibly stay and finish my lines. And when the door slammed and you were gone, {{the only thing that}} saved me was the curtain. It brought me to myself, or else I would have rushed after you {{in the face of the}} audience." ...|$|E
60|$|With {{the word}} I threw forward the Remington and let drive. Following the bellow of the rifle, so loud in that thin air, a sharp, harsh report cracked up from below. A puff of yellow dust rose {{in front of}} the lioness. I was in line, but too far ahead. I fired again. The steel <b>jacketed</b> bullet hit a stone and spitefully whined away into the canyon. I tried once more. This time I struck close to the lioness. Disconcerted by a cloud of dust rising before her very eyes she wheeled and ran back.|$|E
60|$|The good lady {{must have}} had a hint from the authorities, for she kept Grisell under her wing in the huge household, which was like a city in itself. There was a knight who acted as steward, with innumerable knights, squires, and pages under him, besides the six hundred red <b>jacketed</b> yoemen, and {{servants}} of all degrees, in the immense court of the buttery and kitchen, as indeed there had need to be, for six oxen were daily cooked, with sheep and other meats in proportion, and any friend or acquaintance of any one in this huge establishment might come in, and not only eat and drink his fill, but carry off as much meat as he could on the point of his dagger.|$|E
60|$|On {{this night}} things were, with one exception, in nowise {{different}} from any other night. Seven of them, with glimmering eyes and steady legs, had capped a day of Scotch with swivel-sticked cocktails and sat down to dinner. <b>Jacketed,</b> trousered, and shod, they were: Jerry McMurtrey, the manager; Eddy Little and Jack Andrews, clerks; Captain Stapler, of the recruiting ketch Merry; Darby Shryleton, planter from Tito-Ito; Peter Gee, a half-caste Chinese pearl-buyer who ranged from Ceylon to the Paumotus, and Alfred Deacon, a visitor who had stopped off from the last steamer. At first wine was served by the black servants to those that drank it, though all quickly shifted back to Scotch and soda, pickling their food as they ate it, ere it went into their calcined, pickled stomachs.|$|E
60|$|From {{the other}} window {{all she could}} see were more trees, <b>jacketed</b> with lichen and stockinged with moss. At their roots were {{stemless}} yellow fungi like lemons and apricots, and tall fungi with more stem than stool. Next were more trees close together, wrestling for existence, their branches disfigured with wounds resulting from their mutual rubbings and blows. It was the struggle between these neighbors that she had heard in the night. Beneath them were the rotting stumps of those {{of the group that}} had been vanquished long ago, rising from their mossy setting like decayed teeth from green gums. Farther on were other tufts of moss in islands divided by the shed leaves--variety upon variety, dark green and pale green; moss-like little fir-trees, like plush, like malachite stars, like nothing on earth except moss.|$|E
