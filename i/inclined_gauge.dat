50|$|The {{branch line}} to Clee Hill {{operated}} between 1864 and 1962, {{and ran up}} to the hill via the villages of Middleton of Bitterley, where a marshalling yard was situated. Two rope <b>inclines,</b> one narrow <b>gauge</b> and one standard gauge, carried stone from the quarries on the Titterstone Clee Hill down to this yard. The standard <b>gauge</b> <b>incline</b> {{was one of the}} longest in Great Britain.|$|R

5000|$|In June 1931, the [...] narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>incline</b> railway {{was built}} {{to the bottom of}} the gorge through a narrow cleft just west of the north end of the bridge. In August 1931, the first suicide {{occurred}} when a man from Pueblo, Colorado jumped off the bridge. In 1937, a lighting system was installed to illuminate the bridge and the gorge walls.|$|R
5000|$|The Light Railways Act {{was passed}} in 1896, {{designed}} to facilitate {{the construction of new}} lines where there was no controversy over routing, and in 1898 the PD&SWJR investigated the possibility of connecting the ECMR line to its own line as a light railway. This proved feasible, and the Bere Alston and Calstock Light Railway Order was confirmed by the Board of Trade on 12 July 1900; as well as the new line, the Order authorised the acquisition of the ECMR line and its operation as a passenger light railway (excepting the <b>incline).</b> The <b>gauge</b> was to remain [...] In fact finance was impossible to obtain, and eventually the LSWR was persuaded to guarantee borrowings.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the 36 meter {{difference}} in elevation between the upstream dam and its terminus, an inclined plane was built, which allowed boats {{to travel on}} land via {{the use of a}} flat car on which they were placed. Operation of the [...] track <b>gauge</b> <b>incline</b> ceased in 1948, but part of its structure has been preserved and is now a tourist attraction, famous for its ornamental cherry trees.|$|R
50|$|The aim of {{developing}} Colton mine {{was to give}} an income until the Syndicate's main hope - Timwood - started to produce, but output was disappointing (a mere 4800 tons of ore was raised in 1908-10) and what ore was produced caked furnaces and proved almost unsaleable. In desperation the Syndicate erected plant at Washford to turn the poor ore into briquettes, thereby reducing volume, mass and impurities, but the undercapitalised venture failed in 1909 and all mining ceased, including Colton. The Syndicate voted to be wound up on 24 March 1910 and its assets were auctioned off on 28 June that year. in modern times only the faintest traces of the workings, <b>incline</b> and narrow <b>gauge</b> railway can be detected.|$|R
500|$|The Colton {{investment}} {{sought to}} give an income while the Syndicates' greater hope was developed— a new iron mine near {{the foot of the}} incline at Timwood. The concept was to mine laterally into the foot of the hill rather than downwards from the top, which inevitably involved significant costs in pumping water, raising ore and lowering it again. Like Colton Pit, Timwood used [...] gauge hopper wagons underground. At Colton they were pushed to the 2ft gauge tracks described above. The ore was tipped onto a stockpile then gravity-fed into 2ft tipplers which were taken to the standard gauge line, tipped again then lowered down the original incline. At Timwood the 16 inch gauge tipplers were to be pushed a short distance to the standard gauge line and tipped once, completely bi-passing both narrow and standard <b>gauge</b> <b>inclines.</b>|$|R
40|$|The writers wish {{to thank}} the discusser for his {{valuable}} comments. While the writers are in general agreement with the discusser, some of his points warrant further clarification. Firstly, {{the aim of the}} paper was to investigate the effectiveness of the geocell mattress used as reinforcement in subballast under cyclic loading. The authors agree that the vertical strains reported for the geocell and subballast were different in magnitude from those reported for the geocell mattress. This is because strains in the geocell mattress were measured using strain gauges attached to the geocell strips. Strain <b>gauges</b> <b>inclined</b> in both vertical and horizontal directions were used to measure axial and radial strains, respectively. As clearly stated in the original paper, linear variable differential transformers (LVDTs) were used for recording the vertical and lateral strains of unreinforced as well as reinforced subballast specimens...|$|R

5000|$|The Knoxville Incline was a broad <b>gauge</b> <b>inclined</b> railway {{that ran}} between Pittsburgh's South Side and Allentown neighborhoods. The incline was {{constructed}} in 1890 and had a track gauge of 9 ft. The charter was in planning as of January 1890, with a target filing date of February 8 of that year, and was originally {{to be called the}} Arlington Avenue Inclined Plane. The last day of service was December 3, 1960. It was demolished in 1960. [...] It was designed by John H. McRoberts, with a length of 2644 feet. The Knoxville Incline briefly controlled the Pittsburgh, Knoxville & St. Clair Electric Railroad, while itself being later controlled by Pittsburgh Railways. During its operation, the incline ferried people and freight between the South Side and Knoxville. The Knoxville Incline and the nearby Mount Oliver Incline enabled the development of land in Allentown and surrounding communities on the hilltop. Like the Nunnery Hill Incline, the Knoxville Incline featured a curve, an unusual engineering feat for an incline.|$|R
40|$|Statistics are {{indispensable}} {{factors for}} the amelioration of safety. Through the reconciliation of accidents which may appear isolated to interested parties, they permit tracking of typical causes of accidents; conversely, they can prevent, after a serious accident due to some fortuitous cause, {{the taking of}} incautious measures {{under the pressure of}} public opinion, which always <b>inclines</b> to <b>gauge</b> the gravity of the causes by that of the results. Lastly, they permit appraisal of the efficacy of rules in force. We should add that statistics provide an agency of prevention for future accidents. A careful inspection of all signs of malfunction of material quite often prevents the occurrence of an accident. In this respect, many pilot's report, perfectly normal in every way as far as operation is concerned, can reveal much more interesting technical data than an accident, although it does not diminish the importance of statistics. Therefore, from the inception of its aeronautical service, at the end of 1922, the Bureau Veritas has kept annual statistics of all accidents which occurred in French civil aviation. In order to correctly perform their proper function, the statistics must be exact and sufficiently explicit and complete. To be exact, they must bear on all pertinent events, and on these alone. It is a matter then, first of all, defining the accident {{in such a way that}} no sinister detail bearing on the definition may escape control. The consideration of accidents to personnel only has appeared too limited. One of the essential qualities of statistics is to permit the taking of averages and in consequence to apply them ot a sufficiently large number; such is happily not the case in accidents to personnel...|$|R
5000|$|Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Plane was a [...] narrow <b>gauge</b> <b>incline</b> railway {{that ran}} from the {{northern}} end of the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Tunnel to Carson Street in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Originally built to carry coal from the Jacob Beltzhoover mine, it was sold by the Pittsburgh Coal Company to the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad in 1871. It was used only for coal as early as 1864, passenger traffic was added in 1874 for the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad. For safety reasons, the tunnel was closed to passenger traffic, and passengers were diverted to the Castle Shannon Incline, constructed in 1890. Emergency use of the plane for passengers and freight continued as late as 1900. [...] Its use for the transport of passengers and freight other than coal was made obsolete by the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel. Operation as a coal incline continued until May 1, 1912.It was operated as a gravity plane, with returning empty cars being pulled to the mine mouth by the weight of the descending full coal cars.|$|R
5000|$|Despite its {{elevation}} of 260 metres being considerably {{lower than that}} of Denniston (600 metres), the steep grade between the coastline and Millerton still meant that the coal was difficult to get down from the hilltop to the coastal railway near sea level. The Westport Coal Company built the Millerton Incline in 1891 and the Millerton Mine began production in 1896. Mining at Millerton ended in the late 1960s, as it largely did at Denniston. The Millerton Incline was a narrow <b>gauge</b> (...) <b>incline</b> consisting of two parallel sets of tracks on which the coal tubs ran, being hauled by rope. Remnants of tracks, trucks, bath house and other installations are still visible.The Millerton Incline was a significant engineering achievement for its time, and the remains of this incline and its infrastructure are more accessible than those of the more famous Denniston Incline. The Millerton Incline was used to convey tubs of coal from the mines around the Millerton area to the bins at Granity, which were once the largest coal loading bins of wooden construction in New Zealand. The bins no longer exist, but the incline remains and can still be seen today.|$|R
2500|$|The [...] {{gauge line}} soon reached Pateley Bridge, and Angram became the 'route engine', working the main line, with another named Bunty {{shunting}} the sidings there. The standard gauge rails were laid from Lofthouse outwards in both directions, {{and when the}} first standard gauge locomotive arrived, it was towed {{along the road to}} Sykes Bank by a Foden steam lorry, its flanged wheels making a mess of the road surface. The main line and sidings became mixed gauge for a while, although the third rail was gradually removed from 1906. At the Angram Dam site, a village for the workers was built, and the railway terminated in several sidings, which included a locomotive shed. The sidings were at a similar level to the crest of the dam. A branch left the main line and descended to the valley floor, where there was a cement mixing plant and more sidings. This line included a winch-operated incline which descended on a gradient of 1 in 15 (6.7%). Another <b>incline,</b> or [...] <b>gauge,</b> ascended {{the far side of the}} valley, giving access to Nidd sluice and lodge. A third incline brought rock down to the main line from a quarry, some [...] below the terminus.|$|R
