40|$|A micromechanical relay {{production}} process involves: (a) applying a sacrificial layer (26) onto a substrate (10) containing or bearing a stationary electrode (18); (b) applying and structuring a conductive layer (32) for defining a beam structure as a mobile counter-electrode (39) and applying a contact region (40) {{such that the}} conductive layer (32) extends between an anchoring region and the contact region (40) and is insulated from the contact region (40); and (c) etching away the sacrificial layer (26) to produce the beam structure with a mobile region and a region fixed to the substrate (10) by the anchoring region. USE - To produce a micromechanical <b>electrostatic</b> <b>relay</b> useful in battery-powered equipment, e. g. for wireless transmission in communications. ADVANTAGE - The process employs surface micromechanics technology instead of back-face etching so that the process is independent of the substrate material and is space-saving...|$|E
40|$|Abstract — We {{report on}} {{characterization}} of Si-to-Si contact microswitches fabricated in an ultraclean encapsulation process. This three-terminal microswitch {{relies on a}} curved beam (source) that actuates toward the contact terminal (drain) by charging the control terminal (gate). The operation range of this switch from − 60 °C to 300 °C is investigated, which approximately yields a resistance drift of − 200 /K. Our experiments include tests of the high-temperature lifetime during continuous ON–OFF cycles. By reducing Joule heating at the contact, preliminary results demonstrate at least 106 cycles longer lifetime at 400 °C. Subsequently, the failure mode is investigated and reported. The study of ultraclean Si-to-Si contact-based microswitches provides a crucial guideline {{to the field of}} mechanical and electrical failure mechanisms for harsh environment applications.
