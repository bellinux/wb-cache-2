40|$|Building {{morphology}} {{has significant}} influence on operational energy demand of buildings. Energy consumption for space cooling {{accounts for more than}} 75 % of electricity use in typical condominium buildings. With {{increase in the number of}} condominiums in Sri Lanka, the requirement for space cooling has increased resulting in significant energy demands. Accordingly, this study developed a morphology-based model for forecasting cooling energy demand of condominiums. The study employed a quantitative approach involving questionnaire survey and document review to collect data from thirty (30) condominiums in Sri Lanka. The correlation analysis performed on the data collected indicates that the number of floors (0. 940), building height (0. 930), building shape (- 0. 686), grouping of buildings (- 0. 647) window-to-wall-ration (0. 597), <b>gross</b> <b>internal</b> floor <b>area</b> (0. 489), and wall-to-floor-ratio (- 0. 457) have significant correlations with the cooling energy demand of condominiums in Sri Lanka. A multiple linear regression model developed shows that the number of floors and window-to-wall-ration account for 91. 2 % accuracy of the cooling energy estimation for condominiums in Sri Lanka. Thus, using the developed model, the annual cooling energy demand of a condominium can be forecast, considering significant design factors that could inform decisions at the building design and construction stage to ensure energy efficient designs...|$|R

40|$|The student {{accommodation}} {{sector in}} now the best-performing {{asset in the}} UK and US property markets and this is projected to further accelerate, with building refurbishment of existing student accommodations being the preferred method to satisfy growing demand. However, there are no published research studies on refurbishment projects within the student accommodation sector. Refurbishment is an emergent trend to upgrade existing stock to ensure that buildings meet rising energy efficiency demands. Moreover, it is widely affirmed that greenhouse gases contribute to climate change and notably the built environment is a significant contributor, both through its construction and during its operation and use. This paper demonstrates through a comparative case study approach, how greenhouse gases levels can be effectively measured during refurbishment works. There are multiple metrics used for quantification/assessment of greenhouse gases performance and this paper aims to make well-argued recommendations for their best use. Four student accommodation refurbishment projects are presented to compare and contrast differing emission datasets. The results dictate that project cost and duration cannot alone be used to gauge greenhouse gases emissions; more too, in the instance of student accommodation refurbishment, <b>gross</b> <b>internal</b> floor <b>area</b> {{and the number of}} rooms offers a more predictable indicator. It is recommended that refurbishment developers reflect on these recommendations when reporting the primary energy and GHG performance of their refurbishment works. Best practice from this research may be adopted into domestic buildings refurbishment projects...|$|R

This review looks at energy consumption of this fast growing sector. It concentrates on the energy consumption patterns of the funded higher education institutions in the UK. The findings indicate energy consumption in the sector has been on the increase in the 6 years up to 2006; rising by about 2. 7 % above the 2001 consumption levels. This increase is, however, not evenly spread across the entire sector.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this Master's thesis has been to {{investigate}} the performance of different methods of heat recovery from ventilation air. Comparisons have been made with regard to delivered energy for heating of domestic hot water, space heating and ventilation heating. A single-unit dwelling {{was used as a}} basis for the simulations. The house, built in accordance with the Norwegian passive house standard, had a <b>gross</b> <b>internal</b> <b>area</b> of 172. 6 m². Seven different combinations of a heat wheel, an exhaust air CO₂ heat pump and an outdoor air CO₂ heat pump was assessed. Direct [...] acting electricity was used to cover the remaining heat demand in all seven heat recovery models. Three different occupant behaviour models and three different climates (Oslo, Stavanger and Kautokeino) were investigated in order to increase the area of application for the results. The building was simulated in IDA Indoor Climate and Energy, while the heat pump performance was post-processed in Matlab. Several aspects concerning heat recovery, dimensioning, ventilation and heating schedules, heat distribution, etc., have been assessed. Simulations performed for a family of five with a high consumption of domestic hot water in Oslo showed that the required amount of delivered energy for heating was equal to 115 kWh/m²yr, without any heat recovery. The most used heat recovery method in Norway today, a heat wheel, reduces the energy demand by 34 %, down to 76 kWh/m²yr. The most efficient heat recovery model that was found in this report showed a reduction of delivered energy for heating of 68 %, down to 36 kWh/m²yr. This heat recovery model consists of a heat wheel and a heat pump utilizing both ventilation exhaust air and outdoor air. The recommended solution for occupants with a high domestic hot water consumption, when economy is taken into account, is based on a heat wheel and an exhaust air CO₂ heat pump. The amount of delivered energy is reduced by 66 %, down to 40 kWh/m²yr. Any further work within this field should look into the choice of refrigerant, improvements on the heat pump model and the impact of different building sizes. A more in-depth investment analysis of the different heat recovery models, including the heat distribution system in the building, should also be assessed...|$|E
40|$|With {{more than}} 17, 000 {{institutions}} worldwide, {{the carbon dioxide}} emissions produced by the higher education (HE) sector are globally significant {{and the need for}} reduction is apparent. Recent decades have seen the demand for HE expand rapidly. The United Kingdom HE sector, where emission reduction targets have been set, is used to demonstrate that appropriate target setting and legitimate emission reduction strategies are essential for meaningful change on a global scale. This study compares the carbon performance of 20 institutions in the English ‘Russell Group’ of research-intensive universities to their self-set targets, using three key performance indicators: full-time equivalent staff/student numbers, <b>gross</b> <b>internal</b> <b>area</b> and income. It was found that emissions increased for all but two institutions and consequently, targets are extremely ambitious and almost certainly unachievable owing to very high emission growth rates that inhibit future success i. e. London School of Economics’ emissions grew 143 % since 2005 / 06. Observations are supported by a 10 -point appraisal that measures the environmental value of each carbon management plan and the ‘reality check’ equation x- 10, where x is institutional target and - 10 represents a more realistic 2020 institutional target of 10 %, to classify them as either pragmatic or ambitious by comparison. A paradox is highlighted: institutions that set realistic but relatively low targets can be penalised in league tables and lambasted for apparent lack of ambition even when they {{may be more likely to}} succeed in delivering environmental improvements. Although targets promote environmental measures, the results show that action should be favoured over rhetoric. The University of Southampton is used as a case study and forms the focus of a snapshot staff and student questionnaire, highlighting the range of electricity consuming activities (i. e. computer/laptop usage) increasing electricity demand and subsequent emissions. Increasing staff and student awareness on impacts of energy usage will promote a cultural shift in becoming more energy efficient to reduce emissions. It is clear that current carbon management plans are not a good indicator of future performance and that the English HE sector has underestimated the challenge of carbon emissions reduction. Given current trends, pledged targets seem unlikely to be met by English universities and the likely environmental costs may jeopardise the competitiveness of the sector on the global stage if it is not addressed. Methods for assessing Scope 3 emissions need refining and standardizing given they are likely to the most significant portion of a typical university’s carbon footprint. The use of appropriate key performance indicators to foster action and promote realistic target-setting is required at sector-level to achieve the 2020 goa...|$|E
