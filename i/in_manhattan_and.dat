5|$|Before the AirTrain was completed, {{there were}} already plans to extend it to Manhattan. Between September 2003 and April 2004, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, the MTA, the Port Authority, and the New York City Economic Development Corporation {{conducted}} a feasibility study on the Lower Manhattan–Jamaica/JFK Transportation Project. This project would use the LIRR's Atlantic Branch to Downtown Brooklyn and a tunnel to Lower Manhattan. This would provide faster service to JFK via a one-seat ride and LIRR service to Lower Manhattan via a transfer at Jamaica (i.e. the same plan proposed by the RPA in 1999). Under this proposal, baggage could be checked <b>in</b> <b>Manhattan</b> <b>and</b> transferred directly to planes at the airport. The study examined several alternatives, including using the existing Cranberry Street Tunnel or Montague Street Tunnel under the East River, or building an entirely new cross-river tunnel. The project was halted in 2008 before an environmental impact statement could be created.|$|E
