5000|$|A writedown is an {{accounting}} treatment that recognizes the reduced {{value of an}} <b>impaired</b> <b>asset.</b> The value of an asset may change due to fundamental changes in technology or markets. One example is when one company purchases another and pays more than the net fair value of its assets and liabilities. The excess purchase price is recorded on the buying company's accounts as goodwill. If it becomes apparent that the purchased asset {{no longer has the}} value recorded in the goodwill account (i.e., if the asset cannot be resold at the same price), the value in the goodwill asset account is [...] "written down". One example is when Rupert Murdoch's News Corp bought Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones at a 60% premium in 2007, which News Corp. later had to write down by $2.8 billion because of declining advertising revenues.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explains}} the recent decline in bank asset quality using {{the notion of}} information reusability. Banks are viewed as information processors; they exist because of their advantage in extracting the surplus associated with the reusability of borrower-specific information. It is shown that a bank’s incentive to screen loan applicants, and hence maintain {{the quality of its}} assets, depends on the surplus this screening can produce, which in turn depends on information reusability. Two recent changes in banks ’ operating environment are increased competitition and greater temporal volatility in borrower credit risks. The former has directly reduced banks’ informational surplus while the latter has impaired information reusability. Hence screening expenditures have been reduced and the diminution of screening has lowered the quality of bank assets. It is also shown that an increase in deposit insurance premia has an effect similar to that of narrowing interest spreads and therefore will result in reduced asset screening and <b>impaired</b> <b>asset</b> quality. 1...|$|E
40|$|Adequate loan {{classification}} {{practices are}} {{an essential part}} of a sound and effective credit risk-management process in a bank. Failure to identify deterioration in credit quality in a timely manner can aggravate and prolong the problem. Two key issues arise with regard to the use of collateral in the context of loan classification and provisioning. In particular, the questions arise whether collateral should be taken into account in classifying a collateralized loan, and whether it should be considered in calculating provisions.

Less agreement is evident {{on the role of}} foreign banks in achieving this goal. We explore this issue by studying bank-specific data on lending by domestically- and foreign-owned banks in Argentina and Mexico. We find that foreign banks generally have had higher loan growth rates than their domesticallyowned counterparts, with lower proportionate volatility of lending, contributing to lower overall volatility of credit. Additionally, in both countries, foreign banks show notable credit growth during crisis periods. In Argentina, the loan portfolios of foreign and domestic privately-owned banks are similar, and lending rates analogously expand in response to aggregate demand fluctuations. In Mexico, foreign and domestic banks with lower levels of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> have similar loan responsiveness and portfolios. Stateowned banks (Argentina) and banks with high levels of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> (Mexico) have more stagnant loan growth and weak responsiveness to market signals. Overall, these findings suggest that bank health, and not ownership per se, is the critical element in the growth, volatility, and cyclicality of bank credit.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{success of}} Australian and Canadian banks in weathering the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) {{has been noted}} {{by a number of}} commentators. Their earnings, capital levels and credit ratings have all been a source of envy for regulators of banks in Europe, America and the United Kingdom. The G- 20 and the European Union have tried to identify the features of the Canadian and Australian financial systems which have underpinned this success in order to use them in shaping a revised international regulatory framework. Despite this perceived success, the <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> (also known as non-performing loans) of banks in both countries increased several fold over the GFC, and we investigate the determinants of this, using <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> as our measure of bank risk. Previous studies in other countries have tended to focus on the impact of bank specific factors, such as size and return on equity, in explaining bank risk. Our approach involves including those traditional variables, plus Distance to Default (DD), and a novel contagion variable, which is the effect of major global bank DD on Australian and Canadian banks. Using panel data regression over the period 1999 - 2008, we find that various balance sheet and income statement factors are not good explanatory variables for bank risk. In contrast, the contagion variable is significant in explaining Canadian and Australian bank risk, which suggests that prudential regulators should look to specifically allocate a portion of regulatory capital to deal with contagion effects.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the accounting performance of the firms recognizing impairment losses and analyze the accounting behavior of those firms. We focus on two performance measures, i. e. sales margin and earnings to average total asset (ROA). Firms recognizing impairment losses experienced the decrease in ROA before. After the recognition of impairment losses, ROA was improved. That time-series movement is consistent with the conventional view. However, profit margin did not change in such a clear manner. Although, some firms with impairment losses smoothed earnings, we can find only weak evidence on earnings increasing management. On the other hand, we detect the strong evidence of "big bath" accounting. Our results imply the defects in accounting standards of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets,</b> which permits the large room of managerial discretion. ...|$|R

40|$|Malaysian Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) No. 136, Impairment of Assets, {{was issued}} in 2005. The {{standard}} requires public listed companies {{to report their}} non-current assets at no more than their recoverable amount. When the value of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> is recovered, or partly recovered, FRS 136 requires the impairment charges to be reversed to its new recoverable amount. This study tests whether the reversal of impairment losses by Malaysian firms is more closely associated with economic reasons or reporting incentives. The sample of this study consists of 182 public companies listed on Bursa Malaysia (formerly known as the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange) that reported reversals of their impairment charges during the period 2006 - 2009. These firms are matched with firms which do not reverse impairment {{on the basis of}} industrial classification and size. In the year of reversal, this study finds that the reversal firms are more profitable (before reversals) than their matched firms. On average, the Malaysian stock market values the reversals of impairment losses positively. These results suggest that the reversals generally reflect increases {{in the value of the}} previously <b>impaired</b> <b>assets.</b> After partitioning firms that are likely to manage earnings and those that are not, this study finds that there are some Malaysian firms which reverse the impairment charges to manage earnings. Their reversals are not value-relevant, and are negatively associated with future firm performance. On the other hand, the reversals of firms which are deemed not to be earnings managers are positively associated with both future firm performance and current stock price performance, and this is the dominant motivation for the reversal of impairment charges in Malaysia. In further analysis, this study provides evidence that the opportunistic reversals are also associated with other earnings management manifestations, namely abnormal working capital accruals and the motivation to avoid earnings declines. In general, the findings suggest that the fair value measurement in impairment standard provides useful information to the users of financial statements...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} effect of herding {{behaviour}} on the credit quality of bank loans in Australia. We find that bank herding varies with different types of loans. It tends to be more prevalent in owner-occupied housing loans and credit cards than other types of loans. During the global financial crisis period, herding in owner-occupied housing loans was most pronounced due to the flight-to-quality phenomenon in the housing sector. Furthermore, we find that the big four banks tend to herd more than smaller and regional banks. Bank herding behaviour is countercyclical, as it is negatively related to real GDP growth and the cost of funding but is positively related to market risk. Regulatory capital requirements may also encourage herding as banks are required to hold less risk-weighted capital for residential loans. Most importantly, bank herding is related to higher <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> and therefore lower loan quality. Our findings may have implications for policymakers and bank regulators...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to analyze the drivers and {{dynamics}} of credit losses in Australasian banking {{over an extended period}} of time in order to improve the means by which financial institutions manage their credit risks and regulatory bodies safeguard the stability and integrity of the financial system. The analysis is based on a specially constructed data base of credit loss and provisioning data retrieved from original financial reports published by Australian and New Zealand banks. The observation period covers 1980 to 2005, starting at the time when such information was published for the first time in bank financial statements. It moreover covers the time of major crises which occurred in both Australia and New Zealand in the late 1980 s and early 1990 s. The heterogeneity of reporting the data both amongst banks and through time requires the development of a reporting typology which allows data extraction with equivalent informational content. As a thorough study of credit risks requires long data series often not available from third party data providers, the method developed here will provide value to a range of researchers. Based on an evaluation of many alternative proxies which track a bank's credit loss experience (CLE), the thesis proposes a preferred model for <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> expense (as % of loans) as dependent variable, mainly because of its timely nature and good data availability. Explanatory variables include aggregate macro variables of which changes in unemployment and the return in the share markets are found to have the most significant influence on a bank's credit losses. Bank-specific control variables include a pre-provision earnings proxy whose significance points to the use of provisions for the purpose of income smoothing by Australasian banks. The model also controls for size and nature of lending as smaller, retail-oriented housing lenders, on average, exhibit lower loan losses. Clear results are found with regard to the effect of rapid expansion which appears to be followed by a surge of bad debt provisions 2 to 3 years later. Moreover, inefficient banks tend to suffer greater credit losses. An important part of the thesis looks at the characteristics of alternative CLE proxies such as stock of provisions, <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> and write-offs which have been used by earlier literature. Estimating the preferred model with such alternative CLE parameters confirms their peculiarities such as the memory character of stock of provisions and the delayed nature of write-offs. These measures correlate rather poorly amongst themselves which calls for caution in the comparative interpretation of earlier studies that use differing CLE proxies...|$|R

40|$|Beginning {{with the}} {{proposal}} by Enria (2017), the paper discusses the scope for successful bank restructuring through a carveout of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> and {{a transfer of}} these assets to a government-sponsored asset management company. The paper argues {{that the success of}} such an operation requires a use of public funds, either outright or through contingent commitments. Clawback provisions are problematic because they create contingent liabilities that merely shift risks from the assets side to the liabilities sides of banks' balance sheets. The paper distinguishes between asset impairments coming from considerations of prospective returns and asset impairments coming from frictions in the markets in which these assets are traded. It also distinguishes between threats to bank solvency and threats to bank funding/liquidity. In each case, the success of bank restructuring from asset carveouts depends {{on the extent to which}} threats to the bank's solvency is eliminated. If these threats concern bank funding and asset liquidations at depressed prices, public funds may eventually not be needed. If threats to bank solvency come from nonperforming loans, taxpayer support may be essential. The notion of "real economic value" as the price at which assets should be transferred is problematic and leaves ample room for hidden subsidies. The success of restructuring of the individual bank may itself come at a risk to financial stability as the preservation of existing capacities maintains competitive pressure and depresses bank profitability. Additional risks may come from the burden on the government's fiscal stance...|$|R

This paper describes the restructuring of Seoul Bank by the new management team between June 2000 and October 2002, when the bank was sold to Hana Bank in a merger transaction.

40|$|During the {{financial}} and sovereign crisis, governments protected {{the financial}} system from a collapse. The transfer of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> to a bad bank, or a guarantee on these assets, {{is one of the}} state aid measures applied by governments to preserve financial stability. The transfer price or guaranteed value is crucial in the assessment of state aid. The real challenge is thus to determine the state-aid-compatible value of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets,</b> which is called the Real Economic Value (REV). The REV of a portfolio of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> is based on a valuation methodology that was established by the European Commission. This methodology uses, inter alia, a suitable credit risk premia. It is therefore important to compare the risk premia actually applied in the REV method to the long-term average risk premia. For that reason, we examine the relative credit risk premium, also called coverage ratio, which is the ratio between the actual and risk-neutral default probability. The latter is the default probability derived from market quotes. The coverage ratio captures the magnitude of distress and perceived risk in credit markets. We consider coverage ratios for different time periods and quantify its long-term average value. Special attention is given to {{the financial and}} sovereign crisis and their impact on credit risk premia. We compute the actual default probabilities from yearly transition matrices, while the risk-neutral default probabilities are estimated from credit default swaps. We find that the long-term coverage ratios increased by 30 to 80 %. Our results show that coverage ratios have increased since 2008 and that its post-crisis levels (after 2012) are still higher compared to pre-crisis values. If one interprets this increase as a permanent shift in risk premia, it will impact corporates' funding costs. To study the differences between industries in terms of credit risk premia, we change the estimates for the actual default probability and use Moody's Expected Default Frequencies (EDF). For the banking sector, we observe an underestimation of the credit risk before the financial crisis and even after the sovereign crisis this underestimation persists, although to a lesser extent. This observation raises doubts about the applied recovery rate assumption of 40 % for senior debt. We examine therefore if the risk-neutral recovery rates for the banking sector are different from this standard value. To this end, we apply and extend the model of Schläfer and Uhrig-Homburg (2014). The model assumes absolute priority rule, which reinforces that senior creditors are paid back in full before the subordinated debt holders can recover their investment. Historical data shows that for the banking sector the absolute priority rule is not always respected and thus senior debt holders transfer a certain amount of the value, to which they are entitled, to the subordinated debt holders. We include absolute priority rule violation in the model and adjust it to the bank specific liability structure. We find empirical evidence that credit markets assume absolute priority rule violation and that the standard assumption of a risk-neutral recovery rate of 40 % is not valid for senior debt of European banks in the considered time period. Our estimates are higher than these standard assumptions. In the case of absolute priority rule violation, the average recovery rate implied by the market for senior and subordinated debt are respectively 82 % and 73 %. Comparing the average implied recovery rates with their historical counterparts indicates that the recovery risk premium is underestimated for senior debt and subordinated debt. The magnitude of the underestimation of the recovery risk premium on senior debt is smaller than the one on subordinated debt. In the last part of this dissertation, we study banks' coverage ratios by incorporating implied recovery rates in the calculations of credit risk premia. Before the financial crisis (2006 and 2007), we still observe that the credit risk of European banks was underestimated. The credit risk premia increased during the financial and sovereign crisis and reduced again {{in the last years of}} our observation period (2006 - 2014). From the start of the financial crisis, we do not find evidence for the underestimation of banks' credit risk premia, which indicates a permanent shift in banks' coverage ratios. This observation points to higher financing costs on banks' debt compared to pre-crisis levels. Our results imply that corporates will face, ceteris paribus, higher credit risk premia and thus higher financing costs on their debt. For banks, this finding is even more pronounced. With the new resolution regulation for banks, due to the enforcement of the strict application of the absolute priority rule, the implied recovery rates of subordinated debt will decrease. Given that the default probability stays the same, banks' subordinated debt will become more expensive. Our insights are valuable for state aid assessments, for pricing default-prone financial instruments and for risk management practices that estimate risk-neutral default and recovery rates. nrpages: 170 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Quantitative easing (QE) affects banks' {{profitability}} {{in three}} main ways. First, as QE drives up bond prices, banks holding such bonds see their balance sheets strengthened. Second, QE reduces long-term yields and thereby reduces term spreads. With this, the lending-deposit ratio spread falls, {{making it harder}} for banks to generate net interest income on new loans. Last, QE improves the economic outlook, which should help banks exposed to the economy find new lending opportunities and should reduce problems with non-performing loans. The effects of QE on bank profitability are therefore not one directional. If anything, the immediate effect should be positive. Banks themselves have been quite negative about the impact of QE on their net interest income, but they have also acknowledged its positive impact on capital gains (ECB Bank Lending Survey). Lending-deposit spreads for new lending have fallen significantly. Looking at actual bank profits, net interest income has been stable. Moreover, bank profitability has increased mostly as a result of efforts to clean balance sheets of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> (at least until the end of 2015). This is consistent with a reduction in non-performing loans (NPLs), particularly in countries where NPL levels were abnormally high. Moreover, we show that bank profitability in some countries has been a concern for many years now, starting well before the QE programme. The main drivers of low profitability have been non-performing loans, legal risks and other problems unrelated to net interest income, which has remained fairly stable. Overall, the authors cannot yet see any major bank profitability issue arising out of the ECB's QE programme...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to discuss the extent of {{procyclicality}} in European banks’ lending behavior and how much the regulatory and accounting framework may contribute to it. The main focus is the behavior of banks regarding provisioning against <b>impaired</b> financial <b>assets.</b> It also discusses whether a through-the-cycle provisioning regime could serve {{as one of the}} possible regulatory responses to the ongoing financial crisis. Our applied analysis reveals that European banks are among those that provision in a procyclical manner. On the theoretical level, therefore, through-the-cycle provisioning could be helpful in creating a buffer during good times which could then be used during recessions. On the practical level, however, through-the-cycle provisioning would for numerous reasons be difficult to introduce soon and would first need to be aligned with the other components of the international framework for accounting and for the regulation of financial institutions.

40|$|In {{response}} to the recent Financial Crisis - after it had been widely accepted that “a serious disturbance in the economy of Member States” had occurred, and that several measures were required to remedy this disturbance, various Commission communications were adopted. The Communications include: The first Communication which (initially), {{was the only one}} that the Commission adopted intentionally: the Communication on the application of State aid rules to measures taken in relation to financial institutions in the context of the current global financial crisis (hereinafter "the Banking Communication"). However, faced with the pressure to issue more guidelines (such pressure being exerted by Member States), the Commission adopted three further Communications: the Communication on the re capitalisation of financial institutions in the current financial crisis: limitation of aid to the minimum necessary and safeguards against undue distortions of competition (hereinafter "the Recapitalisation Communication"); the Communication “On the treatment of <b>impaired</b> <b>assets</b> in the Community banking sector” (hereinafter, “the Toxic Assets Comunication”) and finally, the Communication on the return to viability and the assessment of restructuring measures in the financial sector in the current crisis under the State aid rules (hereinafter "the Restructuring Communication"). ” Whilst the Banking and Re capitalisation Communications constituted the focus of study in Part I to this paper, this paper will focus on the impact of shadow banking and Basel III on regulatory arbitrage, the corresponding need for greater transparency and disclosure within financial markets – particularly within OTC markets, and impediments to the successful implementation of capital requirements which are aimed at fostering financial stability, coordination and harmonisation. Further, it will consider the extent to which regulators are prepared to deviate from regulations during the implementation of stress-testing and rescue programmes which are aimed at restoring stability to the financial system. The redefinition of quantitative and qualitative standards for capital, in implementing the Supervisory Capital Assessment Programme (SCAP), as illustrated in the paper, should demonstrate the extent to which regulators, independent of shadow banking practices, are prepared to deviate from capital regulations under adverse scenarios where certain regulations prove to be unduly stringen...|$|R
