5|$|The Southern Railway was {{primarily}} a passenger-carrying railway which used most of its resources to extend its electrified lines. There was a continuing need for steam freight locomotives however, although the Traffic Department preferred mixed traffic designs which could also haul passenger trains on the remaining non-electrified lines at peak periods. By the late 1930s the Southern Railway was adequately served with powerful mixed traffic locomotives of the S15 and N and N1 classes, {{but there was a}} need for a smaller <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive</b> with high route availability that could also undertake light passenger duties. This role had been performed by the ex-LSWR 'Jubilee' A12 0-4-2, which were approaching the end of their useful lives.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1887, a yellow fever {{epidemic}} struck many train crews on the neighboring Illinois Central Railroad (IC), providing an unexpected opportunity for faster promotion of firemen on that line. On March 1, 1888, Jones switched to IC, firing a <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive</b> between Jackson, Tennessee and Water Valley, Mississippi.|$|E
25|$|When Baldwin {{emerged from}} {{bankruptcy}} in 1938 it underwent a drastic change in management. The new management revived their development efforts with diesel power {{but the company}} was already too far behind. In 1939 Baldwin offered its first standard line of diesel locomotives, all designed for yard service. By this time, GM-EMD was already ramping up production of diesel passenger locomotives and developing its first diesel road <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
25|$|It was the Eastern Region's Motive Power officer, L.P. Parker, {{who made}} the case for a new design of {{powerful}} <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive,</b> able to shift heavy loads at fast speeds in round trips between distant destinations within the eight-hour shift of the footplate crew. Riddles took up the challenge, initially designing a 2-8-2 locomotive, but settled upon the 2-10-0 wheel arrangement for the increased traction and lower axle load that five coupled axles can provide. The resultant design {{became one of the most}} successful locomotive classes ever constructed in Britain.|$|E

50|$|In Russia, the 0-8-0 type {{locomotives}} {{were represented}} by the various O-class (Osnovnoj-mainline) <b>freight</b> <b>locomotives.</b> They were built {{from the end of}} the 19th century until the 1920s. They were commonly called the Ovechka (Sheep) and were the most common <b>freight</b> <b>locomotives</b> in Tsarist Russia. Some are still preserved in working order.|$|R
25|$|In {{terms of}} power, the L class outclassed {{most of the}} Victorian Railways fleet when {{introduced}} in 1953, surpassed only by steam locomotive H220. L1150 was able to better {{the performance of the}} famed S class in hauling a 600-ton load up the 1 in 50 gradient of Glenroy Bank. The L was also able to haul an 1,100 ton load between Dandenong and Oakleigh stations in around half the time taken by VR's most powerful <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the X class, allowing heavy freight trains from Gippsland to avoid delaying suburban passenger services sharing the same route.|$|E
25|$|As {{locomotive}} types {{began to}} diverge {{in the late}} 19th century, freight engine designs at first emphasised tractive effort, whereas those for passenger engines emphasised speed. Over time, <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive</b> size increased, and {{the overall number of}} axles increased accordingly; the leading bogie was usually a single axle, but a trailing truck was added to larger locomotives to support a larger firebox that could no longer fit between or above the driving wheels. Passenger locomotives had leading bogies with two axles, fewer driving axles, and very large driving wheels in order to limit the speed at which the reciprocating parts had to move.|$|E
25|$|In 1941 Britain {{started to}} supply {{two types of}} 2-8-0 Consolidation <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive</b> to its Middle East Command. One was the ROD 2-8-0 class that had been {{designed}} in 1911 as the Great Central Railway Class 8K and that the UK's War Department (WD) had adopted as a standard design to be mass-produced for military traffic in the First World War. The other was the London, Midland and Scottish Railway Stanier 8F that had been designed in 1935 and that the WD now adopted as a standard design to be mass-produced for military use in the Second World War.|$|E

25|$|The PRR had {{a design}} style that it favored in its locomotives. One example was the square-shouldered Belpaire firebox. This British-style firebox was a PRR {{trademark}} that was rarely used by other locomotive builders in the U. S. PRR also used track pans extensively to retrieve {{water for the}} locomotive while in motion. Using this system meant that the tenders of their locomotives had a comparatively large proportion of coal (which could not be taken on board while running) compared to water capacity. Locomotives of the PRR had a clean look to them. Only necessary devices were used and they were mounted neatly on the locomotive. Smoke box fronts bore a round locomotive number board denoting a <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive</b> or a keystone number board denoting a passenger locomotive. Otherwise the smoke box was uncluttered except for a headlamp {{at the top and}} a steam-driven turbo-generator behind it. In later years the positions of the two were reversed, since the generator needs more maintenance than the lamp.|$|E

500|$|Due to {{its primary}} {{role as a}} <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive,</b> the Q Class carried the Southern Black livery. [...] Locomotive number and [...] "Southern" [...] were located on the tender, and were painted in Sunshine Yellow. The {{numbering}} of the locomotives under the Southern Railway ranged from 530549. [...] Even though they were built under the tenure of Bulleid, the locomotives never followed his adaptation of the UIC classification system which refers {{to the number of}} leading, trailing and driving axles – in this case three. [...] Under this system, this class would have had the prefix [...] "C" [...] before the numbers, such as C30. [...] In the event, this form of numbering was granted to Bulleid's Q1 Class locomotives of 1942.|$|E
500|$|During the First World War, the LSWR {{management}} {{wished to}} address the requirement for a modern, standard heavy <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive</b> to work from London's freight yards to the southwest of England. As the LSWR lacked existing freight designs capable of undertaking this task, a new design was needed to serve the south coast ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton. The design was also to power traffic including milk trains, which required fast transit to the dairies in London. [...] Robert Urie used this opportunity to develop his recent H15 class design further, applying the 4-6-0 locomotive concept to a purpose-built freight design built to order number S15. It was this order number that gave the class the name [...] "S15".|$|E

500|$|This was {{the third}} design by Robert Urie for the LSWR. The outline was made during the First World War, and {{incorporated}} {{lessons learned from the}} operation of his H15 class, a design that was to provide the basis for future standardisation on the LSWR. To economise on maintenance, the S15 class had interchangeable components that could be used on a similar design, the N15 class passenger locomotive, which had the same overall appearance. Details such as the boiler, the two-cylinders and valve gear were standardised between the classes, although a taper boiler was used on the S15 and N15 classes, as opposed to the parallel boiler of the H15 class. The only other major difference was the smaller diameter of the driving wheels. [...] Smaller diameter wheels gave better traction, essential for a fast <b>freight</b> <b>locomotive.</b>|$|E
