5|$|The M21 had a {{different}} layout from the early M4 and M4A1 MMC, {{as it was the}} replacement of the M4. The major <b>difference,</b> <b>was</b> that the M21 and the M4 were based on different half-tracks (the M4 was based on the M2 Half-track while the M21 was based on the M3 Half-track). The major <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> the location and direction of the mortar (the M4's mortar was rear-facing and was near the back, while the M21's mortar was front-facing and was closer to the front).|$|E
5000|$|Neurobiological <b>differences</b> have <b>been</b> {{found between}} {{individuals}} {{with eating disorders}} (ED) and healthy individuals.

30|$|Simple <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> most {{representative}} if the <b>difference</b> level <b>is</b> {{independent of}} the perfusion level. Logarithmic <b>differences</b> will <b>be</b> more representative if the right/left ratio (rather than the simple <b>difference)</b> <b>is</b> {{independent of the}} perfusion level, {{in which case the}} average side difference will grow proportionally with the perfusion level.|$|R
50|$|Subtraction is {{the inverse}} of addition. Subtraction finds the {{difference}} between two numbers, the minuend minus the subtrahend. If the minuend {{is larger than the}} subtrahend, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> positive; if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> negative; if they <b>are</b> equal, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> 0.|$|R
5|$|The ballots {{from abroad}} that were {{considered}} potentially contentious {{before the election}} proved to have very {{little effect on the}} result. While Peterle received more votes from abroad than Türk, both the total number of votes and the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> smaller than expected (3693 for Peterle and 3040 for Türk).|$|E
5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially different, but that this <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{the flawed}} images {{showed that the}} cause of the problem was that the primary mirror had been {{polished}} to the wrong shape. Although it was probably the most precisely figured optical mirror ever made, smooth to about 10 nanometers, at the perimeter it was too flat by about 2,200 nanometers (2.2 micrometers). This <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> catastrophic, introducing severe spherical aberration, a flaw in which light reflecting off the edge of a mirror focuses on a different point from the light reflecting off its center.|$|E
50|$|In general, 8 of 10 {{positive}} <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> {{not significant}} (p = 0.11), but 9 of 10 positive <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> significant (p = 0.0215).|$|R
30|$|The A values {{greater than}} 0 {{indicated}} that the <b>difference</b> in intra-group <b>is</b> greater than that in inter-group, but less than 0 represented that the <b>difference</b> in inter-group <b>is</b> greater than that in intra-group. Observe-delta value is smaller which indicates that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> small within groups, and the Expect-delta value is greater which indicates that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> great between groups. The significance value below 0.05 indicate that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> significant.|$|R
30|$|The {{significance}} of <b>differences</b> <b>was</b> assessed using two-tailed Student’s t tests or one-way ANOVA. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> {{considered to be}} significant {{at a level of}} p[*]<[*] 0.05.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections of the train. This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers. Intended to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> different ornamentation on the compartment doors.|$|E
5|$|Auxiliary uniform, armour, {{weapons and}} {{equipment}} were probably standardised {{by the end}} of the Julio-Claudian period. Auxiliary equipment was broadly similar to that of the legions (see Section 2.1 below for possible differences in armour). By 68AD, there was little difference between most auxiliary infantry and their legionary counterparts in equipment, training and fighting capability. The main <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> that auxilia contained combat cavalry, both heavy and light, and other specialized units that legions lacked.|$|E
5|$|Debate has {{occurred}} regarding whether the sea mink was its own species, or a subspecies of the American mink. Those {{who argue that}} the sea mink was a subspecies often {{refer to it as}} Neovison vison macrodon. A study in 1911 by Frederic Brewster Loomis, an American paleontologist, concluded that the differences between the American mink and the sea mink were too minute to justify the latter's classification as a separate species, and he named it Lutreola vison antiquus. A study conducted in 2000 by Mead et al. refuted Loomis by claiming that the size range for the largest sea mink specimen was beyond that of the American mink, thereby making it a separate species. But a 2001 study by Graham concluded that this size <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> insufficient evidence to classify the sea mink as its own species and that it should be considered a subspecies. Graham supposed that the size <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> caused by environmental factors. Furthermore, Graham reported that Mead assumed the smaller mink specimens to be the American mink, and the larger mink specimens outside the range of the American mink to be sea minks; this may have been a case of sexual dimorphism wherein all specimens were sea minks, the larger being male and the smaller being female. A 2007 study compared the dental makeup of the sea mink to the American mink, and concluded that they were distinct enough to be considered separate species.|$|E

40|$|There <b>are</b> <b>differences</b> {{between human}} beings, {{and some of}} these <b>differences</b> <b>are,</b> for many, a matter of identity. Some people are men, and some are white. Some people are poor, others are wealthy. These identity-constituting <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> deeply {{connected}} with different kinds of injustices. Susan Hekman's main contention in The Future of <b>Differences</b> <b>is</b> that a new epistemology is required if we are to acknowledge all these differences (p. 27) and, consequently, address these injustices...|$|R
30|$|Results were {{presented}} as mean ± SEM. For comparison between two groups, <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> analyzed by 2 -tailed Student’s t-test. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> considered significant at {{a value of}} P < 0.05.|$|R
5|$|Emilia Martins' 1998 study {{compared}} the head-bob displays {{from the source}} population on Cuba with these animals on Isla Magueyes. The durations and pauses were longer {{by as much as}} 350% in the feral population. In comparison, the blue iguana of Grand Cayman's head-bob displays differed from those of the animals on Cuba by only about 20%. The rapid change in display structure between the colony of animals on Isla Magueyes and those on Cuba illustrated the potential of small founding population size as a catalyst to evolution with regard to communication or display. In this case the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> by only six generations at most.|$|E
5|$|Holkar {{was offered}} terms {{similar to those}} offered to Shinde; the only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> that Holkar {{accepted}} and respected the independence of Amir Khan. The Court of Holkar was at this time practically nonexistent. When Tantia Jog, {{an official of the}} Holkar, urged acceptance of the offer he was suspected of being in collusion with the British. In reality he made the suggestion because he was aware {{of the power of the}} British as he had seen their armies in action when he had commanded a battalion in the past. Holkar responded to the Peshwa's call for insurrection against the British by initiating a battle in Mahidpur.|$|E
5|$|In 1811, Bavaria legally {{defined the}} apothecaries' pound as 360.00g (an ounce of 30.00g). In 1815, Nuremberg lost {{its status as}} a free city and became part of Bavaria. From now on the Nuremberg apothecaries' pound was no longer the {{official}} apothecaries' pound in Nuremberg; but the <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> only 0.6%. In 1836 the Greek apothecaries' pound was officially defined by this standard, four years after Otto, the son of the king of Bavaria, became the first king of Greece. But only few German states followed the example of Bavaria, and with a long delay. The apothecaries' pound of 360g was also adopted in Lübeck, where it was official as of 1861.|$|E

5|$|In the {{two main}} engagements, the fighter losses had been about equal. The big <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> the bombers losses. Fighter Command had had greater success against the {{afternoon}} attack rather than the morning assault, which it out numbered 2:1. The ratio of German fighters to bombers had been 3:1 in the morning but 5:1 in the afternoon, so there were more targets. The more bombers Kesselring sent, the more were lost.|$|E
5|$|Lê Duẩn visited China from 20–25 November 1977 to seek aid. CPC Chairman Hua Guofeng {{stated that}} Sino/Vietnamese {{relations}} had deteriorated because they held different principles. Hua insisted that China {{could not help}} Vietnam because of its own economic difficulties and differences in principles. Lê Duẩn countered that the only <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> how they viewed the Soviet Union and the United States. Following his visit, China (Xinhua) condemned COMECON. China halted all economic development projects between May and July 1978. During this period total Chinese aid to Vietnam amounted to $300 million.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina again {{consulted}} Day on {{the prospective}} engagement. Day did not approve, claiming the age <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> too great, although Bicknell {{was only two}} years older than Day. Bicknell decided to tell Sabrina the truth about the experiment, that she was hand-picked to be Day's wife from childhood, and that all of Day's actions were designed to further his goal of turning her into the ideal bride. Horrified, Sabrina wrote to Day to confront him over Bicknell's statements. Day admitted the truth but refused to apologise. After a series of letters, Day gave his consent to the marriage, telling her that the letter would be his final communication with her.|$|E

5|$|The Soviets did {{not simply}} {{replicate}} the Vickers 6-Ton. However, like its British counterpart, the T-26 mod. 1931 had a twin-turreted configuration and {{was designed to}} carry two machine guns, mounting one in each turret. A major <b>difference</b> <b>was</b> that the Soviet T-26 mod. 1931 had higher turrets (with an observation slit) than the British 6-Ton. Soviet turrets had a round firing port for the DT tank machine gun, {{as opposed to the}} rectangular ports used by the original British design for the Vickers machine gun. The front part of the hull was also slightly modified.|$|E
