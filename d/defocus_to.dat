50|$|Oblique {{illumination}} {{dispersion staining}} {{is the result}} of refraction and the convex shape of most particles. With oblique illumination the beam of light illuminating the sample is directed at an oblique angle through the sample. This enhances the resolution of structural details in the particle that are oriented at right angles to the incident beam of light while sacrificing some of the resolution of features parallel to the direction of the beam. Because of this orientation of the beam the relative refractive index of the particle and the mounting liquid becomes apparent. The wavelengths for which the liquid has the higher refractive index are refracted into the front lens of the objective {{from the side of the}} particle nearest the side from which the light is coming. If the particle has a higher refractive index for all visible wavelengths then this side of the particle is dark. The side farthest from the source of the light shows all the wavelengths for which the particle has the higher refractive index. These effects are seen with the particle in sharp focus. This is a significant advantage over the Becke` line method because the particle doesn’t have to be <b>defocus</b> <b>to</b> see the colors and generally the colors are more distinct than are the Becke` line dispersion colors. The colors seen with this type of dispersion staining are about the same as those with the Becke` Line method shown in Chart 1.

Filters made of photographic film neutralised or doubled the SCE. Contrast sensitivities were measured with a 6 mm pupil diameter, <b>defocus</b> <b>to</b> 2 D, and three SCE conditions (normal, neutralised and doubled). Modulation transfer functions were derived after measuring transverse aberrations with a vernier alignment technique, and were used to predict contrast sensitivity functions (CSFs).

The influences of the SCE-modifying filters were generally of similar magnitude and direction to predictions, thus supporting the apodisation model of the SCE. The magnitudes of SCE influence between SCE-neutralised and SCE-doubled conditions were usually small at about 0. 2 – 0. 3 log unit, with a maximum influence of 0. 5 log unit. Influences of the SCE were greater for myopic than for hypermetropic defocus. As measured by the CSF and an apodisation model, this study is in agreement with previous theoretical work and one experimental study in indicating that the SCE plays a minor role in improving spatial visual performance...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} produce bright images, {{projectors}} have large apertures and hence narrow depths of field. In this paper, we present methods for robust scene capture and enhanced image display based on projection defocus analysis. We model a projector’s defocus using a linear system. This model is used to develop a novel temporal defocus analysis method to recover depth at each camera pixel by estimating the parameters of its projection defocus kernel in frequency domain. Compared to most depth recovery methods, our approach is more accurate near depth discontinuities. Furthermore, by using a coaxial projector-camera system, we ensure that depth is computed at all camera pixels, without any missing parts. We show that the recovered scene geometry {{can be used for}} refocus synthesis and for depth-based image composition. Using the same projector defocus model and estimation technique, we also propose a defocus compensation method that filters a projection image in a spatiallyvarying, depth-dependent manner to minimize its defocus blur after it is projected onto the scene. This method effectively increases the depth of field of a projector without modifying its optics. Finally, we present an algorithm that exploits projector <b>defocus</b> <b>to</b> reduce the strong pixelation artifacts produced by digital projectors, while preserving the quality of the projected image.

Because of concern {{about the potential for}} failure in a cryogenic mechanism affecting all Spitzer instruments, it was required that any focus correction be made in a set of moves directly from the initial to the desired setting. The task of determining the required focus moves fell to IRAC (Infrared Array Camera), the instrument most affected by and sensitive to <b>defocus.</b> <b>To</b> determine the focus directly from examining images at a fixed focus, we developed two methods, "Simfit " and "Focus Diversity" (W.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop methods {{to use a}} linear optical model to capture the field {{dependence}} of wavefront aberrations in a nonlinear optimization-based phase retrieval algorithm for image-based wavefront sensing. The linear optical model is generated from a ray trace model {{of the system and}} allows the system state to be described in terms of mechanical alignment parameters rather than wavefront coefficients. This approach allows joint optimization over images taken at different field points and does not require separate convergence of phase retrieval at individual field points. Because the algorithm exploits field diversity, multiple defocused images per field point are not required for robustness. Furthermore, because it is possible to simultaneously fit images of many stars over the field, {{it is not necessary to}} use a fixed <b>defocus</b> <b>to</b> achieve adequate signal-to-noise ratio despite having images with high dynamic range.

40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether the ‘through-focus’ aberrations of a multifocal and accommodative intraocular lens (IOL) implanted patient {{can be used to}} provide rapid and reliable measures of their subjective range of clear vision. Methods: Eyes that had been implanted with a concentric (n = 8), segmented (n = 10) or accommodating (n = 6) intraocular lenses (mean age 62. 9 ± 8. 9 years; range 46 - 79 years) for over a year underwent simultaneous monocular subjective (electronic logMAR test chart at 4 m with letters randomised between presentations) and objective (Aston open-field aberrometer) defocus curve testing for levels of defocus between + 1. 50 to - 5. 00 DS in - 0. 50 DS steps, in a randomised order. Pupil size and ocular aberration (a combination of the patient’s and the defocus inducing lens aberrations) at each level of blur was measured by the aberrometer. Visual acuity was measured subjectively at each level of <b>defocus</b> <b>to</b> determine the traditional defocus curve. Objective acuity was predicted using image quality metrics. Results: The range of clear focus differed between the three IOL types (F= 15. 506, P= 0. 001) as well as between subjective and objective defocus curves (F= 6. 685, p= 0. 049). There was no statistically significant difference between subjective and objective defocus curves in the segmented or concentric ring MIOL group (P> 0. 05). However a difference was found between the two measures and the accommodating IOL group (P< 0. 001). Mean Delta logMAR (predicted minus measured logMAR) across all target vergences was - 0. 06 ± 0. 19 logMAR. Predicted logMAR defocus curves for the multifocal IOLs did not show a near vision addition peak, unlike the subjective measurement of visual acuity. However, there was a strong positive correlation between measured and predicted logMAR for all three IOLs (Pearson’s correlation: P< 0. 001). Conclusions: Current subjective procedures are lengthy and do not enable important additional measures such as defocus curves under differently luminance or contrast levels to be assessed, which may limit our understanding of MIOL performance in real-world conditions. In general objective aberrometry measures correlated well with the subjective assessment indicating the relative robustness of this technique in evaluating post-operative success with segmented and concentric ring MIOL...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{describe}} some {{features of}} contrast adaptation as induced by imposed {{positive or negative}} <b>defocus.</b> <b>To</b> study its time course and selectivity for {{the sign of the}} imposed defocus. MethodsContrast adaptation, CA (here referred to as any change in supra-threshold contrast sensitivity) was induced by presenting a movie to the subjects on a computer screen at 1 m distance for 10 min, while the right eye was defocused by a trial lens (+ 4 D (n= 25); − 4 D (n= 10); − 2 D (n= 11 subjects). The PowerRefractor was used to track accommodation binocularly. Contrast sensitivity at threshold was measured by a method of adjustment with a Gabor patch of 1 deg angular subtense, filled with 3. 22 cyc/deg sine wave grating presented on a computer screen at 1 m distance on gray background (33 cd/m 2). Supra-threshold contrast sensitivity was quantified by an interocular contrast matching task, in which the subject had to match the contrast of the sine wave grating seen with the right eye with the contrast of a grating with fixed contrast of 0. 1. Results(1) Contrast sensitivity thresholds were not lowered by previous viewing of defocused movies. (2) By wearing positive lenses, the supra-threshold contrast sensitivity in the right eye was raised by about 30 % and remained elevated for at least 2 min until baseline was reached after about 5 min. (3) CA was induced only by positive, but not by negative lenses, even after the distance of the computer screen was taken into account (1 m, equivalent to + 1 D). In five subjects, binocular accommodation was tracked over the full adaptation period. Accommodation appeared to focus the eye not wearing a lens, but short transient switches in focus to the lens wearing eye could not be entirely excluded. ConclusionsTransient contrast adaptation was found at 3. 22 cyc/deg when positive lenses were worn but not with negative lenses. This asymmetry is intriguing. While it may represent an epiphenomenon of physiological optics, further experiments are necessary to determine whether it could also trace back to differences in CA with defocus of different sign...|$|E

We evaluated {{the response of the}} guinea pig eye to Fresnel-type lenses incorporating two different powers. Methods. : A total of 114 guinea pigs (10 groups with 9 – 14 in each) wore a lens over one eye and interocular differences in refractive error and ocular dimensions were measured in each of three experiments. First, the effects of three Fresnel designs with various diopter (D) combinations (− 5 D/ 0 D; + 5 D/ 0 D or − 5 D/+ 5 D dual power) were compared to three SV lenses (− 5 D, + 5 D, or 0 D). Second, the ratio of − 5 D and + 5 D power in a Fresnel lens was varied (50 : 50 compared with 60 : 40). Third, myopia was induced by 4 days of exposure to a SV − 5 D lens, which was then exchanged for a Fresnel lens (− 5 D/+ 5 D) or one of two SV lenses (+ 5 D or − 5 D) and ocular parameters tracked for a further 3 weeks. Results. : Dual power lenses induced an intermediate response between that to the two constituent powers (lenses + 5 D, + 5 D/ 0 D, 0 D, − 5 D/+ 5 D, − 5 D/ 0 D and − 5 D induced + 2. 1 D, + 0. 7 D, + 0. 1 D, − 0. 3 D, − 1. 6 D and − 5. 1 D in mean intraocular differences in refractive error, respectively), and changing the ratio of powers induced responses equal to their weighted average. In already myopic animals, continued treatment with SV negative lenses increased their myopia (from − 3. 3 D to − 4. 2 D), while switching to SV positive lenses or − 5 D/+ 5 D Fresnel lenses reduced their myopia (by 2. 9 D and 2. 3 D, respectively).

Fresnel lenses, incorporating positive or plano power with negative power, can slow ocular growth, suggesting that such designs may control myopia progression in humans. School of Optometr...|$|E
40|$|Holographic {{data storage}} allows the {{simultaneous}} {{search of an}} entire database by performing multiple optical correlations between stored data pages and a search argument [1, 2]. We have recently developed fuzzy encoding techniques for this fast parallel search and demonstrated a holographic data storage system that searches digital data records with high fidelity [2]. This content [...] addressable retrieval {{is based on the}} ability to take the two [...] dimensional inner product between the search page and each stored data page. We show that this ability is lost when the correlator is <b>defocussed</b> <b>to</b> avoid material oversaturation [3], but can be regained by the combination of a random phase mask and beam confinement through total internal reflection. Finally, we propose an architecture in which spatially multiplexed holograms are distributed along the path of the search beam, allowing parallel search of large databases...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a conceptual {{design for a}} spectrometer designed specifically for characterizing transiting exoplanets with space-borne infrared telescopes. The design adopting cross-dispersion {{is intended to be}} simple, compact, highly stable, and has capability of simultaneous coverage over a wide wavelength region with high throughput. Typical wavelength coverage and spectral resolving power is 1 - 13 micron with a spectral resolving power of ~ a few hundred, respectively. The baseline design consists of two detectors, two prisms with a dichroic coating and microstructured grating surfaces, and three mirrors. Moving parts are not adopted. The effect of defocusing is evaluated for the case of a simple shift of the detector, and anisotropic <b>defocusing</b> <b>to</b> maintain the spectral resolving power. Variations in the design and its application to planned missions are also discussed. Comment: 22 pages, 8 figure...|$|R
