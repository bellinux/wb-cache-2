5|$|In Russia and {{the other}} nations of the former Soviet Union, golden jackals are {{considered}} furbearers of low quality because of their sparse, coarse, and monotonously colored fur. Jackal hairs have very little fur fiber; therefore, their pelts have a flat appearance. The jackals of Asia and the Middle East produce the coarsest pelts, though this can be remedied during the <b>dressing</b> <b>process.</b> Elburz in northern Iran produces the softest furs. Jackal skins are not graded to a fur standard, and are made into collars, women's coats, and fur coats. During the 1880s, 200 jackals were captured annually in Mervsk and in the Zakatal area of the Transcaucasus, with 300 jackals being captured there during 1896. In this same period, a total of 10,000 jackals were taken within Russia and their furs sent exclusively to the Nizhegorod fair. In the early 1930s there were 20,000–25,000 jackal skins tanned annually in the Soviet Union, but these could not be utilized within the country, and so the majority were exported to the United States. Commencing from 1949, they were all used within the Soviet Union.|$|E

50|$|After 1850 {{the small}} and {{scattered}} stamp mills and ore washeries were replaced by central ore dressing plants. The basic steps - coarse crushing - manual separation - sieving - jigging - fine crushing - table work and slime washing - remained much the same. The process was increasingly mechanised and perfected. In 1905 the most modern ore dressing plant in Germany went into operation in Clausthal using the gravity <b>dressing</b> <b>process.</b> It was located near the Ottiliae Shaft {{on the site of}} the old central ore processing plant of 1872. It employed up to 650 workers and processed all ore from the Clausthal and Zellerfeld pits until 1930. A change occurred in the 1920s with the introduction of the froth floatation in Bad Grund and later in Lautenthal. This technique enabled the required production of metal concentration without manual pre-sorting and a much higher yield. The flotation process was steadily developed during the 20th century and was used right up to the end of vein mining in the Upper Harz in 1992.|$|E

50|$|The mining {{jurisdiction}} and the tithes {{that had}} been granted in 1235 to the Brunswick Welfs and enfeoffed in 1296 to the knights of the Gowische were {{taken over by the}} Sechsmannen in 1356 and then from them to the town council. In 1359 the Goslar Mining Law was passed. As a consequence of this development, the council sought in 1360 to resolve the drainage issue in order to reactivate the mine that had now almost come to a standstill. In 1407, 1418 and 1432, the council tried, in association with foreign investors and various master miners, to drain the pits. In the years 1453-1456 Claus von Gotha achieved partial success with the Heinzenkunst a water wheel designed to lift and empty a chain of water buckets. By 1471 mining had recovered {{to such an extent that}} the council introduced new charges for the trades and ended up buying all the shares from the mine's owner.

40|$|AbstractThe <b>dressing</b> <b>process</b> {{is among}} the five basic {{activities}} of daily life that define the degree of autonomy and independence of an individual. Self-sufficiency is historically recent as a status symbol, since {{only at the end}} of the nineteenth century royalty and wealthy people are no longer assisted during the <b>dressing</b> <b>process.</b> In the 1970 s, the focus in fashion is indisputably youth, leaving aside everyone with symptoms incompatible with this youthful and healthy stereotype. Thus, the <b>dressing</b> <b>process</b> becomes essential for the maintenance of autonomy and social sustainability of individuals with some functional limitation. In this paper, we present a kinesiological analysis of the movements performed during the <b>dressing</b> <b>process</b> and identify the main difficulties experienced by twenty-six musculoskeletal patients. The movements required to put on different garments and parts of garments – i. e., dresses, tops, coats, collars, sleeves – as well as to fasten them and the variation of the implicated movements with reference to their position were directly observed and recorded. Among the main results obtained, we verified that, for the sampled target population, it is more difficult to perform movements with bigger ROM and gross motor skills than those requiring fine motor skills; also that the change of position of fastenings can make the <b>dressing</b> <b>process</b> easier, since they help combining two stages of the process – i. e., adjustment and fastening. Among the possible conclusions, we infer that maintaining autonomy is essential for the social sustainability of individuals with musculoskeletal pathologies. In association, the inclusion of users in the development of design products using a UCD process is imperative to enhance the products suitability for the end-user and it is also a means of social inclusion...|$|E
40|$|Loss {{of ammonia}} (NH 3) {{as a result}} of {{intensive}} N fertilization, especially due to agronomic practices in South China, is not well characterized. To investigate mechanisms and characteristics of NH 3 volatilization after urea application, an on-line monitoring system, with 30 -min data resolution, was used to study vegetable and rice fields from January 2009 to September 2010. Ammonia emissions and concurrent meteorological conditions were monitored for up to 20 days after fertilization in 12 experiments. Standard recovery test results indicated that the on-line measurement system was both stable and accurate. The NH 3 emission factors (EFs) related to broadcast (soil surface) basal dressing and top dressing to Brassica rapa L were 23. 6 % and 21. 3 %, respectively. The NH 3 EFs from holing basal dressing and broadcasting top dressing for lettuce were 17. 6 % and 24. 0 %, respectively. The NH 3 EFs for early rice in parallel broadcast basal <b>dressing</b> <b>process</b> were 10. 7 % and 14. 2 %, while in parallel top <b>dressing</b> <b>process</b> were 24. 0 % and 22. 6 %, respectively. The NH 3 EFs for late rice were 15. 4 % and 21. 0 % in parallel broadcasting basal <b>dressing</b> <b>process,</b> while 13. 2 % and 17. 6 % in parallel top <b>dressing</b> <b>process.</b> Emission of NH 3 from vegetable and rice fields occurred mainly in the first 2 - 3 weeks after fertilization. Ammonia emission flux was positively correlated with air temperature and soil temperature in the majority of the experiments. Relationships between NH 3 emissions and humidity, soil moisture or wind speed were explored, which were not consistent among all tests. Ammonia emission in vegetable and rice fields was primarily associated with temperature. High-resolution data, such as those gathered in the current investigation, will contribute to a more thorough quantitative understanding of the relationship between fertilizer application, environmental conditions, and NH 3 volatilization which, in turn, will improve the accuracy of atmospheric modeling on local, regional and global scales.

Due to {{the large}} {{difference}} in thermal properties of the resin and the abrasive grits, the laser-assisted dressing technology is of great interest for grinding wheel preparation.

40|$|AbstractPerformance of {{grinding}} operation {{is influenced by}} a variety of factors amongst which <b>dressing</b> <b>process</b> is the most important. Through the <b>dressing</b> <b>process,</b> the grinding wheel topography is produced. This affects, in turn, directly the grinding forces, workpiece surface quality and grinding wheel wear. This research aims to develop appropriate dressing strategies for small abrasive wheels in internal cylindrical grinding. For this purpose, three different dressing rollers, including an electroplated, a vitrified bond form roller and a cup-dresser, with four different grinding wheels, two CBN and two corundum wheels, were experimented. The studies on the ground surface roughness values and grinding forces prove the validity of the Schmitt-diagram in internal cylindrical {{grinding operation}}s. When up-dressing, a finer workpiece surface was achieved as compared to the case of down-dressing. This is associated with higher grinding forces which are caused by the finer grinding wheel surface. Further investigation was carried out on the wear rate of CBN grinding wheels. However, no measurable wear was seen up to a specific material removal volume of 9700 mm 3 /mm...|$|E
