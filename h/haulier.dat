25|$|The {{operation}} was launched from a farmhouse in Dundalk {{about a mile}} south of the border. The initial plan {{was to have a}} lorry transport the majority of the 19-man raiding party. The majority were armed with Thompson submachine guns as well as small arms, grenades and burglary tools. When the lorry failed to arrive, however, they were forced to improvise and called a local <b>haulier</b> on the pretense of moving a herd of cattle. The <b>haulier,</b> once he arrived, was forced into a tent and his vehicle stolen. The raiders left in two groups with the smaller of the two travelling in a car. They were specifically tasked with taking over the guardroom. That afternoon, at around 3:00pm, the car drove through the barracks' gate. As the men held up the guardroom, one of the raiders took the place of the sentry. This man, having spent some time in the Irish equivalent on the British Territorial Army, was able to convincingly march up and down the gate.|$|E
40|$|The European Commission has {{for some}} time {{indicated}} a desire to remove the remaining restrictions on cabotage. Such liberalization is expected to result in significant changes on some domestic road transport markets. The Scandinavian markets are among these and the local hauilers fear that the lower wages of Easter European <b>hauliers</b> will leave them out of business. In this thesis a scenario of full cabotage liberalization is assumed. Representatives from associations with interest within the Scandinavian road transport markets has been approached with a qualitative survey on carrier selection criteria. Respondents are asked to determine {{the importance of the}} criteria, as well as the relevance to the competition between Scandinavian and Eastern European <b>hauliers.</b> Finally they are asked to assess whether the advantage of each criterion lies with Scandinavian or Eastern European <b>hauliers.</b> The qualitative orientation of the survey is achieved though justification and follow up questions. Reliability of pickups and deliveries is still regarded the most important criteria. Also competitive prices received a high rating. It is concluded that the significant price difference between Scandinavian and Eastern European <b>hauliers</b> will benefit Eastern European <b>hauliers</b> considerably in the competition for the simple “from A to B” shipments. For more complicated shipments, entailing a higher level of service, communication and supply chain integration, the local <b>hauliers</b> are expected to stand their ground...|$|R
40|$|Small <b>hauliers</b> {{enterprises}} {{are ever}} more requested {{to work with}} very fragmented freights {{that have to be}} delivered in a continuously decreasing time. Besides, their monitoring capabilities are not compliant with the market requests, that asks for continuous freight updates. Small <b>hauliers</b> are still not able to efficiently monitor their trucks and to organise their freights so {{that it is possible to}} optimise the load composition, reducing costs and increasing quality. Thus, it seems to be necessary a certain degree of collaboration with other small <b>hauliers</b> in order to gain the necessary business competitiveness. We here describe a “Virtual Fleet" WEB based service where small and independent <b>hauliers</b> share some resources (trucks) in order to reduce time wastes and costs. They can asks for goods delivery or declare their free resources to the Virtual Fleet. A WWW site collects the requests/declaration and computes the optimal plan to be proposed to the Virtual Fleet and negotiated among <b>hauliers.</b> Zadanie pt. „Digitalizacja i udostępnienie w Cyfrowym Repozytorium Uniwersytetu Łódzkiego kolekcji czasopism naukowych wydawanych przez Uniwersytet Łódzki” nr 885 /P-DUN/ 2014 zostało dofinansowane ze środków MNiSW w ramach działalności upowszechniającej nauk...|$|R

25|$|If {{this move}} was {{intended}} to free the Wemyss Estate coal masters from their constraints it failed, for the North British Railway continued to be the sole <b>haulier</b> for coal from any distance, and Leven Harbour was unsatisfactory, and not easily reached by rail {{from many of the}} East Fife pits. Several other small harbours were developed, but this too failed to resolve the problem, and in any case numerous new pits had been opened remote from the existing railway. In May 1874 a Committee of coalmasters discussed building their own line to the developing Methil Dock, a little west of Leven. Nothing came of this discussion at first, but in 1878 a definite scheme was produced to connect Buckhaven with Thornton. Thornton was chosen as the junction because of the convenience of bringing coal from Dunfermline.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{concerns}} of the engineer Nicholas Whiteley about the likely hazards of trying to reclaim Horsey Island, the scheme went ahead, with two schemes being put out to tender, one for embankments around Horsey Island and the other for the construction of the new cut and the embankments on Braunton Pill. Calls for subcontractors, 200 navvies and a <b>haulier</b> to move 60,000 yards of stone from Braunton Down and other quarries were made in October 1854. There were some financial difficulties, and vandalism on the Heanton embankment in 1855. The upper section of the new cut was constructed through clay, but the lower section was though sand, which provided significant difficulties. The channel was lined with clay, with the base covered in gravel, and pumps were required to operate continuously to enable the work to proceed. Despite the problems, the works were finished within the three-year timescale, and costs of £13,394 were slightly under the budget price.|$|E

The track used edge rails, in which the wagon wheels had flanges for guidance (as opposed to a plateway, where plain wheels run on the flat of an L-shaped plate) so that the wagons were specific to railway use, and the company hired wagons to the <b>hauliers.</b> Whishaw recorded that there were 270 wagons in use on the system, each weighing about 24 cwt (1200 kg); the horses in use belonged to the coal proprietors, not the railway itself. Wagon rental to <b>hauliers</b> accounted for 8.4% of the company's revenue in the first seven years.|$|R

40|$|Intermodal line-trains {{operating}} in corridor network designs are regularly promoted {{a means for}} intermodal transport to compete on transport costs and time with all-road transport for distances shorter than 500 km. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to identify existing drivers and barriers to the usage of time and cost competitive intermodal in the decision making process of road <b>hauliers</b> who in many cases make the modal choice, i. e. deciding whether to outsource long-distance haulage to rail as an alternative to producing road haulage itself. This paper addresses the complexity of the mode choice that is often stressed in mode choice literature but more seldom explained. It looks into the potential of using an intermodal line-train for the long-distance transport of consolidated cargo between a forwarder’s terminals. In a multiple case study, the operations of four <b>hauliers</b> contracted by two forwarders in Sweden for the long-distance transport on two domestic routes (Göteborg – Malmö and Örebro – Stockholm) are assessed. In semi-structured interviews with four <b>hauliers</b> and two forwarders the drivers and barriers in the mode choice process for a modal shift are analysed. The results indicate that consolidated cargo is generally suitable for intermodal transport, but for outsourcing the long-distance haulage to rail the road <b>hauliers</b> face significant obstacles. The main barriers are a vehicle fleet that is not adapted for rail transport as well as small transport volumes and time-intensive terminal access that do not allow efficient PPH. Hence, in the current industry structure the modal shift potential for consolidated cargo is limited. New business models may be needed to reach transport volumes that allow efficient PPH operations, which in turn may lead to reduced business for road <b>hauliers...</b>|$|R
