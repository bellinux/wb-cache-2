5|$|In January 1884, the {{distinguished}} conductor Hans von Bülow brought the Meiningen Court Orchestra to Kassel and gave two concerts. Hoping {{to escape from}} <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the theatre, Mahler unsuccessfully sought a post as Bülow's permanent assistant. However, {{in the following year}} his efforts to find new employment resulted in a six-year contract with the prestigious Leipzig Opera, to begin in August 1886. Unwilling to remain in Kassel for another year, Mahler resigned on 22 June 1885, and applied for, and through good fortune was offered a standby appointment as conductor at the Royal Deutsches Landestheater in Prague by the theatre's newly appointed director, the famous Angelo Neumann.|$|E
5|$|In March 1989, he {{was sold}} to Hull City for £200,000 (at the time a Hull record). This move reunited him with manager Eddie Gray. Leeds spent the money they {{received}} {{from the sale of}} Swan on bringing Gordon Strachan in from Manchester United. Leeds would go on to win the league title in 1991–92 under Wilkinson, with Strachan playing a large part in the success. However Swan and Hull did not find success; Gray used Swan in defence, and lost <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the summer following a run of just one win in twelve games.|$|E

5|$|In the 1996–97 season, {{even the}} {{turnover}} {{rate of the}} Swales years was surpassed, with five managers (three permanent appointments and two caretakers) taking charge of first team affairs {{during the course of}} the season. The third of these was Steve Coppell, the shortest serving manager in the club's history, who resigned on ill health grounds after 32 days as manager. The final of the five, Frank Clark, saw out the season but did not last much longer, losing <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> February 1998 with the club on the brink of relegation to the third tier of English football. Joe Royle was unable to prevent relegation, but subsequently achieved successive promotions to restore top flight status, though relegation a year later resulted in his sacking.|$|E
5|$|Kennan {{found it}} {{difficult}} to perform <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> Belgrade. President Josip Broz Tito and his foreign minister, Koča Popović, began to suspect that Kennedy would adopt an anti-Yugoslav policy during his term. Tito and Popović considered Kennedy's decision to observe Captive Nations Week as an indication that the United States would assist anticommunist liberation efforts in Yugoslavia. Tito also believed that the CIA and the Pentagon were the true directors of American foreign policy. Kennan attempted to restore Tito's confidence in the American foreign policy establishment but his efforts were compromised by a pair of diplomatic blunders, the Bay of Pigs Invasion, and the U-2 spy incident.|$|E
5|$|Leon Czolgosz {{was born}} in Detroit, Michigan, in 1873, the son of Polish immigrants. The Czolgosz family moved several times as Paul Czolgosz, Leon's father, sought work {{throughout}} the Midwest. As an adult, Leon Czolgosz worked in a Cleveland factory until he lost <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> a labor dispute in 1893. Thereafter, he worked irregularly and attended political and religious meetings, {{trying to understand the}} reasons for the economic turmoil of the Panic of 1893. In so doing, he became interested in anarchism. By 1901, this movement was feared in the United States—New York's highest court had ruled that the act of identifying oneself as an anarchist {{in front of an audience}} was a breach of the peace. Anarchists had taken a toll in Europe by assassinating or attempting assassinations of a half-dozen officials and members of royal houses, and had been blamed for the 1886 Haymarket bombing in Chicago.|$|E

Meanwhile, her brother Fritz accepted a position at the Research Institute for Mathematics and Mechanics in Tomsk, in the Siberian Federal District of Russia, after losing <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> Germany, and was subsequently executed during the Great Purge.|$|E
5|$|On 29 August 1945, MacArthur {{was ordered}} to {{exercise}} authority through the Japanese government machinery, including the Emperor Hirohito. MacArthur's headquarters was located in the Dai Ichi Life Insurance Building in Tokyo. Unlike in Germany, where the Allies had in May 1945 abolished the German state, the Americans chose to allow the Japanese state to continue to exist, albeit under their ultimate control. Unlike Germany, {{there was a certain}} partnership between the occupiers and occupied as MacArthur decided to rule Japan via the Emperor and the {{most of the rest of}} the Japanese elite. The Emperor was a living god to the Japanese people, and MacArthur found that ruling via the Emperor made <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> running Japan much easier than it otherwise would have been.|$|E
5|$|On August 18, 2007, Anderson gave an {{interview}} in which he admitted to using steroids when he was performing on the independent wrestling scene, stating that he had quit using them in November 2005 to comply with WWE's Talent Wellness Program, implying that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the promotion was worth more than extra muscle mass. 12 days later, on August 30, his statements were shown to be incorrect when he, along with nine other WWE wrestlers, were named in a Sports Illustrated article as having received performance-enhancing drugs in direct non-compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Anderson received anastrozole, somatropin, and testosterone between October 2006 and February 2007.

5|$|The cast filmed {{the pilot}} in 1987. Papps' casting was {{announced}} {{ahead of the}} series debut. The series first aired on 17 January 1988 on the Seven Network. Frank was the first character to appear, although a Police officer (Bruce Venables) spoke {{the first piece of}} dialogue. Frank was played by Bradley Pilato in the scene, which was set in 1978 as a young Frank tries to escape from the Police officer. The series then switches to 1988, where Frank is one of five foster children alongside Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson), Steven Matheson (Adam Willits), Lynn Davenport (Helena Bozich) and Sally Fletcher (Kate Ritchie). Tom loses <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> the city and moves the Fletcher family to the town of Summer Bay.|$|E
5|$|The {{municipality}} {{gave the}} necessary permissions for construction in December 1997, but {{required that the}} club finance the upgrades, which the club could not afford. Kjell Ove Johansen, CEO of Bodø/Glimt's operating company, quit <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> November 1998 in protest against the mayor's and councilors' negative attitude and lack of trust towards Bodø/Glimt regarding the venue plans. On 27 January 1999, the municipal council passed a resolution allowing the venue {{to be sold to}} the club for NOK7.9 million, with the official take-over date being 1 May. In addition, the company would pay NOK5.5 million to the municipality at a later date, after the venue had become profitable.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the bridge}} {{remained}} in service for another 21 {{years as a}} free crossing, the Delaware River Joint Toll Bridge Commission constructed a brand new bridge at the Portland-Columbia. The new toll bridge was constructed in 1953 for $4 million (1953 USD, equal to $ today), but the toll was only one quarter (equal to $ today), like the former price of the Darlington's Bridge. Darlington, who had retired from <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>in</b> Orange in 1950, was alive and was in disbelief. The next April, the Toll Bridge Commission went ahead and dismantled the bridge made useful by Darlington, which was fought by several legal actions. The bridge ceased operations on April 3, 1954, being demolished soon after. The covered bridge at Columbia was destroyed during Hurricane Diane the next August. Just before the demolishing of the Darlington's Bridge, the approach on the New Jersey side had been renumbered to State Highway Route 163, which remains in condition from when the bridge was in use.|$|E
