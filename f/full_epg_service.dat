40|$|Intracellular {{punctures}} by aphid stylets {{appear as}} potential drop (pd) waveforms in DC electrical penetration graph (EPG) recordings. We used a dual-EPG device that recorded in one channel the ‘full EPG’ with R-plus emf-components (i. e., the usual DC EPG) and concurrently {{in a second}} channel the ‘R-EPG’ with R-components only. The circuit of the latter channel was an optimised amplitude modulation (AM) version derived from early (before 1990) AC systems. We also made some ‘emf-EPG’ recordings using a separate high input resistance ‘emf-amplifier’ sensitive to emf-components only. The intracellular pd waveforms have previously been divided into three subphases, and we aimed to distinguish and separate these subphases more accurately by the dual-EPG recordings than with the normal <b>full</b> <b>EPG</b> only. In this study, we temporarily distinguished five subphases (a–e), but unequivocal distinction {{of only a few}} of these appeared possible, in spite of the information coming from the two signals. The lack of clearly separable features in R-EPG signals often provided serious difficulties in pd recognition without the concurrent <b>full</b> <b>EPG,</b> but once located, only subphase II- 2 features were clear and supported the II- 2 data from the <b>full</b> <b>EPG.</b> Consequently, we could not distinguish subphases of complete pd waveforms better with additional R-EPG information during cell punctures by Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae). In Brevicoryne brassicae (L.) (Hemiptera: Aphididae), however, distinguishing II- 2 subphases in the <b>full</b> <b>EPG</b> was sometimes a problem. Our detailed dual-EPG observations showed some waveform continuity from halfway into the II- 1 subphase (start of the newly recognised subphase ß) {{until the end of the}} pd, with a strong but variable emf origin. This waveform tended to overrule other subphase waveforms in B. brassicae more than in A. gossypii and Myzus persicae (Sulzer) (Hemiptera: Aphididae). Subphase waveforms in <b>full</b> <b>EPGs</b> were especially difficult to recognise when pd periods had been interrupted in a virus inoculation experiment and additional R-EPG information could then be useful. This inoculation experiment showed again that only the first subphase (II- 1) contributes to virus (Cucumber mosaic virus) inoculation by A. gossypii. In B. brassicae, the benefit of concurrent R-EPG information in such virus experiments is presently under further investigation. Apart from this special application to virus experiments, we do not recommend the routine use of the dual-EPG device. Furthermore, we do not advocate the distinction of more than the previously recognised three intracellular pd subphases as a feasible option in future studies. Analysis of EPGs with concurrent R-EPGs requires substantially more analysis work without yielding consistently useful additional insights. This confirms earlier dual-EPG results from thrip...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{information}} on plant penetration activities by pear psylla Cacopsylla pyri L.

The electrical penetration graph technique or (<b>full)</b> <b>EPG</b> may relevantly contribute to this knowledge. C. pyri EPG waveforms were characterized on basis of amplitude, frequency, voltage level, and electrical origin. Additionally, stylet tracks and the putative location of stylet tips in the plant tissue were histologically related to EPG waveforms by light and transmission electron microscopy observations after stylectomy. More than one waveform occurred in the same tissue: PA, PB, PC 1 and PC 2 were all detected in the mesophyll, and PE 1 and PE 2 were both recorded in the phloem. Waveform PE 1 was always preceded by transient waveform PD, as previously described in other psyllids.

40|$|European {{pear psylla}} Cacopsylla pyri L. (Hemiptera Psyllidae) {{is one of}} the worst pests of pear (Pyrus communis L.) in Europe. We {{investigated}} probing behaviour in adults and nymphs of C. pyri by <b>full</b> <b>EPG</b> on a psylla-resistant pear selection, NY 10353. Concerning stylet probing behaviour on the plant surface, the results showed no significant differences between the resistant selection and the susceptible cultivar Bartlett, and no differences were also detected for epidermis and mesophyll resistance in the same conditions. For mesophyll/phloem, no differences were found in adults. However, in nymphs, weak resistance factors (longer stylet penetration and mesophyll salivation) were detected in the resistant selection. In phloem, EPG data indicate strong resistance factors in NY 10353, especially for nymphs and summer-form adults (longer time before the first phloem ingestion and a lower duration of each phloem ingestion event). No prolonged (> 10 min) phloem ingestion was performed by nymphs and adults in the resistant selection. The results support the hypothesis that NY 10353 resistance factors are located in the phloem sap and cause high C. pyri nymph mortality: this could be useful as a basis for further investigations of resistance mechanisms at the metabolic, chemical and genetic levels...|$|R
