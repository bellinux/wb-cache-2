25|$|The {{initiative}} to FUNN {{was taken by}} Rolf Skår, {{who was at the}} time chief executive officer of Norsk Data. On 18 February 1987 he contacted the Ministry of Trade and Industry and proposed that an <b>information</b> <b>superhighway</b> be built throughout the country based on independent computer centers. ND intended to be the driving force, but had support from the NTA and NTNF. Skår's demands were that ND would be allowed to use tax money via the District Tax Act and that these would be permitted used in areas that ND did not operate in. The subsidies would be used to purchase computer manufactured by Norsk Data. Part of Norsk Data's motivation was that the tax legislation was such constructed that companies could, within given regulations and limits, receive tax breaks by investing in non-central regional districts. Norsk Data could therefore channel back part of its taxes by using it in given areas.|$|E

Next, there are questions about whether demand-pull technological progress is also expected to reduce costs in the long run and to improve quality of service. Egan reminds us that some stakeholders will gain and some will lose during the 1990 s. The regulatory policies adopted in the coming years will influence the pace and pattern of investment in advanced public communication networks in the USA.

Although the basic formalism is quite general, information theory was initially developed in the context of telephonic communication through copper cable, and dealt mostly with a linear propagation channel, as exemplified by Shannon’s famous formula for the capacity of a channel (Table 1) with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN). Such a channel is defined by a linear relationship between the output time series Y(t) and input X(t) through the relation Y(t) = X(t) + N(t), where N(t) is a Gaussian noise process with a flat power spectrum. All three processes are assumed to be bandlimited with a bandwidth W. The capacity of this channel is given by C=W log 2 (1 +S/N), where S and N are the signal and noise powers, respectively...|$|R

40|$|Our {{purpose is}} to {{highlight}} an overlooked impact of transportation improvements [...] the ways improvements stimulate innovation {{and the development of}} technologies. Social and economic progress is then achieved through the use of new technologies. Does consideration of technological impacts clarify understandings of transportation improvements? Using IVHS as a case at point, we will treat that question after providing a classification of impacts and discussing the mechanisms yielding impacts. Although recognizing that there are many factors involved, we will highlight technology as the engine of economic and social progress. We regard technologies as ways of doing things embodied in human skills, products, processes and institutions. The topic seems timely. Such recent initiatives as the Oresund bridge in Malmo-Copenhagen, high speed rail and Intelligent Vehicle Highway Systems (IVHS) all beg impact questions.
