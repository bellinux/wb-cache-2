40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{multicast}} protection {{scheme based on}} a dual-homing architecture where each destination host is connected to two <b>edge</b> <b>routers.</b> Under such an architecture, the two paths from {{the source of the}} multicast session to the two <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> provide certain protection for the data traffic from the source to the destination host. Two problems are associated with the proposed dual-homing multicast protection scheme. One is to calculate the individual survivability for a destination host that is connected to two <b>edge</b> <b>routers.</b> The other is to assign two <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> for each destination host such that the total survivability is maximized for the multicast session subject to the port number constraint of <b>edge</b> <b>routers.</b> We propose an optimal algorithm to solve the first problem and a heuristic algorithm to solve the second problem. Through simulations, we show that the proposed heuristic algorithm achieves performance close to the calculated lower bound. © 2004 IEEE...|$|R

5|$|By 2003, Juniper had diversified {{into three}} major router applications: core <b>routers,</b> <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> and routers for mobile traffic. Juniper's first major {{diversification}} from core routers {{was when it}} entered the market for <b>edge</b> <b>routers,</b> by acquiring the e-series product family (originally known as ERX) through the purchase of Unisphere in 2000. By 2002, both Cisco and Juniper had increased their focus on <b>edge</b> <b>routers,</b> because many ISPs had built up abundant bandwidth at the core. Several improvements to Juniper's software and its broadband aggregation features were released in late 2003. At this time, Juniper had the largest market-share (52%) of the broadband aggregation market. In 2003, Juniper entered the market for cable-modem termination systems with the G-series product family after the acquisition of Pacific Broadband. The product family was discontinued later that year.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A {{new type}} of {{resource}} discovery mechanism is proposed for simulation oriented data grid. By introducing distributed resource brokers at <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> of each domain, a majority of resource discovery queries can be processed solely by resource brokers at <b>edge</b> <b>routers,</b> instead of accessing remote global resource broker. The response time and network overhead of resource discovery is reduced and system scalability is enhanced. Experiment {{results show that the}} proposed resource discovery mechanism is feasible. ...|$|R

40|$|Furies {{provides}} a control framework for scalable, efficient admission control and traffic policing. Furies leverages {{the knowledge of}} traffic demand distributions between ingress-egress pairs and the network topology within an ISP in making admission control decisions. We propose to aggregate admitted ows for policing at <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> instead of monitoring individual flows. Furies achieves this by assigning a unique flow-identifier to every admitted ow based on its ingress and egress point. As a result, the amount of states maintained by the <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> can be reduced from O(n) to O(p n), where n {{is the number of}} admitted flows, while core routers are stateless. Simulation results show that we can successfully detect a majority (64 - 83 %) of the malicious ows with virtually zero false-alarms without maintaining per-flow state at the edge. Our implementation demonstrates that Furies adds minimal processing overhead to <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> and can be incrementally deployed. ...|$|R

5000|$|Routers: Routers and {{switches}} must be positioned such {{that no single}} piece of network hardware controls all network access to a given host.

5000|$|In general, {{edge devices}} are {{normally}} routers that provide authenticated access (most commonly PPPoA and PPPoE) to faster, more efficient backbone and core networks. The trend {{is to make}} the edge device smart and the core device(s) [...] "dumb and fast", so <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> often include Quality of Service (QoS) and multi-service functions to manage different types of traffic. Consequently, core networks are often designed with switches that use routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) or Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) for reliability and scalability, allowing <b>edge</b> <b>routers</b> to have redundant links to the core network. Links between core networks are different, for example Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routers often used for peering exchanges.|$|R
