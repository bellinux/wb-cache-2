5|$|The game marked Middle Tennessee's {{first ever}} win over an ACC opponent, {{although}} they had come close in Charlottesville the year prior, when Virginia made a go-ahead <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> eightseconds remaining. It was Middle Tennessee's fourth win against an opponent from a Bowl Championship Series (BCS) conference. The other three all came against Vanderbilt.|$|E
5|$|Michigan's {{offensive}} {{leader in}} the game was Howard, who totaled 98 rushing yards on 20 carries and 40 receiving yards on a game-high four catches. Shea added 51 receiving yards on three catches. Minnesota totaled only 102 yards of total offense, and Byron Evans was responsible for 82 of them (17 carries for 82 yards). Michigan overcame two turnovers inside Minnesota's 5-yard-line and a missed <b>field</b> <b>goal.</b> <b>With</b> the win, Michigan had prevailed in 28 of its last 30 games against Minnesota.|$|E

5|$|On the game's next play, Chapman {{passed the}} ball deep, {{toward the end}} zone. Though the pass fell incomplete, a game {{official}} called a 15-yard pass interference penalty against NC State. This moved {{the ball to the}} NC State 23-yard line and forced Tech kicker Chris Kinzer to attempt a potentially game-winning 40-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> four seconds remaining. Though NC State coach Dick Sheridan called a timeout in an attempt to ice Chris Kinzer, the kick sailed through the uprights and Virginia Tech won a 2524 victory as time expired.|$|E
5|$|On {{their first}} {{offensive}} {{possession of the}} second half, and on the third consecutive offensive play, Alabama scored on a long touchdown play. This time Julio Jones ran the ball 56-yards for a touchdown to extend the Alabama lead to 27–3. Shelley scored Alabama's final points in the fourth on a 28-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> State scoring their lone touchdown late on a 27-yard Chad Bumphis touchdown reception from Tyler Russell. The Alabama defense allowed only 149 rushing yards, registered five sacks and two interceptions.|$|E
5|$|The Steelers {{concluded}} their primetime schedule {{with their}} only Thursday night {{game of the}} season.

5|$|Games between FBS and FCS teams {{typically}} {{result in}} lopsided victories for the FBS team, and the Appalachian State–Michigan game {{was not expected}} to be an exception. The predicted outcome was a lopsided victory for Michigan. Las Vegas sportsbooks did not give a betting line. The game was also the first to be broadcast on the then-new Big Ten Network. It began with a strong first half for Appalachian State, who held a 28–17 lead {{at the end of the}} half. Michigan regained the lead at 32–31 in the fourth quarter, but Appalachian State took the lead for a second time on a short <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> 26seconds left. The Mountaineers blocked a game-winning field goal attempt from Michigan at the end of regulation to secure a 34–32 win.|$|E
5|$|James {{continued}} to be a key defensive player for the Browns in 1949, when the team won another AAFC championship behind a staunch defense and an offense led by quarterback Otto Graham and fullback Marion Motley. The AAFC dissolved after the season, however, and the Browns moved to the NFL. Cleveland's first year in the NFL was the best of James's career: he intercepted nine passes, setting a club record that stood until 1978. The team finished the season with a 10–2 record and beat the Los Angeles Rams to win the NFL championship. James made an interception in the game. He also held the ball for placekicker Lou Groza on the game-winning <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> under a minute to play.|$|E
5|$|NC State, {{needing to}} score, {{drove down the}} field and kicked a go-ahead 33-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> 7:12 {{remaining}} in the game. After a failed possession, Tech was forced to punt the ball away, allowing NC State to run down the clock. The Virginia Tech defense eventually forced a stop, giving the Tech offense one final {{chance to win the}} game. With 1:53 on the clock and beginning from their own 20-yard line, the Hokies drove 57 yards to the NC State 23-yard line. There, kicker Chris Kinzer successfully kicked a 40-yard field goal as time expired to give Virginia Tech a 25-24 win.|$|E

5|$|Alabama {{brought the}} score to 20–14 {{late in the}} third after a 20-yard Trent Richardson {{touchdown}} reception from Greg McElroy. The Arkansas lead was then cut to three after a 36-yard Jeremy Shelley <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> just over 6:00 remaining in the fourth. After Robert Lester intercepted a Mallett pass and returned it to the 12-yard line, Ingram took the next three snaps that culminated in a one-yard touchdown run to take a 24–20 lead. After a late Dre Kirkpatrick interception, McElroy gained a first down on a fourth and inches quarterback sneak to seal the victory for the Crimson Tide. Ingram led the team with 157 yards rushing on 24 carries and Richardson finished with 85 yards on eight carries. Kirkpatrick led the defense with nine tackles and an interception. For his five-tackle, two-interception performance, Robert Lester was recognized as both the FWAA/Bronko Nagurski National Defensive Player of the Week and the SEC Defensive Player of the Week. The victory improved Alabama's all-time record against the Razorbacks to 11–8 (14–7 without NCAA vacations and forfeits).|$|E
5|$|Clemson {{returned}} Georgia Tech's kickoff to its 43-yard line, {{but despite}} the good field position, Clemson was unable to take advantage. On the first play of the drive, Clemson quarterback Parker threw an interception to Georgia Tech defender Dominique Reese, who went out of bounds at the Tech 45-yard line. Georgia Tech's offense returned to the field at that point and began driving down the field. In two plays, Tech passed the 50-yard line. In six more, it penetrated the Clemson 10-yard line. Once there, however, the Yellow Jackets' drive stalled. Three consecutive penalties against Georgia Tech pushed the Yellow Jackets back 20 yards, and Tech was unable to score a touchdown or gain a first down after that setback. Kicker Blair again returned to the field and scored a 49-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal.</b> <b>With</b> 5:35 remaining in the first half, Georgia Tech extended its lead to 13–7.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} the team's poor 2003 record, Johnson {{retained}} Edwards as head coach and extended his contract through 2007. With a healthy Pennington at quarterback, the Jets began their season at 5–0 {{for the first time}} and then lost two of their next three games. During the team's second meeting with the Bills, Pennington suffered a tear in his rotator cuff that caused him to miss three starts. Pennington returned in a 29–7 rout of the Houston Texans. The team struggled toward the end of the regular season, winning only one of its final four games. Despite a final-game loss to the St. Louis Rams, the Jets reached the playoffs. The team traveled to San Diego to play the Chargers in the wild card round and upset them 23–20 on a Doug Brien field goal in overtime. The win sent the Jets to the divisional round against the 15–1 Pittsburgh Steelers. The Jets again took their opponent to overtime, as Brien missed a <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> two minutes remaining and the score tied. He missed a second field goal in overtime. Pittsburgh kicker Jeff Reed proved more accurate, and the Steelers beat the Jets, 20–17.|$|E

5|$|Michigan {{defeated}} Purdue 36–14. Purdue scored {{its only}} {{points of the}} first half when Caleb TerBush threw a 48-yard touchdown pass to Gary Bush. Michigan dominated the game following the Purdue score. The Wolverines responded to Purdue's touchdown with a touchdown of their own, a two-yard run by Denard Robinson, which was its fifth consecutive opening drive touchdown. In the second quarter, Michigan scored a safety when Mike Martin tackled Caleb TerBush in the end zone. A few minutes later, Michigan's Brendan Gibbons kicked a 37-yard field goal. Michigan added more points with a two-yard touchdown run by Fitzgerald Toussaint. The final score {{of the first half}} was a 22-yard Michigan <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> no time left on the clock. After the intermission, Michigan scored the only points of the third quarter when Fitzgerald Toussaint scored his second touchdown of the game, this time on a 59-yard rush. The teams traded scores in the final quarter. First Michigan's Michael Shaw ran in a touchdown from 37 yards out, which was followed by Purdue's Robert Marve throwing a 19-yard touchdown pass to O.J. Ross. With the win, Michigan's record against Purdue improved to 43–14.|$|E
5|$|Playing in a torrential downpour, the Buccaneers {{scored the}} first shutout in {{franchise}} history to clinch their first playoff berth and the NFC Central title. The Chiefs were held to a franchise-low 80 yards of total offense. Despite the rain, Ricky Bell claimed that the field had better traction than the dry field they had played on the week previously in San Francisco. Bell carried the ball 39 times for 137 yards in such bad weather that the game had to be played under lights. The Buccaneers lost four previous scoring opportunities to a fumble, two interceptions, and a fumbled snap on a field goal attempt. Shut out {{of the end zone}} on three tries with first-and-goal from the 9-yard line, the Buccaneers brought Neil O'Donoghue in to kick what would be the winning <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> 8:50 remaining. Tampa Bay would hold the ball for all but four plays {{for the rest of the}} game. The Chiefs players gave the Buccaneers little credit after the victory, saying that the AFC was superior to the NFC and that the Buccaneers would never have won the AFC West.|$|E
5|$|The Bucs won {{the coin}} toss and deferred. The Bears opened {{the game with}} a hurry-up offense and gained a first down, but were {{eventually}} forced to punt. Tampa Bay also later punted, but regained the ball at the Bears' four-yard line after a blocked punt; Jeremiah George escaped LaRoy Reynolds to block Pat O'Donnell's punt and Howard Jones recovered. The Bucs converted the play into a four-yard touchdown run by Martin. Both teams later punted on their next drives, Jay Cutler's screen pass was deflected and intercepted by William Gholston, who returned the pick to the Bears' 15-yard line, but Jacquies Smith's facemask penalty nullified the play. Afterwards, Ka'Deem Carey scored on a one-yard touchdown run to tie the score. On Tampa's next drive, Martin was stripped by Harold Jones-Quartey, and the fumble was recovered by John Timu; the takeaway led to Robbie Gould's 26-yard field goal. The Bucs were later forced to punt again with two minutes left in the first half, and the Bears offense drove 40 yards to the nine, where Gould kicked a 27-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> eight seconds left. Winston kneeled to end the half. On the first drive of the second half, the Bucs scored when Winston threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Charles Sims, who took advantage of Tracy Porter to score. Although the Bears punted on their next drive, they regained possession after Christian Jones and Lamarr Houston's blitz forced Winston to throw to Charles Sims, where Jones-Quartey pulled the ball away. The Bears eventually punted, but got the ball back when Pernell McPhee stripped Martin, with the fumble being recovered by Timu. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Cutler's play-action pass to Carey resulted in a one-yard touchdown. The Bucs punted on their next series, and Gould kicked a 50-yard field goal to increase the score to 23–14; Connor Barth later missed a 52-yard field goal wide left, leading to Gould's 39-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal.</b> <b>With</b> one second left in the game, Winston threw a 43-yard touchdown pas to Austin Seferian-Jenkins, and on the ensuing onside kick, Cameron Meredith recovered as time expired.|$|E

5|$|The Ravens {{opened the}} game with Ray Rice gaining a 47-yard run, his longest of the year {{up to that point}} (his {{previous}} highest in 2013 was 14 yards), which led to Rice's 1-yard run with 9:58 in the first. The Ravens added to the score with Justin Tucker's 52-yarder, bringing the score to 10–0. With 4:51 left in the first quarter, the game was suspended due to inclement weather, which included a tornado watch, which was eventually elevated to a tornado warning. Fans were ordered to evacuate the stands and enter the covered concourses, while the teams returned to the locker rooms. The evacuation marked the first time Soldier Field had an evacuation since the stadium's opening in 1921. The game resumed play at 3:25p.m. ET, after a 1-hour, 53 minute-delay. In the second quarter, Robbie Gould kicked a 20-yard field goal, and eventually, rookie defensive end David Bass escaped a chop block by Rice and intercepted Flacco, scoring on a 24-yard return and tying the game. The Ravens eventually scored on Torrey Smith's five yard touchdown catch, and after Flacco had a pass intercepted by Jon Bostic, Gould ended the half kicking a 46-yarder. After a scoreless third period, Matt Forté caught a 14-yard pass from McCown and scored with 10:33 in the fourth, the Bears finally taking the lead 20–17. Now behind by three, the Ravens engineered an 82-yard drive to Chicago's 2-yard line, but Rice failed to score twice, and a botched snap from Gino Gradkowski slowed down the Ravens, and Flacco's pass towards Smith was overthrown. As a result, the Ravens resorted to a 21-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> three seconds in regulation to force overtime. In overtime, Flacco's pass for Tandon Doss fell incomplete, and the Ravens punted to the Bears. McCown then completed a 43-yard pass to Martellus Bennett, and Gould kicked the game-winning 38-yard <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> 8:41 remaining to win the game 23–20, which lasted five hours, 16 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The Trojans next {{faced the}} Stanford Cardinal. Though the Cardinal {{were the last}} team to beat the Trojans at home back in 2001, they were {{slightly}} struggling under first–year head coach Walt Harris and quarterback Trent Edwards with a 4–3 record. The Trojans jumped to an early lead with a LenDale White rushing touchdown, a Reggie Bush rushing touchdown, a Leinart touchdown pass to White, and a Mario Danelo <b>field</b> <b>goal.</b> <b>With</b> a 24-point lead, Leinart threw two more touchdown passes before Edwards passed for the first Cardinal touchdown of the game. Leinart's fourth touchdown pass came with threeminutes left in the half to give the Trojans a 44–7 half-time lead. The Cardinal scored on a rush in the third quarter, and with many starters out the Trojans answered {{in the fourth quarter}} with their own rushing touchdown. The Cardinal ended the scoring with 23seconds remaining with their second rushing touchdown of the game to bring the score to 51–21. With the win, the Trojans extended their winning streak to 31games.|$|E
5|$|The game {{kicked off}} at 8:32pm Eastern Standard Time, and Virginia Tech scored first, {{converting}} the its first possession into {{on a field}} goal. Virginia Tech added another field goal in the second quarter, but Michigan scored a touchdown {{in the final minute}} to take a 7–6 lead, and then recovered a Virginia Tech fumble on the ensuing kickoff. Michigan kicked a field goal as time expired in the first half to take a 10–6 lead. Michigan converted its first possession of the second half into a touchdown to take a 17–6 lead, but Virginia Tech added a field goal to narrow the lead to 17–9. In the fourth quarter, Virginia Tech scored a touchdown to narrow Michigan's lead to two points, and then converted a two-point conversion to tie the game. Michigan responded with a field goal, but Virginia Tech tied the game with a <b>field</b> <b>goal</b> <b>with</b> two seconds remaining. In overtime, Virginia Tech appeared to score the go-ahead touchdown, but the call on the field was overturned upon video review. On the next play, Virginia Tech missed a crucial field goal. Michigan converted its field goal opportunity to win the game 23–20 in overtime.|$|E
