40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{studies were}} {{performed}} {{in order to}} test for the presence of a cephalic inhibition of migrating motor complexes (MMC) in domestic turkeys. Birds were implanted with two or three strain gauge transducers on the ileum and subjected to one of two different protocols. In Study 1 recordings of ileal motility were made under three feeding conditions: fed, fasted, and with feed pans in place before the birds but covered with plexiglass. In Study 2 the birds were either fasted, fasted with feed pans returned as soon as an MMC registered in the most orad gauge, or fasted with a minor disruption in the room (to simulate <b>feed</b> <b>pan</b> return) as soon as an MMC registered in the most orad gauge. Data from trials involving plexiglass plates did not differ significantly from data from fasted birds, and both differed significantly from the data from fed birds. Likewise, no significant differences were seen among any of the three feeding categories of Study 2. The present data show that neither the anticipation of eating, nor the presence of feed in the mouth and esophagus seem to directly influence the initiation or propagation of ileal MMC contractile activity in turkeys, supporting the view that extrinsic neural pathways are not responsible for the inhibition of the MMC.

40|$|Factors that {{influence}} the localized abundance and distribution of lesser mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer), in litter of two compacted earth-floor broiler houses in subtropical Australia were studied using various experimental manipulations. Numbers of lesser mealworms substantially increased inside caged areas and under uncaged empty <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> placed in open areas of the houses. These populations {{were found to be}} localized and independent of chicken-feed, manure, and high beetle populations that normally occur under existing <b>feed</b> <b>pans.</b> Substantial horizontal movement of larvae to under <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> was recorded. Placing metal barriers around these pans significantly restricted this movement. In almost all treatments, lesser mealworms typically peaked in numbers {{during the middle of the}} flock time. This temporal pattern of abundance also was observed under pans within barriers, where relatively low insect numbers occurred, but it was not observed in uncaged open areas (where chickens had complete access). It is likely that larvae do not establish in open areas, but fluctuate in numbers as they either move to refuges away from chickens or suffer high rates of mortality. In these refuges, larvae peak in numbers and then leave the litter environment to pupate in the earth floor before the end of the flock time. This behavior might be exploited for management of lesser mealworm by targeting applications of control agents...|$|R
40|$|Distributions {{of lesser}} mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), in litter of a {{compacted}} earth floor broiler house in southeastern Queensland, Australia, were studied over two flocks. Larvae were the predominant stage recorded. Significantly low densities occurred in open locations and under drinker cups where chickens had complete access, whereas high densities were found under <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> and along house edges where chicken access was restricted. For each flock, lesser mealworm numbers increased at all locations {{over the first}} 14 d, especially under <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> and along house edges, peaking at 26 d and then declining over the final 28 d. A life stage profile per flock was devised that consisted of the following: beetles emerge from the earth floor {{at the beginning of}} each flock, and females lay eggs, producing larvae that peak in numbers at 3 wk; after a further 3 to 4 wk, larvae leave litter to pupate in the earth floor, and beetles then emerge by the end of the flock time. Removing old litter from the brooder section at the end of a flock did not greatly reduce mealworm numbers over the subsequent flock, but it seemed to prevent numbers increasing, while an increase in numbers in the grow-out section was recorded after reusing litter. Areas under <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of lesser mealworms in the broiler house occurred in these locations.

40|$|International audienceInvestigations were {{undertaken}} to identify causes for {{the occurrence of}} high levels of the zootechnical feed additive nicarbazin in broiler liver at slaughter. The first investigation on 32 commercial broiler flocks involved sampling and analysis for nicarbazin (as dinitrocarbanilide, DNC) in liver from birds during a 3 - 10 day period after withdrawal of nicarbazin from their feed and prior to commercial slaughter. DNC residues in liver samples of broilers scheduled as being withdrawn from nicarbazin for ≥ 6 days ranged from 20 to > 1600 μg/kg (the specified withdrawal period for nicarbazin is 5 days and the JECFA MRL is 200 μg/kg liver). Further on-farm investigations on 12 of these flocks, {{selected on the basis}} of the feeding system in use and the levels of DNC residues determined in liver, identified issues in feed management contributing to elevated residues in broiler liver. A significant correlation (0. 81, p < 0. 01, n = 10) between DNC residues in liver samples and in feed samples from the <b>feeding</b> <b>pans</b> was observed. The second investigation on 12 commercial broiler flocks involved sampling and analysis for DNC in liver samples and feed samples from <b>feeding</b> <b>pans</b> and from the feed mill at the three thinnings of birds for commercial slaughter. In the case of one flock, a clear relationship between nicarbazin in feed from the feed mill (10. 5 mg/kg DNC), in feed from the <b>feeding</b> <b>pans</b> (6. 6 mg/kg DNC) and in liver (583 μg/kg DNC) at first thinning (9 days scheduled withdrawal from nicarbazin) was observed. Such a clear relationship was not observed in other cases, particularly at second and third thinnings, pointing to re-exposure of birds to nicarbazin late in the flock production cycle, probably from the litter. Guidelines outlining best farm practice to eliminate nicarbazin residues in poultry have been published in booklet and poster format for broiler producers and deal with feed system cleaning, feed bin management, feed deliveries, feed usage and records...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of feeder adjustment on growth performance of growing and finishing pigs. Both experiments were conducted at a commercial swine research facility in southwest Minnesota. In Exp. 1, a total of 1, 170 barrows and gilts (PIC, initially 129. 0 lb) were used in a 70 -d study. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 5 treatments with 9 replications per treatment. The treatments were feeder settings of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, based on settings at the top of the STACO stainless steel dry feeders. Pigs were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets. From d 0 to 28, pigs fed from feeders with increasing feeder openings had increased (linear, P 0. 10) any growth performance traits. Overall (d 0 to 70), pigs fed from feeders with increasing feeder openings had increased (linear, P 0. 18) ADG or F/G. In Exp. 2, a total of 1, 250 barrows and gilts (PIC, initially 77. 3 lb) were used in a 69 -d study to determine the effect of feeder setting and diet type on growth performance of growing and finishing pigs. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 treatments with 8 replications per treatment. The treatments were arranged in a 3 × 2 factorial with main effects of STACO stainless steel dry feeder setting (1, 3, or 5) and diet type (corn-soybean meal- or by-product-based (15 % DDGS and 5 % bakery by-product). Overall (d 0 to 69), there were no feeder setting × diet type interactions (P > 0. 31) for growth performance. Diet type did not affect (P > 0. 75) growth performance. Increasing feeder openings increased ADG (qu-adratic, P 0. 08) F/G with the best F/G at feeder set-ting of 3.

40|$|In Australia, {{the lesser}} mealworm, Alphitobius diaperinus (Panzer) (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae), {{is a common}} insect pest of earth floor broiler houses, where it often occurs in large numbers in the bedding {{material}} or litter that is used on the floors. Lesser mealworms are reservoirs for several avian pathogens, parasites and food borne diseases. In addition, larvae damage broiler house structures by actively tunnelling into insulation and earth floors. Despite being a common and ubiquitous broiler house pest in Australia, until now, little was known of its ecology in earth floor broiler houses or its susceptibility to registered broiler house insecticides. To determine {{the factors that influence}} their localised abundance and distribution in litter, populations of lesser mealworm in several earth-floor broiler houses in sub-tropical Queensland were intensively sampled, experiments were undertaken and life tables constructed. Lesser mealworm larvae were the predominant stage recorded in all litter samples. Life table parameters used stage durations based on a mean broiler house temperature of 31. 3 °C. Within the broiler houses, substantial horizontal movement of larvae in litter to under <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> was recorded and this behaviour was supported by life table analyses, which showed atypical lesser mealworm survivorship, suggesting movement by all larval ages. This movement results in large and significant aggregations of larvae under <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> and along house edges, where chicken access is restricted. Significantly lower larval densities occurred in open locations and under drinker cups, where chickens had complete access. Small larvae appeared to aggregate predominately {{at the beginning of the}} flock but continued to move during most of the flock time. In addition, the experimental manipulations in open areas of the broiler house showed that lesser mealworms substantially increased in number inside caged areas without <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> and under uncaged empty <b>feed</b> <b>pans.</b> Lesser mealworms under similar empty <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> but enclosed with metal barriers did not increase in the same manner; these barriers significantly restricted their movement. Aggregated populations of lesser mealworms were found to be localised and independent of chicken-feed, manure, and the normally high adult beetle numbers that occur under permanent existing <b>feed</b> <b>pans.</b> Total broiler bird weight in the brooder section during the flock time was considered a driving factor for larval movement, and together with relatively high litter temperatures, a potential source of mortality across larval stages. At almost all types of locations within a broiler house, including experimental treatment locations, numbers of lesser mealworms typically increased over the first 14 d of the flock time, especially in more protected areas such as under <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> and along house edges, peaked at ≈ 26 d, and then declined over the remainder of the flock time. In these protected areas or refuges, larvae peaked in numbers, and then left the litter environment to pupate in the earth floor prior to the end of the flock time. This behaviour seemed unrelated to density as the same temporal pattern of abundance was observed under pans within metal barriers, where much fewer insects occurred. It was not observed in uncaged open areas where chickens had complete access. As larvae move away from chickens to refuges, it is likely that populations fail to establish in open areas, but fluctuate in numbers and suffer high rates of mortality. Therefore a typical life stage profile in earth floor broiler houses consists of beetles that emerge from the earth floor at the start of each flock time, lay large numbers of eggs that produce larvae that peak in numbers at ≈ 21 d, and after a further 21 - 28 d leave the litter and pupate in the earth floor. These pupae produce adult beetles that begin to emerge prior to the end of the flock time. Removing and replacing litter in the brooder section at the completion of a flock time appeared to inhibit rises in numbers of lesser mealworms over the subsequent flock in the brooder section. In contrast, reusing litter in the grow-out section caused an increase in lesser mealworm numbers in the grow-out over the subsequent flock time. Areas under <b>feed</b> <b>pans</b> and along house edges accounted for 5 % of the total house area, but approximately half the estimated total number of lesser mealworms in the broiler house occurred in these locations. Because a high proportion of larvae move to under pan locations and aggregate, this behaviour could be exploited to better manage lesser mealworms by targeting applications of residual control agents at the commencement of the flock to areas under <b>feed</b> <b>pans,</b> which could maximize the efficiency of these agents, and in doing so, reduce the overall quantity of insecticide required to treat a broiler house. The most common practice used for management of lesser mealworm is the treatment of broiler house floors or bedding with insecticides. In Australia fenitrothion, cyfluthrin and spinosad are currently registered for broiler house application, and another insecticide, γ-cyhalothrin, is under consideration. Overall, the most commonly used insecticide throughout eastern Australia is the pyrethroid, cyfluthrin. Because of control failures using this chemical, resistance to cyfluthrin was suspected in Australian broiler farm populations of lesser mealworm. Consequently the responses of several field populations of beetles collected from broiler farms in different Australian states and an insecticide-susceptible reference population to cyfluthrin, spinosad and γ-cyhalothrin were measured in topical application bioassays. In addition, the susceptibility of six Australian broiler house beetle populations and the insecticide susceptible population to several pyrethroids (cyfluthrin, β-cyfluthrin, γ-cyhalothrin & deltamethrin) was measured to determine patterns of cross resistance. The importance of metabolic mechanisms of resistance in these field populations was investigated using similar assays and the synergist piperonyl butoxide. Beetle populations from eastern Australia were first tested with cyfluthrin and resistance (resistance ratios of up to 22 -fold at the LC 50) was found in almost all of them; with the degree of resistance in a given population directly proportional to the number of cyfluthrin applications it had received. Dose-mortality data showed that 0. 0007 % cyfluthrin (the LC 99. 9 of the susceptible population) could be used as a convenient discriminating dose to identify resistant populations. In addition, comparisons of cyfluthrin LC 50 values of three broiler populations and a susceptible population, collected and then assayed over a four year interval, indicated that values from all three broiler populations had increased over this time. For spinosad, comparisons of dose-response curves showed that all populations, including the insecticide-susceptible population, were equivalent in their response to spinosad, indicating no pre-existing spinosad resistance. Two of these field populations, including a resistant reference population, had confirmed cyfluthrin/fenitrothion-resistance, but showed no cross-resistance to spinosad. A discriminating concentration of 3 % spinosad (just above the highest recorded LC 99. 9 value of 2. 45 %) was set to separate resistant and susceptible individuals. For γ-cyhalothrin, baseline studies of beetle populations from most Australian states indicated that it was roughly twice as toxic as cyfluthrin, with a discriminating concentration of 0. 005 % γ-cyhalothrin chosen to detect any future changes in susceptibility. These same beetle populations were tested with the cyfluthrin discriminating dose to identify possible cross-resistance. Across all populations, there was a significant linear relationship between the γ-cyhalothrin LC 50 value and mortality induced by the cyfluthrin discriminating dose. In addition, repeat testing and regression analysis of specific beetle populations to γ-cyhalothrin showed that topical application was a very reliable and repeatable testing method. The γ-cyhalothrin study suggested that cyfluthrin can confer cross-resistance to γ-cyhalothrin in A. diaperinus, but the magnitude of this resistance is not predictable. The susceptibility of beetle populations to four pyrethroids with and without piperonyl butoxide showed that almost all populations, when compared to the reference susceptible population, demonstrated very low susceptibility to cyfluthrin, with some reduced susceptibility to β-cyfluthrin, deltamethrin and γ-cyhalothrin; cross-resistance patterns varied considerably between populations. Adding piperonyl butoxide had no effect on the susceptibility of the susceptible population to any of the insecticides, but it consistently increased the susceptibility of each of the five cyfluthrin-resistant populations to cyfluthrin, β-cyfluthrin and γ-cyhalothrin. The addition of piperonyl butoxide to deltamethrin had inconsistent effects on susceptibility. In general, adding piperonyl butoxide to the four pyrethroids did not completely restore susceptibility to these compounds in resistant populations, indicating the presence of other resistance mechanisms in addition to microsomal-monooxygenase and esterase based metabolic resistance mechanisms. The relative importance of these metabolic resistance mechanisms in each beetle population varied widely between pyrethroids, and the future addition of piperonyl butoxide to these pyrethroids might not necessarily improve their efficacy in the field. Following the laboratory toxicity testing of cyfluthrin and spinosad, field efficacy assessments of these two insecticides and diatomaceous earth, were made on two farms in south eastern Queensland. Diatomaceous earth is known to have insecticidal properties so it was chosen to assess its potential as a natural litter treatment on one farm. Insecticide treatments|$|R

40|$|Constant {{presence}} {{of at least}} one operator in livestock buildings for broilers would allow a perfect control of animal behaviour and, especially, deviations in feeding and drinking patterns, in the perspective of a high welfare status. However, as nowadays it is impossible for a farmer to be present in the farm all day long, automatic monitoring systems are required. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to introduce a system (eYeNamic) for automatic monitoring and analyzing broilers’ behavior in a farm. eYeNamic is a camera system introduced and produced by Fancom BV, a company operating in the field of automation of livestock facilities. It includes three cameras located on the ridge of the broiler house and able to monitor chickens’ behaviour twenty-four hours a day. Through eYeNamic it is possible to process the images and to obtain a measure of animals’ distribution and activity, which can be conceived as valuable indicators of animal welfare. The study presented in this paper was divided into several phases: data collection, images visualization, observation of the distribution and activity of the chickens, and statistical analysis of the observations. The analysis of correlation between the number of 14 days old broilers near the feeding line (manual counted) and the average occupation density measured with eYenamic indicates that the best conditions have occurred with a 50 cm by 75 cm area around each <b>feeding</b> <b>pan.</b> With reference to the drinking line, the best response was found in an area 50 cm wide and the whole drinking line long. For the activity behavior, there was no significant correlation between activity and number of chickens eating from all the pans: this confirms that broilers while eating reduce their activity. It was concluded from this study that eYeNamic is a good system to observe animal behavior and, especially, to take care of their drinking and eating behaviour. A satisfactory correspondence between eYeNamic remote and human observations depends on a correct definition of animals’ eating behaviour. In our case, this correspondence is established for the manual labeling, only if a broiler maintains its whole head inside the pan for a period lasting 20 seconds. In many cases the simple closeness to the pan or drinking line does not guarantee that a broiler is eating or drinking...|$|R

We tested experimentally whether chimpanzee rough grunts, which function to refer to food, are produced selectively, indicating voluntary control, and whether they are directed at specific individuals. These are prerequisites for a system capable of actively informing others about external events. We conducted a field playback experiment in which we presented silently <b>feeding</b> male chimpanzees, <b>Pan</b> troglodytes, with arrival pant hoots of a familiar group member. We found that subjects {{were significantly more likely to}} respond with food calls to the simulated arrival of an individual with whom the caller had a high rather than low level of friendship and where there was a large rather than small positive dominance rank difference between the individuals (i. e. caller was lower ranking). We concluded that chimpanzee food calls are not simply reflexive responses to food, but can be selectively directed at socially important individuals. Our findings are thus inconsistent with traditional views of primate vocalizations as inflexibly and indiscriminately produced. Instead, our results indicate that great apes can produce semantically meaningful calls in a highly selective, recipient-directed manner. Further research is needed to test whether chimpanzees use this flexible system to inform ignorant individuals about food, but the prerequisites to support this type of communication seem to be present...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) -University of Natal, 2002. The {{objective}} of this work {{was to determine the}} operating conditions which would maximise the crystallisation performance of continuous vacuum pans used in the sugar industry. The specific application investigated in detail is crystallisation of high grade product sugar (A-sugar) in a South African raw cane sugar factory. The optimisation studies are based on a detailed dynamic mathematical model of a continuous pan. Whilst this model is based on the published work of others, the selection of variables and the formulation of the equations have been structured to produce a modular model of an individual compartment with the minimum number of independent variables. The independent variables have also been selected to meet the requirements of both a state-space control formulation and those necessary for the dynamic programming technique of optimisation. The modular compartment models are linked together to model a multi-compartment pan and the steady state model is derived as a special case of the dynamic model. For the model to simulate the conditions in South African sugar factories adequately requires appropriate descriptions of sucrose solubility and growth kinetics. Given the limited applicability of published data, experiments were undertaken to determine these parameters. Sucrose solubility in impure solutions was determined in laboratory tests designed to approach equilibrium by dissolution at conditions approximating those during pan boiling. The dependence of crystal growth rate on the concentration of impurity present in the mother liquor was investigated in both laboratory scale and pilot scale batch pan boiling experiments. The primary dependence of crystal growth rate on the super-saturation driving force was determined by fitting the steady state model to results of tests on an industrial scale continuous pan. The dynamic programming technique was used in conjunction with the mathematical model to determine the operating conditions which maximise steady state crystallisation performance. Using the crystallisation parameters determined for South African conditions, this approach has shown that the conventional wisdom of running with high crystal contents in all compartments of continuous pans boiling A-massecuite is not optimum. Pans should operate at lower crystal contents in earlier compartments, only increasing to higher crystal contents towards the final compartment. The specific values depend on seed conditions, pan design and the solubility and growth kinetics. To reap the benefits of being able to determine the optimum steady state operating condition for a continuous pan, it is necessary to be able to achieve effective steady state operation under industrial conditions. This requires both a steady loading on the pan and effective control of the crystallisation conditions within the pan. To stabilise loading, a strategy has been developed which uses buffer tanks in an optimal way to damp out flow fluctuations. This strategy accommodates multiple buffer tanks in series without the amplification of disturbances that occurs with some of the simpler published techniques. The dynamic behaviour of absolute pressure control and compartment feed control were investigated in an industrial scale pan. This work has demonstrated the importance of high quality absolute pressure control and developed techniques for effective automatic tuning of <b>pan</b> <b>feed</b> controls. As part of this research, computer control systems were developed as tools to provide the appropriate monitoring and control of the experiments undertaken...|$|R
5000|$|Captain James Algernon Cloudesley Hook (voiced by Tim Curry) - The main {{antagonist}} of {{the series}} and Peter Pan's nemesis. As his name implies, James Hook {{is the head of}} his pirate crew. Although he's well known for his ruthless and nefarious nature, the Hook in this version is more complex and in many ways closer to the portrayal in Barrie's book. He's missing his right hand and has a sharp iron hook instead. References to Peter <b>Pan</b> <b>feeding</b> Captain Hook's hand to the crocodile is still intact. Rather thanthe traditional long black hair (or wig) and long moustache, this Hook is clean-shaven and has his white hair styled {{in the manner of a}} powdered wig. As the captain of the ship named [...] "The Jolly Roger" [...] he has a pirate crew and a parrot, named Short Tom. In contrast to his bumbling crew, Hook is very much the aristocrat, and is very well read and charming in a sinister way. He also is very good at playing a harpsichord, despite the loss of his hand. He usually expresses dissatisfaction about his crew ("Treasure hunt", [...] "The Hook and the Hat", [...] "A day at the fair"). However the same way he can see the advantages at one them, what he wants to make (sensible) use of ("Professor Smee", [...] "When Games become deadly", [...] "The Phantom Shaman", [...] "Pirate Boys, Lost Men"). He can get into trouble, where he not once is able to come out by himself ("Eternal Youth", [...] "River of Night"), but it can also happen, that he needs the help of Peter ("The Croc and the Clock", [...] "Three Wishes", [...] "Mardi Gras") or the others ("The Hook and the Hat", [...] "Pirate Shadows", [...] "Tootles and the Dragon", [...] "Slightly duped", [...] "Jules Verne Night", [...] "The Ruby", [...] "Hook the faithful son", [...] "The Pirate who came to dinner", [...] "A hole in the wall", [...] "Frau Brumhandel" [...] or [...] "The Letter"). He is immune to Neverland's magic ("A day at the fair", [...] "Frau Brumhandel" [...] or [...] "Curly's Laugh"), however can be affected by strange magic ("Three Wishes"). Two members of his Family are mentioned: his brother Patch, who owned his own Pirate Ship called [...] "The Rake", and his mother, who is referred to as having had some unfulfilled wishes about her son James and being already dead, where the only thing left of her memory being a portrait that Hook has in his cabin, but never is shown completely ("Hook's Mother's Picture", [...] "Eternal Youth", [...] "Friday the thirteenth" [...] or [...] "The Letter"), however it is strongly implied that she was hideously ugly ("Hook's Mother's Picture"). As generally having a very rude and cruel character he has a weakness for mothers, not only his own ("When Games become deadly" [...] or [...] "Hook the faithful son"), but also strange mothers ("The Letter") and can become sensitive, when he hears of her thoughts or feelings ("Eternal Youth" [...] or [...] "Hook the faithful son"). Insight to Hook's past is given in the episode [...] "Hook's Christmas", where it is shown that Hook and his brother were once partners in piracy. However, when Hook's fiance discovered that he was a pirate, she left him. Heartbroken and moody, Hook would later duel his brother for command of the ship, a fight that claimed the latter's left eye. Also, in [...] "Ages of Pan Episode One", Hook mentions that he served in the British Navy at some point in his life.|$|R
