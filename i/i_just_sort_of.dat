25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler from when I first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. I certainly use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
500|$|The band {{then took}} a lengthy break to compose more tracks for Parachutes. A few months later, it was {{arranged}} that Allison and the band meet at a rehearsal room to finally begin production on the band's debut album. [...] "They started up playing in the rehearsal room and they really weren't together at all. And I was very honest with them, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> said 'Look, this simply isn't good enough'". Allison adds, [...] "The interesting, the most significant thing that did occur out {{of the fact that}} we didn't end up starting the album on that day of the rehearsal was that Chris Martin had not written 'Yellow' by that time".|$|E

5000|$|Ringo Starr met {{songwriter}} Dean Grakal at a {{party on}} New Years Eve 1996, during which the pair had a discussion about songwriting, with Grakal proposing that they form a team with Mark Hudson, whom Starr had met years prior while Starr was working on Time Takes Time (1992). Starr spoke of the writing process {{in an interview with}} Billboard magazine: [...] "This is the first time Ive really been involved my record. Whereas before, <b>Id</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> pick out other peoples songs or songs other people had written that I thought were vaguely trying to say what I would have liked to say, on this, were really trying to say what I want to say, thank you." ...|$|R

500|$|Mudhoney {{recorded}} the song at Seattle's Reciprocal Recording studio in March 1988, {{three months after}} the band's formation. Producer Jack Endino was surprised by how noisy the sessions were and how dirty the band wanted the guitars to sound; [...] "for the most part, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> stood back and let them go at it". Guitarist Steve Turner said that the band selected two of their [...] "grungiest" [...] songs for the single. [...] "Sweet Young Thing Ain't Sweet No More" [...] was to be the A-side of the single and [...] "Touch Me I'm Sick" [...] the B-side before, in drummer Dan Peters's words, [...] "that all got flipped around".|$|E
2500|$|Closing track, [...] "Tomorrow's Food", was {{the first}} song written for the album. Einziger stated that the song was {{conceived}} in 2009 with Lee Hartney from The Smith Street Band and [...] "was written {{at a time when}} I didn’t know whether or not {{we were going to go}} back and start working on new music for a new album. I’d been off at Harvard for a while and Brandon was really focusing on painting and for a little while there we didn’t have all that much communication. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> wrote that guitar part, the chord progression and the changes and stuff and Brandon just sort of responded to it. We kind of just put it aside and then when we started working on new music for this album, I think we always knew that we wanted to record it in the studio and make it really great. But that actually was one of the last things that we did for this album." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{completing}} the tour for Midnite Vultures (1999), Beck and his fiancée, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Three weeks before Beck's 30th birthday, he discovered Limon {{had been having}} an affair with a member of Los Angeles band Whiskey Biscuit. Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks on Sea Change. He wrote most of the album's 12 songs in one week, but shelved them. [...] "Songs sit in my head for a while," [...] he told Time in 2002. [...] "I have dozens in there, songs from eight years ago that I've written but never recorded. After a while, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> decide to record them." [...] Beck also strayed from the songs to keep from talking about his personal life, as well as to focus on music and [...] "not really strew my baggage across the public lobby." [...] Eventually, however, he found the songs speak to an experience (a relationship breakup) that is common, and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called his frequent producer, Nigel Godrich.|$|E
25|$|I {{remember}} {{as a child}} {{that she had a}} drinking problem. She had difficulty coping with {{the ups and downs of}} the business… As a child, I thought, 'She has a drinking problem and she's an alcoholic.' That was very clear and I thought, 'Well, there's not much I can do. <b>I</b> can <b>just,</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> stand by and watch.' It's very difficult, seeing your mother, going through her emotional problems and drinking and then behaving in that manner… Her condition became quite bad.

Mays Black Music Heritage Award, 1995; University of Georgia Outstanding Alumna Award, 2000; and the Foot Soldier for Equal Justice (University of Georgia) Award. In {{light of this}} attention, she said, [...] "It wasn't in our {{vocabulary}} to think that people were good or bad because of their skin color, so <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> taken aback that it became a big issue later in my life." [...] On May 10, 2013 at the Spring Commencement Ceremony, Early was honored by the University of Georgia when President Michael F. Adams presented her with an honorary doctorate of laws degree. Early's honorary doctorate is only the 79th honorary doctoral degree conferred in UGA's history.|$|R
2500|$|Given {{that the}} band's {{background}} was exclusively in heavy music at that point, some band members experienced difficulties expanding their sound early on. In particular, Spruance noted that Mike Patton {{had to teach}} him to play the ska stroke for a performance at their high school talent show. Spruance later explained, [...] "Oh, what I remember was... this was our first... like, we had only done, uh, death metal up to that point. And so this was our first time trying to ever play ska. And I'd never played... on guitar, like, I'd never played... I didn't {{know how to do}} that skanking guitar shit at all. But Patton could do, like with one finger on the thread mark, he could do the, the rhythmic part of it pretty well. Like, he could... he taught me how to do it. So, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> awkwardly... I would fill in and make the chord and he actually played guitar, but would just kind of use it percussively. And we played these Camper Van Beethoven songs, and I don't... I dunno if we played The Specials, but that's what we were listening to." ...|$|E

6000|$|We talked {{pictures}} steadily till it {{was time}} to dress for dinner. At least, they did. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> sat around. Presently the subject of picture-robberies came up. Somebody mentioned the [...] "Monna Lisa," [...] and then I happened to remember seeing something in the evening paper, as I was coming down in the train, about some fellow somewhere having had a valuable painting pinched by burglars the night before. It was the first time I had had a chance of breaking into the conversation with any effect, and I meant {{to make the most of}} it. The paper was in the pocket of my overcoat in the hall. I went and fetched it.|$|E
40|$|Fundamental to oral fluency, pragmatic markers {{facilitate}} {{the flow of}} spontaneous, interactional and social conversation. Variously termed ‘hedges’, ‘fumbles’ and ‘conversational greasers’ in earlier academic studies, this book explores the meaning, function and role <b>of</b> well, <b>I</b> mean, <b>just,</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of,</b> like and you know in British English. Adopting a sociolinguistic and historical perspective, Beeching investigates how these six commonly occurring pragmatic markers are used {{and the ways in}} which their current meanings and functions have evolved. Informed by empirical data from a wide range of contemporary and historical sources, including a small corpus of spoken English collected in 2011 – 14, the British National Corpus and the Old Bailey Corpus, Pragmatic Markers in British English contributes to debates about language variation and change, incrementation in adolescence and grammaticalisation and pragmaticalisation...|$|R
5000|$|Weatherly later commented, [...] "This {{episode was}} so much fun to shoot. Cote de Pablo, who plays Ziva, came to me right before we were {{shooting}} the first scene where we kissed, and said, 'I've never kissed anyone on camera before.' I was expecting this timid little bird kiss, like a little peck, but she was like a lioness—she practically ate my head off! This is where TIVA (Tony+Ziva) started. We were told to really have fun with it, they wanted a sexy thing happening, and Cote delivered. <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> along for the ride. And let's be honest, three out of the four letters in 'TIVA' are from Ziva, so what is the 'T' then? The crucible, is it the cross? I don't think so." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Oh, with Debbie, we {{just have}} a lot of unsaid communication, a lot of non-verbal stuff goes on. I don't have to ask her much because she will always have the same conclusions", Stein said. Harry agreed: [...] "Most recently, {{there were a couple of}} lines in a song that he came up with, and then there were two more lines that had to be written, and I had already written them.

5000|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} solely by founding member Patrick Wilson, with Wilson noting, [...] "At some point, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> {{stopped trying to}} make Special Goodness a band and just said, 'I'm {{not going to be}} happy unless I do everything myself,' which is totally ironic because that's not really my personality." ...|$|E
5000|$|TNGHT first premiered the {{unfinished}} {{version of the}} track during BBC Radio 1Xtra's Diplo & Friends in late 2012, a time which he said was before the EDM-trap trend.

5000|$|Two {{nights before}} Holly's death, on January 31, 1959, 17-year-old Bob Dylan {{attended}} Holly's performance in Duluth. Dylan {{referred to this}} in his acceptance speech when he received the Grammy Award for Album of the Year for Time Out of Mind in 1998: [...] " ... when I was sixteen or seventeen years old, I went to see Buddy Holly play at Duluth National Guard Armory and I was three feet away from him ... {{and he looked at}} me.

When I pictured those dead women and {{children}} floating about in that pitiless, ice-cold water--well, at first <b>I</b> <b>just</b> felt a <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> nausea with life.

5000|$|By January 2002, {{the rest}} of the band were mainly {{recording}} demos that Albarn had started on a four-track and subsequently transferred into Logic with 13s in-house engineers Tom Girling, Jason Cox and assistant, James Dring. Hillier said that [...] "I dont usually work with an engineer, I usually do it all myself, so it was nice - especially nice to have Jason. Hes an awful lot more than an engineer, hes worked with the band for years, he knows 13 and the bands equipment inside out. By the end of the four weeks we had 17 songs - quite an astonishing work-rate considering that the band wont work past 6 pm when theyre in London." [...] Think Tanks fourth track, [...] "On The Way to the Club", in Albarns words, [...] "changed dramatically" [...] from the original demo. [...] "Only Hillier, myself and were in the studio ... <b>I</b> was <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> playing around and they were doing something else and the tune came out and the bit of the lyric, so <b>I</b> <b>just</b> went can you put a drum beat down really quickly.

5000|$|I didn't do {{any sport}} outside school, and I {{certainly}} didn't do any at university.

5000|$|Although Fisher hadn't {{played with}} the band since 1969's A Salty Dog, he stated at the time [...] "I felt that <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> slotted back into it, like it had only been like the day before ... so it's not so much déjà vu as just {{carrying}} on where we left off."

5000|$|Yellow Tanabe {{says that}} she uses {{reference}} books with pictures as inspiration for designs of ayakashi.

5000|$|Controversy erupted after {{director}} Bill Condon {{said there}} was a [...] "gay moment" [...] in the film, when LeFou briefly waltzes with Stanley, one of Gaston's friends. Afterwards in an interview with Vulture.com, Condon stated, [...] "Can <b>I</b> <b>just</b> say, I’m <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> sick of this. Because you’ve seen the movie—it's such a tiny thing, and it’s been overblown." [...] Condon also added that Beauty and the Beast features much more diversity than just the highly-talked-about LeFou: [...] "That was so important. We have interracial couples—this is a celebration of everybody's individuality, and that’s what’s exciting about it.” GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis praised the move stating, [...] "It is a small moment in the film, but it is a huge leap forward for the film industry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Precisely," [...] Aynesworth admitted. [...] "Ten years' {{absence from}} English life today {{means that you}} return to it an {{absolute}} and complete stranger.

5000|$|According to her {{housekeeper}} at the time, {{the events}} of the novel were dreamt by Lindsay successively. Several years after the publication of the novel, Lindsay would recount the experience of writing it as such: [...] "Picnic at Hanging Rock really was an experience to write, because I was just impossible when I was writing it. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>sort</b> <b>of</b> thought about it all night and in the morning I would go straight up and sit on the floor, papers all around me, and just write like a demon!" ...|$|E

I leaned over and I said, “I don’t understand: Why in the world would they get a Jew to direct a Catholic boys movie?” And the director—Michael Dinner I think was his name—was sitting right behind me. Laughs. And then it turned out that I’m part Jewish! My grandfather was Jewish.
