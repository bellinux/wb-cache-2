Returning to his farm, he saw Kehoe driving in the {{opposite}} direction, heading toward the school. [...] "He <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> waved his hand," [...] Ellsworth said.

500|$|Nesbitt {{returned}} to theatre acting in June 2005 {{when he appeared}} in David Nicholls' After Sun, a ten-minute-play performed {{as part of the}} Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow. He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In The Independent, Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: [...] "Nesbitt is cool. But I never felt that he was inside his role of a chap called Socrates [...] He <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
500|$|When Mickl {{arrived by}} train in Zagreb on 12 January, Kobe {{met him at}} the station and {{informed}} him that he was ready for Mickl to decide the time that an attack against Partisan forces besieging the NDH garrison at Ogulin near Karlovac should be launched. In response, Mickl <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> shook Kobe's hand, and according to Kobe, [...] "the spell was broken", and from that time on, Mickl and his chief of operations had a very good working relationship. The operation [...] involved a drive southwest from Karlovac between 13 and 16 January 1944 initially led by the 847th Infantry Regiment. In their first engagements with the Partisan 8th Division, the Croatian soldiers panicked and their German leaders were quickly wounded or killed, but Mickl went forward and ensured that his troops pressed home their attacks. On 16 January, Ogulin was relieved, but the advance was continued south to Skradnik, and villages in that area were also secured. When the bodies of those that had been killed were recovered, they were often found stripped of equipment and some were even found naked. This success in their first operation gave the inexperienced Croat soldiers greater confidence in themselves and their commanders.|$|E

2500|$|During January 1945 the Third Fleet {{attacked}} Formosa and Luzon, and {{raided the}} South China Sea {{in support of}} the landing of US Army forces on Luzon. At the conclusion of this operation, Halsey passed command of the ships that made up Third Fleet to Admiral Spruance on 26 January, whereupon its designation changed to Fifth Fleet. Returning home Halsey was asked about General MacArthur. [...] General MacArthur was not the easiest man to work with, and vied with the Navy over the conduct and management of the war in the Pacific. Halsey had worked well with MacArthur and did not mind saying so. [...] When a reporter asked Halsey if he thought General MacArthur's fleet (7th Fleet) would get to Tokyo first, the admiral <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> answered [...] "We're going there together." [...] Then seriously he added [...] "He's a very fine man. [...] I have worked under him for over two years and have the greatest admiration and respect for him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Greig {{was born}} to a Scottish {{immigrant}} father and a South African-born mother, and was educated at Queen's College, Queenstown, South Africa. Many former Sussex players had been recruited to coach the cricket team at Queen's College—during Greig's schooldays, Jack Oakes, Alan Oakman, Ian Thomson, Ron Bell, Richard Langridge and Mike Buss all came from overseas for off-season work. All of them noticed Greig's developing abilities which, after a first-class debut for Border Province in the Currie Cup, led to a trial at Sussex when Greig was 19. Greig's father helped him decide between university study or pursuit of the Sussex offer. [...] "He used to slam into me for not reading enough, for being generally immature. He {{would look at me}} sometimes and say 'Boy, when I was your age I was fighting a war', but in the end he <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> said: 'Go over to England for one year, one year mind, and see what you can do'".|$|E
2500|$|As {{they were}} going below, Francisco Portusach sailed across {{the bow of the}} Charleston in a {{whaleboat}} with the American flag at the topmast. A loud voice from the ship called, [...] "Frank, come on board." [...] Portusach looked up to the deck and saw Captain Hallett, a man whom he had known years before. The skipper of the whaleboat then went to the lee side of the cruiser and clambered aboard. When he reached the deck, he was surprised to find a reporter with whom he was acquainted, a representative of the San Francisco Chronicle. While the reporter and the old whaling captain were talking about old times, Lieutenant William Braunersreuther, the navigator, walked up to Portusach and demanded to know by what right he was hoisting the American flag at the topmast of the little boat. The Guam merchant merely <b>grinned</b> <b>and</b> replied the flag was being flown legally. The lieutenant promptly requested proof, and Portusach produced American naturalization papers from an inside coat pocket and handed them to the doubting Braunersreuther who looked at them and said, [...] "Well! Twenty-second of October, 1888, Chicago, Cook County, State of Illinois." [...] The navigator examined the document more thoroughly and requested Portusach to accompany him to visit Glass. The [...] "welcoming party" [...] had just departed for shore, so the two men entered the captain's cabin, and the lieutenant handed the naturalization papers to Glass who looked at them for a few moments. He had already heard from José Portusach that Francisco possessed some lighters and boats, so he greeted the merchant by inquiring if it was possible to obtain the use of two lighters and a boat to transfer coal from the City of Peking to the bunkers of the Charleston and offered to pay for the service. Portusach agreed to furnish the boats without compensation since he felt an obligation, as the only United States citizen on the island, to aid his country in time of war.|$|E
