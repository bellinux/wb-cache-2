5|$|A {{botanical garden}} is a {{controlled}} and staffed institution {{for the maintenance}} of a living collection of plants under scientific management for purposes of education and research, together with such libraries, herbaria, laboratories, and museums as are essential to its particular undertakings. Each botanical garden naturally develops <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> fields of interests depending on its personnel, location, extent, available funds, and the terms of its charter. It may include greenhouses, test grounds, an herbarium, an arboretum, and other departments. It maintains a scientific as well as a plant-growing staff, and publication is one of its major modes of expression.|$|E

5|$|The apothecaries' system {{often used}} the same ounces as the {{precious}} metals system, although even then the number of ounces in a pound could be different. The apothecaries' pound was divided into <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as Dioscorides and Galen, 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries' weights and the normal commercial weights were different, {{it was not always}} clear which of the two systems was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it. In old merchants' handbooks the former system is sometimes referred to as the pharmaceutical system, and distinguished from the apothecaries' system.|$|E

In addition to traditional police duties, the local police monitors the number of discount sales held by large stores (no more than two a year are allowed) and verify that, during summer holidays, at least one bakery is open in every neighbourhood. The national police has <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> unit for riot control and crowd control and security of public buildings, called the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS), a unit formed in 1944 right after the liberation of France.

25|$|The firsts to {{preserve}} the remnants began on 16 November 1973. At that time, the Junta Nacional de Educação (National Junta for Education) proposed the classification of the castle a Property of Public Interest. This was superseded on 6 March 2006, by the DRPorto, which proposed {{the establishment of a}} Special Protection Zone for the property, leading to the classification of the property as a Sítio de Interesse Público and incorporating it into <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>Special</b> Protection Zone on 10 January 2014 (Diário da República, Série 2, 7, Ordinance 20/2014).|$|E

25|$|The staple diet of Manipur {{consists}} of rice, fish, large varieties of leafy vegetables (of both aquatic and terrestrial). Manipuris typically raise vegetables {{in a kitchen}} garden and rear fishes in small ponds around their house. Since the vegetables are either grown at home or obtained from local market, the cuisines are very seasonal, each season having <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> vegetables and preparations. The taste {{is very different from}} mainland Indian cuisines because of the use of various aromatic herbs and roots that are peculiar to the region. They are however very similar to the cuisines of Southeast/East/Central Asia, Siberia, Micronesia and Polynesia.|$|E
25|$|Eilat is {{especially}} defended by <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> forces unit Lotar Eilat. Lotar Eilat is a reservist special forces {{unit of the}} IDF trained in counter-terrorism and hostage rescue in the Eilat area, which has taken part in many counter-terrorist missions in the region since its formation in 1974. The Lotar unit is composed solely of reservists, citizens who must be Eilat residents {{between the ages of}} 20 and 60, who are on call in case of a terrorist attack on the city. It is one of only three units in the IDF authorized to free hostages on its own command.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiative}} returned on April 9 for {{a second}} consecutive year. The format changed slightly from 2007; the episode aired as <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> on Idols regular Wednesday results night with an early start time of 7:30 p.m. EDT (when stations would've otherwise shown local programming), running for 152 minutes from the Kodak Theatre and the regular Idol stage. The results show aired separately that Thursday. Vignettes showing celebrities visiting impoverished areas in the United States as well as Africa were again shown in between performances. Producers hoped to exceed last year's $76 million raised. Again, proceeds went to children's charities in Africa and the United States.|$|E

25|$|Canton: {{smaller than}} the quarter, {{formally}} said to occupy one-ninth of the shield, though sometimes drawn smaller. The canton is often {{said to be the}} quarter's diminutive, but perhaps it should be treated as a subordinary in its own right as it fulfils heraldic functions not fulfilled by the quarter, and behaves according to <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> rules—as for example {{in the case of the}} canton on which baronets in the UK may display the badges of their 'rank', which is very rarely shown occupying such a large area as the upper left third of the field, and is usually much less and very often shown not as square but as a rectangle with its longer side vertical. Very occasionally a 'sinister canton' is found, on the shield's other side.|$|E
25|$|Such tension erupted almost immediately. Shortly before 1433 three priories in Valais, Tuscany, and Mantua were {{reformed}} by the preaching of Thomas Conecte of Rennes {{and formed}} the Congregation of Mantua, refusing {{to accept the}} mitigation of 1432. They instead insisted on a more severe monastic observance than that applied between 1247 and 1432. Under the Mantuan observance, entrance to the cloister was forbidden to outsiders, the friars were banned from being outside the convent without good reason, and money was distributed from a common chest. In 1443, they obtained a bull from Pope Eugenius IV which effectively declared the Mantua chapter independent {{of the rest of}} the Order, with <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> set of Constitutions and governed by its own vice prior general. Under the reconciliatory efforts of prior-general Blessed John Soreth (c. 1395–1471; prior-general 1451–71), however, the Mantuan congregation was brought closer to the main Carmelite order, such that in 1462 the Mantuans even accepted parts of the 1432 mitigation.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, Vidago, Melgaço e Pedras Salgadas {{along with}} the {{municipal}} council of Melgaço presented their candidature to PITER Projeto Integrado Turístico Estruturante de Base Regional (which supported the region of National Park of Peneda-Gerês), as a public-private company to proceed with recuperation and thermal spa and the springs in the region. In 200, Melgaço approved the remodelling and expansion of the spa. These initiatives lead to the 20 December 2002, petition to classify the thermals as a Imóvel de Interesse Municipal (Property of Municipal Interest), then reinforced on 9 March 2004 by moves by the DRPorto to open a process to classify the Thermal Park of Peso, later supported by the Vice-President of the IPPAR (12 October). In June 2005, the PITER program was prorogued. The attempts to classify the property continued on 31 May 2012, with a proposal by the DRCNorte to classify the park as a Monumento de Interesse Público (Monument of Public Interest) and fix it within <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>Special</b> Protection Zone (ZPE), which was accepted by the National Culture Council of SPAA. The classification was promulgated on 7 November 2012 as Announcement 13661/2012 (Diário da República, Série 2, 215 (7 Novembro 2012).|$|E
50|$|A {{small group}} called Náš Boj (Our Struggle), which {{operated}} under SS auspices, {{was the most}} radical element in the guard. Throughout its years of existence, the Hlinka Guard competed with the Hlinka party for primacy in ruling the country. After the anti-Nazi Slovak National Uprising in August 1944, the SS took over and shaped the Hlinka Guard to suit <b>its</b> <b>own</b> purposes. <b>Special</b> units of the guard (Pohotovostné oddiely Hlinkovej gardy - POHG) were employed against partisans and Jews.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in 1983, Citytv {{began to}} produce a New Year's Eve special live from Nathan Phillips Square in Downtown Toronto. Most {{recently}} known as the City New Year's Eve Bash, the yearly concert special expanded to include a second event in Calgary, Alberta for its 2012-13 edition. In 2013-14, City began simulcasting ABC's Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve instead of airing <b>its</b> <b>own</b> full <b>special,</b> though it continued to sponsor (and air some coverage of) the New Year's event in Toronto.|$|R
5000|$|The {{game was}} {{reviewed}} in 1994 in Dragon #211 by Jay & Dee in the [...] "Eye of the Monitor" [...] column. Jay did not rate the game, but Dee gave the game 3½ out of 5 stars.

500|$|Oliphant {{founded the}} Australian Academy of Science in 1954, {{teaming up with}} David Martyn to {{overcome}} the obstacles that had frustrated previous attempts. Oliphant was its president until 1956. Deciding that the Academy of Science should have <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> building, Oliphant raised the required money from donations. As chairman of the Building Design Committee, he selected and oversaw the construction of one of Canberra's most striking architectural designs. He also delivered the Academy of Science's 1961 Matthew Flinders Lecture, {{on the subject of}} [...] "Faraday in his time and today".|$|E
500|$|In 1867, Goya's biographer Charles Emile Yriarte {{considered}} the painting {{important enough to}} warrant <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> exhibition, {{but it was not}} until 1872 that The Third of May was listed in the Prado's published catalog, under the title Scene of the Third of May 1808. Both the Third and Second of May suffered damage in a road accident while being transported by truck to Valencia for safety during the Spanish Civil War, apparently the only time they have left Madrid. [...] Significant paint losses to the left side of the Second of May have been deliberately left unrepaired. [...] Restoration work to both paintings was done in 2008 in time for an exhibition marking the bicentennial of the uprising.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to physical assaults, Conan can use magic powers to damage enemies. Gaining these powers in later {{stages of the}} game, the barbarian can turn opponents into stone, call down fire from the heavens, and summon flocks of ravens to do his bidding. These magical attacks can quickly end fights, but their use {{is limited by the}} number of magic points Conan has. When an enemy is killed, colored runes—each one conferring <b>its</b> <b>own</b> <b>special</b> advantage—are released and gathered by the barbarian. Red runes act as experience points, which are exchanged for advanced attacks. Green and blue runes restore Conan's health and magic points, respectively. [...] The barbarian can also obtain runes by breaking containers and freeing maidens from captivity.|$|E
5000|$|WOSU {{also had}} <b>its</b> <b>own</b> {{televised}} auction <b>special,</b> [...] "Auction 34!", later renamed to [...] "GO Auction!" [...] around 2005.
