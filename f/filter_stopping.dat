So, the main purpose of controlling a gantry crane is transporting the load as fast as possible without causing any excessive sway at the final destination by using a two-dimensional gantry crane model and feed forward approach.

The method is experimentally verified using a flexible aluminum beam attached at the end-effector of a robot manipulator. The beam is rotated, using one joint of the manipulator, from an initial to a final position. During this motion, vibrations of the beam are excited due to inertial forces.
