500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Pillar brought a temporary glut of popular songs, including [...] "Nelson's Farewell", by The Dubliners, in which Nelson's airborne demise is presented as Ireland's contribution to the space race. During its more than 150 years, the Pillar was an integral if controversial part of Dublin life, and was often reflected in Irish literature of the period. James Joyce's novel Ulysses (1922) is a meticulous depiction of the city on a single day, 16 June 1904. At {{the base of the}} Pillar trams {{from all parts of the}} city come and go; meanwhile the character Stephen Dedalus fantasises a scene involving two elderly spinsters, who climb the steps [...] to the viewing gallery where they eat plums and spit the stones down on those below, while <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> [...] "the one-handled adulterer".|$|E

60|$|Daylight {{leaned back}} in his chair and <b>gazed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the {{kerosene}} lamps while he computed aloud.|$|R
6000|$|... "Where?" [...] {{she finally}} asked, {{removing}} the apron {{from her head}} and <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with a stricken face {{in which there was}} little curiosity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{he is out}} on {{the lake}} half his time, <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the 'Silent Pine,' or conversing with the 'Speaking Rocks,' or {{drinking}} at the 'Fairy Spring.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nothin'." [...] After a pause, {{in which}} he walked all round Uncle Ben's large figure, <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{him as if he}} were a monument, he added, [...] "Huntin' blackberrieth." ...|$|E
60|$|Mel {{raised her}} head and <b>gazed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him, wide-eyed, open-mouthed, as if both appalled and enthralled.|$|R

60|$|She {{continued}} to regard {{him with a}} cold look of loathing, this child that but two days ago had lain against his heart <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him in trust and adoration.|$|E
60|$|Numa, the lion, came {{steadily}} toward them; {{his attitude}} seemed more that of curiosity than of belligerency. Close {{to the side}} of the ship he stopped and stood <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> them.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Kitade, Tanabe and Fukunaga (respectively) <b>gaze</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the Summer Triangle with Inubōsaki {{lighthouse}} in {{the background}} in the music video.|$|R
60|$|Neale {{leaned back}} and <b>gazed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his subordinates. He felt a subtle change in them. They had arrived at some momentous decision.|$|R
60|$|The {{poor girl}} heard, but {{no sign of}} {{appreciation}} moved her pale face as she <b>gazed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the approaching chaos of waters.|$|R
60|$|Wyllard did not answer. He was <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the bridge, {{and once}} more the whistle gave a warning blast. It seemed that the two vessels could hardly pass clear of each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{handsome}} you look! What are {{you thinking}} about?" [...] she said, <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> him with her own eyes bright with wonder, and her cheeks glowing with the delicate carmine of the frosty air.|$|E
6000|$|Greta, {{with feet}} crossed, {{sat on a}} {{coloured}} blanket, dabbling her finger in a little pool of coffee, and <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Harz. And he thought: 'I should like to paint her like that. [...] "A forget-me-not."' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, Geraldine, I {{think you}} ought to tell,' he said as the loyal little thing <b>gazed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her new monarch. 'What did happen?' ...|$|R
60|$|There {{was a long}} silence. Mescal {{smoothed}} out Bolly's mane, and Hare <b>gazed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the walls with eyes that did not see them.|$|R
60|$|With {{his thumb}} {{he turned up}} one of my eyelids, whereat I opened my other eye and <b>gazed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the group bending over me.|$|R
60|$|So it befell that, one day, as Gopani-Kufa was <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> {{the river}} from a window of the palace he again saw the war-canoes of the white men; and at the sight his spirit misgave him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Lavender {{remained}} {{for a moment}} as if transfigured; then entering his garden, he stood <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> her window, until the thought that she might appear there was too much for him, and he went in.|$|E
60|$|And then Karenin stood up. He {{walked a}} few paces along the terrace and {{remained}} for a time <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> that great silver disc, that silvery shield that must needs be man's first conquest in outer space....|$|E

6000|$|Jim was on {{his knees}} with his hands clasped, <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the thing in a begging way, and working his lips, but not getting {{anything}} out. I took only just a glimpse, and was fading out again, but Tom says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Any {{one must}} have {{observed}} that, Rose," [...] answered the young man, <b>gazing</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the wall, {{in order not}} to be compelled to look the beautiful creature before him in the eyes--"Mrs. Budd has very strong tastes that way." ...|$|E
60|$|Mr. Travers {{stepped back}} a few paces and <b>gazed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the house. All was still. For a few moments he stood {{listening}} and then re-joined the boatswain.|$|R
