5|$|Chemolithotrophy {{is a type}} of {{metabolism}} {{found in}} prokaryotes where energy is obtained from the oxidation of inorganic compounds. These organisms can use hydrogen, reduced sulfur compounds (such as sulfide, hydrogen sulfide and thiosulfate), <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> (FeII) or ammonia as sources of reducing power and they gain energy from the oxidation of these compounds with electron acceptors such as oxygen or nitrite. These microbial processes are important in global biogeochemical cycles such as acetogenesis, nitrification and denitrification and are critical for soil fertility.|$|E
5|$|Lithotrophic {{bacteria}} can use inorganic compounds {{as a source}} of energy. Common inorganic electron donors are hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia (leading to nitrification), <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> and other reduced metal ions, and several reduced sulfur compounds. In unusual circumstances, the gas methane can be used by methanotrophic bacteria as both a source of electrons and a substrate for carbon anabolism. In both aerobic phototrophy and chemolithotrophy, oxygen is used as a terminal electron acceptor, whereas under anaerobic conditions inorganic compounds are used instead. Most lithotrophic organisms are autotrophic, whereas organotrophic organisms are heterotrophic.|$|E
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E

50|$|Umbellulone induces a rapid {{production}} of methemoglobine. Methemoglobine is a globin {{in the blood}} which mainly consists of ferric (Fe3+) haemoglobin {{instead of the usual}} ferrous (Fe2+) haemoglobin. Methemoglobin has a decreased ability to bind oxygen. But in combination with the 3 other <b>ferrous</b> <b>irons</b> on the hemoglobin unit, the oxygen release is also decreased. Red blood cells will be less able to nurture organs with oxygen. Therefore, the probability for a hypoxia increases. Methemoglobin lethality is possible at higher concentrations than 50% of the substance in red blood cells.|$|R

5|$|Celadon: Named after a pale-tinted spring green colour, Chinese {{archaeologist}} Wang Zhongshu (1982) {{asserts that}} shards having {{this type of}} ceramic glaze have been recovered from Eastern Han Dynasty (25–220 AD) tomb excavations in Zhejiang; he also asserts {{that this type of}} ceramic became well known during the Three Kingdoms (220–265). Richard Dewar (2002) disagrees with Wang's classification, stating that true celadon—which requires a minimum 1260°C (2300°F) furnace temperature, a preferred range of 1285° to 1305°C (2345° to 2381°F), and reduced firing—was not created until the beginning of the Northern Song Dynasty (960–1127). The unique grey or green celadon glaze is a result of iron oxide's transformation from ferric to <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> (Fe2O3 → FeO) during the firing process. Longquan celadon wares, which Nigel Wood (1999) writes were first made during the Northern Song, had bluish, blue-green, and olive green glazes and high silica and alkali contents which resembled later porcelain wares made at Jingdezhen and Dehua rather than stonewares.|$|E
5|$|Overdoses of {{ingested}} iron {{can cause}} excessive levels of free iron in the blood. High {{blood levels of}} free <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> react with peroxides to produce highly reactive free radicals that can damage DNA, proteins, lipids, and other cellular components. Iron toxicity occurs when the cell contains free iron, which generally occurs when iron levels exceed the availability of transferrin to bind the iron. Damage to {{the cells of the}} gastrointestinal tract can also prevent them from regulating iron absorption, leading to further increases in blood levels. Iron typically damages cells in the heart, liver and elsewhere, causing adverse effects that include coma, metabolic acidosis, shock, liver failure, coagulopathy, adult respiratory distress syndrome, long-term organ damage, and even death. Humans experience iron toxicity when the iron exceeds 20milligrams for every kilogram of body mass; 60milligrams per kilogram is considered a lethal dose. Overconsumption of iron, often the result of children eating large quantities of ferrous sulfate tablets intended for adult consumption, {{is one of the most}} common toxicological causes of death in children under six. The Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) sets the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for adults at 45mg/day. For children under fourteen years old the UL is 40mg/day.|$|E
25|$|Two {{important}} biological reaction {{mechanisms of}} nitric oxide are S-nitrosation of thiols, and nitrosylation of transition metal ions. S-nitrosation involves the (reversible) conversion of thiol groups, including cysteine residues in proteins, to form S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs). S-Nitrosation is {{a mechanism for}} dynamic, post-translational regulation of most or all major classes of protein. The second mechanism, nitrosylation, involves the binding of NO to a transition metal ion like iron or copper. In this function, NO {{is referred to as}} a nitrosyl ligand. Typical cases involve the nitrosylation of heme proteins like cytochromes, thereby disabling the normal enzymatic activity of the enzyme. Nitrosylated <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> is particularly stable, as the binding of the nitrosyl ligand to <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> (Fe(II)) is very strong. Hemoglobin is a prominent example of a heme protein that may be modified by NO by both pathways: NO may attach directly to the heme in the nitrosylation reaction, and independently form S-nitrosothiols by S-nitrosation of the thiol moieties.|$|E

25|$|Grossular is a calcium-aluminium garnet {{with the}} formula Ca3Al2(SiO4)3, though the calcium may in part be {{replaced}} by <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> and the aluminium by ferric iron. The name grossular {{is derived from the}} botanical name for the gooseberry, grossularia, in reference to the green garnet of this composition that is found in Siberia.

Because of its inferior hardness to zircon, which the yellow crystals resemble, they have also been called hessonite from the Greek meaning inferior. Grossular is found in contact metamorphosed limestones with vesuvianite, diopside, wollastonite and wernerite.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} analyze the {{magnetic}} behaviors of iron complexes biologically synthesized in magnetic bacteria MS- 1, we performed FMR (Ferromagnetic Resonance) measurements for each fraction of the cell. We observed FMR spectra from the ferric iron (Fe 3 þ) compounds distributed in each fraction of the MS- 1 cell. In particular, the magnetosome fraction yielded an anisotropic FMR signal, whereas other fractions were simple FMR spectra of a Gaussian type. Upon counting the numbers of spins in various cell fractions, we compared them with the iron population {{as determined by the}} 1. 10 -phenanthroline method. We found a good correlation between the number of spins and the iron population in several cell fractions.

3000|$|The central {{mechanism}} {{that caused the}} antibacterial activity by the particles might be through oxidative stress caused by ROS [37, 38]. ROS includes radicals like superoxide radicals (O_ 2 ^ - [...]), hydroxyl radicals (–OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2); and singlet oxygen (1 O 2) could be the reason damaging the proteins and DNA in the bacteria. ROS could have been produced by the present metal oxide (iron oxide) leading to the inhibition of most pathogenic bacteria like S. aureus, Xanthomonas, E. coli and P. vulgaris. A related study was explained by Kim et al. [16] in which hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was generated when Fe 2 + responded with oxygen. The <b>ferrous</b> <b>irons</b> reacted with the produced H 2 O 2 subsequently through Fenton reaction and thus leading to creating hydroxyl radicals which damage the biological macro-molecules [39].|$|R
25|$|In the cytoplasm, <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> {{is found}} in a soluble, chelatable state which {{constitutes}} the labile iron pool (~0.001 mM). In this pool, iron {{is thought to be}} bound to low-mass compounds such as peptides, carboxylates and phosphates, although some might be in a free, hydrated form (aqua ions). Alternatively, iron ions might be bound to specialized proteins known as metallochaperones. Specifically, poly-r(C)-binding proteins (PCBPs) appear to mediate transfer of free iron to ferritin (for storage) and non-heme iron enzymes (for use in catalysis). The labile iron pool is potentially toxic due to iron's ability to generate reactive oxygen species. Iron from this pool can be taken up by mitochondria via mitoferrin to synthesize Fe-S clusters and heme groups.|$|E
25|$|Iron export {{occurs in}} a variety of cell types, {{including}} neurons, erythrocytes, macrophages and enterocytes. The latter two are especially important since systemic iron levels depend upon them. There is only one known iron exporter, ferroportin. It transports <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> out of the cell, generally aided by ceruloplasmin and/or hephaestin (mostly in enterocytes), which oxidize iron to its ferric state so it can bind ferritin in the extracellular medium. Hepcidin causes the internalization of ferroportin, decreasing iron export. Besides, hepcidin seems to downregulate both TFR1 and DMT1 through an unknown mechanism. Another player assisting ferroportin in effecting cellular iron export is GAPDH. A specific post translationally modified isoform of GAPDH is recruited to the surface of iron loaded cells where it recruits apo-transferrin in close proximity to ferroportin so as to rapidly chelate the iron extruded.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of oxygen on Earth from its first production by cyanobacteria to the GOE and through today has drastically impacted {{the course of}} evolution of life and planet. It may have triggered the formation of oxidized minerals and the disappearance of oxidizable minerals like pyrite from ancient stream beds. The {{presence of}} banded-iron formations (BIFs) have been interpreted as a clue for the rise of oxygen since small amounts of oxygen could have reacted with reduced <b>ferrous</b> <b>iron</b> (Fe(II)) in the oceans, resulting in the deposition of sediments containing Fe(III) oxide in places like Western Australia. However, any oxidizing environment, including that provided by microbes such as the iron-oxidizing photoautotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris, can trigger iron oxide formation and thus BIF deposition. Other mechanisms include oxidation by UV light. Indeed, BIFs occur across large swaths of Earth’s history and may not correlate with only one event.|$|E
