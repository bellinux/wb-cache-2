50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century until the late 1990s, Lexington's economy was mainly based on textile and {{furniture}} manufacturing. Since then, most local manufacturers have moved their production facilities to Asia and Mexico {{as a way to}} reduce costs and remain competitive in a global market. This caused the closure of most textile and furniture factories and contributed to economic difficulties for a community that was heavily dependent on these two industries for employment.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that the {{consequences}} of terrorist attacks are beyond what is reported in the media. Equity investors can be adversely affected by these incidents. The authors&# 039; work justifies the war on terror. Design/methodology/approach - Using event study methodology, the authors test how abnormal returns have changed for <b>industrial</b> <b>portfolios</b> in Indonesia following the recent terrorist attacks in the USA, the UK, Spain, India and even Indonesia. The authors adjust the CAPM to test whether systematic risks are altered around these events. Findings - The findings show that equity portfolios were adversely affected by the September 11 attacks and Bali bombings. The domestic terrorist attack generated the worst outcomes. It appears that systematic risk has increased by the amount of terrorist risk. Other attacks in London, Madrid and Mumbai were minimal. Originality/value - This study shows how domestic and international terrorist events affect the risk and return in an Asian capital market...|$|R

40|$|Although {{diffusion}} is {{a complex}} process, it has not received the same attention as knowledge production. It is relatively unknown what guides the direction of technological knowledge diffusion, where sole empirical studies have only pointed to cognitive proximity as a compass. But in this case, diffusion patterns would be irrelevant of local context. By using an innovation system perspective, this thesis sees technological knowledge diffusion as a co-evolving user-producer interaction to {{argue that it is}} guided by both cognitive proximity and locality. This hypothesis is tested through the analysis of patent citations from organic chemistry, a field of deep industrial and scientific embedding. The results found give empirical evidence on how knowledge is heterogeneously diffused in different countries depending on the local presence of related scientific communities and industries. In consequence, technological relatedness is claimed to be locally built by user-producer interactions and more importantly, path dependency is suggested as a place dependent process. These discoveries encourage policy makers to support research in areas that are coherent with the local technological communities and <b>industrial</b> <b>portfolios</b> so as {{to take advantage of the}} benefits of new knowledge that has been locally produced...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{valuation}} {{model that}} allows for time variation in investment opportunities is developed and estimated. The model assumes that the investment opportunity set is completely described by two state variables, the real interest rate and the maximum Sharpe ratio, which follow correlated Ornstein- Uhlenbeck processes. The model parameters and time series of the state variables are estimated using data on US Treasury bond yields and expected in- flation for the period January 1952 to December 2000, and, as predicted, the estimated maximum Sharpe ratio is shown {{to be related to}} the equity premium. In cross-sectional asset pricing tests using the 25 Fama-French size and book-to-market portfolios, both state variables are found to have significant risk premia, which is consistent with the ICAPM of Merton (1973). In contrast to the CAPM and the Fama-French 3 -factor model, the simple ICAPM is not rejected by cross-sectional tests using the 25 Fama-French size and B/M sorted portfolios. Returns on the 30 <b>industrial</b> <b>portfolios</b> do not discriminate clearly between the three models. When both sets of portfolios are included as test assets all three models are rejected, but the estimated risk premia for both ICAPM state variables are significant while those associated with the Fama-French arbitrage portfolios are insignificant...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims to {{investigate}} the form of systematic risk of Australian industrial stock returns. We suggest using four stochastic state-space models for the analysis. The stochastic properties of systematic risk are studied by examining four classes of state-space models: random walk model, random coefficient model, ARMA(1, 1) model and mean reverting model (or moving mean model). We {{have found that the}} <b>industrial</b> <b>portfolio</b> betas are unstable. The variation of <b>industrial</b> <b>portfolio</b> beta is either random or mean-reverting. Among the nineteen industrial groups, ten of them have the mean-reverting process betas but six of them seem to have a moving long-term mean. Five of the industrial groups have the random process betas, more specifically; the betas of three of them are the random walk processes while the betas of the other two are just the random coefficients. We have also identified that the betas of five industrial groups seem to follow an ARMR(1, 1) processJuan Yao and Jiti Ga...|$|E

When {{a particular type of}} innovation in a particular industry suffers from a particular type of informational and coordination problems, various institutional environments will lead to a different industrial specialization. Using various measures of financial and labour market characteristics in 19 OECD countries, interaction terms are constructed to measure the impact of these characteristics- and their combinations- on industrial activity and <b>industrial</b> <b>portfolio</b> selection.

40|$|Diversification models {{based on}} the {{analysis}} of regional industrial portfolios were first developed in the 1970 s and applied {{to the problem of}} minimizing employment instability in U.

However, none of these authors has applied it to small regions such as a county located in a non-metropolitan area. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to assess the applicability of the <b>industrial</b> <b>portfolio</b> analysis approach in four non-metropolitan North Alabama counties. The authors contend that the lack of detailed time-series data seriously degrades the utility of this technique, not only in non-metropolitan regions but also in previously studied larger regions. When faced with these constraints, researchers in the past either have employed highly aggregated local data in their models or have substituted national data for missing local data.
