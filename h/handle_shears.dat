The proposed method returns the complete stress field and the unitary twist rotation of the cross section at once by performing only line integrals.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} the accuracy of hydrodynamical codes that use a moving Voronoi mesh is described. Our scheme {{is based on a}} new regularization scheme that constrains the mesh to be centroidal to high precision while still allowing the cells to move approximately with the local fluid velocity, thereby retaining the quasi-Lagrangian nature of the approach. Our regularization technique significantly reduces mesh noise that is attributed to changes in mesh topology and deviations from mesh regularity. We demonstrate the advantages of our method on various test problems, and note in particular improvements obtained in <b>handling</b> <b>shear</b> instabilities, mixing, and in angular momentum conservation. Calculations of adiabatic jets in which shear excites Kelvin Helmholtz instability show reduction of mesh noise and entropy generation. In contrast, simulations of the collapse and formation of an isolated disc galaxy are nearly unaffected, showing that numerical errors due to the choice of regularization do not impact the outcome in this case.

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} {{is to develop a}} {{constraint}} based viscoplastic fluid model suitable for time-efficient dynamics simulation in 3 D of granular matter.

This model is extended with additional constraints to <b>handle</b> <b>shear</b> forces, which is necessary to model granular material. Some test cases are specified and compared visually to each other and to the results of other work. The model seems to work visually but more analysis and larger systems are needed to be certain.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{extension}} of a novel numerical technique, labelled Line Element-less Method (LEM), {{in order to provide}} approximate solutions of the De Saint Venant torsion problem for orthotropic beams having simply and multiply-connected cross-section. A suitable transformation of coordinates allows {{to take full advantage of}} the theory of analytic complex functions as in the isotropic case. A complex potential function analytic in all the transformed domain whose real and imaginary parts are related to the shear stress components and to the orthotropic ratio is introduced and expanded in the double-ended Laurent series involving harmonic polynomials. An element-free weak form procedure has been proposed imposing that the square of the net flux of the shear stress across the border is minimized with respect to the series coefficients. Numerical implementation of the LEM results in system of linear algebraic equations involving symmetric and positive-definite matrices. All the integrals are transferred into the boundary without requiring any discretization neither in the domain nor in the contour. The technique provides the complete shear stress field as shown by some numerical applications in order to assess the efficiency and the accuracy of the method to <b>handle</b> <b>shear</b> stress problems in presence of orthotropic material...|$|R

40|$|Affine {{transformation}} (or geometric transformation) {{provides a}} mathematical foundation for shape manipulation and motion analysis in computer graphics. In particular, the set Aff^+(3) of positive (or, reflection free) affine transformations is important since {{it consists of}} rotation, shear, translation, and their compositions. The elements in Aff^+(3) are usually represented by 4 × 4 -homogeneous matrices with algebraic operations such as addition, scalar product, and product. While the product corresponds to {{the composition of the}} transformations, geometric meaning of addition and scalar product are not clear. There are many situations where we want to have geometrically meaningful weighted sum (linear combination) of transformations, for example, for skinning [10], and for motion analysis and compression [1]. To mention a few parameterization developed previously: Euler angle, and Quaternion parameterizes the rotation. Dual quaternion, and axis-angle presentation parameterizes the rigid transformation (rotation and translation altogether). The above parameterizations are all partial; they deal only subsets of Aff^+(3), and cannot <b>handle</b> <b>shear</b> and scale. On the other hand, Alexa [1] introduced a Euclidean parameterization of Aff^+(3) using the Lie correspondence. The idea is that Aff^+(3) forms a Lie group and it corresponds to a linear space called Lie algebra through the matrix exponential and logarithm. However, this method yet fails to give a parameterization for the whole transformations; it is limited for transformations without negative eigenvalues. The limitation is due to mathematical nature of the Lie correspondence, which guarantees only local bijectivity. Here we introduce a novel parameterization of Aff^+(3) based on Lie theory. Our general framework can also be found in [12], which includes more precise definitions of Lie group and Lie algebra. It has several advantages over previous ones; ? No limitation; it parameterizes the whole transformations. ? Smooth and having the same degree of freedom; ordinary variational techniques can be applied. ? With geometrically meaningful operations; for example, the sum of two rigid transformations is again rigid. ? Low computational cost; fast enough for real-time applications. In the following sections, we will give the new parameterization method, a computation algorithm, and applications to shape deformation...|$|R

The main {{advantage of this}} method over the ordinary finite strip method {{is that it can}} <b>handle</b> the <b>shear</b> effects due to the use of complex functions. In addition, distortional buckling as well as all other buckling modes of cold-formed steel sections like local and global modes can be investigated by the suggested complex finite strip method. A combination of general loading including bending, compression, shear and transverse compression forces is considered in the analytical model. For validation purposes, the results are compared with those obtained by the Generalized Beam Theory analysis. In order to illustrate the capabilities of complex finite strip method in modelling the buckling behavior of cold-formed steel structures, a number of case studies with different applications are presented.

40|$|A Lagrangian {{numerical}} method, {{known as}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), {{has been applied}} to simulate flash floods triggering and resulting propagation. As test case, the authors consider the northern slope of Monte Sant’Angelo di Cava mountain, where a fast pyroclastic slide left three casualties in the city of Nocera Inferiore (Southern Italy), on March 4 th, 2005. The physical domain is discretized with a collection of so called “particles” without connectivity law among them, avoiding problems related with grid refinements. While boundary particles are fixed over time, computing particles are free to move in response to external and internal forces such as gravity and pressure. More specifically, computing particles are all initially “frozen”. Once a particle is “unfrozen” it starts moving and it triggers a change in pressure in the neighbouring particles: when a pressure threshold plim is reached, other particles are set in motion and the movement evolves. Runout velocity is controlled by <b>handling</b> the <b>shear</b> stress TAUbed with the fixed bed.

40|$|A Lagrangian {{numerical}} method, {{known as}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), {{has been applied}} to simulate debris flows triggering and resulting propagation over a hillside located in the city of Nocera Inferiore (Southern Italy). Debris flows have been simulated since long time for hazard mitigation assessment or deposit evaluation; despite so, only recently they have been reproduced by means of Lagrangian approaches, like for example the FEM method. Such a numerical technique shows as main drawback the development of a distorted mesh. Heavy grid refinement algorithms are therefore necessary, where large deformations are present. SPH overcomes such difficulties since no mesh is laid over the physical domain. Spatial discretization is indeed carried out with a collection of so called “particles” without connectivity law am ong them. While boundary particles are fixed over time, computing particles are free to move in response to external and internal forces such as gravity and pressu re. In more detail, computing particles are all initially “frozen”. Once a particle is “unfrozen” it starts moving and it triggers a change in pressure in the neighbouring particles: when a pressure threshold plim is reached, other particles are set in motion and the movement evolves. Runout velocity is controlled by <b>handling</b> the <b>shear</b> stress taubed with the fixed bed.

40|$|Recently, debris-flow {{kinds of}} {{phenomena}} have been reproduced {{by means of}} Lagrangian methods, such as Distinct Element Method (DEM) or Lagrangian Finite Element Method (LFEM). Among the others, meshless, Lagrangian numerical method, known as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), is here applied to simulate debris-flow initiation and propagation over the slope of a mountain located {{in the city of}} Nocera Inferiore (Southern Italy). Debris-flows have been simulated since long time for hazard mitigation assessment or deposit evaluation via Eulerian-based methods. Since they may feature mesh distortion as the computational domain evolves, heavy grid refinement algorithms are sometimes necessary, especially for those problems characterized by large deformations. SPH overcomes such difficulties since no mesh is needed over the physical domain. Spatial discretization is indeed carried out with a collection of particles without connectivity bonds among them. While boundary particles are fixed over time, computing particles are free to move in response of external and internal forces such as gravity and pressure. More in detail, computing particles are all initially frozen. Once a particle located in the upper region of the slope is set free, the others close to it move if a pressure threshold plim is reached. Other particles are subsequently triggered where the mentioned condition occur, as a domino effect. Runout velocity is controlled by <b>handling</b> the <b>shear</b> stress τbed with the fixed bed. Results show how different are the conditions of motion, by varying the location of the triggering area, the pressure threshold plim and the shear stress τbed.

5000|$|Special Design FeaturesThe {{design program}} asked for 8 office floors with a column-free area around a compact center core below 48 {{apartment}} floors. Due {{to the narrow}} tower, {{it was necessary to}} provide three lines of [...] "couple" [...] shear walls to maintain acceptable stiffness. The shear walls, however, could not be permitted within the 8 commercial floors at the lower level of the tower where only the shaft could be accommodated. By modifying the [...] "coupled-shear wall" [...] design, it was possible to determine the effect of the [...] "outriggers," [...] resulting in a moment diagram for the shear wall, center core. These moments were readily <b>handled</b> by the <b>shear</b> wall system. The slabs were designed as a combination of oneway-banded design post-tensioned slabs. The architectural layout did not lend itself to a straight and disciplined column layout. This, however, was easily overcome by deflecting the banded-tendon runs in the traverse direction laterally to correspond to the column layout. The longitudinal tendons were generally uniformly spaced except where they had to be deflected laterally around slab openings and mechanical obstructions.|$|R
40|$|The peak shear {{strength}} of rock joints obtained from direct shear tests, and the peak {{shear strength}} of rockfill, as interpreted from large-scale triaxial tests, have common non-linear strength envelopes. An extremely low stress index test for rock joints, the tilt test, with an apparent normal stress {{as low as}} 0. 001 MPa when sliding occurs, can also be performed to characterise rockfill. However for rockfill or rock dumps, larger samples with relevant particle sizes are desirable. Some full-scale tests at a dam site in Italy, using a 2 x 2 x 5 m tilt-shear test, were able to sample the as-compacted-as-built rockfill, with no need for using parallel (model) grading curves with reduced-sized particles. Interfaces between the rockfill or rock dump and eventual rock foundations, can be <b>handled</b> with similar <b>shear</b> strength estimation methods. In each case, a low-stress index test result is extrapolated to full scale and to engineering stress level by related non-linear strength laws. It is possible to estimate each through inexpensive characterisation. The non-linear, stress-dependent friction angles suggest that large rock dumps with constant slope angle will have strongly reducing factors of safety {{from top to bottom}} and from outside to inside. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this work, a {{spectral}} {{model is}} derived to investigate numerically unstably stratified homogeneous turbulence (USHT) at large Reynolds numbers. The modeling relies {{on an earlier}} work for passive scalar dynamics [Briard et al., J. Fluid Mech. 799, 159 (2016) ] and can <b>handle</b> both <b>shear</b> and mean scalar gradients. The extension of this model {{to the case of}} active scalar dynamics is the main theoretical contribution of this paper. This spectral modeling is then applied at large Reynolds numbers to analyze the scaling of the kinetic energy, scalar variance, and scalar flux spectra and to study as well the temporal evolution of the mixing parameter, the Froude number, and some anisotropy indicators in USHT. A theoretical prediction for the exponential growth rate of the kinetic energy, associated with our model equations, is derived and assessed numerically. Throughout the validation part, results are compared with an analogous approach, restricted to axisymmetric turbulence, which is more accurate in term of anisotropy description, but also much more costly in terms of computational resources [Burlot et al., J. Fluid Mech. 765, 17 (2015) ]. It is notably shown that our model can qualitatively recover all the features of the USHT dynamics, with good quantitative agreement on some specific aspects. In addition, some remarks are proposed to point out the similarities and differences between the physics of USHT, shear flows, and passive scalar dynamics with a mean gradient, the two latter configurations having been addressed previously with the same closure. Moreover, it is shown that the anisotropic part of the pressure spectrum in USHT scales in k^{- 11 / 3 } in the inertial range, similarly to the one in shear flows. Finally, at large Schmidt numbers, a different spectral range is found for the scalar flux: It first scales in k^{- 3 } around the Kolmogorov scale and then further in k^{- 1 } in the viscous-convective range...|$|R
40|$|That {{transport}} can be stressful to {{pigs and}} sheep has been inferred from behavioural and physiological measurements. Duration of journey {{is more likely}} to cause stress in pigs than in sheep, but loading and the start of travel are stressful to both. Vibration, related to vehicle design, and the jolting, shocks, and sudden impacts caused by road conditions andmanner of driving, are probably of more importance than noise. ventilation and stocking density can modulate the effects of ambient temperature, which may influence meat quality in pigs. Deprivation of food and water does not appearto stress sheep unduly, but this can become a serious welfare concern in the case of pigs. however,most journeys undertaken by pigs in the European Union are relatively short. In sheep, transport may follow soon after other stressful experiences such as weaning, <b>shearing,</b> <b>handling,</b> or marketing; the interaction ofthese factors in causing cumulative stress has not been studied. In pigs, fighting after the mixing of previously unacquainted animals is well known to be a welfare issue that can compromise meat quality. Considering the public interest in livestock transport and the large amounts of money involved, surprisingly little research has been done in the area, and more is urgently needed for legislation and welfare codes to be soundly based on scientific knowledge...|$|R
40|$|Noise {{injury in}} {{agriculture}} {{is a significant}} yet often unrecognized problem. Many farmers, farm workers, and family members are exposed to noise levels above recommended levels and have greater hearing loss than their non-farming contemporaries. The {{aim of this study}} was to gather up-to-date information on farm noise levels and to enhance the quality of information available to assist farmers in reducing noise exposure and meeting Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) regulations regarding noise management. Farm visits were conducted on 48 agricultural establishments that produce a range of commodities. Noise levels were measured at the ears of operators and bystanders involved in typical activities on farms. The average and peak noise levels were measured for 56 types of machinery or sites of farming activity, totaling 298 separate items and activities. Common noise hazards identified included firearms, tractors without cabs, workshop tools, small motors (e. g., chainsaws, augers, pumps), manual <b>handling</b> of pigs, <b>shearing</b> sheds, older cabbed tractors, and heavy machinery such as harvesters, bulldozers, and cotton module presses. We found that use of firearms without hearing protection presents a pressing hearing health priority. However, farming activities involving machinery used for prolonged periods also present significant risks to farmers' hearing health. Noise management strategies on the farm are essential in order to prevent noise injury among farmers...|$|R
40|$|An uneven load {{distribution}} on roofs allows a shear force {{to occur in}} the ridge. This shear force should be able to move between the two roof beams that are the roof truss, which is accomplished through a ridge bond. The magnitude of this force is dependent on the difference between the loads on each half of the roof and the span of the roof truss. The loads that contribute to this uneven distribution are often variable, such as snow- and wind loads. This in combination with a large span of the roof truss allows for a large shear force that the ridge bond should carry. With the transition from the Swedish standard BKR to EC this uneven {{load distribution}} has increased even more due to the significant change in snow load shape coefficient. Wood structures are especially vulnerable to this shear force due to their low tensile strength perpendicular to the fiber. The ridge bond transfers the force in a way that tensile forces act in perpendicular to the fiber, which puts the beam in risk of splitting. To get a grip on the magnitude of this shear force a calculation has been done on a hall with a wooden structure. The loads on the hall have been calculated with BKR and EC to show the difference between these two standards. Furthermore a simple ridge bond has been designed for each load case to see how it fairs up against the shear force. How can a bond be designed to manage the high shear forces present in the ridge {{and at the same time}} avoid the beam to split?When the problem is identified and what is needed to minimize the risk of splitting a number of bonds has been produced in excess of the ones Svensk Hallteknik uses as of now. Of the bonds produced only two has been fully designed to verify their capacity to <b>handle</b> the <b>shear</b> force. The two bonds that is designed is then put against each other through a number of criterions to choose one bond that is favorable at high shear forces.

40|$|A {{significant}} challenge faced {{when using}} blanking/piercing to machine sheet metal is the <b>handling</b> of the <b>shearing</b> force required for high strength and thick stock. Increased shearing forces {{lead to the}} requirement of higher performance expected from the pressing machine and result in increased wear on the punch tool and die. Clearance, employed to increase precision and quality in blanking/piercing operations, affects the shearing force as well. One of the techniques used to reduce the force required is the employment of a punch shear angle. In this study, the effects of punch shear angle and clearance on the forces required for blanking/piercing were examined on a grade of steel broadly used in the manufacturing industry, DC 01. Experiments were carried out using five different punch shear angles, namely 0 °, 2 °, 4 °, 8 °, and 16 °. Six matrices with varying clearance rates (0. 4 %t, 0. 5 %t, 0. 6 %t, 0. 7 %t, 0. 8 %t, and 0. 9 %t) were used in this study, and these clearances were altered by modular matrices on the die. This study shows that shearing forces can be reduced by 80 % when 16 ° punch angle is used. The results of the experiments were transferred to a fuzzy logic model to obtain extrapolated results for intermediate values which had not been obtained from the experiments. The results obtained from the experiments and the output from the fuzzy logic model were compared and found to be highly similar. These results have showed that the model developed using fuzzy logic {{can be used to}} determine different shear angles and clearance values...|$|R

40|$|Concentrated {{suspensions}} of microscale and nanoscale zerovalent iron particles (MZVI and NZVI) {{have been}} studied in recent years for the remediation of contaminated aquifers. The suspensions are injected into the subsurface to generate a reactive zone, and consequently the prediction of the particles distribution during the injection is a key aspect {{in the design of}} a field-scale injection. Colloidal dispersions of MZVI and NZVI are not stable in pure water, and shear thinning, environmentally friendly fluids (guar gum and xanthan gum solutions) were found to be effective in improving colloidal stability, thus greatly improving <b>handling</b> and injectability. <b>Shear</b> thinning fluids exhibit high viscosity in static conditions, improving the colloidal stability, and lower viscosity at high flow rates enabling the injection at limited pressures. Shear thinning fluids exhibit high viscosity in static conditions, improving the colloidal stability, and lower viscosity at high flow rates enabling the injection at limited pressures. In this work, co-funded by European Union project AQUAREHAB (FP 7 - Grant Agreement Nr. 226565), laboratory and pilot field tests for MZVI injection in saturated porous media are reported. MZVI was dispersed in guar gum solutions, and the transport behaviour under several polymer concentrations and injection rates was assessed in column tests. Based on the experimental results, a modelling approach is proposed to simulate the transport in porous media of nanoscale iron slurries, implemented in E-MNM 1 D (www. polito. it/groundwater/software). Colloid transport mechanisms are controlled by particle-collector and particle-particle interactions, usually modelled by a non equilibrium kinetic model accounting for deposition and release processes. The key aspects included in the E-MNM 1 D are clogging phenomena (i. e. reduction of porosity and permeability due to particles deposition), and the rheological properties of the carrier fluid (in this project, guar gum solution). The influence of colloid transport on porosity, permeability, and fluid viscosity is explicitly lumped into the model and the shear-thinning nature of the iron slurries is described by a modified Darcy law generalized for non Newtonian fluids. Since during the injection in wells the velocity field is not constant over the distance, E-MNM 1 D was modified in order to account for variable colloidal transport coefficients on flow rate thus allowing the estimation of the radius of influence during a full scale intervention. The flow and transport of MZVI slurries is solved in a radial domain for the simulation of field-scale injection, incorporating the abovementioned relevant mechanisms. The governing equations and model implementation are presented and discussed, along with examples of injection simulation...|$|R
