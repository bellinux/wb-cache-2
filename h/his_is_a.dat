25|$|In 2000, Coupland resumed {{a visual}} arts {{practice}} dormant since 1989. <b>His</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> post-medium practice that employs {{a variety of}} materials. A common theme in his work is a curiosity with the corrupting and seductive dimensions of pop culture and 20th century pop art, especially that of Andy Warhol. Another recurring theme is military imagery, the result {{of growing up in}} a military family {{at the height of the}} Cold War. He is represented by the Clark & Faria Gallery in Toronto. In June 2010 he announced his first efforts as a clothing designer by collaborating with Roots Canada on a collection that is a representation of classic Canadian icons. The Roots X Douglas Coupland collection was announced in The Globe and Mail and featured clothing, art installations, sculpture, custom designed art and retail spaces.|$|E
500|$|Rather than {{writing a}} wholly {{original}} philosophy of education, Locke, it seems, deliberately attempted to popularise several strands of seventeenth-century educational reform {{at the same}} time as introducing his own ideas. English writers such as John Evelyn, John Aubrey, John Eachard, and John Milton had previously advocated [...] "similar reforms in curriculum and teaching methods," [...] but they had not succeeded in reaching a wide audience. Curiously, though, Locke proclaims throughout his text that <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary work; as Nathan Tarcov, who has written an entire volume on Some Thoughts, has pointed out, [...] "Locke frequently explicitly opposes his recommendations to the 'usual,' 'common,' 'ordinary,' or 'general' education." ...|$|E

[...] His work experiences opened his eyes to see the world in a broader, more open-minded way and provided material for the songs he was beginning to write. [...] Early in his career Paul promised himself that he would always write about the things he knew well. In her review of Ellis Paul Live for the Folk and Music Exchange, Roberta Schwartz said, [...] "His finely honed songs tell stories filled with images that sparkle like jewels. [...] <b>His</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> poet's heart, and a romantic's soul. [...] He is an optimist who believes in people and possibilities." ...|$|E
500|$|Spiegelman {{suffers from}} a lazy eye, and thus lacks depth perception. [...] He says his art style is [...] "really a result of [...] deficiencies". [...] <b>His</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> style of labored simplicity, with dense visual motifs which often go unnoticed upon first viewing. [...] He sees comics as [...] "very {{condensed}} thought structures", more akin to poetry than prose, which need careful, time-consuming planning that their seeming simplicity belies.Spiegelman's work prominently displays his concern with form, and pushing the boundaries of {{what is and is}} not comics. [...] Early in the underground comix era, Spiegelman proclaimed to Robert Crumb, [...] "Time is an illusion that can be shattered in comics! [...] Showing the same scene from different angles freezes it in time by turning the page into a diagram—an orthographic projection!" [...] His comics experiment with time, space, recursion, and representation. [...] He uses the word [...] "decode" [...] to express the action of reading comics and sees comics as functioning best when expressed as diagrams, icons, or symbols.|$|E

2500|$|Buikstra [...] {{considers}} {{her work}} to be aligned with Blakey's biocultural version of bioarchaeology because of her emphasis on models stemming from critical theory and political economy. [...] She acknowledges that scholars such as Larsen are productive, but points out that <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> different type of bioarchaeology that focuses on quality of life, lifestyle, behavior, biological relatedness, and population history. [...] It does not closely link skeletal remains to their archaeological context, and is best viewed as a [...] "skeletal biology of the past." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{his role}} as [...] "a slight, unmeritable man" [...] in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar and as a {{rambling}} drunk in Antony and Cleopatra, other Renaissance-era writers portrayed Lepidus in a more positive way. Caspar Brülow's Latin play Caius Julius Caesar depicts Lepidus as Caesar's loyal ally, warning him against conspiracies and later planning revenge on his killers. Georges de Scudéry's La Mort de César portrays him in a similar light, warning Caesar, and later working closely with Antony, who refers to him as [...] "sage et prudent Lépide". In Pierre Corneille's Mort de Pompée <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> non-speaking role, simply presented as one of Caesar's entourage of officers.|$|E
2500|$|... "Judaism emphatically rejects any {{concept of}} {{plurality}} {{with respect to}} God" [...] explicitly rejecting polytheism, dualism, and trinitarianism, which are [...] "incompatible with monotheism as Judaism understands it." [...] The unity of God is stated many times in Jewish tradition. It is the second of Maimonides's 13 principles of faith; Maimonides wrote that [...] "This God is One, not two or more than two, but One whose unity is different from all other unities that there are. He is not one as a genus, which contains many species, is one. Nor is He one as a body, containing parts and dimensions, is one. But <b>His</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> unity than {{which there is no}} other anywhere" [...] (Yad, Yesode Ha-Torah 1:7).|$|E

2500|$|Rampal's first {{release of}} 2005 was Satish Kaushik's Vaada, {{in which he}} played a lead role {{opposite}} Ameesha Patel and Zayed Khan. The film was a flop. Patcy N of Rediff praised Rampal, writing: [...] "Arjun Rampal {{has done a good}} job; <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> subdued performance, and the model-turned-actor looks great in most scenes." [...] Rampal's next release was Vikram Bhatt's multi-starrer action film Elaan. The film managed to do well and became an average-grosser at the box office. Rampal earned critical acclaim for his performance in Elaan. Subhash K. Jha of IANS praised Rampal and wrote: [...] "Arjun is pretty much on his own. Once again playing a man with responsibilities he brings a controlled conviction to both his scenes with his screen daughter and his engrossing death scene." [...] Merril Diniz of Rediff wrote: [...] "Arjun Rampal is almost believable as the rugged ex-cop. He has a deep baritone and svelte body language." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1904, {{champion}} British golfer Harold Hilton described Travis: [...] "In style, the American champion {{is essentially}} {{what may be}} termed a made golfer, for <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> style which by the wildest stretch of imagination could not be called ornate. Still, it boasts useful attributes; it is business-like and determined, and {{is one in which}} no energy is wasted. Like all golfers who really scored a success at the game, he keeps the right elbow well in to the right side, holding the hands very low, like Messrs. Hutchings, Fry and G. F. Smith—three of the best examples of golfers who have risen to eminence while lacking the advantage of playing the game in their youth. The swing of the club is not long—in fact, it might be termed a three-quarter swing—but it is sufficient to get a free action with the wrist, and although Mr. Travis does not obtain an abnormal carry, he nevertheless gets a long roll on the ball, and against the wind in particular he is beyond the average as a driver, especially as he appears to have mastered the art of the scientific hooking." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon his return, Reavis visited New York {{to renew}} his acquaintances with various {{political}} and business leaders. [...] Showing his recently acquired documents to these luminaries netted Reavis several useful endorsements. [...] James Broadhead, who in 1884 believed the claim would be denied, followed his examination [...] by proclaiming, [...] "The Peralta claim has been submitted to Mr. Conkling, Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Hurd who have pronounced it good. [...] I have {{associated with them}} in the case and my opinion coincides with theirs. [...] Mr. J. Addison Reavis is the gentleman who is pushing the claim and <b>his</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> man of remarkable energy and persistence." [...] Roscoe Conkling in turn stated [...] "I can say, however, that having been consulted ... and having made a somewhat careful examination of the ancient papers and other papers produces, of which there are many, and on the facts and history of the case, I find they all go to show Mrs. Reavis to be the person she believes herself to be, namely the lineal descendant of the original grantee." [...] In addition to the endorsement, Conkling introduced Reavis to Robert G. Ingersoll. [...] Ingersoll was so impressed by Peralta papers that he agreed to represent Reavis in his efforts to have the new claim confirmed.|$|E
