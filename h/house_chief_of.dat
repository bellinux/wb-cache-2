5|$|Although {{a few of}} Harding's cabinet appointees were scandal-tarred, Coolidge {{initially}} retained all of them, out of {{an ardent}} conviction that as successor to a deceased elected president he was obligated to retain Harding's counselors and policies until the next election.

5|$|Reagan {{was sworn}} in as {{president}} for the second time on January 20, 1985, in a private ceremony at the White House. At 73 years of age, he was the oldest person to ever have been sworn into a second term. Because January 20 fell on a Sunday, a public celebration was not held but took place in the Capitol rotunda the following day. January 21 was one of the coldest days on record in Washington, D.C.; due to poor weather, inaugural celebrations were held inside the Capitol. In the coming weeks he shook up his staff somewhat, moving White <b>House</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> Staff James Baker to Secretary of the Treasury and naming Treasury Secretary Donald Regan, a former Merrill Lynch officer, Chief of Staff.|$|E
5|$|That afternoon, Reagan {{consulted}} with White House counsel Fred Fielding by telephone, {{debating whether to}} invoke the amendment and, if so, whether such a transfer would set an undesirable precedent. Fielding and White <b>House</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> Staff Donald Regan recommended that Reagan transfer power and two letters doing so were drafted: the first letter specifically invoked Section 3 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment; the second only mentioned that Reagan was mindful of this provision. At 10:32a.m. on July 13, Reagan signed the second letter and ordered its delivery to the appropriate officers as required under the amendment. Vice President George H. W. Bush was Acting President from 11:28 a.m. until 7:22 p.m., when Reagan transmitted a second letter to resume the powers and duties of the office.|$|E

However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White <b>House</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as they saw him as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E
5|$|Born in Lincoln, Nebraska, Cheney was {{primarily}} raised in Sumner, Nebraska, and Casper, Wyoming. He attended Yale {{and then the}} University of Wyoming, at the latter of which he earned a BA and an MA in Political Science. He began his political career as an intern for Congressman William A. Steiger, eventually working {{his way into the}} White House during the Nixon and Ford administrations, where he later served as the White <b>House</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> Staff, from 1975 to 1977.

5|$|Clark {{set himself}} three initial goals in {{civilian}} life—to earn $40 {{million in the}} business world and practice philanthropy, to become an adjunct professor, and to become a professional golfer. Clark began a public speaking tour in the summer of 2000 and approached several former government officials for advice on work after life in government, including House Speaker Newt Gingrich, White <b>House</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>of</b> Staff Mack McLarty, and Richard Holbrooke. Clark took McLarty's advice to move back to Little Rock, Arkansas, and took a position with the Stephens Group, an investment firm headquartered there. He took several other board positions at defense-related firms, and in March 2003 he amicably left the Stephens Group to found Wesley K. Clark & Associates. Clark wrote two books, Waging Modern War and Winning Modern Wars. He also authored forewords for a series of military biographies and a series of editorials. He had amassed only about $3.1 million towards his $40 million goal by 2003, and he began considering running for public office instead of pursuing his business career.|$|E
