40|$|This paper {{integrates}} {{a number}} of recent themes in the literature on banking and asset markets–optimal risk sharing, limited market participation, asset-price volatility, market liquidity, and Þnancial crises–in a generalequilibrium theory of the Þnancial system. A complex Þnancial system comprises both Þnancial markets Þnancial institutions. Financial institutions can take the form of <b>intermediaries</b> <b>or</b> banks. Banks, unlike intermediaries, are subject to runs, but crises do not imply market failure. We show that a sophisticated Þnancial system–a system with complete markets for aggregate risk and limited market participation–is incentive-efficient, if the institutions take the form of <b>intermediaries,</b> <b>or</b> else constrained-efficient, if they take the form of banks. We also consider an economy in which the markets for aggregate risks are incomplete. In this context, there is a role for prudential regulation: regulating liquidity can improve welfare. 1 Markets, intermediaries and crises Financial crises in Southeast Asia, Russia, and elsewhere have revived interest in the theory of Þnancial crises. To understand the origins of Þnancia...|$|R
