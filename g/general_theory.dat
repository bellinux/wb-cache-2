Keynes expanded on the concept of liquidity preferences and built a <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> of how the economy worked. Keynes's theory was brought together both monetary and real economic factors for the first time, explained unemployment, and suggested policy achieving economic stability.|$|E

5|$|In {{everyday}} life, {{there are}} three familiar dimensions of space: height, width and depth. Einstein's <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> of relativity treats time as a dimension on par with the three spatial dimensions; in general relativity, space and time are not modeled as separate entities but are instead unified to a four-dimensional spacetime, three spatial dimensions and one time dimension.

Though none is completely adequate for the explanatory job, at least seven examples of <b>general</b> <b>theories</b> that help account for deviance make up the contemporary theoretical repertoire.

Shibata, well-known by the so-called Shibata-Okishio Theorem, was a pioneer of the so-called analytical Marxism and solved problems of Marxian economics by the <b>general</b> equilibrium <b>theory.</b> Finally, Aoyama made a pioneering attempt to dynamize the <b>general</b> equilibrium <b>theory.</b> On the basis of contributions made by these Kyoto economists, the remarkable development of the <b>general</b> equilibrium <b>theory</b> was made possible in Japan after 1945...|$|R

5|$|Current {{understanding}} of gravity {{is based on}} Albert Einstein's <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> of relativity. Formulated in 1915, general relativity explains gravity {{in terms of the}} geometry of space and time, or spacetime. It is formulated in the language of classical physics developed by physicists such as Isaac Newton and James Clerk Maxwell. The other nongravitational forces are explained in the framework of quantum mechanics. Developed {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century by a number of different physicists, quantum mechanics provides a radically different way of describing physical phenomena based on probability.|$|E
5|$|During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Keynes spearheaded a {{revolution}} in economic thinking, challenging the ideas of neoclassical economics that held that free markets would, in the short to medium term, automatically provide full employment, as long as workers were flexible in their wage demands. He instead argued that aggregate demand determined the overall level of economic activity and that inadequate aggregate demand could lead to prolonged periods of high unemployment. Keynes advocated the use of fiscal and monetary policies to mitigate the adverse effects of economic recessions and depressions. Keynes' magnum opus, The <b>General</b> <b>Theory</b> of Employment, Interest and Money, was published in 1936.|$|E

5|$|For {{a general}} system, states are {{typically}} not pure, but instead are represented as statistical mixtures of pure states, or mixed states, given by density matrices: self-adjoint operators of trace {{one on a}} Hilbert space. Moreover, for general quantum mechanical systems, {{the effects of a}} single measurement can influence other parts of a system {{in a manner that is}} described instead by a positive operator valued measure. Thus the structure both of the states and observables in the <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> is considerably more complicated than the idealization for pure states.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{there have}} been many ideas of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies). Theories of an impersonal Universe governed by {{physical}} laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Ancient Chinese philosophy encompassed the notion of the Universe including both all of space and all of time. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the Universe. The modern era of cosmology began with Albert Einstein's 1915 <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> of relativity, which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the Universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted Big Bang.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, Einstein {{applied the}} <b>general</b> <b>theory</b> of {{relativity}} {{to the structure}} of the universe as a whole. He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the cosmological constant, to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of Mach's principle in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or Einstein's static universe.|$|E
