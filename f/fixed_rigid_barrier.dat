40|$|Abstract Background There are {{increasing}} reports of deaths and serious complications {{associated with the}} use of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), of which right ventricular heart rupture is the most devastating. The use of a <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> has been suggested to offer protection against this lethal complication by preventing the heart from being drawn up against the sharp edges of the sternum. The aim of the present study was to determine whether a <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> can be safely inserted over the heart with regard to the sternum wound edge movement. Methods Sternotomy wounds were created in eight pigs. The wounds were treated with NPWT at - 40, - 70, - 120 and - 170 mmHg in the presence and absence of a <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> between the heart and the edges of the sternum. Wound contraction upon NPWT application, and wound distension under mechanical traction to draw apart the edges of the sternotomy were evaluated. Results Wound contraction resulting from NPWT was similar with and without the <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier.</b> When mechanical traction was applied to a NPWT treated sternum wound, the sternal edges were pulled apart. Wound distension upon traction was similar in the presence and absence of a the <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> during NPWT. Conclusions A <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> can safely be inserted between the heart and the edges of the sternum to protect the heart and lungs from rupture during NPWT. The sternum wound edge is stabilized equally well with as without the <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> during NPWT. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between designing for both <b>rigid</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>barrier</b> (RFB) and vehicle-to-vehicle tests is a topical area of research. Specifically, vehicle-to-vehicle compatibility {{has been a}} topic of keen interest to many researchers, and the interplay between the two aspects of design is presently addressed. In this paper, the studied vehicles for potential vehicle-to-vehicle impacts included: sport utility vehicles (SUVs), Pickups (PUs), and passenger cars. The SUV/PU-to-Car frontal impact tests were compared to those obtained from vehicle-to-rigid fixed barrier frontal impacts. Acceleration pulses at the B-pillar/rocker as well as dash and cabin intrusions were monitored and compared. Additionally, the energy distributions in SUV/PU-to-Car crash tests were compared to those of single vehicle-to-RFB tests. It was concluded from the analysis that vehicle weight and front-end stiffness were not always the overriding factors dictating performance. Design alternatives that have {{positive impact on the}} distribution of energy on both vehicles involved in a crash were shown to provide improvement in vehicle compatibility. In the present work, it was also shown that good geometrical interaction in SUV/PU-to-Car impact was fundamental in providing self and partner risk-reducing potential. Moreover, the effect of geometry was shown to possibly mask the effects of mass and stiffness. 1...|$|R

40|$|The figure {{depicts the}} aspects of a {{proposed}} deceleration-limiting design for crash walls {{at the sides of}} racetracks and highways. The proposal is intended to overcome the disadvantages of both <b>rigid</b> <b>barriers</b> and kinetic-energy-absorbing barriers of prior design. <b>Rigid</b> <b>barriers</b> can keep high-speed crashing motor vehicles from leaving roadways and thereby prevent injury to nearby persons and objects, but they can also subject the occupants of the vehicles to deceleration levels high enough to cause injury or death. Kinetic-energy-absorbing barriers of prior design reduce deceleration levels somewhat, but are not designed to soften impacts optimally; moreover, some of them allow debris to bounce back onto roadways or onto roadside areas, and, in cases of glancingly incident vehicles, some of them can trap the vehicles in such a manner as to cause more injury than would occur if the vehicles were allowed to skid along the <b>rigid</b> <b>barriers.</b> The proposed crash walls would (1) allow tangentially impacting vehicles to continue sliding along the racetrack without catching them, (2) catch directly impacting vehicles to prevent them from injuring nearby persons and objects, and (3) absorb kinetic energy in a more nearly optimum way to limit decelerations to levels that human occupants could survive...|$|R

40|$|Debris flow {{is widely}} {{recognized}} as one of the most dangerous landslide phenomena, and thus the design of structural mitigation measures constitutes an important issue. Numerical and experimental investigations on the dynamics of interaction between a flowing mass and a retaining structure are necessary to properly design these structures. Both close and open <b>rigid</b> <b>barriers</b> act as debris flow breakers. However, in the perspective of preventing the loss of effectiveness of a retaining system, open <b>rigid</b> <b>barriers</b> are more widely used, but the their retention mechanisms in not fully understood. The present research focuses on <b>rigid</b> <b>barriers</b> with multiple outlets, separated by piles. The influence of the pile and outlet widths on the flowing mass has been analyzed both in terms of trapping efficiency and kinetic energy reduction. This has been accomplished by using numerical simulations, based on a discrete element solver. The correct mechanism investigation, carried out from a numerical point of view, has first required the implementation of a sliding static friction and a rolling resistance model in the discrete element-based selected code. Results show interesting outcomings: the larger the outlet widths are, the more debris flow breaking and trapping mechanisms are enhanced. Furthemore, in order to guarantee the self-maintainace of the barrier during a multiple surge flow event, the outlet width should be chosen about six times the mean grain radius...|$|R

This description is used to model the shadowing due to a low-height semi-cylindrical noise barrier close to a tramway. After validation against the boundary element method, this solution is used in a gradient-based optimization approach of the admittance distribution to maximize the broadband insertion loss in a given receiver zone. First, a hypothetical but passive distribution is found, showing an improvement of more than 20 dB(A) with respect to a purely <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier.</b> Second, a feasible optimized surface treatment made of a porous layer and a micro-perforated resonant panel is proposed, with an improvement of 14 dB(A) with respect to an entirely <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> and 8 dB(A) with respect to a uniform absorbent barrier. The optimization provides an automatic way of tuning the resonant panel so that the attenuation is enhanced in the frequency band where the source has the most spectral content. The benefit of using a non-uniform admittance distribution is evaluated in this idealized context to be about 8 dB. ...|$|R

5000|$|Median {{barriers}} can {{be divided}} into three basic categories: <b>rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> systems, semi-rigid barrier systems, and flexible <b>barrier</b> systems. <b>Rigid</b> <b>barrier</b> systems are made up of concrete and are the most common barrier type in use today (e.g. Jersey barrier or concrete step barrier). They are the most costly to install, but have relatively low life-cycle costs, making them economically viable over time. The second barrier type, semi-rigid, is commonly known as guardrail or guiderail barriers. The initial installation of this type can reach as much as $100,000 per mile. [...] These more forgiving barriers are meant to absorb the impact of an accident, and as a result, increase the cost of their life-cycle with each crash and each repair. The third median barrier type is the flexible barrier systems (e.g. cable barriers). Cable barriers are the most forgiving and the least expensive to install, but have high life-cycle costs due to repair needs after crashes. On the other hand, they have been shown to have calculated cost benefits calculating to as much as $420,000 per mile annually.
