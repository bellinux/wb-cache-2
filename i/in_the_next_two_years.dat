5|$|For {{his second}} voyage Morrell {{took charge of}} a new ship, Tartar, which sailed from New York on July 19, 1824 for the Pacific Ocean. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> Tartar first {{explored}} the American coastline from the Straits of Magellan to Cape Blanco (now in Oregon). He then sailed westward to the islands of Hawaii, known at that time as the Sandwich Islands, where Captain James Cook had met his death nearly 40 years earlier. Thereafter Tartar returned to the American coast and tracked slowly southwards back to the Straits of Magellan.|$|E

He worked to expand the League, reducing the cost of membership to two annas (⅛ of a rupee), half of what it cost to join the Congress. He restructured the League {{along the lines of the}} Congress, putting most power in a Working Committee, which he appointed. By December 1939, Liaquat estimated that the League had three million two-anna members.|$|E

5|$|On 10 July 1651, {{the first}} {{significant}} naval battle {{of the war was}} fought south of Naxos, a three-day engagement in which the Venetians with 58 ships under Alvise Mocenigo were victorious over the twice as large Ottoman fleet. The remainders of the Ottoman fleet withdrew to Rhodes, from where they were however able to reach Candia. Mocenigo was replaced soon after by Leonardo Foscolo, but both sides did not accomplish much <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> although the Ottomans did succeed in supplying their forces on Crete while keeping their fleet intact.|$|E
5|$|On Valentine's Day 1997, the Commission {{announced}} it would support the Link with £32 million of funding, 42% of the project cost.

Another £46 million had to be raised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> before construction could commence, with contributions from BWB, seven local councils, Scottish Enterprise, and private donations being augmented by £8.6 million from the European Regional Development Fund.|$|E
5|$|After Parliament was {{dissolved}} in June 1802, another election saw Coke again returned, although in a contested election that cost the candidates £35,000. With {{the death of}} William Pitt in 1806, the two Whig groups agreed to an alliance, which {{took the form of}} the Ministry of All the Talents; Fox was confirmed as Foreign Secretary, and Windham as Secretary for War and the Colonies. The government apparently offered Coke a peerage, which he refused, and primarily focused on the abolition of slavery, which was accomplished only after the death of Fox on 13 September 1806. Fox's death made Parliament lose some of its appeal to Coke, as they had been close friends. His attendance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>years</b> was very limited, and the next occasion of note was his support of the Corn Laws, which were highly unpopular in Norfolk and led to him being physically attacked by a mob in 1815.|$|E

5|$|Although {{trained as}} a lawyer, Carmelo began fencing at an early age, {{beginning}} in the 1910s, {{at the behest of}} his father and, much like his father, specialized in épée, while also being proficient at fleuret. In 1918 he came in first place in the former category and second in the latter at a competition, organized by the city of Buenos Aires. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> he finished at the top in both events and became nationally known. In 1921 the Argentine Fencing Federation was founded and, in 1922, the organization sent him to represent Argentina in the Olimpiados Latinamericanos, a celebration overseen by the International Olympic Committee to celebrate the centenary of Brazil's declaration of independence. His native country won first place in the épée, fleuret and sabre events in the host city of Rio de Janeiro. At the age of 17, {{he was one of the}} youngest competitors to represent his country at these games.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the pool}} halls in 1870s Pittsburgh also {{broadcast}} horse races via telegraph. The often colorful race descriptions soon captured young Smith's attention and he wrote down and stockpiled the names and times of the winning horses for a year to form crude racing charts. In the fall of 1879, Smith placed his first bet on a 5:1 odds horse named Gabriel running in a race at the Brighton Beach racetrack at Coney Island. He won $38 when the horse won by 2 lengths but did not show any outward signs of emotion while the race was run. Determined that he could win at horse racing, Smith quit {{his job at the}} cork factory and accrued more than $5,000 from betting on horse races <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> hiding the proceeds under his mattress at home. Upon his mother eventually discovering the money, he reasoned with her that he was not really gambling because he was making logical predictions based on the past performances of horses and not merely guessing. By 1885, Smith had {{become one of the most}} touted gamblers in Pittsburgh and had won over $100,000 without ever seeing a horse race run firsthand. However, Smith was becoming too famous in Pittsburgh. He could not maintain the favorable, high odds when placing bets that he had attained earlier in his career when he was a virtual unknown because everyone in the crowd would lower the odds by betting his choices.|$|E
5|$|Though the Qing under Dorgon's {{leadership}} {{had successfully}} pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China, Ming loyalism was not dead yet. In early August 1652, Li Dingguo, {{who had served}} as general in Sichuan under bandit king Zhang Xianzhong (d. 1647) and was now protecting the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming, retook Guilin (Guangxi province) from the Qing. Within a month, most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side. Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in Huguang and Guangdong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>years,</b> Li failed to retake important cities. In 1653, the Qing court put Hong Chengchou in charge of retaking the southwest. Headquartered in Changsha (in what is now Hunan province), he patiently built up his forces; only in late 1658 did well-fed and well-supplied Qing troops mount a multipronged campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan. In late January 1659, a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan, sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby Burma, which was then ruled by King Pindale Min of the Toungoo dynasty. The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662, when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui, the former Ming general whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the Qing conquest of China.|$|E
