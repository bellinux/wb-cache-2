5|$|There are two {{distinct}} local weather phenomena, marked <b>downslope</b> lee winds {{caused by the}} proximity of the Pennines, leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach in excess of 60KT (70mph), most commonly in winter and spring. In the winter the presence of a subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense, persistent fog to form which can last for several days.|$|E
5|$|More violent eruptions are {{possible}} only in unique circumstances, {{such as an}} eruption into a lake. Any future eruption {{is most likely to}} affect only a limited area <b>downslope</b> from the volcano. Poisonous substances, such as volcanic gas, includes a variety of substances. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissoclated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. The volcanic gases that pose the greatest potential hazard to people, animals, agriculture, and property are sulfur dioxide, carbon dioxide and hydrogen fluoride. Locally, sulfur dioxide gas can lead to acid rain and air pollution downwind from the volcano.|$|E
5|$|Probably {{the most}} {{important}} ecological characteristic of abyssal ecosystems is energy limitation. Abyssal seafloor communities {{are considered to be}} food limited because benthic production depends on the input of detrital organic material produced in the euphotic zone, thousands of meters above. Most of the organic flux arrives as an attenuated rain of small particles (typically, only 0.5–2% of net primary production in the euphotic zone), which decreases inversely with water depth. The small particle flux can be augmented by the fall of larger carcasses and <b>downslope</b> transport of organic material near continental margins.|$|E

40|$|Reciprocal ST-segment <b>downsloping</b> on {{electrocardiogram}} is {{a frequent}} finding during ST-elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), but its etiology is still disputed. We sought to evaluate the relation between reciprocal ST-segment <b>downsloping</b> during STEMI and major cardiac perfusion and functional parameters. One hundred eighty-five patients with STEMI underwent emergency coronary angiography. The presence of reciprocal ST-segment <b>downsloping</b> was assessed. At coronary angiography, the corrected TIMI frame count (cTFC) was computed both on culprit and remote vessels and the occurrence of "no/slow reflow" phenomenon after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) identified. The left ventricular wall motion score index ratio (discharge/admission values) at echocardiography and the slope of high-sensitivity troponin elimination were computed as measures of effective myocardial reperfusion. Reciprocal ST-segment <b>downsloping</b> was revealed in 91 patients (49 %). They presented higher cTFC values on remote vessels than patients without reciprocal electrocardiographic abnormalities (44 ± 18 vs 37 ± 15 cineframes × second- 1, p = 0. 004). The presence of remote ST-segment <b>downsloping</b> was also associated with a higher prevalence of "no/slow reflow" phenomenon (59 % vs 40 %, p = 0. 013) {{as well as more}} abnormal values of wall motion score index ratio (p = 0. 042) and high-sensitivity troponin slope (p = 0. 012). At multivariate analyses, a higher cTFC on remote vessels predicted the occurrence of reciprocal ST-segment changes (p = 0. 018) and the development of "no/slow reflow" phenomenon after PCI (p = 0. 005). In conclusion, the presence of reciprocal ST-segment <b>downsloping</b> during STEMI clusters with significant perfusion and cardiac functional abnormalities, predicting the development of "no reflow" phenomenon after PCI...|$|R

5|$|Thomee (1986) mapped {{the habitat}} {{occupied}} by Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The snails occupied {{an area of}} 53.7m2 {{at the base of}} the Falls, with most snails found in an area of 11.4m2. More intense studies from 2002 to 2004 have further defined the occupied habitat. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found on a ledge beginning at 4m from the eastern edge of the Falls and extending to 16m from the Falls. In addition, Novisuccinea chittenangoensis can be found on the middle ledge 4m above the primary ledge and in the talus as far as 3m <b>downslope</b> from the primary ledge.|$|E
5|$|In Kohala, the {{numerous}} dikes near the summit inhibit groundwater from seeping <b>downslope</b> to the northeast, where it naturally wants to go. Rather, the Kohala dike complex guides it northwest or southeast, down {{the axis of}} the rift zones, just like the surface water. On the other hand, the three smaller valleys between the large ones - Honopue, Honokea, and Honokane Iki - {{as well as the}} many smaller gulches which are not yet valleys, are deprived of groundwater by the orientation of the rift zone and its dikes. Without the large amount of water that is received by the bigger valleys, these valleys grow far more slowly. Due to its topography as essentially a flat crater floor surrounded by cones and fault scarps, the main caldera is affected relatively little by erosion from water.|$|E
5|$|Mathilde is very dark, with an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the <b>downslope</b> direction.|$|E

5|$|The {{major cause}} of rain {{production}} is moisture moving along three-dimensional zones of temperature and moisture contrasts known as weather fronts. If enough moisture and upward motion is present, precipitation falls from convective clouds (those with strong upward vertical motion) such as cumulonimbus (thunder clouds) which can organize into narrow rainbands. In mountainous areas, heavy precipitation is possible where upslope flow is maximized within windward sides of the terrain at elevation which forces moist air to condense and fall out as rainfall {{along the sides of}} mountains. On the leeward side of mountains, desert climates can exist due to the dry air caused by <b>downslope</b> flow which causes heating and drying of the air mass. The movement of the monsoon trough, or intertropical convergence zone, brings rainy seasons to savannah climes.|$|E
25|$|Maryland has a {{wide array}} of climates, due to local variances in elevation, {{proximity}} to water, and protection from colder weather due to <b>downslope</b> winds.|$|E
25|$|Submarine {{landslides}} are turbidity {{currents and}} consist of water saturated sediments flowing <b>downslope.</b> An example {{occurred during the}} 1929 Grand Banks earthquake that struck the continental slope {{off the coast of}} Newfoundland. Minutes later, transatlantic telephone cables began breaking sequentially, farther and farther <b>downslope,</b> away from the epicenter. Twelve cables were snapped in a total of 28 places. Exact times and locations were recorded for each break. Investigators suggested that a 60-mile-per-hour (100km/h) submarine landslide or turbidity current of water saturated sediments swept 400 miles (600km) down the continental slope from the earthquake’s epicenter, snapping the cables as it passed.|$|E
40|$|In the World Ocean, densest waters {{found on}} the {{continental}} shelves induce density driven <b>downsloping</b> currents that can influence the deep ocean water masses properties. This process is poorly represented in z-coordinate ocean models, especially in Ocean General Circulation Model (OGCM) with coarse resolution in both horizontal and vertical directions. Consequently, continental shelves appear to be too isolated from the open ocean, whereas the density remains too low in the deep ocean. This study presents a simple parameterization of <b>downsloping</b> flow designed for z-coordinate, coarse resolution ocean model. At the shelf break, when the density on the shelf is higher than that in the neighbouring deep water column, a <b>downsloping</b> current is set up. This current is linearly related to the horizontal density gradient between the two adjacent boxes, using a prescribed coefficient. For simplicity, a uniform value of the coefficient is used here, although it should ideally vary in space. From the shelf, the <b>downsloping</b> flow is assumed to go downward along the slope until it reaches a level of equal density. An upward return flow of equal magnitude maintains the conservation of mass. This parameterization has been implemented in an OGCM and two experiments, with and without this scheme, have been integrated until equilibrium using restoring boundary conditions. The impact of the <b>downsloping</b> parameterization on the global ocean {{is dominated by the}} improvement of the Antarctic bottom water circulation and water mass properties. The parameterization increases the density of the deep ocean and tends to reduce the intensity and depth of the North Atlantic deep water circulation, which is in better agreement with observations. As a result of a higher exchange with the open ocean, the properties of continental shelf waters are also improved, with a marked reduction of the Antarctic shelves salinities. Therefore, this simple parameterization leads to a significant improvement of the model results, at little computational cost...|$|R

25|$|The {{climate of}} Kilimanjaro is {{influenced}} by the height of the mountain, which allows the simultaneous influence of the equatorial trade winds and the high altitude anti-trades, and the isolated position of the mountain.

25|$|The most {{important}} consideration in proper design and installation of retaining walls {{is to recognize}} and counteract the tendency of the retained material to move <b>downslope</b> due to gravity.

50|$|This {{illusion}} {{may make}} a pilot change (increase or decrease) the slope of their final approach. They are caused by runways with different widths, upsloping or <b>downsloping</b> runways, and upsloping or <b>downsloping</b> final approach terrain. Pilots learn to recognize a normal final approach by developing and recalling a mental image of the expected relationship between the length and the width of an average runway. An example would be a pilot used to small general aviation fields visiting a large international airport. The much wider runway would give the pilot the mental picture of {{the point where they}} would usually begin the flare, when they are much higher than they should be. A pilot flying an aircraft where the cockpit height relative to the ground is vastly higher or lower than they are used to can cause a similar illusion in {{the last part of the}} approach.|$|R
25|$|The reef face is {{the zone}} above the reef floor or the reef drop-off. This zone {{is often the}} most diverse area of the reef.

25|$|The loose, broken, and sharp, spiny {{surface of}} an aā flow makes hiking {{difficult}} and slow.

At the leading edge of an aā flow, however, these cooled fragments tumble down the steep front and are buried by the advancing flow. This produces a layer of lava fragments both at the bottom and top of an aā flow.|$|E
