5|$|The Sussex Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{developed}} in Sussex in southern England. It is a low, compact spaniel and {{is similar in}} appearance to the Clumber Spaniel. They can be slow-paced, but can have a clownish and energetic temperament. They suffer from health conditions common to spaniels and some large dogs, {{as well as a}} specific range of <b>heart</b> <b>conditions</b> and spinal disc herniation.|$|E

5|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>conditions</b> in the Sussex Spaniel {{can include}} {{pulmonary}} valve stenosis, {{which is the}} most common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with this condition, the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of this condition can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>conditions</b> {{related to}} the King Charles Spaniel include mitral valve disease, in which the mitral valve degrades, causing blood to flow {{backwards}} through the chambers {{of the heart and}} eventually leading to congestive heart failure. Patent ductus arteriosus, where blood is channelled back from the heart into the lungs, is also seen and can lead to heart failure. Both of these conditions present with similar symptoms and are inheritable. The OFA conducted a survey on cardiac disease, where of 105 breeds, the King Charles Spaniel was found to be 7th worst, with 2.1% of 189 dogs affected.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>conditions</b> such as dilated cardiomyopathy, {{where the}} heart becomes {{weakened}} and enlarged, and sick sinus syndrome, {{which is a}} type of abnormal heart beating which causes low blood pressure, have been identified in the breed. Phosphofructokinase deficiency is a condition caused by a recessive gene in the breed which prevents the metabolism of glucose into energy, causing the dog to have extremely low energy and be unable to exercise. The gene which causes this appears in around 10 percent of the population, but DNA testing can prevent two carrier dogs from breeding and thus creating puppies with this condition.|$|E

25|$|In August 2011, Publix began {{offering}} Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor {{that is used}} to prevent, treat, or improve symptoms of high blood pressure, certain <b>heart</b> <b>conditions,</b> diabetes, and certain chronic kidney conditions, as another free prescription. Customers can get a 90-day supply of this prescription for free at any Publix Pharmacy, up to a maximum of 180 tablets. Lisinopril-HCTZ combination products are excluded.|$|E
25|$|Estrogen {{replacement}} therapy {{such as the}} birth control pill, has been used since the condition was described in 1938 to promote development of secondary sexual characteristics.

25|$|Health risks can be {{produced}} by long-term use or excessive doses of AAS. These effects include harmful changes in cholesterol levels (increased low-density lipoprotein and decreased high-density lipoprotein), acne, high blood pressure, liver damage (mainly with most oral AAS), and dangerous changes {{in the structure of}} the left ventricle of the <b>heart.</b> <b>Conditions</b> pertaining to hormonal imbalances such as gynecomastia and testicular size reduction may also be caused by AAS.|$|E
25|$|A {{trend that}} is {{developing}} is {{the purchase of}} AEDs {{to be used in}} the home, particularly by those with known existing <b>heart</b> <b>conditions.</b> The number of devices in the community has grown as prices have fallen to affordable levels. There has been some concern among medical professionals that these home users do not necessarily have appropriate training, and many advocate the more widespread use of community responders, who can be appropriately trained and managed.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingestion}} of ayahuasca {{can also cause}} significant, but temporary, emotional and psychological distress. Excessive use can lead to serotonin syndrome, with symptoms such as tremors, diarrhea, autonomic instability, hyperthermia, sweating, muscle spasms and possible death. Long-term negative effects are not known. A few deaths due to participation in the consumption of ayahuasca have been reported. Some of the deaths {{may have been due}} to unscreened preexisting <b>heart</b> <b>conditions,</b> interaction with drugs, such as antidepressants, recreational drugs, caffeine, or nicotine, or any of the various additional plants that are frequently added to brews.|$|E

25|$|In the past, {{bacteremia}} {{caused by}} dental procedures (in most cases due to streptococci viridans, which reside in oral cavity), {{such as a}} cleaning or extraction of a tooth {{was thought to be}} more clinically significant than it actually was. However, it is important that a dentist or a dental hygienist be told of any heart problems before commencing treatment. Antibiotics are administered to patients with certain <b>heart</b> <b>conditions</b> as a precaution, although this practice has changed in the US, with new American Heart Association guidelines released in 2007, and in the UK as of March 2008 due to new NICE guidelines. Everyday tooth brushing and flossing will similarly cause bacteremia. Although there is little evidence to support antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment, the current American Heart Association guidelines are highly accepted by clinicians and patients.|$|E
25|$|Kittens {{require a}} high-calorie diet that {{contains}} more protein than the diet of adult cats. Young orphaned kittens require cat milk {{every two to}} four hours, and they need physical stimulation to defecate and urinate. Cat milk replacement is manufactured to feed to young kittens, because cow's milk does not provide all the necessary nutrients. Human-reared kittens {{tend to be very}} affectionate with humans as adults and sometimes more dependent on them than kittens reared by their mothers, but they can also show volatile mood swings and aggression. Depending on the age at which they were orphaned and how long they were without their mothers, these kittens may be severely underweight and can have health problems later in life, such as <b>heart</b> <b>conditions.</b> The compromised immune system of orphaned kittens (from lack of antibodies found naturally in the mother's milk) can make them especially susceptible to infections, making antibiotics a necessity.|$|E
500|$|Riders {{are then}} ushered into the {{pre-flight}} [...] "Funhouse" [...] room {{by a team}} member. Here, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a backstage area where Grampa and Maggie are told not to ride due to certain safety restrictions (Maggie doesn't meet the 40 inch height requirement, and Grampa has certain <b>heart</b> <b>conditions</b> that could be aggravated, which proves to be true as he suffers a heart attack, a stroke and a massive aneurysm while trying to deny that he has any <b>heart</b> <b>conditions).</b> Grampa suddenly falls asleep while Maggie crawls into a nuclear reactor room, causing her to grow larger. Meanwhile, Krusty leads the Simpsons into a ride room where he tells them to enjoy the ride, before Sideshow Bob appears, knocks Krusty out, and tells the Simpsons Family to enter the ride vehicle. Homer enters, followed {{by the rest of}} the family. Sideshow Bob then tells the Simpsons and the riders that they must watch a safety video from Itchy and Scratchy. The screen then displays a recap of the safety reminders (but showing Scratchy's attempts to follow the safety rules getting sabotaged by Itchy constantly), while riders are ushered into the main ride room.|$|E

500|$|On November 23, a large mass of {{stagnant}} {{air over}} the East Coast trapped pollutants in the city's air.

On November 25, regional leaders announced a [...] "first-stage alert". During the alert, leaders of local and state governments asked residents and industry to take voluntary steps to minimize emissions. Health officials advised people with respiratory or <b>heart</b> <b>conditions</b> to stay indoors. The city shut off garbage incinerators, requiring massive hauling of garbage to landfills. A cold front dispersed the smog on November 26 and the alert ended.|$|E
