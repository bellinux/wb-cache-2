5|$|Scully and Doggett {{join the}} {{investigation}} at McKesson’s home. Scully suggests {{a connection between}} the burned body of Ariel McKesson who disappeared in 1956 and her mother, the latest victim. Scully believes that the burned body should be exhumed to potentially learn the connection with the other deaths. Later, the gravediggers already have the coffin excavated when Detective Abbott shows up at the town cemetery. They tell him that they did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> because somebody already dug the coffin up and scratched the lid up. While they drive off with the body, Abbott inspects a dead tree. The creature is within and it eviscerates Abbott.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} species of fungus that grow alongside the domatia where the ants live. In fact, when the founding queen first starts laying eggs in the domatia of a new H. physophora, the hyphae of multiple different species of fungi will entirely cover {{the entrance to the}} domatia. When the worker ants mature, they actually <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> their way through the fungal covering to get to the outside of the plant. However, almost even more remarkably, out of all of these fungal species, A. decemarticulatus will only cultivate one specific species. This fungus is a sooty mold which, according to one study by Mario X. Ruiz-Gonzalez et al. (2010), is characterized by closely related haplotypes (genetic markers) in the order Chaetothyriales. The ants use this mold to construct their traps.|$|E

If we don’t this time, then what happens next? Appeasement only makes the aggressor more aggressive, and the players really understand that. We believe in our cause and our leadership and I believe we’re more unified this time and ready for a fight." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{power cut}} at Old Trafford delayed {{proceedings}} against West Ham on 10January, a match that ended 4–1 to Manchester United. The partnership of Yorke and Cole {{was starting to}} click, evident in the 6–2 win at Leicester City. Five goals were scored {{in the second half}} including a hat-trick for the former, cutting Chelsea's lead at the top to two points. On 31 January, Manchester United moved a point clear at the Premiership summit {{for the first time in}} the season. Yorke's late header in the 89th minute made the 1–0 victory at Charlton Athletic their third consecutive league win (fifth in the month). Ferguson praised the team's resolve, adding, [...] "It's a good result for us, because there are games where you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> in and find a result." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the writing}} for the season, Ward and series' head writer Kent Osborne noted that it was {{increasingly}} difficult to produce new episode concepts because the writers had [...] "already used a lot of cool ideas". Osborne called this slump the [...] "season four blues". Ward went on to clarify that, [...] "everything's still coming out super weird and interesting—but it just gets a little harder. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> deeper." [...] To combat these issues, the writer staff tried different story writing methods, such as a technique called exquisite corpse, in which one writer starts a story {{on a sheet of}} paper, and the paper is folded and another writer tries to finish it. Ward, however, noted that [...] "the ideas are usually terrible". They also decided to experiment with different types of storytelling and to introduce more new characters to the show.|$|E
500|$|Arsenal only {{managed a}} draw against West Bromwich Albion on 20 November 2004; Robert Earnshaw's goal with 11 minutes {{remaining}} of normal time cancelled out Pirès’s opener. Arsenal lost their final match of November, away to Liverpool at Anfield. Vieira finished off a one-touch move to equalise for Arsenal – who were {{behind in the}} first half – but Neil Mellor scored the winning goal of the game, shooting from long range. Football pundit Alan Hansen in his analysis on Match of the Day criticised the temperament of Arsenal’s players and questioned their desire: [...] "When you have success, sometimes it isn't there and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> in with great determination and hard work, and at the moment they are not doing that. When you look at their two big players, Henry and Vieira, [...] must do better in future." [...] Arsenal ended the month in second, five points behind leaders Chelsea.|$|E

25|$|The {{vigorous}} {{campaign of}} mine warfare waged by the French and Germans was continued by the British, exploiting {{the advantage of}} being on the dip slope and only <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> horizontally into the ridge to undermine German positions. The Germans, on the steeper scarp slope, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> down before they could dig horizontally, which added to the German disadvantage in manpower and mining equipment. An attack was planned by the Germans to capture the British positions from which mine galleries were being dug under the German defences. Success would gain more defensive depth and forestall mine attacks on the German positions before the British <b>had</b> been able <b>to</b> organise their defences on the ridge.|$|R

500|$|American {{musician}} Shawn Colvin guest {{starred in}} the episode as Rachel Jordan, a character that she would later return to voice in the episode [...] "I'm Goin' to Praiseland" [...] (2001) from season twelve. In that episode, she stays at the Flanders' house with Ned, and leaves briefly after he attempted to mold her {{in the image of}} his deceased wife. At the end of the episode, however, she returns and has a date with him. Colvin told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that being raised in Carbondale, Illinois meant she did not have to do much research for the guest appearance: [...] "It's just very isolated [...] There was church music and that was about it. [...] I didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> too deep for the role. I suppose the whole 'Simpsons' thing is kind of like a hick town." [...] Colvin has shown a segment of her guest role on The Simpsons during some of her concerts, including one at Cape Cod Melody Tent in 2007. She has also performed the song that she sings in [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] in concert. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that during her 2001 concert at Barrymore Theatre, the [...] "loudest audience response came after she sang a ditty that she performed as a character on The Simpsons." [...] The song, called [...] "He's the Man", later appeared on the 2007 soundtrack album [...]|$|E
500|$|The lyrics on {{the rock}} album {{tried to focus on}} [...] "general themes that {{everyone}} can get their hands on", while the acoustic had introspective lyrics that are [...] "vulnerable and revealing", with things Grohl [...] "wouldn't say out loud, wouldn't even admit to myself." [...] Grohl declared that [...] "when you're writing songs that have a sort of anthemic quality, you can't really go lighthearted and sing about bullshit. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> into a deeper place to find the words", and that [...] "I don't know what it is about, this album, that makes it sound more heartfelt or deeper or more emotional, but when I listen to it, it really is." [...] These include [...] "Friend of a Friend", a song which Grohl wrote in the 1990s about himself and his former Nirvana bandmate Kurt Cobain during the time they shared an apartment together in 1990, and [...] "Still", talking about a suicide Grohl saw when he was ten in Virginia, by a boy who jumped on the train tracks. Much of the album's theme and content, including the title, came after Grohl spent time on the campaign trail with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. [...] "We'd pull in to small towns, and thousands of people would come to be rescued by this man", said Grohl. [...] "It's not a political record, but what I saw inspired me." ...|$|E

25|$|We can {{conclude}} that these mound builders were organized.

2500|$|Lipstadt {{hired the}} British {{solicitor}} Anthony Julius to present her case. Penguin hired Davenport Lyons libel specialists Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman. Together they briefed the libel barrister, Richard Rampton QC. Penguin also instructed Heather Rogers as junior barrister. Penguin {{knew that they}} were going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> deep to defend against Irving's claims. Lipstadt's claims would need to be backed up by some heavyweight experts and Penguin would foot the bill. They retained Professor Richard J. Evans, historian and Professor of Modern History at Cambridge University, as their lead witness. As an expert witness, Evans was expected to prepare a report, and to be cross-examined. Also working as expert witnesses were the American Holocaust historian Christopher Browning, the German historian Peter Longerich, the Dutch architectural expert Robert Jan van Pelt, and the Political Science Professor [...] of the Free University of Berlin.|$|E
2500|$|Another Republican, Ron Ramsey, the Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee, {{questioned}} whether Islam is [...] "actually a religion, {{or is it}} a nationality, way of life, cult {{or whatever you want to}} call it" [...] and described it as resembling [...] "a violent political philosophy more than [...] peace-loving religion." [...] His comments, made in the run-up to a Republican primary election, were strongly criticised by a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations. He said that Ramsey's comments were part of [...] "a disturbing trend in our nation in which it is suggested that American Muslims should have fewer or more restricted constitutional rights than citizens of other faiths." [...] Murfreesboro's local state Senator, Bill Ketron, subsequently introduced what The American Prospect described as [...] "one of the most extreme anti-Sharia-law bills in the country", authorizing the state attorney general to designate [...] "Sharia organizations" [...] and imposing a 15-year jail term on anyone convicted of supporting such an organization. The law was passed, but the state legislature took out direct references to Sharia and Islam. Hedy Weinburg of the American Civil Liberties Union's Tennessee branch views the controversy as part of a trend; she told The American Prospect that [...] "ou don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>dig</b> too deep to see and hear the very rampant xenophobia and anti-Muslim voices." ...|$|E
