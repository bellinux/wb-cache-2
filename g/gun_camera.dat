5|$|Recent {{research}} by historian Norman Fortier suggests that Mayer {{was shot down}} by Lieutenant Walter Gresham of the 358th Fighter Squadron of the 355th Fighter Wing. The claim is based on <b>gun</b> <b>camera</b> footage and recollections of Mayer's wingman, who was forced to bail out during the action. Mayer was buried at the cemetery of Beaumont-le-Roger, France, and in 1955 re-interred at the German War Cemetery in St. Desiré de Lisieux.|$|E

Fitted with a radio compass and <b>gun</b> <b>camera.</b> Considerably heavier than the fighter at , but it retained the flying characteristics of the single-seat aircraft. 584 built, the last two delivered in 1947.|$|E
5|$|There were 32 IDWSs {{available}} to the Marine Corps in June 2012. The system had not been fired in combat as V-22s were routinely escorted by helicopter gunships and close air support aircraft, allowing them to focus on their transport role; squadrons also often flew without the belly gun, as the added weight reduced its cargo-carrying capacity. The Osprey's speed means that it can outrun supporting conventional helicopters, thus requiring a self-defense capability on long-range missions, and operate independently. The infrared <b>gun</b> <b>camera</b> has proven valuable for reconnaissance and surveillance. Other weapons are being studied to provide an all-quadrant defensive weapon system including nose guns, door guns, and nonlethal countermeasures {{to work with the}} current ramp-mounted machine gun and the IDWS.|$|E

50|$|In 1944 Fairchild {{changed the}} company name from Fairchild Aviation to Fairchild Camera and Instrument Company. Its product {{portfolio}} expanded during World War II from aerial photography equipment to include machine <b>gun</b> <b>cameras,</b> x-ray <b>cameras,</b> radar <b>cameras,</b> <b>gun</b> synchronizers, and radio compasses.|$|R
50|$|The use of <b>gun</b> <b>cameras</b> {{first became}} common for gunnery {{training}} in the 1920s though examples were used during World War I by the British Royal Flying Corps. A special version of the standard Lewis Machine Gun was manufactured as a <b>Camera</b> <b>Gun.</b> During World War II, as the Luftwaffe did with the German Robot II <b>camera,</b> <b>gun</b> <b>cameras</b> were commonly used on operational aircraft to record kills of enemy aircraft. Some of this footage survives to this day and is often the source for stock footage in World War II movies, TV shows or video games.|$|R
5|$|In early 1942, Rudel {{got married}} while home on leave. Later in the year, he {{took part in}} the Battle of Stalingrad. In February 1943, Rudel flew his 1,000th combat mission. He then participated in the {{experiments}} with using the Ju87G in the anti-tank role. The anti-tank unit took part in operations against the Soviet Kerch–Eltigen Operation. The footage from an onboard <b>gun</b> <b>camera</b> was used in Die Deutsche Wochenschau, a Reich Ministry of Propaganda newsreel. In April 1943, Rudel was awarded the Oak Leaves to the Knight's Cross, receiving them from Hitler personally in Berlin. Rudel participated in the Battle of Kursk with the same unit. In October 1943, Rudel was credited with the destruction of his 100th tank and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords on 25 November.|$|E
5|$|Finucane claimed {{three more}} successes in the spring, one Fw 190 on 26 March escorting 24 Douglas A-20 Havocs from 88 and 107 squadrons to attack Le Havre docks; another on 28 March and one Bf 109 and another Fw 190 on 17 May 1942. Four {{aircraft}} were claimed as shared, two probably destroyed and four damaged. Life magazine filmed the squadron's sortie on 26 March, as the fighters {{took off and}} landed. This operation was significant as Finucane's unit was also making use of <b>gun</b> <b>camera</b> footage to help verify combat claims. Finucane used footage to verify two claims on 2 April. Despite two clear images of two Fw 190s being hit he was credited only with one damaged. 602 was prompted to use the cameras because the Command thought the squadron's claims were excessive and the pilots were over stating their success. The Air Ministry also accelerated a plan to introduce the Spitfire IX to restore qualitative parity with the Fw 190 which was inflicting heavy losses on British fighter formations; primarily through German pilots taking full advantage of its superior performance over the Spitfire V. Finucane took at least one flight in the Spitfire IX. He flew the personal aircraft of commanding officer W. G. G. Duncan Smith, 64 Squadron, on 26 June 1942.|$|E

25|$|Fw 190 A-3/U4 — The A-3/U4 was a {{reconnaissance}} {{version with}} two RB 12.5 {{cameras in the}} rear fuselage and a EK 16 <b>gun</b> <b>camera</b> or a Robot II miniature camera in {{the leading edge of}} the port wing root. Armament was similar to the U3, however, and the ETC 501 was usually fitted with the standardized Luftwaffe 300 litre-capacity (80US gal) drop tank.|$|E
25|$|Fw 190 A-5/U2 — The A-5/U2 was {{designed}} as a night Jabo-Rei and featured anti-reflective fittings and exhaust flame dampers. A centre-line ETC 501 rack typically held a 250kg (550lb) bomb, and wing-mounted racks mounted 300L drop tanks. A EK16 <b>gun</b> <b>camera,</b> as well as landing lights, were fitted to the wing leading edge. The U2 was armed with only two 20mm MG 151 cannon.|$|E
25|$|The {{armament}} comprised {{a pair of}} 12.7mm Breda-SAFAT machine guns, housing 300 rounds each, {{installed in}} the upper fuselage; in addition, provisions were made for the fitting of bomblet-dispensers (spezzoniera). It was also possible to install a <b>gun</b> <b>camera,</b> while a small internal bay {{could be used to}} hold a few 4.4 lb (2 kg) incendiary bombs. This armament, while typical amongst Italian-built aircraft at the time, was relatively light in comparison to foreign-built rivals then being constructed; additional weapons, such as the installation of a pair of wing-mounted guns, was studied but never applied.|$|E
25|$|Many Allied fighter <b>gun</b> <b>cameras</b> often {{revealed}} that aircraft {{which had been}} claimed destroyed as '109's were often Arado Ar 96 trainers with a cadet pilot at the controls. To counter this non-combat flights were only {{to be carried out}} at dawn and dusk. The Luftwaffe expanded aircraft warning systems and devised radio signals to warn flights of intruders. If attacked, poorly armed aircraft were to dive down to tree-top level, and if necessary, the pilot was to belly land and take cover, as pilots were far more important than aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>camera</b> <b>gun</b> {{version was}} made for training. The body was of cast metal. The grip and trigger {{mechanism}} were realistic.

50|$|By the Fall of 1944, {{the medium}} bombers of the 41st {{were no longer}} needed in the Central Pacific, so the Seventh Air Force withdrew the Group to Wheeler Field, Hawaii in October 1944. For seven months the Group {{remained}} in Hawaii, flying antisubmarine patrols and training missions. The crews practiced bombing, using a newer model B-25, and acquainted themselves with the capabilities of rockets, which had replaced the 75mm cannon of the older B-25s. New gunnery techniques were also employed during practice on tow targets, and <b>gun</b> <b>cameras</b> were used during maneuvers with local fighters.|$|R
25|$|Electrical power {{came from}} a 24 volt DC {{generator}} on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine, which supplied AC power for radios. The radiator shutters, supercharger gear change, <b>gun</b> <b>camera,</b> bomb bay, bomb/rocket release {{and all the other}} crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery. The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P. devices. The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically {{in the event of a}} crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers.|$|E
25|$|Although Zhang was {{credited}} by the PLAAF for shooting down Davis' F-86, {{doubts about the}} claim were raised due to US Air Force's recollection of the event was inconsistent with Zhang's own account of the battle, and that Davis had claimed to have shot down two Chinese MiGs moments before being killed. The lack of <b>gun</b> <b>camera</b> footage from Chinese side meant Zhang's victory claim also hinged on his own recollection of the event. After declassifying their involvement in the Korean War 40 years later, Russian sources disputed Zhang's claim by raising the possibility that 1st Lieutenant Mikhail Akimovich Averin was the MiG pilot that had shot down Davis' plane. According to the recollections from the pilots of the Soviet 64th Aviation Corps, both Zhang and his wingman were probably shot down by Davis, who was in turn surprised and shot down by Mikhail A. Averin scrambling to save the Chinese MiGs. Lieutenant General Georgeii Lobov, commander of the 64th Aviation Corps, also noted in his memoir that Davis {{was killed by a}} Soviet pilot. Currently, both China and Russia have taken credit over Davis' death with no conclusive evidence to confirm either sides of the story.|$|E
25|$|On 29 January 1940 Flight Lieutenant Caesar Hull led {{a section}} of 43 Squadron to {{intercept}} an unidentified aircraft caught on radar. Ten miles south-west of Hartlepool at 90:45 GMT, they engaged a Heinkel He 111. It was one of nine He 111s that had separated form its formation upon reaching the English coast. Hull, Carey and Pilot Officer H. L North fired at it as they chased it out over the sea. They observed no results and returned to base. Hull found a bullet hole in his Hurricane upon landing. The He 111 was from 6. Staffel (Squadron), Kampfgeschwader 26 (4./KG 26). On 30 January Frank and Hull were on patrol near Coquet Island. They intercepted 26 He 111s from KG 26 that were targeting merchant shipping and fishing boats. The German bombers were flying at low altitude just below the cloud line at approximately 1,000ft. This tactic enabled the German bomber pilot to easily escape into the cloud if spotted. The two pilots dropped to sea-level and engaged an enemy unseen. The He 111, from, 4./KG 26, crashed into the sea. Pilot Feldwebel Helmut Höfner were posted missing in action. The observer was confirmed to {{have been killed in}} action when his body was recovered. Carey attempted to use his <b>gun</b> <b>camera</b> to record the Heinkel as it sank nose-first on the water but it failed to work.|$|E

50|$|Bomb damage {{assessment}} (BDA), {{also known as}} battle {{damage assessment}}, is the practice of assessing damage inflicted on a target from a stand-off weapon, most typically a bomb or air launched missile. It {{is part of the}} larger discipline of combat assessment. Assessment is performed using many techniques including footage from in-weapon <b>cameras,</b> <b>gun</b> <b>cameras,</b> forces on the ground near the target, satellite imagery and follow-up visits to the target. Preventing information on battle damage reaching the enemy is a key objective of military censorship. For nuclear weapons special techniques may be required due to the extensive damage caused and difficulty in approaching the site.|$|R
500|$|There is some dispute {{regarding}} who exactly {{shot down}} his fighter. Some sources {{claim that he}} was shot during the dogfight and while the aircraft was falling to the ground, he was shot at again a few feet above ground, possibly by the Mustangs of 354th FG. [...] Lt Wilbur Jarvis, No. 2 in the flight led by Doyle received a Damaged credit (not a kill) for Oesau's aircraft. Doyle noted bullet damage in the cockpit area and his <b>gun</b> <b>camera</b> footage showed that it was Oesau's Green 13.
