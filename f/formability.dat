5|$|Niobium is an {{effective}} microalloying element for steel, within which it forms niobium carbide and niobium nitride. These compounds improve the grain refining, and retard recrystallization and precipitation hardening. These effects in turn increase the toughness, strength, <b>formability,</b> and weldability. Within microalloyed stainless steels, the niobium content is a small (less than 0.1%) but important addition to {{high strength low alloy}} steels that are widely used structurally in modern automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Lead's high density, atomic number, and <b>formability</b> {{form the}} basis for use of lead as a barrier that absorbs sound, vibration, and radiation. Lead has no natural {{resonance}} frequencies; as a result, sheet-lead is used as a sound deadening layer in the walls, floors, and ceilings of sound studios. Organ pipes are often made from a lead alloy, mixed with various amounts of tin to control the tone of each pipe. Lead is an established shielding material from radiation in nuclear science and in X-ray rooms due to its denseness and high attenuation coefficient. Molten lead {{has been used as a}} coolant for lead-cooled fast reactors.|$|E
5|$|Glass welding is {{a common}} {{practice}} during glassblowing. It is used very often {{in the construction of}} lighting, neon signs, flashtubes, scientific equipment, and the manufacture of dishes and other glassware. It is also used during glass casting for joining the halves of glass molds, making items such as bottles and jars. Welding glass is accomplished by heating the glass through the glass transition, turning it into a thick, formable, liquid mass. Heating is usually done with a gas or oxy-gas torch, or a furnace, because the temperatures for melting glass are often quite high. This temperature may vary, {{depending on the type of}} glass. For example, lead glass becomes a weldable liquid at around , and can be welded with a simple propane torch. On the other hand, quartz glass (fused silica) must be heated to over , but quickly loses its viscosity and <b>formability</b> if overheated, so an oxyhydrogen torch must be used. Sometimes a tube may be attached to the glass, allowing it to be blown into various shapes, such as bulbs, bottles, or tubes. When two pieces of liquid glass are pressed together, they will usually weld very readily. Welding a handle onto a pitcher can usually be done with relative ease. However, when welding a tube to another tube, a combination of blowing and suction, and pressing and pulling is used to ensure a good seal, to shape the glass, and to keep the surface tension from closing the tube in on itself. Sometimes a filler rod may be used, but usually not.|$|E

500|$|The {{reactivity}} of niobium with oxygen requires {{it to be}} worked in a vacuum or inert atmosphere, which significantly increases the cost and difficulty of production. [...] Vacuum arc remelting (VAR) and electron beam melting (EBM), novel processes at the time, enabled the development of niobium and other reactive metals. [...] The project that yielded C-103 began in 1959 {{with as many as}} 256 experimental niobium alloys in the [...] "C-series" [...] (possibly from columbium) that could be melted as buttons and rolled into sheet. [...] Wah Chang had an inventory of hafnium, refined from nuclear-grade zirconium alloys, that it wanted to put to commercial use. [...] The 103rd experimental composition of the C-series alloys, Nb-10Hf-1Ti, had the best combination of <b>formability</b> and high-temperature properties. Wah Chang fabricated the first 500-lb heat of C-103 in 1961, ingot to sheet, using EBM and VAR. The intended applications included turbine engines and liquid metal heat exchangers. [...] Competing niobium alloys from that era included FS85 (Nb-10W-28Ta-1Zr) from Fansteel Metallurgical Corp., Cb129Y (Nb-10W-10Hf-0.2Y) from Wah Chang and Boeing, Cb752 (Nb-10W-2.5Zr) from Union Carbide, and Nb1Zr from Superior Tube Co.|$|E

60|$|But {{as little}} can we {{conceive}} the oneness, except as the mid-point producing itself on each side; that is, manifesting itself on two opposite poles. Thus, from identity we derive duality, and from both together we obtain polarity, synthesis, indifference, predominance. The line is Time + Space, under {{the predominance of}} Time: Surface is Space + Time, under the predominance of Space, while Line + Surface as the synthesis of units, is the circle in the first dignity; to the sphere in the second; and to the globe in the third. In short, neither can the antagonists appear but as two forces of one power, nor can the power be conceived by us but as the equatorial point of the two counteracting forces; of which the hypomochlion of the lever is as good an illustration as anything can be that is thought of mechanically only, and exclusively of life. To make it adequate, we must substitute the idea of positive production for that of rest, or mere neutralization. To the fancy alone it is the null-point, or zero, but to the reason it is the punctum saliens, and the power itself in its eminence. Even in these, the most abstract and universal forms of all thought and perception—even in the ideas of time and space, we slip under them, as it were, a substratum; for we cannot think of them {{but as far as}} they are co-inherent, and therefore as reciprocally the measures of each other. Nor, again, can we finish the process without having the idea of motion as its immediate product. Thus we say, that time has one dimension, and imagine it to ourselves as a line. But the line we have already proved to be the productive synthesis of time, with space under the predominance of time. If we exclude space by an abstract assumption, the time remains as a spaceless point, and represents the concentered power of unity and active negation, i.e. retraction, determination, and limit, ab intra. But if we assume the time as excluded, the line vanishes, and we leave space dimensionless, an indistinguishable ALL, and therefore the representative of absolute weakness and formlessness, but, for that very reason, of infinite capacity and <b>formability.</b>|$|E

50|$|Copper, silicon, nickel, chromium, and {{phosphorus}} {{are added to}} increase corrosion resistance. Zirconium, calcium, and rare earth elements are added for sulfide-inclusion shape control which increases <b>formability.</b> These are needed because most HSLA steels have directionally sensitive properties. <b>Formability</b> and impact strength can vary significantly when tested longitudinally and transversely to the grain. Bends that are parallel to the longitudinal grain {{are more likely to}} crack around the outer edge because it experiences tensile loads. This directional characteristic is substantially reduced in HSLA steels that have been treated for sulfide shape control.|$|E
5000|$|The semi-axes of the ellipse {{formed in}} this circle {{allow for the}} {{measurement}} of relative strain in two primary directions, known as the major and minor directions, which correspond to the major and minor semi-axes of the ellipse.

Through repeated measurements, {{the shape of the}} curve can be obtained experimentally. Alternately, a <b>formability</b> limit diagram can be generated by mapping the shape of a failure criterion into the <b>formability</b> limit domain.|$|E

50|$|<b>Formability</b> is {{the ability}} of a given metal {{workpiece}} to undergo plastic deformation without being damaged. The plastic deformation capacity of metallic materials, however, is limited to a certain extent, at which point, the material could experience tearing or fracture (breakage).|$|E
50|$|The Lankford {{coefficient}} (also called Lankford value, R-value, {{or plastic}} strain ratio) {{is a measure}} of the plastic anisotropy of a rolled sheet metal. This scalar quantity is used extensively as an indicator of the <b>formability</b> of recrystallized low-carbon steel sheets.|$|E
5000|$|A forming limit diagram, {{also known}} as a forming limit curve, is used in sheet metal forming for {{predicting}} forming behaviour of sheet metal. The diagram attempts to provide a graphical description of material failure tests, such as a punched dome test. [...] In order to determine whether a given region has failed, a mechanical test is performed. The mechanical test is performed by placing a circular mark on the workpiece prior to deformation, and then measuring the post-deformation ellipse that is generated from the action on this circle. By repeating the mechanical test to generate a range of stress states, the <b>formability</b> limit diagram can be generated as a line at which failure is onset (see also <b>formability).</b>|$|E
