5|$|The game follows Hawk, an amnesic Valhalla gladiator who trains at {{his mentor}} Okamoto's gym. Among other {{recurring}} characters are Hiroko, a rebellious temple knight; Beth, {{a woman from}} the center who vows to always stay by Hawk's side; Daleth, who {{claims to be the}} Messiah, and fights Hawk multiple times; Zayin, a temple knight; and Gimmel, a man from the Arcadia forest, who knows Hawk <b>from</b> <b>somewhere.</b>|$|E
5|$|Compared to his two fellow protagonists, C.T. Smith was {{considered}} more novel. Anime News Network {{said he was}} one of the few fresh points of the series and had the most distinctive design among the cast, though even his role as an unassuming businessman who is actually an expert gunman felt as if it must be borrowed <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> else. MangaCast's reviewer, on the other hand, found his role mostly extraneous, due to being overshadowed by Gamma. Animemaniacs Magazine Online noted that Smith's physical appearance was later echoed by Bleachs central antagonist, Sōsuke Aizen.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} century BC, Theophrastus {{mentioned}} komakon, including it with cinnamon and cassia as an ingredient in aromatic confections. Guillaume Budé and Claudius Salmasius have identified komakon with cubeb, {{probably due to the}} resemblance which the word bears to the Javanese name of cubeb, kumukus. This is seen as a curious evidence of Greek trade with Java in a time earlier than that of Theophrastus. It is unlikely Greeks acquired them <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> else, since Javanese growers protected their monopoly of the trade by sterilizing the berries by scalding, ensuring that the vines were unable to be cultivated elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|The Klondike {{could be}} reached only by the Yukon River, either {{upstream}} from its delta, downstream from its head, or <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> in the middle through its tributaries. River boats could navigate the Yukon in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could be hot, while from October to June, during the long winters, temperatures could drop below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E
5|$|Under {{terrestrial}} conditions, {{conversion of}} one element to another is very rare. Therefore, {{the amount of}} carbon on Earth is effectively constant. Thus, processes that use carbon must obtain it <b>from</b> <b>somewhere</b> and dispose of it somewhere else. The paths of carbon in the environment form the carbon cycle. For example, photosynthetic plants draw carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (or seawater) and build it into biomass, as in the Calvin cycle, a process of carbon fixation. Some of this biomass is eaten by animals, while some carbon is exhaled by animals as carbon dioxide. The carbon cycle is considerably more complicated than this short loop; for example, some carbon dioxide is dissolved in the oceans; if bacteria do not consume it, dead plant or animal matter may become petroleum or coal, which releases carbon when burned.|$|E

25|$|In contrast, {{in civil}} law jurisdictions, courts give the {{writings}} of law professors significant weight, partly because civil law decisions traditionally were very brief, sometimes {{no more than a}} paragraph stating who wins and who loses.

He observes, however, that since Linear A was a common Aegean script such an assumption will not resolve the problem of multiplicity.|$|E
