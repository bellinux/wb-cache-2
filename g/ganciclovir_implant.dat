50|$|Often {{individuals}} with CMV retinitis will need surgery for either retinal detachment or intravitreal instillation of ganciclovir. Retinal detachment occurs {{in up to}} 29% of affected eyes, repair being most effective with endolaser and silicone oil endotamponade.Intravitreal <b>ganciclovir</b> <b>implant</b> has the benefit of less systemic toxicity. An adverse effect of this is retinal detachment (and vitreous hemorrhage), also there is no systemic beneficial effect for cytomegalovirus organ disease.|$|E

There are no procedural risks involved. More importantly, the potential adverse effects of systemic ganciclovir and the <b>ganciclovir</b> <b>implant</b> limit their use on a long-term basis. There is no reported need for monitoring of full blood count and serum creatinine levels as compared to intravenous ganciclovir use.|$|E

30|$|The role of topical {{therapy is}} {{pertinent}} as {{the disease is}} limited to the anterior segment without any posterior segment involvement. Chee and Jap reported that the use of topical ganciclovir in CMV anterior uveitis patients resulted in moderate response rates and lower recurrence rates as compared with systemic and <b>implant</b> <b>ganciclovir</b> [9]. Chronic prophylaxis was needed as hypertensive uveitis recurred after cessation of ganciclovir [8]. However, the duration of long-term therapy and its implications have not been reported in literature.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Purpose: To {{describe}} viral retinitis following intravitreal and periocular corticosteroid administration. Methods: Retrospective {{case series}} and comprehensive literature review. Results: We analyzed 5 unreported and 25 previously published cases of viral retinitis following local corticosteroid administration. Causes of retinitis included 23 CMV (76. 7 %), 5 HSV (16. 7 %), and 1 each VZV and unspecified (3. 3 %). Two of 22 tested patients (9. 1 %) were HIV positive. Twenty-one of 30 (70. 0 %) cases followed {{one or more}} intravitreal injections of triamcinolone acetonide (TA), 4 (13. 3 %) after one or more posterior sub-Tenon injections of TA, 3 (10. 0 %) after placement of a 0. 59 -mg fluocinolone acetonide implant (Retisert), and 1 (3. 3 %) each after an anterior subconjunctival injection of TA (together with IVTA), an anterior chamber injection, and an anterior sub-Tenon injection. Mean time from most recent corticosteroid administration to development of retinitis was 4. 2 months (median 3. 8; range 0. 25 - 13. 0). Twelve patients (40. 0 %) had type II diabetes mellitus. Treatments used included systemic antiviral agents (26 / 30, 86. 7 %), intravitreal antiviral injections (20 / 30, 66. 7 %), and <b>ganciclovir</b> intravitreal <b>implants</b> (4 / 30, 13. 3 %). Conclusions: Viral retinitis may develop or reactivate following intraocular or periocular corticosteroid administration. Average time to development of retinitis was 4 months, and CMV was the most frequently observed agent. Diabetes was a frequent co-morbidity and several patients with uveitis who developed retinitis were also receiving systemic immunosuppressive therapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this prospective study was to evaluate the efficacy and complications {{of the use of}} an intraocular sustained-release <b>ganciclovir</b> <b>implant</b> for the treatment of active cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients. Thirty-nine eyes of 26 patients were submitted to ocular surgery. All patients underwent complete ocular examination before and after surgery. The surgical procedure was always done under local anesthesia using the same technique. The mean time for the surgical procedure was 20 min (range, 15 to 30 min). The average follow-up period was 3. 7 months. Of all patient, only 4 presented recurrence of retinitis after 8, 8, 9 and 2 months, respectively. Three of them received a successful second implant. All 39 eyes of the 26 patients presented healing of retinitis as shown by clinical improvement evaluated by indirect binocular ophthalmoscopy and retinography. Retinitis healed within a period of 4 to 6 weeks in all patients, with clinical regression signs from the third week on. Six (15. 4 %) eyes developed retinal detachment. None of the patients developed CMV retinitis in the contralateral eye. The intraocular implant proved to be effective in controlling the progression of retinitis for a period of up to 8 months even in patients for whom systemic therapy with either ganciclovir or foscarnet or both had failed. The intraocular sustained-release <b>ganciclovir</b> <b>implant</b> proved to be a safe new procedure for the treatment of CMV retinitis, avoiding the systemic side effects caused by the intravenous medications and improving {{the quality of life of}} the patients.

40|$|Purpose: To {{describe}} {{the treatment of}} cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis with intravitreal sustain-release ganciclovir devices in a 16 -year-old patient in third remission of acute lymphoblastic leukemia after stem cell transplantation. METHODS: The patient received a stem cell transplant from an unrelated bone marrow donor after which he contracted a serious CMV infection manifested in the lungs and retinae. His immune system at this time was almost completely depleted. Implantation of a sustained-release ganciclovir device was performed in both eyes when retinitis progressed in spite of aggressive antiviral intravenous treatment. RESULTS: No per- or postoperative complications were noted. Infiltrates, hemorrhages and macular edema present preoperatively dissolved {{over a period of}} six months. The final visual acuity was 1. 0 in both eyes. The patients immune system and lung function slowly recovered during the same time period. CONCLUSIONS: The intravitreal <b>ganciclovir</b> <b>implant</b> provides safe and effective therapy against CMV retinitis, and should be considered in patients acquiring the infection after stem cell transplantation...|$|E
40|$|To {{report and}} {{evaluate}} intravitreal ganciclovir injections in non-AIDS patients with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) retinitis. Retrospective chart review. Two SLE patients and one patient post chemotherapy for a non Hodgkin's lymphoma presented with myelosuppression and persistent cytomegalovirus retinitis despite systemic ganciclovir therapy. Patients {{were treated with}} 100 microL of intravitreal ganciclovir (4 mg/dL), initially given weekly. Systemic anti-CMV medication was stopped, and following quiescence, intravitreal injections were tapered and ultimately stopped based on therapeutic response. Patients were followed periodically for signs of recurrence. Intravitreal ganciclovir was well tolerated and led to remission of the retinitis in 2 patients. One patient had persistent smouldering disease and reached quiescence using an intravitreal <b>ganciclovir</b> <b>implant.</b> Fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis in one patient showed the presence of low CD 4 and CD 8 while treated with systemic ganciclovir, which improved with intravitreal treatment. In another, the low ratio was maintained against cytomegalovirus-specific antigens. Intravitreal ganciclovir injections {{should be considered as}} a treatment option in selected iatrogenically immunocompromised patients with HCMV retinitis.

40|$|Selective {{introduction}} of genes conferring chemosensitivity into proliferating tumor cells {{may be used}} to treat cancer. We investigated the bystander effect of retrovirusmediated gene transfer of herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene to murine neuroblastoma cell line (neuro- 2 a) in vitro and in vivo, and we examined whether the mechanism of bystander effect in neuroblastoma would also depend on connexin-dependent gap junction and/or immune response. A strong bystander effect was observed in vitro, whereby nontransduced tumor cells in proximity to transduced cells acquired susceptibility to <b>ganciclovir</b> (GCV) killing. <b>Implanted</b> mixtures of wildtype cells and HSV-TK transduced cells showed a potent bystander effect upon administration of GCV in A/J mice. HSV-TK/GCV system in murine neuroblastoma induced systemic immunity. Immunohistochemical staining showed many CD 4 + and CD 8 + cell infiltration but did not show anti-connexin 43 + cells. In conclusion, a strong bystander effect was observed in vitro and in vivo. The bystander effect in murine neuroblastoma might be dependent on immune response and/or on other mechanism such as protein phosphorylation or transfer of apoptotic vesicle, rather than connexin-dependent gap junction...|$|R
40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV) {{resistance}} to ganciclovir occurs via mutations in the UL 97 gene. CMV DNA, from vitreous and blood specimens and from culture isolates from 87 patients with ac-quired immunodeficiency syndrome and CMV retinitis {{who received a}} <b>ganciclovir</b> <b>implant,</b> was sequenced to identify {{the relationship between the}} UL 97 DNA sequences in the eye and periph-eral blood. There was 93. 5 % agreement between the UL 97 gene sequences from paired vitreous speci-mens and blood specimens. Sequence analysis of vitreous specimens showed that 15 % (13 / 87) of the patients had either a ganciclovir resistanceâconferring mutation or a polymorphism in the CMV UL 97 gene. Eleven of the 13 mutations or polymorphisms in the vitreous also were identified in blood. Although the number of mutations limits definitive interpretation, these data suggest that blood specimens may reflect the events occurring in the eyes of patients with CMV retinitis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) disease is among the most common opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS, and retinitis is the most frequent intraocular infection in patients with AIDS [1]. Un-treated, CMV retinitis spreads throughout the entire retina, result-ing in total retinal destruction and blindness [1]. As of Octobe...|$|E
