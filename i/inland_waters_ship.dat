50|$|A {{waterway}} is any navigable body of water. Broad distinctions {{are useful}} to avoid ambiguity, and disambiguation {{will be of}} varying importance depending on the nuance of the equivalent word in other languages. A first distinction is necessary between maritime shipping routes and waterways used by <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> craft. Maritime <b>shipping</b> routes cross oceans and seas, and some lakes, where navigability is assumed, and no engineering is required, except to provide the draft for deep-sea shipping to approach seaports (channels), or to provide a short cut across an isthmus; this is the function of ship canals. Dredged channels in the sea are not usually described as waterways. There is an exception to this initial distinction, essentially for legal purposes, see under international waters.|$|R

This paper elaborates on the {{development}} of elastic combined packing and an integrated device for treating domestic sewage aboard ships, analyzes the growth of combined packing microorganisms, the speed of membrane forming as well as the impact of raw water quality on membrane forming, and conducts a simulation experiment of treating domestic sewage by membrane bio-reactors. Researches show that elastic combined packing features high specific surface area and high speed of membrane forming and that this integrated domestic sewage treatment device performs well and can be widely applied. Preface As is known to all, ships {{play an important role in}} both <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> and maritime <b>shipping,</b> especially international cargo shipping. With the rapid development of shipping industry, people are concerned with those ships which are often referred to as a floating pollution source. Domestic sewage aboard ships contains plenty of aerobic organisms, which may exhaust the oxygen in seawater, resulting in oxygen deficit. When seawater lacks oxygen, anaerobic reaction will happen to those organisms and then organic acids and reducible gases, including H 2, CH 4, H 2 S and NH 3, will be generated, which may result in the smelliness of water body, the worsening of water qualit...|$|R
