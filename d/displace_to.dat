Dna2 can cleave the RPA bound flap as it is able to <b>displace</b> <b>to</b> RPA, while creating a flap to which RPA cannot bind. Then, FEN1 will complete the cleavage of the flap. Dna2 is a key part of this process. Without the Dna2, the RPA bound flaps could not be processed which would ultimately lead to cell instability. The Pif1 helicase is also involved in this pathway as it aids creation of long flaps. Without the Pif1 helicase, the flaps would not become long enough to need cleavage by Dna2.|$|E

30|$|Additionally, {{there is}} another {{difference}} between Nafion and Nafion–Titania composites that allowed discerning sigma–alpha relationships. The α-relaxation of the NT composite <b>displaces</b> <b>to</b> higher frequencies in the entire humidity range at T =  130 °C (Fig. 4 a). However, the α-relaxation of Nafion <b>displaces</b> <b>to</b> higher frequencies up to RH ~  60  %, above which the relaxation <b>displaces</b> <b>to</b> lower frequencies. In accordance with the analysis proposed in this study, at T =  130 °C, the motion of Nafion chains is not restricted by the α-relaxation, while {{the motion of the}} NT composite chains is. This result is in good agreement with the upturn of water uptake capacity at T >  110 °C for Nafion and at T >  130 °C fot the NT.|$|R
50|$|If a {{compartment}} or tank {{is either}} empty or full, {{there is no}} change in the craft's center of mass as it rolls from side to side (in strong winds, heavy seas, or on sharp motions or turns). However, if the compartment is only partially full, the liquid in the compartment will respond to the vessel's heave, pitch, roll, surge, sway or yaw. For example, as a vessel rolls to port, liquid will <b>displace</b> <b>to</b> the port side of a compartment, and this will move the vessel's center of mass to port. This has the effect of slowing the vessel's return to vertical.|$|E

50|$|These {{fish are}} burrowers, and they feed largely like garden eels, {{sticking}} their bodies {{out of their}} burrows to catch zooplankton. Unlike garden eels, they are not fixed in their burrows, but can move about both inside their burrows and in the open. Their burrows have funnel-shaped openings, due to the large quantities of sediments they <b>displace</b> <b>to</b> construct their burrows, and they consist largely of single elliptical vertical shafts with a chamber at the bottom. The burrows reach depths of up to 1 m, and 49 cm {{is considered to be}} typical. Bandfish excavate and maintain their burrows at dawn or dusk, with their mouth, and by pushing mud about with their body. They displace about three litres (three quarters of a gallon) of mud and sand in the excavation of a single burrow, and they take around six hours to construct their burrows. Their burrows often connect with those of the crab Goneplax rhomboides and other burrowing fish and crustaceans, and these associations may be deliberate.|$|E
5000|$|Weisburd's {{research}} has also repeatedly demonstrated {{the importance of these}} findings for crime prevention policy, particularly in the area of policing. [...] With the focus on explaining crime through place-based factors, police and other crime prevention agencies have stable targets on which to focus their efforts. Beginning with a ground-breaking experimental study with Lawrence Sherman in 1995, [...] Weisburd's {{research has}} repeatedly shown the efficacy of focusing police crime prevention resources on small hot spots of crime. [...] Specifically, this body of research shows that crime and disorder is significantly reduced in targeted hot spots and that crime does not simply <b>displace</b> <b>to</b> nearby areas. [...] In fact, Weisburd's research suggests that {{it is more likely that}} crime in nearby areas which received no extra police attention will also likely be reduced—a phenomenon that has been termed diffusion of crime control benefits. Weisburd's recent work has examined the impact of different types of police tactics in crime hot spots on people frequenting these targeted areas. One recent study examined the impact of police crackdowns on disorder on residents, while another focused on the New York Police department's usage of stop and frisks of suspicious persons.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{pathways}} {{that have}} been proposed to process Okazaki fragments.In the first pathway, only the nuclease FEN1 is involved. FEN1 cleaves the short [...] "flaps" [...] (or short sections of single stranded DNA that [...] "hang off" [...] because their nucleotide bases are prevented from binding to their complementary base pair—despite any base pairing downstream) immediately when they form. While this pathway can process basically all flaps, an issue with this pathway is that some flaps may escape cleavage and thus become long. These flaps then bind to replication protein A (RPA) which inhibits FEN1 cleavage.The second pathway thus becomes involved {{and is able to}} utilize both FEN1 and Dna2 nucleases to process the long flaps. Dna2 can cleave the RPA bound flap as it is able to <b>displace</b> <b>to</b> RPA, while creating a flap to which RPA cannot bind. Then, FEN1 will complete the cleavage of the flap. Dna2 is a key part of this process. Without the Dna2, the RPA bound flaps could not be processed which would ultimately lead to cell instability. The Pif1 helicase is also involved in this pathway as it aids creation of long flaps. Without the Pif1 helicase, the flaps would not become long enough to need cleavage by Dna2.Recently, {{it has been suggested that}} an alternative pathway for Okazaki fragment processing exists. This alternative pathway occurs when the Pif1 helicase removes entire Okazaki fragments initiated by fold back flaps.|$|E

30|$|Problem-oriented {{policing}} (POP) is a policing approach initially {{proposed in}} the 1970 s that focuses on “problem-solving” as a systematic way to understand crime and disorder [1]. Typically, POP follows the SARA model, where law enforcement (S)cans their jurisdiction for a problem, (A)nalyzes the issue, develops and deploys a (R)esponse, and then (A)ssesses {{the effectiveness of the}} response [2]. Knowledge-based approaches to identifying problems, such as CompStat (short for Computer Statistics) which analyzes crime data at an aggregate level, put emphasis on doing something quickly when crime spikes [3]. Responses are commonly implemented with a geographic focus; in practice, this is known as place-based or “hot spot” policing. Law enforcement dedicates resources to the problem area to combat the crime issue. One major concern of using this technique is that crime will merely <b>displace</b> <b>to</b> nearby areas, with the benefit to the response area coming at the expense of surrounding areas, creating a ‘whack-a-mole’ effect.|$|E

In a number of studies, problem-oriented policing {{has been found to}} be effective in reducing crime and disorder. However, very little is known about the value of problem-oriented interventions in controlling violent street crime. The National Academy of Sciences 2 ̆ 7 Panel on the Understanding and Control of Violent Behavior suggests that sustained research on problem-oriented policing initiatives that modify places, routine activities, and situations that promote violence could contribute much to the understanding and control of violence. This study evaluates the effects of problem-oriented policing interventions on urban violent crime problems in Jersey City, New Jersey. Twenty-four high-activity, violent crime places were matched into 12 pairs and one member of each pair was allocated to treatment conditions in a randomized block field experiment. The results of the impact evaluation support the growing body of research that asserts focused police efforts can reduce crime and disorder at problem places without causing crime problems to <b>displace</b> <b>to</b> surrounding areas...|$|E
