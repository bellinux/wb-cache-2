5|$|Zardari {{called for}} no delays to the 8 January {{parliamentary}} elections {{and for the}} participation of all opposition parties. Other major political parties quickly agreed to participate, ending any chance of a boycott. Because of the turmoil after the Bhutto assassination, the elections were postponed six weeks to 18 February. In January 2008, he suggested that if his party did win a majority, it might form a coalition with Musharraf's Pakistan Muslim League-Q (PML-Q). He and Nawaz Sharif, leader of the Pakistan Muslim League (N) party (PML-N), threatened national protests if any vote-rigging was attempted. He <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> not run for Parliament because he had not filed election papers in November 2008, back when he had no foreseeable political ambition while Bhutto was alive.|$|E
25|$|Islam {{reduced the}} effect of blood feuds, which was common among Arabs, by {{encouraging}} compensation in money rather than blood. In case the aggrieved party insisted on blood, unlike the pre-Islamic Arab tradition in which any male relative could be slain, only the culprit <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> be executed.|$|E

25|$|Soon {{after landing}} at the village, {{two of the}} Pillagers who were {{involved}} in Bugonaygeshig's escape were recognized and arrested. Bugonaygeshig <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> not be found, apparently having fled prior to their arrival. The soldiers made camp and began searching the surrounding woods and neighboring villages to arrest any Pillagers with outstanding warrants. None of those with arrest warrants were found and, in fact, there were few male Pillagers found to be present in the area.|$|E
25|$|The Montgomery {{cocktail}} is {{a martini}} mixed at {{a ratio of}} 15 parts gin to 1 part vermouth, and popular with Ernest Hemingway at Harry's Bar in Venice. The drink was facetiously named for Montgomery's supposed refusal to go into battle unless his numerical advantage was at least fifteen to one, and it appeared in Hemingway's 1950 novel Across the River and into the Trees. Ironically, following severe internal injuries received in the First World War, Montgomery <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> neither smoke nor drink.|$|E
25|$|Even {{after months}} of discussions, it was not {{possible}} to fashion a compromise between the two views, but a majority of the League's governing board supported Roelofs's views. Mee could not accept the decision and resigned from the League. From time to time Roelofs supplied Bulteno with tables of the Stelo's current value but never disclosed his principles or calculation method. Mee <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> not work out the underlying value ratios used, although he assumed that they had been archived.|$|E

25|$|Upon his arrest, Andersen {{initially}} denied having {{anything to}} do with the murders, even when confronted with DNA evidence. Moments later, when lead interrogator Geir Hansen suggested that Andersen <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> be a victim in the case, Andersen delivered a full confession, naming 21-year-old Viggo Kristiansen as his accomplice. As a result, police immediately arrested Kristiansen. The two suspects were close friends, had served in the military Home Guard together and had been seen by witnesses near the crime scene on the day of the murders.|$|E
25|$|The accompaniments...are {{delightful}} to hear, {{and especially}} does {{the treatment of}} the woodwind compel admiring attention. Schubert <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> hardly have handled those instruments more deftly, written for them more lovingly.... We place the songs and choruses in The Yeomen of the Guard before all his previous efforts of this particular kind. Thus the music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage. (Allen, p. 312).|$|E
25|$|His {{international}} {{career was}} also affected by his strong Christian beliefs, as {{he refused to}} play on Sundays. Although he was selected for the 1987 and 1991 All Black World Cup squads, he missed three Sunday games in the 1991 tournament due to his religious beliefs. Jones was omitted from the 1995 squad {{as he would have}} been unavailable for the quarterfinal and semifinal games. He was once asked how a Christian such as <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> be such an uncompromising tackler. In reply he quoted a phrase from the Bible: is better to give than receive.|$|E

25|$|In {{designing}} the Mystics, Froud portrayed {{them as being}} more connected to the natural world than their Skeksis counterparts. Henson intended to convey {{the idea that they}} were purged of all materialistic urges, yet were incapable of acting in the real world. Froud also incorporated geometric symbolism throughout the film in order to hint at the implied unity of the two races. The Mystics were the hardest creatures to perform, as the actors had to walk on their haunches with their right arm extended forward, with the full weight of the head on it. Henson <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> hold a position in a Mystic costume for only 5–10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the high}} level of public {{interest}} in the outcome of the trial, Scottish broadcaster STV wrote to the then Lord Justice General, Lord Hamilton, requesting permission to film the sentencing of Gilroy. On 10 April 2012, it was announced that the sentencing diet would be filmed by a camera crew from STV and the footage made freely available to broadcasters for use on the same day. Strict conditions were placed on what could be filmed. The Lord Justice General stipulated that the camera should focus solely on the trial judge and court staff and that Gilroy <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> not be filmed. In addition, it was reported that filming would only commence after Jack Davidson QC had finished delivering his plea in mitigation.|$|E
25|$|He {{was among}} those who asked Marshal Pedro de Garibay to assume the {{position}} of viceroy after the coup that deposed José de Iturrigaray. Garibay did so, but when the Junta de Aranjuez became aware of his advanced age {{and the fact that he}} was a puppet of the rich merchants and the Real Audiencia, they named Archbishop Lizana to replace him on an interim basis (February 1809). The archbishop was chosen because the Junta was aware that Catholics did not support Napoleon after the imprisonment of Pope Pius VII in 1809. Lizana named his cousin, Inquisitor Juan Sáenz de Alfaro, to handle his ecclesiastical duties so that Lizana <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> concentrate on his political duties. Sáenz de Alfaro was not a popular choice.|$|E

25|$|After {{the events}} of the Brightest Day, Alan {{and the rest of the}} JSA travel to the city of Monument Point, which has been {{attacked}} by a superpowered terrorist named Scythe. Just before being defeated, Scythe snaps Alan's neck. In the subsequent story, it is revealed that Scythe is the product of Nazi genetic engineering, and that Alan and Jay had been tasked by the president with killing the experiment back when he was in infancy during World War 2. The two heroes could not agree on a course of action, and, as a result, Scythe was allowed to live. Doctor Mid-Nite discovers that the injuries Alan sustained have rendered him paralyzed, and that any attempt to heal <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> break his constant concentration, which could result in the Starheart once again regaining control of his body.|$|E
25|$|Upon Jutta's {{death in}} 1136, Hildegard was {{unanimously}} elected as magistra {{of the community}} by her fellow nuns. Abbot Kuno of Disibodenberg asked Hildegard to be Prioress, which would be under his authority. Hildegard, however, wanted more independence {{for herself and her}} nuns, and asked Abbot Kuno to allow them to move to Rupertsberg. This was to be a move towards poverty, from a stone complex that was well established to a temporary dwelling place. When the abbot declined Hildegard's proposition, Hildegard went over his head and received the approval of Archbishop Henry I of Mainz. Abbot Kuno did not relent until Hildegard was stricken by an illness that kept her paralyzed and unable to move from her bed, an event that she attributed to God's unhappiness at her not following his orders to move her nuns to Rupertsberg. It was only when the Abbot <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> not move Hildegard that he decided to grant the nuns their own monastery. Hildegard and about twenty nuns thus moved to the St. Rupertsberg monastery in 1150, where Volmar served as provost, as well as Hildegard's confessor and scribe. In 1165 Hildegard founded a second monastery for her nuns at Eibingen.|$|E
25|$|The magistrate's role in {{practice}} faced many other constraints. The runners and yamen officials who {{were sent to}} investigate a crime were locals, often in league with the criminals. Magistrates commonly would therefore set a deadline for bringing in the criminals, threatening to take the policeman's family members as hostage if the deadline was not met. When the accused was brought before him, the magistrate could use torture, such as flogging or making the defendant kneel on an iron chain, but there were clear restrictions. The instruments had to be of a standard size and individually approved by the next higher yamen, and some {{could not be used}} on women or people over the age of seventy. The magistrate could order the use of the ankle-squeezer, for instance, only in cases of murder and robbery, and its use had to be specifically reported to the higher level. Some officials avoided the use of torture because they feared that it would produce false confessions. The magistrate had to make sure that any confession was recorded accurately, word for word, to prevent the clerk from introducing intentional errors that might prejudice the case. The magistrate <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> be punished if he invoked the wrong law or imposed a sentence that was either too harsh or too lenient.|$|E

25|$|In March 1768, Ming Rui {{began his}} retreat, pursued by a Burmese army of 10,000 men and 2000 cavalry. The Burmese {{then tried to}} {{encircle}} the Chinese by splitting the army into two. Maha Thiha Thura had now assumed the overall command, replacing Maha Sithu. The smaller army, led by Maha Sithu, continued to pursue Ming Rui while the larger army led by Maha Thiha Thura advanced through the mountainous route to emerge directly behind the Chinese. Through careful maneuvering, the Burmese managed to achieve complete encirclement of the Chinese at modern-day Pyinoolwin (Maymyo), about 50 miles northeast of Ava. Over the course of three days of bloody fighting, the Bannerman army was completely annihilated. The slaughter was such that the Burmese could hardly grip their swords as the hilts were slippery with enemy blood. Of the original 30,000 men of the main army, only 2500 remained alive and were captured. The rest had been killed either on the battlefield, through disease or through execution after their surrender. Ming Rui himself was severely wounded in battle. Only a small group managed to break through and escaped the carnage. Ming Rui <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> have escaped with that group. Instead, he cut off his queue {{and sent it to}} the emperor as a token of his loyalty by those who were escaping. He then hanged himself on a tree. In the end, only a few dozen of the main army returned.|$|E
500|$|Sir Henry Wood was {{surprised}} to hear Busoni playing passages in a Mozart concerto, written as single notes, with two hands in double octaves; at which Donald Tovey proclaimed Busoni [...] "to be an absolute purist in not confining himself strictly to Mozart's written text", that is, that Mozart <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> have taken similar liberties. The musicologist Percy Scholes wrote that [...] "Busoni, from his perfect command over every means of expression and his complete consideration of every phrase in a composition to every other phrase and to the whole, was the truest artist of all the pianists [...] had ever heard." ...|$|E
500|$|In many of Shinkai's films, sad endings {{resulting}} from misunderstandings and unrequited feelings are common. According to Shinkai, his stories {{are intended to}} encourage teenagers as they learn to cope with these commonplace experiences. In an interview, {{he admitted that he}} had been accustomed to being turned down by women, and felt that his stories were encouraging because his characters continue to try, despite being unsuccessful at love. The Garden of Words also illustrated how people do not mature as linearly or elegantly as we often assume. Shinkai <b>himself</b> <b>could</b> relate with Yukari in not feeling as smart or mature at age 27, stating, [...] "We're all still just children at age 27," [...] a point that voice actress Kana Hanazawa also agreed with.|$|E
