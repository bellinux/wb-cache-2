5|$|Wallis, Duchess of Windsor (born Bessie Wallis Warfield; {{also known}} by her married names of Wallis Spencer and Wallis Simpson; 19 June 1896– 24 April 1986) was an American socialite whose {{intended}} marriage to King Edward VIII {{caused him to}} abdicate <b>his</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had {{encouraged}} the escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, {{it is more likely that}} she was protecting herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn his daughter to a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over <b>his</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E

5|$|Andrew Báthory lost <b>his</b> <b>throne</b> and {{his life}} {{fighting}} against Michael the Brave and his Székely allies in autumn. Michael the Brave administered Transylvania as RudolphII's governor, but his rule was unpopular among the noblemen, especially because of the pillaging raids made by his unpaid soldiers. As early as 9February 1600 Sigismund {{announced that he was}} ready to return to Transylvania. Moses Székely, a commander-in-chief during Michael the Brave's campaign against Moldavia in May, deserted Michael and came to Poland to meet Sigismund.|$|E
5|$|Cædwalla sent Wilfrid to the Isle of Wight, {{which was}} still pagan, {{with the aim of}} {{converting}} the inhabitants. The king also gave Wilfrid a quarter of the land on the island as a gift. In 688, the king relinquished <b>his</b> <b>throne</b> and went on a pilgrimage to Rome to be baptised, but died shortly after the ceremony. Wilfrid was probably influential in Cædwalla's decision to be baptised in Rome.|$|E
5|$|Ecgric's successor, Anna, {{acted as}} a {{challenge}} to the increasing power of Penda throughout his reign. In 645, after Cenwalh of Wessex had renounced his wife, who was Penda's sister, Penda drove him from his kingdom and into exile. Anna was strong enough to offer protection to Cenwalh when he sought refuge at the East Anglian court: whilst there he was converted to Christianity, returning in 648 to rule Wessex as a Christian king. Anna probably provided military support for Cenwalh's return to <b>his</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E

5|$|Elton {{does not}} believe Bosworth Field has any true significance, {{pointing}} out that the 20th-century English public largely ignored the battle until its quincentennial celebration. In his view, the dearth of specific information about the battle—no-one even knows exactly where it took place—demonstrates its insignificance to English society. Elton considers the battle as just one part of Henry's struggles to establish his reign, underscoring his point by noting that the young king had to spend ten more years pacifying factions and rebellions to secure <b>his</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E
5|$|Nhất Hạnh {{has also}} been a leader in the Engaged Buddhism {{movement}} (he coined the term), promoting the individual's active role in creating change.

Rupert moved on, having placed his brother Charles Louis in some diplomatic difficulties with Spain. Rupert travelled onwards, continuing to attempt to convince Ferdinand to back Charles II's efforts to regain <b>his</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E
5|$|Stephen IV {{attempted}} to regain <b>his</b> <b>throne</b> with Emperor Manuel I's support, but the latter {{made peace with}} Stephen III. He agreed to send his younger brother, Béla, to Constantinople and to allow the Byzantines to seize Béla's duchy, which included Croatia, Dalmatia and Sirmium. In an attempt to recapture these territories, Stephen III waged wars against the Byzantine Empire between 1164 and 1167, but could not defeat the Byzantines.|$|E
5|$|The {{struggle}} between Basiliscus and Zeno impeded the Eastern Roman Empire's ability {{to intervene in}} the fall of the Western Roman Empire, which happened in early September 476.

50|$|Heroes I and II {{take place}} on the planet of Enroth, on a northerly {{continent}} of the same name, and chronicle the adventures of the Ironfist dynasty.

5|$|There {{are also}} hagiographies of {{previous}} Zagwe dynastic rulers composed during the Solomonic period. For instance, {{during the reign}} of Zara Yaqob (1434–1468) a chronicle focusing on Gebre Mesqel Lalibela (r. 1185–1225) portrayed him as a Christian saint who performed miracles. Conveniently for the legitimacy of the Solomonic dynasty, the chronicle stated that Lalibela did not desire for his heirs to inherit <b>his</b> <b>throne.</b>|$|E
5|$|Tipu Sultan {{identified}} himself with tigers; his personal epithet was 'The Tiger of Mysore,' his soldiers {{were dressed in}} 'tyger' jackets, his personal symbol invoked a tiger's face through clever use of calligraphy and the tiger motif is visible on <b>his</b> <b>throne,</b> and other objects in his personal possession, including Tipu's Tiger. Accordingly, as per Joseph Sramek, for Tipu the tiger striking down the European in the organ represented his symbolic triumph over the British.|$|E
5|$|A {{stretch of}} land {{containing}} the later strategic strongholds of Amida (Diyarbakır, Turkey) and Bezabde came under firm Roman military occupation. With these territories, Rome {{would have an}} advance station north of Ctesiphon, and {{would be able to}} slow any future advance of Persian forces through the region. Many cities east of the Tigris came under Roman control, including Tigranokert, Saird, Martyropolis, Balalesa, Moxos, Daudia, and Arzan– though under what status is unclear. At the conclusion of the peace, Tiridates regained both <b>his</b> <b>throne</b> and the entirety of his ancestral claim. Rome secured a wide zone of cultural influence, which led to a wide diffusion of Syriac Christianity from a center at Nisibis in later decades, and the eventual Christianization of Armenia.|$|E
