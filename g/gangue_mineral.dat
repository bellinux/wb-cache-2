40|$|The {{leaching}} {{characteristics of}} four different ores in sulfuric acid systems pressurized with oxygen are described. The {{variations in the}} leaching characteristics between different ores can be largely attributed to differences in mineralogy. Certain <b>gangue</b> <b>mineral</b> alteration phases produced during leaching may trap copper from solution, as well as reduce the porosity of the ore. In addition, the formation of secondary copper sulfides, digenite, and covellite may limit the extraction of copper if the supply of oxygen is restricted to chalcopyrite. Apparently, the key consideration for successful leaching is maximizing the rate of oxidation of the sulfides and, at the same time, minimizing the rate of <b>gangue</b> <b>mineral</b> alteration. This can be accomplished at high oxygen pressures and moderate temperatures (70 to 90 $sup 0 $C) and low pH (less {{than or equal to}} 2. 0). The ideal ore mineralogy is one that is low in carbonates and easily altered Fe-Mg minerals such as biotite and hornblende, and one that has acceptable pyrite/chalcopyrite ratios. (auth...|$|E

40|$|A {{test system}} for water flow in {{granular}} <b>gangue</b> <b>mineral</b> {{was designed to}} study the flow characteristics by compaction treatment. With the increase of the compaction displacement, the porosity decreases and void in granular gangue becomes less. The main reason causing initial porosity decrease is that the void of larger size is filled with small particles. Permeability tends to decrease and non-Darcy flow factor increases under the compaction treatment. The change trend of flow characteristics shows twists and turns, which indicate that flow characteristics of granular <b>gangue</b> <b>mineral</b> are related to compaction level, grain size distribution, crushing, and fracture structure. During compaction, larger particles are crushed, which in turn causes the weight of smaller particles to increase, and water flow induces fine particles to migrate (weight loss); meanwhile, a sample with more weight of size (0 – 2. 5 [*]mm) has a higher amount of weight loss. Water seepage will cause the decrease of some chemical components, where SiO 2 decreased the highest in these components; the components decreased are more likely locked at fragments rather than the defect of the minerals. The variation of the chemical components has an opposite trend when compared with permeability...|$|E

The content of MgO and SiO 2, main gangue components, reached 57. 89 %. The key {{to improve the}} separation indexes of flotation concentrate was to inhibit the <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> effectively, therefore, the effects {{of different kinds of}} regulators on Jinchuan high grade copper-nickel ores by flotation were studied. Considering the grade and recovery of concentrate comprehensively, the optimal regulator of mineral flotation was determined to be the combination of sodium hexametaphosphate and citric acid, and the dosage were 300 g/t and 500 g/t, respectively. After analyzing the mechanism of the two regulators, the combined reagents could reduce the isoelectric point of <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals,</b> decreasing the adsorption between <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> and valuable minerals. In addition, the reagents were able to eliminate the activation of useless ions such as Ca 2 + and Ni 2 + on the <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> and improve the ion composition of pulp, increasing the difference of floatability between <b>gangue</b> and useful <b>minerals...</b>|$|R
40|$|The large {{proportion}} of <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> present in platinum bearing ores in South Africa provides challenges to the flotation and down stream processes. In order to take effective measures to reduce their recovery in flotation {{an understanding of the}} mechanisms and factors influencing their behaviour is needed. Typical <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> are pyroxene, feldspar, quartz, chromite and talc. Of these, talc is a naturally hydrophobic mineral and although it is present in relatively small quantities, it has a disproportionate effect as it has a strong froth stabilizing effect, increasing the recovery of other <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> by entrainment. Talc recovery is effectively reduced with the addition of polymeric depressants. Although the other <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> are assumed to be hydrophilic and their recovery by entrainment is expected to follow the water recovery, {{there is some evidence that}} they may be activated by the typical reagent suites used. Reagents such as copper sulphate, added as an activator, and collectors are used to selectively induce hydrophobicity on the sulphides. It has been shown that some of these <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> can be activated. This research work investigates whether inadvertent copper activation is mineral specific and evaluates the mechanisms and factors affecting the reversal of activation with the addition of the depressants using electrokinetic measurements, adsorption and microflotation tests.

40|$|The Ersmarksberget gold {{mineralisation}} {{occurs in}} north-south striking, discontinuous quartz veins in the contact between a tonalitic intrusion (Juktan dome) and metagreywackes {{in the northern}} part of the Bothnian Basin, northern Sweden. The mineralisation is localised within sulphide and organic matter rich metasedimentary rocks. Metallurgical test work on the mineralisation produced low gold recoveries. Comprehensive ore mineralogy is essential for the gold recovery process. Forty polished thin sections were analysed using optical ore microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and the electron microprobe microanalyser. These analyses revealed that gold occurs as electrum with an Au:Ag ratio of approximately 5 : 1. The electrum occurs as free grains within quartz grain boundaries, intergrown with arsenopyrite crystals, filling in micro fractures and voids in the silicate matrix and arsenopyrite crystals, and clustered around the arsenopyrite-quartz grain boundaries. Arsenopyrite is the only sulphide associated with detectable electrum. The electrum has varying particle sizes ranging from less than 10 microns to more than 100 microns. A good fraction of the electrum is also submicroscopic. The <b>gangue</b> <b>minerals</b> include arsenopyrite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, calcite, graphite and quartz.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 117 - 123. The {{flotation}} {{properties of}} pyrite {{were found to}} be significantly influenced by variations in the pH. In acidic solutions the pyrite floatability is very high, and recoveries of 95 % could be achieved using only a frother. A sharp decrease in floatability was observed in alkaline solutions, possibly due to the formation of hydrophilic ferric hydroxide. The addition of a xanthate collector improved the flotation properties of pyrite at all pHs. In acidic solutions the main effect observed was on the rate of pyrite recovery and on the grade of the concentrates. In alkaline solutions the addition of a xanthate collector improved the final recovery, the rate of flotation and the grades. Variations in the pH had no effect on the recovery of pyrite to which xanthate was added.

40|$|Cyanide is {{the most}} {{commonly}} used depressant to reject pyrite as a <b>gangue</b> <b>mineral</b> at alkaline pH in differential flotation. However, the depression mechanism of cyanide still remains uncertain. The depression effect has been proposed as the preferential adsorption of cyano species on pyrite, which has, however, not been confirmed experimentally. It is also believed that cyanide inhibits the chemisorption of thiol collectors due to the decrease of surface redox potential. In order to clarify the controversial depression mechanisms, the interactions between pyrite and cyanide at pH 10 were investigated in this study. Preferential adsorption of cyanide on pyrite rather than the decrease of surface redox potential was determined to be the depression contributor. Surface cyanoferric species were identified, both electrochemically and spectroscopically, on pyrite surface in the presence of cyanide, inhibiting the oxidation of pyrite and the oxidation/chemisorption of xanthate.

Distinct correlations are observed between the adsorbed layer properties and the flotation performance of the polymers.

40|$|Pyrite is a <b>gangue</b> <b>mineral</b> widely {{associated}} with valuable minerals.

Pyrite may float due to natural or self-induced hydrophobicity or collector-induced hydrophobicity.

In this article, a comprehensive review of the fundamental studies of depression mechanisms and effectiveness of commonly used reagent systems to depress pyrite is presented.

Overall, the action of pyrite depressants is either to desorb the collector or activator from pyrite surface, deactivate the activating ions, prevent collector adsorption on pyrite, or make the pyrite surface hydrophilic.
