5|$|The Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line uses a {{completely}} separate and independently operated fleet as it uses cable car-based automated <b>guideway</b> transit technology. It uses four Cable Liner trains built by DCC Doppelmayr Cable Car, arranged as three-car sets, {{but the system}} can accommodate four-car trains in the future.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the light}} rail {{extension}} began in 2012 and will be completed in 2021. Construction on the station began in 2016 and will be completed in 2020; a $174 million contract was awarded to Absher Construction in August 2016 to build the station and approaching elevated <b>guideway.</b> On January 13, 2017, Sound Transit broke ground on the station, beginning construction with the demolition of two parking lots.|$|E
5|$|The Concord-Daly City {{line was}} {{extended}} to North Concord/Martinez in 1995 and to Colma and Pittsburg/Bay Point in 1996. BART's fifth route, the Dublin/Pleasanton–Daly City line, began when the branch to Dublin/Pleasanton opened in 1997. The San Mateo County line was extended south from Colma to San Francisco International Airport and Millbrae in 2003. BART passengers can reach Oakland International Airport on BART's new automated <b>guideway</b> transit (AGT) system, the Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{awarded the}} {{construction}} contract for Mount Baker {{station and the}} Beacon Hill Tunnel to Japanese general contractors Obayashi Corporation in June 2004 for $280 million, the costliest component of the Central Link project. Construction began in September 2005 with the permanent closure of Stevens Street and utility relocation to clear the station site. By the following April, Obayashi completed erection of columns {{that would be used}} to support the elevated <b>guideway</b> and station. Mount Baker station was declared substantially complete in June 2009, excluding work on the elevators and escalators.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the AirTrain case appeal was decided in October 2000, two-thirds of the system's viaduct {{structures}} had been constructed already. The system was ready for its first test trains by December 2000. The state spent $75 million to renovate the Howard Beach station, which brought it into ADA compliance and facilitated passengers' transfers {{to and from the}} AirTrain. The new Howard Beach station was completed in May 2001. The Port Authority also contributed $100 million toward the renovation of the Jamaica LIRR station, with the State of New York paying {{for the rest of the}} $387 million project. The purpose of this renovation was, in part, to facilitate AirTrain connections. The renovation of the Jamaica station started in May 2001 upon the completion of the Howard Beach station. By this time, the system's <b>guideway</b> rails were complete and the guideways were being constructed. The first two AirTrain cars were delivered in March 2001 and were undergoing testing at the AirTrain maintenance facility near Lefferts Boulevard. The guideways were completed in August 2001. However, a parking structure, proposed near the Jamaica terminal as part of a long-term plan to redevelop downtown Jamaica, was largely unfunded by 2002, the year the AirTrain was originally supposed to open.|$|E
25|$|Guideways {{were made}} of {{concrete}} and based on highway construction techniques. The varying topography of the airport resulted in both aerial and ground level guideways winding their way over and under public roadways. As the <b>guideway</b> entered the semicircular terminals or remote parking areas, it remained at ground/ramp level and under the terminal building. At these terminal areas the <b>guideway</b> branched out to serve various stations, bypass tracks and vehicle storage sidings. Additional bypass guideways were constructed as the airport expanded. At several locations along the <b>guideway</b> tug sidings were located near the airport service road, allowing a disabled vehicle {{to be removed from}} the <b>guideway</b> and towed to the maintenance facility.|$|E
25|$|The <b>guideway</b> was uni-directional, {{with all}} {{vehicles}} {{traveling around the}} airport in a counter-clockwise direction. The top of <b>guideway</b> walls contained rails that steered the vehicles. Small urethane wheels {{on either side of}} the vehicle engaged the rail and were mechanically linked to a conventional steering suspension on the main wheels. Switching was provided by switching bars {{on either side of the}} <b>guideway</b> that raised or lowered to trap one of the two sets of guidance wheels under them. The switch was adapted from existing fail-safe switches used on railways.|$|E
25|$|ULTra uses {{on-board}} batteries, recharged at stops. This {{increases the}} safety, {{and reduces the}} complexity, cost and maintenance of the <b>guideway.</b> As a result, a street-level ULTRa <b>guideway</b> resembles a sidewalk with curbs and is very inexpensive to construct. ULTRa resembles a small automated electric car, and uses similar components.|$|E
25|$|Automated <b>guideway</b> transit {{refers to}} guided transit {{vehicles}} operating singly or in multi-car trains with fully automated control (no crew on transit units). Service {{may be on}} a fixed schedule or {{in response to a}} passenger-activated call button. Automated <b>guideway</b> transit includes personal rapid transit, group rapid transit and people mover systems.|$|E
25|$|Two deaths {{related to}} Airtrans {{occurred}} in September 1977. A teenager was killed after jumping {{on top of}} a vehicle from a restricted retaining wall and falling to the <b>guideway,</b> where he was run over by a two-car train. During the same week, a man from Fort Worth was electrocuted and killed when touching a high voltage wire on the <b>guideway.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Dashaveyor was an {{automated}} <b>guideway</b> transit (AGT) system {{developed during the}} 1960s and '70s.|$|E
25|$|The above {{discussion}} compares line or corridor {{capacity and}} may therefore not be relevant for a networked PRT system, where several parallel lines (or parallel {{components of a}} grid) carry traffic. In addition, Muller estimated that while PRT may need more than one <b>guideway</b> to match the capacity of a conventional system, the capital cost of the multiple guideways may still be {{less than that of}} the single <b>guideway</b> conventional system. Thus comparisons of line capacity should also consider the cost per line.|$|E
25|$|After {{the system}} closed in 1995, the {{original}} <b>guideway</b> lay dormant until 2003, when a replacement cable-hauled system, the AirRail Link Cable Liner people mover, was opened.|$|E
25|$|Conversion to an AGT {{system was}} {{relatively}} straightforward. The steel wheels were replaced with rubber ones, which ran {{in a narrow}} concrete <b>guideway</b> structure instead of the I-beam rails. The <b>guideway</b> was roughly {{the size and shape}} of a pedestrian sidewalk, with short vertical extension on either side to form a U-shape. Small horizontal wheels at the front of the cars pressed against the vertical sections and guided the main wheels around corners. Power was provided via a third rail system attached to the top of the right vertical extension (as seen in the direction of travel).|$|E
25|$|In 1977, {{a single}} Airtrans {{passenger}} train {{slammed into the}} back of a two-car employee train, injuring nine people. The vehicle was under manual control to bypass a malfunctioning section of <b>guideway</b> in the South Remote Parking Lot.|$|E
25|$|In Transrapid vehicle {{versions}} TR08 and earlier, when travelling {{at speeds}} below , the vehicle levitation system and all on-board vehicle electronics were supplied with power through physical {{connections to the}} track <b>guideway.</b> At vehicle speeds above , all on-board power was supplied by recovered harmonic oscillation of the magnetic fields created from the track’s linear stator. (Since these oscillations are parasitic, they cannot be used for vehicle propulsion). A new energy transmission system, version TR09, has since been developed for Transrapid, in which maglev vehicles now require no physical contact with the track <b>guideway</b> for their on-board power needs, regardless of the maglev vehicle speed. This feature helps to reduce on-going maintenance and operational costs.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} over the best type of <b>guideway.</b> Proposals include beams similar to monorails, bridge-like trusses {{supporting}} internal tracks, and cables embedded in a roadway. Most designs put the vehicle {{on top of the}} track, which reduces visual intrusion and cost as well as easing ground-level installation. An overhead track is necessarily higher, but may also be narrower. Most designs use the <b>guideway</b> to distribute power and data communications, including to the vehicles. The Morgantown PRT failed its cost targets because of its steam-heated track, so most proposals plan to resist snow and ice in ways that should be less expensive. Masdar's system has been limited because it attempted to dedicate ground-level to PRT guideways. This led to unrealistically expensive buildings and roads.|$|E
25|$|In {{simulations}} of rush hour or high-traffic events, {{about one-third of}} vehicles on the <b>guideway</b> need to travel empty to resupply stations with vehicles {{in order to minimize}} response time. This is analogous to trains and buses travelling nearly empty on the return trip to pick up more rush hour passengers.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{rapid transit}} (PRT), also {{referred}} to as podcars, is a public transport mode featuring small automated vehicles operating on a network of specially built guideways. PRT is a type of automated <b>guideway</b> transit (AGT), a class of system which also includes larger vehicles all the way to small subway systems.|$|E
25|$|Maintenance: Maglev trains {{currently}} in operation {{have demonstrated the}} need for minimal <b>guideway</b> maintenance. Vehicle maintenance is also minimal (based on hours of operation, rather than on speed or distance traveled). Traditional rail is subject to mechanical wear and tear that increases exponentially with speed, also increasing maintenance.|$|E
25|$|Airtrans {{was built}} to serve 53 passenger, {{employee}} and service stations around the airport, 33 of those for passengers and employees. Each terminal contained 3 passenger stations corresponding to that terminal's section (for example, Terminal 2E Section 1) located adjacent to the lower level terminal drive. These passenger stations contained an enclosed waiting area, destination signage, two sets of bi-parting automatic doors (with room for a third) and elevators to upper level ticketing/baggage claim. In early years of operation entry to the station was gained by placing a quarter in and passing through entry turnstiles. An employee station for each terminal section was located on a separate <b>guideway</b> adjacent to the terminal's ramp area, and screened from passenger view. These stations were more primitive, containing an outdoor waiting area with a fence and no automatic doors preventing access to the electrified <b>guideway.</b>|$|E
25|$|An earlier transit system, {{that opened}} in 1983 to link the main {{terminal}} (now the South Terminal) to the (then new) circular satellite pier, was the UK's first automated people-moving system. This system has since {{been replaced by a}} walkway-and-moving walkway link, although the remains of the elevated <b>guideway</b> are still visible.|$|E
25|$|The Canada Line, {{which was}} opened on August 17, 2009, runs {{underground}} through Vancouver and then along an elevated <b>guideway</b> with two branches, to Richmond and Vancouver International Airport. It meets the Expo Line at Waterfront Station in downtown Vancouver, {{but it is}} operationally independent {{and there is no}} track connection between them.|$|E
25|$|If {{safety or}} access {{considerations}} require {{the addition of}} walkways, ladders, platforms or other emergency/disabled access to or egress from PRT guideways, {{the size of the}} <b>guideway</b> may be increased. This may impact the feasibility of a PRT system, though the degree of impact would depend on both the PRT design and the municipality.|$|E
25|$|Though Oklahoma City has no light-rail or {{commuter}} rail service, city residents identified improved transit {{as one of}} their top priorities and from the fruits of the Fixed <b>Guideway</b> and other studies city leaders strongly desire to incorporate urban rail transit into the region's future transportation plans. The greater Oklahoma City metropolitan transit plan identified from the Fixed <b>Guideway</b> Study includes streetcar in the downtown section that would be fed by enhanced city bus service and {{commuter rail}} from the suburbs including Edmond, Norman, and Midwest City. There is a significant push for a commuter rail line connecting downtown OKC with the eastern suburbs of Del City, Midwest City, and Tinker Air Force Base. In addition to commuter rail, a short heritage rail line that would run from Bricktown just a few blocks away from the Amtrak station to the Adventure District in northeast Oklahoma City is under reconstruction.|$|E
25|$|Spacing of {{vehicles}} on the <b>guideway</b> influences the maximum passenger capacity of a track, so designers prefer smaller headway distances. Computerized control theoretically permits closer spacing than the two-second headways recommended for cars at speed, since multiple vehicles can be braked simultaneously. There are also prototypes for automatic guidance of private cars based on similar principles.|$|E
25|$|The North (1W) and South (5E) Remote Parking areas each {{contained}} two stations; {{an additional}} station served the airport hotel. These stations {{consisted of two}} platforms {{on either side of}} a single guideway: an enclosed passenger station and an exposed employee station. Transfer to either side of the <b>guideway</b> was accommodated by a sheltered elevated or below-station walkway.|$|E
25|$|Personal {{rapid transit}} is an {{automated}} cab service {{that runs on}} rails or a <b>guideway.</b> This is an uncommon mode of transportation (excluding elevators) due {{to the complexity of}} automation. A fully implemented system might provide most of the convenience of individual automobiles with the efficiency of public transit. The crucial innovation is that the automated vehicles carry just a few passengers, turn off the <b>guideway</b> to pick up passengers (permitting other PRT vehicles to continue at full speed), and drop them off to the location of their choice (rather than at a stop). Conventional transit simulations show that PRT might attract many auto users in problematic medium-density urban areas. A number of experimental systems are in progress. One might compare personal rapid transit to the more labor-intensive taxi or paratransit modes of transportation, or to the (by now automated) elevators common in many publicly accessible areas.|$|E
25|$|Weather: Maglev {{trains are}} little {{affected}} by snow, ice, severe cold, rain or high winds. However, {{they have not}} operated in {{the wide range of}} conditions that traditional friction-based rail systems have operated. Maglev vehicles accelerate and decelerate faster than mechanical systems regardless of the slickness of the <b>guideway</b> or the slope of the grade because they are non-contact systems.|$|E
25|$|The South Shanghai {{extension}} {{was expected}} to cost approximately US$18 million per kilometre. In 2006 the German government invested $125 million in <b>guideway</b> cost reduction development that produced an all-concrete modular design that is faster to build and is 30% less costly. Other new construction techniques were also developed that put maglev at or below price parity with new high-speed rail construction.|$|E
25|$|Computer control {{eliminates}} errors {{from human}} drivers, so PRT designs {{in a controlled}} environment should be much safer than private motoring on roads. Most designs enclose the running gear in the <b>guideway</b> to prevent derailments. Grade-separated guideways would prevent conflict with pedestrians or manually controlled vehicles. Other public transit safety engineering approaches, such as redundancy and self-diagnosis of critical systems, are also included in designs.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, while delayed {{in traffic}} on the Throgs Neck Bridge, James Powell, a {{researcher}} at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL), thought of using magnetically levitated transportation. Powell and BNL colleague Gordon Danby worked out a MagLev concept using static magnets mounted on a moving vehicle to induce electrodynamic lifting and stabilizing forces in specially shaped loops, such as figure of 8 coils on a <b>guideway.</b>|$|E
25|$|The updated {{alignment}} {{from the}} 2007 West LRT Report includes the line running on an elevated <b>guideway</b> beginning {{west of the}} Downtown West – Kerby Station, running along the CPR right of way to Bow Trail SW, and then to 24th Street SW. The line then runs at grade past Shaganappi Point Station and drops into a tunnel to 33rd Street SW. The tunnel then runs under the Westbrook Mall parking lot, and the former site of the now-demolished Ernest Manning Senior High School. The line then follows {{the north side of}} 17th Avenue SW past 37th Street SW below grade to 45 Street Station. Past 45th Street the line runs at grade, and approaching Sarcee Trail SW moves onto an elevated <b>guideway</b> that passes over the freeway. The line then runs at grade to Sirocco Station, then proceeds to drop below grade and pass under eastbound 17th Avenue SW at 69th Street SW and return to grade {{on the south side of}} the avenue. The line then terminates at 69 Street Station located to the west of 69th Street SW.|$|E
25|$|A {{streetcar}} line in Anaheim {{is undergoing}} environmental impact assessment. This line will connect the Disneyland Resort, Convention Center, and Angel Stadium to the ARTIC transportation hub, {{in the city}} of Anaheim. The Santa Ana/Garden Grove Fixed <b>Guideway</b> Project plans a streetcar line connecting Downtown Santa Ana to the Depot at Santa Ana has completed the environmental document and is entering the design phase. OCTA has also proposed connecting the two systems via Harbor Boulevard and the West Santa Ana Branch corridor.|$|E
25|$|Three {{possible}} alignments {{were considered}} for the westward extension. The least expensive would follow the railway right-of-way past the Exhibition {{and up to the}} Galt-Weston railway corridor, taking it to Dundas West station. Another alternative would go west of Strachan along the Oakville Subdivision rail lines to Roncesvalles, where it would turn north to connect to the Bloor line at Dundas West. The third alignment considered ran along an elevated <b>guideway</b> on Parkside Drive at the edge of High Park to Keele Station.|$|E
25|$|AirBART, a {{dedicated}} bus line, operated between the current Coliseum Station and the Oakland International Airport. The service was discontinued on November 22, 2014 {{with the opening}} of the Coliseum–Oakland International Airport line automated <b>guideway</b> transit system. AirBART was a joint project of BART and the Port of Oakland, which owns and operates the airport. It was operated by Veolia Transportation under contract. As of December 2009, the AirBART fleet consisted of five Eldorado Axess buses running on compressed natural gas (CNG).|$|E
