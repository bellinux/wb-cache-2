25|$|These {{areas of}} water are {{inhabited}} by Eurasian beaver, which had disappeared {{some years ago}} due to intensive hunting, but which have now recovered their original population. Besides this, it is mostly a richness of birds that distinguishes the park's wetlands. It constitutes the southernmost extent in Sweden of the nesting area of many species, such as the greater scaup, the oldsquaw, the common scoter, and also a focus of important populations of red-necked phalarope, ruff, common <b>greenshank</b> and wood sandpiper. One also finds sometimes the Eurasian curlew, which is considered an endangered species.|$|E
25|$|Bears, foxes, otters, and sables are numerous, as are {{reindeer}} in the north, and musk deer, hares, squirrels, rats, {{and mice}} everywhere. The bird fauna is mostly the common east Siberian, {{but there are}} some endemic or near-endemic breeding species, notably the endangered Nordmann's <b>greenshank</b> (Tringa guttifer) and the Sakhalin leaf warbler (Phylloscopus borealoides). The rivers swarm with fish, especially species of salmon (Oncorhynchus). Numerous whales visit the sea coast, including the critically endangered Western Pacific gray whale, for which the coast of Sakhalin is the only known feeding ground. Other endangered whale species known to occur in this area are the North Pacific right whale, the bowhead whale and the beluga whale.|$|E
500|$|To {{the south}} lie Teal Pool and River Pool, created in 1983 when an earth dam was {{constructed}} {{between the two}} in order that Teal Pool retained water to provide habitat for dabbling duck species, which generally include common teal and mallard.

50|$|Lillsjön {{used to be}} {{connected}} to other lakes in the area through narrow straits. Through a project sponsored by the World Wide Fund for Nature, water was pumped into the small basin reinforced by new embankments. Reed was also burnt away, and the former lake thus transformed into a shore meadow attracting many birds, starting with northern lapwings in March, followed by common snipes later in spring. In autumn, many birds rest here on their way south, such as wood sandpipers, common redshanks, <b>greenshanks,</b> and ruffs.|$|R
50|$|Common <b>greenshanks</b> are {{brown in}} {{breeding}} plumage, and grey-brown in winter. When in water, they can appear {{very similar to}} marsh sandpipers but are distinguished by {{the shape of the}} lower bill which gives it an upturned appearance to the bill. They have long greenish legs and a long bill with a grey base. They show a white wedge on the back in flight. They are somewhat larger than the related common redshank. The usual call is a rapid series of three short fluty notes syllabilized as teu-teu-teu.|$|R

50|$|This 175-hectare wetland, {{comprising}} grasses, {{salt marsh}} and sedges, is fed mainly by water from Laverton Creek, which originates in Truganina. Truganina Swamp provides habitats for two endangered species - the Altona skipper butterfly, which feeds on chaffy saw sedge, and the orange-bellied parrot, which feeds on beaded glasswort and scrubland species of glasswort. The wetland {{is an important}} habitat for migratory wading birds such as pelicans, <b>greenshanks,</b> royal spoonbills and birds from as far as Siberia.
