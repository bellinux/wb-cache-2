40|$|BACKGROUND: Histologic {{grade in}} breast cancer {{provides}} clinically important prognostic information. However, 30 %- 60 % of tumors are classified as histologic grade 2. This grade is associated with an intermediate risk of recurrence and is thus not informative for clinical decision making. We examined whether histologic grade was associated with gene expression profiles of breast cancers and whether such profiles {{could be used to}} improve histologic grading. METHODS: We analyzed microarray data from 189 invasive breast carcinomas and from three published gene expression datasets from breast carcinomas. We identified differentially expressed genes in a training set of 64 estrogen receptor (ER) -positive tumor samples by comparing expression profiles between histologic grade 3 tumors and histologic grade 1 tumors and used the expression of these genes to define the gene expression <b>grade</b> <b>index.</b> Data from 597 independent tumors were used to evaluate the association between relapse-free survival and the gene expression <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> in a Kaplan-Meier analysis. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: We identified 97 genes in our training set that were associated with histologic grade; most of these genes were involved in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. In validation datasets, the gene expression <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> was strongly associated with histologic grade 1 and 3 status; however, among histologic grade 2 tumors, the index spanned the values for histologic grade 1 - 3 tumors. Among patients with histologic grade 2 tumors, a high gene expression <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> was associated with a higher risk of recurrence than a low gene expression <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> (hazard ratio = 3. 61, 95 % confidence interval = 2. 25 to 5. 78; P <. 001, log-rank test). CONCLUSIONS: Gene expression <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> appeared to reclassify patients with histologic grade 2 tumors into two groups with high versus low risks of recurrence. This approach may improve the accuracy of tumor grading and thus its prognostic value...|$|R

40|$|Sixty-three {{straight}} pruned radiata pine butt logs 4. 9 m {{long were}} sawn exclusively to 25 mm boards under a standard pattern in three timber grade studies. Produce was graded by the National Timber Grading Rules (NZS 3631 : 1978) and timber prices from the Waipa Wholesale Price List 1978 were applied. No price {{was available for}} clears so a range of three was used. Variation in the price for clears {{was found to have}} a very significant effect on log values. Because the random occurrence of resin pockets can confound results, basic data used in this paper are from grades produced when resin pockets were ignored. Results showed the production of clearwood and values and grades realised from pruned butt logs are determined by three major factors: log size, defect core size, and log conversion percentage. A <b>Grade</b> <b>Index</b> has been derived in which the relationship of these factors is expressed as: dbh x log conversion <b>Grade</b> <b>Index</b> =. defect core Data from the 3 studies were combined in a <b>Grade</b> <b>Index</b> Model which defines a pruned log value gradient, the expected outturn in clears, and gives an approximation of the proportions in other grades. Results from an independent fourth sample of 12 logs were used to validate the <b>Grade</b> <b>Index</b> Model. Because the <b>Grade</b> <b>Index</b> is an expression of the quality of pruned butt logs which may be used either predictively or reflectively, applications to stand planning, evaluations of silvicultural regimes, and evaluations of existing pruned stands are proposed. Future application of <b>Grade</b> <b>Index</b> to real stands would be facilitated by more detailed forest records on the timing, implementation, and result of pruning operations. Further research into the classification and effect of deviations from straightness in pruned butt logs is also necessary because at present the index is confined to straight logs.

The problem was to determine if age, cumulative <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> of nursing courses, university cumulative <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> upon completion of the program, continuous enrollment in nursing courses, previous college enrollment, and the average grade of three required science courses could be predictors of pass/fail performance of associate degree graduate nurses on the licensing examination. The population of the study were graduates of an associate degree nursing program offered by a small, private liberal arts university in the midwest. The representative sample of the population consisted of 253 associate degree graduate nurses completing the associate degree nursing program and writing the licensing examination during the years 1977 through 1979. One instrument was employed to collect the data. This instrument was constructed by the investigator to record the data pertaining to each factor under investigation. The statistical analysis of the data was performed by using difference in proportion of large samples test, difference in large sample means test following the application of the F test to sample variance, the non-parametric rank sum test, Kruskal-Wallis Test, and two-way analysis of co-variance test. Data pertaining to each factor was organized into two groups, the number of associate degree graduate nurses passing the licensing examination and the number of associate degree graduate nurses failing the licensing examination. Analysis of the data revealed that the mean cumulative <b>grade</b> point <b>index</b> upon completion of the nursing program and the mean cumulative <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> of nursing courses for the group of graduate nurses passing the licensing examination was found to be higher than the mean cumulative <b>grade</b> point <b>index</b> upon completion of the nursing program and the mean cumulative <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> of nursing courses for the group of graduate nurses failing the licensing examination. Mastery of content of nursing courses affected pass/fail performance of associate degree graduate nurses on the licensing examination. Partitioning of graduate nurses into age groups, continuous enrollment in nursing courses, previous college enrollment prior to admission to the nursing program and the average grade of three required science courses did not influence the pass/fail performance of associate degree graduate nurses on the licensing examination. As the result of the findings of the study, it may be concluded that age of the associate degree graduate is not an influencing factor upon pass/fail performance on the licensing examination. Previous college experience, continuous enrollment in nursing courses and high academic performance in science courses do not influence successful performance on the licensing examination. Cumulative <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> of nursing courses as well as university cumulative <b>grade</b> <b>index</b> upon completion of the nursing program, may be the best predictors {{as to whether or not}} the associate degree graduate nurse will pass the licensing examination.
