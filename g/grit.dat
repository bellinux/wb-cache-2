5|$|A gritter, {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the gritter is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread <b>grit</b> (rock salt), onto roads. The <b>grit</b> is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the <b>grit</b> was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require <b>grit</b> be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E

5|$|The {{aim of the}} ducker was to {{get every}} {{duckling}} as fat as possible {{by the age of}} eight weeks (the first moult, the age at which they would be killed for meat), while avoiding any foods which would build up their bones or make their flesh greasy. In their first week after hatching, the ducklings would be fed on boiled eggs, toast soaked in water, boiled rice and beef liver. From the second week on, this diet would gradually be replaced by barley meal and boiled rice mixed with greaves. (Some larger-scale duckers would boil a horse or sheep and feed this to the ducklings in place of greaves.) This high-protein diet was supplemented with nettles, cabbage and lettuce to provide a source of vitamins. As with all poultry, ducks require <b>grit</b> in their diet to break up the food and make it digestible. Aylesbury ducklings' drinking water was laced with <b>grit</b> from Long Marston and Gubblecote; this <b>grit</b> also gave their bills their distinctive pinkish colour. Around 85% of ducklings would survive this eight-week rearing process to be sent to market.|$|E

5|$|As an adult, {{the house}} sparrow mostly feeds on {{the seeds of}} grains and weeds, but it is {{opportunistic}} and adaptable, and eats whatever foods are available. In towns and cities, it often scavenges for food in garbage containers and congregates in the outdoors of restaurants and other eating establishments to feed on leftover food and crumbs. It can perform complex tasks to obtain food, such as opening automatic doors to enter supermarkets, clinging to hotel walls to watch vacationers on their balconies, and nectar robbing kowhai flowers. In common with many other birds, the house sparrow requires <b>grit</b> to digest the harder items in its diet. <b>Grit</b> can be either stone, often grains of masonry, or the shells of eggs or snails; oblong and rough grains are preferred.|$|E

40|$|Open Access JournalThis study {{investigated}} the chemical composition and pasting properties of tapioca <b>grits</b> from different cassava varieties and roasting methods. Tapioca <b>grits</b> (partially gelatinized irregular flakes from roasted cassava starch), were produced from three different cassava varieties (Odongbo, TMS 30572 and Oko-iyawo) and two roasting methods (traditional and rotary dryer). The chemical composition and pasting properties of the tapioca <b>grits</b> were evaluated. The {{results showed that the}} effect of cassava variety and roasting methods on chemical composition of tapioca <b>grits</b> was significantly different (P< 0. 05). The principal component analysis (PCA) of variation in the chemical properties of the tapioca <b>grits</b> indicated that moisture, sugar and starch accounted for 83 % of the variation in the chemical properties of tapioca <b>grits.</b> This study showed that peak and hot paste viscosities are the key pasting parameters in characterizing tapioca <b>grits</b> from the cassava varieties and roasting methods studied and that variation in peak viscosity of the tapioca <b>grits</b> might be due more too varietal influence than the roasting method.

The conventional diamond disks employ similar type of diamond <b>grits</b> across the entire disk. These <b>grits</b> cannot dress and cut the pad with optimization.

Wet and dry <b>grits,</b> as the intermediate products, were investigated in this study. With respect to particle size, wet <b>grits</b> were predominately (66. 7 %) obtained between mesh size 0. 50 and 1. 00 mm, while dry <b>grits</b> (28. 4 %) were between 0. 09 and 0. 25 mm. Higher moisture content of wet <b>grits</b> generally resulted in higher bulk density, static and dynamic angle of repose, but lower particle density and porosity than dry <b>grits.</b> Plywood typically led to the highest {{coefficient of static friction}} of both, wet and dry <b>grits.</b> The transported mass and air velocity fitted well into a sigmoidal model. Due to particle size, terminal velocity of wet and dry <b>grits</b> ranged from 1. 07 to 4. 25 m/s and from 0. 88 to 2. 87 m/s, respectively, whereas conveying velocity ranged from 1. 23 to 6. 47 m/s and from 1. 02 to 3. 70 m/s.

5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} arc welding, {{because it}} affords {{greater control over}} the weld area than other welding processes, can produce high-quality welds when performed by skilled operators. Maximum weld quality is assured by maintaining cleanliness—all equipment and materials used must be free from oil, moisture, dirt and other impurities, as these cause weld porosity and consequently a decrease in weld strength and quality. To remove oil and grease, alcohol or similar commercial solvents may be used, while a stainless steel wire brush or chemical process can remove oxides from the surfaces of metals like aluminum. Rust on steels can be removed by first <b>grit</b> blasting the surface and then using a wire brush to remove any embedded <b>grit.</b> These steps are especially important when negative polarity direct current is used, because such a power supply provides no cleaning during the welding process, unlike positive polarity direct current or alternating current. To maintain a clean weld pool during welding, the shielding gas flow should be sufficient and consistent so that the gas covers the weld and blocks impurities in the atmosphere. GTAW in windy or drafty environments increases the amount of shielding gas necessary to protect the weld, increasing the cost and making the process unpopular outdoors.|$|E

5000|$|Whole kernel <b>grits</b> are {{prepared}} by adding {{five or six}} parts boiling water (seasoned with salt—1/4 tsp for each cup of water) to one part <b>grits</b> and cooking for 20 to 45 minutes. <b>Grits</b> expand when cooked and need periodic stirring to prevent sticking, and lumps from forming. They are not done until they have absorbed four and one quarter times their volume of water. The additional water allows for some evaporation as they cook. Whole grain <b>grits</b> require much longer to become soft than do [...] "quick grits."

Moreover, the <b>grits</b> waste could be incorporated into the soil-cement brick composition up to 20 wt. % as a partial replacement of Portland cement...|$|R
