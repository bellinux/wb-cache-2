5|$|Each {{character}} can summon a specific Eidolon into battle. These summoned creatures include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr. When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party. While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, {{in which the}} Eidolon transforms <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.|$|E
5|$|Emotions {{contains}} influences from mostly 1950s, 1960s and 1970s balladry and gospel, {{as well as}} her continued work of R and soul. The album, while {{praised by}} some as more mature and raw, failed to reach the critical or commercial heights of her debut effort, while selling far less and failed to introduce Carey <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> market. Following these events, Columbia decided to try to market Carey in a similar fashion to her debut, only having her produce a more commercial and radio-friendly album. Their plans were to tone down Carey's vocals, and soften the album's production, leaving a more contemporary pop/R record. Agreeing to the change, Carey and Afanasieff began writing and recording material for her third studio effort, Music Box.|$|E

The opening batsman Sid Barnes—a core member of the 1948 team—was seeking a return to Test cricket. Barnes was known for being a {{somewhat}} eccentric self-promoter. During the 1948 tour, Barnes organised a multitude of business deals while not playing cricket, and avoided paying customs duties on the enormous amount of goods he acquired in Britain by disembarking at Melbourne instead of Sydney.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{organized}} {{as a part}} of the 95th Infantry Division for World War I, the brigade never saw combat in that conflict. Kept active and in the reserve through much of the 20th century, the brigade in name was reorganized <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> unit for fighting during World War II. Seeing numerous moves, activations and deactivations, the brigade has been used principally as a training unit for most of its existence. Reactivated again in 2006, the brigade is now primarily responsible for training provincial reconstruction teams and their supporting elements for deployment to the War in Afghanistan.|$|E

Over two days of filming, approximately 1,500 extras were used. At each successive take, the extras were rearranged and moved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> quadrant away from the camera. With the help of computers, the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of several hundred thousand people.|$|E

5|$|This {{debate is}} also of {{importance}} when classifying the trust as either constructive or express, {{a matter of}} considerable debate. On one view, if the traditional theory is correct, secret trusts are created by the courts, and are thus constructive; if the more modern view is correct, the trusts exist without the court's permission, and are express trusts. However, a secret trust {{does not have to}} obey the separate formalities of the Law of Property Act 1925, even when it concerns land and one solution to this problem is to consider them constructive. Some commentators believe that half-secret trusts may fall <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> category to fully secret trusts in this regard.|$|E
5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not know when the show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|Davis was 47 {{years old}} when he was asked to play Carnegie Hall in 1974, which {{followed}} four years of relentless touring. He had played the venue numerous times before and recorded a live album there in 1961. By 1974, Davis had been dealing with depression, cocaine and sex addictions, and several health problems, including osteoarthritis, bursitis, and sickle-cell anemia. He had also lost respect with both critics and his contemporaries because of his musical explorations into more rock- and funk-oriented sounds. Influenced by Karlheinz Stockhausen, Davis wanted to avoid individual songs and instead record extended movements that developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> composition. He played his trumpet sparsely and became less of the focal point for his band, whom he allowed more freedom to improvise and with whom he rarely rehearsed, so that the young musicians he enlisted would be tested to learn and play together onstage.|$|E

5|$|In Cocoon, the {{citizens}} of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, after coming in contact with something from Pulse. Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous thirteen days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah. As Snow leads his resistance group NORA to rescue the Purge exiles, several of them are killed. Heading to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, Snow is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two parties meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as she turns to crystal. Anima then brands them as l'Cie and they are cast out <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> part of Cocoon. During this transformation, the newly crested l'Cie all have the same vision: a monster called Ragnarok. Arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus, the party finds Serah in her crystallized form; Snow remains with her as the others leave.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{has been}} {{classified}} into numerous families and subfamilies; in 1858 British entomologist Frederick Smith {{placed it in}} the family Poneridae, subfamily Myrmicidae. It {{was placed in the}} subfamily Ponerinae by Austrian entomologist Gustav Mayr in 1862. This classification was short-lived, as Mayr reclassified the genus into the subfamily Myrmicinae three years later. In 1877, Italian entomologist Carlo Emery classified the genus into the newly established subfamily Myrmeciidae, family Myrmicidae. Smith, who had originally established Myrmicidae as a family in 1851, reclassified it as a subfamily in 1858. He would again treat it as a family in 1871. Swiss myrmecologist Auguste Forel initially treated Poneridae as a subfamily and classified Myrmecia as one of its constituent genera, but later placed it in Ponerinae. William H. Ashemad placed the genus in the subfamily Myrmeciinae in 1905, but it was later placed back in Ponerinae in 1910 by American entomologist William Morton Wheeler. In 1954, Myrmecia was placed into Myrmeciinae; this would be the last time the genus would be placed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> ant subfamily.|$|E
5|$|Planetesimals {{within the}} region which would become the {{asteroid}} belt were too strongly perturbed by Jupiter's gravity to form a planet. Instead they continued to orbit the Sun as before, occasionally colliding. In regions where the average velocity of the collisions was too high, the shattering of planetesimals tended to dominate over accretion, preventing the formation of planet-sized bodies. Orbital resonances occurred where the orbital period of an object in the belt formed an integer fraction of the orbital period of Jupiter, perturbing the object <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>different</b> orbit; the region lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter contains many such orbital resonances. As Jupiter migrated inward following its formation, these resonances would have swept across the asteroid belt, dynamically exciting the region's population and increasing their velocities relative to each other.|$|E
