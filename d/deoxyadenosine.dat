If DNA was present, it was {{composed}} of four nucleotides (<b>deoxyadenosine,</b> deoxycytidine, deoxythymidine, and deoxyguanosine), to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerase. The integrity of the DNA was maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including DNA topoisomerase, DNA ligase and other DNA repair enzymes. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of three-nucleotide codons, thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 amino acids were used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids.|$|E

40|$|Homonucleotide runs in coding {{sequences}} are {{hot spots}} for frameshift mutations and {{potential sources of}} genetic changes leading to cancer in humans having a mismatch repair defect. We examined frameshift mutations in homonucleotide runs of <b>deoxyadenosines</b> ranging from 4 to 14 bases at the same position in the LYS 2 gene of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In the msh 2 mismatch repair mutant, runs of 9 to 14 <b>deoxyadenosines</b> are 1, 700 -fold to 51, 000 -fold, respectively, more mutable for single-nucleotide deletions than are runs of 4 <b>deoxyadenosines.</b> These frameshift mutations can account for up to 99 % of all forward mutations inactivating the 4 -kb LYS 2 gene. Based on results with single and double mutations of the POL 2 and MSH 2 genes, both DNA polymerase epsilon proofreading and mismatch repair are efficient for short runs while only the mismatch repair system prevents frameshift mutations in runs of > or = 8 nucleotides. Therefore, coding sequences containing long homonucleotide runs {{are likely to be}} at risk for mutational inactivation in cells lacking mismatch repair capability...|$|R

40|$|We {{report a}} pH-dependent {{conformational}} transition in short, defined homopolymeric <b>deoxyadenosines</b> (dA 15) {{from a single}} helical structure with stacked nucleobases at neutral pH to a double-helical, parallel-stranded duplex held together by AH+-H+A base pairs at acidic pH. Using native PAGE, 2 D NMR, circular dichroism (CD) and fluorescence spectroscopy, we have characterized the two different pH dependent forms of dA 15. The pH-triggered transition between the two defined helical forms of dA 15 is characterized by CD and fluorescence. The kinetics of this conformational switch is found to occur on a millisecond time scale.

The sensitivity of the micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC) method was increased by using two preconcentration techniques, micro solid-phase extraction (μSPE) followed by reversedelectrode-polarity stacking mode (REPSM). Variables that affect {{the efficiency of the}} extraction in μSPE and preconcentration by REPSM, including the type and volume of extraction nanoparticle, concentration, and injection time, were investigated. Under the optimum conditions, enrichment factors obtained were in the range 360 – 400. The limits of detection (LODs) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 ranged from 2 to 5 nmol L− 1.

40|$|The HGF gene is transcriptionally silenced {{in normal}} {{differentiated}} breast epithelial cells, but its repression fails {{to occur in}} mammary carcinoma tissues and cell lines. The molecular mechanisms underpinning aberrant HGF expression in breast cancer cells are unknown. Here we report {{the discovery of a}} DNA element located 750 bp upstream from the transcription start site in the human HGF promoter that acts as a transcriptional repressor and is a target of deletion mutagenesis in human breast cancer cells and tissues. This HGF promoter element consists of a mononucleotide repeat of 30 <b>deoxyadenosines</b> (30 As), which we have termed “deoxyadenosine tract element” (DATE). Functional studies revealed that truncation mutations within DATE have profound local and global effects on the HGF promoter region by modulating chromatin structure and DNA-protein interactions, leading to constitutive activation of the HGF promoter in human breast carcinoma cell lines. We found that 51 % of African Americans and 15 % of individuals of mixed European descent with breast cancer harbor a truncated DATE variant (25 As or fewer) in their breast tumors and that the truncated allele is associated with cancer incidence and aberrant HGF expression. Notably, breast cancer patients with the truncated DATE variant are substantially younger than those with a wild-type genotype. We also suggest that DATE may be used as a potential genetic marker to identify individuals with a higher risk of developing breast cancer...|$|R

50|$|<b>Deoxyadenosine</b> {{diphosphate}} is a nucleoside diphosphate. It {{is related}} to the common nucleic acid ATP, or adenosine triphosphate, with the -OH (hydroxyl) group on the 2' carbon on the nucleotide's pentose removed (hence the deoxy- part of the name), and with one fewer phosphoryl group than ATP.

50|$|Depurination is a {{chemical}} reaction of purine deoxyribonucleosides, <b>deoxyadenosine</b> and deoxyguanosine, and ribonucleosides, adenosine or guanosine, {{in which the}} β-N-glycosidic bond is hydrolytically cleaved releasing a nucleic base, adenine or guanine, respectively. The second product of depurination of deoxyribonucleosides and ribonucleosides is sugar, 2’-deoxyribose and ribose, respectively. More complex compounds containing nucleoside residues, nucleotides and nucleic acids, also suffer from depurination. Deoxyribonucleosides and their derivatives are substantially more prone to depurination than their corresponding ribonucleoside counterparts. Loss of pyrimidine bases (Cytosine and Thymine) occurs by a similar mechanism, but at a substantially lower rate.|$|E
5000|$|The DNA nucleosides {{adenosine}} and guanosine {{consist of}} a purine base attached to a ribose sugar with a glycosidic bond. In the case of RNA nucleotides <b>deoxyadenosine</b> and deoxyguanosine, the purine bases are attached to a deoxyribose sugar with a glycosidic bond. The purine bases on DNA and RNA nucleotides are synthesized in a twelve-step reaction mechanism present in most single-celled organisms. Higher eukaryotes employ a similar reaction mechanism in ten reaction steps. Purine bases are synthesized by converting phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) to inosine monophosphate (IMP), {{which is the first}} key intermediate in purine base biosynthesis. [...] Further enzymatic modification of IMP produces the adenosine and guanosine bases of nucleotides.|$|E
50|$|For a long time, it was {{believed}} that kinetin was an artifact produced from the <b>deoxyadenosine</b> residues in DNA, which degrade on standing for long periods or when heated during the isolation procedure. Therefore, it was thought that kinetin does not occur naturally, but, since 1996, it has been shown by several researchers that kinetin exists naturally in the DNA of cells of almost all organisms tested so far, including human and various plants. The mechanism of production of kinetin in DNA is thought to be via the production of furfural — an oxidative damage product of deoxyribose sugar in DNA — and its quenching by the adenine base's converting it into N6-furfuryladenine, kinetin.|$|E
50|$|It is {{suggested}} that a CYP- or peroxidase-mediated activation of Sudan I {{or a combination of}} both mechanisms as an explanation for the organ specificity of this carcinogen for liver and urinary bladder in animals. It must be noted that the Sudan I metabolites formed by peroxidase are much less likely to be formed at physiological conditions, because in vivo there are many nucleophilic molecules present which scavenge the Sudan I reactive species. Hence, formation of adducts of Sudan I reactive species with nucleophilic species, such as DNA, tRNA, proteins, polynucleotides, and polydeoxynucleotides seems to be the preferred reaction under physiological conditions, with deoxyguanosine as the major target for Sudan-I DNA binding, followed by <b>deoxyadenosine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Purines and pyrimidines {{make up the}} {{two groups}} of {{nitrogenous}} bases, including {{the two groups of}} nucleotide bases. Two of the four deoxyribonucleotides (<b>deoxyadenosine</b> and deoxyguanosine) and two of the four ribonucleotides (adenosine, or AMP, and guanosine, or GMP), the respective building blocks of DNA and RNA, are purines. In order to form DNA and RNA, both purines and pyrimidines are needed by the cell in approximately equal quantities. Both purine and pyrimidine are self-inhibiting and activating. When purines are formed, they inhibit the enzymes required for more purine formation. This self-inhibition occurs as they also activate the enzymes needed for pyrimidine formation. Pyrimidine simultaneously self-inhibits and activates purine in similar manner. Because of this, there is nearly an equal amount of both substances in the cell at all times.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike other {{mechanisms}} of phase variation, epigenetic modifications do not alter DNA sequence {{and therefore it}} is the phenotype that is altered not the genotype. The integrity of the genome is intact and the change incurred by methylation alters the binding of transcription factors. The outcome is the regulation of transcription resulting in switches in gene expression. [...] An outer membrane protein Antigen 43 (Ag43) in E. coli is controlled by phase variation mediated by two proteins, DNA-methylating enzyme <b>deoxyadenosine</b> methyltransferase (Dam) and the oxidative stress regulator OxyR. Ag43, located on the cell surface, is encoded by the Agn43 gene (previously designated as flu) and is important for biofilms and infection. The expression of Agn43 {{is dependent on the}} binding of the regulator protein OxyR. When OxyR is bound to the regulatory region of Agn43, which overlaps with the promoter, it inhibits transcription. The ON phase of transcription is dependent upon Dam methylating the GATC sequences {{in the beginning of the}} Agn43 gene (which happens to overlap with the OxyR binding site). When the Dam methylates the GATC sites it inhibits the OxyR from binding, allowing transcription of Ag43.|$|E
