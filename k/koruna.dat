40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the role of}} foreign exchange interventions in the inflation-targeting regime, focusing on the Czech experience since 1998.

We also discuss consistency of the interventions with the inflation-targeting framework. All the Czech intervention episodes are judged {{to be consistent with}} the inflation targets and output developments, but for two episodes not fully consistent regarding the mix of monetary conditions.
