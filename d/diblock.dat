40|$|A {{method is}} {{developed}} to enable emulsion polymerization {{to be performed}} under RAFT control to give living character without the problems that often affect such systems: formation of an oily layer, loss of colloidal stability, or loss of molecular weight control. Trithiocarbonate RAFT agents are used to form short stabilizing blocks from a water-soluble monomer, from which <b>diblocks</b> can be created by the subsequent polymerization of a hydrophobic monomer. These <b>diblocks</b> are designed to self-assemble to form micelles. Polymerization is initially performed under conditions that avoid the presence of monomer droplets during the particle formation stage and until the hydrophobic ends of the <b>diblocks</b> have become sufficiently long {{to prevent them from}} desorbing from the newly formed particles. Polymerization is then continued at any desired feed rate and composition of monomer. The polymer forming in the reaction remains under RAFT control throughout the polymerization; molecular weight polydispersities are generally low. The number of RAFT-ended chains within a particle is much larger than the aggregation number at which the original micelles would have self-assembled, implying that {{in the early stages of}} the polymerization, there is aggregation of the micelles and/or migration of the <b>diblocks.</b> The latexes resulting from this approach are stabilized by anchored blocks of the hydrophilic monomer, e. g., acrylic acid, with no labile surfactant present. Sequential polymerization of two hydrophobic monomers gives completely novel core-shell particles where most chains extend from the core of the particles through the shell layer to the surface...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} self-consistent field theory (SCFT) study of spherical micelle {{formation}} in {{a blend of}} poly(styrene-butadiene) <b>diblocks</b> and homopolystyrene. The micelle core radii, corona thicknesses and critical micelle concentrations are calculated as functions of the polymer molecular weights and {{the composition of the}} <b>diblocks.</b> Our results are compared with an earlier scaling theory and with X-ray scattering data. The agreement between self-consistent field theory and experiment for the micelle structure is sometimes quantitative and is generally more successful than scaling theory. For copolymers with relatively light core blocks, SCFT predictions for the critical micelle concentration improve over those of scaling theories by an order of magnitude. In the case of heavier core blocks, SCFT predicts the critical micelle concentration less well due to inaccuracies in the modelling of the bulk chemical potential. Overall, we find that SCFT gives a very good description of spherical micelle formation and hence demonstrate that a mean-field, equilibrium approach is valid for these systems.

40|$|The {{synthesis}} of model block copolypeptides through living nucleophilic/basic polymerization of R-amino acid N-carboxyanhydrides (NCAs) {{has been a}} challenge for more than fifty years, most probably due to traces of impurities in the system. This problem has been overcome by using high vacuum techniques which ensure not only high purity of all reagents involved but also create and maintain all necessary conditions for the living polymerization of NCAs. By using the above initiating system, high vacuum technics and sequential addition of monomers we managed to synthesize well-defined linear <b>diblocks</b> of γ-benzyl-L-glutamete (BLG), ε-carbobenzyloxy-lysine (ZLL), ε-Boc-L-lysine (Boc-Lys), glycine (Gly), leucine (Leu), alanine (Ala) and tyrosine (Tyr) with composition defined by stoichiometry. Also triblock copolymers were synthesized succefully either by using diaminehexane as a difunctional initiator, or by coupling living <b>diblocks</b> with diisocyanatehexane as a linking agent. The morphology of PBLG-polyglycine block copolymers was studied by small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide angle scattering (WAXS). All <b>diblocks</b> exhibit microphase separation and steady secondary structure {{at the same time}} The livingness of the polypeptides under high vacuum conditions can be preserved indefinitely, thus making possible the use of linking chemistry for the {{synthesis of}} a wide variety of macromolecular architectures. The methodology presented in this work is a general one and, in contrast to other methods, can be extended to the synthesis of polypeptides with a wide variety of macromolecular architectures, such as multiblock, cyclic, super-H, and miktoarm stars. These novel architectures expected to lead to expanded opportunities in biomedical applications. Moreover by using dendrimers or other multifunctional initiators is possible to synthesize star and star blocks with different number of arms and in short period of time. In this point we synthesize ampiphilic four arm star blocks. Finally synthesis of ybridic linear <b>diblocks</b> of polystyrene and polyethylenoxide was achieved by using amine functionalized polymers. Model ybridic copolymers can be made only if the purity of the amine is good one at the level of anionic technics. The possible combinations of linear or star structures with natural amino-acids with L, D or L / D conformation and different protective groups, as well as combinations of ybridic copolymers with linear or more complicated macromolecular architecture are unlimited and it is certain that this subject will occupy our laboratory for a long time. ...|$|R

For the micelle core radii R, we find that SCFT reproduces the shape of the variation of R with different molecular parameters much more accurately compared to scaling theory, though, like scaling theory, it overestimates R by about 20 - 30 %. For the corona thickness L, the accuracy of our SCFT results is at least as good as that of scaling theory. For copolymers with lighter core blocks, SCFT predictions for the critical micelle concentration improve over those of scaling theories by an order of magnitude. In the case of heavier core blocks, however, SCFT predicts the critical micelle concentration less well due to inaccuracies in the modeling of the bulk chemical potential.

40|$|The {{development}} of stimuli-responsive polymers, especially thermo-responsive ones, {{has been a}} tremendous field {{of research in the}} last years. The solubility of such macromolecules can be reversibly triggered by small changes of temperature without additives. Poly(N-vinylcaprolactam) (PNVCL), which exhibits a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) around 36 °C and a low toxicity, is of particular interest especially for biomedical applications. For these reasons, the insertion of well-defined PNVCL segments in more complex architectures is highly desirable but it requires efficient synthetic tools. In this context, we have developed a cobalt-mediated radical polymerization (CMRP) for synthesizing novel well-defined NVCL-based copolymers. First, the LCST of PNVCL was tuned over a wide range of temperature by incorporation of specific amounts of N-vinylpyrrolidone (NVP) in the backbone. Then, CMRP of NVCL followed by statistical NVCL/NVP copolymerization led to <b>diblocks</b> having two discrete LCSTs. Finally, double.

40|$|The {{structure}} and {{dynamics of the}} poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) segregated nanophase in block copolymers with polystyrene (PS) has been analyzed in detail by combining wide- and small-angle X-ray diffraction, infrared absorption, differential scanning calorimetry, and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy.

It is found that in these highly segregated cylindrical and spherical regions in the copolymers PDMS presents a rather unexpected behavior as probed by X-ray diffraction, infrared absorption, differential scanning calorimetry, and dielectric relaxation spectroscopy. Structural techniques indicate poor packing of the PDMS segments, whereas calorimetric experiments evidence both strong suppression of PDMS crystallization and significant reduction of the glass transition temperature range. Connected with that, the dielectric relaxation probing the PDMS segmental dynamics is much more heterogeneous and markedly faster not only than that observed for PDMS in lamellar nanophases but more strikingly than that of PDMS melt. 2011 American Chemical Society.
