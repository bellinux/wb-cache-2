50|$|Ground heat {{exchangers}} (GHEs), {{which are also}} called geothermal {{heat exchangers}}, have emerged as a promising and globally accepted way of exploiting shallow geothermal energy, for example ground-coupled heat pumps, ground heat storage. A GHE is essentially a pipe (e.g., U-, W-, or helical-shaped) in a vertical borehole or a foundation pile of a building, in which a circulating heat-carrying fluid absorbs (or discharges) heat from (or to) the ground.GHEs can have various configurations. This article discusses two kinds of closed loop GHEs, i.e., borehole and foundation pile GHEs. The borehole type is the most common. It consists {{of one or two}} U-shaped pipes that are inserted into a vertical borehole and connected to a heat pump or a heating system to form a closed loop. A U-shaped channel usually comprises two small-diameter high-density polyethylene (HDPE) tubes thermally fused to form a U-shaped bend at the bottom. The space between the wall of the borehole and the U-shaped tubes is usually grouted completely with grouting material or, in some cases, partially filled with groundwater. The depth of the hole (generally from 30 m to 200 m) depends strongly on local geological conditions and available drilling equipment.In a foundation pile GHE (or <b>energy</b> <b>pile),</b> the heat transfer tubes are inside the steel frame of a foundation pile. There are various possible shapes. Foundation piles are usually much shallower than boreholes and have a greater radius. Since energy piles generally require less land area, this technology is evoking increasing interest in the ground-source heat pumps community.|$|E

This indicated that no losses in pile shaft capacity were observed after heating and cooling cycles. A variance in average vertical thermal strains was observed along the upper section of the pile shaft {{at the end of the}} heating periods.

Pile average circumferential strains were found to be relatively uniform at the end of the heating and cooling periods and did not change with depth.

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>piles</b> are an {{emerging}} alternative for {{the reduction of}} energy consumption to heat and cool buildings. The majority of the research to date focuses on thermodynamic properties or axial strain of piles. This paper concerns the effects of temperature fluctuation on the capacity of driven <b>energy</b> <b>piles</b> in clayey soils. Consolidation of clay (due to the dissipation of excess pore-water pressure in clay) surrounding piles affects {{the capacity of the}} pile (pile setup in clay). Reciprocally, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that heating and cooling periods will create or relax the excess pore-water pressure (EPWP) in clayey soils (due to the contraction and expansion of water) affecting the pile capacity. In the meantime, the thermal expansion and contraction of the pile also generates or relaxes the EPWP in the soil, which can be computed using the principle of cavity expansion theory. The resulting change in the EPWP due to the thermal cycle happens through day and night and is much faster than the drainage time required by the clay. This lack of time for dissipation of EPWP affects the effective stress and, hence, the capacity of the pile. Hence, there is a need for an analysis that couples: (i) consolidation of clay, (ii) thermal expansion/contraction of pile and, in turn, the resulting relaxed/generated EPWP in clay, and (iii) thermal expansion/contraction of soil and, in turn, the resulting generated/relaxed EPWP in clay computed through cavity expansion theory. Therefore, a numerical analysis model was developed to analyze the generation and dissipation of the EPWP resulting from all of these phenomena. This coupled analysis helps compute the variations of the generated EPWP and, in turn, its effect on the effective stress and, hence, pile capacity. The numerical model also supports the hypothesis that the heating effect can accelerate the pile setup in clay. This flexible model can be used to estimate the ultimate capacity of <b>energy</b> <b>piles,</b> or even evaluate the possibility of using heating through construction to expedite pile setup in clay...|$|R

The results of the numerical simulations, in qualitative agreement with the limited experimental observations from full—scale tests on <b>energy</b> <b>piles</b> currently available in the literature, show that significant (positive and negative) axial load changes can be experienced by both thermally active and non— active piles of the raft.

For the thermal properties of the soils and the raft geometries considered in this study, the peak in axial load variations are observed within about 30 days after the beginning of the thermal stage. This time span is well inside the normal operation times of GSHP systems, of the order of a few months.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Civil EngineeringDunja PericPiles {{have been}} used for many years in civil {{infrastructure}} as foundations for buildings, bridges, and retaining walls. <b>Energy</b> <b>piles</b> are thermo-active foundation systems that use geothermal energy for heating and cooling of buildings. Ground source heat is a very attractive, economical, efficient and sustainable alternative to current heating practices. Unlike the air temperature, the temperature below the Earth’s surface remains relatively constant throughout the year, somewhere between 10 oC to 15 oC below a depth of 6 m to 9 m (Kelly, 2011). This provides an opportunity for construction of thermo-active foundation systems with embedded geothermal loops. The main purpose of such thermo-active system is to transfer deep ground heat to a building through the fluid circulating within the geothermal loop. It is because these thermo-active foundation systems enable heat exchange between the deep ground and the building that is called the heat exchanger pile (HEP). The thermal energy supplied by a HEP can then supplement air-pump-based heating/cooling system. Although heat exchanger piles have been successfully implemented in Europe and Asia, their usage in U. S. remains uncommon. One reason for this might be currently limited understanding of the associated soil-structure interaction, thus unfavorably affecting the design procedures. To this end, a study was undertaken to investigate the predictive capabilities of computational models and {{to gain a better understanding}} of the load-transfer mechanisms of <b>energy</b> <b>piles.</b> Thus, coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical computational modeling of a single actual end bearing HEP was carried out for different loading scenarios including thermal and mechanical loads by using the finite element code ABAQUS/Standard 6. 13 - 2. The results of the analyses of the heat exchanger pile with two different types of layered soil profile are presented: isotropic and anisotropic. The computational model was validated and verified successfully against field test results for all considered loading scenarios. Additional analyses were performed to gain a deeper insight into the effects of soil layering and on the behavior of <b>energy</b> <b>piles.</b> It was found that changes in the soil stiffness affected primarily the head displacement and vertical stresses and strains in the pile...|$|R

Such foundations, often called <b>energy</b> <b>piles,</b> have the potential to make signific ant contributions towards meeting the heating and cooling demands of buildings, thus reducing the overall energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions during their lifespan. To ensure that the available energy from these systems is maximized, it is important to determine the thermal conductivity of the surrounding soils, a key design input parameter. In situ thermal response tests are commonly used to carry out this task for small diameter borehole heat exchangers. However, there has been debate over the applicability of these tests to <b>energy</b> <b>piles</b> due to their larger diameter and the consequent increased influence of the pile thermal properties on the test outcome. This paper examines the results of three thermal response tests carried out on piles of different diameters and thermal properties installed at the same site in Texas. Transient analysis of the test results, combined with comparisons to laboratory testing of soil samples from the site, is used to given an indication of the applicability of the thermal response test over different timescales for the different piles. It is concluded that the test is most suited to smaller diameter piles constructed with lower thermal diffusivity materials. Recommendations are given for the conduction of pile thermal response tests and interpretation of test data...|$|R
