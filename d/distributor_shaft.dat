25|$|The {{ignition}} coil's {{high voltage}} output {{is connected to the}} rotor that sits on top of the <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft.</b> Surrounding the rotor is the distributor cap. The arrangement sequentially directs the output of the secondary winding to the appropriate spark plugs. The high voltage from the coil's secondary (typically 20,000 to 50,000 volts) causes a spark to form across the gap of the spark plug that in turn ignites the compressed air-fuel mixture within the engine. It is the creation of this spark which consumes the energy that was stored in the ignition coil’s magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{ignition}} (EI) solves these problems. In {{the initial}} systems, points were still used but they handled only a low current {{which was used}} to control the high primary current through a solid state switching system. Soon, however, even these contact breaker points were replaced by an angular sensor of some kind - either optical, where a vaned rotor breaks a light beam, or more commonly using a Hall effect sensor, which responds to a rotating magnet mounted on the <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft.</b> The sensor output is shaped and processed by suitable circuitry, then used to trigger a switching device such as a thyristor, which switches a large current through the coil.|$|E
25|$|As {{the engine}} {{crankshaft}} turns, it also turns the <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> at half the speed. In a four-stroke engine, the crankshaft turns twice for the ignition cycle. A multi-lobed cam {{is attached to}} the distributor shaft; there is one lobe for each engine cylinder. A spring-loaded rubbing block follows the lobed portions of the cam contour and controls the opening and closing of points. During most of the cycle, the rubbing block keeps the points closed to allow a current to build in the ignition coil's primary winding. As a piston reaches the top of the engine's compression cycle, the cam's lobe is high enough to cause the breaker points to open. Opening the points causes the current through the primary coil to stop. Without the steady current through the primary, the magnetic field generated in the coil immediately collapses. This high rate of change of magnetic flux induces a high voltage in the coil's secondary windings that ultimately causes the spark plug's gap to arc and ignite the fuel.|$|E

Versions of the FE line {{designed}} for use in medium and heavy trucks and school buses from 1964 through 1978 were known as [...] "FT," [...] for 'Ford-Truck,' and differed primarily by having steel (instead of nodular iron) crankshafts, larger crank snouts, different <b>distributor</b> <b>shafts,</b> different water pumps and a greater use of iron for its parts.|$|R
50|$|The <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> has a cam that {{operates}} the contact breaker (also called points). Opening the points causes a high induction voltage in the system's ignition coil.|$|E
5000|$|A {{distributor}} {{consists of}} a rotating arm or [...] inside the distributor cap, {{on top of the}} <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft,</b> but insulated from it and the body of the vehicle (ground). The <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> is driven by a gear on the camshaft on most overhead valve engines, and attached directly to a camshaft on most overhead cam engines. (The <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> may also drive the oil pump.) The metal part of the rotor contacts the high voltage cable from the ignition coil via a spring-loaded carbon brush {{on the underside of the}} distributor cap. The metal part of the rotor arm passes close to (but does not touch) the output contacts which connect via high tension leads to the spark plug of each cylinder. As the rotor spins within the distributor, electric current is able to jump the small gaps created between the rotor arm and the contacts due to the high voltage created by the ignition coil.|$|E
50|$|Russ Snowberger was {{the first}} {{car out of the}} race, {{suffering}} a broken supercharger. Then, after starting in the outside of the front row, Cliff Bergere was out on lap 6 with a broken <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
50|$|Around the 1970s {{the primary}} breaker points were largely {{replaced}} with a Hall effect sensor or optical sensor. As this is a non-contacting device and the ignition coil is controlled by solid state electronics, {{a great amount of}} maintenance in point adjustment and replacement was eliminated. This also eliminates any problem with breaker follower or cam wear, and by eliminating a side load it extends <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> bearing life. The remaining secondary (high voltage) circuit stayed essentially the same, using an ignition coil and a rotary distributor.|$|E
50|$|The {{distributor}} also {{houses the}} centrifugal advance unit: {{a set of}} hinged weights attached to the <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft,</b> that cause the breaker points mounting plate to slightly rotate and advance the spark timing with higher engine revolutions per minute (rpm). In addition, the distributor has a vacuum advance unit that advances the timing even further {{as a function of}} the vacuum in the inlet manifold. Usually there is also a capacitor attached to the distributor. The capacitor is connected parallel to the breaker points, to suppress sparking to prevent excessive wear of the points.|$|E

50|$|Mark IV engines saw {{extensive}} {{application in}} Chevrolet and GMC medium duty trucks, {{as well as}} in Blue Bird Corporation's All American and TC/2000 transit buses (the latter up until 1995, using a 427 with purpose-built carburetor). In addition to the 427, a 366-cubic-inch (6.0 L) version was produced for the commercial market. Both the 366 and 427 commercial versions were built with a raised-deck, four-bolt main bearing cap cylinder to accommodate an extra oil control ring on the pistons. Unfortunately, the raised deck design complicated the use of the block in racing applications, as standard intake manifolds required spacers for proper fit. Distributors with adjustable collars that allowed adjustments to the length of the <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> also had to be used with 366 and 427 truck blocks.|$|E
50|$|The second {{method used}} to advance (or retard) the {{ignition}} timing is called vacuum timing advance. This method {{is almost always}} used in addition to mechanical timing advance. It generally increases fuel economy and driveability, particularly at lean mixtures. It also increases engine life through more complete combustion, leaving less unburned fuel to wash away the cylinder wall lubrication (piston ring wear), and less lubricating oil dilution (bearings, camshaft life, etc.). Vacuum advance works by using a manifold vacuum source to advance the timing at low to mid engine load conditions by rotating the position sensor (contact points, hall effect or optical sensor, reluctor stator, etc.) mounting plate in the distributor {{with respect to the}} <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft.</b> Vacuum advance is diminished at wide open throttle (WOT), causing the timing advance to return to the base advance in addition to the mechanical advance.|$|E
50|$|The rotor is {{attached}} {{to the top of the}} <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> which is driven by the engine's camshaft and thus synchronized to it. Synchronization to the camshaft is required as the rotor must turn at exactly half the speed of the main crankshaft in the 4-stroke cycle. Often, the rotor and distributor are attached directly to the end of the one of (or the only) camshaft, at the opposite end to the timing drive belt. This rotor is pressed against a carbon brush on the center terminal of the distributor cap which connects to the ignition coil. The rotor is constructed such that the center tab is electrically connected to its outer edge so the current coming in to the center post travels through the carbon point to the outer edge of the rotor. As the camshaft rotates, the rotor spins and its outer edge passes each of the internal plug terminals to fire each spark plug in sequence.|$|E
50|$|For {{simplicity}} and reliability, mechanical pumps are used, driven by mechanical geartrains from the crankshaft. Reducing pump speed is beneficial {{and so it}} is usual to drive the pump from the cam (if this is mounted in the cylinder block) or <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft,</b> which turns at half engine speed. Placing the oil pump low-down uses a near-vertical drive shaft, driven by helical skew gears from the camshaft. Some engines, such as the Fiat twin cam engine of 1964, began as OHV engines with an oil pump driven from a conventional camshaft in the cylinder block. When the twin overhead cam engine was developed, the previous oil pump arrangement was retained and the camshaft became a shortened stub shaft. Even when the distributor position was moved from the previous block-mount to being mounted on the cylinder head camshafts, the oil pump drive remained in the same position, the unused distributor position now covered by a blanking plate. Small engines, or scooters may have internal gear pumps mounted directly on their crankshaft.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: In {{conventional}} farming, {{the soil}} and crop are considered uniform in different locations of the farm and the fertilizers are applied according to the average of soil needs with an additional percentage for safety (Loghavi, 2003). Non-essential chemical fertilizers in the field have harmful effects and social, economic and environmental concerns will increase. Many fertilizers go into the surface waters and ground waters and cause poisoning and environmental pollution without being absorbed by the plants. In variable rate technology, the soil fertilizer needs a map of {{all parts of the}} farm which is prepared with the GIS system. This map is uploaded on the computer before variable rate fertilizer machine starts. The computer continually controls the fertilizing rate for each part of the farm using a fertilizing map and global positioning system. The {{purpose of this study is}} to construct and evaluate a map-based variable rate fertilizer system that can be installed on a common fertilizer in Iran to be used as a variable rate system. Materials and methods: In common variable rate fertilizers, the rotational speed change of the <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> is used to apply fertilizers. In this way, a DC motor is assembled on the main shaft of all distributors, which reduces the fertilizing accuracy. The reason for this is that there is no separation for units along the width of the fertilizer. Therefore, we used one DC motor for each distributor and another motor to rotate the agitator in the tank. System Set up: To design and select a suitable engine, the required torque for the rotation <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> was measured by a torque meter and the amount of 2. 1 Nm was acquired for that. With regard to the maximum rate of nitrogen fertilizer for land and tractor speed at the time of fertilizing, the order of 350 kg per hectare and 8 km per hour, the maximum <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> speed and power required to rotate <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> were calculated to be 55 rpm and 6. 9 watts, respectively. The selected motor was rated 27. 5 watts, 24 volts and 7. 5 amperes (Since there were no 6. 9 watts motors in the market, a more powerful motor was selected). According to the gear ratio and motor speed, the speed of the <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> was adjustable in the range of 0 to 65 rpm. To determine the speed and position with respect to the direction, a central encoder (E 50 S 8 - 600 - 6 -L- 5 model manufactured by Autonix Korea) was used on the ground wheel. The encoder had 600 pulses per revolution of the axis. Performance evaluation of the system: Performance evaluation of the system consists of two parts; static and moving tests. In static tests, the purpose was the determination of the fertilizer loss (in grams), due to changes in distributor speed as well as the accuracy of the electromechanical control system according to the command values sent to the device. Results of this part were used for the calibration of the device. In motion tests: In motion tests, the assessment of fertilizer loss was due to values set in a given situation and the accuracy of planted fertilizer in place (delay and acceleration) is reviewed. The delay is found by the determination of the distance that the fertilizer was placed after the desired location on the ground and the acceleration is found by the determination of the distance that the fertilizer is placed before the desired location on the ground. Results and discussion: The distributor flow rate on F 0 valve position was measured for different rotation speeds. The correlation (linear regression) between the planted fertilizer and rotation speed of <b>distributor</b> <b>shaft</b> (rpm) were 0. 99 for y= 71. 636 x+ 75. 182. So, it can be deduced that these two parameters have a good linear correlation. The results achieved from diagrams and regression model were used in the programming of the system control unit. Thus, by reading the distributors motor speed, the amount of fertilizer can be calculated and the amount of used fertilizer according to the need of the farm in each part is controlled.
