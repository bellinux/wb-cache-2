5|$|Cluster {{diffusion}} involves {{motion of}} atomic clusters ranging <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> dimers to islands containing hundreds of atoms. Motion {{of the cluster}} may occur via the displacement of individual atoms, sections of the cluster, or the entire cluster moving at once. All of these processes involve {{a change in the}} cluster’s center of mass.|$|E
5|$|First Nations and Inuit {{organizations}} ranged <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> band {{societies of}} a few people to multi-nation confederacies like the Iroquois. First Nations leaders {{from across the country}} formed the Assembly of First Nations, which began as the National Indian Brotherhood in 1968. The Métis and the Inuit are represented nationally by the Métis National Council and Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami respectively.|$|E

If the flowers are not exploited, sometimes the nectar is consumed (nectarivory) along with the pollen (palynivory). At least 24native species from 17plant families are targeted for nectar or pollen consumption.|$|E

5|$|Aerodrome is a {{collective}} term for any location from which flying operations take place, although more specific terminology {{can be used}} to characterise its purpose. The CAA strategic review of GA applies the term airport to locations which predominantly support large scale commercial operations, and airfield to locations which predominantly support GA operations. The General Aviation Small Aerodrome Research Study (GASAR) analysed 687 aerodromes in England which come under the scope of GA, classifying 374 into six types. These range <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> regional airports to the smallest farm strip, although 84 per cent of GA flights operate from 134 of the larger aerodromes in the first four categories.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are {{exclusively}} marine, {{and include}} sea anemones, stony corals, soft corals, sea pens, sea fans and sea pansies. Anthozoa {{is the largest}} taxon of cnidarians; over six thousand solitary and colonial species have been described. They range <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> small individuals {{less than half a}} centimetre across to large colonies a metre or more in diameter. They include species {{with a wide range of}} colours and forms that build and enhance reef systems. Although reefs and shallow water environments exhibit a great array of species, there are in fact more species of coral living in deep water than in shallow, and many taxa have shifted during their evolutionary history from shallow to deep water and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|As a defence {{against the}} cold, {{a colony of}} emperor {{penguins}} forms a compact huddle (also known as the turtle formation) ranging <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> ten to several hundred birds, with each bird leaning forward on a neighbour. As the wind chill is the least severe {{in the center of}} the colony, all the juveniles are usually huddled there. Those on the outside upwind tend to shuffle slowly around the edge of the formation and add themselves to its leeward edge, producing a slow churning action, and giving each bird a turn on the inside and on the outside.|$|E

5|$|Atrophic acne scars {{have lost}} {{collagen}} from the healing response {{and are the}} most common type of acne scar (account for approximately 75% of all acne scars). They may be further classified as ice-pick scars, boxcar scars, and rolling scars. Ice-pick scars are narrow (less than 2mm across), deep scars that extend into the dermis. Boxcar scars are round or ovoid indented scars with sharp borders and vary <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> 1.5–4mm across. Rolling scars are wider than icepick and boxcar scars (4–5mm across) and have a wave-like pattern of depth in the skin.|$|E
5|$|Castles, in {{the sense}} of a {{fortified}} residence of a lord or noble, arrived in Scotland as part of David I's encouragement of Norman and French nobles to settle with feudal tenures, particularly in the south and east, and were a way of controlling the contested lowlands. These were primarily wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, of a raised mount or motte, surmounted by a wooden tower and a larger adjacent enclosure or bailey, both usually surrounded by a fosse (a ditch) and palisade, and connected by a wooden bridge. They varied <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> the very large such as the Bass of Inverurie, to more modest designs like Balmaclellan.|$|E
5|$|Collegiate teams {{participating}} in the IARC have come primarily from the United States and the Peoples Republic of China, but also from Germany, England, Switzerland, Spain, Canada, Chile, Qatar, Iran, and India. Teams range <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> several students, up to twenty or more. Both undergraduate and graduate students populate the teams, but some teams have been composed entirely of undergraduates or postgraduates. Industry is not permitted to enter, but it may assist the student teams with funding and equipment.|$|E

5|$|During its flyby of Amalthea, the Galileo orbiter's star scanner {{detected}} nine flashes {{that appear}} to be small moonlets near the orbit of Amalthea. Because they were sighted only from one location, their true distances could not be measured. These moonlets may be anywhere <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> gravel to stadium-sized. Their origins are unknown, but they may be gravitationally captured into current orbit or they may be ejecta from meteor impacts on Amalthea. On the next and final orbit (just an hour before destruction), Galileo detected one more such moonlet. However, this time Amalthea {{was on the other side}} of the planet, so it is probable that the particles form a ring around the planet near Amalthea's orbit.|$|E
5|$|Early {{members of}} the ceratopsian group, such as Psittacosaurus, were small bipedal animals. Later members, {{including}} ceratopsids like Centrosaurus and Triceratops, became very large quadrupeds and developed elaborate facial horns and frills extending over the neck. While these frills might have served to protect the vulnerable neck from predators, they {{may also have been}} used for display, thermoregulation, the attachment of large neck and chewing muscles or some combination of the above. Ceratopsians ranged <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> 1meter (3ft) and 23kilograms (50lb) to over 9meters (30ft) and 9,100kg (20,100lb).|$|E
5|$|Hunting for ivory is {{responsible}} for significant reductions in elephant populations in several parts of Africa. Between 1979 and 1989, the African elephant population decreased <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> 1.3million to 600,000. Ivory became a billion-dollar market, with about 80% of the supply taken from illegally killed elephants. , {{according to a report}} by the Wildlife Conservation Society, about 96 African elephants are killed for their tusks every day.|$|E
50|$|Cascade Yachts was a {{pioneering}} U.S.-based builder of fiberglass monohull sloop-rigged sailboats ranging <b>in</b> <b>sizes</b> <b>from</b> 23 to 42 ft in length.

5|$|In 1938, the Montreal Maroons {{attempted}} {{to move to}} St. Louis. They were denied by the NHL due to the high travel costs that plagued the Eagles. The NHL returned to St. Louis in 1967, when the league doubled <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> the Original Six. The new team was named the Blues and they joined the Minnesota North Stars, Los Angeles Kings, Oakland Seals, Philadelphia Flyers, and Pittsburgh Penguins {{as part of the}} new expansion.|$|E
5|$|In general, seabirds live longer, breed {{later and}} have fewer young than other birds do, but they invest {{a great deal}} of time in their young. Most species nest in colonies, which can vary <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> a few dozen birds to millions. Many species are famous for {{undertaking}} long annual migrations, crossing the equator or circumnavigating the Earth in some cases. They feed both at the ocean's surface and below it, and even feed on each other. Seabirds can be highly pelagic, coastal, or in some cases spend a part of the year away from the sea entirely.|$|E
5|$|Individual feeding territories vary <b>in</b> <b>size</b> <b>from</b> , {{with the}} general {{concentration}} of coyotes in a given area depending on food abundance, adequate denning sites, and competition with conspecifics and other predators. The coyote generally does not defend its territory outside of the denning season, and is much less aggressive towards intruders than the wolf is, typically chasing and sparring with them, but rarely killing them. Conflicts between coyotes can arise during times of food shortage.|$|E
