5|$|The {{presence}} of pycnofibers (and {{the demands of}} flight) imply that pterosaurs were <b>endothermic</b> (warm-blooded). The absence of pycnofibers on pterosaur wings suggests that the coat {{did not have an}} aerodynamic function, lending support to the idea that pycnofibers evolved to aid pterosaur thermoregulation, as is common in warm-blooded animals, insulation being necessary to conserve the heat created by an <b>endothermic</b> metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Nearly all mammals are <b>endothermic</b> ("warm-blooded"). Most mammals {{also have}} hair {{to help keep}} them warm. Like birds, mammals can forage or hunt in weather and climates too cold for ectothermic ("cold-blooded") {{reptiles}} and insects. Endothermy requires plenty of food energy, so mammals eat more food per unit of body weight than most reptiles. Small insectivorous mammals eat prodigious amounts for their size. A rare exception, the naked mole-rat produces little metabolic heat, so it is considered an operational poikilotherm. Birds are also <b>endothermic,</b> so endothermy {{is not unique to}} mammals.|$|E
5|$|The growing {{consensus}} about the endothermy of dinosaurs (see dinosaur physiology) helps {{to understand their}} full extinction in contrast with their close relatives, the crocodilians. Ectothermic ("cold-blooded") crocodiles have very limited needs for food (they can survive several months without eating) while <b>endothermic</b> ("warm-blooded") animals of similar size need much more food to sustain their faster metabolism. Thus, under the circumstances of food chain disruption previously mentioned, non-avian dinosaurs died, while some crocodiles survived. In this context, the survival of other <b>endothermic</b> animals, such as some birds and mammals, could be due, among other reasons, to their smaller needs for food, related to their small size at the extinction epoch.|$|E
5|$|Examining the oxygen-isotope ratio {{from the}} bones from {{different}} parts of an extinct animal's body should indicate which thermoregulation mode an animal used during its lifetime. An <b>endothermic</b> (warm-blooded) animal should maintain a very similar body temperature throughout its entire body (which is called homeothermy) and therefore there should be little variation in the oxygen-isotope ratio when measured in different bones. Alternatively, the oxygen-isotope ratio differs considerably when measured throughout the body of an organism with an ectothermic (cold-blooded) physiology. Oxygen-isotope ratios calculated for Hypacrosaurus suggesting that the ratios varied little, indicating that Hypacrosaurus was a homeotherm, and likely was <b>endothermic.</b> This is in contrast to the Ruben et al. (1996) finding that Hypacrosaurus was not warm-blooded, which was based on the absence of nasal turbinates (see Crest functions subsection, above).|$|E
5|$|In massive stars, heavier {{elements}} {{can also}} be burned in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process. The final stage in the stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon-burning process that results {{in the production of}} the stable isotope iron-56, an <b>endothermic</b> process that consumes energy, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|Most studies {{consider}} dinosaurs as <b>endothermic</b> (warm-blooded) animals, with {{an elevated}} metabolism {{comparable to that}} of today's mammals and birds. In a 2009 study, Herman Pontzer and colleagues calculated the aerobic endurance of various dinosaurs. Even at moderate running speeds, Heterodontosaurus would have exceeded the maximum aerobic capabilities possible for an ectotherm (cold-blooded) animal, indicating endothermy in this genus.|$|E
5|$|The {{chlorine}} oxides are well-studied {{in spite of}} their instability (all of them are <b>endothermic</b> compounds). They are important because they are produced when chlorofluorocarbons undergo photolysis in the upper atmosphere and cause the destruction of the ozone layer. None of them can be made from directly reacting the elements.|$|E
5|$|Tianyulong from China {{appears to}} {{preserve}} filamentous integument {{which has been}} interpreted to be {{a variant of the}} proto-feathers found in some theropods. These filaments include a crest along its tail. The presence of this filamentous integument has been used to suggest that both ornithischians and saurischians were <b>endothermic.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{pinnipeds}} are carnivorous and predatory. As a whole, {{they mostly}} feed on fish and cephalopods, followed by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and <b>endothermic</b> ("warm-blooded") prey like sea birds. While most species are generalist and opportunistic feeders, {{a few are}} specialists. Examples include the crabeater seal, which primarily eats krill, the ringed seal, which eats mainly crustaceans, the Ross seal and southern elephant seal, which specialize on squid, and the bearded seal and walrus, which feed on clams and other bottom-dwelling invertebrates. Pinnipeds may hunt solitarily or cooperatively. The former behavior is typical when hunting non-schooling fish, slow-moving or immobile invertebrates or <b>endothermic</b> prey. Solitary foraging species usually exploit coastal waters, bays and rivers. An exception to this is the northern elephant seal, which feeds on fish at great depths in the open ocean. In addition, walruses feed solitarily but are often near other walruses in small or large groups that may surface and dive in unison. When large schools of fish or squid are available, pinnipeds such as certain otariids hunt cooperatively in large groups, locating and herding their prey. Some species, such as California and South American sea lions, may forage with cetaceans and sea birds.|$|E
5|$|At room temperature, it is a {{colourless}} gas, {{like all}} of the hydrogen halides except hydrogen fluoride, since hydrogen cannot form strong hydrogen bonds to the large and only mildly electronegative iodine atom. It melts at −51.0°C and boils at −35.1°C. It is an <b>endothermic</b> compound that can exothermically dissociate at room temperature, although the process is very slow unless a catalyst is present: the reaction between hydrogen and iodine at room temperature to give hydrogen iodide does not proceed to completion. The H–I bond dissociation energy is likewise {{the smallest of the}} hydrogen halides, at 295kJ/mol.|$|E
5|$|Oxygen isotope ratios in fossilized bone are {{sometimes}} {{used to determine}} the temperature at which the bone was deposited, as the ratio between certain isotopes correlates with temperature. In one specimen, the isotope ratios in bones from different parts of the body indicated a temperature difference of no more than 4 to 5°C (7 to 9°F) between the vertebrae of the torso and the tibia of the lower leg. This small temperature range between the body core and the extremities was claimed by paleontologist Reese Barrick and geochemist William Showers to indicate that Tyrannosaurus rex maintained a constant internal body temperature (homeothermy) and that it enjoyed a metabolism somewhere between ectothermic reptiles and <b>endothermic</b> mammals. Other scientists have pointed out that the ratio of oxygen isotopes in the fossils today does not necessarily represent the same ratio in the distant past, and may have been altered during or after fossilization (diagenesis). Barrick and Showers have defended their conclusions in subsequent papers, finding similar results in another theropod dinosaur from a different continent and tens of millions of years earlier in time (Giganotosaurus). Ornithischian dinosaurs also showed evidence of homeothermy, while varanid lizards from the same formation did not. Even if Tyrannosaurus rex does exhibit evidence of homeothermy, it {{does not necessarily mean that}} it was <b>endothermic.</b> Such thermoregulation may also be explained by gigantothermy, as in some living sea turtles.|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds mostly feed on {{fish and}} cephalopods, {{followed}} by crustaceans and bivalves, and then zooplankton and warm-blooded prey (like sea birds).

5|$|The Sun is a Population I, or heavy-element-rich, star. The {{formation}} of the Sun may have been triggered by shockwaves from one or more nearby supernovae. This is suggested by a high abundance of heavy elements in the Solar System, such as gold and uranium, relative to the abundances of these elements in so-called Population II, heavy-element-poor, stars. The heavy elements could most plausibly have been produced by <b>endothermic</b> nuclear reactions during a supernova, or by transmutation through neutron absorption within a massive second-generation star.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{tetrapods}} {{but though}} their hind limbs {{are used for}} walking or hopping, their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight. Birds are <b>endothermic,</b> have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles. The long bones are thin, hollow and very light. Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones. The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused. There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak. The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls. They face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks.|$|E
5|$|In 1986, J.Scott Turner and C.Richard Tracy {{proposed}} that {{the evolution of a}} sail in Dimetrodon was related to the evolution of warm-bloodedness in mammal ancestors. They thought that the sail of Dimetrodon enabled it to be homeothermic, maintaining a constant, albeit low, body temperature. Mammals are also homeothermic, although they differ from Dimetrodon in being <b>endothermic,</b> controlling their body temperature internally through heightened metabolism. Turner and Tracy noted that early therapsids, a more advanced group of synapsids closely related to mammals, had long limbs which can release heat {{in a manner similar to}} that of the sail of Dimetrodon. The homeothermy that developed in animals like Dimetrodon may have carried over to therapsids through a modification of body shape, which would eventually develop into the warm-bloodedness of mammals.|$|E
5|$|Many other binary {{nitrogen}} hydrides are known, but {{the most}} important are hydrazine (N2H4) and hydrogen azide (HN3). Although it is not a nitrogen hydride, hydroxylamine (NH2OH) is similar in properties and structure to ammonia and hydrazine as well. Hydrazine is a fuming, colourless liquid that smells similarly to ammonia. Its physical properties are very similar to those of water (melting point 2.0°C, boiling point 113.5°C, density 1.00g·cm−3). Despite it being an <b>endothermic</b> compound, it is kinetically stable. It burns quickly and completely in air very exothermically to give nitrogen and water vapour. It is a very useful and versatile reducing agent and is a weaker base than ammonia. It is also commonly used as a rocket fuel.|$|E
5|$|The {{fusion of}} two nuclei that create larger nuclei with lower atomic numbers than iron and nickel—a total nucleon number of about 60—is usually an {{exothermic}} process that releases {{more energy than}} is required to bring them together. It is this energy-releasing process that makes nuclear fusion in stars a self-sustaining reaction. For heavier nuclei, the binding energy per nucleon in the nucleus begins to decrease. That means fusion processes producing nuclei that have atomic numbers higher than about 26, and atomic masses higher than about 60, is an <b>endothermic</b> process. These more massive nuclei can not undergo an energy-producing fusion reaction that can sustain the hydrostatic equilibrium of a star.|$|E
5|$|The ribs were {{connected}} to the dorsal (trunk) vertebrae with two joints, acting together as a simple hinge joint, which has allowed researchers to reconstruct the inhaled and exhaled positions of the ribcage. The difference in volume between these two positions defines the air exchange volume (the amount of air moved with each breath), determined to be approximately 20L for a P.engelhardti individual estimated to have weighed690kg, or 29mL/kg bodyweight. This is a typical value for birds, but not for mammals, and indicates that Plateosaurus probably had an avian-style flow-through lung, although indicators for postcranial pneumaticity (air sacs of the lung invading the bones to reduce weight) {{can be found on}} the bones of only a few individuals, and were only recognized in 2010. Combined with evidence from bone histology this indicates that Plateosaurus was <b>endothermic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} hydrogen (1312.0 kJ/mol) {{is much higher}} than that of the alkali metals. As only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom, hydrogen often behaves like a halogen, forming the negative hydride ion, and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis. (The alkali metals can also form negative ions, known as alkalides, but these are little more than laboratory curiosities, being unstable.) An argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is <b>endothermic,</b> unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens. The radius of the H− anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens: indeed, H− is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons. It was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic properties; while this has been shown to not be the case, under extremely high pressures, such as those found at the cores of Jupiter and Saturn, hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali metal; in this phase, it is known as metallic hydrogen. The electrical resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at 3000 K is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at 2000 K at the respective pressures when they undergo a nonmetal-to-metal transition.|$|E
25|$|The second {{reaction}} is exothermic {{but the overall}} process is <b>endothermic.</b>|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} by Roger Seymour in 2013 added more {{support to the}} idea that dinosaurs were <b>endothermic.</b> After studying saltwater crocodiles, Seymour found that even if their large sizes could provide stable and high body temperatures, the crocodiles' ectothermic metabolisms provided less endurance and only 14% of the muscle power of a similar sized mammal. Seymour reasoned that dinosaurs would have needed to be <b>endothermic</b> since they would have needed powerful muscles and endurance to compete with and dominate mammals throughout the Mesozoic era.|$|E
25|$|This {{interpretation}} ignores extremely exothermic and <b>endothermic</b> reactions {{which are}} relatively unusual and relates the transition {{state to the}} intermediates which are usually the most unstable.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} to form {{carbon dioxide and}} molybdenum is <b>endothermic</b> at low temperatures, becoming less so with increasing temperature. ΔH° is zero at , and the reaction becomes exothermic above that temperature.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{determined}} by teeth records that several sea-dwelling reptiles, including plesiosauroids, had a warm-blooded metabolism {{similar to that of}} mammals. They could generate <b>endothermic</b> heat to survive in colder habitats.|$|E
25|$|High-energy {{neutrons}} {{can also}} produce tritium from lithium-7 in an <b>endothermic</b> (a net heat consuming reaction) reaction, consuming 2.466MeV. This was discovered when the 1954 Castle Bravo nuclear test produced an unexpectedly high yield.|$|E
25|$|In the {{canonical}} ensemble, {{amount of substance}} (N), volume (V) and temperature (T) are conserved. It is also sometimes called constant temperature molecular dynamics (CTMD). In NVT, the energy of <b>endothermic</b> and exothermic processes is exchanged with a thermostat.|$|E
25|$|The {{parts are}} first cleaned, usually with a vapor {{degreasing}} process, and then nitrocarburized around , with a process time {{that ranges from}} one to four hours. The actual gas mixtures are proprietary, but they usually contain ammonia and an <b>endothermic</b> gas.|$|E
25|$|The sulfur and iodine {{compounds}} are {{recovered and}} reused, hence {{the consideration of}} the process as a cycle. This process is <b>endothermic</b> and must occur at high temperatures, so {{energy in the form}} of heat has to be supplied.|$|E
25|$|Before the Castle Bravo nuclear test, it {{was thought}} that only the less common lithium-6 isotope would breed tritium when struck with fast neutrons. The test showed that the more {{plentiful}} lithium-7 also does so, albeit by an <b>endothermic</b> reaction.|$|E
25|$|Sodium {{carbonate}} is {{also used}} {{in the production of}} sherbet powder. The cooling and fizzing sensation results from the <b>endothermic</b> reaction between sodium carbonate and a weak acid, commonly citric acid, releasing carbon dioxide gas, which occurs when the sherbet is moistened by saliva.|$|E
25|$|Barrick and Showers {{concluded}} that both dinosaurs were <b>endothermic</b> but at lower metabolic levels than modern mammals, and that inertial homeothermy {{was an important}} part of their temperature regulation as adults. Their similar analysis of some Late Cretaceous ornithischians in 1996 {{concluded that}} these animals showed a similar pattern.|$|E
25|$|From a {{thermodynamic}} perspective, ·NO is unstable {{with respect}} to O2 and N2, although this conversion is very slow at ambient temperatures {{in the absence of}} a catalyst. Because the heat of formation of ·NO is <b>endothermic,</b> its synthesis from molecular nitrogen and oxygen requires elevated temperatures above 1000°C.|$|E
25|$|A {{reaction}} {{is said to}} be exergonic if the final state is lower on the energy scale than the initial state; in the case of endergonic reactions the situation is the reverse. A {{reaction is}} said to be exothermic if the reaction releases heat to the surroundings; in the case of <b>endothermic</b> reactions, the reaction absorbs heat from the surroundings.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of concrete produces water vapor and carbon dioxide, which may further react with the metals in the melt, oxidizing the metals, {{and reducing the}} gases to hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The {{decomposition of}} the concrete and volatilization of its alkali components is an <b>endothermic</b> process. Aerosols released during this phase are primarily based on concrete-originating silicon compounds; otherwise volatile elements, for example, caesium, can be bound in nonvolatile insoluble silicates.|$|E
25|$|On a {{laboratory}} scale, sulfuric acid can be diluted by pouring concentrated acid onto crushed ice made from de-ionized water. The ice melts in an <b>endothermic</b> process while dissolving the acid. The {{amount of heat}} needed to melt the ice in this process {{is greater than the}} amount of heat evolved by dissolving the acid so the solution remains cold. After all the ice has melted, further dilution can take place using water.|$|E
25|$|The basic {{principle}} underlying {{this technique is}} that when the sample undergoes a physical transformation such as phase transitions, more or less heat will need to flow to it than the reference to maintain both at the same temperature. Whether less or more heat must flow to the sample depends on whether the process is exothermic or <b>endothermic.</b> For example, as a solid sample melts to a liquid, it will require more heat flowing to the sample to increase its temperature {{at the same rate as}} the reference. This is due to the absorption of heat by the sample as it undergoes the <b>endothermic</b> phase transition from solid to liquid. Likewise, as the sample undergoes exothermic processes (such as crystallization) less heat is required to raise the sample temperature. By observing the difference in heat flow between the sample and reference, differential scanning calorimeters are able to measure the amount of heat absorbed or released during such transitions. DSC may also be used to observe more subtle physical changes, such as glass transitions. It is widely used in industrial settings as a quality control instrument due to its applicability in evaluating sample purity and for studying polymer curing.|$|E
