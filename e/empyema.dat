50|$|The Eloessar flap is a {{surgical}} procedure developed by Dr. Leo Eloesser in 1935 at the San Francisco General Hospital. It was {{originally intended to}} aide with drainage of tuberculous <b>empyemas,</b> since at the time there were no effective medications to treat tuberculosis. The procedure was used extensively until the development of effective chemotherapy for tuberculosis in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It is still used occasionally for chronic <b>empyemas.</b>|$|R
25|$|Abscesses {{should be}} {{differentiated}} from <b>empyemas,</b> which are accumulations of pus in a preexisting {{rather than a}} newly formed anatomical cavity.|$|R
50|$|The Eloesser flap {{is still}} {{utilized}} {{for patients with}} chronic <b>empyemas</b> who have not improved despite being treated with antibiotics and first line surgical procedures to remove pus and re-expand the lung such as decortication or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. Often they {{are thought to be}} too ill for more definitive procedures such as a major thoracotomy or muscle flap transposition. In a recent case series, the most common reasons to need an Eloessar flap were parapneumonic effusions and postresection <b>empyemas,</b> with only 9% done for tuberculosis.|$|R
25|$|Vancomycin may be {{substituted}} for nafcillin if significant concern exists for infection by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae.

25|$|Initial {{signs of}} FVR include coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, and {{sometimes}} fever (up to 106) {{and loss of}} appetite.

25|$|Pleural {{effusion}} and empyema: Microorganisms {{from the}} lung may trigger fluid {{collection in the}} pleural cavity. If the microorganisms are in the fluid, the collection is an <b>empyema.</b> If pleural fluid is present, it should be collected with a needle and examined. Depending on the results, complete drainage of the fluid with a chest tube may be necessary. If the fluid is not drained, bacteria may continue to proliferate because antibiotics do not penetrate the pleural cavity well.|$|E
50|$|Appropriate {{management}} includes chest tube drainage (tube thoracostomy). Treatment of <b>empyemas</b> includes antibiotics, complete pleural fluid drainage, and reexpansion of the lung.Other treatments {{include the}} use of decortication.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Parapneumonic effusions {{account for}} about one third of all pleural effusions. Approximately 40 % of {{patients}} with pneumonia develop a concomitant effusion, which is {{associated with an increased}} morbidity and mortality. In order to select the most appropriate therapy for the individual patient, the effusion should be categorized as being in the exudative, fibropurulent, or organi-zational stage, and all necessary information should be compiled to decide whether the effusion is likely to take an uncomplicated or a complicated course. There is a considerable variation in the aggressiveness and course of parapneumonic effu-sions, and, therefore, the spectrum of the appropriate therapy may vary from a conservative approach in uncomplicated effusions to aggressive surgical interven-tion in advanced multiloculated <b>empyemas.</b> This review discusses current diagnostic and therapeutic options and offers guide-lines for treating the various stages of parapneumonic effusions and <b>empyemas...</b>|$|R
25|$|Fluid {{in space}} between the lung and the chest wall is termed a pleural effusion. There needs {{to be at least}} 75ml of pleural fluid in order to blunt the costophrenic angle on the lateral chest radiograph, and 200ml on the posteroanterior chest radiograph. On a lateral decubitus, amounts as small as 50ml of fluid are possible. Pleural effusions {{typically}} have a meniscus visible on an erect chest radiograph, but loculated effusions (as occur with an <b>empyema)</b> may have a lenticular shape (the fluid making an obtuse angle with the chest wall).|$|E
25|$|During a {{performance}} of L'elisir d'amore by Donizetti at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on December 11, 1920, he suffered a throat haemorrhage and the performance was canceled {{at the end of}} Act 1. Following this incident, a clearly unwell Caruso gave only three more performances at the Met, the final one being as Eléazar in Halévy's La Juive, on 24 December 1920. By Christmas Day, the pain in his side was so excruciating that he was screaming. Dorothy summoned the hotel physician, who gave Caruso some morphine and codeine and called in another doctor, Evan M. Evans. Evans brought in three other doctors and Caruso finally received a correct diagnosis: purulent pleurisy and <b>empyema.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hippocrates {{began to}} {{categorize}} illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic, and use terms such as, [...] "exacerbation, relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence." [...] Another of Hippocrates' major contributions {{may be found}} in his descriptions of the symptomatology, physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of thoracic <b>empyema,</b> i.e. suppuration of the lining of the chest cavity. His teachings remain relevant to present-day students of pulmonary medicine and surgery. Hippocrates was the first documented chest surgeon and his findings and techniques, while crude, {{such as the use of}} lead pipes to drain chest wall abscess, are still valid.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Intrapleural {{administration}} of streptokinase {{has been shown}} in a few small series to be effective treatment for complicated parapneumonic effusions and pleural <b>empyemas,</b> but techniques of instillation of streptokinase differ. The role of streptokinase in promoting drainage was investigated prospectively in a larger series of patients with complicated parapneumonic effusions and pleural <b>empyemas.</b> METHODS [...] Twenty consecutive patients with parapneumonic effusions, 15 with complicated parapneumonic effusions and five with pleural <b>empyemas,</b> drawn from 160 patients presenting with pleural effusions were studied. The age of the patients ranged from 15 to 92 years. Initial thoracocentesis showed mean (SD) values of pH 7. 1 (0. 15), glucose 45. 9 (17. 5) mg/dl, white blood cell count 12, 000 (6627) /mm 3. Streptokinase was administered intrapleurally in a single daily dose of 250, 000 units in 100 ml normal saline via the chest tube once the drainage was < 100 ml/ 24 hours. Patients were treated for 3 - 10 (mean 6) days. RESULTS [...] Following {{administration of}} streptokinase a clinical and radiological improvement was noted in all but one patient who died on the fourth day of hospitalisation due to widespread adenocarcinoma. Another patient with clinical but minimal radiological improvement underwent thoracotomy, but a clear pleural space with only fibrotic changes was found. The mean (SD) volume of fluid drained 24 hours before streptokinase was 42. 5 (39) ml, which increased in the first 24 hours after streptokinase to 334 (130) ml. Radiological evaluation showed an excellent improvement in 14 of the 20 patients, a moderate improvement in three, and minimal improvement in the remaining three patients. One patient developed a high fever as an adverse reaction to streptokinase. All 19 patients who completed the treatment were well at follow up 6 - 30 months (mean 15 months) later. CONCLUSIONS [...] Intrapleural instillation of streptokinase is an effective and safe mode of treatment for complicated parapneumonic effusions and pleural <b>empyemas</b> and alleviates the need for thoracotomy...|$|R
40|$|P>Background The {{imbalance}} between oxidants and antioxidants {{is referred}} to as oxidative stress and has been associated with various respiratory disorders. The aim of this study was the assessment of 8 -isoprostane (8 -iso-PGF(2 alpha)) and Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu/Zn SOD) in exudative pleural effusions in order to examine the diagnostic accuracy of these markers in the differentiation between complicated and uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions. Methods The study included 214 consecutive patients with pleural effusions [68 parapneumonic (31 uncomplicated parapneumonic, 20 complicated parapneumonic, 17 <b>empyemas),</b> 24 tuberculous, 88 malignant and 34 transudates]. 8 -Isoprostane and Cu/Zn SOD were determined by ELISA in pleural fluid and serum. Results Parapneumonic effusions were characterized by higher pleural fluid 8 -isoprostane levels compared to transudative, malignant and tuberculous effusions. Pleural fluid Cu/Zn SOD levels were lower in transudates, while serum levels were higher in transudative compared to all exudative pleural effusions. Both pleural fluid 8 -isoprostane and Cu/Zn SOD were higher in complicated parapneumonic effusions and <b>empyemas</b> compared to uncomplicated parapneumonic effusions. Pleural fluid 8 -isoprostane was the most accurate test to differentiate between complicated and uncomplicated parapneumonic pleural effusions with a sensitivity of 100 % and a specificity of 58 center dot 1 % at a cut-off point of 35 center dot 1 (AUC = 0 center dot 848). Conclusions Pleural fluid 8 -isoprostane and Cu/Zn SOD may provide useful information for the differentiation between uncomplicated and complicated parapneumonic effusions and <b>empyemas...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background: Many {{patients}} with pneumonia develop pleural effusions. Pleural fluid vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels {{are known to}} be elevated in complicated parapneumonic effusion and seem {{to play a major role}} in the fibrotic process in the pleura. Objectives: To test whether VEGF levels in pleural effusions of infectious origin correlate with the residual pleural thickening. Methods: VEGF levels were measured in the pleural fluid of 45 {{patients with}} pleural effusion of infectious origin. Patients were reassessed 3 months after hospital discharge and residual pleural thickening (RPT) was recorded using a simple chest radiograph. Results: Pleural fluid VEGF was higher in <b>empyemas</b> compared to simple parapneumonic and complicated parapneumonic effusions. RPT was higher in patients with <b>empyemas</b> compared to simple parapneumonic effusions. Patients with RPT > 2 mm had higher pleural fluid LDH and pleural fluid to serum LDH ratio, lower glucose and pH and higher VEGF levels. However, patients with RPT >= 10 mm differed only in pleural fluid VEGF levels. Pleural fluid VEGF levels correlated to RPT and to pleural fluid pH. VEGF presented moderate performance for the prediction of RPT 3 months after hospital discharge. Its performance was comparable to that of pleural fluid glucose and pH for the development of a radiologically significant RPT > 2 mm, whereas it was the only statistically significant predictor of a clinically significant RPT >= 10 mm. Conclusion: VEGF levels are elevated in complicated parapneumonic effusions and <b>empyemas</b> compared to simple parapneumonic effusions and are a significant predictor for the development of clinically significant RPT.

2500|$|Measuring LDH in fluid {{aspirated}} from a {{pleural effusion}} (or pericardial effusion) {{can help in}} the distinction between exudates (actively secreted fluid, e.g. due to inflammation) or transudates (passively secreted fluid, due to a high hydrostatic pressure or a low oncotic pressure). The usual criterion (included in Light's criteria) is that a ratio of fluid LDH versus upper limit of normal serum LDH of more than 0.6 or [...] indicates an exudate, while a ratio of less indicates a transudate. Different laboratories have different values for the upper limit of serum LDH, but examples include 200 and 300 IU/L. In <b>empyema,</b> the LDH levels, in general, will exceed 1000 IU/L.|$|E
5000|$|An <b>empyema</b> (from Greek ἐμπύημα, [...] "abscess") is a {{collection}} or gathering of pus within a naturally existing anatomical cavity.

50|$|There are few {{exceptions}} to this rule: Haemophilus influenzae meningitis {{is often associated with}} subdural effusions that are mistaken for subdural <b>empyemas.</b> These effusions resolve with antibiotics and require no surgical treatment.

Surgical drainage or aspiration is often necessary to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but once the diagnosis is made no further surgical intervention is necessary.|$|R
50|$|All {{patients}} with <b>empyema</b> require outpatient follow-up with a repeat chest X-ray and inflammatory biochemistry analysis within 4 weeks following discharge.

Long-term sequelae of pleural <b>empyema</b> are rare but include bronchopleural fistula formation, recurrent <b>empyema</b> and pleural thickening, which may lead to functional lung impairment needing surgical decortication.|$|E
50|$|In pneumonia, a {{collection}} of fluid may form in the space that surrounds the lung. Occasionally, microorganisms will infect this fluid, causing an <b>empyema.</b> To distinguish an <b>empyema</b> from the more common simple parapneumonic effusion, the fluid may be collected with a needle (thoracentesis), and examined. If this shows evidence of <b>empyema,</b> complete drainage of the fluid is necessary, often requiring a drainage catheter. In severe cases of <b>empyema,</b> surgery may be needed. If the infected fluid is not drained, the infection may persist, because antibiotics do not penetrate well into the pleural cavity. If the fluid is sterile, it must be drained {{only if it is}} causing symptoms or remains unresolved.|$|E
