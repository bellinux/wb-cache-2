5000|$|The {{mechanism}} for achieving {{this result is}} as follows. The <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> <b>state</b> zero-rates the VAT. This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The importing member state [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the importing member state at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.|$|E

Distance sales treatment allows the vendor to apply domestic place of supply rules for determining which member state collects the VAT. This means that VAT is charged at the rate applicable in the <b>exporting</b> <b>member</b> <b>state.</b> However, there are some additional restrictions to be met. For instance, supply of new motor vehicles like cars, trucks and boats does not qualify. As well, a compulsory VAT registration is required for a supplier of excisable goods to the UK (like tobacco and alcohol).|$|E

The study used the relative measure of trade intensity to measure the exports and imports shares within <b>member</b> <b>states</b> and gravity model to identify factors affecting intra-SADC trade flows. The results from relative measure of trade intensity indicated that although the intra-SADC trade remains low, but figures appear to increase compared to the previous recorded facts. The analysis indicates that the share of intra-SADC exports averaged to 31. 3 percent between 2008 and 2012. More specifically, Swaziland and Zimbabwe have the highest share of their total exports, while Seychelles has the smallest share of <b>exports</b> to SADC <b>member</b> <b>states.</b> Meanwhile, the share of intra-SADC imports averaged to 35. 0 percent between 2008 and 2012 from which Lesotho and Zimbabwe had the largest share of their total imports, while South Africa has the smallest share within the region. It was found that South Africa has a comparative advantage in trade, receiving the largest share of exports and imports from other <b>member</b> <b>states</b> within the region.

40|$|Certain {{software}} products employing digital {{techniques for}} encryption of data {{are subject to}} export controls in the EU <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> pursuant to Community law and relevant laws in the <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> These controls are agreed globally {{in the framework of}} the so-called Wassenaar Arrangement. Wassenaar is an informal non-proliferation regime aimed at promoting international stability and responsibility in transfers of strategic (dual-use) products and technology. This thesis covers provisions of Wassenaar, Community export control laws and export control laws of Finland, Sweden, Germany, France and United Kingdom. This thesis consists of five chapters. The first chapter discusses the ratio of export control laws and the impact they have on global trade. The ratio is originally defence-related - in general to prevent potential adversaries of participating States from having the same tools, and in particular in the case of cryptographic software to enable signals intelligence efforts. Increasingly as the use of cryptography in a civilian context has mushroomed, export restrictions can have negative effects on civilian trade. Information security solutions may also be took weak because of export restrictions on cryptography. The second chapter covers the OECD's Cryptography Policy, which had a significant effect on its member nations' national cryptography policies and legislation. The OECD is a significant organization,because it acts as a meeting forum for most important industrialized nations. The third chapter covers the Wassenaar Arrangement. The Arrangement is covered from the viewpoint of international law and politics. The Wassenaar control list provisions affecting cryptographic software transfers are also covered in detail. Control lists in the EU and in <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are usually directly copied from Wassenaar control lists. Controls agreed in its framework set only a minimum level for participating States. However, Wassenaar countries can adopt stricter controls. The fourth chapter covers Community export control law. Export controls are viewed in Community law as falling within the domain of Common Commercial Policy pursuant to Article 133 of the EC Treaty. Therefore the Community has exclusive competence in export matters, save where a national measure is authorized by the Community or falls under foreign or security policy derogations established in Community law. The <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> still have a considerable amount of power in the domain of Common Foreign and Security Policy. They are able to maintain national export controls because export control laws are not fully harmonized. This can also have possible detrimental effects on the functioning of internal market and common export policies. In 1995 the EU adopted Dual-Use Regulation 3381 / 94 /EC, which sets common rules for <b>exports</b> in <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Provisions of this regulation receive detailed coverage in this chapter. The fifth chapter covers national legislation and export authorization practices in five different <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> - in Finland, Sweden, Germany, France and in United Kingdom. Export control laws of those <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> are covered when the national laws differ from the uniform approach of the Community's acquis communautaire...|$|R
40|$|International Merchandise Trade Statistics (IMTS) is {{a domain}} of {{official}} economic statistics with great tradition. The conventional data source of IMTS has been Customs documents, thus the basic recording principle the cross-border physical movement of goods. As long as national economies covered resident units only and units {{in different countries}} were unrelated to each other, border crossing provided a good estimation for the change of ownership between a resident and non-resident unit – the principle used in Balance of Payments and National Accounts. However, with the evolution of globalization, official ITGS statistics is facing challenges regarding its key conceptual and data collection aspects: Customs formalities are simplified and even abolished {{in the frame of}} a Customs union, non-resident units are acting as traders within the economy and a non negligible part of trade is done between related parties of multinational enterprise groups.

40|$|The EU's {{strategies}} for contributing international security and promoting global trade often contradict each other. On the one hand, EU is enhancing {{its role in}} global security issues such as Iranian nuclear development or peacekeeping in the Middle East, {{but on the other}} hand, it is encouraging European industry to export high-tech products which might be used for both civil and military purposes. The control on dual-use technology products seems to prevent some concerned parties from acquiring higher military capabilities, but at the same time, prevent European industry from enlarging its market share. Between the Commission and the <b>Member</b> <b>States,</b> who controls the dual-use goods is a crucial question for promoting their industrial and security interests. Currently, the EU sets a single rule and procedure for <b>export</b> control, but <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> own the full capacity to implement these rules. Because of that, the interpretation and exercise of EU rules on export control are not coherent among <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> This paper examines the difficulties and problems of EU for ensuring its global responsibility for export control on dual-use items. Three aspects of export control should be discussed in this paper. First, how does the EU structure the roles and responsibilities for the Commission and <b>Member</b> <b>States?</b> The Regulation 1334 / 2000 defines the role of the Commission, but it does not outline the obligations and responsibilities of <b>Member</b> <b>States.</b> Second, how does EU's strategy for improving international competitiveness through defense R&D coordinate with its strategy for export control? The launch of security R&D programs, development of European Defense Technological and Industrial Base (DTIB), and establishment of European Defense Agency (EDA) calls for more prudent approach for controlling the export of high-tech goods. Third, what is the consequence of EU enlargement in 2004 ? Including states without the experience of COCOM regime may undermine the relatively successful export control system in the EU, and would increase the risks of exporting controlled goods. Through these three aspects, this paper aims to provide analysis of EU's export control and to find whether EU would be able to fulfil its international responsibility for improving security through trade. This study would also have some implication about the troubling relationship between the Commission and the <b>Member</b> <b>States</b> in trade issues as well as security matters...|$|R

On the other hand, we analyse recent export data. This way we can get a picture on the structure and direction of exports of periphery economies and this can be compared to the aims of the given states.

The second claim is that early <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation reflected a concern to protect national laws, but that this pattern of <b>member</b> <b>state</b> participation is changing as <b>member</b> <b>state</b> evince more of a desire to influence the general trend of Commmunity law. The final claim tested is that, with the Single European Act's change to qualified majority voting in the Council, member states' attitudes of acceptance toward the Court will change, and criticism of the Court will increase.
