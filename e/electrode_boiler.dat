5000|$|An <b>electrode</b> <b>boiler</b> (jet type) {{is a type}} of boiler {{that uses}} {{electricity}} flowing through streams of water to create steam. The conductive and resistive properties of water are employed to carry electric current.|$|E

25|$|Danish {{district}} heating plants use 100 Petajoule/year, but little of this consumption is from 180MW of <b>electrode</b> <b>boilers</b> installed in powerplants or 37MW of large heat pumps. The boilers are only used to soak up the powerplant's own electricity when prices are negative, to avoid paying tax. Expansion of wind powered {{district heating}} is calculated to be economically efficient without taxes.|$|R
50|$|The {{electrodes}} {{are connected}} to a medium voltage (1-35 kV) AC source. Electrode boilers can work on both single phase and three phase supplies. If DC voltage is used, electrolysis of water occurs, decomposing water into its elements H2 at the cathode (negative electrode) and O2 at the anode (positive electrode). The <b>electrode</b> <b>boiler</b> is 99.9% efficient with almost all the energy consumed producing steam. Losses are radiant heat from the vessel only.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of <b>electrode</b> <b>boiler</b> pumps water from {{the lower part of the}} vessel to an {{internal}} header that has nozzles that allow the water to flow to electrodes. Generally the working pressure is maintained at 10 bar. If more pressure is needed (more steam) the controls speed up the pump and flow more water through additional nozzles. As the needed pressure is reached the pump controls the flow of water to obtain the desired steam output (in kg per hour) at the desired pressure. On larger systems the pump can be controlled by a variable frequency drive (VFD) so energy is not wasted. This control system can also control de-aerator pumps and controls.|$|E
5000|$|An {{electric}} {{steam boiler}} {{is intended to}} produce steam for process industry or other uses, such as drying, heat treating, and others. These are generally permanently installed systems with connections to a water supply and piping to transport product steam {{to the point of}} use. In places where electric power is relatively low cost compared to fossil fuels, it may be economically practical to use an electric boiler for steam central heating. For example, in Winnipeg, Canada, during the Second World War, large central electric steam boilers were used for a district heating system, using surplus hydroelectric power. The intent was to conserve coal fuel for more critical wartime needs. [...] Electric boilers may rely on immersion heater resistance heating elements to heat water, or may use electric current passing directly through the water as an <b>electrode</b> <b>boiler.</b>|$|E
50|$|In Denmark {{the direct}} storage of {{electricity}} {{is perceived as}} too expensive for very large scale usage, albeit significant usage is made of existing Norwegian Hydro. Instead, the use of existing {{hot water storage tanks}} connected to district heating schemes, heated by either <b>electrode</b> <b>boilers</b> or heat pumps, is seen as a preferable approach. The stored heat is then transmitted to dwellings using district heating pipes.|$|R
5000|$|Normally {{resistance}} {{heating elements}} are {{insulated from the}} water going through the boiler; sensitive ground fault leakage current detection may be installed to alarm or shut off power if an insulation failure is detected. <b>Electrode</b> <b>boilers</b> put the water supply {{in direct contact with}} the electrical supply; current collectors or other features may be provided in piping to prevent dangerous electrical hazards on connected piping.|$|R

5000|$|Danish {{district}} heating plants use 100 Petajoule/year, mostly waste heat from thermal power plants burning coal, natural gas and biomass, but {{a small part of}} this consumption is from <b>electrode</b> <b>boilers</b> or heat pumps. Expansion of wind powered {{district heating}} is calculated to be economically efficient without taxes. The peak thermal load of district heating in Copenhagen is 2.5 GWth, and simulations suggest a potential heat pump would run 3,500 load-hours per year using sewage water as the heat reservoir.|$|R
40|$|The {{extraction}} of thermal energy from large LWR and coal fired plants for long distance transport to industrial and residential/commercial users is analyzed. Transport of thermal energy as {{high temperature water}} is shown to be considerably cheaper than transport as steam, hot oil, or molten salt over a wide temperature range. The delivered heat is competitive with user-generated heat from oil, coal, or <b>electrode</b> <b>boilers</b> at distances well over 50 km when the pipeline operates at high capacity factor. Results indicate that thermal energy storage makes meeting of even very low capacity factor heat demands economic and feasible and gives the utility flexibility to meet coincident electricity and heat demands effectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of the}} {{lightweight}} nickel electrode, {{in place of the}} heavy-sintered state-of-the-art nickel electrode, will lead to improvements in specific energy and performance of the nickel-hydrogen cell. Preliminary testing indicates that a nickel fiber mat is a promising support candidate for the nickel hydroxide active material. Nickel electrodes made from fiber mats, with nickel and cobalt powder added to the fiber, were tested at LeRC. To date, over 8000 cycles have been accumulated, at 40 percent depth-of-discharge, using {{the lightweight}} fiber <b>electrode,</b> in a <b>boiler</b> plate nickel-hydrogen cell...|$|R
40|$|In 1990 Flödeskommittén {{released}} {{new guidelines}} which redefined {{the method used}} to determine design flows. The method, combined with more complete measurements of flow variations, has resulted in higher design flows which in turn call for increases in the discharge capacity of hydropower plants. This work is still in progress. Since many Swedish hydropower stations were constructed in the 1950 's and 60 's they require modernization. Today Statkraft owns and operates 55 hydropower stations in Sweden several of which have a discharge capacity below the design flow. For this reason, the dam safety of these hydropower stations is reduced. According to current guidelines the turbine flow is not added to the discharge capacity since {{the availability of the}} electrical grid is not guaranteed during extreme flows. When the electric grid is unavailable the generator has no load and cannot produce an electric torque. Without the electric torque the turbine accelerates which may result in equipment failure. This thesis considers the introduction of an alternative local load where the generator power can be dumped as heat, hence termed dump load. The dump load has the potential to increase the discharge capacity by adding the turbine flow. However, operation of the dump load requires the availability of the generator and turbine, making the discharge capacity dependent on the status of the plant. In turn, achieving a sufficient discharge capacity is of primary concern to dam operators since it determines dam safety. Consequently, this thesis evaluates the effects on dam safety when utilizing a local load to increase the discharge capacity. Three different designs were evaluated; a medium to high voltage <b>electrode</b> water <b>boiler,</b> <b>electrodes</b> submerged in the river and a low voltage electric water boiler. The evaluation shows that all three designs are feasible and can be used to increase the discharge capacity provided the generator and turbine have high availability. The complexity and number of components constituting the dump load should be minimized {{to reduce the risk of}} malfunctions and redundancy should be introduced for key components when feasible. The dump load power should be controlled using voltage regulation but further work is required to determine the specifics of this governor. The results also show that the cost of the dump load is a fraction of the cost of a new spillway. However, the topic is controversial and the dump load requires practical testing in order to evaluate operational reliability...|$|R
