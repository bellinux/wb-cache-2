5|$|The Hiroc missile used {{liquid oxygen}} as its oxidizer, and alcohol for its fuel. The Hiroc missile {{did not have}} {{separate}} tanks for its fuel and oxidizer, which were instead contained in one tank separated by a bulkhead. The frame of the rocket {{was supported by the}} pressure of the gas inside the tank, which would be either propellant when used, or inert gasses when stored. Having gas pressure provide rigidity to the structure reduced the <b>empty</b> <b>weight</b> by requiring less metallic components for structural reinforcement, but made the missile very fragile because it required continuous pressurization.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's <b>empty</b> <b>weight</b> (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E

5|$|The I-6 had an oval-section {{semi-monocoque}} fuselage {{covered with}} 'shpon', molded birch plywood, {{with a small}} headrest faired into the fuselage, although the engine was enclosed in a metal cowling that left the cylinder heads exposed for better cooling. The two-spar wings were covered in plywood and fabric and had a Clark Y profile. Internal bracing wires were fitted to reinforce the wings. The control surfaces were framed in duralumin, but covered in fabric. The duralumin N-type struts that separated the wings, and attached the upper wing to the fuselage, had a teardrop profile. They were reinforced with steel bracing wires. The conventional undercarriage was fixed with rubber shock absorbers. The wooden propeller was given a spinner. The lighter weight of the air-cooled Jupiter engine, which required neither a heavy radiator nor coolant, meant that the I-6 had an <b>empty</b> <b>weight</b> only 62% of that of the I-3.|$|E
5|$|In many respects, the T-10BM design {{outwardly}} {{resembles the}} Su-27 {{more than the}} Su-27M. During tests of the thrust-vectoring engines and the Su-27M's aerodynamic layout, Sukhoi had concluded {{that the loss of}} manoeuvrability due to the removal of the canards– the design of which imposed a weight penalty on the airframe– could be compensated for by the addition of thrust-vectoring nozzles. Industry progress in the fields of avionics and radars have also reduced the weight and size of such components, which shifted the centre of gravity of an aircraft rearward. Therefore, designers removed the canards (and the dorsal air brake) found on the Su-27M; the size of the vertical tails, aft-cockpit hump and tail boom were also reduced. With such changes, as well as the increased use of aluminium and titanium alloys and composites, designers had reduced the <b>empty</b> <b>weight</b> of the aircraft, while maintaining a similar maximum take-off weight to the Su-27M.|$|E
5|$|The P-4 {{contained}} {{many changes}} from the P-2 and P-3. The jettisonable loads {{were capable of}} considerable variation. Two external SC 1800kg (3,960lb) bombs, two LMA air-dropped anti-shipping mines, one SC 1,800kg plus four SC 250kg; or one SC 2,500kg external bomb could be carried on an ETC Rüstsatz rack. Depending on the load variation, an 835 L fuel and 120 L oil tank could be added {{in place of the}} internal bomb bay. The armament consisted of three defensive MG 15 machine guns. later supplemented by a further three MG 15s and one MG 17 machine gun. The radio communications were standard FuG X(10), Peil G V direction finding and FuBI radio devices. Due to the increase in defensive firepower, the crew numbers increased from four to five. The <b>empty</b> <b>weight</b> of the P-4 increased to 6,775kg (14,936lb), and the full takeoff weight increased to 13,500kg (29,762lb) owing to the mentioned alterations.|$|E

5|$|The third mass {{production}} {{model of the}} He 111H was the H-16, entering production in late 1942. Armament was as on the H-11, with some differences. The 20mm MG FF cannon was deleted, as the H-16s were seldom employed on low-level missions, was replaced with a single MG 131 in a flexible installation in the nose (A-Stand). On some aircraft, designated He 111H-16/R1, the dorsal position {{was replaced by a}} Drehlafette DL 131 electrically powered turret, armed with a single MG 131. The two beam and the aft ventral positions were provided with MG 81Zs, as on the H-11. The two 1,000kW (1,340hp) Jumo 211 F-2 provided a maximum speed of 434km/h (270mph) at 6,000m (19,690ft); cruising speed was 390km/h (242mph), service ceiling was 8,500m (27,900ft).Funkgerät (FuG) radio equipment. FuG 10P, FuG 16, FuBl Z and APZ 6 were fitted for communication and navigation at night, while some aircraft received the FuG 101a radio altimeter. The H-16 retained its eight ESAC internal bomb cells; four bomb cells, as on previous versions could be replaced by a fuel tank to increase range. ETC 2000 racks could be installed over the bomb cell openings for external weapons carriage. <b>Empty</b> <b>weight</b> was 6,900kg (15,210lb) and the aircraft weighed 14,000kg (30,860lb) fully loaded for take off. German factories built 1,155 H-16s between the end of 1942 and the end of 1943; in addition, 280 H-6s and 35 H-11s were updated to H-16 standard. An undetermined number of H variants were fitted with the FuG 200 Hohentwiel. The radar was adapted as an anti-shipping detector for day or night operations.|$|E

40|$|Body {{measurements}} and slaughter weight of body component (carcass and edible non-carcass) of 63 zebu oxen {{were used in}} this trial. Out of these 9 of them were slaughtered at the initial stage of the experiment. The remaining 54 oxen were allocated to various levels of feeding or plane of nutrition. From this group 24 of them were subjected to work for 24 days. <b>Empty</b> body <b>weight</b> (EBW) was calculated by subtracting the weight of gut content from slaughter weight. The coefficient of correlation on slaughter with <b>empty</b> body <b>weight</b> and hot carcass weight were 0. 98 and 0. 96 respectively. The regression of body components (<b>empty</b> body <b>weight,</b> carcass weight, lean, fat, bone, hump, external and internal offal) on slaughter weight gave better relationship {{than the rest of}} the body parts. The weights of body composition of one livestock unit (LU= 250 kg live weight) using derived equation from live <b>weight</b> indicated that <b>empty</b> body <b>weight</b> was 86 % while hot carcass was 51 % of body weight. It was observed that the coefficient correlation of slaughter <b>weight,</b> <b>empty</b> body <b>weight,</b> hot carcass weight, external offal and internal offal were well above 0. 70. Body components were moderately correlated with measured wither height, height and width of hump and body sheath. Their relationship ranged from 0. 62 to 0. 70. Bone, fat and hump were poorly related with body length. Moreover, the equation Y (Mean weight) = 1. 0223 plus minus 0. 6950 *x (body length) + 0. 0109 x square plus minus 0. 0056 had a coefficient of determination (R square) of 99. 24 % provided simple and better measuring device to estimate body weight of Zebu cattle from body length.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to estimate the requirements of energy, protein and macrominerals of grazing crossbreds calves, in Brachiaria decumbens Stapf pasture, castrated at different ages, with and without supplementation. Forty-seven young calves at initial age of 120 ± 30. 1 days and 115. 3 ± 1. 97 kg of live weight were used. To estimate net energy requirements for weight gain, a regression equation between energy retained in the gain and <b>empty</b> body <b>weight</b> gain and metabolic <b>empty</b> body <b>weight</b> was obtained. For estimation of net protein requirements for weight gain, a regression equation was adjusted between protein retained in gain and <b>empty</b> body <b>weight</b> gain and energy content of this gain.
