5|$|Branham {{claimed to}} have had a prophetic revelation in June, 1933 that {{comprised}} seven major events that would occur before the Second Coming of Christ. He believed that five of the seven predictions, relating to world politics, science, and the moral condition of the world, had been <b>fulfilled.</b> The final two visions, one related to the Roman Catholic Church gaining power in the United States and the second detailing the destruction of the United States, would be <b>fulfilled</b> by 1977, subsequent to which Christ would return. A comparison of Branham's descriptions of the prophecies reveals his tendency to exaggerate and embellish his actual predictions.|$|E
5|$|Destiny's Child {{went to a}} hiatus, {{following}} the release of their third studio album Survivor (2001), allowing {{each member of the}} group to release solo material. As each member had success with their individual projects, questions arose by the public whether they would record again as a group. However, group members Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams reunited again to work on their fourth studio album Destiny <b>Fulfilled.</b> The album was released in late 2004 and the group further embarked on a worldwide tour Destiny <b>Fulfilled...</b> and Lovin' It the following year as part of its promotion. During a concert the group had at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona, Spain on June 11, 2005, Rowland announced to the audience that the tour would be Destiny's Child last together, revealing their formal disbandment. It was announced that after their final North American leg, the group would part ways, with each member continuing their music career as a solo act. During an interview, they explained that their disbandment was planned during the making of Destiny <b>Fulfilled</b> as they discussed their individual aspirations and realized that remaining as a group would prevent them in pursuing those interests. However, it was acknowledged that the album would not be their last album together.|$|E
