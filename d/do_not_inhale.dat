In cigarette smokers the mean carboxyhaemoglobin concentration was 4. 78 % {{of the total}} haemoglobin and 94. 7 % of smokers had a concentration greater than 1. 7 %. Primary cigar smokers had a much lower mean carboxyhaemoglobin concentration (0. 93 %), and only 10. 3 % had concentrations greater than 1. 7 %. Primary pipe smokers also had a low mean carboxyhaemoglobin concentration (1. 36 %) and none had a concentration above 1. 7 %.

40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the degree to which}} cigar smokers inhale when they smoke cigars. A second objective was to assess the level of association between self-reported inhalation and ob-servable cigar particle deposition in the lung. We hypothesized that cigar smokers with a history of cigarette smoking would show a greater amount of smoke deposition than would cigar smokers with no history of cigarette smoking. We conjectured that self-reported cigar smoke inhalation would be a reliable predictor of observable smoke particle deposition in the lung. Methods: Twenty-four male cigar smokers were recruited to participate in the study. Twelve of the participants were current or past regular cigarette smokers, and the remaining 12 partic-ipants had no history of cigarette smoking. The volunteers com-pleted an anonymous questionnaire commenting on the fre-quency of their current cigarette and cigar use as well as {{the degree to which they}} inhale when they smoke cigars. Volunteers smoked a cigar through a holder that permitted cigar smoke to mix with a radioaerosol of 99 mTc-labeled sulfur colloid particles. The total radioactivity administered to each volunteer was 100 MBq. Lung ventilation scanning was subsequently performed. Results: Total lung counts showed that volunteers inhaled the cigar smoke to varying degrees, although 100 % of nonsmokers and 58 % of smokers in the study reported that they never or rarely inhaled when they smoked cigars. With respect to total lung counts, smokers as a group inhaled less than their non-smoking counterparts; however, this difference reflected a trend in the data and did not reach statistical significance.

The study sample comprised 1492 smokers of plain cigarettes and 1936 smokers of filter cigarettes, 1711 smokers of cheroots or cigars, and 233 male pipe smokers. Over the five years, smokers, especially those who said that they inhaled, had a higher rate of decline of FEV 1 than non-smokers, in whom the average decline in FEV 1 was 25 ml/year for women and 30 ml/year for men. There {{was no significant difference in}} the decline in FEV 1 between filter cigarette smokers and plain cigarette smokers. The decline in FEV 1 in cigar or cheroot smokers was the highest for all the smoking groups, and associated with a very high tobacco consumption in this group. Among pipe smokers who inhaled, the decline in FEV 1 was slightly higher than in the cigarette smokers, whereas non-inhaling pipe smokers had a decline in FEV 1 that was similar to that of non-smokers. In general, the smokers who said that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>inhale</b> had a smaller decline in FEV 1 than those who said that they did.

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{are gaining}} increasing attention due to possible health risks from occupational or environmental exposures. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} inhaled multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) would increase airway fibrosis in mice with allergic asthma. Normal and ovalbumin-sensitized mice were exposed to a MWCNT aerosol (100 mg/m 3) or saline aerosol for 6 hours. Lung injury, inflammation, and fibrosis were examined by histopathology, clinical chemistry, ELISA, or RT-PCR for cytokines/chemokines, growth factors, and collagen at 1 and 14 days after inhalation. Inhaled MWCNT were distributed throughout the lung and found in macrophages by light microscopy, but were also evident in epithelial cells by electron microscopy. Quantitative morphometry showed significant airway fibrosis at 14 days in mice that received a combination of ovalbumin and MWCNT, but not in mice that received ovalbumin or MWCNT only. Ovalbumin-sensitized mice that <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>inhale</b> MWCNT had elevated levels IL- 13 and transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 in lung lavage fluid, but not platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) -AA. In contrast, unsensitized mice that inhaled MWCNT had elevated PDGF-AA, but not increased levels of TGF-β 1 and IL- 13. This suggested that airway fibrosis resulting from combined ovalbumin sensitization and MWCNT inhalation requires PDGF, a potent fibroblast mitogen, and TGF-β 1, which stimulates collagen production. Combined ovalbumin sensitization and MWCNT inhalation also synergistically increased IL- 5 mRNA levels, which could further contribute to airway fibrosis. These data indicate that inhaled MWCNT require pre-existing inflammation to cause airway fibrosis. Our findings suggest that individuals with pre-existing allergic inflammation may be susceptible to airway fibrosis from inhaled MWCNT...|$|R

Group I (148 children-treated group) consisted of all the children using inhaled steroids on a regular basis and group II (50 children-untreated group) included patients with mild intermittent asthma who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> use <b>inhaled</b> steroids and were treated with bronchodilators as needed. Detailed medication and compliance history were recorded and the children underwent regular pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry and physician examination. ResultsThe incidence of airways remodeling as defined by the low FEV 1 /FVC post-bronchodilator was markedly increased over the 5 -year period in the untreated group compared to the treated group. In the treated group the FEV 1 /FVC ratio post-bronchodilator decreased from 35 % to 20. 9 % (P< 0. 009 %) compared with the untreated group where the number of children with low FEV 1 /FVC post-bronchodilator increased from 10 % to 28 % {{by the end of the}} study period.

Methods: Asthma control was examined in a survey of 1, 014 Japanese pediatric patients with bronchial asthma. The occurrence of common cold, asthma control, and drugs used for asthma control were investigated using a modified Childhood Asthma Control Test (C-ACT) for patients aged 4 years old. In patients aged < 4 years old with a common cold, asthma control was significantly more effective for those treated with leukotriene receptor antagonists (LTRAs) compared to treatment without LTRAs.

MethodsThirty-four primary isolates were identified to species level and subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Effectiveness of early antimicrobial treatment was assessed by a Kaplan–Meier estimation of time to recurrence. ResultsAchromobacter xylosoxidans accounted for 13 (38 %) of the isolates, and an unnamed species accounted for 11 (32 %) of the isolates. Meropenem, piperacillin–tazobactam and trimethoprim–sulfamethoxazole were highly active against chemotherapy-naïve Achromobacter, while ceftazidime, colistin and tobramycin were judged adequate for inhalation therapy.

40|$|Postoperative acute lung injury (ALI) compromises oxygen {{transfer}} across alveolar-capillary membrane with consecutive hypoxia, {{one of its}} indicators being reduction of oxygenation index PaO 2 /FiO 2 below 40 kPa (300 mm Hg). Management of ALI includes different procedures like mechanical lung ventilation (MLV), drugs and others. One of the new possibilities for treatment of ALI is nitric oxide (NO) inhalation. The aim of this prospective {{study was to examine}} the role of NO inhalation in treatment of ALI. 14 patients with ALI developed immediately after operation with extracorporeal circulation (ECC) were included in the study. Group A (n = 8) inhaled NO and group B (n = 6) <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>inhale</b> NO during treatment of ALI. All other therapeutic measures were the same in both groups. The groups were similar in relation to demographic data, type of surgery and duration of ECC. PaO 2 /FiO 2 was calculated before operation (T 1), immediately after surgery (T 2) and after lung recovery, when the need for MLV stopped (T 3). The duration of MLV was also registered. PaO 2 /FiO 2 (kPa) in referent times was in group A 54, 9 ± 1, 6, 33, 8 ± 1, 2 and 46, 2 ± 0, 8 and in group B 52, 2 ± 1, 1, 33, 5 ± 1, 5 and 47, 3 ± 0, 9, respectively.
