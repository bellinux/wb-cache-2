500|$|Cunningham {{was born}} at Rathmines, County Dublin, on 7 January 1883, the third of five {{children}} born to Professor Daniel John Cunningham and his wife Elizabeth Cumming Browne, both of Scottish ancestry. General Sir Alan Cunningham was his younger brother. His parents were described as having a [...] "strong intellectual and clerical tradition," [...] both grandfathers having been in the clergy. His father was a Professor of Anatomy at Trinity College, Dublin, whilst his mother stayed at home. Elizabeth Browne, {{with the aid of}} servants and governesses, oversaw much of his upbringing; as a result he reportedly had a [...] "warm and close" [...] relationship with her. After a short introduction to schooling in Dublin he was sent to Edinburgh Academy, where he stayed with his aunts <b>Doodles</b> and Connie May. At the age of ten he received a telegram from his father asking [...] "would you like to go into the Navy?" [...] At the time, the family had no maritime connections, and Cunningham only had a vague interest in the sea. Nevertheless, he replied [...] "Yes, I should like to be an Admiral". He was then sent to a Naval Preparatory School, Stubbington House, which specialised in sending pupils through the Dartmouth entrance examinations. Cunningham passed the exams, showing particular strength in mathematics.|$|E

40|$|A <b>doodle</b> is {{a simple}} drawing that is usually made {{to pass the time}} during a boring meeting, {{classroom}} lecture, or a prolonged telephonic conversation.

However, the act of <b>doodling</b> is of enduring interest to scientists as they believe that <b>doodling</b> research might actually reveal significant insights about the functioning of the subconscious mind. The widely held misconception about <b>doodling</b> as being just a way to ease one's boredom is all set to change since the findings of some recent researchers have shown that <b>doodling</b> might actually aid one's memory and recall performance.
