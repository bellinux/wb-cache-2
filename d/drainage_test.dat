30|$|Most {{carbonate}} reservoirs in Middle East {{are characterized}} as porous fractured reservoirs. Estimation of relative permeability of these highly heterogeneous reservoirs is challenging {{due to the}} existence of discontinuity in the fluid flow fractured porous media. Although relative permeability is an essential data for simulation of flow in fractured media, few attempts have so far been made to estimate the relative permeability curves. Most notable are the studies by Akin (J Pet Sci Eng 30 (1) 1 – 14, 2001), Al-sumaiti and Kazemi (2012), and Fahad (2013). This paper presents an integrated approach to history matching the oil <b>drainage</b> <b>tests,</b> which were carried out by unsteady state, on glass bed models with a single fracture at different orientations and to estimate the relative permeability curve. The integrated approach includes an inversion algorithm coupled with forward numerical modeling of fluid flow. The history matching of the displacement test data was obtained by using the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm to minimize the error between the simulated and experimental data. In this algorithm, Corey-type power law is used to create relative permeability curves during the optimization procedures. The forward modeling is a 3 D multiphase fluid simulator for flow through discrete fractures. Numerical results of fluid flow profiles and the optimized relative permeability curves for single fracture with different orientations and experimental validation with oil <b>drainage</b> <b>tests</b> are presented. The results of the optimized relative permeability data for single fracture are in a good agreement with the data derived by the correlation of Fahad (2013). These results prove that the presented approach can be used to upscale the relative permeability curve from laboratory scale to reservoir grid scale. The work on the upscaling of the estimated relative permeability curve of fractured porous media is under preparation and will be published soon.|$|R

30|$|The notable {{two-phase}} displacement {{experiments that}} are conducted in fractured porous media include {{the work of}} Akin (2001) and Fahad (2013). Akin (2001) used a history matching technique to calculate relative permeability curve from steady-state experimental data which was carried out on a core sample with a single vertical fracture. The author used a dual-porosity/dual-permeability approach to simulate fluid flow. Akin (2001) found that the fracture relative permeability is a power law function of the corresponding phase saturation. Fahad (2013) performed unsteady-state <b>drainage</b> <b>tests</b> on a glass bead model using single and multiple fractures (both parallel and intersected) with different orientation angles. Based on the results, the authors proposed a new equation for relative permeability for fractured porous media.

The experimental results also showed that the relative permeability is not a linear function of phase saturation.|$|R

The binder <b>drainage</b> <b>test,</b> {{developed by the}} Transport Research Laboratory, UK, is commonly used to set an upper limit on the acceptable binder content for a porous mix. This paper {{presents the results of}} a laboratory investigation {{to determine the effects of}} different binder types on the binder drainage characteristics of porous mix made of various maximum aggregate sizes 20, 14 and 10 mm. Two types of binder were used, conventional 60 / 70 pen bitumen, and styrene butadiene styrene (SBS) modified bitumen. The amount of binder lost through drainage after three hours at the maximum mixing temperature were measured in duplicate for mixes of different maximum sizes and binder contents. The maximum mixing temperature adopted depends on the types of binder used. The retained binder is plotted against the initial mixed binder content, together with the line of equality where the retained binder equals the mixed binder content. The results indicate the significant contribution of using SBS modified bitumen to increase the target bitumen binder content. Their significance is discussed in terms of target binder content, the critical binder content, the maximum mixed binder content and the maximum retained binder content values obtained from the binder <b>drainage</b> <b>test.</b> It was concluded that increasing maximum aggregate sizes decrease the maximum retained binder content, critical binder content, target binder content, maximum mixed binder content, and mixed content for both binders, but however for all mixtures, SBS is the highest...|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic {{properties}} {{should be}} determined at {{the scale of}} the process modeled. The methods to hydraulically characterize a soil in situ remain extremely difficult to implement, requiring measurements of water content and pressure head with adequate time–depth resolution. We recently proposed a method that reduced the number of field measurements required for complete field hydraulic characterization. In this paper, we extend the previous method to cases where the only available information consists of laboratory hydraulic properties, along with a measurement of the maximum water content in the field, whose value depends on the way the wetting of the porous medium is performed. Specifically, the field hydraulic parameters were estimated with a scaling procedure accounting for the ratio between the total porosity estimated by the maximum water content in the laboratory and the partial porosity effectively involved in the field, as estimated by the field-measured maximum water content. The scaling method was evaluated with data from four soils (three volcanic sandy loam soils and one silty clay loam soil). Soil hydraulic properties were measured both in situ by a field internal <b>drainage</b> <b>test</b> and in the laboratory in an evaporation experiment (Wind’s method). Scaling-based hydraulic properties were also compared with those estimated by applying a simplified method based on the unit-gradient water flow assumption where only water content measurements performed during the internal <b>drainage</b> <b>test</b> were of concern. The hydraulic properties estimated with the scaling method were compared with the measured ones and with those from the unit-gradient method in terms of the Relative Mean Error (RME) and Relative Root Square Mean Error (RRMSE). The scaling method proved to be especially effective when applied to the three sandy loam soils, where scaled retention and hydraulic conductivity curves to a large extent reproduced those measured in the field. For the silty clay loam soil, appropriate results were observed only for the water retention curve, while poorer scaled hydraulic conductivity was obtained...|$|E

40|$|Imhoff, Paul T. Laboratory {{tests were}} {{conducted}} on two types of waste samples in order to explore how the hydraulic properties and constitutive relationships of waste samples can vary. The first waste sample was idealized and composed entirely of newspaper. The second set of samples {{was made up of}} components typically found in municipal solid waste landfills. The tests used were developed by Han (2009) and performed as a continuation of his research. Saturated hydraulic conductivity, drainage, multi step outflow, and porosity tests were performed on a newspaper sample similar to those used by Han (2009), but packed to a higher compaction density. The results of those tests supported conclusions drawn by Han (2009). First, a dual permeability model is needed to accurately describe the hydraulic behavior of an idealized waste sample and it is likely that such a model would be necessary to describe real waste. Second, although physical manipulations of the waste (i. e. changing the compaction density) can alter the fracture properties of the waste significantly, there is very little variation in the matrix properties of the waste. This suggests that the matrix domain of landfilled waste should be similar if the compositions of porous materials in the landfills are similar. Four real waste samples with very similar compositions were studied using modified versions of the saturated hydraulic conductivity, <b>drainage,</b> and porosity <b>tests</b> developed for the newspaper samples. The data collected from the tests was inversely modeled using HYDRUS- 1 D and one of two assumptions. First, it could be assumed that the pore structure of the waste could be described by a single pore domain model. The second assumption was that the waste was better described as a dual domain system and the behavior observed in the <b>drainage</b> <b>tests</b> could be used to describe only the fracture domain.

Measurements are carried out with pure water for threedifferent wires (fabrics) : A non-permeable,a semi-permeable anda conventional wire. Although not used in paper making,thenon-permeable wire is useful when trying to understand thefundamental mechanics of roll forming. The semi-permeable wirewith finite but low permeability is used to model the effectsof the fibre web on the <b>drainage.</b> <b>Tests</b> have mainly been carried out for different wiretensions and different jet speeds. It is shown that the localcurvature of the wire is strongly correlated to the dewateringpressure. The conventiona wire shows a single pressure peak causingcomplete de- watering {{in the first part of}} the dewateringzone. The pressure distributions for the non-and semi-permeablewires are found to show two consecutive pressure peaks followedby a suction peak where the wire is taken of the roll. Thisoscillating behaviour is due to capillary waves where the wiretension plays the role of surface tension on a free surface. Thewavy behaviour of the wire is recovered from an analyticalmodel and the effect is governed by a dimensionless Webernumber. The measured wave lengths correspond well to thosegiven by the theory. When the wire tension is high,i. e. a high dewateringpressure,the flow in the impingement region collapses when thedynamic pressure of the headbox jet is about half of thedewatering pressure.

A regular cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) circuit was used as a right ventricular assist device (RVAD) (jugular vein/pulmonary artery), and preload conditions were adjusted by storage (or perfusion) of blood into (or from) the venous reservoir. LA and LV <b>drainage,</b> <b>tested</b> separately or simultaneously, was measured by its effect on the LVAD's performance. The LVAD was used alone on a beating heart or together with the RVAD (biVAD) on a beating and on a fibrillating heart.

Drainage through the LA or the LV was similar when CVP was set at 8 mm Hg, and increasing CVP to 14 mm Hg allowed for better drainage through the LV cannula. In contrast, after induction of fibrillation to mimic extreme heart failure, the drainage was better through the LA cannula. Using both LA and LV cannulae simultaneously did not improve the LVAD output in any of the conditions tested.
