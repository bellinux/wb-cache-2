5|$|Principal {{photography}} ended {{three days}} before Christmas 1977, on the Choctawhatchee Bay, near Destin, Florida. The actors had to put ice cubes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> to prevent their breath showing on camera. The final sequence to be filmed was the shark being electrocuted on the cable. In mid-January, the crew reconvened in Hollywood {{with some of the}} teenage actors for five weeks of post-production photography.|$|E
5|$|Between 1960 and 1992, the Navy {{carried out}} a program that {{included}} the study of marine mammals' abilities with sonar, {{with the objective of}} improving the detection of underwater objects. A large number of belugas were used from 1975 on, the first being dolphins. The program also included training them to carry equipment and material to divers working underwater by holding cameras <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> to locate lost objects, survey ships and submarines, and underwater monitoring. A similar program was used by the Russian Navy during the Cold War, in which belugas were also trained for antimining operations in the Arctic.|$|E

5|$|Zen-Yi recovers {{and joins}} Jack and the {{blacksmith}}. Meanwhile, Blossom offers to let Silver hide {{the gold in}} a secret tomb beneath the brothel in return for payment. The gold is stored in a coffin which is raised up to the rafters. That night, Blossom has her girls serve the Lions, and Silk serves Brass. At Blossom's signal, the girls use weapons hidden <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> to poison many of the Lions, and they join with Blossom as the Black Widows. When Silk tries to poison Brass, his skin protects him, and he beats and almost kills her. Zen-Yi, Jack, and the blacksmith arrive and join with the Black Widows to fight the remaining Lions while Blossom and Bronze fight and kill each other. While fighting Jack, Poison Dagger is crushed between large moving gears. Silver and Zen-Yi fight in the tomb; Zen-Yi cuts the coffin free, and it crushes Silver. The blacksmith finds Silk, who dies in his arms. He confronts Brass, and his iron fists prove capable of inflicting damage on Brass' seemingly invincible body. While Brass is in metal form, a powerful punch from the blacksmith shatters him to pieces. Jack runs outside in time to stop the soldiers from decimating the building with Gatling guns.|$|E
25|$|Cat-scratch {{disease is}} a {{bacterial}} disease that people may get after being bitten or scratched by a cat. About 40% of cats carry the bacteria at some time <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths,</b> although kittens younger than 1 year of age {{are more likely to}} have it.|$|E
25|$|Several {{species of}} {{osteoglossids}} exhibit parental care. They build nests and protect their young after they hatch. All species are mouthbrooders, the parents holding sometimes hundreds of eggs <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> The young may make several tentative trips outside the parent's mouth {{to investigate the}} surroundings before leaving permanently.|$|E

25|$|Young {{children}} {{are particularly vulnerable}} to ingesting feces of other people that are lying around after open defecation, because young children crawl on the ground, walk barefoot, and put things <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> without washing their hands. Feces of farmed animals are equally a cause of concern when {{children are}} playing in the yard.|$|E
25|$|Ovophile mouthbrooders {{incubate}} {{their eggs}} <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> {{as soon as}} they are laid, and frequently mouthbrood free-swimming fry for several weeks. Examples include many East African Rift lakes (Lake Malawi, Lake Tanganyika and Lake Victoria) endemics, e.g.: Maylandia, Pseudotropheus, Tropheus, and Astatotilapia burtoni, along with some South American cichlids such as Geophagus steindachneri.|$|E
25|$|C. perspicillata has a {{very good}} sense of smell, good visual acuity, and they show less {{specialization}} in their auditory apparatus as opposed to insectivorous bats. However, they still employ echolocation as a primary method of orientation. They use calls that originate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> or nostrils, which are intense, and {{have been shown to be}} the most directional sonar beams in any species of echolocating bat.|$|E

25|$|Prior to laying {{their eggs}} on a {{vertical}} rock face, {{male and female}} whitetail major damselfish clean the site by sand-blasting it. The fish pick up sand <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> and spit it against the rock face. Then they fan the area with their fins. Finally they remove the sand grains that remain stuck to the rock face by picking them off with their mouths.|$|E
25|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Stenogastrinae, L. vechti secrete a type of gelatinous substance (which is produced by the Dufour’s gland) from their abdomens, which they use {{to care for the}} offspring and to lay their eggs. The females collect the pap with their front legs and then hold it <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> while they lay eggs, and pap collection is performed before and after each egg is laid.|$|E
25|$|Pure {{water is}} usually {{described}} as tasteless and odorless, although humans have specific sensors that {{can feel the}} presence of water <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths,</b> and frogs {{are known to be}} able to smell it. However, water from ordinary sources (including bottled mineral water) usually has many dissolved substances, that may give it varying tastes and odors. Humans and other animals have developed senses that enable them to evaluate the potability of water by avoiding water that is too salty or putrid.|$|E
50|$|Cricket-spitting is a sport wherein {{contestant}}s place a dead cricket <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth,</b> {{and then}} spit {{it as far}} as they can. The contestant who can spit the cricket the farthest is declared the winner.|$|R
5000|$|Tailgate BBQ: Similar to the {{original}} challenge [...] "Sausage Party" [...] from Free Agents, players have to roll themselves along a [...] "barbecue-style" [...] obstacle course, while covered in shrink wrap. Each player will wiggle and roll {{through a variety of}} [...] "condiments" [...] and on oversize metal bars that resemble a grill grate, and toward place mats with hot dog labels on them. Certain players from each team will have to hold a [...] "chip" [...] bag <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth.</b> If they do not hold it <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth</b> the entire way through, a two-minute penalty will be added to their team total. The team with the shortest time wins.|$|R
50|$|A similar vacuum {{activity}} to tongue rolling is 'vacuum chewing' by pigs. In this behaviour, pigs perform all the activities associated with chewing {{but with no}} substrate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth.</b> This abnormal behaviour can represent 52-80% of all stereotyped behaviours.|$|R
25|$|Vennema listed 27 graves with a {{total of}} 2397 bodies, most of which had been executed. He cited {{numerous}} eyewitness accounts of executions by PAVN and VC troops and described the condition of bodies found in the graves. Many had their hands tied behind their backs. Some were shot in the head. Some had rags stuffed <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> and had no evidence of wounds, apparently having been buried alive. Some had evidence of having been beaten. A few were identified as PAVN or VC troops killed during the battle.|$|E
25|$|In May 1992 Soda {{embarked}} {{on a tour of}} Spain with shows in Madrid, Oviedo, Sevilla, Valencia, and Barcelona.The lackluster results of the Spanish tour, compared to the fervor they were accustomed to in Latin America, left a sour taste <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> Nevertheless, it did serve as a valid experience, specifically in bringing the band back to earth. To put it bluntly: Spain was in no way a failure, but was far from the success that Soda had been used to in Latin America, {{in the end it was}} a good learning experience.|$|E
25|$|In aggregations, Indian rhinos {{are often}} friendly. They will often greet {{each other by}} waving or bobbing their heads, {{mounting}} flanks, nuzzling noses, or licking. Rhinos will playfully spar, run around, and play with twigs <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> Adult males are the primary instigators in fights. Fights between dominant males {{are the most common}} cause of rhino mortality, and males are also very aggressive toward females during courtship. Males will chase females over long distances and even attack them face-to-face. Unlike African rhinos, the Indian rhino fights with its incisors, rather than its horns.|$|E
25|$|Population of {{the country}} {{did not have a}} bed or chair to sit, and to eat they do not use a spoon or chopsticks. Men and women enjoy chewing betel nut mixed with, betel leaves, and white chalk made from ground mussels shells. They eat rice for meal, first they took a scoop of water and soak betel <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth,</b> then wash <b>their</b> hands and sit down to make a circle; getting a plate of rice soaked in butter (probably coconut milk) and gravy, and eat using hands to lift the rice and put it <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth.</b> When {{receiving}} guests, they will offer the guests, not the tea, but with betel nut.|$|R
50|$|Action: The thick, hollow {{mouthpiece}} {{spreads out}} pressure, thought {{to make it}} less severe. However, this effect varies with the mouth structure of the individual horse. Some horses prefer a smaller diameter bit <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth</b> because <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> do not have room for the thick mouthpieces, and in such cases a hollow mouth bit may cause discomfort.|$|R

25|$|For toy safety, {{every country}} {{has its own}} regulations. But since the {{globalization}} and opening of markets, most of them try to harmonize their regulations. The most common action for younger children is to put toys <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths.</b> This {{is why it is}} of utmost importance to regulate chemicals which are contained in the paintings and other materials children's products are made of. Countries or trade zones such as the European Union regularly publish lists to regulate the quantities or ban chemicals from toys and juvenile products.|$|E
25|$|After another {{incident}} of desecration of the Koran, Kurnaz said that Afghan prisoners tore down a ceiling fan, honed blades, and attacked their captors using the fan blades as swords. No soldiers were killed, though some were badly bloodied. Three more prisoners subsequently died. Kurnaz {{said that people}} from the cellblock of these prisoners {{talked to him about}} events. They described the metal shutters being closed. They said that night, soldiers carried three of the prisoners out of their cells dead, with pieces of torn sheet <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouths</b> and other torn sheets binding their arms and legs. US authorities said these three prisoners had committed suicide.|$|E

50|$|Spacers can be {{especially}} helpful to adults and children who find a regular metered dose inhaler hard to use. People who use corticosteroid inhalers should use a spacer to prevent getting the medicine <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth,</b> where oral yeast infections and dysphonia can occur.|$|R
5000|$|This type of choking {{is often}} {{suffered}} by small children, {{who are unable}} to appreciate the hazard inherent in putting small objects <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth.</b> [...] <b>In</b> adults, it mostly occurs while the patient is eating. In one study, peanuts were the most common obstruction.|$|R
40|$|Behavioural mimicry is a {{potential}} mechanism explaining why adolescents appear {{to be influenced by}} their parents' eating behaviour. In the current study we examined whether there is evidence that adolescent females mimic their parents when eating. Videos of thirty-eight parent and female adolescent dyads eating a lunchtime meal together were examined. We tested whether a parent placing a food item into <b>their</b> <b>mouth</b> was associated with an increased likelihood that their adolescent child would place any food item (non-specific mimicry) or the same item (specific mimicry) <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth</b> at three different time frames, namely, during the same second or within the next fifteen seconds (+ 15), five seconds (+ 5) or two second (+ 2) period. Parents and adolescents' overall food intake was positively correlated, whereby a parent eating a larger amount of food was associated with the adolescent eating a larger meal. Across all of the three time frames adolescents were more likely to place a food item <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth</b> if <b>their</b> parent had recently placed that same food item <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>mouth</b> (specific food item mimicry); however, {{there was no evidence of}} non-specific mimicry. This observational study suggests that when eating in a social context there is evidence that adolescent females may mimic their parental eating behaviour, selecting and eating more of a food item if their parent has just started to eat that food...|$|R
