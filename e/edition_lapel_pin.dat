5000|$|In 1999, Beretta USA offered 2000 {{special edition}} kits to {{accompany}} the 8045F Cougar. Accompanying the basic 8045F was a kit consisting of a special <b>edition</b> case, <b>lapel</b> <b>pin</b> and charcoal laminate grips with inlaid cougar medallions. Several kits were sold {{but the number of}} kits is unconfirmed. With 2000 units initially projected, it is believed the total number sold to be far less than that. There is no specific serial number run for these as the kits were sold with the standard pistol as they were ordered. Typically, the Cat Pak cougars had a date code of BM for 1999. 8045 Cat Pak pistols are listed as such in Beretta USA records but it is unclear if all kits had that code since some were sold separately (did not include the pistol). The pistol comes in the 8045F model which is a double/single-action-type pistol. Standard white dot sights and factory black plastic grips are standard with the [...] "Pak" [...] consisting of the case, wood grips and pin. These models are becoming increasingly rare and value is estimated in the $650-$800 range depending on condition.|$|R
