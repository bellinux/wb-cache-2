40|$|Cream {{cheese is}} a soft fresh acid-coagulated cheese product, which is acidified by {{mesophilic}} lactic acid starter culture, i. e. Lactococcus and Leuconostoc. Cream cheese products are categorized into two main types {{based on the}} different fat content in the initial mix and the final composition. These are <b>double-cream</b> <b>cheese</b> with at least 9 - 11 % fat content in the initial mix, and single-cream cheese with 4. 5 - 5 % fat content in initial mix. Cream cheese was first made by using the cooked-curd method, which {{was developed in the}} early twenties, and the cold-pack and hot-pack methods were developed, and are still used at present. The products with high quality should have a uniform white to light cream color with a lightly lactic acid and cultured diacetyl flavor and aroma. The texture of the products should be smooth without lumps, grittiness, or any indication of cracking and wheying off, and with the ability to spread at room temperature...|$|E

50|$|The moist, rich, {{white cheese}} has {{characteristic}} {{olive green mould}} veins throughout and a smooth, creamy texture with a subtle mild spicy taste resembling a softer, and finer Roquefort in presentation and taste. It is not as salty as more traditional blue cheese, and its tangy and creamy nature are balanced so not to overpower with a sharp bite, although this is dependent {{in the age of}} the cheese. Owing to its <b>double-cream</b> nature, this <b>cheese</b> is easily spread and also melts well.|$|R
