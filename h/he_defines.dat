5|$|Nils Melzer {{presents}} an historical, legal and moral examination of targeted killing. The author observes that after September 11, the Western world grew {{more supportive of}} targeted killing than ever before. The book recounts in depth how state-sanctioned targeted killing is perceived in other countries. <b>He</b> <b>defines</b> targeted killing as the premeditated selection of an individual person not yet in custody for elimination by force. Melzer analyzes {{all areas of the}} topic.|$|E
5|$|Culik {{begins with}} the {{observation}} that a cellular automaton has an injective transition function {{if and only if}} the transition function is injective on the subsets of configurations that are periodic (repeating the same substring infinitely often in both directions). <b>He</b> <b>defines</b> a nondeterministic finite-state transducer that performs the transition rule of the automaton on periodic strings. This transducer works by remembering the neighborhood of the automaton {{at the start of the}} string and entering an accepting state when that neighborhood concatenated to the end of the input would cause its nondeterministically chosen transitions to be correct. Culik then swaps the input and output of the transducer. The transducer resulting from this swap simulates the inverse dynamics of the given automaton. Finally, Culik applies previously known algorithms to test whether the resulting swapped transducer maps each input to a single output.|$|E

25|$|The 1st-century BC grammarian Tryphon {{refers to}} Androcydes’ {{work in a}} section on {{literary}} enigmata, which <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> as darkened or obscured allegories. Tryphon implies that Androcydes made no strong distinction between poetic and philosophical modes of discourse, in that he cited passages from Hesiod in interpreting the Pythagorean symbols.|$|E
25|$|Paul {{broke with}} his party by voting against the PATRIOT Act in 2001; he also voted against its 2005 enactment. He has spoken against federal use of what <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> as torture {{and what he}} sees as an abuse of {{executive}} authority during the Iraq War to override Constitutional rights.|$|E
25|$|Ian Gordon {{suggests}} that the many incarnations of Superman across media use nostalgia to link the character to an ideology of the American Way. <b>He</b> <b>defines</b> this ideology {{as a means of}} associating individualism, consumerism, and democracy and as something that took shape around WWII and underpinned the war effort. Superman he notes was very much part of that effort.|$|E

25|$|Cauchy (1789–1857) {{started the}} project of formulating and proving the theorems of infinitesimal {{calculus}} in a rigorous manner, rejecting the heuristic principle of the generality of algebra exploited by earlier authors. In his 1821 work Cours d'Analyse <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> infinitely small quantities in terms of decreasing sequences that converge to 0, which he then used to define continuity. But he did not formalize his notion of convergence.|$|E
25|$|In Paul Tillich's work The Courage to Be <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> courage as the self-affirmation of one’s {{being in}} spite of a threat of nonbeing. He relates courage to anxiety, anxiety being the threat of non-being and the courage to be what we use to combat that threat. For Tillich, he {{outlines}} three types of anxiety and thus three ways to display the courage to be.|$|E
25|$|Aristotle applies {{his theory}} of hylomorphism to living things. <b>He</b> <b>defines</b> a soul as that which makes a living thing alive. Life is a {{property}} of living things, just as knowledge and health are. Therefore, a soul is a form—that is, a specifying principle or cause—of a living thing. Furthermore, Aristotle says that a soul is related to its body as form to matter.|$|E

25|$|In , Harris {{writes that}} the purpose of spirituality (as <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> it – he concedes that the term's uses are diverse and {{sometimes}} indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of consciousness. He argues this process of realization is based on experience and is not contingent on faith. In the same book, he describes his experience with Dzogchen, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.|$|E
25|$|Meno {{seems to}} commit two fallacies {{when trying to}} define virtue. He either defines it using some form of the word itself, or <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> it using other words that call for {{definitions}} and explanations themselves. Eventually, Meno is led to confess his shortcomings {{as he tries to}} define the enigmatic term (the Socratic method is the mechanism that brings about this confession). Socrates claims that a definition of virtue must consist of common terms and concepts that are clearly understood by those in the discussion.|$|E
25|$|As well, many of Aristotle’s {{conclusions}} directly oppose {{those of}} twentieth century narratologists such as Vladimir Propp, who “reverses Aristotle's theory that ‘tragedy is imitation not {{of human beings}} but of actions,’ by writing that stories are about characters who act”. Propp also argues that basic story elements, which <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> as functions, “are in fact ethically colored, either in themselves or because they are {{defined in terms of}} a character who has specific ethical qualities”. Propp’s viewpoint directly conflicts with that of Aristotle in Poetics because Aristotle states that drama consists of a logical sequence of events that is not affected by ethical dilemmas.|$|E

500|$|Setians {{believe in}} the {{existence}} of magic as a force which can be manipulated through ritual, however the nature of these rituals is not prescribed by the Temple. Specifically, Aquino described Setian practices as [...] "black magic", a term which <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> idiosyncratically.|$|E

In addition to art, Metzen's interests include pop and rock music, the nightlife, and dirt bikes.|$|E

500|$|In De Prospectiva Pingendi, Piero {{transforms}} his empirical {{observations of}} the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: <b>he</b> <b>defines</b> the point as [...] "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend". He uses deductive logic to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.|$|E
500|$|First, Richman {{defines a}} nonnegative decimal number to be a literal decimal expansion. <b>He</b> <b>defines</b> the {{lexicographical}} order and an addition operation, noting that 0.999... < 1 simply because 0 < 1 in the ones place, but for any nonterminating x, one has 0.999... + x = 1 + x. So one peculiarity of the decimal numbers is that addition cannot always be cancelled; {{another is that}} no decimal number corresponds to [...] After defining multiplication, the decimal numbers form a positive, totally ordered, commutative semiring.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 {{evaluation}} of state governors' fiscal policies, the libertarian Cato Institute praised Huntsman's conservative tax policies, ranking {{him in a}} tie for fifth place on overall fiscal policy. He was particularly lauded for his efforts to cut taxes. The report specifically highlighted his reductions of the sales tax and simplification of the tax code. However, the report concluded that: [...] "Unfortunately, Huntsman has completely dropped the ball on spending, with per capita spending increasing at about 10 percent annually during his tenure."
