Recent {{technological}} advancements {{in the field}} of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) manufacturing has {{opened the door to the}} idea of using ubiquitous networks of wireless sensor nodes to achieve artificially intelligent control spaces; however, to be feasible, this technology demands an onboard power supply capable of lasting the expected lifetime of each sensor node.

Additionally, a Matlab design tool simulating a shearing, single-phase, electromagnetic VEH system is presented. A VEH prototype was developed to test the tuning model, and validate the results of the Matlab design tool. The tuning models predicted that current materials available for the fabrication of a well-optimized electromagnetic VEH system are 3 - 4 orders of magnitude below what is required for tuning a measurable/useful amount—this result was corroborated in the VEH prototype.

40|$|Neural {{prostheses}} are micron-scale {{integrated circuit}} devices {{that are under}} development {{for the treatment of}} brain and spinal cord injuries. A key challenge in the fabrication of these silicon- based devices is the protection of <b>the</b> electronic components <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambient</b> body <b>environment.</b> There is a need for a biopassivation coating on these devices that is chemically inert and electrically insulating with good adhesion to the underlying silicon substrate. Fluorocarbon-organosilicon copolymers are of interest for this application because they have the desirable attributes of both fluorocarbon and organosilicon polymers, such as low dielectric constant, thermal stability, and good adhesion to silicon. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is an attractive synthetic technique for this application because it is single-step, requires no solvent, and allows conformal coatings to be deposited on substrates with complex topographies and small dimensions. Fluorocarbon-organosilicon copolymers have been synthesized by hot-filament CVD, a thermal CVD technique. Control over deposition rate and chemical structure is achieved by precursor choice and variation of filament temperature. Chemical characterization by infrared (FTIR), x-ray photoelectron (XPS), and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies indicates that the copolymer films range from highly cross-linked films to flexible films comprised mostly of linear polymer chains. This variation in chemical composition influences physical properties such as thermal stability and flexibility. The possibility of creating bioactive surface coatings has been explored by using the techniques of CVD and solution chemistry in combination. Chains of poly(acrylamide) have been grafted onto fluorocarbon-organosilicon films as a first step towards the design of bioactive coatings that could potentially enhance the performance of medical implants. by Shashi Krishna Murthy.

40|$|In recent years, high {{frequency}} MMICs have witnessed rapid development {{in terms of}} miniaturization, higher powers and increasing functionality, whilst the cost per unit has been simultaneously reduced. Cost-wise, modern packages {{have been unable to}} follow the same trend as the reduction seen in semiconductor costs and in some cases the package cost has even become {{a significant part of the}} overall module cost. Historically, the diverse range of MMIC applications has always demanded electrically transparent packages to house the on-chip circuits and isolate them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hostile <b>ambient</b> <b>environment.</b> <b>The</b> other vital role for MMIC packages is to provide good thermal dissipation for the circuits they contain. Thermal issues associated with most packages have led to the invention of different kinds of thermal pastes and strips to help dissipate the excessive heat generated by active devices. However, the thermal design of the package itself remains the basic foundation for a package with good thermal behaviour. To evaluate the performance of {{high frequency}} semiconductor packaging a number of different electrical and thermal measurement setups have been developed. Passive electrical measurements are the most common and easiest measurements to perform as the package is tested without an active device inside. Active measurements involve measuring the package with an active device inside and can become problematic, especially when characterizing high power transistors with low output impedances, such as Si LDMOS transistors with output powers in excess of 30 Watts. This thesis deals with three main issues central to the problems encountered in modern high frequency MMIC packaging. Firstly, the development of new low-power low cost packages utilising cutting edge materials such as liquid crystal polymer (LCP) to compete with the traditional ceramic substrate packages. Secondly, the development of new high power laminate based packages optimised for electrical and thermal characteristics. Finally, the development of passive and active measurement systems used to characterize the developed packages. The active measurement system is based on the load-pull concept to measure and characterise high power packaged transistors. This system is also capable of measuring the waveforms at the device reference plane, which enables the optimised design of Power Amplifiers (PAs) ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAn {{infrared}} absorption spectrometer named SPIRIT (SPectromètre InfraRouge In situ Toute altitude) {{has been built}} for airborne simultaneous online measurements of trace gases. SPIRIT is based on two recent technological advances, leading to optimal performances and miniaturization: continuous wave quantum cascade lasers (CW-QCL) operating near room temperature coupled to a new, patented, multipass optical cell (Robert, Appl. Optics, 2007). An essential electronic development allows the sequential use of three QCLs with the same single cell. With judicious selected spectral micro-windows, this potentially leads to the measurements of at least four species at 0. 7 Hz frequency. The first deployment of SPIRIT was made onboard the DLR Falcon- 20 aircraft during the campaign associated to the EU SHIVA (Stratospheric Ozone: Halogen Impacts in a Varying Atmosphere) project in Nov. -Dec. 2011 over Malaysia. In the present paper, the flight of 19 Nov. is presented in detail {{as an example of}} the SPIRIT performances, with CO, CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O as measured species. The aircraft crossed four times the anvil of a severe thunderstorm from 11. 3 km to 12. 8 km altitude corresponding to a large convective system near Borneo island (6. 0 °N- 115. 5 °E). During the crossing, carbon monoxide mixing ratios increase by 5 to 10 ppbv <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>ambient</b> cloud free <b>environment</b> to the anvil cloud correlated with an increase of CH 4 mixing ratio.
