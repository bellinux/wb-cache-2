This provides support for defining immutable entities and is useful in allowing ADT-style specifications of values to be given in Eiffel. An abstract semantics is given for <b>expanded</b> <b>types</b> in terms of order sorted first order predicate logic; this is less restrictive than the existing operational semantics, and allows value types to be identified directly with <b>expanded</b> <b>types.</b> An operational semantics, which is closer in spirit to the abstract semantics than the existing Eiffel semantics, is outlined.

40|$|Acute Myeloid leukemia (AML) is an {{aggressive}} haematological malignancy that mainly affects the elderly. Relapse is common and {{is thought to}} be due to the presence of chemotherapy resistant leukemic stem cells (LSC). Within the CD 34 + disease (> 5 % of the blast cells expressing CD 34), two subtypes have been identified; an LMPP/GMPlike <b>expanded</b> <b>type</b> and a MPP/CMP-like <b>expanded</b> <b>type,</b> the former is the most common, accounting for around 80 % of CD 34 + AML. Both the GMP-like and LMPPlike expanded populations show LSC activity. To improve our understanding of the disease and gain better insight in to how to develop treatments, the molecular basis of the disease needs to be investigated. I investigated miRNAs in the GMP/LMPP-like expanded AML. miRNAs are small non-coding RNAs involved in the regulation of mRNA. In recent years miRNAs {{have been shown to be}} implicated in many different diseases. To investigate the role miRNAs play in AML, miRNA expression was profiled in leukemic and normal bone marrow. Bioinformatic analysis was then used to examine the different miRNA expression profiles between normal and leukemic marrow. Our study showed that miRNAs are dysregulated in AML. miRNAs from the miR- 17 - 92 and its paralogous cluster miR- 106 b- 92 were amongst the miRNAs to be found down regulated in AML As had been seen previously at an mRNA level, on an miRNA level the LSC populations more closely resembled more mature progenitor populations than HSC and MPP populations, however the LSC populations did display an aberrant stem cell-like miRNA signature.

We show that every controllable behavior over Zpr admits a p-image representation H(z) whose columns form a reduced p-basis in Zn pr[z] and such that the columns of H(0) form a p-basis in Zn pr and use such p-image representation to determine a minimal state diagram representation for our case...|$|E

40|$|The {{notion of}} hyperdecidability has been {{introduced}} by the first author {{as a tool to}} prove decidability of semidirect products of pseudovarieties of semigroups. In this paper we consider some stronger notions which lead to improved decidability results allowing us in turn to establish the decidability of some iterated semidirect products. Roughly speaking, the decidability of a semidirect product follows from a mild, commonly verified property of the first factor plus the stronger property for all the other factors. A key role in this study is played by intermediate free semigroups (relatively free objects of <b>expanded</b> <b>type</b> lying between relatively free and relatively free profinite objects). As an application of the main results, the decidability of the KrohnRhodes (group) complexity is shown to follow from non-algorithmic abstract properties likely to be satisfied by the pseudovariety of all finite aperiodic semigroups, thereby suggesting a new approach to answer (affirmativ [...] ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{monolayer}} {{behavior of}} PMMA of varying tacticities at the air-water interface was studied. A difference in lateral cohesive energy is argued {{to be responsible}} {{for the fact that the}} pressure area isotherms of isotactic PMMA deviate strongly from those of syndiotactic PMMA. At low surface pressures the isotactic PMMA monolayer can be characterized as an <b>expanded</b> <b>type</b> monolayer, whereas syndiotactic PMMA forms a condensed type monolayer. At areas of about 20 AZ/monomeric unit a transition can be observed in the pressure-area isotherm of isotactic PMMA. This transition was studied as a function of molecular weight, temperature, and compression speed. From the results it is deduced that the transition corresponds to a two-dimensional pseudocrystallization process in which the isotactic PMMA assumes a double-helix conformation in the monolayer, similar to the three-dimensional crystal structure. From an Avrami analysis it is inferred that the kinetics of this crystallization can be described by an activated nucleation, followed by a one-dimensional growth...|$|E

40|$|A {{notion of}} object {{ownership}} is introduced {{as a solution}} to difficult problems of specifying and reasoning about complex linked structures and of modeling aggregates (composite objects). Syntax and semantics are provided for extending Eiffel with language support for object ownership annotation and checking. The ideas also apply to other OOPLs such as C++. 1. Overview In section 2, we analyse the requirements of a mechanism for implementing the components of an aggregation or composite object, and we evaluate {{the extent to which the}} techniques of inheritance, <b>expanded</b> <b>type</b> attributes, reference type attributes and selective export satisfy these requirements. We restrict consideration to examples of composite objects from the solution (programming) domain. In section 3, we propose the use of reference type attributes with ownership properties to implement components and propose a syntax and semantics for object ownership. Section 4 shows how object ownership can be used in the natural modelling of aggregation structures identified in the problem domain.

Bulk density determined by solid displacement and true density determined by pycnometry yielded porosity measurement s o f 0. 9 for bread and 0. 6 for cookies. Percentage closed pore volume calculated {{by comparing the}} true density of porous samples of bread and cookies with the true density of !heir compacted pellet s showed that both bread and cookies contained closed pores. Pore size distributions representative of the mercury porosimetry range (pores less than 200 um in diameter) indicated that the smallest pore diameter was 6 um for both bread and cookies. Pore size distributions obtained corresponded to about 16 % and 65 % of the total pore volume in bread and cookies, respectively.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} minimality of encoders {{for basic}} convolutional codes over Zpr {{by using a}} recently developed concept of row reducedness for polynomial matrices over Zpr. It is known in the literature that the McMillan degree of a basic encoder is an upper bound for the minimum number of trellis states, but a general expression is missing. This open problem is solved in this paper. An <b>expanded</b> <b>type</b> of polynomial encoder is introduced, called “p-encoder”, whose rows are required to be a p-generator sequence. The latter property enables the working of fundamental linear algebraic properties, such as linear independence. It is shown that for any basic convolutional code {{a particular type of}} p-encoder can be constructed that is the ring analog of a canonical encoder from the field case. The open problem of constructing a minimal trellis representation of the code is then solved and the minimum number of trellis states is expressed in terms of an algebraic degree invariant of the code. In the literature this problem was only solved for the restrictive case where the code admits a basic row reduced encoder. The obtained results hold for the classical set-up of left compact support convolutional codes. It is also shown how they are extended to finite support convolutional codes. ...|$|E
