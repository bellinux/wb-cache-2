5|$|However, by {{this point}} the Palace Gates Line was in severe decline. Passenger numbers had fallen greatly since {{the opening of the}} Piccadilly line, while freight usage dropped {{throughout}} the 1950s as a result of improved road haulage and <b>declining</b> <b>demand</b> for coal. The line was closed to passengers on 7 January 1963. With freight usage dwindling to a trickle following the ending of passenger services, the goods yard was closed on 7 December 1964. The site of the goods yard was used {{for the construction of a}} large apartment block known as The Sandlings, and Noel Park & Wood Green railway station was converted into commercial premises, before being demolished in the early 1970s to become the site of the eastern section of Wood Green Shopping City.|$|E

25|$|The early 1980s saw {{the country}} facing a {{difficult}} period {{of structural adjustment}} caused by <b>declining</b> <b>demand</b> for its traditional products, deteriorating economic performance, and neglected structural reform.

On his recommendation the company began to produce magnesium sulfate {{in order to reduce the}} losses. Magnesium sulfate was primarily intended for the export to the United Kingdom, where it was used as a drying agent in the textile industry. The new product and an improving market for potassium nitrate helped the company to overcome the financial crisis in 1870. In 1871 the potassium chloride factory in Staßfurt was closed. On October 1, 1875 the second son of Vorster, the chemist Fritz Vorster joined the company as technical director. After the death of the founder Julius Vorster on October 10, 1876, the new owners converted the company into a limited partnership (Kommanditgesellschaft).|$|E

[...] That year, as buildings were being built for the 1933 Century of Progress International Exposition, the Chicago Concert Band Association offered to organize a seventy-person concert band to give free summer concerts if the park commissioners would build a band shell that had electric lighting and dressing rooms. [...] Construction on the wood and fiber E. V. Buchsbaum design began on a budget of $12,500 ($ in today's dollars), and the opening of free concerts commenced on August 24, 1931.

2500|$|The {{global market}} for {{acetaldehyde}} is <b>declining.</b> <b>Demand</b> has been impacted {{by changes in}} the production of plasticizer alcohols, which has shifted because n-butyraldehyde is less often produced from acetaldehyde, instead being generated by hydroformylation of propylene. [...] Likewise, acetic acid, once produced from acetaldehyde, is made predominantly by the lower-cost methanol carbonylation process. The impact on demand has led to increase in prices and thus slowdown in the market.|$|E
