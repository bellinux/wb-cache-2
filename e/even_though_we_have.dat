500|$|In February 2010, Bernd Schuster {{was asked}} if Raúl did not favour Villa moving to Real Madrid, to which he responded, [...] "I have a cough," [...] which caused many {{to believe that he}} was {{implying}} the rumour to be true. Villa firmly ridiculed that idea by saying, [...] "It is impossible that a player with as much class on and off the pitch as Raúl would speak poorly of me. I have always had a good relationship with Raúl, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> hardly met on international duty." [...] Speaking about Raúl's record with the Spanish national team as the nation's leading top scorer, Villa said, [...] "I've got 25 goals but he's got 44 and is still playing. I'd be delighted to reach that tally as I'd help the national team achieve great victories and, in many years' time, I could see my name on a [...] that another young lad was trying to beat. That would be great." [...] On 25 March 2011, two years after making that remark, Villa surpassed Raúl as Spain's all-time top scorer.|$|E
500|$|In July 2011, Lindelof {{said that}} the film would rely upon {{practical}} effects, and would use CGI generally for on-set pre-visualization of external space visuals. Scott said that [...] "you can pretty much do anything you want" [...] with digital technology, and, [...] "Doug Trumbull {{once said to me}} 'If you can do it live, do it live.' That was 29 years ago. <b>Even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> remarkable digital capabilities I still say do it live. It's cheaper." [...] Cinematographer Dariusz Wolski convinced Scott that {{it would be possible to}} film in 3D with the same ease and efficiency of 2D filming. 3D company 3ality Technica provided some of the rigs and equipment to facilitate 3D filming, and trained the film's crew in their proper operation. According to Scott, the decision to film in 3D added $10 million to the film's budget. Since 3D films need high lighting levels on set, the hallmark dark and shadowy atmosphere of the Alien films was added in post-production using color grading processes, and the 3D equipment was based on post-Avatar technology.|$|E

2500|$|In Now You See It: How the Brain Science of Attention Will Transform the Way We Live, Work, and Learn, Cathy Davidson {{suggests}} that breakthroughs in cognitive science should recalibrate {{our sense of}} what it means to learn. According to Davidson, those of us in higher education are paradoxically obsessed with the implications of living in the [...] "digital age," [...] <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> “yet to rethink how we need to be organizing our institutions—our schools, our offices—to maximize the opportunities of our digital era” (12). We tend to uphold models of teaching and assessments that no longer serve a generation of students who face a myriad of new challenges, as they attempt to learn to think critically in an era of information overload. Technology in all its forms is playing an increasingly important role in the lives of students. Colleges and universities, therefore, need to pay attention to the impact that the appropriate uses of digital tools can have on extending, enhancing, and enriching the student learning experience, both on and off campus. Moreover, and more importantly, Davidson argues that sustained exposure to such a range of digital media demands a different kind of attention than we previously required.|$|E

And this made me very melancholy sometimes, in reflecting, as the several occasions presented, how mean a use we make of all these, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> these powers enlightened by the great lamp of instruction, the Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of his word, added to our understanding; and why it has pleased God to hide the life saving knowledge from so many millions of souls, who, if I might judge by this poor savage, would make a much better use of it than we did.|$|E

From hence I sometimes was led too far, to invade the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of so arbitrary a disposition of things, that should hide that sight from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from both; but I shut it up, and checked my thoughts with this conclusion: first, that we did not know by what light and law these should be condemned; but that as God was necessarily, and by the nature of His being, infinitely holy and just, so it could not be, but if these creatures were all sentenced to absence from Himself, it was on account of sinning against that light which, as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves, and by such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the foundation was not discovered to us; and secondly, that still as we all are the clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could say to him, “Why hast thou formed me thus?” ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{there was}} no {{occasion}} for this precaution; for surely never master had a more sincere, faithful, and loving servant, than Friday proved to me. Without passion, sullenness, or design, perfectly obliging and engaging, his affections were as much tied to me, as those of a child to its parents; & I might venture to say, he would have sacrificed his life for the saving mine, upon any occasion whatsoever. And indeed the many testimonies he gave me of this, sufficiently convinced me that I had no occasion to use these precautions. And here I could not but reflect with great wonder, that however it hath pleased the Almighty in his providence, and {{in the government of}} the creation, to take from so great {{a part of the world}} of his creatures, the noblest uses to which their faculties, and the powers of their souls are adapted; yet that he has bestowed upon them the same reason, affections, sentiments of kindness and obligation, passions of resentment, sincerity, fidelity, and all the capacities of doing and receiving good that he has given us; and that when he is graciously pleased to offer them occasions of exerting these, they are as ready, nay, more ready, to apply them to the proper uses for which they were bestowed, than we often are. These thoughts would make me melancholy, especially when I considered how mean a use we make of all these, <b>even</b> <b>though</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> these powers enlightened by the Holy Spirit of God, and by the knowledge of this world, as an addition to our understanding; and why it has pleased the heavenly Wisdom to conceal the life saving knowledge from so many millions of souls who would certainly make a much better use of it than generally mankind do at this time. These reflections would sometimes lead me so far, as to invade the sovereignty of Providence, and, as it were, arraign the justice of such an arbitrary disposition of things, that should obscure that light from some, and reveal it to others, and yet expect a like duty from all. But I closed it up, checking my thoughts with this conclusion; first, That we were ignorant of that right and law by which those should be condemned; but as the Almighty was necessarily, and by the nature of his essence, infinitely just and holy; so it could not be otherwise, but that if these creatures were all destined to absence from himself, it was on account of sinning against that light, which, as the Scripture says, was a law to themselves and by such rules as their consciences would acknowledge to be just, though the first foundation was not discovered to us. And, secondly, That still as we were the clay in the hand of the potter, no vessel could thus say to him, Why hast thou fashioned me after this manner? ...|$|E
