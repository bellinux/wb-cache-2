40|$|Radiation {{therapy with}} protons and ions is gaining {{popularity}} {{all over the}} world, because of the physical and biological advances with respect to photon, electron and neutron radiotherapy. At present, sixty-four therapeutic centers worldwide use particle beams to treat their patients. Most of them use fast protons beams and ten centers (3 in Europe, 5 in Japan and 2 in China) use carbon ions. A definite model of radiation action on living cells is still unestablished, however {{it is known that}} the “quantity” of radiation, characterized by the absorbed dose (the mean <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> per unit mass) is not sufficient to characterize the biological effect, in that equal doses of different radiations lead to different results. Sparsely ionizing radiations, like gamma rays, are less effective than densely ionizing radiations, like slow protons and carbon ions; the capability of ionizing radiation to damage a living cell is indeed closely related to the local energy deposition within relevant subcellular structures, like the chromosomes. An accurate treatment planning should therefore take into account the particle interactions at the micrometer level. To this respect, microdosimetry offers a valuable technique, by measuring the stochastics of energy deposition in small volumes of approximately 1 m size. Tissue-equivalent gas proportional counters (TEPC) are the reference devices. A miniaturized TEPC has been build at the Legnaro National Laboratories of LNL, to cope with high intensity therapeutic beams used at the Centro Nazionale di Adroterapia Oncologica (CNAO) of Pavia. The objective of this thesis is to study in detail the working characteristics of this mini-TEPC, with the aim to design a novel simplified microdosimeter optimized for the clinical environment...|$|E
50|$|Particle accelerators are a {{well-developed}} {{technology used}} in scientific research for decades. They use electromagnetic fields to accelerate and direct charged particles along a predetermined path, and electrostatic “lenses” to focus these streams for collisions. The {{cathode ray tube}} in many twentieth-century televisions and computer monitors is a very simple type of particle accelerator. More powerful versions include synchrotrons and cyclotrons used in nuclear research. A particle-beam weapon is a weaponized version of this technology. It accelerates charged particles (in most cases electrons, positrons, protons, or ionized atoms, but very advanced versions can use other particles such as mercury nuclei) to near-light speed and then shoots them at a target. These particles have tremendous kinetic <b>energy</b> which they <b>impart</b> <b>to</b> <b>matter</b> in the target’s surface, inducing near-instantaneous and catastrophic superheating.|$|R

However, the thermal spike model can be an appropriate macroscopic model of the track registration of the materials in which excitons are self-trapped, because energy deposited to the material remains along the ion paths. The <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> <b>to</b> electron–hole pairs is diffused away from the ion paths in the materials in which excitons are not self-trapped. This explains the reason why the critical stopping power for track registration is higher in these materials.

The {{purposes of the}} investigation are to evaluate the performance of structures during various types of ground motion, and to attempt to identify more succinctly, than at present, {{the factors that influence}} structural deformation and damage. The investigation focuses on the total amount of <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> <b>to</b> a structure, the amount of energy dissipated in the structure by inelastic deformations and that dissipated by damping, the displacement ductility the structure experiences, and the number of yield excursions and reversals it goes through during the excitation. The effects of duration of ground motion on earthquake response also are investigated, and based on the amount of <b>energy</b> <b>imparted</b> <b>to</b> structures a possible effective motion criterion is defined. Two methods of scaling ground motion records for equal damage potential are examined. One {{is based on the assumption}} that equal displacement ductility will result in equal damage.

The inverse of the scale factors, derived above, may be used as reduction factors in order to modify elastic response spectra for design purposes.
