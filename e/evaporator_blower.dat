40|$|To {{evaluate}} an {{air-conditioning system}} performance on board {{of a car}} is quite cumbersome and tedious process due to the limitation of space in the engine compartment. This paper presents the process of designing and the result from the automotive refrigeration system simulation that have been integrated into the test rig. To perform the test on automotive refrigeration simulator the location for the temperature measurement selected and thermocouples were installed. The locations of the temperature probes are at the inlet and outlet of compressor, condenser outlet and the inlet of the evaporator. The gas pressure was measured at low and high pressure sides located at evaporator outlet and receiver-drier respectively. The test results were analyzed using the properties table of the refrigerant used. The coefficient of performance (COP), cooling load {{of the system and}} compressor power consumption were determined. The variable parameters used are the <b>evaporator</b> <b>blower</b> speed and the air velocity passes through the condenser. The experimental results obtained show that increasing the blower speed will reduce the COP of the refrigeration system. The maximum COP of the system is 4. 3 at the lowest <b>evaporator</b> <b>blower</b> speed. The power consumption will be reduced when the air flow velocity through the condenser is varied from 0 to 70 km/hr respectively...|$|E
40|$|In {{most of the}} Automotive Air Conditioning Systems (AACSs) {{though the}} {{compressor}} is powered by the car engine, the <b>evaporator</b> <b>blower</b> and the condenser fan are run by an alternator. Further, this alternator is powered from engine shaft. If there is any fault in the alternator that must drop the output voltage. This variation in output voltage can be achieved from a car battery by regulating its charging current. Owing to this, a stationary test rig for an AACS is developed with all actual automotive components coupled {{with a large number}} of sensors and additional accessories. However, the present investigation is restricted only to its air conditioning system, the alternator is replaced by a 12 volt lead acid car battery (capacity: 36 Ah) to invigorate the maneuvering of compressor clutch engagement and disengagement as well, empowerment of the prime movers. Now, a continuous monitoring of the system performance is done at different battery charge level. A DC power source is used to keep the battery voltage constant in different levels by varying the charging current. Further, in each battery charge level tests are conducted at three different blower speeds by regulating the existing toggle switch of the automobile. It is observed that the <b>evaporator</b> <b>blower</b> and the condenser fan speeds reduces continuously with the discharging of the storage battery, resulting a certain drop in air flow rate across the heat exchangers. Hence, the discharge pressure and the temperature increases due to lack of proper cooling across the condenser. Here, the continuous monitoring of the battery discharge voltage {{and its impact on the}} deterioration on the system cooling capacity, compression work and the COP are reported...|$|E
40|$|Whilst air {{conditioning}} systems increase thermal comfortableness in vehicles, they also raise the energy consumption of vehicles. Achieving thermal comfort in an energy-efficient way is a difficult task requiring good coordination between engine and the {{air conditioning}} system. This paper presents a coordinated energy management system to reduce the energy consumption of the vehicle air conditioning system while maintaining the thermal comfortableness. The system coordinates and manages the operation of <b>evaporator,</b> <b>blower,</b> and fresh air and recirculation gates to provide the desired comfort temperature and indoor air quality, under the various ambient and vehicle conditions, the energy consumption can then be optimized. Three simulations of the developed coordinated energy management system are performed to demonstrate its energy saving capacity. <br /...|$|E

40|$|Many {{air-conditioning}} (AC) {{systems are}} designed to operate at maximum cooling capacity regardless {{of the variation in}} the daily cooling load. At low loads, the conditions can be uncomfortably cold and the overcooling is an unnecessary waste of energy. To address these two issues, a multiple refrigeration circuit concept is proposed and applied to a roof-top bus AC system. A two-circuit model is proposed for a standard bus size in which each circuit has two evaporators of equal sizes arranged in parallel and installed on each passenger row, respectively. This means that each passenger row is served by two different evaporators sharing a common heat exchanger box. Depending on the cooling load, this concept allows one or both circuits (compressor motors) to be switched on and during either modes, it also allows one or more sets of <b>evaporator</b> <b>blowers</b> to be switched on. A steady-state computer model has been developed to simulate the performance of the proposed two-circuit AC system. A two-circuit air conditioner is also designed to form a roof-top bus AC system, fabricated, and installed on to an experimental rig. The experimental data are used to validate the computer model. The validation is on the system thermal performance and on the evaporator air outlet conditions (dry bulb temperature and relative humidity) at different modes of system operation, either at full or partial cooling loads. The simulated results gave satisfactory agreement with those obtained from the experimental work. Maximum absolute deviations are within the range of 19. 3 per cent, although most of the simulated results are less than a 10 per cent range from the experimental ones, which validates the computer program. The paper describes the modelling work carried out and the results obtained are presented in comparison with the experimental data...|$|R

40|$|A {{proof-of-concept}} 70 W Internal Reforming Methanol Fuel Cell (IRMFC) stack including Balance-of-Plant (BoP) was designed, {{assembled and}} tested. Advent TPS® high-temperature, polymer electrolyte membrane electrode assemblies were employed for fuel cell operation at 200 °C. In {{order to avoid}} phosphoric acid poisoning of the reformer, the anode electrocatalyst of each cell was indirectly adjoined, via a separation plate, to a highly active CuMnAlOx catalyst coated onto copper foam, which served as methanol reforming layer. The reformer was in-situ converting the methanol/steam feed to the required hydrogen (internal reforming concept) at 200 °C, which was readily oxidized at the anode electrodes. The operation of the IRMFC was supported {{through a number of}} BoP components consisting of a start-up subsystem (air <b>blower,</b> <b>evaporator</b> and monolithic burner), a combined afterburner/evaporator device, methanol/water supply and data acquisition units (reactants/products analysis, temperature control, flow control, system load/output control).
