40|$|Due to high-mud {{content in}} superfine {{unclassified}} tailings (SUT), the viscosity of cemented paste backfill (CPB) {{is high and}} its pipeline transportation properties are poor. Foaming technology was introduced to prepare a new three-phase flow backfill (TFB) using a <b>foaming</b> <b>machine.</b> Then the rheological parameters of TFB with different bubble ratio were measured and their pipeline transportation properties were simulated by Fluent. Besides, the simulation results were further verified by a semi-industrial loop test. The {{results indicate that the}} optimum ratio of TFB is a cement-sand ratio of 1 [*]:[*] 8, mass concentration of 70 %, and bubble ratio of 20 %. Compared with CPB, the decrease of bleeding rate, viscosity, and resistance loss of TFB is 27 %, 25 %, and 30 %, respectively. Therefore, foaming technology is an innovative and feasible solution for high-mud CPB in reducing viscosity, decreasing resistance loss, and improving pipeline transporting efficiency...|$|E

With the constant {{development in the}} fields of Greenness, Environmental Protection and Energy Conservation all over the world, the improvement of foam cement technology is to bring about a revolution in the architectural material industry. The main component of the cement <b>foaming</b> <b>machine</b> is the delivery pump system, in which the peristaltic pump is the most important part. In this thesis, on the bases of study of peristaltic pump in imported machines, mathematical models are made and an approximate calculation of flow rate of the peristaltic pump is given through exhaustive analyses of the structure and the changes in the cross section before and after compression rolling. This research will also make it possible to analyze the pressure in the exit of the pump and deduce the power needed by the driven peristaltic pump according to the factors like the calculation of on-way pressure loss with the consideration of working altitude. This research is expected to provide a theoretic principle for the development of cement foaming technology...|$|E

50|$|Protecting the bed {{of trucks}} {{has been around since}} the {{inception}} of the modern pick-up truck in the early 50's with simple modifications being made such as installing planks of wood to the beds. Ford's F100 series featured such options, although now done only for cosmetic purposes or restoration. People have also been known to install a simple sheet of wood as a means to protect the floor from being scratched or dented. As pick-up trucks were designed to haul cargo a more advanced method was created. Thermoforming, a technique that has been around since the 1940s in acrylics and styrene would eventually through advances in development and research create the first plastic drop-in bedliner in 1983 by Penda Corporation. Also during that time another type of product was being utilized that would eventually make its way to the truck market. In 1983, Morgan Evans founder of Rhinolinings in Johannesburg, South Africa initially used a urethane product applying it to rail cars and delivery vehicles, was the first to create a spray applied product for vehicle protection. Then during 1986, Charles Hibberd a Johannesburg native immigrated to Santa Fe, California bringing chemicals and crude equipment, set up shop and was the first to introduce the spray-on bedliner to the US. Shortly after Charles Hibberd's arrival to the U.S. another South African native would follow. In 1987, Russell Lewis, founder of Rhinolinings Corporation and fellow Johannesburg resident had also started doing bedliners in southern California inspired by Charles Hibberd, though his company would become the household standard of the industry. Hibberd's company known today as Arma International, INC. originally named Arma Linings eventually transpired into Arma Coatings after realizing the uses of the material outside the truck market is also the creator of the high pressure spray-on bedliner introduced in 1991.

40|$|Hot-wire cutting is {{a common}} {{material}} removal process used to shape and sculpt plastic foam materials, such as expanded polystyrene (EPS). Due to the low cost and sculpt-ability of plastic foams they are popular materials for large sized (> 1 m³) prototypes and bespoke visual artefacts. Recent developments in robotic <b>foam</b> sculpting <b>machines</b> have greatly increased the ability of hot-tools to sculpt complex geometrical surfaces bringing the subject {{into the realm of}} subtractive rapid prototyping/manufacturing. Nevertheless foam cut objects are not being exploited to their full potential due to the common perception that hot-wires are a low accuracy cutting tool. If greater accuracy for hot-wires can be obtained, it could provide a low cost method of producing high value functional engineering parts. Polystyrene patterns for lost foam casting are one such possibility. A nonlinear transient thermal finite element model was developed with the purpose of predicting the kerf width of hot-wire cut foams. Accurate predictions of the kerfwidth during cutting will allow the tool paths to be corrected off-line at the tool definition stage of the CAM process. Finite element analysis software (ANSYS) was used to simulate the hot-wire plastic foam cutting. The material property models were compiled from experimental data and commonly accepted values found in literature. The simulations showed good agreement with the experimental data and thus the model is thought to be reliable. The simulations provide an effective method of predicting kerf widths, under steady state cutting conditions. Limitations and further developments to the model are described...|$|R

40|$|Development of <b>foam</b> cutting <b>machines</b> {{for rapid}} {{prototyping}} and manufacturing purposes began {{shortly after the}} first additive manufacturing machines became commercialised in the late 1980 s. Increased computer power, the development and adoption of CAD/CAM software and rising demand for customisation has caused the rapid prototyping industry to grow swiftly in recent decades. While conventional rapid prototyping technologies are continuing to improve in speed and accuracy the ability to produce large (> 1 m³) prototypes, moulds or parts it is still expensive, time consuming and often impossible. Foam cutting rapid prototyping and manufacturing machines are ideally suited to fulfil this niche because of their high speed, large working volumes and inexpensive working materials. Few foam cutting rapid prototyping machines have been commercialised to-date leaving significant opportunities {{for research and development}} in this area. Thermal plastic foam cutting is the material removal process most commonly used in foam cutting rapid prototyping to shape or sculpt the plastic foam into desired shapes and sizes. The process is achieved by introducing a heat source (generally a wire or ribbon) which alters the physical properties of the plastic foam and allows low cutting forces to be achieved. In thermal plastic foam cutting the heat source is generated via Joule (electrical) heating. This study investigates the plastic foam cutting process using experimental cutting trials and finite element analysis. The first part of this thesis presents an introduction to conventional <b>foam</b> cutting <b>machines</b> and rapid prototyping machines. It is suggested that a market opportunity lies out of reach of both of these groups of machines. By combining attributes from each, foam cutting rapid prototyping machines can be developed to fill the gap. The second part of this thesis introduces the state-of-the-art in foam cutting rapid prototyping and investigates previous research into plastic foam cutting mechanics. The third part of this thesis describes cutting trials used to determine important factors which influence plastic foam cutting. Collectively over 800 individual cutting tests were made. The cutting trials included two main material sets, expanded polystyrene and extruded polystyrene, three different wire diameters, two hot-ribbon configurations and a wide range of feed rates and power inputs. For each cut the cutting force, wire temperature and kerf width was measured as well as observations of the surface texture. The data was then analysed and empirical relationships were identified. An excel spreadsheet is established which allows the calculation of important outcomes, such as kerf width, based on chosen inputs. Quantitative measurements of the surface roughness and form, of cuts made with hot-tools, will not be addressed in this thesis. This body of work is currently under investigation by a colleague within the FAST group. The fourth part of this thesis describes the formation of a nonlinear transient two-dimensional heat transfer finite element model, which is developed for plastic foam cutting simulations. The conclusion is that the cutting trials contributed {{to a better understanding of}} plastic foam cutting mechanics. A new parameter was identified called the mass specific effective heat input, which is a function of the foam material and the cutting tool, it allows the prediction of cutting conditions with given cutting parameters and hence provides the necessary relationships needed for adaptive automated foam sculpting. Simulation results were validated by comparison with experimental data and provide a strong base for further developments including optimisation processes with adaptive control for kerf width (cut error) minimization. This study has added considerably to the pool of knowledge for foam cutting with a hot-tool. In general, much of the work reported herein has not been previously published. This work provides the most advanced study of foam sculpting work available to date...|$|R
40|$|Bulk {{metallic}} glasses (BMGs), {{a class of}} amorphous metals defined as having a thickness greater than 1 mm, are being broadly investigated by NASA for use in spacecraft hardware. Their unique properties, attained from their non-crystalline structure, motivate several game-changing aerospace applications. BMGs have low melting temperatures {{so they can be}} cheaply and repeatedly cast into complex net shapes, such as mirrors or electronic casings. They are extremely strong and wear-resistant, which motivates their use in gears and bearings. Amorphous metal coatings are hard, corrosion-resistant, and have high reflectivity. BMG composites, reinforced with soft second phases, can be fabricated into energy-absorbing cellular panels for orbital debris shielding. One limitation of BMG materials is their inability to be welded, bonded, brazed, or fastened in a convenient method to form larger structures. Cellular structures (which can be classified as trusses, foams, honeycombs, egg boxes, etc.) are useful for many NASA, commercial, and military aerospace applications, including low-density paneling and shields. Although conventional cellular structures exhibit high specific strength, their porous structures make them challenging to fabricate. In particular, metal cellular structures are extremely difficult to fabricate due to their high processing temperatures. Aluminum honeycomb sandwich panels, for example, are used widely as spacecraft shields due to their low density and ease of fabrication, but suffer from low strength. A desirable metal cellular structure is one with high strength, combined with low density and simple fabrication. The thermoplastic joining process described here allows for the fabrication of monolithic BMG truss-like structures that are 90 % porous and have no heat-affected zone, weld, bond, or braze. This is accomplished by welding the nodes of stacked BMG composite panels using a localized capacitor discharge, forming a single monolithic structure. This removes many complicated and costly fabrication steps. Moreover, the cellular structures detailed in this work are among the highest- strength and most energy-absorbent materials known. This implies that a fabricated structure made from these materials would have unequaled mechanical properties compared to other metal foams or trusses. The process works by taking advantage of the electrical properties of the matrix material in the metal-matrix composite, which in this case is a metallic glass. Due to the random nanoscale arrangement of atoms (without any grain boundaries), the matrix glass exhibits a near-constant electrical resistivity as a function of temperature. By placing the composite panels between two copper electrode plates and discharging a capacitor, the entire matrix of the panel can be heated to approximately 700 C in 10 milliseconds, which is above the alloy s solidus but below the liquidus. By designing the geometry of the panels into the shape of an egg box, the electrical discharge localizes only in the tips of each pyramidal cell. By applying a forging load during discharge, the nodes of the panels can be fused together into a single piece, which then dissipates heat through radiation back into a glassy state. This means that two panels can be metallurgically fused into one panel with no heat-affected zone, creating a seamless connection between panels. During the process, the soft metal particles (dendrites) that are uniformly distributed in the glassy matrix to increase the toughness are completely unaffected by the thermoplastic joining. The novelty is that a truss (or foam-like) structure can be formed with excellent energy- absorbing capabilities without the need for machining. The technique allows for large-scale fabrication of panels, well-suited for spacecraft shields or military vehicle door panels. Crystalline metal cellular structures cannot be fabricated using the thermoplastic joining technique described here. If metal panels were te assembled into a cellular structure, they would either have to be welded, brazed, bonded, or fastened together, creating a weak spot in the structure at each connection. Welded parts require a welding material {{to be added to the}} joint and exhibit a soft and weak heat-affected zone. Brazing and bonding do not form a metallurgical joint and thus exhibit low strengths, especially when the panels are pulled apart and fasteners require high-stress-concentration holes to be drilled. No equivalent rapid heating method exists for assembling metal panels together into cellular structures, and thus, those parts must be <b>foamed,</b> <b>machined,</b> or investment cast if they are to form a monolithic structure. If the crystalline panels were to be joined using capacitive discharge, as with a spot welder, their bond would be very weak, and the panels would have to be extremely thin. In contrast, the strength of joined BMG parts has been demonstrated to have strength comparable to the parent material. This technique opens up the possibility of using large-scale BMG hardware in spacecraft, military, or commercial applications...|$|R
40|$|The NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) uses {{commercial}} waveguide {{windows on}} the output waveguide of Ka-band (32 GHz) low-noise amplifiers. Mechanical failure of these windows resulted in an unacceptable loss in tracking time. To address this issue, a new Ka-band WR- 28 waveguide window has been designed, fabricated, and tested. The window uses a slab of low-loss, low-dielectric constant foam that is bonded into a 1 / 2 -wave-thick waveguide/flange. The foam is a commercially available, rigid, closed-cell polymethacrylimide. It has excellent electrical properties with a dielectric constant of 1. 04, and a loss tangent of 0. 01. It is relatively strong with a tensile strength of 1 MPa. The material is virtually impermeable to helium. The finished window exhibits a leak rate of less than 3 x 10 (exp - 3) cu cm/s with helium. The material is also chemically resistant and can be cleaned with acetone. The window is constructed by fabricating a window body by brazing a short length of WR- 28 copper waveguide into a standard rectangular flange, and machining the resulting part to a thickness of 4. 6 mm. The <b>foam</b> is <b>machined</b> to a rectangular shape with a dimension of 7. 06 x 3. 53 mm. The foam is bonded into the body with a two-part epoxy. After curing, the excess glue and foam are knife-trimmed by hand. The finished window has a loss of less than 0. 08 dB (2 %) and a return loss of greater than 25 dB at 32 GHz. This meets the requirements for the DSN application. The window is usable for most applications over the entire 26 -to- 40 -GHz waveguide band. The window return loss can be tuned to a required frequency by var y in g {{the thickness of the}} window slightly. Most standard waveguide windows use a thin membrane of material bonded into a recess in a waveguide flange, or sandwiched between two flanges with a polymer seal. Designs using the recessed window are prone to mechanical failure over time due to constraints on the dimensions of the recess that allow the bond to fail. Designs using the sandwich method are often permeable to helium, which prohibits the use of helium leak detection. At the time of this reporting, 40 windows have been produced. Twelve are in operation with a combined operating time of over 30, 000 hours without a failure...|$|R
