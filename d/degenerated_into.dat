5|$|During December 12, Wasa {{passed through}} the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed {{directly}} over Tubuai, before it <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression later that day. However, gale-force winds remained associated with the depression, before the system turned towards the east-northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotu Islands. During December 14, Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons. During that day the system gradually intensified before it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95km/h (60mph). During December 15, the system maintained its peak intensity, as it moved through the uninhabited Acteon Group of islands, before during {{the next day it}} started to gradually weaken. Arthur <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a shallow depression during December 17, before it was last noted during the next day as it dissipated {{to the north of the}} Pitcairn islands.|$|E
5|$|A low {{pressure}} area that had developed over the northern Bay of Bengal the previous day concentrated into a depression early on June 29. The depression intensified as it moved to the northwest, becoming a deep depression shortly before it crossed the Orissa coast.

It <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a remnant low over central Uttar Pradesh during the evening on July 3.|$|E
5|$|A weak wave in the ITCZ {{organized}} into Tropical Depression Ten-E on August 30. It headed west-northwest and quickly intensified into {{a tropical storm}} and eventually, a hurricane. Hernan then began rapidly deepening, reaching Category5 intensity on September 1. It maintained that intensity for 12hours before tracking over cooler waters. The storm weakened steadily, with wind shear contributing to its deterioration. Hernan then <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a remnant low on September 6. The low turned to the southwest and dissipated three days later.|$|E

5|$|As Carlos moved inland, {{it turned}} to the {{northwest}} {{in response to the}} anticyclone over Mexico, and it quickly weakened to tropical depression status. By 12hours after landfall, there was little evidence of a circulation on satellite imagery.

The circulation {{turned to the}} southwest and emerged into the Pacific Ocean; by 0000UTC on June29, the system dissipated completely.|$|E
5|$|By August16, {{the forward}} motion of Ana began to increase, and the storm quickly entered {{a region of}} dry, stable air. By the afternoon, a Hurricane Hunter {{reconnaissance}} mission {{did not find any}} evidence of tropical storm-force winds, resulting in Ana being downgraded to a tropical depression. It was determined in post-storm analysis, that Ana had <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a tropical wave shortly afterwards, and was no longer a tropical cyclone. Several hours later, the system redeveloped convection as it raced towards the west-northwest at 26mph (42km/h). Early on August17, radar imagery from Guadeloupe and San Juan, Puerto Rico depicted a system without a closed, low-level circulation. Despite this, the NHC continued operational advisories until confirmation could be made with visible satellite imagery. Later that day, a final reconnaissance plane flew into the storm and did not find a low-level circulation. Following this, the NHC stated that Ana had dissipated off the coast of Puerto Rico, despite having already <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a tropical wave the previous day. The remnants of Ana were once more monitored for signs of regeneration, but land interaction with Hispaniola and Cuba spoiled the system's chances of redevelopment.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{moving over}} warm waters, Elida began to weaken because it began an eyewall {{replacement}} cycle. When the cycle ended, the cyclone was over cooler water and unsteadily weakened.

5|$|Hurricane Marty was a {{tropical}} cyclone that produced heavy rains and flooding {{in several states}} in Southwestern and Western Mexico. The twentieth named storm and twelfth hurricane of the annual hurricane season, Marty developed from {{a tropical}} wave on September26, 2015 to the southwest of Acapulco, Guerrero, in Mexico. Initially a tropical depression, the system strengthened into a tropical storm early on the following day. Due to favorable atmospheric conditions, Marty continued to intensify, but wind shear sharply increased as the storm approached a large mid- to upper-level trough. Despite this, the cyclone deepened further, becoming a hurricane on September28 and peaking with sustained winds of 80mph (130km/h) shortly thereafter. Wind shear quickly took its toll on the hurricane, weakening it to a tropical storm early on September29. About 24hours later, Marty <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a post-tropical low pressure area offshore Guerrero. The low further <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a trough later on September30, and eventually dissipated on October4.|$|E
5|$|On September28, {{a system}} {{developed}} into a tropical depression, simultaneously with Tropical Storm Monica.. It headed generally westward and on September29, 18 hours after Monica did it, strengthened into a tropical storm. Nanette continued out to sea and slowly strengthened. It peaked in windspeed of 50mph (85km/h) on October3 {{and turned to the}} southwest. It then slowly weakened. On October4, it weakened into a tropical depression and then <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a disturbance that same day. No damage or deaths were reported.|$|E

5|$|The {{interaction}} of two tropical waves and an upper-level trough {{led to the}} development of a tropical depression over the central Atlantic by 12:00UTC on August2. The depression steadily organized after formation, intensifying into Tropical Storm Colin by 06:00UTC on August3. An abnormally strong ridge to the storm's north steered Colin to the west-northwest; reaching a forward speed up to 30mph (50km/h), the system was unable to maintain a closed circulation and instead <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a trough by 18:00UTC that day. Over the coming days, the trough decelerated and recurved north into a weakness in the ridge while still producing tropical storm-force winds. Satellite imagery showed the reformation of a well-defined circulation by 12:00UTC on August5, and the system was once again classified as Tropical Storm Colin. After attaining peak winds of 60mph (95km/h), an approaching trough sheared the cyclone and turned it northeast. Colin weakened to a tropical depression by 00:00UTC on August8 and <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a trough for a second time twelve hours later; the trough dissipated early on August9.|$|E
5|$|The {{next day}} Jasmine entered {{an area of}} {{vertical}} wind shear, which consequently weakened the cyclone and caused its eye to expand. A high-pressure area south of Jasmine later steered the weakening cyclone to the northeast on 12February. Although it entered an area of warmer sea surface temperatures, Jasmine subsequently entered extratropical transition and later <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> an extratropical cyclone on 16February, and later dissipated completely on 19February.|$|E
5|$|The storm rapidly {{weakened}} as {{it continued}} northward, and <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a tropical depression by July 20. The weak depression moved through Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina, maintaining a well-defined cloud signature. Due to a front behind the system, Danny unusually strengthened to {{a tropical storm}} over North Carolina on July 24. This rare phenomenon occurred due to interaction with a developing trough and its associated baroclinic zone.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Depression Sixteen-E {{formed from}} a {{disturbance}} in the intertropical convergence zone. Despite being {{located in a}} hostile environment, it managed to organize into a tropical depression on November 14. It was briefly forecast to strengthen into a tropical storm. However, wind shear prevented that from occurring. Consequently, the depression <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a remnant low on November 16 and dissipated soon after that.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Ana was {{the first}} named storm of the 2009 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season and the first tropical cyclone to impact the Caribbean islands during 2009. Forming out of an {{area of low pressure}} associated with a tropical wave on August11, Ana briefly attained tropical storm intensity on August12 before weakening back to a depression. The following day, the system <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a non-convective remnant low as it tracked westward. On August14, the depression regenerated roughly 1,075mi (1,735km) east of the Leeward Islands. Early on August15, the storm re-attained tropical storm status, at which time it was named Ana. After reaching a peak intensity with winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a barometric pressure of 1003mbar (hPa; 29.65inHg), the storm began to weaken again due to increasing levels of wind shear and the unusually fast movement of Ana. In post-storm analysis, it was discovered that Ana had <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a tropical wave once more on August16, before reaching any landmasses.|$|E
5|$|A complex {{formation}} {{involving a}} tropical wave and a gale over the Gulf of Tehuantepec formed Tropical Depression One-E on May 24.

Its rate of intensification picked up, and Alma became a hurricane on May 28. Alma reached Category3 intensity on May 30. The hurricane began to weaken almost immediately thereafter under the influence of wind shear and cool water. Alma rapidly fell apart, and <b>degenerated</b> <b>into</b> a weak low pressure area by June 1.|$|E
