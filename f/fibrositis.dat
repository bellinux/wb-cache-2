5|$|During {{the first}} innings, Brown captained Australia while Bradman was absent with <b>fibrositis.</b> The {{tourists}} fell for 331, with debutants Sam Loxton and Doug Ring taking three wickets apiece. India eventually fell to another innings defeat, so Brown {{did not have}} another opportunity to score a Test century on home soil. His Test aggregate in Australia stood at 223 runs at only 33.86, in contrast to his away average of 1,369 runs at 50.70. His first-class batting average of 43.58 for the season was inferior to that of Barnes and Morris, both of whom averaged more than 50.|$|E
5|$|The Australian onslaught {{against the}} spinners {{prompted}} Yardley {{to take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his fast men. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and Yardley dropped him soon after. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes remaining, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker to the fence. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a <b>fibrositis</b> attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken during a delay for treatment, and Morris had to shield Bradman from the strike until the skipper’s pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea, with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a <b>fibrositis</b> attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|Bradman {{joined the}} Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. The RAAF had more {{recruits}} than it could equip and train and Bradman spent {{four months in}} Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, {{to act as a}} divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as <b>fibrositis.</b> Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight.|$|E
5|$|During the 1953 season, Australia toured England having {{held the}} Ashes since 1934 but critics {{considered}} England {{to have a}} good chance of winning the series. Hutton was retained as England captain initially on a match-by-match basis. His health was uncertain and he was troubled by <b>fibrositis</b> which restricted his movement and adversely affected his fielding. He top-scored in both England innings with 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test, and batted effectively for Yorkshire against the Australians. After dropping three catches in Australia's first innings in the second Test, Hutton scored 145 runs in his first innings. However, he was dismissed early in the second innings; England managed to draw the match, but Hutton faced press criticism for his cautious tactics. Rain prevented a result in the third Test, but Hutton scored 66 and his tactics were praised. After the match, he was confirmed as captain for the remainder of the series, and the forthcoming MCC winter tour of West Indies.|$|E
5|$|The onslaught {{prompted}} Yardley to {{take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Cranston's bowling, but sliced {{it in the air}} to point. Yardley dived forward and got his hands to the ball, but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202halfway to the required totalwith 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. England began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate. Bradman hooked two boundaries, but suffered a <b>fibrositis</b> attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken while Bradman was being treated, and Morris had to shield his captain from the strike until the pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|Hammond {{was posted}} to a {{training}} {{wing of the}} Royal Air Force (RAF) at Hastings in Sussex before he moved with his unit to Torquay. He had mainly administrative duties, including instructing recruits, for whom he made life hard. He played some games of cricket in 1940 for various teams before being posted to Cairo in December. His responsibilities in Egypt included organising, promoting and playing in cricket matches. Posted there until 1943, {{he was promoted to}} flight lieutenant and then to squadron leader. While Hammond may have helped to raise morale, Cairo was an easy posting during the war and he was not involved directly in combat. He also spent much time in South Africa, where he played cricket and was reunited with Sybil Ness-Harvey. At the beginning of 1944, Hammond was posted back to England, where he lectured and drilled cadets. Playing as captain in many one-day cricket matches, he was praised by Wisden for encouraging exciting contests. Others applauded his batting, including his hitting of many sixes, fitting the games' relaxed atmosphere. In December 1944, Hammond, suffering from <b>fibrositis,</b> was discharged from the RAFVR on health grounds and returned to work at Marsham Tyres. Once the war ended in Europe in May 1945, several first-class matches were organised. Hammond played in six, scoring 592 runs at an average of 59.20 with two centuries. In a match for an England team against the Dominions at Lord's, he made a century in each innings, becoming the first man to do this seven times.|$|E
5|$|Upon resumption, Morris {{severely}} attacked Compton, who {{had been}} bowling {{in an attempt to}} exploit the spin, aided by a series of full tosses and long hops that were easily dispatched for runs. This prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with pacemen. Australia reached 202, halfway to the required total, with 165 minutes left. When Bradman suffered a <b>fibrositis</b> attack, Morris had to shield him from the strike until it subsided. Morris passed his century, and was then given another life on 126 when Laker dropped him while fielding at square leg. Bradman was given another life at 108 when Evans missed a stumping opportunity. Australia reached tea at 288/1 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 167 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182, having partnered Bradman in a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. This brought Miller to the crease with 46 runs still required. He struck two boundaries and helped take the score to 396 before falling to Cranston with eight runs still needed. Harvey came in and got off the mark with a boundary that brought up the winning runs. Australia had won by seven wickets, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase, with Bradman unbeaten on 173 in only 255 minutes with 29 fours. The attendance of 158,000 was the highest for any cricket match on English soil and the takings were 34,000 pounds. The attendance remains a record for a Test in England.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the loss}} of the Sydney Test the Australians were still confident, they had won by an innings, England had won {{narrowly}} {{in the absence of the}} Australian captain Ian Johnson and the great all-rounder Keith Miller, who now returned to the team. Miller was playing despite the advice of his doctor who warned him not to bowl on his injured knee and said himself that he didn't think his back could take the strain of bowling. Len Maddocks replaced Gil Langley as wicket-keeper as the latter had been hit in the eye by a bail in a Sheffield Shield match. England received Denis Compton at the expense of Tom Graveney, but faced a crisis on the first day of the Test when Len Hutton refused to leave his bed because of his <b>fibrositis</b> and a heavy cold. The manager Geoffrey Howard, George Duckworth, Bill Edrich and Godfrey Evans had to persuade him to play so as to not damage the morale of the team, especially as the series was locked at 1–1. Finally Hutton agreed to play and went to the ground. The wicket was worse than Sydney. After the MCC's match against Victoria it had broken up completely had had to be repaired and was covered with cracks even before the Test began.|$|E
25|$|The MCC played New South Wales {{immediately}} before the Fifth Test and it rained, as {{in every other}} match on their tour. The ground staff ran on to cover the MCC-NSW wicket and left the Test wicket under the rain. As a result, it was over-watered and while not dangerous it favoured the bowlers and produced the best cricket of the series. Len Hutton was sent to hospital after being hit on the chin by a Ginty Lush bouncer in that match, but returned to make 40 and 74. Jack Fingleton called on Lindwall and Miller to not subject him to another fast bowling barrage, which could damage his weakened left arm and end his career. Wally Hammond had a crippling attack of <b>fibrositis</b> {{the day before the}} Test and was unable to turn without pain and reluctantly withdrew in favour of Norman Yardley. He remained in the dressing room and gave advice, but there was an improvement in the way England played on the field. Joe Hardstaff was also unfit and they were replaced by the popular Surrey opener Laurie Fishlock and the off-spinner Peter Smith, who had just taken a record 9/121 at the SCG. Sid Barnes returned to the Australian team after his illness and Merv Harvey was dropped, the batsman Ron Hamence replaced the injured Ian Johnson and George Tribe was preferred to Bruce Dooland. Yardley won the toss and chose to bat.|$|E
25|$|The {{tourists}} {{began the}} second Test with their confidence shaken. Hutton {{opted for a}} more balanced bowling attack; to include the spinners Bob Appleyard and Johnny Wardle, he left out Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, doubting that he was fit enough to play. Australia were also weakened by injuries for this Test, but his {{did not seem to}} matter when Hutton lost the toss, had to bat first and England collapsed to 154 in their first innings. Hutton batted over two hours for 30 in this innings and scored 28 in the second. However, in a low scoring match, Tyson proved to be the crucial factor and he bowled England to a 38 run win. After a break for Christmas, Hutton was unwell {{at the start of the}} third match in the series, suffering from <b>fibrositis</b> and a heavy cold. After deciding to play at the last minute, he again left out Bedser from the side, although he was fit to play. This was an unexpected decision. Hutton did not inform Bedser that he would not play before the match, and the bowler only learned of his fate when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match. Hutton scored 12 and 42, with the latter innings particularly valuable at a difficult time in the match. However, Peter May and Colin Cowdrey made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128 run victory in a match where no innings total reached 300.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to the war}} {{this was}} the first Test to be played in Australia since 3 March 1937 and there were eight Australian debutants; Ian Johnson, Ray Lindwall, Colin McCool, Keith Miller, Arthur Morris, Don Tallon, Ernie Toshack and George Tribe. However, Johnson, Lindwall, McCool, Miller, Tallon and Toshack had played in an Australia vs New Zealand match the {{previous}} season which was belatedly recognised as a Test, the only game between the two countries treated as such before 1973. As a result, only Morris and Tribe are now seen as debutants with vice-captain Lindsay Hassett having played only four Tests before the war and Sid Barnes one. Don Bradman made himself available for selection at the last moment against the advice of his doctor due to the severe attack of <b>fibrositis</b> during the war, an ailment from which the England captain Wally Hammond also suffered. There were no English debutants; Hammond, Len Hutton, Cyril Washbrook, Bill Edrich, Denis Compton, Paul Gibb, Bill Voce and Doug Wright were all pre-war players, vice-captain Norman Yardley had played one Test before the war and Alec Bedser and Jack Ikin had debuted against India in 1946. The vaunted England batting line up had done well so far on the tour, with Hutton making 522 runs (87.00), Washbrook 461 runs (51.22), Edrich 221 runs (44.20), Compton 423 runs (60.43) and Hammond 277 runs (55.40), but their bowling had been weakened by injuries. Gibbs was preferred as wicketkeeper over Godfrey Evans because of his batting form in South Africa in 1938-39. There had been a drought in Queensland since 1941 and the curator had tried boring for water without success. The Woolloongabba wicket, traditionally green and helpful to fast bowlers, was a dry, lifeless brown and good for runs. Bradman won the toss and had no difficulty in choosing to bat first.|$|E
500|$|In 1945–46, Bradman {{suffered}} regular {{bouts of}} <b>fibrositis</b> while {{coming to terms}} with increased administrative duties and the establishment of his business. He played for South Australia in two matches to help with the re-establishment of first-class cricket and later described his batting as [...] "painstaking". Batting against the Australian Services cricket team, Bradman scored 112 in less than two hours, yet Dick Whitington (playing for the Services) wrote, [...] "I have seen today the ghost of a once great cricketer". Bradman declined a tour of New Zealand and spent the winter of 1946 wondering whether he had played his last match. [...] "With the English team due to arrive for the 1946–47 Ashes series, the media and the public were anxious to know if Bradman would lead Australia." [...] His doctor recommended against a return to the game.|$|E
500|$|As a batsman, Hammond {{started the}} tour well, scoring 208 {{in an early}} game, but lost form once the Tests began. One of the turning points of the series was a disputed catch in the first Test. Bradman, who looked in poor form and {{uncertain}} to continue his cricket career for much longer, had reached 28 when the English team believed he had edged the ball to Jack Ikin at slip. Bradman, as was his entitlement, waited for the umpire's decision instead of leaving the field. The fielders were certain that he was out, but the umpire said he was not, believing the ball had bounced before it was caught; opinion among other participants and spectators was divided. However, Hammond was extremely angry, saying loudly, either to Bradman or the umpires, [...] "a fine fucking way to start a series". Afterwards, relations between Hammond and Bradman deteriorated {{and there was a}} coldness between them. Bradman went on to score 187 and Australia won the match and, ultimately, the series. In that first Test, Hammond played two good innings on a very difficult wicket, but in the series, he did not pass fifty, scoring 168 runs at an average of 21.00 before missing the final Test. In all first-class cricket, he scored 633 runs (average 45.21). He suffered increasing pain from <b>fibrositis</b> throughout the series, and later admitted that he felt close to a breakdown. Hammond played his last Test in New Zealand {{at the end of the}} tour, scoring 79 in his final innings. He ended his career with 7,249 Test runs at an average of 58.46. His 22 centuries remained an English record until surpassed by Alastair Cook in December 2012.|$|E
500|$|The Fourth Test at Headingley in Leeds saw Morris at his finest; England started {{well with}} 496 {{in the first}} innings and took a 38-run lead as Australia replied with 458, Morris {{contributing}} only six. England declared at 8/365, leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. At the time, {{this would have been}} the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach the target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favor the spin bowlers. Morris and Hassett started slowly, with only six runs in the first six overs. When Laker was introduced to exploit the spin, 13 runs were taken from his first over, but only 44 runs came in the first hour, leaving 360 runs needed in 285 minutes. Just 13 runs were added in the next 28 minutes before Hassett was dismissed. Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 257 minutes. Bradman signalled his intentions on his first ball by driving Laker against the spin for a boundary. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours off Len Hutton's bowling as Australia reached lunch at 1/121. Upon resumption, Morris severely attacked Denis Compton's bowling. Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called [...] "indescribably bad bowling". He reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in just over two hours. Morris had added 37 runs in the 15 minutes since lunch. He had become the first Australian to hit 20 boundaries in his reaching his century in a Test in England. This forced English captain Norman Yardley to replace Compton, and Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left. When Bradman suffered a <b>fibrositis</b> attack, Morris had to shield him from the strike until it subsided. Morris passed his century and Australia reached tea at 1/288 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 167 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed for 182, having survived multiple chances and partnered Bradman in a partnership of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia proceeded to accumulate the remaining 46 runs to secure the victory by seven wickets.|$|E
500|$|Expectations {{before the}} Australian tour were low after the {{confusion}} of the 1954 summer and some controversial selections. Trueman, Jim Laker and Tony Lock, part of the winning 1953 team, were omitted; Colin Cowdrey and Vic Wilson were included. Hutton further downplayed his team's chances through exaggerating its inexperience to the Australian press; newspapers were already sympathetic to Hutton as a professional captain of a class-driven country. The team began the tour well. Hutton {{made a series of}} good scores in the opening games. But for the first Test, Hutton did not include a spinner in the team and chose to bowl on winning the toss, an unusual strategy in Australia. The home side scored 601, England dropped 12 catches and, with the key players Evans and Compton injured, lost by an innings; the press blamed Hutton for choosing to bowl. Despite the result, Hutton saw potential in Frank Tyson's bowling and arranged for Alf Gover, a respected coach who was in Australia as a journalist, to improve and shorten Tyson's run to the wicket. For the second Test, Hutton left out the unfit Alec Bedser, England's most reliable bowler since the war, to include two spinners, but in a low-scoring game, Tyson made the difference and England won by 38 runs. Hutton was unwell before the third Test, suffering from <b>fibrositis</b> and a heavy cold, and had to be persuaded out of bed by members of his team. He decided to play at the last minute and unexpectedly left out Bedser again, although he was fit to play. Hutton neglected to inform Bedser, who only learned of his omission when he saw the team list displayed in the dressing room before the match. Hutton contributed few runs, but Cowdrey and Peter May made large scores and Tyson took seven wickets as Australia were bowled out for 111 in their second innings, giving England a 128-run victory. The fourth Test was crucial, and Hutton's innings of 80 runs in four-and-a-half hours was the highest of the game. Wisden believed Hutton's tactics were instrumental in giving his team the upper hand, and in the final innings, England needed 94 to win and retain the Ashes. Early wickets, including Hutton's, fell to Miller, and when the captain returned to the dressing room, he said that Miller had [...] "done us again." [...] Compton, the next man in, replied [...] "I haven't been in yet", and stayed at the wicket until the match was won by five wickets. Many commentators viewed this as a sign that Hutton's reserve had slipped in the critical situation, but Alan Gibson believes it was a deliberate ploy to inspire Compton. England went on to draw the final Test in a match ruined by rain. Hutton was out to the fourth ball of the match, but Australia were forced to follow on for the first time by England since 1938, and Hutton took a wicket with the last ball of the match before time ran out. This ended the series, which England won 3–1.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{season in}} 1949–50, the Australians headed to South Africa [...] for a five Test tour. Lindwall's partnership with Miller was broken {{up when the}} latter was omitted from the touring squad. Miller stated that he wished to be considered only as a batsman and his omission caused great controversy. In any case, Miller was drafted in as cover after Johnston {{was involved in a}} car accident {{at the start of the}} tour, although both went on to play in all five Tests. Lindwall started the tour on a poor note in the First Test at Wanderers in Johannesburg, scoring 21 and then going wicketless as Australia completed an innings victory. It was the first time that Lindwall had failed to take a wicket in both innings of a Test. His wicketless run persisted until the second innings of the Second Test in Cape Town, where he took 5/32 after the hosts had been forced to follow on, as Australia completed another easy victory. Lindwall then took match figures of 4/54 as Australia completed a hat-trick of victories at Durban. Lindwall took 3/82 in South Africa's only innings in the Fourth Test at Johannesburg, but was dropped for the Fifth Test, something that surprised cricket commentators. His tour had been intermittently interrupted by groin problems, <b>fibrositis</b> and a stomach disorder, and his 12 wickets at an average of 20.66 at three wickets per match was below his customary rate. Overall, when fit, he was effective, with 50 wickets at 14.58. Lindwall forced his way back into the XI for the First Test of the 1950-51 Ashes series against Freddie Brown's England team. Australia struggled to 228 in its first innings with Lindwall making the second top-score of 41 in supporting Neil Harvey (74) in a rearguard action. Lindwall was not required as Miller and Johnston's medium pace reduced England to 7/68 on a sticky wicket before Brown declared, forcing the Australian to bat on the unfavourable pitch. Australia then declared at 7/32. Lindwall yorked Reg Simpson first ball and Australia seized the initiative, reducing England to 6/30 before bowling them out for 122 to take the match by 70 runs. Lindwall took five wickets in the Second Test in Melbourne, two of which came in the closing stages of the English run-chase. Chasing 178, England lost Brown and Evans in consecutive overs to the second new ball and ended 28 runs short of victory. Australia went on seal the series with an innings victory in the Third Test in Sydney – Lindwall bowled Brown and Bedser before breaking Trevor Bailey's thumb in the first innings to help Australia seize control. In the Fourth Test in Adelaide, Lindwall took 3/51 in England's first innings before scoring a patient 31 in Australia's second innings, helping to set up at target that was 274 runs too much for Brown's men. The Fifth and final Test of the summer was to be the first Test defeat for Lindwall in the first 24 Tests of his career. Despite taking 3/77 in the first innings to complement the four wickets of Miller – the most in an innings by the pair during the series – England took their first win over Australia since 1938. Lindwall had taken 15 wickets at 22.93 for the series.|$|E
2500|$|Historical {{perspectives}} {{on the development of}} the fibromyalgia concept note the [...] "central importance" [...] of a 1977 paper by Smythe and Moldofsky on <b>fibrositis.</b> The first clinical, controlled study of the characteristics of fibromyalgia syndrome was published in 1981, providing support for symptom associations. In 1984, an interconnection between fibromyalgia syndrome and other similar conditions was proposed, and in 1986, trials of the first proposed medications for fibromyalgia were published.|$|E
2500|$|Chronic {{widespread}} pain {{had already}} been described in the literature in the 19th century but the term fibromyalgia was not used until 1976 when Dr P.K. Hench used it to describe these symptoms. Many names, including [...] "muscular rheumatism", [...] "fibrositis", [...] "psychogenic rheumatism", and [...] "neurasthenia" [...] were applied historically to symptoms resembling those of fibromyalgia. The term fibromyalgia was coined by researcher Mohammed Yunus as a synonym for <b>fibrositis</b> and was first used in a scientific publication in 1981. Fibromyalgia is from the Latin fibra (fiber) and the Greek words myo (muscle) and algos (pain).|$|E
2500|$|The {{status of}} the match {{at the time was}} uncertain, and the game was not {{recognised}} as an official Test until March 1948. Instead of the usual baggy greens, the Australians wore caps and blazers marked [...] "ABC" [...] (for [...] "Australian Board of Control"). Both teams included several debutants—of the twenty-two players in the match, thirteen were making their debut. Australia's best batsman and usual captain Don Bradman declined to tour, having suffered from regular bouts of <b>fibrositis.</b> Queensland batsman Bill Brown was selected as captain in his place, although Lindsay Hassett had also been suggested for the position. New Zealand was skippered by Otago batsman Walter Hadlee, with pre-war captain Curly Page having retired. Australia included seven debutants for the Test, many of whom would go on to play large roles for the national side in later tours, including during the 1948 [...] "Invincibles" [...] tour. The match was also Bill O'Reilly's last at Test level.|$|E
2500|$|Bradman {{volunteered for}} the RAAF in 1940, but {{transferred}} to the Australian Army as a lieutenant in the Army School of Physical Training. Stress and depression aggravated his <b>fibrositis</b> and he was invalided out of the army in 1941, after which he spent months in poor physical condition and lost {{the use of his}} right thumb and forefinger. He resumed stockbroking in 1942 and set up his own firm after his employer was imprisoned for fraud and embezzlement. In 1945 he joined the South Australian Cricket Association and became their representative with the Board of Control and he seriously considered retiring from cricket in order to concentrate on an administrative role. He played a few games in 1945–46, but Richard Whittington thought he was [...] "the ghost of a once great cricketer". The press and public badly wanted to see him play and after a few warm up matches Bradman agreed to captain Australia against the advice of his doctor. In the First Test he played poorly for 28 when he chopped a ball to Jack Ikin in gully. The England players (and Keith Miller from the dressing room) thought he was out, but Bradman was confident that the ball had been jammed into the ground by his bat before it flew up to Ikin and refused to walk. The umpire gave him the benefit of the doubt, but Wally Hammond told Bradman [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series." [...] Bradman went on to make a match-winning 187 and it was thought if Bradman had been given out he would have retired from cricket.|$|E
2500|$|Don Tallon first {{appeared}} as a wicket-keeper in 1933 and was a shock exclusion for the Ashes tour in 1938. In 1939 he equalled Ted Pooley's record by dismissing 12 batsman in a first class match and another when he held 7 catches in another match. He was 30 {{when he made his}} Test debut and proved to be an excellent keeper, but in his eagerness would move in front of the slips, denying them the full view of the ball. Tallon was also [...] "one of the most notorious appealers of all time" [...] and [...] "was often roaring before he had studied facts and it was his over-eagerness that brought about the shocking decision which so greatly affected Washbrook". Tallon had scooped up a ball from the ground which the batsmen and other observers thought touched the ground, but having made the appeal Bradman backed Tallon and Washbrook was given out. However he improved on his performances and [...] Bill O'Reilly wrote [...] "I have never seen a better keeper than Tallon as he was in England in 1948. Otherwise Australia had a fine fielding team which was younger and quicker than their English opponents. Bradman himself has been a good mid-fielder, but was probably restricted by <b>fibrositis</b> and was unable to field in the Second Test due to a pulled leg muscle. Keith Miller [...] "was a captain's dream, because he is alert, sure and fast in no matter what position he is placed". Ian Johnson and Colin McCool were noted slip fielders and Sid Barnes was a good catcher close to the wicket at short-leg.|$|E
2500|$|The fast bowling of Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller {{was seen}} off by England's opening {{partnership}} as Len Hutton (94) and Cyril Washbrook (65) made another century stand; 137 runs in 178 minutes. Bradman declined {{to take the}} new ball when 200 runs were made (as was the custom in those days) and was rewarded when Bruce Dooland (3/133) removed Washbrook and Edrich and Colin McCool caught Hutton lbw. Wally Hammond was in so much pain from <b>fibrositis</b> that he took 12 aspirin before {{he went out to}} bat and was bowled by Ernie Toshack for 18 to leave England 202/4. Denis Compton (147) stroked his way to 147, adding 118 with Joe Hardstaff (67), 61 with Jack Ikin (21) and 74 with Norman Yardley (18 not out). It was his third first-class century in a row and [...] "It was amazing to see Compton occasionally run down the pitch, change his mind, and either play the ball like a baseball bunt, or scamper back to ground his bat in time to get {{the benefit of the doubt}} on a stumping appeal". Lindwall thought he should have been stumped before he reached his century, [...] "but I could well understand the umpire's explanation...that the glare of the sun suddenly became so intense that he was unable to see clearly the white line of the popping crease". In any case Lindwall quickly ended the innings with the new ball, he caught and bowled Compton to have England 455/7. In the next over he sent Alec Bedser's off-stump cart-wheeling back to the wicketkeeper, then bowled Godfrey Evans first ball, shaved Doug Wright's stumps before bowling him second ball - 3 wickets in 4 balls to end the innings for 460. This was the nearest that Lindwall ever got to a hat-trick.|$|E
2500|$|The great {{shock of}} the Fourth Test was that Mike Denness became the first Test captain to drop himself for poor form. Percy Chapman had dropped himself for the Fifth Test in 1928–29 because of flu and Wally Hammond in 1946–47 due to <b>fibrositis,</b> but in both these cases the series had already been decided. England could still win the series by winning the last three Tests, or hold onto the Ashes by winning two and drawing the other. Denness had made only 65 runs (10.83) {{so far in the}} series and was desperately out of form, but his {{replacement}} Keith Fletcher was hardly a better bet with 45 runs (11.25) and had been dropped for the Third Test. The vice-captain John Edrich was put in charge, an old pro who had captained Surrey since 1973, but was unlikely to fire up the team or take any chances. Geoff Arnold replaced the injured Mike Hendrick, but Chris Old was made twelfth man and England went into the match with just two fast bowlers on a lively green wicket that made Frank Tyson [...] "worry about the safety of the English batsmen". Australia made a change to their line up with the opener Wally Edwards being dropped after making 68 runs (11.33) in the first three Tests. He was replaced by the tall, athletic Rick McCosker who had made four consecutive first class centuries that season and 52 and 56 for NSW against the tourists. Unfortunately, this left Australia with only one opening batsman and McCosker was sent in with Ian Redpath on his debut, though admittedly on his home ground. Ian Chappell won the toss for the fourth time in a row (Edrich called heads, while Denness had always called tails) and chose to bat regardless of the help the wicket was due to give the bowlers.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of the 1953 season, England entered the summer facing a Test series against Australia, who had held the Ashes since 1934, captained by Lindsay Hassett. Critics {{considered}} that England had a good chance of regaining the Ashes following their form in 1952, but Australia remained confident, particularly after winning six of their first eight games by an innings (including a victory over Yorkshire). Once the Tests began, Hutton began well with scores of 43 and 60 not out in the drawn first Test. He had gone into the match with a cloud over his fitness following a shoulder injury, but top-scored in both innings. However, England's dismissal for just 144 in their first innings made Hutton doubtful about England's prospects for the series; only 14 wickets for Alec Bedser kept England in the match before rain came. Before the second Test, Hutton scored two fifties against the Australians for Yorkshire, but his fitness again came into question before the Test, this time with <b>fibrositis.</b> His movement was restricted while fielding, and he dropped three catches in Australia's first innings, injuring his thumb in the process. Despite these problems, Hutton scored 145 when he batted in England's first innings, reaching 2,000 Test runs against Australia in the process. He added 168 with Tom Graveney, batting with great freedom. Hutton shared another century stand with Compton, surviving a difficult spell with the new ball. Wisden said that the [...] "sight of England batsmen giving free rein to their strokes brought undisguised delight to many who had bemoaned the lack of aggression in so much Test cricket. The spectacle was glorious to behold." [...] The second innings was a different story, with Hutton dismissed early chasing a winnings total of 343, and it took a long stand between Willie Watson and Trevor Bailey to allow England to escape with a draw after a batting collapse.|$|E
2500|$|Cary wrote [...] "there was {{not doubt}} of the {{legality}} of the catch", Jack Fingleton called it [...] "one of the most unfortunate decisions {{in the history of the}} Tests." [...] and most English pressmen shared their view. However, E.W. Swanton reported [...] "The Don waited for the decision, confident that it was a bump ball, and the umpire Borwick, ruled 'not out'". In the Australian dressing rooms the players were divided as to whether he was out or not. When Bradman returned at the end of the session he said he had played down on a yorker and to Ray Lindwall there was no doubt as to his sincerity. In the end the batsman was given the benefit of the doubt, but it had repercussions. Bradman recovered his form and hit 159 runs in 160 minutes before he was out for 187, which set up Australia's victory in the First Test by an innings and 332 runs. This was a morale-booster for a young team with eight debutants, but if Bradman had been out the Australian total would have been less, England would have batted on a flat wicket and the thunderstorm that wrecked the wicket would have caught Australia in their second innings. 'As he walked past Bradman at the end of the over Hammond glared at Bradman and said tensely, [...] "That's a fine way to start a Test series"'. The England captain was furious that Bradman had not walked in what was supposed to be a post-war goodwill tour and refused to talk to him for the rest of the series except to call the toss. To the press he was more diplomatic [...] "I thought it was a catch but the umpire may have been right and I may have been wrong" [...] Bradman, 38 years old and suffering from <b>fibrositis,</b> had been advised not to play by his doctor and a cheap dismissal might have made him retire, especially if he had been caught on a sticky wicket in the second innings. Keith Miller later wrote [...] "that decision was subsequently admitted in nearly every quarter to have been erroneous".|$|E
2500|$|New South Wales had won 10 Sheffield Shields on the trot - {{though they}} would be ousted by Victoria {{by the end of}} the season - and had a team that was {{stronger}} than most Test sides; captain Richie Benaud, vice-captain Neil Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Grahame Thomas, Norm O'Neill, Brian Booth, Alan Davidson, Ray Flockton, Johnny Martin and Frank Misson. Ted Dexter won the toss and batted of course, but the MCC innings hinged on Geoff Pullar's 132. Even that was lucky as the Lancashire opener edged the ball to Simpson in the first over who dropped it, just to show that even the best slip fielders are not infallible. Pullar continued to struggle and give other chances, but he put this behind him and stuck to his work, which was just as well as only Dexter (42) and Cowdrey (50) stayed to help him out. 180/2 sank to 303/9 thanks to Benaud (3/61) and Martin (4/122), but tailend [...] "George" [...] thumped 30 to bring the total up to 348 a few minutes before stumps. Thomas survived one ball from Fred Trueman, successfully appealed for light and they all trooped back to the pavilion. On the second day Dexter resorted to his negative tactics of bowling on the leg stump with an on-side field, which was meant to restrict strokeplay. In this he failed as New South Wales rattled up 408/5 in the day, causing Benaud the remark that he had better change his way of thinking. Grahame Thomas was quickly bowled by Trueman (1/45), who then left the field with <b>fibrositis</b> and the MCC bowling attack lost all its bite. Simpson made 110 – his fourth hundred in four matches – and added 234 for the second wicket with Norm O'Neill, who had lost a few pounds and overcame his bad form to make 143 like a man on a mission. Booth (41), Harvey (63), Davidson (55), Flockton (62 not out) and Benaud (40 not out) kept the scoreboard moving at a fair rate and Benaud declared during the lunch break on the third day having made 124 runs in that morning to bring the total to 532/6. Davidson (1/11) removed David Sheppard for 7 and then it was all the spinners. Benaud took his best first class innings haul of 18-10-18-7 and Martin (2/32) picked up the wickets of Dexter and Cowdrey as the tourists crumbled to 104 all out to lose by an innings and 80 runs. It was New South Wales first innings victory over the MCC, and by definition their greatest victory over the English tourists.|$|E
2500|$|Peter May {{had missed}} the two Tests in 1961 and {{declined}} to make the gruelling 8 Test tour of India and Pakistan in 1961–62, as did Colin Cowdrey, Fred Trueman and Brian Statham. Ted Dexter {{was put in charge}} of a weakened team, like Barrington he had made his name in the West Indies and they had shared several big stands together. In an odd schedule the England team played Pakistan before going to India for a 5 Test series and returning to complete the series against Pakistan. In the First Test at Lahore England made a slow 380 batting second with Barrington adding 192 with M.J.K. Smith until he ran out his partner for 99 and himself for 139 after batting for over 7 hours. Pakistan collapsed suddenly in the second innings and England won a surprise victory by 5 wickets. In India they played the Combined Universities at Poona and Barrington made 149 not out in 290 minutes, but mimicked Slasher Mackay (who had toured India two years before) and when he took two wickets there was a pitch invasion as the crowd gave him presents, including a pair of sunglasses, which he used {{for the rest of the}} match, even when bowling. The match was broadcast on radio and Barrington became a star, which he played up to throughout the tour with imitations of Gary Sobers and a pompous Colonel, playing football with the ball and putting his fingers in his ears when the crowd shouted [...] "Mora, Mora" [...] (have a go). On a more practical side he forsaked local food, lived off egg and chips for almost the entire tour and kept an array of medicines to ward off illness (he lost 8lbs before the First Test). He was a great success in the series with innings of 151 not out, 52 not out, 21, 172, 113 not out, 14, 3, 20 and 48; a total of 594 runs (99.00). He made four centuries in four successive Tests for the first time, but the hosts won the Fourth and Fifth Tests. Returning to Pakistan he made 84 in the Second Test, but missed the Third due to <b>fibrositis,</b> an ailment suffered by Wally Hammond, Don Bradman and Len Hutton. He finished with 229 runs (76.33) in the series against Pakistan and 1,329 runs (69.94) on the tour, nearly 300 more than anyone else and top of the averages. It was no surprise that he was named the Indian Cricket Cricketer of the Year 1962.|$|E
2500|$|Hammond {{was made}} captain of England in 1938 when he {{achieved}} amateur status through {{being given a}} top job in a tyre company. This was {{the age of the}} [...] "Shamateur", when cricketers were given lucrative posts so that they would qualify for amateur status and captaincy of their county and country. He was with the RAF in South Africa during the war, but returned to play in 1945 and in the first full county season in 1946 made 1,783 runs (84.90) including six centuries in seven innings, making him easily the best batsman in England. Though the [...] at the MCC disliked having an ex-professional as England captain Hammond had no rivals to the post. On his arrival in Australia the news broke that he was divorcing his wife of 17 years to marry a South African beauty queen and the press had a field day. Hammond made centuries in his first two innings on the tour, 131 off Northam (with 19 fours and 4 sixes) and 208 against Western Australia, but suffered from <b>fibrositis</b> and let Yardley captain most of the early tour games. Hammond proved to be aloof and distant and at 43 was a generation older than the rest of his team, who held in him awe. Amateur captains used to readily consult their senior professional, but Hammond the ex-pro rarely sought anybody's advice, and [...] "sphinx-like marched from slip at one end to slip at the other, apparently, as Plum Warner wrote of him 'just letting the game go on'". He ordered his batsmen to stay in their crease and not attack the bowling and had his best bowlers running around the outfield between overs. In the Tests his highest Test score was only 37 and simply failed to concentrate as he used to; [...] "When I consider the hours I have spent against men like Grimmett and O'Reilly, never taking the slightest chance and patiently waiting for the loose ball to come along, I cannot understand why in 1946 I tried to hit spin bowlers off their length before I had been at the wicket ten minutes". Although averse to public speaking Hammond was very popular with the Australian public and was cheered whenever he appeared. One newspaper told its readers [...] "See him while you can. Your grandsons will feel you have let them down if you haven't seen him on their behalf". However, Hammond came [...] "as a cricket god, only to leave a failure both as a batsman and a captain". He retired on his return to England and moved to South Africa, where he remained detached from cricket until he took to the habit of visiting M.J.K. Smith's touring team just before he died in a car accident in 1965.|$|E
2500|$|The home {{side were}} {{still able to}} call on the bowlers of Don Bradman's Great 1948 Team; the hostile pace of Ray Lindwall (23.03) and Keith Miller (22.97), the left-arm swing and left arm spin of Bill Johnston (23.91), the {{flighted}} off-spinners of Ian Johnson and the mystery spin of Jack Iverson. Ray Lindwall was regarded as the finest fast bowler after the war, with a perfectly controlled action; [...] "he appears to be just jogging his fifteen yards up to the stumps - until {{the last couple of}} strides of his approach, when he suddenly explodes into his delivery stride...when he releases the ball, his bowling arm is so low that it borders on the round-arm". He had had a mixed tour of South Africa in 1949-50, failing to take a wicket in the first three South African innings and being dropped for the last Test, his form suffering from groin strain, <b>fibrositis</b> and a stomach disorder. This led to speculation that at 29 the fast bowler's career might soon be over as [...] "his pace was not what it was by any means, and his arm is much lower...his action is more laboured and his body does not follow through". Lindwall returned to the team and would bowl for Australia throughout the 1950s, though Lindsay Hassett tended to underuse him in the series, the opposite of Bradman who overbowled him. Keith Miller was the [...] "glamour boy" [...] of the Australian team [...] "his batting was a joy to behold, his fast bowling can be both fascinating to watch and deadly in effect, while his fielding in the slips and in the covers is feline in its anticipation and soundness". There was [...] a national outcry when he was not picked for the South Africa tour, both as the mercurial all rounder didn't want to bowl (his back had in injured when a night-fighter pilot in the Second World War), not helped by his well-known antipathy with the new Test selector Don Bradman, but was later flown out as a replacement. [...] "Big Bill" [...] Johnston was a powerful left-arm swing bowler who would be Australia's best wicket-taker in the series despite the fame of Lindwall and Miller. Like Miller he could bowl spin, but instead of mixing his bowling he saved his slow left arm spinners for when the opposition were caught on a sticky wicket. Ian Johnson was an off-spinner, a rarity in Australian cricket which tended to prefer leg-spinners. He was not a big turner of the ball, and one of the slowest bowlers in cricket, but he used flight to deceive the batsmen and tied down one end while the fast bowlers rested. To these veterans could be added the extraordinary mystery spin of Jack Iverson, who had found that he could use his long middle finger to turn the ball either way when whiling away the hours in the New Guinea campaign. Although never more than an occasional Grade cricketer before the war Iverson perfected his art and was chosen to play for his native Victoria in 1949-50, but {{was on the verge of}} quitting cricket when the England team arrived. He was 35 and his ailing father needed him to take over the family business, but stayed at the helm against his doctor's advice so that Iverson could play for Australia. He took 3/85 for Victoria vs the tourists and though he only dismissed three tailenders he caused the batsmen enough trouble to be picked for the Test team and the First Test at Brisbane was the first Test match he ever saw. His greatest day came in the Third Test at Sydney when he took 6/27 in Australia's innings victory. He retired at the end of the season even though he had [...] "the world's best batsmen at his mercy, if he could spare the time".|$|E
