This Review focuses on social housing in the European Union and aims at providing a clearer picture of the way social housing systems are structured across the EU, while identifying the main recent developments in the sector. In this article we attempt a brief analysis of the social housing sector from different perspectives: the diversity of definitions at the national level and common characteristics across Europe, the size of the sector, which kind of actors are involved in social housing provision, who can benefit from a social dwelling in the different national contexts, how the sector is financed and what are the most significant trends and challenges...|$|R

The OSI is part of the Brazilian <b>Social</b> <b>Observatory</b> (Observatório <b>Social</b> do Brasil), network which brings together approximately 50 organizations. The study describes Brazil’s recent boom in <b>social</b> <b>observatories</b> that focus on citizenship audit; analyses these observatories as instruments of social control and potential activators of other accountability mechanisms; {{discusses the}} relationship between their methods and their political practices; and identifies limitations in their activities. The research took place between 2009 and 2010, based on conceptual frameworks of accountability in public administration, document analysis, in-depth interviews and direct observation. It concludes that <b>social</b> <b>observatories</b> potentially connect government and society, coordinate technical with political action and contribute to the quality of public administration. Although facing challenges, such as that of the continuous production of technically and methodologically credible information and of involving diverse sectors of society, they reflect the potential for society’s engagement in social control, amid the maturing of political culture and the incorporation of the concept of accountability into the Brazilian institutional framework...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:Through the {{development}} of a proposal to categorize accountability into four stages - classical, cross-sectional, systemic, and diffused -, this article aims to identify characteristics of co-production of information and socio-political control of public administration in the work of Brazilian <b>social</b> <b>observatories</b> in relationship with government control agencies. The study analyses data from 20 <b>social</b> <b>observatories</b> and, particularly, three experiences of co-production of information and control, based on a systemic perspective on accountability and a model with four categories: Political and cultural; valuing; systemic-organizational, and production. The conclusions summarize characteristics of these practices, specific phases in the accountability processes, as well as the potentialities and challenges of co-production of information and control, which not only influences, but it is also influenced by the accountability system...|$|R
