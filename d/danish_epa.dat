5000|$|Styrene is {{regarded}} as a [...] "hazardous chemical", especially in case of eye contact, but also in case of skin contact, of ingestion and of inhalation, according to several sources. Styrene is largely metabolized into styrene oxide in humans, resulting from oxidation by cytochrome P450. Styrene oxide is considered toxic, mutagenic, and possibly carcinogenic. Styrene oxide is subsequently hydrolyzed in vivo to styrene glycol by the enzyme epoxide hydrolase. [...] The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has described styrene to be [...] "a suspected toxin to the gastrointestinal tract, kidney, and respiratory system, among others". On 10 June 2011, the U.S. National Toxicology Program has described styrene as [...] "reasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen". However, a STATS author describes a review that was done on scientific literature and concluded that [...] "The available epidemiologic evidence does not support a causal relationship between styrene exposure and any type of human cancer". [...] Despite this claim, work has been done by Danish researchers to investigate the relationship between occupational exposure to styrene and cancer. They concluded, [...] "The findings have to be interpreted with caution, due to the company based exposure assessment, but the possible association between exposures in the reinforced plastics industry, mainly styrene, and degenerative disorders of the nervous system and pancreatic cancer, deserves attention". The <b>Danish</b> <b>EPA</b> recently concluded that the styrene data do not support a cancer concern for styrene.|$|E

40|$|In Denmark {{several factors}} like the {{national}} pesticide action plan, ethical questions, national research strategy, increasing share of organic farming and fees are affecting the policy regarding regulatory agencies approach for products supporting sustainable pest management. The use of microbial pesticides in Denmark are limited, with the relatively largest share used in the greenhouse sector. Approval of a product not sold in Denmark before July 26, 1993 consists of two parts: An EU approval of the active micro-organism, and a national approval of the product containing the active micro-organism. An EU approval of an active micro-organism is only granted if the active micro-organism is included in Annex I of the directive of authorized active organisms. As a main principle, an active micro-organism shall be entered {{on the list of}} authorized active organisms before the <b>Danish</b> <b>EPA</b> may grant an approval for sale or import of products containing active micro-organisms. Until now five new organisms have been recommended for EU approval and inclusion in Annex I of the Directive, but so far none have been included. For products sold in Denmark before July 26, 1993 a transitional scheme specified in the Order is applied. Under this procedure application for approval of such products should be submitted to the <b>Danish</b> <b>EPA</b> before July 26, 1994 if the products were intended for sale in Denmark after this date. The application is considered at a national level only by the <b>Danish</b> <b>EPA.</b> The <b>Danish</b> <b>EPA</b> has received applications concerning nine different active micro-organisms.

30|$|Prerequisite for an {{appropriate}} aggregation of PFC in groups is an identical mechanism of action. For this purpose {{little is known}} about PFC. Some hints are given in the reviews by Stahl et al. [32], Borg and Håkansson [68], the <b>Danish</b> <b>EPA</b> [69], and the ATSDR [3]. According to these, the ability of the PFC to activate the PPARα seems to be especially significant. As described in “General description of human health effects and ambiguities” section PPARα regulates the fatty acid oxidation in liver, exerts an influence on reproduction and child development, and is thought {{to be associated with the}} induction of tumors in the liver of rodents by non-genotoxic carcinogens. Because of their structural analogy to endogenous fatty acids, PFC are transported via a reversible bond to albumin in blood. They are also ligands of the PPARα of the cell nucleus. The binding to PPARα leads to peroxisomal proliferation and subsequently to the catabolism of fatty acids, especially in liver as the main organ for the storage and mobilization of lipids. Such peroxisome proliferators are the cause of hepatocellular hypertrophy and an increased liver weight.|$|E
40|$|Several recent {{publications}} reflect {{debate on}} the issue of “endocrine disrupting chemicals” (EDCs), indicating that two seemingly mutually exclusive perspectives are being articulated separately and independently. Considering this, a group of scientists with expertise in basic science, medicine and risk assessment reviewed the various aspects of the debate to identify the most significant areas of dispute and to propose a path forward. We identified four areas of debate. The first is about the definitions for terms such as “endocrine disrupting chemical”, “adverse effects”, and “endocrine system”. The second is focused on elements of hormone action including “potency”, “endpoints”, “timing”, “dose” and “thresholds”. The third addresses the information needed to establish sufficient evidence of harm. Finally, the fourth focuses on the need to develop and the characteristics of transparent, systematic methods to review the EDC literature. Herein we identify areas of general consensus and propose resolutions for these four areas that would allow the field to move beyond the current and, in our opinion, ineffective debate.

40|$|Prior to the REACH legislation, NGOs {{struggled}} {{for the implementation}} of a full consumer right to know about chemicals, and the European Commission expected increased public information to become a driving force in substitution of hazardous chemicals. The REACH Article 33 (2) gives consumers the right to request information from retailers on Substances of Very High Concern (SVHC) on the Candidate List in articles. Thus, the objective of this project is to assess whether the Article 33 (2) can drive substitution of SVHC through analysis of the current practice of Article 33 (2). Article 33 (2) is described according to the official REACH legislation and guidance from the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The analysis is based on three inquires about Article 33 (2) conducted by the Danish consumer organisation (Forbrugerrådet), the European federation of NGOs (European Environmental Bureau) and a environmental project under the <b>Danish</b> <b>EPA</b> respectively, interviews with the Danish trade organisation Dansk Erhverv, Forbrugerrådet and professor of environmental law (Peter Pagh), and my attendance at the conference Kemikaliedag 2010. Due to lack of consumer knowledge or interest in using Article 33 (2), substitution {{as a direct result of}} Article 33 (2) is presently not seen. Current misconceptions among NGOs and companies according to both rights and obligations under Article 33 (2) provide a great demand for further clarification of definitions and requirements under Article 33 (2) from ECHA or Forum. However, some retailers have a policy of avoiding SVHC, and it is recommended that these proactive companies are rewarded with official certificates to document their policy or an official „pre-Candidate List that could serve as a useful tool for companies to be ahead in substitution while the Candidate List slowly expands. This might imply substitution of SVHC to safer alternatives for environment and health, despite the lacking efficiency of Article 33 (2) ...|$|E
40|$|The present {{appendix}} provides {{background information}} {{for the assessment of}} the need for further risk reduction and relevant risk reduction measures. For each of the 23 products types, the appendix provides a short overview of: Application areas; Substances under the product type; Data on production/consumption; Risks to humans; Risks to the environment; Assessment of need for risk reduction; Relevant risk reduction measures. The description of the applications and the human and environmental exposures is- unless otherwise indicated- extracted from an assessment of the use of biocides in Denmark (Lassen et al. 2001) and an unpublished exposure assessment undertaken as part of the same study for the <b>Danish</b> <b>EPA</b> (COWI/CETOX 2001). The description is supplemented with information obtained from a number of Emission Scenario Documents developed mainly {{in the context of the}} EU EUBEES I and II projects or by the OECD Task Force on Environmental Exposure Assessment. For a quantitative assessment of use of specific biocides, confidential production data has been reviewed by the study team at ECB in Ispra in July 2008 (Kjølholt 2008). Each PT description has a last section with an assessment of risks to humans and the environment from the use of the products in the PT in question. The assessment is not for the individual substances/products and their applications as this is taken care of in the EU review and decision process regarding inclusion of substances on Annex I of the BPD. Rather, it is an attempt to make a crude, overall/aggregated relative assessment of risk levels in a Community perspective.
