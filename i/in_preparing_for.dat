5|$|To {{assist the}} actors <b>in</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> their roles, Scott wrote several pages of backstory for each {{character}} explaining their histories. He filmed {{many of their}} rehearsals in order to capture spontaneity and improvisation, and tensions between some of the cast members, particularly towards the less-experienced Weaver; this translated convincingly to film as tension between the characters.|$|E

Both Driver and Garfield {{went through}} a 7-day Jesuit silent prayer vigil {{arranged}} {{with the help of}} the Jesuit scholar Martin to prepare them for their roles in the film. Garfield, in an interview with Stephen Colbert, stated that both actors felt emaciated <b>in</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> their roles and that Driver lost close to 50 pounds in preparation to play his role in the film.|$|E
5|$|Hoffman's second role of {{the year}} came {{opposite}} Meryl Streep and Amy Adams in John Patrick Shanley's Doubt, where he played Father Brendan Flynn– a priest accused of sexually abusing a 12-year-old African American student in the 1960s. Hoffman was already familiar with the play and appreciated the opportunity {{to bring it to}} the screen; <b>in</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> the role, he talked extensively to a priest who lived through the era. The film had a mixed reception, with some critics such as Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian suspicious of it as Oscar bait, but Hoffman gained second consecutive Best Supporting Actor nominations at the Oscars, BAFTAs, and Golden Globes, and was also nominated by the Screen Actors Guild.|$|E

5|$|In {{advance of}} the storm, the {{governor}} of Baja California Sur, Narciso Agundez, ordered emergency personnel to Comondú, Lorteo, and Mulege. Approximately 700 families fled to shelters in Cabo San Lucas; elsewhere, an additional 200 families evacuated in San Jose del Cabo. Some residents in Miraflores and Santiago also left their homes. Agundez asked soldiers to assist the islands of Magdalena and Margarita <b>in</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> the storm. Five communities in Mexico, including Cabo San Lucas, {{declared a state of}} emergency. Authorities throughout the region opened numerous shelters, and in some locations, police officers went door-to-door asking residents to leave. The port in Cabo San Lucas was closed due to the storm's threat, although the airport remained open.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> their roles, {{the actors}} were granted access to lawyers who {{would act as}} advisors. Ford {{observed}} murder trials with Pakula at the Recorder's Court in Detroit and viewed training footage from the Michigan Prosecutors' Association. Greta Scacchi, who plays Carolyn Polhemus, observed Linda Fairstein, head of the Manhattan District Attorney's sex crimes unit. Raúl Juliá, who plays Sandy Stern, researched his role by meeting with criminal lawyer Michael Kennedy. Paul Winfield lobbied {{for the role of}} Judge Larren Lyttle upon reading the novel and learning that the adaptation was to be directed by Pakula. Winfield met with New York Supreme Court judge Bruce M. Wright, who insisted that he wear a judiciary robe and observe several cases.|$|E
5|$|The film cast three Bajau teenagers, Gita Novalista, Eko and Zainal, {{in their}} feature film debuts; {{the three were}} the first Bajau {{to play in a}} feature film. More {{experienced}} actors, including Atiqah Hasiholan and Reza Rahadian (who had received two Citra Awards), were also cast. Hasiholan later stated that it had been her most challenging role yet, citing the cultural differences between the Bajau and what she was familiar with as well as her unprecedented need to act as a mother. <b>In</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> their roles, Hasiholan exercised slicing and dicing fish, while Rahadian went to Ancol in North Jakarta to learn about dolphins.|$|E

5|$|The war also {{reflected}} a new height in military spending, especially by the Habsburgs. After the Seven Years' War, {{the size of}} the Habsburg military shrank, from 201,311men in arms in 1761 to 163,613in 1775. <b>In</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> a second summer's campaign, Joseph's army grew from 195,108effectives in the summer of 1778 to 308,555men in arms in Spring 1779. Habsburg military strength never dropped below two hundred thousand effectives between 1779 and 1792, when Austria entered the War of the First Coalition. Several times it surged above three hundred thousand men in arms, responding to needs on the Ottoman border or the revolt in the Austrian Netherlands. The military also underwent a massive organizational overhaul.|$|E
5|$|Construction was {{slated for}} the {{interchange}} with County Routes 516 and 527 in Old Bridge {{as there is}} no way to access either of them without driving through a residential area off Route 18. The traffic flow along CR 516 (Old Bridge into Matawan) and 527 (Old Bridge into Englishtown/Manalapan) has increased significantly in the past ten years which called for the exit ramp off Route 18. The Old Bridge improvements include adding inside shoulders and widening County Routes 516 and 527. A signalized ramp is to be added for access to County Routes 516 and 527. Subsequently, County Route 516's intersection with Old Matawan Road is to be relocated. The project would cost over $28 million and was slated to begin in 2009 and to end in 2010. As of the end of 2009 the large project was put on hold because of the lack of funds and the economic situation. Demolition was completed in 2009 on Marlboro Road, taking down several residential houses and along Old Matawan Road and CR 516 and taking down an old gas station <b>in</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> the project. There is no new date released by NJDOT in when construction will begin.|$|E
5|$|Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels, a pacifistic journalist, {{had built}} up the {{educational}} resources of the Navy and made its Naval War College an essential experience for would-be admirals. However, he alienated the officer corps with his moralistic reforms (no wine in the officers' mess, no hazing at Annapolis, more chaplains and YMCAs). Ignoring the nation's strategic needs, and disdaining the advice of its experts, Daniels suspended meetings of the Joint Army and Navy Board for two years because it was giving unwelcome advice. He chopped in half the General Board's recommendations for new ships, reduced the authority of officers in the Navy yards where ships were built and repaired, and ignored the administrative chaos in his department. Bradley Fiske, {{one of the most}} innovative admirals in American naval history, was Daniels' top aide in 1914; he recommended a reorganization that would prepare for war, but Daniels refused. Instead, he replaced Fiske in 1915 and brought in for the new post of Chief of Naval Operations an unknown captain, William S. Benson. Chosen for his compliance, Benson proved a wily bureaucrat who was more interested <b>in</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> an eventual showdown with Britain than an immediate one with Germany.|$|E

5|$|The Confederate assault, {{despite its}} shortcomings, was ferocious, causing {{some of the}} {{numerous}} inexperienced Union soldiers in Grant's new army to flee to the river for safety. Others fought well, but were forced to withdraw under strong pressure from the Confederates, and attempted to form new defensive lines. Many Union regiments fragmented entirely; the companies and sections that remained on the field attached themselves to other commands. Sherman, who had been negligent <b>in</b> <b>preparing</b> <b>for</b> an attack, became {{one of its most}} important elements. He appeared everywhere along his lines, inspiring his raw recruits to resist the initial assaults, despite the staggering losses on both sides. Sherman received two minor wounds and had three horses shot out from under him. Historian James M. McPherson cites the battle as the turning point of Sherman's life, helping him {{to become one of the}} North's premier generals. Sherman's division bore the brunt of the initial attack. Despite heavy fire on their position and their left flank crumbling, Sherman's men fought stubbornly, but the Union troops slowly lost ground and fell back to a position behind Shiloh Church. McClernand's division temporarily stabilized the position. Overall, however, Johnston's forces made steady progress until noon, rolling up Union positions one by one. As the Confederates advanced, many threw away their flintlock muskets and grabbed rifles dropped by the fleeing Union troops.|$|E
