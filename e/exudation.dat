25|$|TNT {{is prone}} to <b>exudation</b> of dinitrotoluenes and other isomers of trinitrotoluene. Even small {{quantities}} of such impurities can cause such effect. The effect shows especially in projectiles containing TNT and stored at higher temperatures, e.g. during summer. <b>Exudation</b> of impurities leads to formation of pores and cracks (which in turn cause increased shock sensitivity). Migration of the exudated liquid into the fuze screw thread can form fire channels, increasing the risk of accidental detonations; fuze malfunction can result from the liquids migrating into its mechanism. Calcium silicate is mixed with TNT to mitigate the tendency towards <b>exudation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Low-phosphorus {{concentrations}} in the soil increase hyphal growth and branching as well as induce plant <b>exudation</b> of compounds that control hyphal branching intensity.|$|E
50|$|Adults {{have been}} {{recorded}} imbibing <b>exudations</b> from the ends of broken branches of Tournefortia argentea lying on the ground, presumably for the pyrrolizidine alkaloids that may {{be present in the}} <b>exudations.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{evidence}} for ectomycorrhizal priming {{is so far}} inconclusive. Field evidence suggests that ectomycorrhizal fungi may be increasing the rate of soil carbon degradation, however lab tests show that <b>exudation</b> from fine roots decreases with increasing ectomycorrhizal colonization, which suggests that abundance of ectomycorrhizal fungi should reduce priming effects. Brzostek et al. (2012) report variation in form of nitrogen produced in the rhizosphere of trees that vary in mycorrhizal type, however the effects of root and mycorrhizal priming could not be separated.|$|E
25|$|The {{components}} {{are still being}} studied and are not determined with absolute certainty. Stacte is variously described as being the extract of the transparent portion of the myrrh resin which exudes spontaneously from the tree, or a balsam from a tree such as opobalsamum or a styrax. Onycha, which in Greek means “nail,” is variously described as being the operculum from a shell found in the Red Sea (which are said to resemble a fingernail), the <b>exudation</b> from the rock rose bush called labdanum (both petals and markings which are said to resemble a fingernail), Styrax benzoin, bdellium, or even cloves. Galbanum is {{generally considered to be}} Ferula galbaniflua. Also considered is a milder variety from the Levant or possibly even a close relative of Ferula galbaniflua called narthex (or giant fennel). Pure frankincense is the resin of a tree of the boswellia species.|$|E
25|$|The troops worst {{affected}} had intense cyanosis and frothy <b>exudation</b> {{from the}} mouth and nose; some of the severe casualties who reached casualty clearing stations, had a pallor and collapse associated with phosgene poisoning. In a few cases cyanosis gave place to pallor before the victim died. The troops who died rapidly in the front line, about ninety minutes after {{the beginning of the}} attack, showed deep cyanosis and copious frothing, with paroxysmal coughing prominent in the early stages. The clinical evidence suggested that the gas cloud contained a low proportion of phosgene to chlorine. About twenty civilians were affected by the gas, though none severely, as they had been instructed in gas precautions and had been issued with respirators. The civilians had also protected themselves by closing windows and doors and by filling cracks with wet cloths; many also wore anti-gas helmets indoors.|$|E
40|$|European {{pear sucker}} causes {{financial}} penalties in many pear orchards. Honey dew <b>exudations</b> reduce qual-ity. Another {{problem is the}} transmission of pear decline. In years of high infestation chemical treatments are complicated. Neither cutisan- nor sugar-treatments showed an appreciable reduction of the pest in the year 2005. ...|$|R
5000|$|From their mouthparts, it {{is assumed}} that all adult stag beetles are liquid feeders. Adult Geodorcus beetles feed on sappy <b>exudations</b> from trees. Stag beetle larvae consume rotting wood at or above ground but a few species live {{underground}} and feed on either roots or humus.|$|R
50|$|This fish {{produces}} live young, with litter sizes varying {{between two}} and twenty, {{with an average of}} six young. Before they are born, the young feed on the egg yolks, and later on <b>exudations</b> from the maternal uterus. They are usually 20 to 30 cm across the disc at birth.|$|R
2500|$|Depending {{upon the}} {{incubation}} time chosen, net or {{gross primary production}} can be estimated. [...] Gross primary production is best estimated using relatively short incubation times (1 hour or less), since the loss of incorporated 14C (by respiration and organic material excretion / <b>exudation)</b> will be more limited. [...] Net primary production is the fraction of gross production remaining after these loss processes have consumed some of the fixed carbon.|$|E
2500|$|The {{traditional}} {{theory of}} EDA holds that skin resistance {{varies with the}} state of sweat glands in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, Because sweat contains dielectrics (salt, etc.), conductivity is increased when the sweat glands are activated. But some advocates argue that the meter responds more quickly than would be possible by the <b>exudation</b> and drying of sweat. They propose an additional mechanism termed the [...] "Tarchanoff Response" [...] through which the cerebral cortex of the brain affects the current directly. This phenomenon is not completely understood, and further research needs to be performed.|$|E
2500|$|When {{grown for}} opium production, {{the skin of}} the {{ripening}} pods of these poppies is scored by a sharp blade at a time carefully chosen so that rain, wind, and dew cannot spoil the <b>exudation</b> of white, milky latex, usually in the afternoon. Incisions are made while the pods are still raw, with no more than a slight yellow tint, and must be shallow to avoid penetrating hollow inner chambers or loculi while cutting into the lactiferous vessels. In Indian Subcontinent, Afghanistan, Central Asia and Iran, the special tool used to make the incisions is called a nushtar or [...] "nishtar" [...] (from Persian, meaning a lancet) and carries three or four blades three millimeters apart, which are scored upward along the pod. Incisions are made three or four times at intervals of two to three days, and each time the [...] "poppy tears", which dry to a sticky brown resin, are collected the following morning. One acre harvested in this way can produce three to five kilograms of raw opium. In the Soviet Union, pods were typically scored horizontally, and opium was collected three times, or else one or two collections were followed by isolation of opiates from the ripe capsules. Oil poppies, an alternative strain of P. somniferum, were also used for production of opiates from their capsules and stems. A traditional Chinese method of harvesting opium latex involved cutting off the heads and piercing them with a coarse needle then collecting the dried opium 24 to 48 hours later.|$|E
50|$|These beetles are nocturnal, {{and their}} feeding {{behaviour}} is unknown. Adult stag beetles worldwide have mouthparts suited to feeding on liquids. Geodorcus helmsi {{has been seen}} feeding on sappy <b>exudations</b> on tree trunks. Rotting wood, tree roots or humus {{are the most common}} food sources for stag beetle larvae, and G. ithaginis lives in an environment of enriched humus.|$|R
50|$|The {{butterfly}} inhabits low-lying jungle in very wet regions. The {{males are}} fond of sitting {{on the tops of}} leaves not very high off the ground and making short circular flights. The females flutter about amongst the undergrowth and bushes at forest edges. The butterfly has also been recorded by one observer to settle over hosts of greenflies (aphids), tickle them with the proboscis and feed on the <b>exudations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Adult beetles {{have been}} found under fallen logs in the moist layer of {{decaying}} wood between a log and the soil underneath it. Forest types vary and include canopies of tawa, rimu, northern rata, kauri, red and hard beech. Like other Geodorcus species G. auriculatus spends its entire life in cool damp environments such as under logs and rocks, emerging at night to feed on sappy <b>exudations</b> from trees or other plants.|$|R

60|$|It is an {{interesting}} fact, first noticed by Schelver, that, in several genera belonging to two sub-families, the males on first emergence from the pupal state, are coloured exactly like the females; but that their bodies {{in a short time}} assume a conspicuous milky-blue tint, owing to the <b>exudation</b> of a kind of oil, soluble in ether and alcohol. Mr. MacLachlan believes that in the male of Libellula depressa this change of colour does not occur until nearly a fortnight after the metamorphosis, when the sexes are ready to pair.|$|E
5000|$|These constructions often {{pertain to}} a certain {{semantic}} category: purposive relationships, habitual relations and possession of body parts. In the following example from Musgrave (2007, p.75), the possessed noun is a person and the possessor noun in an occupation:While some body parts are directly possessed nouns, some body parts (such as internal organs, bodily <b>exudations</b> etc.) are indirectly possessed nouns and most often pertain to an alienable semantic relationship.

60|$|The {{storm had}} raged for twenty-four hours, {{but it had}} now passed, {{and it was a}} calm night when a little party sat in George's living-room. Outside, the white prairie lay still and silent under the Arctic frost, but there was no breath of wind {{stirring}} and the room was comfortably warm. A big stove glowed in the middle of it, and the atmosphere was permeated with the smell of hot iron, stale tobacco, and the <b>exudations</b> from resinous boards.|$|R

"Without {{going too}} much into detail, madam--for you would {{probably}} not understand it, anyway--I concede that great care {{is going to be}} necessary here; otherwise <b>exudation</b> of the esophagus is nearly sure to ensue, and this will be followed by ossification and extradition of the maxillaris superioris, which must decompose the granular surfaces of the great infusorial ganglionic system, thus obstructing the action of the posterior varioloid arteries, and precipitating compound strangulated sorosis of the valvular tissues, and ending unavoidably in the dispersion and combustion of the marsupial fluxes and the consequent embrocation of the bicuspid populo redax referendum rotulorum." ...|$|E

Not improbably Coleridge was thinking of manna, a saccharine <b>exudation</b> found upon certain plants in the East. Mandeville describes it as found in [...] "the Land of Job:" [...] "This Manna is clept Bread of Angels. And it is a white Thing that is full sweet and right delicious, and more sweet than Honey or Sugar. And it Cometh of the Dew of Heaven that falleth upon the Herbs in that Country.

60|$|Actions of all kinds, if {{regularly}} accompanying {{any state}} of the mind, are at once recognized as expressive. These may consist of movements of {{any part of the}} body, as the wagging of a dog's tail, the shrugging of a man's shoulders, the erection of the hair, the <b>exudation</b> of perspiration, the {{state of the}} capillary circulation, laboured breathing, {{and the use of the}} vocal or other sound-producing instruments. Even insects express anger, terror, jealousy, and love by their stridulation. With man the respiratory organs are of especial importance in expression, not only in a direct, but in a still higher degree in an indirect manner.|$|E
40|$|Endoscopic {{findings}} of an 18 -year {{old man with}} intermittent dysphagia showed widespread white <b>exudations</b> of the oesophagus. First misinterpreted as oesophageal candidiasis the mucosal biopsies revealed the histological features of a severe eosinophilic oesophagitis. Under treatment with topical steroids the symptoms dissolved. The control endoscopy showed a histological remission with absence of eosinophilic granulocytes, too. The eosinophilic oesophagitis is a rare allergy-like inflammation of the oesophagus especially seen in young men with increasing incidence. Without treatment the long-term risk of eosinophilic oesophagitis is the induction of severe oesophageal strictures...|$|R
40|$|Evidence {{has been}} {{presented}} {{to show that the}} autotrophic nitrifying organisms get stimulated in the mulberry rhizosphere. Three species of Pseudomonas, one each of Achromobacter and Bacillus capable of degrading methionine were shown to be stimulated in the rhizosphere. These bacteria were capable of reversing the inhibitory effect of methionine on soil nitrification. Two of them were able to form nitrite from methionine. The possibility that the increased nitrifying activity in the mulberry rhizosphere in the presence of methionine found in mulberry root <b>exudations</b> {{was the result of the}} activity of these organisms was suggested...|$|R
5000|$|While {{acacia gum}} has been {{harvested}} in Arabia, Sudan, and West Asia since antiquity, sub-Saharan acacia gum {{has a long}} history as a prized export. The gum exported came from the band of acacia trees that once covered much of the Sahel region: the southern littoral of the Sahara Desert that runs from the Atlantic to the Red Sea. Today, the main populations of gum-producing Acacia species are harvested in Mauritania, Senegal, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria, Chad, Cameroon, Sudan, Eritrea, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania. Acacia senegal is tapped for gum by cutting holes in the bark, from which a product called kordofan or Senegal gum is exuded. Seyal gum, from Acacia seyal, the species more prevalent in East Africa, is collected from naturally occurring <b>exudations</b> on the bark. Traditionally harvested by seminomadic desert pastoralists {{in the course of their}} transhumance cycle, acacia gum remains a main export of several African nations, including Mauritania, Niger, Chad, and Sudan. The hardened <b>exudations</b> are collected in the middle of the rainy season (harvesting usually begins in July), and exported at the start of the dry season (November). Total world gum arabic exports are today (2008) estimated at 60,000 tonnes, having recovered from 1987-1989 and 2003-2005 crises caused by the destruction of trees by the desert locust. Sudan, Chad, and Nigeria, which in 2007 together produced 95% of world exports, have been in discussions to create a producers' cartel.|$|R
60|$|In {{the morning}} the sun shone, she got up strong and dancing. Skrebensky was still at the Marsh. He was coming to church. How lovely, how amazing life was! On the fresh Sunday morning {{she went out to}} the garden, among the yellows and the deep-vibrating reds of autumn, she smelled the earth and felt the gossamer, the cornfields across the country were pale and unreal, {{everywhere}} was the intense silence of the Sunday morning, filled with unacquainted noises. She smelled the body of the earth, it seemed to stir its powerful flank beneath her as she stood. In the bluish air came the powerful <b>exudation,</b> the peace was the peace of strong, exhausted breathing, the reds and yellows and the white gleam of stubble were the quivers and motion of the last subsiding transports and clear bliss of fulfilment.|$|E
6000|$|Unfortunately, {{the saints}} {{seem to have}} {{forgotten}} to mention where they wished to go; and, with the most anxious desire to gratify their smallest wishes, Eginhard was naturally greatly perplexed what to do. While in this state of mind, he was one day contemplating his [...] "great and wonderful treasure, more precious than all the gold in the world," [...] when it struck him that the chest in which the relics were contained was quite unworthy of its contents; and after vespers he gave orders {{to one of the}} sacristans to take the measure of the chest in order that a more fitting shrine might be constructed. The man, having lighted a wax candle and raised the pall which covered the relics, in order to carry out his master's orders, was astonished and terrified to observe that the chest was covered with a blood-like <b>exudation</b> (loculum mirum in modum humore sanguineo undique distillantem), and at once sent a message to Eginhard. {383} ...|$|E
6000|$|On {{going to}} the palace early one morning, after the saints were safely {{bestowed}} at Seligenstadt, he found Hildoin waiting for an audience in the Emperor's antechamber, and began {{to talk to him}} about the miracle of the bloody <b>exudation.</b> In the course of conversation, Eginhard happened to allude to the remarkable fineness of the garment of the blessed Marcellinus. Whereupon Abbot Hildoin observed (to Eginhard's stupefaction) that his observation was quite correct. Much astonished at this remark from a person was supposed not to have seen the relics, Eginhard asked him how he knew that? Upon this, Hildoin saw he had better make a clean breast of it, and he told the following story, which he had received from his priestly agent, Hunus. While Hunus and Lunison were at Pavia, waiting for Eginhard's notary, Hunus (according to his own account) had robbed the robbers. The relics were placed in a church; and a number of laymen and clerics, of whom Hunus was one, undertook to keep watch over them. One night, however, all the watchers, save wide-awake Hunus, went to sleep; and then, according to the story which this [...] "sharp" [...] ecclesiastic foisted upon his patron, ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly I {{became aware}} of the strong fumes of tobacco. Turning my head, I saw a pale blue smoke curling up from behind an {{adjacent}} boulder. Rising, and climbing over the intermediate granite, I came upon a little hollow, in which, comfortably extended on the mosses and lichens, lay a powerfully-built man. He was very ragged; he was very dirty; there was a strong suggestion about him of his having too much hair, too much nail, too much perspiration; too much of those superfluous excrescences and <b>exudations</b> that society and civilization strive to keep under. But it was noticeable that he had not much of anything else. It was The Tramp.|$|R
