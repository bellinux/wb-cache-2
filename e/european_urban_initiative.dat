Policy interventions may produce unintended results also depending on the decision-making process adopted [33].

As a first step, it is fundamental to perform ex-ante behavioral analyses focusing on policy/solution acceptability, taking into account stakeholders’ preferences, in order to provide policy-makers with an efficient and effective decision-support system [17, 23, 24].|$|R

The programme, aimed at solving social-economic problems in deprived neighbourhoods in European cities, has acted {{as a catalyst for}} new forms of cooperation. Whether it has directly contributed to Europeanization at the local level seems questionable, but it has certainly helped some city administrations to enter the European stage.

40|$|The {{relevance}} {{of the relationship between}} evaluation and learning is widely acknowledged; as well as the importance of this learning process to support policy decision making and to judge the value of “what was done”, “how” and “with what results”. Although the activity of evaluation is not something new, but a field of knowledge with its own theories and practices, it is important to notice that there is great variability in the tradition and cultures of evaluation between countries. This paper presents and compares different conceptual and methodological frameworks created for the assessment of the <b>European</b> <b>initiative</b> <b>Urban</b> II, including the one that was used by the author {{in the context of an}} academic evaluation in the city of Porto. The comparative analysis of the results leads us to the recommendation for more democratic processes of evaluation and intervention, in order to improve their quality and accountability and promote the important goal of learning with this type of experimental initiatives.

40|$|Reunification profoundly {{challenged}} {{the local government}} structure inherited from the Cold War period in Berlin. Yet this sudden socioeconomic and political change did not produce any immediate impact on institutional arrangements or policy instruments within the urban policy field. In this context, {{the implementation of the}} <b>European</b> Community <b>Initiative</b> <b>URBAN,</b> between 1994 and 1999, offered an opportunity to actors who were willing to challenge the existing balance of power to contest the legitimacy of preexisting interests and representations. The author argues that, in a context of competing interpretations of the issues raised by segregation processes which have left pockets of poverty in both parts of the city, the URBAN programme has managed to become an important driving force behind an underlying process of change. Its innovative approach to urban poverty and social exclusion exerted an impact on the parameters of this process of change, exacerbating existing political and organisational conflicts and challenging local networks, sources of legitimacy, and policy instruments. ...|$|R

Empirical {{research on the}} policy network of the EU <b>URBAN</b> <b>Initiative</b> in Portugal and Greece illustrates the ineffectiveness of the current approach in acknowledging the socio-economic and political specificities that influence development prospects in lagging cities. The Commission's proposals on the reform of the Funds (2007 [...] 13) suggest the incorporation of EU urban programmes in the mainstream spatial policies framework. The rationale, however, remains unchanged. The context-free emphasis put in these proposals on the 'competitiveness’ target mitigates the 'cohesion’ objective and risks perpetuating uneven urban development trends. ...|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} growing {{significance}} {{of cities and}} urban governance in two interrelated areas: first, regarding national and European socio-economic objectives; second, regarding the processes and spatial implications of inter-urban competition at the EU level. The European Union, {{in the attempt to}} tackle disparities and promote economic competitiveness, has developed <b>initiatives</b> for an <b>urban</b> level of policy-making. Central to such a response, it is argued, is the integration into the European policy framework of the fundamental heterogeneity of urban governance structures in Europe. One particular and prominent dimension of urban disparities in Europe is the North-South polarisation of the emerging <b>European</b> <b>urban</b> hierarchy. The thesis goes beyond the traditional economic focus of urban governance studies in its attempt to understand the relatively poor competitive position of cities in Portugal, Greece and Spain. The thesis stresses the analysis of the process of urbanisation from a socio-political perspective: focusing upon the mode of social, economic and political restructuring and competitive orientation of the local level in Southern Europe. The research presented here examines the competitive position of Spain, Greece and Portugal at the local level and the structural divergence of the Southern European urbanisation process from the 'ideal-typical' Fordist/post-Fordist mode of urban restructuring and resurgence. The thesis highlights the characteristic urban governance arrangements of Spain, Greece and Portugal which, it argues, are a causal factor of the lagging competitiveness of Southern European cities. This pattern of <b>European</b> <b>urban</b> heterogeneity is not addressed in the emerging EU policies on urban governance. Case-studies of two EU urban programmes from the 1994 - 99 policy framework, the RECITE networks and the <b>URBAN</b> <b>Initiative,</b> are used to further illustrate the argument. The conclusion highlights the problems, possibilities and consequences of the Community's current pattern of urban intervention...|$|R

40|$|Europe's {{towns and}} cities remain its primary source of wealth {{creation}} and the centre of its social and cultural development. However there are rising problems relating to rapid economic adjustments. It is clear that new efforts are necessary to strenghten or restore the role of Europe's cities as places {{of social and cultural}} integration, as sources of economic prosperity and sustainable development, and as bases of democracy" ["Towards an urban agenda in the European Union", European Commission, 1997]. The environment of cities has become increasingly competitive and complex. Cities need to anticipate and respond quickly to opportunities and threats that influence their position structurally. Although city governments develop policies and strategies to meet the challenges, at the same time higher layers of government pursue policies that influence the position of cities. National governments draw up financial and policy frameworks and create conditions in which cities have to manoeuvre and design their own policies. At the European level the interest for the strategic position of cities within regional development policy is growing. This harmonises with a major objective of the association of large European cities ('Eurocities') to bring the position of the large cities as engines of economic growth {{and at the same time}} as concentrations of social problems to the attention of the Europan Commission. Although the Commission recognises the important role of cities for European regional development, until now <b>European</b> <b>urban</b> policy <b>initiatives</b> have been blocked by a majority of national governments, as a consequence of the principle of subsidiarity. The objective of our contribution is to compare current developments as far as explicit national urban policies in the member states are concerned. However the scope will not be limited to explicit policies alone. National policies with a substantial impact on urban development will be dealt with too. The framework for the investigation is made up of four parts. The first two parts compare national urban patterns and structures (the urbanisation pattern and the administrative structure), while the remaining parts deal with the questions: (1) what do national authorities consider to be main issues for, and challenges to their (larger) cities?; and (2) how do national governments respond to these issues and challenges by policies targeted to the role and function of cities? The results of our investigation into current national urban policies are for an important part based on fifteen national case studies produced by colleagues from each of the member states according to the framework mentioned before. This contribution summarises the results of the comparison. The results might give ingredients for a future urban policy at the European level. ...|$|R
