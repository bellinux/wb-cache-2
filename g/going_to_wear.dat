5|$|Carly Beth Caldwell is a naive, timid and gullible 11-year-old {{girl who}} is afraid of pretty much everything. Thus, she is a {{constant}} target for pranks, jokes and tricks, most of them being inflicted on her by Steve Boswell and Chuck Greene at Walnut Avenue Middle School. In the opening chapter, Carly Beth and Sabrina discuss what costumes they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> for Halloween, and Carly Beth is tricked by Steve into eating a sandwich containing a live worm. Horrified, Carly Beth flees and vows revenge. After school, she goes home and finds her mother has made her a silly duck costume for Halloween, and also a very realistic plaster of Paris model of Carly Beth's head. When she goes to her room, the duck costume seemingly comes alive and attacks Carly Beth. It turns out it is her younger brother, Noah, playing another trick on her. Sabrina calls, and they discuss the school science fair.|$|E

With the Flyers, Schenn was given the opportunity to play alongside his younger brother Brayden, saying, [...] "It’s going to be exciting to play with my brother, that’s for sure. I can’t describe how cool this is." [...] On June 28, 2012, it was announced that Schenn was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> number 22 for the Flyers, as his usual number 2 was retired from the team in honour of defenceman Mark Howe.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} said the idea of wearing masks stemmed from a clown mask that Crahan took to rehearsals when the band first started. Crahan later became known for his clown masks, {{adopting}} the pseudonym [...] "Shawn the Clown". The concept developed; by late 1997, the band decided every band member would wear a unique mask and matching jumpsuit. Taylor said in 2002, [...] "it's our way of becoming more intimate with the music. It's a {{way for us to}} become unconscious of who we are and what we do outside of music. It's a way for us to kind of crawl inside it and be able to use it." [...] The concept of wearing matching jumpsuits {{has been described as a}} response to commercialism in the music industry and led to the idea of assigning the band members numerical aliases. According to Taylor, [...] "Originally, we were just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> the jumpsuits...we figured we might as well take that further and number ourselves...We were basically saying, 'Hey, we're a product!'".|$|E

500|$|Alec Mapa of The Advocate elaborates: [...] "While {{the rest}} of us were sleeping, Cher's been out there for the last four decades living out every single one of our {{childhood}} fantasies... Cher embodies an unapologetic freedom and fearlessness that some of us can only aspire to." [...] Rolling Stone Jancee Dunn wrote, [...] "Cher is the coolest woman who ever stood in shoes. Why? Because her motto is, 'I don't give a shit what you think, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> this multicolored wig.' There are folks all over America who would, in their heart of hearts, love to date people half their age, get multiple tattoos and wear feathered headdresses. Cher does it for us." [...] Alexander Fury of The Independent wrote that Cher [...] "represents a seemingly immortal, omnipotent, uni-monikered level of fame." [...] Bego stated: [...] "No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's. She has been a teenage pop star, a television hostess, a fashion magazine model, a rock star, a pop singer, a Broadway actress, an Academy Award-winning movie star, a disco sensation, and the subject of a mountain of press coverage." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the first}} ever SummerSlam, The Mega Powers teamed up against André the Giant and Ted DiBiase, The Mega Bucks with Savage's former tag-team partner Jesse [...] "The Body" [...] Ventura as the special guest referee. Most of the pre-match {{build-up}} centered on Elizabeth, who by this time was {{at the peak of}} her popularity. The tease for the match was that if things got bad, Elizabeth, billed as the secret weapon of The Mega Powers, was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> sexy red panties under her fancy clothes. Towards the end of match, André and Dibiase were in control, so Elizabeth got up on the apron and ripped her skirt off to reveal her underwear which distracted André, Dibiase and Ventura, giving Savage and Hogan time to recover after being knocked out of the ring. The Mega Powers quickly took advantage of the situation and won the match after Ventura made a reluctant three-count (Savage rode Ventura's arm down to the mat to finalize the count).|$|E

Her image and fashion has changed several times with different hairstyles since the release of her third album. She commented that as a child she [...] "used to watch her [...] get dressed" [...] and that her love and admiration for fashion started with her mom. When putting together her own wardrobe she stated, [...] "It's become more about taking a risk ... I always look for the most interesting silhouette or something that's a little off." [...] Jess Cartner-Morley of The Guardian wrote that [...] "Rihanna's wardrobe is the most talked-about, influential and dissected in pop right now" [...] and that whatever she wears [...] "is immediately reproduced on the high street, because it sells". Country singer Miranda Lambert admires Rihanna's fashion and style stating, [...] "I don't necessarily get inspired by the whole no-bra thing, but I love that you never know what she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear.</b> It always keeps you guessing, which makes her sassy and interesting." ...|$|E

2500|$|The character's [...] "scantily clad" [...] attire {{has been}} commented {{on in the}} British tabloid press, with Tony Stewart from [...] the Daily Mirror {{suggesting}} that Gemma Bissix might [...] "turn up in Albert Square starkers next". In May 2008, Clare was shown dressed as Princess Leia, and according to Stewart she looked like [...] "a porno version" [...] of the Star Wars character, [...] "in white hot pants and a skimpy top that [...] her galactic orbs to bounce about". In {{an article in the}} Daily Mail, the journalist suggested that the character had quickly made a name for herself [...] "thanks to her plunging necklines and knee-high boots [...] dressed in a tight, short silver dress and fishnet tights [...] her love of fitted clothes has attracted the attention of many of Albert Square's male residents." [...] Commenting on her character's revealing clothing, Bissix has said, [...] "I wasn't aware {{she was going to be}} so scantily clad. I knew she was going to be a minx but not that she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> so little so often. Samantha Janus [...] told me she was in low-cut tops all the time when she started so I think it's a bit of an initiation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lynsey {{gets back}} into Silas's [...] "bad books" [...] {{when he finds}} her looking at his {{hospital}} records. Silas then tries to scare Lynsey off with a menacing warning. In August 2011, Rawle confirmed that Silas would start terrorising Lynsey. Rawle explained that Silas is intent on discrediting Lynsey as she knows he is a killer. He said [...] " [...] job {{over the next few}} weeks, it's like a war of attrition - [...] <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>wear</b> her down and send her mad." [...] Lynsey is determined to see Silas punished for his crimes as the investigation into India's murder gathers pace. Of this, Hassan told Inside Soap [...] "When Silas realises that Lynsey is on his case again, he basically tells her to bring it on." [...] Silas [...] "gets off" [...] on the idea that Lynsey is trying to stop him from killing again and Hassan said [...] "it makes the game a lot more interesting". Lynsey's suspicions are reconfirmed when she sees Silas among the press at a televised appeal about India's attacker. Lynsey frames Silas by planting India's necklace on him before ringing the police anonymously. Hassan said that Lynsey hopes Silas's [...] "web of lies" [...] will unravel. Lynsey's attempt to frame him backfires.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{his title}} loss to Naomichi Marufuji, Akiyama made good his promise <b>to</b> Tsuyoshi Kikuchi, <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> <b>wearing</b> blue trunks, and wrestling {{mainly in the}} undercard.

In the fall of 2004, Diamond {{made a name for}} himself in an obscure Instructional League game during which he tripped and fell on the mound while attempting a pickoff move. The opposing Oakland A's prospects laughed at Diamond, who then walked off the mound towards the A's dugout and told them that the next person <b>to</b> laugh was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>wearing</b> a fastball in the temple. Diamond then threw his next pitch three feet behind the hitter at the plate and then delivered nine consecutive strikes to punch out the side.|$|R

According to Faramarznameh, after the death of Rostam, the suit was passed to his son, Faramarz.|$|R
