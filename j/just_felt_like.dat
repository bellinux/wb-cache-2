500|$|In August that year, Harrison {{set off for}} {{a driving}} holiday around Europe without Boyd, a trip that Huntley {{describes}} as [...] "the first publicly visible signs" [...] of problems in the Harrisons' marriage. While in Portugal, Harrison stayed with his musician friend Gary Wright, who, Huntley suggests, [...] "play the diplomat" [...] by telling the press: [...] "He's writing lots of new things {{and he seems to}} be having a good time...

500|$|Screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, who {{had worked}} on the two {{previous}} Transformers films, declined to return for the third film, with Kurtzman declaring that [...] "the franchise is so wonderful that it deserves to be fresh, all the time. We <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> we'd given it a lot and didn't have an insight for where {{to go with it}} next". Revenge of the Fallens co-writer Ehren Kruger became the sole screenwriter for Dark of the Moon. Kruger had frequent meetings with Industrial Light & Magic's (ILM) visual effects producers, who suggested plot points such as the scenes in Chernobyl.|$|E
500|$|During the 1992 season, Ripken and the Orioles {{tried to}} work out a new contract. Several times {{throughout}} the season, Ripken endured batting slumps. He said after the season, [...] "I don't like to make excuses for the fact that I wasn't hitting, but I was distracted... I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the Orioles were playing mind games with me. Whether that was right or wrong, it was bothering me." [...] On August 22, Ripken finally signed a five-year, $30.5 million contract, the largest in baseball history at the time. Ripken's slumps continued, and he was even booed by Orioles' fans late in the season. He finished the year batting [...]251 with career-lows in home runs (14) and RBI (72). The Orioles contended for the playoffs much of the year, not getting eliminated until September 27. However, he did win his second Gold Glove Award.|$|E

[...] She elaborated, [...] "I was really affected by the suicides that have been happening, having been subject to very public hatred [...] I have absolutely no idea how these kids felt. What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are. Every weird thing about you is beautiful and makes life interesting. Hopefully the song really captures that emotion of celebrating who you are ... I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> people hate because they don't understand or they're jealous, It's all coming from a very negative place and I really feel like people don't need to pay attention to that." ...|$|E
500|$|David Packard of DVD Verdict {{said that}} the live action scenes [...] "add to the silliness." [...] He also said [...] "It's a nice change of pace to see Plankton and Krabs as chums pre-Chum Bucket and finding out what led to their friendship's {{eventual}} demise. Viewers also get to see Mr. Krabs introduced to 'the love of his life' as he develops the secret formula to the Krabby Patty that Bikini Bottom's residents know and love today." [...] On the DVD, Patrick Cossel of Blogcritics said [...] "Children and adults will laugh out loud at the crazy slapstick antics {{of the one who}} lives under the sea." [...] He added that [...] "This release is sure to be huge hit for SpongeBob fans everywhere." [...] Lesley Aeschliman of Yahoo! Voices was negative on the episode saying [...] "'Friend of Foe?' <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a regular episode that really had no reason to be hyped a special." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} and {{commercial}} success of [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in 2010, Eminem wanted to record an alternative version with Rihanna {{as the lead}} vocalist, viewing aspects of a relationship from a female perspective, unlike the original, which featured Eminem as lead vocalist and was from a male perspective. In an interview for MTV, Rihanna initially stated she was against recording a sequel: [...] "When I first heard the idea about doing a part two, I was just completely against it. I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> you couldn't beat the 'original'. There's {{no way you can}} outdo that, so why compete with it?". She said when she first heard the original demo of the song in the studio with Eminem, sung by American singer-songwriter Skylar Grey, her reservations about recording it went away. While the demo was only accompanied by a piano, Rihanna and her team added drums and later vocals from Eminem.|$|E

500|$|Carter openly wept in {{the locker}} room after the game and was {{affected}} so badly by the loss that he considered retirement. [...] "Walking off that field and losing like that," [...] Carter reflected, [...] "I didn't even know if I wanted to play football anymore. Because I <b>just,</b> I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> that I would never win after that." [...] He went on to call the game, [...] "The most devastating loss that I've ever been a part of." [...] Both Carter and fellow Hall of Fame member Randle believed that the 1998 Vikings team was their best chance at winning a Super Bowl; neither player would ever reach the Super Bowl in their careers.|$|R

500|$|After {{being dropped}} by Columbia, the band {{set off to}} Brazil to support All Time Low in January 2011. They {{subsequently}} began recording their fifth studio album with producer and longtime friend Ed Ackerson at his studio, Flowers Studio, in Minneapolis. The band recorded on their own time with their own resources, which both provided comfort {{and a sense of}} nervousness to the group. They did not sit down and preconceive the album as a change in style, but rather relaxed and took their time writing it. [...] "We <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was like we were just taking our time and just kinda living life and not worrying about too much other than getting together and making music," [...] remarked Taylor. Pierre has since looked back on Go with mixed emotions, citing it as his personal least favorite album by the band. He noted that he was struggling with dark thoughts and felt that the band's collective misery translated to the record.|$|E
500|$|One of {{the songs}} they worked together, [...] "It's You", {{was said to be}} one of the album's centerpiece, with Malik commenting: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I needed to put myself out there, just because it was a form of therapy for me and it did help me get through some shit. If I can help someone else at that time, that’s cool." [...] Dan Hyman from [...] Pitchfork Media stated that the song shared {{similarities}} with Ocean’s [...] "Bad Religion", with Ho mentioning that after hearing the song live and Zayn's fans noting similarities between both songs, he found them similar with the organ. [...] "It's You" [...] premiered during Zane Lowe's Beats One Radio on 25 February 2016, and a day later, 26 February 2016, it was released as the first promotional single from Zayn's debut solo studio album Mind of Mine (2016), along with the pre-order of the album on the iTunes Store.|$|E
500|$|In a June 2011 Kerrang! interview, Lee {{said that}} the album would be self-titled and was [...] "about the band; it's more of a band record." [...] Lee {{explained}} that the concept [...] "to me is about falling back {{in love with this}} thing, with Evanescence, with what I've obsessed over for a decade, longer than that." [...] There were originally many album-title ideas, but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative [...] "it <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> this is who we are, it's a band. And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up, it was just the only title that felt right. It's about falling back in love with this thing in a major way." [...] In an MTV News interview, she said that 16 songs had been recorded but not all would be included on the album. It was later decided to release two versions of the album: a deluxe edition with all 16 songs and a standard edition with 12.|$|E

I'm actually very thankful that it is the tiny little small town that it IS, because it made me wanna get the heck OUTTA there! You know, from a very young age I always knew that I wanted to go somewhere else! And so that in turn became the reason why I started my journey and what ultimately led me to London and making this album!

500|$|One of {{the first}} non-Nordic Viking metal bands was the German project Falkenbach. Formed in 1989 and {{primarily}} the work of front-man Vratyas Vakyas, Falkenbach performs a mixture of black metal and folk music, with lyrics drawing from Western and Northern European mythologies, religions, and folk traditions. The Dutch bands Heidevolk, Slechtvalk, and Fenris have also been labeled as Viking metal, though Heidevolk's former vocalist Joris Boghtdrincker claims that Heidevolk has never tried to [...] "play the Viking card or the Pan-Germanic card", instead choosing to write about local Dutch history. The Swiss band Eluveitie jokingly calls its music [...] "the new wave of folk metal", which vocalist Chrigel Glanzmann explains was because the [...] "whole folk metal thing was still quite new back then, and the scene and the music press was looking for new labels {{for that kind of}} music, so they came up with Forest Metal, Viking Metal, Heathen Metal, Pagan Metal, blah blah blah, and we <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was really really ridiculous." ...|$|E
500|$|Other reviews {{were more}} mixed, or simply {{referred}} to the episode as [...] "decent". Jill Mader from InsidePulse called the episode [...] "decent" [...] noting that [...] " [...] season has been shaping up." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic noted that the episode was not a [...] "fantastic episode of The Office, but it had its funny moments, and that's what I tune in for." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote [...] "Doomsday" [...] was not [...] "a terrible episode by any means [...] the various pieces never fell into place, and the resolution didn't feel {{as though it was}} earned by the episode that came before it. It <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> it was trying to do too much too quickly, never quite narrowing in on character in the midst of manufacturing chaos." [...] McNutt ultimately gave the episode a B-. Despite some of the more mixed reviews, a large majority of critics found the cold-opening humorous, with many noting that it was the best of the season so far.|$|E
500|$|Piliero had {{the concept}} nearly {{finished}} {{by the time}} he met with Spears. Both wanted to explore fun ways for Spears to be inappropriate in the video, who had several ideas, such as a cop frisking her. Having seen Spears on How I Met Your Mother and Saturday Night Live, Piliero felt that none of her videos had really taken advantage of her comedic timing, saying, [...] "She never had a music video where she could show her acting chops and have fun with comedy while being super badass. That was my goal from day one: I wanted her to be funny, badass and super cool.". During {{the first day of the}} shoot, he requested Spears to [...] "have as much fun as possible over these next two days". Pilliero also stated that the Crossroads (2002) reference [...] "s a fun Easter egg for fans. Plus, [...] is the most ridiculously awesome way to title a sequel. It <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the right thing to do. When Britney saw it, she loved it." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics {{agreed that}} the scenes with the Dothraki were strong, with the storyline having {{improved}} significantly since the first episodes. Poniewozik stated that [...] "this was the first week for me that the Dothraki scenes were not <b>just</b> absorbing but <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the characters were as well-imagined as those in Westeros," [...] and McNutt felt the episode [...] "finally allows Khal Drogo to become an actual character." [...] Drogo's rant vowing to give his unborn son the Iron Throne led to compliments about Jason Momoa's intensity and Emilia Clarke's calm and loving facial expressions.|$|R
5000|$|Another incident, which was, allegedly, {{partially}} {{witnessed by}} {{the editor of}} a [...] "Ladies' Journal", is said to have occurred in Wallachia in the 1770s. He had been present in Arad when 27 robbers had been impaled. It was strictly forbidden to give the impaled persons any water, but one woman took mercy on one of the robbers, and fetched water for him in a kettle. As she was glancing anxiously about to check if anyone took notice of her forbidden act of mercy, the robber smashed her head in with the kettle, killing her on the spot. The editor avers he was present when the robber was asked why he had done such a thing, and he merely replied he had done it on a whim, and <b>just</b> had <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> killing her then and there.|$|R
5000|$|During the tournament, Niederreiter and Nazem Kadri {{attracted}} {{attention for}} Kadri's refusal {{to shake hands}} with Niederreiter after their semi-final game. Kadri did not elaborate on the specifics of what caused his refusal, but did absolve Niederreiter of using an ethnic slur, [...] "Obviously, in big games like that, guys tend to lose their composure a bit, but I didn't take offence to anything he said. It was <b>just</b> that I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> I didn't have to shake his hand." [...] Kadri later had second thoughts about his refusal, [...] "I regret it a little bit." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{comparing}} work on Batman Forever, Chris O'Donnell, who portrayed Robin, explained, [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> everything got {{a little}} soft the second time. On Batman Forever, I felt like I was making a movie. The second time, I felt like I was making a kid's toy commercial." [...] He also complained of the Robin costume, saying it was more involved and uncomfortable {{than the one he}} wore in Batman Forever, with a glued-on mask which caused sweat to pool on his face. According to John Glover, who played Dr. Jason Woodrue, [...] "Joel [...] would sit on a crane with a megaphone and yell before each take, 'Remember, everyone, this is a cartoon'. It was hard to act because that kind of {{set the tone for the}} film." [...] Production designer Barbara Ling admitted her influences for the Gotham City design came from [...] "neon-ridden Tokyo and the Machine Age. Gotham is like a World's Fair on ecstasy." [...] Rhythm and Hues and Pacific Data Images created the visual effects sequences, with John Dykstra and Andrew Adamson credited as the visual effects supervisors.|$|E
500|$|Most of the album's lyrics {{were written}} by Static, from the R band Playa. While the band was growing apart, he was invited by Blackground to be a lead writer for the album after writing [...] "Are You That Somebody?" [...] and [...] "Try Again". Static {{was a part of}} Aaliyah's close group of friends, which {{included}} Missy Elliott and Timbaland, and shared an infatuation with her. He found Aaliyah to be ideal for his songwriting style, while she believed that he could accurately portray her feelings. A subtly sexual lyricist, he wrote [...] "Rock the Boat" [...] for her in 1999, but Blackground felt she was not ready for the song. Barry Hankerson said of his songwriting, [...] "We always were protective over every lyric... But he did things where you never felt offended. You <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> you overheard someone thinking... he was clever... Aaliyah depended on him [...] he depended on her." [...] Elliott said that he was [...] "a part of that bridge of Aaliyah growing up lyrically". While she discussed the lyrics with Static, Aaliyah consulted Bud'da about the sound and musical direction of the album. She was interested in learning about the UK garage scene at the time.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were positive. Dan Forcella from TV Fanatics {{gave the}} episode a mixed review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of five. Forcella noted [...] "It has been four episodes now since the super team {{returned}} from Florida, and The Office still hasn't found its footing back in Scranton", {{and he called}} the outing [...] "another lackluster effort". [...] A review from CliqueClack was largely critical of the episode, calling it [...] "worse than usual" [...] and noting that the show had finally hit [...] "rock bottom". WhatCulture! Reviewer Joseph Kratzer felt that the episode's setting—outside of the office building—was detrimental to the episode. He wrote, [...] "The thing is, I in no way felt like any of what occurred in 'Fundraiser' needed to take place outside the Scranton branch and that’s really why a sitcom should move locations for an episode – because the story couldn't function without it. But this time it <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> a cheap way to liven up a clearly very boring, uninspired, weak episode of television." [...] Screen Crave wrote, [...] "Those viewers of The Office that have scolded the show throughout the season for its varying degrees of sucking, {{are not likely to}} be changing their thinking after watching the latest episode." ...|$|E
500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are. When {{asked about the}} {{background}} of lead single [...] "First Time", Wade said, [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>felt</b> urgent, <b>like</b> a first kiss, a first love. [...] Like {{the first time you}} realize there's more to that relationship than you thought. I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself at a place where I can write stuff that's a little deeper than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|R
5000|$|IGN's Robert Canning {{gave it a}} 6.9/10 {{saying that}} [...] "the episode had a good start, but veered into a less than {{impressive}} direction and Marge's storyline, while cute in parts, was really just filler more than anything else". Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave it a B, the second highest score of the night after American Dad. He said: [...] "Not a bad setup for an episode, particularly as Bart's shenanigans {{are one of the}} few things the show does consistently anymore, but it <b>just</b> never <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> the Andy and Bart story ever went anywhere". Jason Hughes, of AOLTV said [...] "This was a pretty well-structured episode, in that it might even give Bart some hope and direction for his own life...It adds something to the character of Bart to have an older prankster in town, whether he's successful or not." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, Griffin toured with Emmylou Harris, Buddy Miller, Gillian Welch and David Rawlings as the Sweet Harmony Traveling Revue. On February 6, 2007, she {{released}} Children Running Through. The album debuted at number 34 on the Billboard 200, with 27,000 copies sold. Of the album, Griffin told Gibson Lifestyle, [...] "I <b>just</b> kind of <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> singing what I wanted to sing, and playing how I wanted to play. It's not all dark and tragic. It's {{a different way}} for me to look at things. Getting old—older, I should say, I'm not so serious all the time." [...] It was also said that the album was inspired by her childhood.|$|R
