5|$|Caracciola {{was carried}} on a chair to the local tobacco shop, and from there {{he went to the}} hospital. He had {{sustained}} multiple fractures of his right thigh, and <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> doubted he would race again. He transferred to a private clinic in Bologna, where his injured leg remained in a plaster cast for six months. Caracciola defied the predictions of <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> and healed faster than expected, and in the winter Charlotte took her husband back to Arosa, where the altitude and fresh air would aid his recovery.|$|E
5|$|However, in 1801 he fell ill, {{contracting}} Yellow Fever. He {{was sent}} to sea by <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> {{in an attempt to}} regain his health but died aboard HMS Tisiphone in September 1801.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{underwent}} surgery in November 1995 to treat an aneurism that <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> believed had {{been caused by}} the poisoning. Before the surgery, he submitted blood samples to Johnson County's crime lab {{to be tested for}} ricin antibodies.|$|E
50|$|However, Lundager still {{struggled}} {{to recover from}} the illness prompting <b>his</b> <b>doctor</b> to suggest that he consider seeking a warmer climate. Taking <b>his</b> <b>doctor's</b> advice, Lundager decided to emigrate to Australia.|$|R
50|$|We {{cut back}} to the police lecture. The two {{policeman}} go on duty where they stop a speeding motorist (Mr. Legendre) who is rushing to see <b>his</b> <b>doctor.</b> Mr. Legendre is eventually told by <b>his</b> <b>doctor</b> that he has cancer and offered a cigarette, he slaps <b>his</b> <b>doctor</b> and returns home. Once home, he tells his wife that nothing is wrong with him. They receive a phone call informing them that their daughter has disappeared from school.|$|R

5|$|Chopin {{made his}} last public {{appearance}} on a concert platform at London's Guildhall on 16 November 1848, when, {{in a final}} patriotic gesture, he played {{for the benefit of}} Polish refugees. By this time he was very seriously ill, weighing under 99 pounds (i.e. less than 45kg), and <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> were aware that his sickness was at a terminal stage.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Malvern Hill on 1 July 1862, Brandon's {{ankle joint}} {{was struck by}} a ball. As he fell, his hand hit a rolling shell which did not explode. Oblivious to his wounds, Brandon tried to rise again but he fell once more and {{remained}} on the field until men were able to pick him up and carry him to the rear. Because there was no visible bleeding, Brandon thought that his injuries were not serious but was taken on horse-back to a hospital. Initially, Brandon was offered whiskey which would have eased the pain, but he refused to drink it without water and sugar. He drank it only after being convinced it was necessary. Brandon's foot was removed after a torniquet was put in place. Brandon's arteries were then sewn in what was likely to be a very painful procedure, as there was not enough choloroform to produce a full anesthesia. To replace his amputated leg, <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> gave him a wooden prosthetic leg. Because of Brandon's age, <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> thought his chances of survival were slight. After coming to Richmond, he was tended to by friends and his servant. Confederate President Jefferson Davis even offered Brandon the hospitality of his mansion in the city.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009, Yao {{discussed}} the injury with <b>his</b> <b>doctors,</b> and the Rockets {{applied for a}} disabled player exception, {{an exception to the}} NBA Salary Cap which grants the injured player's team money to sign a free agent. The Rockets were granted the exception, and used approximately $5.7million on free agent Trevor Ariza. After weeks of consulting, it was decided that Yao would undergo surgery in order to repair the broken bone in his left foot. He did not play the entire 2009–10 season.|$|E

5|$|Prokofiev's latest opera projects, {{among them}} his {{desperate attempt to}} appease the {{cultural}} authorities, The Story of a Real Man, were quickly cancelled by the Kirov Theatre. The snub, in combination with his declining health, caused Prokofiev to progressively withdraw from public life and from various activities, even his beloved chess, and increasingly devote himself to his own work. After a serious relapse in 1949, <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> ordered him to limit his composing to an hour a day.|$|E
5|$|A {{couple of}} months into the season, Johnson {{suffered}} a prolapsed disc in his back; the condition was initially treated with injections, but surgery was eventually required as a lasting solution, though it would keep him out for an extended period. However, his recovery took longer than expected {{and it was not}} until the end of the season that Johnson was able to start running again, delaying any comeback until at least the start of the 2006–07 season. That comeback failed to materialise, and in September 2006, Johnson retired from professional football on the advice of <b>his</b> <b>doctors,</b> with his sights now set on coaching.|$|E
5|$|Around this time, {{developments}} in chemotherapy offered some hope for Ruth. The doctors {{had not told}} Ruth that he had cancer because of his family's fear that he might do himself harm. They treated him with teropterin, a folic acid derivative; {{he may have been}} the first human subject. Ruth showed dramatic improvement during the summer of 1947, so much so that his case was presented by <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> at a scientific meeting, without using his name. He was able to travel around the country, doing promotional work for the Ford Motor Company on American Legion Baseball. He appeared again at another day in his honor at Yankee Stadium in September, but was not well enough to pitch in an old-timers game as he had hoped.|$|E

5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} {{approached in}} 1939, Beecham was advised by <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> {{to take a}} year's break from conducting, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate, leaving the orchestra in other hands. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure {{the future of the}} orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra, helping its members to form themselves into a self-governing body.|$|E
5|$|As his sixtieth {{birthday}} approached, Beecham {{was advised}} by <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> {{to take a}} year's complete break from music, and he planned to go abroad to rest in a warm climate. The Australian Broadcasting Commission had been seeking for several years {{to get him to}} conduct in Australia. The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. Before leaving, Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra and helped its members to form themselves into a self-governing company.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic but is still not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> initially predicted.|$|E

5|$|Betances' {{last days}} were chaotic, {{not only because}} of the events in the Caribbean, but also because of what {{happening}} in his own household. Jiménez' mental state is reported as dubious by then. Some even suggest that she had become an alcoholic (probably) or even a morphine addict (unlikely) by then, and she even wished for her husband to die in tantrums reported by <b>his</b> <b>doctors.</b> Political foes attempted to gain possession of Betances' intelligence dossiers, as did Spanish intelligence agents in Paris. Betances asked personal friends to keep personal guard of him, which they did until he died.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1950s Waugh was troubled {{on a number}} of fronts. He was afflicted with writer's block, and was unable to make {{progress}} with his current novel, the second in his Sword of Honour trilogy. He had financial worries, a legacy of his free-spending post-war habits combined with accumulated tax liabilities and a lack of remunerative productivity. His general health was poor; he suffered from toothache, sciatica and rheumatism, and his memory was faulty. He was also drinking heavily, the effects of which were aggravated by a large intake of chloral and bromide washed down with crème de menthe—a treatment for insomnia that he concealed from <b>his</b> <b>doctors.</b>|$|E
5|$|He {{then went}} to the Presidential Palace in central Yogyakarta, where the {{government}} leaders were discussing an ultimatum which stated that the city would be stormed unless the leadership accepted colonial rule. Sudirman urged that the president and vice-president leave the city and fight as guerrillas, actions they had previously promised, but this suggestion was rejected. Although <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> forbade it, Sudirman received permission from Sukarno to join his men. The central government evacuated to the Kraton Ngayogyakarta Hadiningrat at the urging of Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, but were captured and exiled.|$|E

5|$|Later in 1857, FitzGerald {{resigned}} from Parliament {{on the advice}} of <b>his</b> <b>doctors,</b> and also decided not to seek re-election as provincial Superintendent. Robert Heaton Rhodes offered a requisition to Brittan to make himself available for the by-election that would result from FitzGerald's resignation from Parliament in the Lyttelton electorate, but Brittan replied that he could not absent himself from his private affairs as yet; Parliament at that time met in Auckland, and the 1858 session lasted from 10 April to 21 August, which required an absence from home for several months. Instead, Crosbie Ward, the editor and proprietor of the Lyttelton Times, was the only person nominated on 28 May 1858 and was thus declared elected.|$|E
5|$|The 1stbattalion of the Green Howards {{transferred}} {{early in}} 1942 to Ranchi in India, where the climate badly affected Verity's health. After suffering from dysentery, he was weak and <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> wished {{to send him}} home. However, he resumed his position and, {{by the end of}} the year, his battalion was sent to Persia. In March 1943, the battalion was posted to Kibrit Air Base in Egypt for training and then to Qatana in Syria. Here, preparations were finalised for the Allied invasion of Sicily. Verity remained below peak fitness and was struggling a little owing to his age. His commanding officers planned to withdraw him from front-line fighting and move him to a staff position at headquarters once the Sicily campaign had concluded.|$|E
5|$|The first {{reports of}} Arafat's failing health by <b>his</b> <b>doctors</b> for what his {{spokesman}} {{said was the}} flu came on 25 October 2004, after he vomited during a staff meeting. His condition deteriorated in the following days. Following visits by other doctors, including teams from Tunisia, Jordan, and Egypt—and agreement by Israel {{to allow him to}} travel—Arafat was taken to France on a French government jet, and was admitted to the Percy military hospital in Clamart, a suburb of Paris. On 3 November, he had lapsed into a gradually deepening coma.|$|E
