5000|$|The dumping of {{unwanted}} production surpluses onto {{the world market}} through export subsidies has depressed prices for many temperate agricultural commodities, with EU surpluses of exportable wheat a prime example. (Despite several Common Agricultural Policy reforms, domestic support for wheat - as measured by OECD producer support estimates - declined only marginally from an average 52% of gross <b>farm</b> <b>receipts</b> in 1986-88, to around 48% in 1998-2000. http://www.worldbank.org/prospects/gep2002/) The URAA has been relatively unsuccessful in disciplining export subsidies, with the proportion of subsidised exports in total exports increasing in many products of export interest for developing countries: for example for wheat, from 7% in 1995 to 25% in 1998. The cost to developing country production and exports is considerable, and only partially offset by the lower food prices available to NFIDC consumers. This form of transfer from high-income country taxpayers to low-income consumers is in any case rather inefficient, and the lower prices may harm production for local consumption even in NFIDCs. Agricultural reform as a whole, including the removal of export subsidies, would only result in quite small price rises for developing-country consumers.|$|E

5000|$|In Canada, {{the number}} of [...] "family farms" [...] cannot be {{inferred}} closely, {{because of the nature}} of census data, which do not distinguish family and non-family farm partnerships. In 2011, of Canadaâ€™s 205,730 farms, 55.4 percent were sole proprietorships, 24.5 percent were partnerships, 17.4 percent were family corporations, 2.4 percent were non-family corporations and 0.3 percent were other categories. Because some but not all partnerships involve family members, these data suggest that family farms account for between about 72.8 and 97.3 percent of Canadian farms. The family farm percentage is likely to be near the high end of this range, for two reasons. The partners in a Canadian farm partnership are typically spouses, often forming the farm partnership for tax reasons. Also, as in the US, family farm succession planning can use a partnership as a means of apportioning family farm tenure among family members when a sole proprietor is ready to transfer some or all of ownership and operation of a farm to offspring. Conversion of a sole proprietorship family farm to a family corporation may also be influenced by legal and financial, e.g. tax, considerations. The Canadian Encyclopedia estimates that more than 90 percent of Canadian farms are family operations. [...] In 2006, of Canadian farms with more than one million dollars in annual gross <b>farm</b> <b>receipts,</b> about 62.5 percent were family corporations and 13.1 percent were non-family corporations.|$|E
40|$|This report {{proposes a}} {{methodology}} to express OECD indicators {{of support in}} real terms and establishes specific purchasing power parities for {{a broad range of}} commodities so as to compare developments in output volume and prices at an aggregate level. It analyses the evolution of prices, <b>farm</b> <b>receipts</b> and support to agricultural producers in real terms in OECD countries and a number of emerging economies. In the OECD area, support to producers decreased between 1986 and 2009, but two periods can be distinguished. Prior to 1999, the producer support estimate (PSE) in real terms decreased by 20 %, but as a percentage of <b>farm</b> <b>receipts</b> (%PSE), the reduction was only 2 percentage points as <b>farm</b> <b>receipts</b> also decreased in a context of falling world prices. Between 1999 and 2009, in a context of rising world prices and <b>farm</b> <b>receipts</b> the decline in both the %PSE and the PSE in real terms was more marked, and the gap between domestic prices and border prices was significantly reduced. This analysis has also been applied to seven additional countries for the period 1995 - 2007, including two that have since become OECD members (Chile and IsraÃ«l). Output growth was very strong in these countries with the exception of Russia and Ukraine, leading to higher <b>farm</b> <b>receipts</b> in terms of purchasing power. Support to producers declined in IsraÃ«l, Chile and South Africa, and increased in other countries, albeit moderately.

It also ranked fourteenth {{out of all}} the states with respect to agricultural exports with its top exports, fruits and vegetables, falling within the category of specialty crops. According to the USDA (2003), Florida's agricultural exports help to boost farm prices and income and supported approximately 17, 000 jobs both on and off farm in 2001, and as such are important to Florida's agricultural and statewide economy. From a Florida <b>farm</b> cash <b>receipts</b> perspective, increased imports could undermine revenue earnings from specialty crop production, especially if there is not a comparable growth in the exports of these crops. This report covered the period 1991 to 2002 and examined trade flows for selected specialty crops deemed important to Florida's agriculture. Overall, the US had a relatively high import level of the selected specialty crops. This was apparent from the widening trade gaps and the declining surpluses experienced by all commodities, with the exception of oranges and strawberries. CANMEX was the dominant supplier of vegetables, and growing imports from this group drove the growing vegetable trade deficit. With respect to fruits, CANMEX was also a dominant supplier and affected trade balances however, many of the declining fruit trade balances were due to declining exports to markets such as Asia and the Europe. CANMEX {{played a major role in}} the trade of foliage and floriculture but did not dominate the trade. Over the period 1991 to 2002 there were changes in the trade flows of the selected vegetables, fruits and foliage and floriculture. Two noticeable trends were the concentration of trade with CANMEX, especially with respect to vegetable exports, and declining exports to Asia and Europe. Also noticeable was declining trade balances experienced by the majority of the commodities in this study. Under free trade agreements, it becomes difficult to prevent the inflow of goods.
