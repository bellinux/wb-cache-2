Their report, Fitzroy Valley Alcohol Restriction Report: An evaluation {{of the effects of}} a restriction on take-away alcohol relating to measurable health and social outcomes, community perceptions and behaviours after a 12 month period, suggested that nearly all people surveyed on the impact of restrictions believed some type of limit on alcohol consumption was required, and none of them wanted their community to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> it was like before restrictions were introduced.|$|E

2500|$|The {{alternate}} {{version was}} leaked {{on the internet}} via Napster and other methods in the early 2000s, and was also played infrequently on some radio stations. According to then-member of the Boys' backing band, Tommy Smith, the album version is the [...] "original version"; the alternate version was recorded because the chorus of the album version did not make sense. In an interview with HitQuarters, Andreas Carlsson confessed that the song was a play with words. According to him, [...] "When Max {{came up with the}} original idea for the song, it already had the line 'you are my fire, the one desire'. We tried a million different variations on the second verse, and finally we had to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was sounding so great, 'you are my fire, the one desire'. And then we changed it to 'am I your fire, your one desire', which made absolutely no sense in combination with the chorus - but everybody loved it!." ...|$|E

2500|$|On March 4 Nagin {{appeared}} {{before an audience}} of New Orleans evacuees at an event organized by the NAACP, where he made the statement that [...] "there was {{all this talk about}} this being an opportunity to change New Orleans forever and maybe everybody shouldn’t come back, and maybe this is an opportunity to kind of change New Orleans and <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> it used to be. I have 23 candidates running for mayor and very few of them look like us. [...] There's a potential to be a major change in the political structure of New Orleans." [...] Some perceived these comments to be a divisive follow-up to his [...] "Chocolate City" [...] remarks, while others point out that the fact that Nagin is the only major African-American candidate in a field of 23 is a sign of the demographic shift in a city that was over two-thirds black before Katrina.|$|E
2500|$|The former {{trend in}} Disney's {{hand-drawn}} features where {{the characters and}} cinematography were influenced by a CGI-look has been abandoned. Andreas Deja, a veteran Disney animator who supervised the character of Mama Odie, says [...] "I always thought that maybe we should distinguish ourselves to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> 2D is good at, which is focusing on what the line can do rather than volume, which is a CG kind of thing. So we are doing less extravagant Treasure Planet kind of treatments. You {{have to create a}} world but [...] What we're trying to do with Princess and the Frog is hook up with things that the old guys did earlier. It's not going to be graphic...". Deja also mentions that Lasseter was aiming for the Disney sculptural and dimensional look of the 1950s: [...] "All those things that were non-graphic, which means go easy on the straight lines and have one volume flow into the other– an organic feel to the drawing." [...] Lasseter also felt that traditional animation created more character believability. For example, with Louis the alligator, created by Eric Goldberg, Lasseter said: [...] "It's the believability of this large character being able to move around quite like that." [...] Choreographer Betsy Baytos was brought by the directors to lead a team of eccentric dancers that gave reference to make each character a different style of movement. The character design tried to create beautiful drawings through subtle shapes, particularly for most characters being human. For the frog versions of Tiana and Naveen, while the animators started with realistic designs, they eventually went for cutesy characters [...] "removing all that is unappealing in frogs", similar to Pinocchios Jiminy Cricket.|$|E

60|$|He was not {{a believer}} in ghosts, but he came nearer to a fear of the dark that night {{than ever before in}} his life.

60|$|Thinking it {{was easy}} to tickle him while he {{continued}} in this mood, I began making any number of feeble jokes--feeble, but quite as good as the one which had provoked such outrageous merriment--for it amused me to see him acting in this unusual way. But they all failed of their effect--there was no hitting the bull's-eye a second time; he would only stare vacantly at me, then grunt like a peccary--not appreciatively--and walk on. Still, at intervals he would <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> I had said about hitting a very big bird, and roar again, as if this wonderful joke was not easily exhausted.|$|E

60|$|This {{book of the}} Proverbs is {{so called}} because it is such as containeth hard, dark, and pithy {{sentences}} of wisdom, by which is taught unto young men knowledge and discretion (1-6). Wherefore this book is not such as discloseth truths by words antecedent or subsequent to the text, so as other scriptures generally do, but has its texts or sentences more independent; for usually each verse standeth upon its own bottom, and presenteth by itself some singular thing to the consideration of the reader; so that I shall not need to bid my reader <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> went before, nor yet to that which follows, for the better opening of the text; and shall therefore come immediately to the words, and search into them for what hidden treasures are contained therein.|$|E
60|$|In {{several ways}} his {{opinions}} were totally changed, {{and would never}} <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> they were before, but the main structure of his character was not changed, {{and could not be}} changed. One or two very important features of it were altered, and in time effects would result from this, if opportunity offered--effects of a quite serious nature, too. Under the influence of a great mental and moral upheaval, his character and his habits had taken on the appearance of complete change, but after a while with the subsidence of the storm, both began to settle toward their former places. He dropped gradually back into his old frivolous and easygoing ways and conditions of feeling and manner of speech, and no familiar of his could have detected anything in him that differentiated him from the weak and careless Tom of other days.|$|E

The things which thou hast taught him be above his station, and the hopes and ambitions they inspire will but make his end the bitterer for him.

60|$|Now, having {{told you}} that bit of truth, I will <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> the Greeks thought. They said that Deucalion had a son whose name was Hellên, and that he again had three sons, called Æolus, Dorus, and Xuthus. Æolus {{was the father of}} the Æolian Greeks, and some in after times thought that he was the same with the god called Æolus, who was thought to live in the Lipari Islands; and these keep guard over the spirits of the winds—Boreas, the rough, lively north wind; Auster, the rainy south wind; Eurus, the bitter east; and Zephyr, the gentle west. He kept them in a cave, and let one out {{according}} to the way the wind was wanted to blow, or if there was to be a storm he sent out two at once to struggle, and fight, and roar together, and lash up Neptune’s world, the sea. The Æolians did chiefly live in the islands and at Corinth. One of the sons of Æolus turned out very badly, and cheated Jupiter. His name was Sisyphus, and he was punished in Tartarus—Pluto’s world below—by having always to roll a stone up a mountain so steep that it was sure to come down upon him again.|$|E
5000|$|After {{seeing a}} pre-release {{screening}} of the film, James Cameron voiced his support for Terminator Genisys. Describing it as respectful to the first two films, Cameron said he felt like [...] "the franchise has been reinvigorated". Michael O'Sullivan of The Washington Post enjoyed the film: [...] "Genisys <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> made the franchise work in the first place: not the machine inside the man, but vice versa". Richard Lawson of Vanity Fair also gave a positive review, writing that the film [...] "makes a surprisingly compelling case" [...] for itself. Mark Hughes of Forbes called many of the negative reviews a result of [...] "cynical nostalgia" [...] which [...] "distrusts change and anticipates failure", calling the review-aggregator ratings [...] "ridiculously and undeservedly low".|$|R
5000|$|Whereas the band's major label debut, Introduction to Mayhem, boasted strong hip hop tendencies, (the) New Release {{demonstrated}} a broader variety with bluesy vocals, saxophone, and piano scattered throughout.

All the plastic bands that were put together by record companies, etc. I didn't {{want to hear any}} of that music any longer... So I didn't... I <b>went</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>what</b> was real <b>to</b> me and <b>what</b> made me feel good growing up... Sabbath, Zeppelin, and Kiss...
