5|$|<b>Gene</b> <b>transfer</b> between species {{includes}} {{the formation of}} hybrid organisms and horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer.</b> Horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki bean weevil Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E
5|$|Horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>{{transfer}}</b> {{refers to}} the transfer of genetic material through a mechanism other than reproduction. This mechanism is a common source of new genes in prokaryotes, sometimes thought to contribute more to genetic variation than gene duplication. It is a common means of spreading antibiotic resistance, virulence, and adaptive metabolic functions. Although horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> is rare in eukaryotes, likely examples have been identified of protist and alga genomes containing genes of bacterial origin.|$|E

5|$|In {{ordinary}} circumstances, transduction, conjugation, {{and transformation}} involve transfer of DNA between individual bacteria {{of the same}} species, but occasionally transfer may occur between individuals of different bacterial species and this may have significant consequences, such as the transfer of antibiotic resistance.

5|$|Classification {{seeks to}} {{describe}} the diversity of bacterial species by naming and grouping organisms based on similarities. Bacteria can be classified {{on the basis of}} cell structure, cellular metabolism or on differences in cell components, such as DNA, fatty acids, pigments, antigens and quinones. While these schemes allowed the identification and classification of bacterial strains, it was unclear whether these differences represented variation between distinct species or between strains of the same species. This uncertainty was {{due to the lack of}} distinctive structures in most bacteria, as well as lateral <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> between unrelated species. Due to lateral <b>gene</b> <b>transfer,</b> some closely related bacteria can have very different morphologies and metabolisms. To overcome this uncertainty, modern bacterial classification emphasises molecular systematics, using genetic techniques such as guanine cytosine ratio determination, genome-genome hybridisation, as well as sequencing genes that have not undergone extensive lateral <b>gene</b> <b>transfer,</b> such as the rRNA gene. Classification of bacteria is determined by publication in the International Journal of Systematic Bacteriology, and Bergey's Manual of Systematic Bacteriology. The International Committee on Systematic Bacteriology (ICSB) maintains international rules for the naming of bacteria and taxonomic categories and for the ranking of them in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria.|$|E

40|$|International audienceAbstract. Type I polyketide synthases (PKSI) are modular multidomain enzymes {{involved}} in the biosynthesis of many natural products of industrial interest. PKSI modules are minimally organized in three domains: ketosynthase (KS), acyltransferase (AT), and acyl carrier protein. The KS domain phylogeny of 23 PKSI clusters was determined. The results obtained suggest that many horizontal <b>transfers</b> of PKSI <b>genes</b> have occurred between actinomycetales species. Such <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> may explain the homogeneity and the robustness of the actinomycetales group since <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> between closely related species could mimic patterns generated by vertical inheritance. We suggest that the linearity and instability of actinomycetales chromosomes associated with their large quantity of genetic mobile elements have favored such horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background While eukaryotes {{primarily}} evolve by duplication-divergence expansion (and reduction) {{of their}} own gene repertoire with only rare horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfers,</b> prokaryotes appear to evolve under both gene duplications and widespread horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> over long evolutionary time scales. But, the evolutionary origin of this striking difference {{in the importance of}} horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> remains by and large a mystery. Hypothesis We propose that the abundance of horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> in free-living prokaryotes is a simple but necessary consequence of two opposite effects: i) their apparent genome size constraint compared to typical eukaryote genomes and ii) their underlying genome expansion dynamics through gene duplication-divergence evolution, as demonstrated by the presence of many tandem and block repeated genes. In principle, this combination of genome size constraint and underlying duplication expansion should lead to a coalescent-like process with extensive turnover of functional genes. This would, however, imply the unlikely, systematic reinvention of functions from discarded genes within independent phylogenetic lineages. Instead, we propose that the long-term evolutionary adaptation of free-living prokaryotes must have resulted in the emergence of efficient non-phylogenetic pathways to circumvent gene loss. Implications This need for widespread horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> due to genome size constraint implies, in particular, that prokaryotes must remain under strong selection pressure {{in order to maintain the}} long-term evolutionary adaptation of their "mutualized" gene pool, beyond the inevitable turnover of individual prokaryote species. By contrast, the absence of genome size constraint for typical eukaryotes has presumably relaxed their need for widespread horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> and strong selection pressure. Yet, the resulting loss of genetic functions, due to weak selection pressure and inefficient gene recovery mechanisms, must have ultimately favored the emergence of more complex life styles and ecological integration of many eukaryotes.

5|$|Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a soil {{rhizosphere}} bacterium, can {{attach to}} plant cells and infect {{them with a}} callus-inducing Ti plasmid by horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer,</b> causing a callus infection called crown gall disease. Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Today, genetic modification of the Ti plasmid {{is one of the}} main techniques for introduction of transgenes to plants and the creation of genetically modified crops.|$|E
5|$|Complicating {{factors include}} {{claims that the}} {{relationship}} between eukaryotes and the archaeal phylum Crenarchaeota is closer than the relationship between the Euryarchaeota and the phylum Crenarchaeota and the presence of archaea-like genes in certain bacteria, such as Thermotoga maritima, from horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer.</b> The standard hypothesis states that the ancestor of the eukaryotes diverged early from the Archaea, and that eukaryotes arose through fusion of an archaean and eubacterium, which became the nucleus and cytoplasm; this explains various genetic similarities but runs into difficulties explaining cell structure. An alternative hypothesis, the eocyte hypothesis, posits that Eukaryota emerged relatively late from the Archaea.|$|E
40|$|Recent {{accumulation}} of microbial genome data {{has demonstrated that}} lateral <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> constitute an important and universal evolutionary process in prokaryotes, while those in multicellular eukaryotes are still regarded as unusual, except for endosymbiotic <b>gene</b> <b>transfers</b> from mitochondria and plastids. Here we thoroughly investigated the bacterial genes derived from a Wolbachia endosymbiont on the nuclear genome of the beetle Callosobruchus chinensis. Exhaustive PCR detection and Southern blot analysis suggested that ∼ 30 % of Wolbachia genes, {{in terms of the}} gene repertoire of wMel, are present on the insect nuclear genome. Fluorescent in situ hybridization located the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> on the proximal region of the basal short arm of the X chromosome. Molecular evolutionary and other lines of evidence indicated that the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> are probably derived from a single lateral transfer event. The <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> were, for the length examined, structurally disrupted, freed from functional constraints, and transcriptionally inactive. Hence, most, if not all, of the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> have been pseudogenized. Notwithstanding this, the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> were ubiquitously detected from Japanese and Taiwanese populations of C. chinensis, while the number of the <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> detected differed between the populations. The <b>transferred</b> <b>genes</b> were not detected from congenic beetle species, indicating that the transfer event occurred after speciation of C. chinensis, which was estimated to be one or several million years ago.

5|$|Indeed, the endosymbiotic {{theory for}} {{the origin of}} organelles sees a form of {{horizontal}} <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> as a critical step {{in the evolution of}} eukaryotes such as fungi, plants, and animals.

It had been suggested in the late 19th century when similarities between mitochondria and bacteria were noted, but largely dismissed until it was revived and championed by Lynn Margulis in the 1960s and 1970s; Margulis was able to make use of new evidence that such organelles had their own DNA that was inherited independently from that in the cell's nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors.

Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals.

5|$|Their genome {{is usually}} a {{circular}} bacterial chromosome – a single loop of DNA, although they can also harbor small pieces of DNA called plasmids. These plasmids can be transferred between cells through bacterial conjugation. Bacteria have an enclosing cell wall, which provides strength and rigidity to their cells.

However, many bacterial species can transfer DNA between individual cells by a horizontal <b>gene</b> <b>transfer</b> process referred to as natural transformation. Some species form extraordinarily resilient spores, but for bacteria this is a mechanism for survival, not reproduction.
