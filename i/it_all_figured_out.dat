For months, fans have speculated on how the character might tie to the comics, but this premiere offers little hint beyond the fact that he doesn't appear to be inherently evil thus far. Then again, neither did many other of Gothams now-regular villainous figures. So we'll see what the future holds for emo Bruce." ...|$|E
