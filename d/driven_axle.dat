40|$|Keywords-drive axle housing; shell element; solid element; {{finite element}} analysis; stress Abstract. The {{finite element model}} of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing was built by using the solid element and the shell element respectively. Vertical bend {{strength}} and stiffness under 2. 5 times of fully load of the <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing were calculated by finite element method. By comparing {{the results of the}} vertical bend strength and stiffness of both models, we could know that both of the two models can be used to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing. Because there were fewer elements of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing model based on shell element, the amount of final calculation was less. It is more feasible to analyze the whole stress situation of <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing by establishing <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> housing based on shell element...|$|R

50|$|The {{foremost}} axle on the {{tandem axle}} is powered. When fully loaded, the K-44 carries approximately 62% {{of the weight}} lying on the tandem axle. The rear, non-driven axle, {{is linked to the}} <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> through a simple sub-assembly consisting of 3.5 in wide and 1500 mm long leaf springs and rocker arms. When the torque delivered to the rear axle is increased, the mechanism automatically shifts vehicle weight away from the non-driven axle to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle,</b> improving traction when most needed. Additionally, more of the weight can be moved to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> manually using an electro hydraulic system. In order to reduce fuel consumption and tyre wear the non-driven rear axle can also be raised completely off the road/surface, if a third load-bearing axle is not needed because the vehicle is running empty: running on just two axles also reduces the K-44's turning circle.|$|E

50|$|Anglewinder {{is a type}} of slot car or {{motorized}} model car {{in which}} the motor shaft runs at an angle to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> (usually the rear) and drives it through a bevel or other angled gear arrangement. It is a development of the sidewinder, or transverse motor, in which the motor shaft is parallel to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> and power is transmitted through spur gears or a belt. The anglewinder arrangement allows use of a slightly longer motor than a pure sidewinder. It also moves the motor's weight forward in the car, which some racers believe improves handling.|$|E

50|$|A similar type of slot car {{which has}} the motor shaft mounted {{at an angle to}} the <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> is the Anglewinder. In general, the sidewinder and anglewinder are less common {{arrangements}} than the inline motor, in which the shaft is perpendicular to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle,</b> and drives it with bevel gears or a pinion and crown gear. Historically, they are also less common than the pancake motor, in which the shaft is vertical and power is carried to the axle by a chain of gears to a pinion and crown arrangement. Because they require more space between the drive wheels, the sidewinder and anglewinder arrangements are more common in 1:32, and especially 1:24, than in the smaller scales.|$|E
50|$|Sidewinder {{is a type}} of slot car or {{motorized}} model car {{in which}} the motor shaft is parallel to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> (usually the rear), and power is transmitted through spur gears or, sometimes, a belt, friction or even by direct drive.

50|$|In {{the model}} car hobby, an inline {{car is a}} type of slot car or other {{motorized}} model car in which the motor shaft runs lengthwise down the chassis, perpendicular to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> (usually the rear).

50|$|The {{electronic}} {{differential lock}} (EDL) employed by Volkswagen is not, {{as the name}} suggests, a differential lock at all. Sensors monitor roadwheel speeds across an individual <b>driven</b> <b>axle,</b> and if one wheel is rotating substantially faster than the other (i.e. slipping) the EDL system momentarily brakes it. This effectively transfers power to the other wheel.|$|E

50|$|A {{jackshaft}} is {{an intermediate}} shaft used to transfer power from a powered shaft {{such as the}} output shaft of an engine or motor to driven shafts such as the <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> of a locomotive. As applied railroad locomotives in the 19th and 20th centuries, jackshafts were typically {{in line with the}} <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> of locomotives and connected to them by side rods. In general, each <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> on a locomotive is free to move about one inch (2.5 cm) vertically relative to the frame, with the locomotive weight carried on springs. This means that if the engine, motor or transmission is rigidly attached to the locomotive frame, it cannot be rigidly connected to the axle. This problem can be solved by mounting the jackshaft on unsprung bearings and using side-rods or (in some early examples) chain drives.|$|R
