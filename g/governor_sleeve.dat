5000|$|In larger steam {{turbines}} an oil operated servo mechanism {{is used in}} order to enhance the lever sensitivity. The use of a relay system magnifies the small deflections of the lever connected to the <b>governor</b> <b>sleeve.</b> The differential lever is connected at both the ends to the <b>governor</b> <b>sleeve</b> and the throttle valve spindle respectively. The pilot valves spindle is also connected to the same lever at some intermediate position. Both the pilot valves cover one port each in the oil chamber. The outlets of the oil chamber are connected to an oil drain tank through pipes.The decrease in load during operation of the turbine will bring about increase in the shaft speed thereby lifting the <b>governor</b> <b>sleeve.</b> Deflection occurs in the lever and due to this the pilot valve spindle raises up opening the upper port for oil entry and lower port for oil exit. Pressurized oil from the oil tank enters the cylinder and pushes the relay piston downwards. As the relay piston moves the throttle valve spindle attached to it also descends and partially closes the valve. Thus the steam flow rates can be controlled. When the load on the turbine increases the deflections in the lever are such that the lower port is opened for oil entry and upper port for oil exit. The relay piston moves upwards and the throttle valve spindle ascend upwards opening the valve.The variation of the steam consumption rate ṁ (kg/h) with the turbine load during throttle governing is linear and is given by the “willan’s line”. The equation for the willan’s line is given by: ...|$|E

The objective of our investigation is modifying the Watt Governor (pendulum type) to increase minimum speed limit. [2] Generally we seen that watt governor is best suitable for 60 - 80 r. p. m minimum speeds only, in our study we extend lower arm and fly ball position of the watt governor to the downside from the intersection of link and arm, and then we derive the equation for governor speed. We fabricated the model of governor and observed effect of the extension of lower link and fly ball weight on minimum speed of the governor. This analysis carried out by extension of lower links of the governor and position of fly balls. Index Terms- Extension of lower links, position of fly balls, minimum speed of the <b>governor,</b> central <b>sleeve</b> load. I...|$|R
