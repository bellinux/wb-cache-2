5|$|The public roads {{from the}} Indianapolis corner to the Porsche Curves were re-surfaced. Run-off areas at the Dunlop Chicane, Tertre Rouge, Indianapolis, and Ford Chicanes were also {{partially}} asphalted {{in order to}} avoid gravel being brought back onto the circuit by cars which <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> course. This also increased safety by allowing the cars to slow themselves more efficiently using their brakes and tyres on tarmac.|$|E
5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} the right-hand side of the van, including three rows of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943 Graf Zeppelin {{was again}} towed eastward, first to Gotenhafen, {{then to the}} {{roadstead}} at Swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the Parnitz River, two miles (3km) from Stettin, {{where she had been}} briefly docked in 1941. There she languished {{for the next two years}} with only a 40-man custodial crew in attendance. When Red Army forces neared the city in April 1945, the ship's Kingston valves were opened, flooding her lower spaces and settling her firmly into the mud in shallow water. A ten-man engineering squad then rigged the vessel's interior with demolition and depth charges in order to hole the hull and destroy vital machinery. At 6pm on 25 April 1945, just as the Soviets entered Stettin, commander Wolfgang Kähler radioed the squad to detonate the explosives. Smoke billowing from the carrier's funnel confirmed the charges <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off,</b> rendering the ship useless to her new owners for many months to come.|$|E

He has taken the flat above the Sterrolls, and invites both couples to come and see it. The men decline, and Maurice escorts Julia and Jane to his flat. Presently the voices of all three are heard singing a sentimental love song; the husbands exchange panicked glances and rush upstairs.|$|R

5|$|On 4 March 1941, Pattle claimed three enemy Fiat G.50bis fighters (nos 22–24) {{belonging}} to 24oGruppo. He claimed the first, while Nigel Cullen — another leading fighter ace — flew as his wingman. Escorting Blenheims to attack Italian warships, the pair were engaged by a lone G.50. Pattle engaged the Fiat and shot it down — its landing gear dropped {{down and it}} rolled over and into a mountainside just north of Himare. Pattle searched for Cullen, expecting him to be behind him but saw {{no sign of the}} Australian. He assumed Cullen <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> to scout for more enemy aircraft after missing out on Pattle's victory. Now alone, he was attacked by another lone G.50bis while flying towards Vlorë. After a brief combat, he shot down the Fiat. It crashed into the sea southwest of Vlorë harbour. He then became involved with a third such fighter over Valona harbour and claimed to have shot this down into the sea in flames {{on the west side of}} the promontory. After his return to base, he was informed Cullen had been posted missing in action. Pattle and the squadron considered he had most likely been shot down and killed.|$|E
5|$|The Angel of Darkness started {{development}} {{three years}} prior to its release under the working title Tomb Raider next generation. As part of the preparation for the game, the company conducted market research, and decided {{to create a new}} setting and story for the main character. One of the main drives behind the game was fully utilising the new platform's potential and reinventing the character of Lara Croft, including rebuilding her character model and allowing her to perform melee combat. It was the first game in the series to be made for the PlayStation 2 platform: the previous entry in the series, , had pushed the PlayStation to its technical limits, contributing to lower review scores and sales than previous titles in the series. Core Design separated into two teams, with a new team working on Angel of Darkness and series regulars on Tomb Raider: Chronicles. After the completion of Tomb Raider: Chronicles, lead programmer Richard Morton came over and found that the new team <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> the rails, scrapping the entire project once already and completing only the game's basic story. The developers later admitted to being overambitious. Some of them also commented that none of the Core team were prepared for the added complexity of developing for the advanced PlayStation 2. Jonell Elliott returned as the voice of Lara Croft. This would be the last time she provided the voice, with Keeley Hawes taking over for Tomb Raider: Legend.|$|E
5|$|On the July 7 {{episode of}} SmackDown, it was {{announced}} that Lesnar would be facing Randy Orton at SummerSlam, who himself had just returned to WWE from injury. Two days later on July 9, WWE allowed Lesnar to have a one-off fight for UFC 200. Lesnar failed two of his drug tests for this fight, but he was not suspended by WWE because he is not a full-time performer. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Lesnar was the #5 draft pick for the Raw brand. Reports claimed that he would have been #1 had he not failed his UFC drug tests. Orton was drafted to SmackDown, thus making their match an interbrand match, while WWE billed their face-off as a match fifteen years in the making. Along with Heyman, Lesnar made his return to Raw on August 1 (his first appearance on WWE programming since WrestleMania 32), but during his segment Orton appeared and attacked Lesnar with an RKO. Lesnar then attacked Orton during his match the following night on SmackDown Live, performing an F-5 on Orton. At SummerSlam on August 21, Lesnar defeated Orton by technical knockout, leaving Orton with a forehead wound which required ten staples. Much to Shane McMahon's dismay, Lesnar would later attack Shane with an F-5. The end made many people believe Lesnar <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> script due to the severity of Orton's head wound. Lesnar was later storyline fined $500 for delivering an F-5 to SmackDown Commissioner Shane McMahon and his assault on Orton. On September 24 at a house show in Chicago, Illinois, Lesnar defeated Orton in a no-disqualification rematch, with the match being billed as a Suplex City death match.|$|E

Arrian says that after the fever had run for seven days, Alexander had to be summoned from the games to Hephaestion, who was seriously ill. He did not arrive in time; by the time he got there, Hephaestion was dead. Plutarch says that being a young man and a soldier, Hephaestion had ignored medical advice and as soon as his doctor, Glaucias, <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> to the theatre, he ate a large breakfast consisting of a boiled fowl and a cooler of wine, and then fell sick and died.|$|E

25|$|Terohaute's {{explanation}} was that Hood had been cleaning {{his gun and}} that it <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off,</b> shooting him through the head. The claim was self-evidently absurd; the rifle was too long {{for a man to}} shoot himself with, moreover Hood {{had been shot in the}} back of the head, apparently while reading a book. But with Terohaute stronger than them and armed, there was nothing John Hepburn and Richardson could do for the next three days, as Terohaute refused to let them out of his sight and became more and more aggressive, repeatedly asking to know if they thought he had murdered Hood. Finally, on 23 October, Terohaute left them for a short time to gather lichen. Richardson took the opportunity to load his pistol, and on Terohaute's return, shot him dead.|$|E

The opening {{partnership between}} Owais Shah and Ed Smith yielded 100 runs, Shah eventually making 79, and despite three wickets from Essex off-spinner James Middlebrook, Middlesex finished on 185 for 6 as Irfan Pathan hit two sixes to end with 21. Pathan then took three wickets inside 20 minutes, those of Alistair Cook, Ronnie Irani and Ravinder Bopara, and Essex were 45 for 5. James Foster made 62 not out at just the rate required to win, but Andre Adams could only hit at 7.5 an over as Essex finished on 154 for 7, 32 short of victory. Pathan had Adams caught near the end to finish with four for 27.|$|E
25|$|December 1808. Its new {{commander}} General Pedro de Alcántara Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duke of the Infantado {{allowed his}} soldiers to rest but {{was forced to}} execute three soldiers. One, a lieutenant had refused to march and positioned his artillery battery to fire on the troops who were obeying orders. The remnant of the 1st Division was sent home to Valencia province to recruit, while the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Divisions were reorganized into four divisions including a Vanguard and a Reserve. Many low-strength line regiments were consolidated from three battalions into one or two. Stragglers and reinforcements swelled the ranks. The soldiers' spirits rose when a brigade under General Conde de Alacha Lilli marched into camp, having escaped from Napoleon's armies. Hearing that the emperor <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> to the north, Infantado decided to launch an offensive toward Madrid before his reorganization was completed.|$|E

25|$|A heavy {{downfall}} of rain {{before the first}} race meant that the field began behind the safety car. The safety car came in {{at the end of}} the first lap, with polesitter Tarquini leading the pack. However, he drifted wide at Turn 2 through the gravel trap. This left Priaulx to lead until the end of the race, despite pressure from BMW teammate Jörg Müller. Despite dropping back after his off-track excursion, Tarquini came back through the field to finish in fifth behind Huff and Yvan Muller, ahead of SEAT teammates Gené and Monteiro. Farfus <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> at the same time as Tarquini on lap 3, but he fought his way through to finish eighth and securing pole position for Race Two after pushing Alain Menu wide on the penultimate lap, continuing his habit this season off recovering from early Race One incidents to finish eighth and start Race Two on pole.

25|$|At this time, the Hoyas {{borrowed}} {{a page from}} Villanova's offensive strategy and started running the four corners offense, with the hopes of causing the Wildcats to abandon their regular defense and shift to man-to-man coverage. The team's plan was foiled when a pass by Bill Martin deflected out of bounds off the shin of Broadnax. Under 30 seconds <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> the clock when the Wildcats regained the ball. Villanova resumed their ball-control offense, and took the lead with 2:37 remaining on a made shot by Jensen; the Wildcats had taken 62 seconds to run the play. Jensen's shot was the last attempted by Villanova in the game; all of the team's remaining points came on free throws. The Wildcats scored the next four points and were up 59–54 going into the final 84 seconds. Although the team was unsuccessful on multiple one-and-one free throw attempts, they added seven more points in the final portion of the game. The last made free throw, on the second of two attempts by Pressley, gave the Wildcats a 66–62 advantage with approximately 10 seconds on the clock. A shot by Michael Jackson brought the Hoyas to within two points in the closing seconds. Wingate stopped the clock from expiring by hitting {{the ball out of}} play with two seconds left. Jensen inbounded the ball to McClain, who had gone to the floor, and McClain kept possession until time expired and the Wildcats won the game and the Division I national championship, 66–64.|$|E
25|$|The Song of Dermot and the Earl and Expugnatio Hibernica {{follow the}} same pattern, portraying Derbforgaill’s {{abduction}} in 1152 and Mac Murchada’s banishment in 1166 as occurring at the same time. The Song claims that Derbforgaill {{had fallen in love}} with Diarmait, who in turn only made a pretense of loving her, in an effort to entice her away from Ua Ruairc, as a means of avenging previous wrongs inflicted by Leth Cuinn (the northern half of Ireland) upon Leth Moga (the southern half of Ireland). She subsequently arranged for a rendezvous from which he could carry her back to Laigin unchallenged. Ua Ruairc is then said to have complained to the (unnamed) king of Connacht, who convinced Mac Murchada’s allies to abandon him and force him into exile. In the events as narrated by the Song (and to a degree the Annals of Clonmacnoise and the Annals of the Four Masters) Derbforgaill is clearly a dupe, but in Gerald of Wales’s Expugnatio Hibernica she becomes more blameworthy:On an occasion when Ua Ruairc king of Meath <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>off</b> on an expedition to far distant parts, his wife, Ua Máelechlainn's daughter, whom he had left on an island in Meath, was abducted by the aforesaid Diramait, who had long been burning with love for her and took advantage of her husband's absence. No doubt she was abducted because she wanted to be and, since 'woman is always a fickle and inconstant creature', she herself arranged that she should become the kidnapper's prize.Almost all the world's most notable catastrophes have been caused by women, witness Mark Antony and Troy. King Ua Ruairc was stirred to extreme anger on two counts, of which however the disgrace, rather than the loss of his wife, grieved him more deeply, and he vented all the venom of his fury with a view to revenge. And so he called together and mustered his own forces and those of neighbouring peoples, and roused to the same purpose Ruaidrí, prince of Connacht and at that time supreme ruler of all Ireland. The men of Leinster, seeing that their prince was now in a difficult position and surrounded on all sides by his enemies' forces, sought to pay him back, and recalled to mind injustices which they had long concealed and stored deep in their hearts.. They made common cause with his enemies, and the men of rank among this people deserted Mac Murchada along with his good fortune... he finally trusted his life to the sea in flight, and so to speak had recourse to this last hope of saving himself.In addition to the classical references to Mark Antony and Troy, the quotation used by Gerald is from Mercury's pushing Aeneis to leave Dido and fulfill his fate by sailing to Italy, in the Aeneid.|$|E
