5|$|The {{final section}} of Highway416 travels {{parallel}} to Cedarview Road, which was relocated for the freeway. The Stony Swamp lies {{west of the}} route while farmland lies to the east. At {{the northern end of}} the swamp is an interchange with West Hunt Club Road. The freeway continues through a section of greenspace before descending <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> a trench. It passes beneath Bruin Road and the Ottawa Central Railway while traveling alongside Lynwood Village in Bells Corners. The highway is crossed by Baseline Road and Richmond Road; the former provides an onramp to southbound Highway416. The freeway ends at a large interchange with the Trans-Canada Highway, Highway417 (Exit131), just south of the Lakeview and Bayshore communities on the Ottawa River; downtown Ottawa is to the east and Kanata is to the west.|$|E
5|$|The {{landscape}} {{consists of}} {{the valley of the}} River Chew and is generally low-lying and undulating. It is bounded by higher ground ranging from Dundry Down to the north, the Lulsgate Plateau to the west, the Mendip Hills to the south and the Hinton Blewett, Marksbury and Newton St Loe plateau areas to the east. The valley's boundary generally follows the top of scarp slopes except at the southwestern and southeastern boundaries where flat upper areas of the Chew Valley grade <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> the Yeo Valley and eastern Mendip Hills respectively. The River Chew was dammed in the 1950s to create Chew Valley Lake, which provides drinking water for the nearby city of Bristol and surrounding areas. The lake is a prominent landscape feature of the valley, a focus for recreation, and is internationally recognised for its nature conservation interest, because of the bird species, plants and insects.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its decommissioning, Highway47 began at Highway48, and {{travelled}} east through a rural portion of Whitchurch-Stouffville along what is now York Regional Road40 (Bloomington Road), passing through rolling farmland. Only a decade prior, the highway travelled through the town of Stouffville along Main Street, then turned north along the Tenth line, following it to Bloomington Road and York - Durham Line, where it curved <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> the 1997 routing of the highway. The re-routing served to bypass this urban section.|$|E

25|$|One {{method to}} confirm that the bra is the best fit has been nicknamed the Swoop and Scoop. After {{identifying}} a well-fitting bra, the woman bends forward (the swoop), allowing their breasts to fall into the bra, filling the cup naturally, and then fastening the bra on the outermost set of hooks. When the woman stands up, she uses the opposite hand to place each breast <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> the cup (the scoop), and she then runs her index finger along the inside top edge of the bra cup to make sure her breast tissue does not spill over the edges.|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Bob Halligan {{released}} his album Window In The Wall under Atco Records. The only single {{released from the}} album was its lead track, [...] "Could've Been You", which Halligan had co-written with Arnie Roman. According to Halligan, Atco Records had been going through a [...] "political upheaval" [...] that year and his record [...] "was one of several recordings that was allowed to slip <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> the night". Halligan [...] "dryly notes, ' lasted three weeks at radio. It {{came out to the}} sound of one hand clapping'".|$|E
500|$|The {{proximity}} of trench lines {{made it easy}} for soldiers to shout greetings to each other, and this may have been the most common method of arranging informal truces during 1914. Men would frequently exchange news or greetings, helped by a common language; many German soldiers had lived in England, particularly London, and were familiar with the language and the culture. Several British soldiers recorded instances of Germans asking about news from the football leagues, while other conversations could be as banal as discussions of the weather or as plaintive as messages for a sweetheart. One unusual phenomenon that grew in intensity was music; in peaceful sectors, it was not uncommon for units to sing in the evenings, sometimes deliberately with an eye towards entertaining or gently taunting their opposite numbers. This shaded <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> more festive activity; in early December, Sir Edward Hulse of the Scots Guards wrote that he was planning to organise a concert party for Christmas Day, which would [...] "give the enemy every conceivable form of song in harmony" [...] in response to frequent choruses of Deutschland Über Alles.|$|E

2500|$|IDW Entertainment and Ideate Media {{have adapted}} Dirk <b>Gently</b> <b>into</b> an limited comic book series and, later, an American {{television}} series for BBC America.

2500|$|One other {{significant}} event in Short Brothers' history involved the Mussel. Eustace Short {{had come to}} fixed wing flying [...] quite late in life, and he learned on the Mussel I and continued on the Mussel II. One day he landed tidily on the Medway, but failed to turn the engine off, crossed the river and slid <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> the mud. It seems {{he died of a}} heart attack moments after touching down.|$|E
2500|$|Such words today seem commonplace, {{but when}} Brooks was writing it was commonplace for {{financial}} writers to simply pull corporate press releases off the wires and massage them <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> 'journalism.' Among {{the first of}} a new breed of financial journalist, unafraid to lift the manhole covers to peer underneath, Brooks's copy was, at the time, revolutionary. In his portrait of portfolio manager Gerry Tsai, for instance, Brooks described the go-go operator as [...] "so swift and nimble in getting into and out of specific stocks that his relations with them, far from resembling a marriage or even a companionate marriage, were often more like that of a roue with a chorus line." ...|$|E

50|$|Located on {{the southwestern}} shore of Lake Neuchâtel the village has a {{population}} of almost 2,500 which may rise to 7,000 in summer, due to the popularity of the sandy beaches, which <b>gently</b> shelve <b>into</b> the lake.|$|R
2500|$|Helena Mulkerns in Rolling Stone {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} five stars, calling it [...] "a rich mood piece of broad proportions" [...] and [...] "a glorious aural mosaic". The title track [...] "sails the {{listener}} <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> an ebb-and-flow movement that permeates the album" [...] that contains multi-vocals she described as [...] "distinctive" [...] and [...] "striking". She thought Roma's lyrics were [...] "unornamented but compelling", but its mutli-lingual touches [...] "enrich" [...] the listening experience without becoming too dominating. Kristine McKenna, in the Los Angeles Times, wrote a critical review who described it as [...] "a portentous pastiche that's drawn comparisons to ecclesiastical choir and Gregorian chant, but in fact sounds like nothing more than unusually windy New Age music" [...] which [...] "makes for bland, bloodless music ideal for elevators; this is a record about sound rather than lyrics, melody, {{or any of the other}} things that invest music with emotion and ideas." [...] In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett rated the album five stars out of five, writing that it [...] "established her as the unexpected queen of gentle, Celtic-tinged new age music" [...] with a subtlety that produced strong tracks as a result. Raggett concluded: [...] "It's a perfect combination of timelessness and technology, an appropriate end to this fine album".|$|E
2500|$|Tallulah Bankhead is {{regarded}} as one of the greatest stage actresses of the century, acclaimed for her natural eloquence and dynamism. [...] She excelled in both serious and comedic roles, and for over two decades, she was among the most celebrated actresses in Broadway or London's West End, praised in the superlative [...] "perhaps the greatest actress this country has ever produced." [...] For the most part, Bankhead was lauded even in her failed vehicles, and she was considered by critics to be a rare and unique talent. At the height of her career, she was a [...] "living legend", Broadway's most original leading lady. Her eccentric personality was an asset to her career rather than a hindrance, but as years of hard living took their toll, her highly publicized and often scandalous private life began to undermine her reputation of being a terrific actress. Her legend, which had once nourished her, nearly ruined her. The worst facets of her character were encouraged by her fans as virtues, and for the better part of her late career, she played to their caricature of herself. Obituaries on her passing reflected on how far she had fallen from her former grandeur, à la John Barrymore. The critic Brooks Atkinson was more candid: [...] "Since Miss Bankhead lived as she wanted to, there is no point in deploring the loss of a talented actress". However, Bankhead did not go <b>gently</b> <b>into</b> the night — the legend which had ruined her career made her an enormously popular icon in both the theatrical and particularly the gay community. Decades of sustained interest in Bankhead eventually realized itself in a renewed appreciation for her body of work — validating anew the artist behind the famous (or perhaps infamous) woman so far ahead of her time.|$|E

Strong storm-wave action erodes the seabed into low hummocks and swales that lack a specific orientation.|$|R
