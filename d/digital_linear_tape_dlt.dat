40|$|The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) was {{established}} by NASA {{to provide for the}} preservation and dissemination of scientific data from NASA missions. This paper describes the policies specifically related to lunar science data. NSSDC presently archives 660 lunar data collections. Most of these data (423 units) are stored offline in analog format. The remainder of this collection consists of magnetic tapes and discs containing approximately 1. 7 TB of digital lunar data. The active archive for NASA lunar data is the Planetary Data System (PDS). NSSDC has an agreement with the PDS Lunar Data Node to assist in the restoration and preparation of NSSDC-resident lunar data upon request for access and distribution via the PDS archival system. Though much of NSSDC's digital store also resides in PDS, NSSDC has many analog data collections and some digital lunar data sets that are not in PDS. NSSDC stands ready to make these archived lunar data accessible to both the research community and the general public upon request as resources allow. Newly requested offline lunar data are digitized and moved to near-line storage devices called <b>digital</b> <b>linear</b> <b>tape</b> jukeboxes. The data are then packaged and made network-accessible via FTP for the convenience of a growing segment of the user community. This publication will 1) discuss the NSSDC processes and policies that govern how NASA lunar data is preserved, restored, and made accessible via the web and 2) highlight examples of special lunar data requests...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 26 - 29, 1998 / Town & Country Resort Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaAs the {{performance}} of inexpensive commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) data storage devices continues to increase, the temptation to use them {{as the basis for}} data capture products for military and industrial applications becomes ever more compelling. For example, the <b>Digital</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Tape</b> (<b>DLT)</b> format now offers a 270 Gigabits per cassette capacity at a sustained transfer rate of 40 Mbits/s – performance which would have cost tens or even {{hundreds of thousands of dollars}} per system just a few years ago. But to transplant such a device from its benign office habitat into a data capture product which will function reliably and consistently in a wide range of field and platform environments is an engineering task fully as difficult and complex as designing an environmentally robust recorder from scratch. This paper discusses the problems which typically have to be overcome; environmental protection, reliability, data integrity, power supplies, software issues, control and data interfacing, etc., citing practical examples of analog and digital DLT-based data recorders which are now entering service for telemetry, intelligence gathering, anti-submarine warfare and related application...|$|E
40|$|The Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Version 0 (V 0) Distributed Active Archive Center (DAAC) {{has been}} {{developed}} to support existing and pre Earth Observing System (EOS) Earth science datasets, facilitate the scientific research, and test Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS) concepts. To ensure that no data is ever lost, each product received at GSFC DAAC is archived on two different media (VHS and <b>Digital</b> <b>Linear</b> <b>Tape</b> (<b>DLT)).</b> The first copy is made on VHS tape and is {{under the control of}} UniTree. The second and third copies are made to DLT and VHS media under a custom built software package named "Archer". While Archer provides only a subset of the functions available with commercial software like UniTree, it supports migration between near-line and off-line media and offers much greater performance and flexibility to satisfy the specific needs of a Data Center. Archer is specifically designed to maximize total system throughput, rather than focusing on the turn-around time for individual files. The Commercial Off the Shelf Software (COTS) Hierarchical Storage Management (HSM) products evaluated were mainly concerned with transparent, interactive, file access to the end-user, rather than as a batch-oriented, optimizable (based on known data file characteristics) data archive and retrieval system. This is critical to the distribution requirements of the GSFC DAAC where orders for 5000 or more files at a time are received. Archer has the ability to queue many thousands of file requests and to sort these requests into internal processing schedules that optimize overall throughput. Specifically, mount and dismount, tape load and unload cycles, and tape motion are minimized. This feature {{did not seem to be}} available in many COTS packages. Archer also [...] ...|$|E

The actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. The computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches took the early computers quite some time to process.|$|R

50|$|In {{some early}} {{prototype}} <b>linear</b> video <b>tape</b> recording systems {{developed in the}} early 1950s from companies such as Bing Crosby Enterprises, RCA, and the BBC's VERA, the tape speed was extremely high, over 200 in/s, to adequately capture {{the large amount of}} image information. The need for a high <b>linear</b> <b>tape</b> speed was made unnecessary with the introduction of the now-obsolete professional Quadruplex system from 1956, which segmented the fields of a television image by recording (and reproducing) several tracks at a high-speed across the width of the tape per field of video by way of a spinning headwheel with 4 separate video heads mounted on its edge (a technique called transverse scanning), allowing for the <b>linear</b> <b>tape</b> speed to be much slower. Transverse scanning was superseded by the later technology of helical scanning, which could record one whole field of video per helically-recorded track, recorded at an angle across the width of the tape.|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to evaluate the potential for clinical application of <b>digital</b> <b>linear</b> tomosynthesis in imaging hip prostheses. Volumetric x-ray <b>digital</b> <b>linear</b> tomosysnthesis was used to image hip prostheses. The tomosynthesis was compared to metal artifact reduction (MAR) computed tomography (CT), and non-MAR CT scans of a prosthesis case. The effectiveness of this method in enhancing visibility of a prosthesis case was quantified {{in terms of the}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and removal of ghosting artifacts in a prosthesis case was quantified in terms of the artifact spread function (ASF). In the near in-focus plane, the contrast is greater in the MAR CT or tomosynthesis relative to the non-MAR CT. The order of ASF performance of the algorithm was as follows: (1) tomosynthesis; (2) MAR-CT; (3) non-MAR CT. The potential usefulness of <b>digital</b> <b>linear</b> tomosynthesis for evaluation of hip prostheses was demonstrated.

40|$|We {{examine the}} issue of scaling {{magnetic}} tape-recording to higher areal densities, focusing on the challenges of achieving 100 Gb/in 2 in the <b>linear</b> <b>tape</b> format. The current highest achieved areal density demonstrations of 6. 7 Gb/in 2 in the <b>linear</b> <b>tape</b> and 23. 0 Gb/in 2 in the helical scan format provide a reference for this assessment. We argue that controlling the head–tape interaction is key to achieving high linear density, whereas track-following and reel-to-reel servomechanisms as well as transverse dimensional stability are key for achieving high track density. We envision that advancements in media, data-detection techniques, reel-to-reel control, and lateral motion control will enable much higher areal densities. An achievable goal is a linear density of 800 Kb/in and a track pitch of 0. 2 lm, resulting in an areal density of 100 Gb/in 2. A. J. Argumed...|$|R
