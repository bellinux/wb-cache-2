5000|$|Parts of the {{television}} crew {{are located in the}} first and largest part, the video production area. The television director, technical director, assistant director, character generator (CG) operator and television producers usually sit in front of a wall of video monitors. The technical director sits in front of the video switcher. The video monitors show all the video feeds from various sources, including computer graphics, professional video cameras, video tape recorder (VTR), video servers and slow-motion replay machines. The wall of monitors also contains a preview monitor showing what could be the next source on air (does not have to be depending on how the video switcher is set up) and a program monitor that shows the feed currently going to air or being recorded. The keyed dirty feed (with digital on-screen graphic) is what is actually transmitted back to the central studio that is controlling the outside broadcast. A clean feed (without the graphics) could be sent to other trucks for use in their production. The video switcher is usually operated by one person called the technical director (TD) and is responsible for switching the video sources to air as directed. Behind the directors there is usually a desk with monitors for the editors to operate. It is essential that the directors and editors are in communication with each other during events, so that replays and slow-motion shots can be selected and aired. The [...] "production room" [...] in most sporting events has a <b>graphics</b> <b>operator</b> and sometimes a font coordinator who are in charge of the graphics, statistics, and the showing of the names of commentators or the players to be shown on air.

We use a series of basic and composite <b>graphic</b> <b>operators</b> to complete signal perceptual transformation. The Monte Carlo contour detection method could overcome the dimensions problem of existing local filters. We also propose the enhanced mean shift method with estimation of spatial shape parameters.

The aim is to limit the concessions that conventional, in-house methods force <b>graphics</b> <b>operators</b> to make {{to the quality of}} the end products to get them on time and within budget. A reference architecture for distributed rendering is proposed that takes advantage of the parallel properties of the application to reduce the job turnaround time. Performance issues that stimulate the industrial sector to use the environment are discussed through a simplified evaluation framework. We also examine how to serve multiple customers in a metacomputing environment employing limited resources. User strategies for submitting jobs over a priority-based service system that minimize the associated rendering cost are defined. Furthermore, a pricing scheme is implemented that succeeds in driving the user actions to an operating point in which certain provider objectives are met and, at the same time, discourages the users from utilizing a congested system, in which meeting of deadlines cannot be assured. Results and directions are not only restricted to the post production area, but apply over a wide range of remote operations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. One of {{the most}} {{frequently}} occuring artifacts in ultrasound imaging is reverberations. These are multiple reflection echoes that result in ghost echoes in the ultrasound image. A method for reducing these unwanted artifacts using a three-dimensional (3 D) Wiener filter is presented. The Wiener filter is a global filter and produces an estimate of the uncorrupted signal by minimizing the mean square error between the estimate and the uncorrupted signal in a statistical sense. The procedure works as follows: In a <b>graphic</b> interface the <b>operator</b> is displayed an image sequence. The operator marks two areas in one of the images; one area which contains a typical reverberation artifact, and one area free from artifact. Using these areas to produce noise and signal estimates, a Wiener filter is created and applied to the sequence. The 3 D Wiener filters display excellent selection capabilities, and the developed method significantly reduces the magnitude of the reverberation artifact in the tested sequences. ...|$|R
40|$|The window-based stream join is an {{important}} operator in all data streaming sys-tems. It has often high resource requirements so that many efficient sequential as well as parallel versions of it were proposed in the literature. The parallel stream join op-erators recently gain increasing interest because hardware is {{getting more and more}} parallel. Most of these operators, however, are only optimized for processors with ho-mogeneous execution units (e. g., multi-core processors). Newly available processors with heterogeneous execution units cannot be exploited whereas such processors pro-vide typically a very high peak performance. In this paper, we propose an initial variant of a window-based stream join operator that is optimized for processors with hetero-geneous execution units. We provide an efficient load balancing approach to utilize all available execution units of a processor and further provide highly-optimized kernels that run on them.

40|$|One of {{the most}} common {{artifacts}} in ultrasound imaging is reverberations. These are multiple reflection echoes that register as coming from a deeper region than the depth of the interface that are causing them, and result in ghost echoes in the ultrasound image. A method to reduce these unwanted artifacts using a three dimensional (2 D + time) Wiener filter has been developed. Two sequences of iq-data, the least processed signal possible to retrieve from the ultrasound system (Vingmed System Five), have been used to test the method: One sequence on a tissue-mimicking agar gel phantom in which bars of glass simulating ribs give rise to reverberations, and one sequence on an open-chest pig with a strong reverberation from a water-filled rubber glove used as a medium between the heart and the transducer. The procedure works as follows: In a <b>graphic</b> interface the <b>operator</b> is shown the image sequence. In one of the frames two areas must be marked out; One area which contains a typical reverberation artifact, and one area which will represent an artifact free signal.

Una vez se adquieran los conocimientos necesarios, se propondrán una serie de prácticas para que los alumnos se vayan familiarizando con el {{software}} y hardware utilizados, de manera que, se irá subiendo el grado de dificultad hasta que puedan realizar una auténtica red VoIP por sí mismos. A parte de la realización de las prácticas, los alumnos deberán pasar una prueba de los conocimientos adquiridos al final de cada práctica mediante preguntas tipo test. Los sistemas elegidos para la implantación de una red VoIP en los módulos de laboratorio son: 3 CX System Phone y Asteisk-Trixbox. Los cuales, son capaces de trabajar mediante gestores gráficos para simplificar el nivel de dificultad de la configuración. 3 CX es una PBX que trabaja sobre Windows y se basa exclusivamente en el protocolo SIP. Esto facilita el manejo para usuarios que solo han usado Windows sin quitar funcionalidades que tienen otras centralitas en otros sistemas operativos. La versión demo activa todas las opciones para poder familiarizarse con este sistema. Por otro lado, Asterisk trabaja en todas las plataformas, aunque se ha seleccionado trabajar sobre Linux. Esta selección se ha realizado porque el resto de plataformas limitan la configuración de la IP PBX, esta es de código abierto y permite realizar todo tipo de configuraciones. Además, es un software gratuito, esto es una ventaja a la hora de configurar novedades o resolver problemas, ya que hay muchos especialistas que dan soporte y ayudan de forma gratuita. La voz sobre Internet es habitualmente conocida como VoIP (Voice Over IP), {{debido a}} que IP (Internet Protocol) es el protocolo de red de Internet. Como tecnología, la VoIP no es solo un paso más en el crecimiento de las comunicaciones por voz, sino que supone integrar las comunicaciones de datos y las de voz en una misma red, y en concreto, en la red con mayor cobertura mundial: Internet. La mayor importancia y motivación de este Proyecto Fin de Carrera es que el alumno sea capaz de llegar a un entorno laboral y pueda tener unos conocimientos capaces de afrontar esta tecnología que esta tan a la orden del día. La importancia que estas redes tienen y tendrán en un futuro muy próximo en el mundo de la informática y las comunicaciones. Cabe decir, que se observa que estas disciplinas tecnológicas evolucionan a pasos agigantados y se requieren conocimientos más sólidos. ABSTRACT. The objective of my final project during my studies in university was, to simulate and create a VoIP network over a data network in a teaching environment, more specifically {{on the subject of}} telecommunications networks and services in Telecommunication Engineering Degree in Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM). Once acquiring the necessary knowledge a number of practices were proposed to the students to become familiar with the software and hardware used, so that it would {{rise to the level of}} difficulty that they could make a real VoIP network for themselves. Parts of the experimental practices were that students must pass a test of knowledge acquired at the end of each practice by choice questions. The systems chosen for the implementation of a VoIP network in the laboratory modules are: 3 CX Phone System and Asteisk - Trixbox. Which were able to work with <b>graphics</b> <b>operators</b> to simplify the difficulty level of the configuration. 3 CX is a PBX that works on Windows and is based solely on the SIP protocol. This facilitates handling for users who have only used Windows without removing functionality with other exchanges in other operating systems. Active demo version all options to get to grips with this system. Moreover, Asterisk works on all platforms, but has been selected to work on Linux. This selection was made because other platforms limit the IP PBX configuration, as this is open source and allows all kinds of configurations. Also, Linux is a free software and an advantage when configuring new or solve problems, as there are many specialists that support and help for free. Voice over Internet is commonly known as VoIP (Voice Over IP), because IP (Internet Protocol) is the Internet protocol network. As technology, VoIP is not just another step in the growth of voice communications, but communications of integrating data and voice on a single network, and in particular, in the network with the largest global coverage: Internet. The increased importance and motivation of this Thesis is that the student is able to reach a working environment and may have some knowledge to deal with these technologies that is so much the order of the day. The importances of these networks have and will be of essences in the very near future in the world of computing and communications. It must be said it is observed that these technological disciplines evolve by leaps and bounds stronger knowledge required...|$|R
