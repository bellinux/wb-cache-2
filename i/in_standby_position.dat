5000|$|When Task Forces 51 and 53 {{dissolved}} {{and their}} ships reverted to Task Force 51, Hoel {{was assigned to}} Fire Support Section 3, Task Unit 51.17.3 (TU 51.17.3) of the Eniwetok Expeditionary Group. In the early morning darkness of 17 February 1944, Hoel reentered Eniwetok Lagoon with [...] to bombard Parry and Japtan Islands. Hoel picked up several aviators from a wrecked scout aircraft from [...] and returned them to their ship. That afternoon Hoels guns destroyed several small craft on the beach of Parry Island and fired on pillboxes and troop concentrations inland. She then anchored <b>in</b> <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> {{while the rest of}} the force bombarded the two islands. The next day, Hoel took her turn at providing harassing fire and at night illuminated the beaches and the reef to prevent enemy troop movements. Just before daybreak 19 February 1944, she took station off Eniwetok for close fire support of the initial landings. When relieved by [...] on 21 February 1944, Hoel steamed to a position off the deep entrance to Eniwetok Lagoon for patrol duty which continued until 26 February 1944, when she embarked a fighter director team from [...] and assumed duties of standby fighter director for the Eniwetok area. On 4 March 1944, 2 days later after the attack and occupation phase of Eniwetok was completed, the fighter-director team was transferred to , freeing Hoel to depart for Majuro for repairs.|$|E
30|$|In this study, we {{used the}} Fogarty balloon {{catheter}} to perform balloon tamponade very early by passing the catheter through the irrigation channel and put it <b>in</b> <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> ready for inflation to control any troublesome bleeding that may initiate during the biopsy. This helps to reduce the operative time and amount of irrigation and/or coagulation required to control bleeding from the tumor bed.|$|E

Initial coagulation is {{done over the}} tumor surface and in cases where tumor is enveloped by ependymal wall to access biopsy underneath the ependyma from within the tumor. A biopsy forceps is used to grasp tumor piece gently moving right and left exerting also a little twist during {{pull out of the}} forceps to remove biopsy specimen. At that moment, a French 3 Fogarty balloon catheter is passed through the irrigation channel and put <b>in</b> <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> to do balloon tamponade with inflation of the catheter in biopsy bed rapidly controlling bleeding before it could visually obscure the field. The biopsy steps could be repeated to ensure enough tissue submitted for examination. Skin is then closed in layers.|$|E
50|$|The 24th Special Cruiser Squadron {{departed}} Hiroshima Bay on 15 November 1941 under {{radio silence}} and blacked {{out at night}} to arrive <b>in</b> a <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> at Jaluit Atoll in the Marshall Islands. They departed Jaluit on 26 November 1941 to patrol the sea lanes between Australia, Samoa, Fiji, the United States, and the Panama Canal. The operational plan was for one ship to lie-to and drift while performing maintenance, as the other ship carried out a perimeter patrol searching for enemy shipping. The two ships would spend the hours of darkness within visual range; the ships then reversed roles the following day. Following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the search objective changed from avoiding detection to locating enemy commerce.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Cutting the cervix, morcellation, and {{extraction}} {{of the uterus}} and myomata remain major problems in endoscopic surgery. We developed an efficient, safe, reusable, and inexpensive instrument to cut the cervix and morcellate the uterus and myomata: the morcellator knife. INSTRUMENT: The morcellator knife is a classic lancet with an interchangeable blade, transformed into an endoscopic instrument that can be inserted easily through a 10 -mm-diameter trocar. The blade has an automatic retraction system and is set <b>in</b> the <b>standby</b> <b>position,</b> ensuring security. Cutting the cervix and uterine or myoma fragmentation are easy. The mass to be cut is held between two grasping forceps for easy cutting with the blade, under permanent visual control. After morcellation, {{extraction of}} the masses is performed through a posterior culdotomy. EXPERIENCE: We have used this morcellator knife in 54 subtotal hysterectomies and 16 myomectomies. There were no complications during the procedures. Morcellation lasted 3 - 14 minutes and involved {{the use of an}} average of two to three blades. CONCLUSION: The morcellator knife is a simple, safe, reusable, and inexpensive instrument with a low maintenance cost...|$|R

40|$|Simple {{multiband}} planar antenna for {{wireless communication}} applications is presented. The proposed antenna performs four resonant modes covering multibands of wireless standards, including LTE 700, GSM, DCS, PCS, UMTS, and LTE 2300 / 2500. Furthermore, it covers the ISM, WiMAX, and the WLAN bands. The {{geometry of the}} proposed antenna consists of a single FR 4 substrate where an open cavity fed by a coplanar U-shaped monopole is etched {{on one side and}} a short-circuited meander line in the opposite side. The cavity by its nature supports a wide range of higher frequencies, while its boundary that consists of a thin monopole resonates at 900 [*]MHz. The meander line in the opposite side supports the LTE 700 band. The operating bands ranges are (680 – 748 [*]MHz), (870 – 960 [*]MHZ), (1. 36 – 1. 59 [*]GHz), and (1. 71 – 2. 56 [*]GHz). The antenna size is 30 × 18 × 0. 8 [*]mm 3. The antenna not only has a compact size but also supports a low SAR radiation at all the operating frequencies. The proposed antenna is tested using the four recommended test positions of the CTIA association where the proposed antenna reveals good performance in all test cases in the presence of handset (keypad, battery, speaker camera, RF circuit, and LCD) in talking position, and <b>in</b> <b>standby</b> <b>position...</b>|$|E

A microcontroller module serves as a control center whose task includes both controlling motors and communicating with computer. A motor module serves to handle motors. 10 sensors, including their signal conditionings, are introduced to read the environment conditions of the equipment. LEDs are used to display these conditions. In order to facilitate the operators 2 ̆ 7 duty, communication via RS 232 is provided. The brachytherapy equipment can therefore be operated by using computer. Interface software is developed using C# language. To complete both mechanical and instrumentation systems performance, a safety system is developed {{to make sure that}} the safety for operator and patients from receiving excessive radiation. An interlock system is introduced to guard against abnormal conditions. In the worst case, a manual intervention by the operator is provided when all other means are failing to store the isotope source into the safe container. The tests showed good results. The prototype can send the isotope source to applicators. The isotope source can be positioned with an accuracy of ± 0. 5 mm and with a speed of 550 mm/second. These characteristics meet the design criteria. Received: 16 January 2013; Revised: 26 August 2013; Accepted: 29 August 201...|$|E

50|$|There is {{evidence}} that such large area solar concentrating installations can kill birds that fly over them. Near {{the center of the}} array temperatures can reach 550 oC which, with the solar flux itself, is enough to incinerate birds while further away feathers are scorched leading to the eventual death of the bird. Workers at the Ivanpah solar power plant call these birds “streamers,” as they ignite in midair and plummet to the ground trailing smoke. During testing of the initial <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> for the heliostats, 115 birds were killed as they entered the concentrated solar flux. After adjusting the <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> to not focus all the solar energy into a single point, during the following 6 months of operations, a total of 321 birds were killed. However newly developed technique is available to prevent further bird fatalities.|$|R

40|$|The {{division}} of Engineering Materials at Linköping University, department of Management and Engineering, conducted {{a research project}} concerning Fatigue life of thermal barrier coatings during 2009. During this project equipment to provoke these fatigue failure by rapidly heating and cooling test subjects in cycles, was ordered. Design and manufacturing of the equipment was handled internally at LIU. The equipment was built using a furnace that is lowered and raised over the table where the test subject is placed. To keep {{the temperature of the}} furnace a lid slides in place to close the downward facing opening of the furnace when it is in the raised position. On this door there is nozzle that is used to cooling of the test subject by air. To make sure that the equipment can work independently you need an automation controller that can evaluate if movement can occur without danger of collisions. The control system also needs to monitor that all elements are performed according to plan. This degree project is based on a modular system from OPTO 22 and includes the configuration of a PLC that will be supplied with logic and a user interface. The degree project resulted in a graphic interface in which a user can set desired values for different parameters and get information about current values for them. Using the interface the user could also start and stop the running of cycles. An analog interface consisting of a start and stop button is also handled in the project. Logic has been created and tested using simulations of incoming signals. During these tests it managed to transform the equipment from standby to starting position for running cycles, running cycles that can be adapted by the user and to put the equipment <b>in</b> <b>standby</b> <b>position</b> when the user want to power down the system. Apart from this there is also routines to monitor that movements is actually done according to plan and communicates with external systems capable of sending signals. A routine that both transform digital alarms and translate numerical values representing different choices to text messages in the graphic interface has been created...|$|E
