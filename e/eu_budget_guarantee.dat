40|$|The European Commission is {{currently}} drafting {{a proposal for}} a review of the <b>EU</b> <b>budget,</b> which could lead to its most significant reform to date. This paper proposes a method for restructuring the <b>EU</b> <b>budget,</b> based on a multidisciplinary approach. The insights of public sector economics, fiscal federalism, political science and the literature on the concept of "subsidiarity" are combined to assess which policies should be funded by the <b>EU</b> <b>budget,</b> and by how much. The resulting four complementary analyses are brought together into an eight-step chart, which is used to analyze in detail one area of policymaking - education policies - to assess whether it should be funded by the <b>EU</b> <b>budget.</b> Extending the analysis to the budget as a whole, the paper finds that the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> should be shared into five areas, each corresponding to an EU objective: economic growth, sustainable development, convergence of the EU economies, external security and internal security. <b>EU</b> <b>budget,</b> European Union, fiscal federalism, subsidiarity, EU competences...|$|R

The paper begins with a detailed theoretical explanation {{of the ways in which}} the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> is directly or indirectly affected by its revenues, structure and objectives.

Many Member States see the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> as an instrument able to support their individual economic recovery. This paper analyses {{the viability of the}} <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> to do this. The approach is a critical one. The paper is divided into three parts: first of them analyses the financial framework during 2007 - 2013 and its weaknesses connected to lack of flexibility, lack of focus on European priorities, severe delays and input over performance. A distinct part of the analysis is focused on the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> 2011 as the first budget voted under the Lisbon Treaty. Even that the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> 2011 draft was built based on an expenditures increase of 6. 2 %, the real final increase was only 2. 9 %. At least, the paper analyses the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> 2012 draft which will achieve 132. 7 billion Euros (4. 9 % greater than in 2011) and will be focused on the supporting of the European economy and the EU citizens. The main conclusion of the paper is that the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> is far away of being an instrument against the present global crisis.

It {{is a very}} broad topic, which needs to be narrowed down {{for the purposes of}} this thesis. After a short introduction into the fundamental terms the thesis focuses on a detailed analysis of revenue sources of the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> and on financial frameworks. Firstly, the thesis describes the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> in general in order to introduce the topic and understand related fundamental terms. Chapters dealing with setting an <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> and a budget process are followed by a detailed analysis of revenues and expenditure and financial frameworks. The aim of the thesis is to introduce the overall theory of the <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> and subsequently to analyze the long-term development of revenues and expenditure until today, i. e. June 30, 2014. Currently, there is a new multi-annual financial framework for the period of 2014 to 2020 in place, which has introduced certain changes to the sources of revenues as well as expenditure. Not all of the changes have been implemented yet but will become effective in the near future.

40|$|EU {{declares}} {{to provide}} support for the rural and poor regions of its member states. However, recent research shows that past <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> allocations (in EU- 15) {{can be attributed to}} measures of the distribution of voting power in the Council of Ministers deciding on the bulk of EU spending. A standard power measure alone can explain about 85 % of the variance of the past <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> shares, while, if stable coalition patterns among member countries are taken into account, power can explain at least 95 % of the budget allocation. In this paper we use such estimates to predict <b>EU</b> <b>budget</b> shares after the eastern enlargement. According to our estimates eastern enlargement has large effects on the budget receipts of the incumbent member states. Moreover, whether the voting rules are based on the Nice Treaty (NT) or the Constitutional Treaty (CT) makes a difference for most member states.
