40|$|In principle, an {{exhaust system}} {{influences}} the maximum output and {{characteristic of a}} two-stroke combustion engine. The {{first part of the}} contribution deals with the possibility of transformation in a maximum output and a range of exploitable speed values by means of the change of exhaust manifold length in exhaust pipe section. This knowledge covers an output curve variability of an <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> The second part of this contribution deals with the combustion product 2 ̆ 7 s temperature influence in an exhaust system for a maximum engine output and a range of exploitable speed. By increasing the combustion product 2 ̆ 7 s temperature in an exhaust system, the maximum engine output is reduced overall. There is the transfer of engine output to higher engine speed because the exhaust manifold length is short theoretically. That is why it is necessary to provide the optimum value of combustion products temperature in an exhaust system and so achieve maximum values of outgoing parameters...|$|E
40|$|In {{multi-stage}} engine design, it {{is difficult}} – or impossible – to design a rotating component free of resonance. But {{it is imperative to}} tune the interfered frequencies outside of the <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range,</b> in order to avoid high cycle fatigue. This dissertation develops a methodology for accomplishing this design task. The first part of the work presents an approach for tuning of a single natural frequency of a turbine blade subjected to excitation generated by unsteady pressure in the operating speed range. Structural perturbations are performed in a way that only the eigenvalue of choice changes significantly, while producing only small disturbances to the other natural frequencies that lie outside of the operating speed range. This design technique {{is referred to as the}} Guided Tuning of Turbine Blades method (GTTB). The second part of the work presents an approach on the tuning two adjacent excited frequencies of a bladed-disc such as an impeller which has two sets of blades of different chord lengths, namely long and splitter blades. Two solutions are presented. The first one involves the reduction of the inter-blade coupling through stiffening the disc structure followed by individual blade tuning. The second solution is based upon the eigenvalue veering or non-coalescent property of the asymmetric cyclic sector of the structure. Validated through test measurements, this work indicates that a 5 % to 10 % shift of the eigenvalues is achievable in order to avoid resonance as normally encountered in engineering practice...|$|E
40|$|During {{test and}} {{verification}} of the Norwegian Navy’s {{fast patrol boat}} KNM Storm some problems with the lift fan machinery have been experienced. The problem observed is that occasionally, triggered by the firing of the 76 mm cannon, the port fan diesel engine is set into vibrations. In order to investigate the possible causes and the transient dynamic behavior of the system, several models have been explained, built and simulated throughout the master thesis. The bond graph notation and the computer software program 20 Sim have been used. A non linear rigid body model of the diesel engine is built. The rigid body model is connected to {{a model of the}} complete drive train, including the fan load. Excitation models for the inertial force and moments from crank kinematics, counteracted torque loading of the fan, displacement of foundation and air pressure pulse propagation into the fan compartment are built and simulated. The eigenfrequency calculation of the rigid body (diesel engine and gear) has been reviewed. The inherit physical properties of the rigid body show that we can expect amplification and phase shifts in the frequency range of approximately 4. 5 - 25 Hz. Installing snubbers at the engine brackets may lead to increased transverse stiffness and eigenfrequencies within the diesel <b>engine</b> <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> A velocity pulse, in transverse direction based on SKF measurements, to the diesel engine and gear foundation, reveals a 0. 7 mm transverse displacement contribution of the diesel engine and gear at the center of gravity. The pseudo bond graph model of the air blast pressure pulse propagation from deck through the fan compartment reveals that the pressure pulse will flatten out, with a decrease in pressure amplitude and an increase in pulse length, at the fan volute intake. The effects on pressure pulse at fan inlet have been investigated. Disturbance in the fan inlet flow field by a pressure pulse causes a negative torque loading transient as well as a positive engine speed transient. This affects the inertial forces from crank kinematics excitation vector and the counteracting torque fan loading excitation vector, which results in a diesel engine displacement. The potential of diesel engine displacement from the counteracting torque loading is greater than the velocity pulse to the engine foundation. The governor engine speed set point has been given a 2 Hz oscillation at 2100 rpm. This results in a 2 Hz oscillation of the fan load, counteracted torque loading, displacement in y-direction and angular displacement around the x-axis. The 2 Hz transverse displacement of the diesel engine is in accordance with the observations by crewmembers and yard. We can also observe the phase delay between the engine speed regulator and the actual engine speed and fan load. In order to create a continuation of the oscillation, a phase difference of 180 degree is required. A further model implementation of the physical effects of the gas dynamic processes together with the actual speed governor properties and exact physical data of the diesel engine are needed in A non linear rigid order to possible recreate this phenomena, and increase the accuracy of the simulation results.    </p...|$|E

40|$|TutorialDuring {{operation}} of compressor trains by a {{variable speed drive}} system (VSDS), integer and non-integer harmonic currents are generated in the inverter. Via the electrical system of the inverter and the motor, an excitation torque is transferred across the motor air gap into the main mass of the motor rotor. The frequency of this excitation may cause torsional resonances. Due to the rapid increase in excitation frequency of integer harmonics, intersections with relevant torsional natural frequencies (TNFs) can in general be avoided within the <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range.</b> In contrast, the intersections of the noninteger harmonic excitation frequencies, also called interharmonics, with TNFs within the <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> may have an essential impact on the vibration behaviour of the rotating equipment. This aspect has to differentiate between two train configurations. The first are direct driven trains and the second, trains including an intermediate gear. For direct driven trains, only fatigue problems have to be considered. In trains with an intermediate gear, on top of that, interaction of torsional and lateral movement may {{have a negative effect}} on the lateral vibration behaviour of the gear rotors. The main focus of this publication is on a simple but effective method for turbo compressor applications that allows avoiding main resonances within the <b>operating</b> <b>speed</b> <b>range</b> caused by intersections of interharmonic excitations with relevant TNFs. This method is based on detailed knowledge of the inverter behaviour and possible design options of the motor itself. This in-depth understanding was developed by correlating numerical and experimental results based on dynamic torque measurements of real turbo compressor trains. During this investigation the mechanically relevant torsional excitations were identified. Therefore, the different types of inverters and their corresponding characteristics had to be analyzed and understood in detail. This knowledge, in combination with possible motor designs, with regard to the number of pole pairs and the most common train configurations (direct driven and/or trains including intermediate gears), is incorporated in this report...|$|R
