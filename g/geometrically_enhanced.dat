40|$|Abstract: Motivated by our {{experiences}} with spatial modelling for the sustainable land use initiative {{we present a}} <b>geometrically</b> <b>enhanced</b> ER model (GERM), which preserves the key principles of entity-relationship modelling {{and at the same}} time introduces bulk constructors and geometric features. The model distinguishes between a syntactic level of types and an explicit internal level, in which types give rise to polyhedra that are defined by algebraic varieties. It further emphasises the stability of algebraic operations by means of a natural modelling algebra that extends the usual Boolean operations on point sets...|$|E

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) provide {{the capacity for}} real-time genetic characterization of a disseminating tumor cell population via a simple blood draw. However, there is no straightforward method to analyze broadscale genetic rearrangements in this heterogeneous cell population at the single cell level. We present a one-step controllable chemical extraction of whole nuclei from prostate cancer cells captured using <b>geometrically</b> <b>enhanced</b> differential immunocapture (GEDI) microdevices. We have successfully used copy number profile analysis to differentiate between two unique cancer cell line populations of metastatic origin (LNCaP and VCaP) and to analyze key mutations important in disease progression...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. At a macro scale level, mixing is {{generally}} achieved by a turbulent flow, which makes possible of segregating the fluid in small domains, thereby {{leading to an}} increase in the contact surface and decrease in the mixing path. At low Reynolds number, the viscous effects dominate inertial effects and a completely laminar flow occurs. In the laminar flow system, fluid streams flow parallel to each other and the velocity at any location within the fluid stream is variant with pressure when boundary conditions are constant and due to the change in surface areaâ€“to-volume tension and diffusion, do not simply scale linearly from large to small devices. This makes the use of microfluidic as a mixing device difficult. Thus, the study posed to bridge this gap by created <b>geometrically</b> <b>enhanced</b> Micromixer for homogenous mixing...|$|E
40|$|The {{long term}} effects of {{encapsulation}} individual sheets of the Codex Hammer were investigated. The manuscript was simulated with similar {{sheets of paper}} which were photographed under repeatable raking light conditions to enhance their surface texture, encapsulated in plexiglas, cycled in an environmental test chamber, and rephotographed at selected intervals. The film images were digitized, contrast <b>enhanced,</b> <b>geometrically</b> registered, and apodized. An FFT analysis of a control sheet and two experimental sheets indicates no micro-burnishing, but reveals that the ""mesoscale'' deformations with sizes 8 mm are degrading monotonically, which is of no concern. Difference image analysis indicates that the sheets were increasingly stressed with time and that the plexiglas did not provide a sufficient environmental barrier under the simulation conditions. The relationship of these results to the Codex itself is to be determined...|$|R
40|$|A spatial {{instrument}} {{is defined as}} a display device which has been either <b>geometrically</b> or symbolically <b>enhanced</b> to better enable a user to accomplish a particular task. Research conducted {{over the past several years}} on 3 -D spatial instruments has shown that perspective displays, even when viewed from the correct viewpoint, are subject to systematic viewer biases. These biases interfere with correct spatial judgements of the presented pictorial information. It is also found that deliberate, appropriate geometric distortion of the perspective projection of an image can improve user performance. These two findings raise intriguing questions concerning the design of head-mounted spatial instruments. The design of such instruments may not only require the introduction of compensatory distortions to remove the neutrally occurring biases but also may significantly benefit from the introduction of artificial distortions which enhance performance. These image manipulations, however, can cause a loss of visual-vestibular coordination and induce motion sickness. Additionally, adaptation to these manipulations is apt to be impaired by computational delays in the image display. Consequently, the design of head-mounted spatial instruments will require an understanding of the tolerable limits of visual-vestibular discord...|$|R
40|$|Interacting high mechanical, tribological, {{chemical}} and thermal cyclic load components of hot forging processes are process-related and acting <b>geometrically</b> dependent. To <b>enhance</b> the cost effectiveness, {{there is a}} big interest in reducing the occurring wear which is a result of these complex load regimes during processing. The presented work identifies the different main wear mechanisms in forging dies and the subsequent abstraction in the configuration of different model tests. Thus, an accentuation of the predominant load component was possible in order to develop adapted plasma nitriding processes partially combined with PVD or PEVD hard coatings to reduce effectively the specific wear like plastic deformation, cracking and abrasive or adhesive wear respectively. The change of the primary surface shape of forging tools was found to be essential {{for the development of the}} wear progress. This was described by using the Abbott-Firestone graph finding the core roughness Sk to be a suitable describing parameter. Thus, conditioning methods like abrasive finishing or severe shot peening represent tool enhancements for a further wear reduction. The definition of distinct tool topographies in addition with a stabilization of the initial state of the tool surface achieved with hard coatings and/or additional diffusion treatment is a very promising approach to enhance the wear resistance of forming tools...|$|R

Results {{were compared to}} a 25. 4 mm (1. 0 inch) OD, smooth stainless steel tube. Steam at about 21 kPa (3 psia) was condensed on the outside surface of each enhanced tube, horizontally mounted {{in the center of}} a dummy tube bank. Each tube was cooled on the inside by water. The overall heat transfer coefficient was determined directly from experimental data. The inside and outside heat transfer coefficients were determined using the Wilson plot technique. The cooling water pressure drop was measured inside the tube and converted to the friction factor in the enhanced section. The overall heat transfer coefficients of the enhanced tubes were increased as much as 1. 9 times, and the corrected pressure drops of the enhanced tubes were as large as 4 times the corresponding smooth tube value for the same cooling water velocity.

Results were compared to smooth copper-nickel tubes. Steam at about 21 kPa (3 psia) was condensed on the outside surface of each enhanced tube, horizontally mounted {{in the center of}} a dummy tube bank. Each tube was cooled on the inside by water at velocities of 2. 7 to 7. 6 m/sec (3 to 25 ft/sec). The overall heat transfer coefficient was determined from experimental data. The inside heat transfer coefficients were determined using the Wilson plot technique. Friction factor in the enhanced section was determined from the cooling water pressure drop. Enhanced geometries (utilizing pitch, helix angle and groove depth) were found to improve the corrected overall heat transfer coefficient by as much as 2 times that for smooth tubes. Use of enhanced tubes in place of smooth tubes will permit a decrease in condenser tube surface area from 17 to 53 percent for constant heat loads and constant pumping power.

40|$|Several methodologies {{exist for}} the {{isolation}} of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from cancer patient blood samples. However, there are few straightforward functional analyses for these cells, either downstream or in-situ, particularly in immunocapture-based systems. My thesis work has focused on two methods of cell extraction, and one in-situ assay, that can enable single-cell CTC interrogation using <b>Geometrically</b> <b>Enhanced</b> Differential Immunocapture (GEDI) microdevices. I will also present a non-mechanical, non-enzymatic, method of whole-cell release by substituting standard biotin-avidin immunochemistry with reversible biotin analogues. These data {{are one of the}} first demonstration of linker chemistry substitution for release of cancer cells, and can be combined with various biomechanical assays (e. g. traction force microscopy) to quantify an individual cells properties. Together, these methods provide a toolbox for straightforward extraction of cancer cells from CTC-capture devices, which can enable characterization of individual cell genotype and phenotype. I will also outline experiments which combine high-efficiency, high-purity GEDI cell capture with single-nucleus sequencing (SNS) for single-cell copy-number variation analyses (GEDI-SNS). I will show that GEDI-SNS is comparable to standard methods, can be used to identify key cancer-related genetic variations, and can differentiate between different cancer cell populations of the same tissue ori- gin. Finally, I will present the development of an on-chip assay to monitor Ca 2 + homeostasis, which {{has been shown to be}} critical in taxane chemoresistance, as well as acquisition of a hormonally-independent phenotype. Using real-time, time-lapse, microscopy, I will monitor Ca 2 + flux in cancer cells as a functional assay to inform drug treatment. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E
40|$|Cancer {{metastasis}} {{accounts for}} the majority of cancer-related deaths owing to poor response to anticancer therapies. Molecular understanding of metastasis-associated drug resistance remains elusive due to the scarcity of available tumor tissue. Isolation of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from the peripheral blood of patients has emerged as a valid alternative source of tumor tissue that can be subjected to molecular characterization. However, issues with low purity and sensitivity have impeded adoption to clinical practice. Here we report a novel method to capture and molecularly characterize CTCs isolated from castrate-resistant prostate cancer patients (CRPC) receiving taxane chemotherapy. We have developed a <b>geometrically</b> <b>enhanced</b> differential immunocapture (GEDI) microfluidic device that combines an anti-prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA) antibody with a 3 D geometry that captures CTCs while minimizing nonspecific leukocyte adhesion. Enumeration of GEDI-captured CTCs (defined as intact, nucleated PSMA+/CD 45 - cells) revealed a median of 54 cells per ml identified in CRPC patients versus 3 in healthy donors. Direct comparison with the commercially available CellSearchÂ® revealed a 2 - 400 fold higher sensitivity achieved with the GEDI device. Confocal microscopy of patient-derived GEDI-captured CTCs identified the TMPRSS 2 :ERG fusion protein, while sequencing identified specific androgen receptor point mutation (T 868 A) in blood samples spiked with only 50 PC C 4 - 2 cells. On-chip treatment of patient-derived CTCs with docetaxel and paclitaxel allowed monitoring of drug-target engagement by means of microtubule bundling. CTCs isolated from docetaxel-resistant CRPC patients did not show any evidence of drug activity. These measurements constitute the first functional assays of drug-target engagement in living circulating tumor cells and therefore have the potential to enable longitudinal monitoring of target response and inform the development of new anticancer agents...|$|E
40|$|A mutual {{relationship}} {{exists between}} activities and their physical environment. Change of circumstances in {{the built environment}} cause change of activities, and vice versa, change of activities cause changes of physical environment. How does information originating from activities influence the environment? And how does the environment provide relevant information for activities to take place? Digital and material computation has â€” within architectural design â€” been used extensively to strengthen the capacity to build novel and more <b>geometrically</b> <b>enhanced</b> structures. However on large and small physical as well as long and short temporal scale there is only poor understanding the activities and phenomena {{taking place in the}} built environment. In particular, a lack in understanding of the relationships between changes in physical conditions and changes of activities. The rationale behind implementations and modifications of the built environment is constituted by many actants simultaneously at play, mainly based on human heuristics, sensemaking and semantics. Digital computation can be combined with material, morphological and other types of computation to create models of the past, current and future scenarios. Here this concept is coined !Mixed !Substrate !Computation and relies heavily on successful !embodiment and !embodied !computation. A technology is needed for tracing, extracting and computing both embodied memory and data from activities residing in the environment on different spatial and temporal scales. This thesis presents a set of methods that combine sensors and algorithms to a novel technique of perceiving activities and phenomena over time [...] Consequently, a kind of artificial cognition is demonstrated able to detect recurrent phenomena and in turn perform predictions in seemingly chaotic situations. This discovery can bring about a paradigm shift in design, taking us from our current situation where architects, designers and planners predict and design for future needs using their present day point-of-view, to a situation where design tools are able to learn from complex situations and can predict future needs autonomously. This capacity for perception and prediction contributes to the current discourse on mixed material and digital practices within architectural design â€” filling an increasingly widening gap between material and formal computation: the concept of embodiment. The idea of integrating body and soulâ€”or the physical and the abstractâ€”is a concept which is key for understanding the relationships between phenomena and matter...|$|E

However, the above-mentioned languages do not provide means to directly express the three-dimensional geometry of chemical species. As a consequence models typically capture only the network-topological structure of the species involved. For certain biochemical processes, such as the assembly of molecular complexes, in which steric constraints play a key role, it would seem natural to also model the geometric structure of species. We propose an extension to the Kappa modeling language allowing the annotation of the structure of chemical species with three-dimensional geometric information. This naturally introduces rigidity constraints on the species and reduces the state space of the resulting model by excluding species that are not geometrically sound. We show that models extended in this way can still be simulated efficiently, albeit at the cost of a greater number of null-events occurring during the simulation. The geometric constraints introduced by the extension are inherently non-local in that they may entangle the position and orientation of sub-structures at arbitrary distances in large species such as polymers. We give a formal definition of the notion of locality based on the intuition that local modifications should only affect sub-structures within a finite radius around the point where the modification occurred. We show that there are indeed <b>geometrically</b> <b>enhanced</b> Kappa models that are non-local, and conversely, that every local model can be simulated accurately using a finite classical Kappa model at the expense of a possible combinatorial explosion of its rule set. We also give some sufficient conditions for the locality of a model but show that locality is undecidable in general...|$|E
