25|$|The {{study of}} motion {{can be divided}} into {{kinematics}} and dynamics. Direct kinematics refers to the calculation of <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known. Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), collision avoidance, and singularity avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics, methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot. Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanical}} {{structure of}} a robot must be controlled to perform tasks. The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception, processing, and action (robotic paradigms). Sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g. the position of its joints or its <b>end</b> <b>effector).</b> This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators (motors) which move the mechanical.|$|E
25|$|Repeatability in an {{industrial}} process is also subject {{to the accuracy of}} the <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> for example a gripper, and even to the design of the 'fingers' that match the gripper to the object being grasped. For example, if a robot picks a screw by its head, the screw could be at a random angle. A subsequent attempt to insert the screw into a hole could easily fail. These and similar scenarios can be improved with 'lead-ins' e.g. by making the entrance to the hole tapered.|$|E
25|$|The American National Standard for Industrial Robots and Robot Systems — Safety Requirements (ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999) {{defines a}} {{singularity}} as “a condition {{caused by the}} collinear alignment {{of two or more}} robot axes resulting in unpredictable robot motion and velocities.” It is most common in robot arms that utilize a “triple-roll wrist”. This is a wrist about which the three axes of the wrist, controlling yaw, pitch, and roll, all pass through a common point. An example of a wrist singularity is when the path through which the robot is traveling causes the first and third axes of the robot’s wrist (i.e. robot's axes 4 and 6) to line up. The second wrist axis then attempts to spin 180° in zero time to maintain the orientation of the <b>end</b> <b>effector.</b> Another common term for this singularity is a “wrist flip”. The result of a singularity can be quite dramatic and can have adverse effects on the robot arm, the <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> and the process. Some industrial robot manufacturers have attempted to side-step the situation by slightly altering the robot’s path to prevent this condition. Another method is to slow the robot’s travel speed, thus reducing the speed required for the wrist to make the transition. The ANSI/RIA has mandated that robot manufacturers shall make the user aware of singularities if they occur while the system is being manually manipulated.|$|E

40|$|A space {{spider crane}} for the movement, placement, and or {{assembly}} of various components on {{or in the}} vicinity of a space structure is described. As permanent space structures are utilized by the space program, a means will be required to transport cargo and perform various repair tasks. A space spider crane comprising a small central body with attached manipulators and legs fulfills this requirement. The manipulators may be equipped with constant pressure gripping <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> or tools to accomplish various repair tasks. The legs are also equipped with constant pressure gripping <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> to grip the space structure. Control of the space spider crane may be achieved either by computer software or a remotely situated human operator, who maintains visual contact via television cameras mounted on the space spider crane. One possible walking program consists of a parallel motion walking program whereby the small central body alternatively leans forward and backward relative to <b>end</b> <b>effectors...</b>|$|R
40|$|Ischemic {{heart disease}} {{is the leading cause}} of death worldwide. An {{improved}} understanding of the mechanisms involved in myocardial injury would allow intervention downstream in the pathway where certain drugs including natural products could be efficiently applied to target the <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> of the cell death pathway. Green tea polyphenols (GTPs) have potent anti-oxidative capabilities, which may account for their beneficial effects in preventing oxidative stress associated with ischemia injury. Although studies have provided convincing evidence to support the protective effects of GTPs in cardiovascular system, the potential <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> that mediate cardiac protection are only beginning to be addressed. Proteomics analyses widely used to identify the protein targets for many cardiovascular diseases have advanced the discovery of the signaling mechanism for GTPs-mediated cardio-protection.

25|$|Inverse kinematics: {{a problem}} similar to Inverse {{dynamics}} but with different goals and starting assumptions. While inverse dynamics asks for torques that produce a certain time-trajectory of positions and velocities, inverse kinematics only {{asks for a}} static set of joint angles such that a certain point (or a set of points) of the character (or robot) is positioned at a certain designated location. It is used in synthesizing the appearance of human motion, particularly {{in the field of}} video game design. Another use is in robotics, where joint angles of an arm must be calculated from the desired position of the <b>end</b> <b>effector.</b>|$|E
25|$|STS-129 {{focused on}} staging spare {{components}} outside the station. The 11-day flight included three spacewalks. The payload bay carried two large ExPRESS Logistics Carriers holding two spare gyroscopes, two nitrogen tank assemblies, two pump modules, an ammonia tank assembly, a spare latching <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> for the station's robotic arm, a spare trailing umbilical {{system for the}} Mobile Transporter, and a high-pressure gas tank. STS-129 was the first flight of an ExPRESS Logistics Carrier. The completion of this mission left six space shuttle flights remaining {{until the end of}} the Space Shuttle program, after STS-135 was approved in February 2011.|$|E
25|$|The final spacewalk of the STS-134 mission, and {{the final}} spacewalk of the Space Shuttle program, was carried out on flight day 12. The EVA was {{conducted}} by Mike Fincke and Greg Chamitoff, who began the EVA by installing the Orbiter Boom Sensor System (OBSS) on the Starboard 1 (S1) truss segment. After the OBSS was installed, Fincke and Chamitoff removed the <b>End</b> <b>Effector</b> Grapple Fixture (EFGF) {{and replaced it with}} a spare Power and Data Grapple Fixture (PDGF). The station's Canadarm2 could not grapple the EFGF, so the PDGF was installed on the end. After that task was completed, Fincke and Chamitoff moved to the Express Logistics Carrier (ELC) 3, and released some torque on the bolts that were holding the spare arm for Dextre down against the ELC. The EVA saw the total cumulative time spent performing EVAs in support of the ISS pass the 1,000-hour mark. The three STS-134 spacewalkers spent a total time of 28 hours and 44 minutes outside the ISS on this mission. Commander Mark Kelly assisted with documenting the spacewalk by taking photos and video. In the meantime, the rest of the shuttle crew completed more equipment transfers from Endeavour and the Johannes Kepler ATV to the ISS.|$|E

40|$|A {{configuration}} of an articulated figure of joints and segments {{can sometimes be}} specified as spatial constraints. Constrained parts on the articulated figure are abstracted as <b>end</b> <b>effectors,</b> and the counterparts in the space are abstracted as goals. The goal (constraint) {{can be as simple}} as a position, an orientation, a weighted combination of position and orientation, a line, a plane, a direction, and so on, or it could be as complicated as a region in the space. An articulated figure consists of various segments connected together by joints. Each joint has some degrees of freedom which are subject to joint limits and manual adjustment. This paper presents an efficient algorithm to adjust the joint angles subject to joint limits so that the set of <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> concurrently attempt to achieve their respective goals. Users specify <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> and goals: the program computes a final configuration in real time in the sense that actions appear to take no longer than actual physical activities would.

2500|$|For a given robot {{the only}} {{parameters}} necessary to completely locate the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> (gripper, welding torch, etc.) of the robot are the angles {{of each of}} the joints or displacements of the linear axes (or combinations of the two for robot formats such as SCARA). However, there are many different ways to define the points. The most common and most convenient way of defining a point is to specify a Cartesian coordinate for it, i.e. the position of the 'end effector' in mm in the X, Y and Z directions relative to the robot's origin. In addition, depending on the types of joints a particular robot may have, the orientation of the <b>end</b> <b>effector</b> in yaw, pitch, and roll and the location of the tool point relative to the robot's faceplate must also be specified. For a jointed arm these coordinates must be converted to joint angles by the robot controller and such conversions are known as Cartesian Transformations which may need to be performed iteratively or recursively for a multiple axis robot. The mathematics of the relationship between joint angles and actual spatial coordinates is called kinematics. See robot control ...|$|E
2500|$|The most {{essential}} robot peripheral is the <b>end</b> <b>effector,</b> or end-of-arm-tooling (EOT). Common examples of end effectors include welding devices (such as MIG-welding guns, spot-welders, etc.), spray guns and also grinding and deburring devices (such as pneumatic disk or belt grinders, burrs, etc.), and grippers (devices that can grasp an object, usually electromechanical or pneumatic). Another common means {{of picking up}} an object is by vacuum. End effectors are frequently highly complex, made to match the handled product and often capable of picking up an array of products at one time.

The lack of temperature insensitive and accurate force feedback <b>end</b> <b>effectors</b> make the current minimally invasive surgeries (MIS) less effective especially {{in the area of}} electrosurgery.
