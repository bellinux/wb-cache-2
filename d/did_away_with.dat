In that same decade they added an organ, <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the prayer shawl, {{and started a}} religious school. In the 1870s {{the congregation}} removed yahrzeit candles from the sanctuary, and added family pews and a mixed choir (men and women together). In 1873 B'nai Yeshurun {{was one of the}} first thirteen founding members of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations (UAHC), now Union for Reform Judaism.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Middle Ages, the {{functions}} and composition of households started to change. This was due primarily to two factors. First of all, the introduction of gunpowder to the field of warfare rendered the castle a less effective defence, and <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the military function of the household. The result was a household more focused on comfort and luxury, and with a significantly larger proportion of women.|$|E
5|$|Grammars and {{dictionaries}} {{of indigenous}} languages were composed throughout the colonial period, but their quality was {{highest in the}} initial period. The friars found that learning all the indigenous languages was impossible in practice, so they concentrated on Nahuatl. For a time, the linguistic situation in Mesoamerica remained relatively stable, but in 1696, Charles II of Spain issued a decree banning {{the use of any}} language other than Spanish throughout the Spanish Empire. In 1770 another decree, calling for the elimination of the indigenous languages, <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> Classical Nahuatl as a literary language. Until Mexican Independence in 1821, the Spanish courts admitted Nahuatl testimony and documentation as evidence in lawsuits, with court translators rendering it in Spanish.|$|E

5|$|Neorealism ("The {{world is}} made of {{ordinary}} objects.") Constructed by David Bohm and also associated with Louis de Broglie, this interpretation holds that quantum objects possess definite attributes, but that these attributes can change value instantly in response to events anywhere in the universe, with this information encoded in a physical pilot wave which {{must be able to}} travel faster than light. Other physicists attempted to construct object-based models which <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> this superluminal communication, but Bell's theorem later proved this to be impossible. For this reason, according to Herbert, neorealism is rejected by most of the physics establishment.|$|E
5|$|Trying {{to come up}} with {{a better}} way to {{generate}} alternating current, Tesla developed a steam powered reciprocating electricity generator. He patented it in 1893 and introduced it at the Chicago World's Columbian Exposition that year. Steam would be forced into the oscillator and rush out through a series of ports, pushing a piston up and down that was attached to an armature. The magnetic armature vibrated up and down at high speed, producing an alternating magnetic field. This induced alternating electric current in the wire coils located adjacent. It <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the complicated parts of a steam engine/generator, but never caught on as a feasible engineering solution to generate electricity.|$|E
5|$|Before 1951, several {{different}} flags {{had been in}} use since the Revolution. The earliest flag was plain red, and was used in 1919 during {{the existence of the}} Lithuanian-Byelorussian SSR. After the formation of the Byelorussian SSR, the lettering ССРБ (SSRB) was added in gold to the top hoist. This design was established {{with the passage of the}} first Constitution of the Byelorussian SSR. It was later modified in the 1927 Constitution where the letters were changed to БССР (BSSR) but kept the overall design the same. This design was changed in 1937, when a hammer and sickle and red star were placed above the letters. The flag dimensions were also formally established as 1:2 for the first time. This flag remained in use until the adoption of the 1951 flag, which <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the letters.|$|E

5|$|In 1951, she ran {{again for}} city council, and was successful. The {{election}} {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} voters that April, designed to shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something reformers believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government from Republicans {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a part of that wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> multi-member council districts).|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with the cost per miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E
5|$|Ralph Houk {{was chosen}} to replace Stengel. During the 1961 season, both Mantle and Maris chased Ruth's single-season home run record of 60, and the pair {{attracted}} much press attention as the year progressed. Ultimately, an infection forced Mantle to leave the lineup and bow {{out of the race}} in mid-September with 54 home runs. Maris continued, though, and on October 1, {{the final day of the}} season, he homered against Red Sox pitcher Tracy Stallard into the right field stands of Yankee Stadium, breaking the record with 61. Commissioner Ford Frick decreed that two separate records be kept, as the Yankees played a 154-game schedule in 1927 (beginning in 1961, AL teams played 162 games to accommodate the league's expansion to 10 teams). MLB <b>did</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> the dual records 30 years later, giving Maris sole possession of the single-season home run record before it was broken in 1998 by Mark McGwire. The Yankees won the pennant with 109 regular season wins, at the time the club's second-highest single-season total, and defeated the Cincinnati Reds in five games to win the franchise's 19th World Series. The team hit 240 home runs to break the MLB single-season record. Maris won another AL MVP Award, while Whitey Ford captured the Cy Young Award, having posted a 25–4 record. The team gained a reputation as one of the strongest the Yankees had fielded, along with the 1927 and 1939 Yankees. New York returned to the World Series in 1962, facing the San Francisco Giants. After exchanging victories in the first six games of the Series, the Yankees won the decisive seventh game 1–0 to clinch the title.|$|E
