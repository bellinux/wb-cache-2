40|$|AbstractThe paper {{investigates the}} role of planar <b>datum</b> <b>features</b> in {{tolerance}} analysis problems. Mating relations between datum planes are shown to involve translational and rotational errors, which are related to form tolerances and are usually neglected in tolerance analysis. To evaluate these errors, the contact between datum planes was simulated by a stochastic model, where two surface profiles are randomly generated and then registered to reproduce a mating condition. Concepts of fractal geometry were exploited to make the generation consistent with the autocorrelation properties of actual surfaces resulting from manufacturing processes. A simulation plan allowed to predict the amount of contact errors {{as a function of}} size, tolerance and process-related assumptions on the two features. An example of 3 D tolerance chain is presented to demonstrate the relevance of form errors in the variation of assembly requirements...|$|E
40|$|So what is Shrinkwrap all about? For {{those of}} you who may not know about it, Shrinkwrap is a type of data {{structure}} that can manifest itself as a feature or model. It is cleverly covered up, almost hidden, and doesn't get the press or widespread use of a solid or surface. The shrinkwrap feature is located under the data sharing submenu of the feature menu. The shrinkwrap feature, as described by PTC, is a collection of surfaces and <b>datum</b> <b>features</b> of a model that represents the exterior of the model. The advantages and applications of the shrinkwrap feature are in the creation of minimal memory guzzling representations of assemblies. These can be used to represent subassemblies in parent assemblies, and can handle control of dependency issues, geometry represented, and additional references through the use of the shrinkwrap feature options. The shrinkwrap model is an option available under the save as umbrella. Its function, as described by PTC, is to share data with internal and external design groups and improve performance in large assembly design. Some of the benefits of the shrinkwrap model include being able to represent complex assemblies with a single, lightweight part that protects design intent and parametric data, and the ability to improve performance of large assembly modeling in the area of less load time. The proper-scale models can be saved as IGES, STEP, and VRML (for fly-throughs) ...|$|E
40|$|Coordinate {{measuring}} machines (CMMs) {{are complex}} measuring {{systems that are}} widely used in manufacturing industry for form, size, position, and orientation assessment. In essence, these systems collect a set of individual data points that in practice is often a relatively small sample of an object. Their software then processes these points {{in order to produce}} a geometric result or to establish a local coordinate system from <b>datum</b> <b>features.</b> The subject of CMM evaluation is a broad and multifaceted one. This paper is concerned with the uncertainty in the coordinates of each point within the measuring volume of the CMM. Therefore, a novel method for measurement uncertainty evaluation using limited-size data sets is conceived and developed. The proposed method is based on a Bayesian regularized artificial neural network (BRANN) model consisting of three inputs and one output. The inputs are: the nominal coordinates; the ambient temperature; and the temperature of the workpiece. The output is the measured (actual) coordinates. An algorithm is developed and implemented before training the BRANN in order to map each nominal coordinate associated with the other inputs to the target coordinate. For validation the model is trained using a relatively small sample size of ten data sets to predict the variability of a larger sample size of ninety data sets. The calculated uncertainty is improved by more than 80 % using the predicted variability compared to the uncertainty from the limited sample data set...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn {{assembly}} tolerance analysis method {{based on the}} real machine model is proposed, aiming to investigate {{the effect of the}} geometric errors of <b>datum</b> <b>feature</b> on the result of tolerance chain. The real parts are simulated by the variation of the geometric features, which are represented by the control point variation model and generated by the Monte Carlo simulation. The investigated objective is the assembly success rate of pin-hole assembly at the location with the three datum planes, the assembly clearance or interference is calculated according to the assembly requirements and assembly process. The part coordinate system in assembly is constructed firstly by the datum embodiment principles, then the position of the junction planes are determined according to the assembly requirements, and finally, the position of the parts relative to machine are determined by the coordinate transformation. The assembly success rate is represented by the probability distribution of clearance or interference between pin and hole, and the influences of the datum errors on the assembly result are discussed by the example assembly...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe datum {{reference}} frame (DRF) is an orthogonal coordinate system used {{to locate the}} geometric features in tolerance technology and is a fundamental tool for tolerance analysis, tolerance validation and tolerance inspection. Additionally, establishment of the composition principle for DRF is an essential process for automation of tolerance technology. This paper presents {{the concept of a}} construction element of the DRF and the composition principle of DRF using the construction element. In this approach, the DRF is decomposed into three construction elements, i. e., a point, a line passing through the point, and a plane containing the line, and DRF is established by determining these three construction elements. The rules and algorithms used to determine the construction elements are established and the construction elements can be automatically established from the <b>datum</b> <b>feature</b> according to the rules and algorithm. The composition rules of the DRF are defined with the construction elements, and the DRF can be constructed automatically.

40|$|Geometric {{dimensioning}} and tolerancing, or GD&T, is {{a symbolic}} language that permits design engineers, manufacturing personnel, and quality inspectors {{to communicate in}} an e cient and e ective manner. This communication focuses on providing a clear de nition of geometric features (e. g., surfaces, holes) and the allowable variation that each feature may contain. Unfortunately, owing in part to its complex rule based system, GD&T is also di cult to teach and learn. To address this di culty, a technique has been developed that allows students to visualize geometric tolerances and tolerance zones, and to directly see when a given data point is {{in or out of}} tolerance. The technique employs a portable coordinate measuring machine (CMM) interfaced with parametric solid modeling software, a 3 D printer, and a granite surface table to accomplish this. A set of engineering drawings is created, and a 3 D printer is used to produce imperfect parts. These imperfections are intended to represent signi cant manufacturing variation. Then using a portable CMM and the surface table, data points are taken to visually map this manufacturing variation to a 3 D parametric modeling software package. Within this software a perfect part is also modeled. Once the inspection data is taken, <b>datum</b> <b>features</b> on the perfect part are used to form the boundaries of the geometric tolerance zones. Through this process, students interactively learn the meaning of datum references, as well as how the various tolerances create di erent zones. Finally, students use the parametric modeling software to measure the inspection data points to visually see how in or out of speci cation a given feature is. Having developed a basic working understanding of GD&T, a second module is used to convey design intent through the use of GD&T. Using a simple assembly, students are charged with providing a fully toleranced drawing for one component of this assembly. Students are given a fully dimensioned drawing with basic dimensions and a list of t, form, and functional requirements. From these resources, students must choose a datum scheme, tolerance part features, and explain which requirements drive their decisions. In summary, the goal of these educational modules is to illustrate the complex topics of geometric dimensioning and tolerancing through practical application...|$|E

Palmprint is rich in features like geometry <b>features,</b> line <b>features,</b> <b>datum</b> points, delta <b>features</b> and minutiae features. Several edge detection methods are available to extract line feature from the palmprint. In this paper, the hand image is pre-processed to get the desired Region of Interest (ROI) /palmprint. Multiscale Sobel Code operators of different orientations (0 Â°, 45 Â°, 90 Â°, and 135 Â°) are applied to the palmprint to extract Sobel-Palmprint features in different directions. The Sobel-Palmprint features extracted are stored in Sobel-Palmprint feature vector and matched using Hamming Distance similarity measurement method. In addition, a Min Max Threshold Range (MMTR) method is proposed that helps in increasing overall system accuracy by matching a person with multiple threshold values. In this technique, firstly the person is authenticated at global level using Reference threshold. Secondly, the person is authenticated at local level using range of Minimum and Maximum thresholds defined for a person. Generally, personal authentication is done using reference threshold but there are chances of false acceptance. So, by using the Minimum and Maximum Thresholds range of false accepted persons at personal level, a person is identified to be false accepted or genuinely accepted. MMTR is an effective technique to increase {{the accuracy of the}} palmprint authentication system by reducing the False Acceptance Rate (FAR).

40|$|Registration {{activities}} combine {{data from}} different sources {{in order to}} attain higher accuracy and derive more information than available from one source. The increasing availability {{of a wide variety}} of sensors capable of capturing high quality and complementary data requires parallel efforts for developing accurate and robust registration techniques. Currently, photogrammetric and LIDAR systems are being incorporated in a wide spectrum of mapping applicaÂ¬tions such as city modeling, surface reconstruction, and object recognition. Photogrammetric processing of overlapping imagery provides accurate information regarding object space break-lines in addition to an explicit semantic description of the photographed objects. On the other hand, LIDAR systems supply dense geometric surface information in the form of non-selective points. Considering the properties of photogrammetric and LIDAR data, it is clear that the two technologies provide complementary information. However, the synergic characteristics of both systems can be fully utilized only after successful registration of the photogrammetric and LIDAR data relative to a common reference frame. The registration methodology has to deal with three issues: registration primitives, transformation function, and similarity measure. This paper presents two methodologies for utilizing straight-line features derived from both datasets as the registration primitives. The first methodology directly incorporates the LIDAR lines as control information in the photogrammetric triangulation. The second methodology starts by generating a photogrammetric model relative to an arbitrary <b>datum.</b> Then, LIDAR <b>features</b> are used as control information for the absolute orientation of the photogramÂ¬metric model. In addition to the registration methodologies, the paper presents a comparative analysis between two approaches for extracting linear features from raw and processed/interpolated LIDAR data. Also, a comparative analysis between metric analog and amateur digital cameras within the registration process will be presented. The performÂ¬ance analysis is based on the quality of fit of the final alignment between the LIDAR and photogrammetric models...|$|R
