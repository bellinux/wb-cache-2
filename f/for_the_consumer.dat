Home's premiership was the second briefest of the twentieth century, lasting two days short of a year. Among the legislation passed under his government was the abolition of resale price maintenance, bringing costs down <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> against the interests of producers of food and other commodities.|$|E
5|$|Key is a Japanese visual novel studio which {{formed on}} July 21, 1998 as a brand under the {{publisher}} VisualArt's and {{is located in}} Kita, Osaka. Key's debut visual novel Kanon (1999) combined an elaborate storyline, up-to-date anime-style art, and a musical score which helped to set the mood for the game. Key's second game Air (2000) had a similar if not more complex storyline to Kanon and a more thorough gameplay. Both Kanon and Air were originally produced as adult games, but Key broke this trend with their third title Clannad (2004) released for all ages. Key {{has worked in the}} past with Interchannel and Prototype <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> port releases of the brand's games. Key collaborated with P.A. Works and Aniplex to produce the anime series Angel Beats! (2010) and Charlotte (2015). Key has released 12 games, the latest being the kinetic novel Harmonia (2016). Key has announced the visual novel Summer Pockets.|$|E

25|$|Producers {{and sellers}} of popcorn {{consider}} two major factors {{in evaluating the}} quality of popcorn: what percentage of the kernels will pop, and how much each popped kernel expands. Expansion is an important factor to both the consumer and vendor. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer,</b> larger pieces of popcorn tend to be more tender and are associated with higher quality. For the grower, distributor, and vendor, expansion is closely correlated with profit: vendors such as theaters buy popcorn by weight and sell it by volume. For both these reasons, higher-expansion popcorn fetches a higher profit per unit weight.|$|E
25|$|For instance, a {{power factor}} of 68 percent (0.68) means that only 68 {{percent of the}} total current {{supplied}} is actually doing work; the remaining 32 percent is reactive and has to be made up by the utility. Usually, utilities do not charge consumers for the reactive power losses as they do no real work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer.</b> However, if there are inefficiencies at the customer’s load source that causes the power factor to fall below a certain level, utilities may charge customers in order to cover an increase in their power plant fuel use and their worse line and plant capacity.|$|E

25|$|The {{conventional}} business {{view of the}} EV1 as {{a failure}} is inherently controversial. If it is viewed {{as an attempt to}} produce a viable EV product, then it was a success, although certainly from GM's perspective the vehicle was not a commercial success, since the high profit margins typically seen with internal combustion engine vehicles remained elusive. However, if one considers the vehicle as a technological showpiece—a production electric car that actually could replace a gasoline powered vehicle—then the program's outcome is less definitive. The EV1 was produced <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer</b> market, and many lessees found driving an EV1 to be a favorable experience.|$|E

The juice will be extracted out by a juice extraction system. The outer skin, seed, stem, and fiber of fruits would be separated from the juice in a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.|$|E
25|$|<b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer,</b> channel {{switching}} offers {{a more diverse}} shopping experience. However, marketers need to be alert to {{channel switching}} because of its potential to erode market share. Evidence of channel switching can suggest that disruptive forces are at play, and that consumer behaviour is undergoing fundamental changes. A consumer may be prompted to switch channels when the product or service can be found cheaper, when superior models become available, when a wider range is offered, or simply {{because it is more}} convenient to shop through a different channel (e.g. online or one-stop shopping). As a hedge against market share losses due to switching behaviour, some retailers engage in multi-channel retailing.|$|E
