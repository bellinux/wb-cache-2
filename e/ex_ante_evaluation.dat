50|$|Bruno S. Frey (with Marcel Kucher) {{examines}} in {{the paper}} “History as Reflected in Capital Markets: The Case of World War ll”'''', how movements in bond prices {{can be linked to}} historical events. He finds in an econometric analysis’ of price movements of bonds issued by five European governments, which were traded on the Swiss bourse between 1928 and 1948, that most events to which historians attach great importance are reflected in price changes for bonds. However, some major events are not reflected, for example Germany’s capitulation in 1945. Frey and Kucher find for this particular case that bond prices already had changed much earlier when the Allied powers decided at Yalta that they would only accept a total capitulation at all fronts. This indicates an interesting friction between historians’ ex post evaluation of events and the price setting parameters for traders as an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluation.</b> Frey and Kucher discuss the potential insight for historical research using market data and econometric analysis. They refer to efficient market theory in order to identify three central advantages of capital market data to other data sources: (a) Data is correctly recorded since bourses are quasi-public. What is assessed is the decision makers expectations about the future; (b) Investors tend to evaluate the situation carefully because they are engaged with their own money; (c) Financial markets usually exhibit a high predictive power, due to marginal traders.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{an issue}} that has received little attention in the literature on health state evaluation: the relevance of the ex ante/ex post distinction in the assessment of quality of life. Ex post evaluations are based on experience of the health state being evaluated. <b>Ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluations</b> are made in anticipation of actually experiencing the health state, and are able to capture sources of pre-outcome (dis) utility such as anticipatory fear, anxiety, hope and dread. Which perspective should be used for economic evaluation? From the welfarist perspective it might be argued that <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluations</b> should be used, because all sources of utility are relevant. From the extra-welfarist perspective it might argued that ex post evaluations should be used, because economic evaluation should be based solely on realised outcomes, at least {{in the context of a}} publicly financed health service. We sought the views of the Australian public on this issue. Using social willingness to pay questions, we asked respondents to select between alternative health services which either did, or did not, take pre-outcome sources of utility into account.

This paper reports on an incorporation of indirect taxes, mainly VAT, excises and other consumption taxes, in the EUROMOD-microsimulation model. We sharpen the distributional picture of the overall tax and benefit system by bringing the indirect tax incidence for five European countries into the picture. We investigate explanations for the regressivity, and study the distributional effect of an integrated simulation of changes in social security contributions and indirect taxes as compensating channels of collecting government revenue.

40|$|This {{essay is}} a {{critique}} of research evaluation research. Considerable evidence exists that agricultural research conducted during the era when projects were chosen by diffuse selection systems yielded extraordinarily high returns. It is not obvious that the formalized, quantitative, and typically centralized selection models {{can be expected to}} produce higher contemporary returns than the decentralized informal mechanisms. All <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>evaluations</b> are intrinsically subjective, regardless of technique used to generate the evaluation. The extreme uncertainty surrounding the nonrepetitive new-knowledge production function further limits the potential of the sophisticated selection procedures. Perhaps of greatest importance, however, are the high costs imposed by these procedures in terms of scientists' time, morale, and "artistic" research tool atrophication.
