5000|$|The museums {{blue whale}} exhibit was {{included}} in Scout Magazines list of [...] "1,000 Cool Things about Vancouver". Author Andrew Morrison commented that while [...] "of course {{the rest of the}} place is pretty amazing, too...the whale is the thing that draws me back. I just <b>gawp</b> <b>at</b> the thing, amazed at how big it is". The Globe and Mail called the whale [...] "an inescapable presence" [...] for museum visitors.|$|R
500|$|Time Out Film Guide {{made similar}} {{criticisms of the}} film's content, calling it [...] " [...] bloody, blatantly exploitative mess of a movie", and says it is [...] "just another {{opportunity}} to <b>gawp</b> <b>at</b> raw scenes of sex and (more especially) violence". Due to its graphic content, the film was also used by James Ferman at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts {{as an example of}} the need for film censorship.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was escorted}} by a bouncing, black-eyed {{waitress}} {{to a table}} for four. The next table was a long one, at which seven traveling men, or local business men whose wives were at the lake for the summer, ceased trying to get nourishment out of the food, and <b>gawped</b> <b>at</b> her. Before the Boltwoods were seated, the waitress dabbed at non-existent spots on their napkins, ignored a genuine crumb on the cloth in front of Claire's plate, made motions at a cup and a formerly plated fork, and bubbled, [...] "Autoing through?" ...|$|R
60|$|Sanford Hunt {{helped her}} find a rubber in the high-school-like coat-room {{on a rainy}} day when the girls were giggling and the {{tremendous}} swells of the institution were whooping and slapping one another {{on the back and}} acting as much as possible like their ideal of college men--an ideal presumably derived from motion pictures and college playlets in vaudeville. Una saw J. J. Todd <b>gawping</b> <b>at</b> her, but not offering to help, while a foreshortened Sanford groped along the floor, under the dusty line of coats, for her missing left rubber. Sanford came up with the rubber, smiled like a nice boy, and walked with her to the Subway.|$|R
5000|$|The {{content of}} the film, {{particularly}} the graphic violence and human death, has been criticized as too explicit and exploitative. Robert Firsching of Allmovie states: [...] The reason for the film's notoriety, however, {{is a collection of}} grainy 16 mm images depicting the horrific round-up, mutilation, castration, and slaughter of a group of tribesmen by white mercenaries. As appalling and revolting a sequence as ever depicted in a documentary film, the massacre footage marked something of {{a turning point in the}} development of the mondo subgenre, which moved increasingly toward snuff-like collections of death and mutilation. Time Out Film Guide made similar criticisms of the film's content, calling it [...] "a bloody, blatantly exploitative mess of a movie", and says it is [...] "just another opportunity to <b>gawp</b> <b>at</b> raw scenes of sex and (more especially) violence". Due to its graphic content, the film was also used by James Ferman at the British Academy of Film and Television Arts as an example of the need for film censorship.|$|R
5000|$|The album {{received}} mostly negative {{reviews from}} music critics. Entertainment Scene 360's Eleanor O'Donnell, {{who voted for}} Mills every week on The X Factor, stated that [...] "The flouncy new image coupled with these weak, busy yet placid songs and soulless vocal performances on his debut album makes Mills an artist I will not continue to support {{in the future and}} this an album I cannot recommend." [...] Chris Jones of BBC Music wrote that [...] "...the relentless freak show-cum-faux 'talent' show that we love to <b>gawp</b> <b>at</b> on a Saturday night seems to have actually found someone who may survive the cruel seas of tabloid popularity and become a voice to remember." [...] In a 2.5/5 star review, Sharon Mawer of AllMusic commended Mills for his versions of [...] "Maggie May" [...] and [...] "With a Little Help from My Friends" [...] and [...] "Somebody to Love", but admitted that his original songs [...] "...were not of the same quality as the covers, nearly half of which he had sung on the show, thereby making his versions well known in their own right." ...|$|R
500|$|In Eric Shanower's graphic novel Age of Bronze, {{currently}} {{still being}} serialised, Troilus is youthful {{but not the}} youngest son of Priam and Hecuba. In the first two collected volumes of {{this version of the}} Trojan War, Shanower provides a total of six pages of sources covering the story elements of his work alone. These include most of the fictional works discussed above from Guido and Boccaccio down to Morley and Walton. Shanower begins Troilus' love story with the youth making fun of Polyxena's love for Hector and in the process accidentally knocking aside Cressida's veil. He follows the latter into the temple of Athena to <b>gawp</b> <b>at</b> her. Pandarus is the widow Cressida's uncle encouraging him. Cressida rejects Troilus' initial advances not because of wanting to act in a seemly manner, as in Chaucer or Shakespeare, but because she thinks of him as just a boy. However, her uncle persuades her to encourage his affection, in the hope that being close to a son of Priam will protect against the hostility of the Trojans to the family of the traitor Calchas. Troilus' unrequited love is used as comic relief in an otherwise serious retelling of the Trojan War cycle. The character is portrayed as often indecisive and ineffectual as on the second page of this episode sample at the official site [...] It {{remains to be seen how}} Shanower will further develop the story.|$|R
500|$|Lambert {{shared his}} {{interests}} {{and knowledge of}} sports, dogs and animal husbandry with London's middle and upper classes, and it soon became highly fashionable to visit him, or become his friend. Many called repeatedly; one banker made 20visits, paying the admission fee on each occasion. During this period of English history no real stigma was attached to obesity, and Lambert was generally considered a wonder to be marvelled at, rather than a freak to be <b>gawped</b> or sneered <b>at.</b> His business venture was immediately successful, drawing around 400paying visitors per day. His home was described as having {{the air of a}} fashionable resort, rather than that of an exhibition, and he was pleased to find that his customers generally treated him with courtesy, and not simply as a spectacle. He insisted on maintaining amongst his visitors an atmosphere of civility and all men entering his rooms were obliged to remove their hats. One visitor refused to remove his [...] "even if the King were present" [...] but Lambert replied that [...] "Then by G——, Sir, you must instantly quit this room, as I do not consider it a mark of respect due to myself, but to the ladies and gentlemen who honor me with their company." ...|$|R
