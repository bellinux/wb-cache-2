40|$|A {{functional}} {{device was}} developed to immediately show the localization of veins by detecting a temperature increase on the skin directly above them. Our new idea, compared to other developments, is the comparison of temperatures between a small, ideally punctiform, skin area, and a larger circularly surrounding area. This is realized by two infrared temperature sensors, one with a small field of view, {{and the other one}} with a larger field of view. The position of the vein is indicated by two laser modules, which beams cross in one spot, when the device is held in a defined distance to the skin. If the device is held over a vein, the laser spot lightens up. The device was tested in ten study participants. Cooling of the skin by <b>disinfectant</b> <b>spray</b> prior to the measurements increases the temperature gradient and thereby improves the efficiency of the device. Temperature profiles of four skin areas of each study participant were measured before and one minute after application of <b>disinfectant</b> <b>spray.</b> After application of <b>disinfectant</b> <b>spray,</b> a temperature difference of more than 0. 3 K between a measuring point above a vein and points 15 mm next to this could be found in 36 out of 40 measurements (90 %), compared to 26 out of 40 (65 %) before disinfection.

40|$|ABSTRACT Studies {{carried out}} at the {{laboratory}} and in the field identified many potential problems during disinfection of poultry units naturally con-taminated with Salmonella enteritidis. There appeared to be variations in the efficiency of commonly used disinfectants within a disinfectant group when used in a contaminated house. It was possible for Salmonella and other coliforms to be amplified during the pressure washing or steam cleaning process. If an effective terminal disinfectant was not used after this, then high levels of Salmonella were likely to persist. The efficiency of the disinfection regimen was not directly dependent on the standard of physical cleaning if this was carried out to a reasonable standard, as {{a high level of}} elimination of Salmonella could be achieved even in the presence of substantial quantities of residual organic matter.

30|$|Due to the {{non-linearity}} of websites, {{the definition}} of the recording unit is an important parameter during the selection of samples. Within one domain, only those pages were analysed that were linked with hyperlinks and dealt with disinfectants, their use or their avoidance (Additional file 2). To find these pages, also internal search operations were used. One search was conducted with the keyword ‘Desinfektionsmittel’ and another one with ‘Hygiene’. If the website of a product line had several pages for different products, only one sample product page was chosen in 2012 and analysed. It was assumed that within one website, the amount of product-specific information would be the same for all products. As some companies have different websites for different product lines, up to three products from one company were analysed. However, the amount of information was supposed to be different between websites for different product lines. If possible, webpages on <b>disinfectant</b> <b>sprays</b> for surfaces were chosen to increase the comparability between the products.

In this study, the capacities of Lysol <b>Disinfectant</b> <b>Spray</b> (0. 1 % o-phenylphenol and 79 % ethanol), a domestic bleach (6 % sodium hypochlorite diluted to give 800 ppm of free chlorine), a quaternary ammonium-based product (7. 05 % quaternary ammonium diluted 1 : 128 in tap water), and a phenol-based product (14. 7 % phenol diluted 1 : 256 in tap water) were compared in interrupting the transfer of rhinovirus type 14 from stainless steel disks to fingerpads of human volunteers upon a 10 -s contact at a pressure of 1 kg/cm 2. Ten microliters of the virus, suspended in bovine mucin (5 mg/ml), was placed on each disk, and the inoculum was dried under ambient conditions; the input number on each disk ranged from 0. 5 x 10 (5) to 2. 1 x 10 (6) PFU.

MethodsThe coliphage MS- 2 was seeded onto a staff member's hands, and samples were collected after 4  hours from fomites and hands. After 3 consecutive days of sample collection, a 14 -day hygiene intervention was implemented. Hand sanitizers, hand and face wipes, antiviral tissues, and a <b>disinfectant</b> <b>spray</b> were distributed to employees and residents. Seeding and sampling were repeated postintervention. ResultsAnalysis of the pre- and postintervention data was performed using a Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

40|$|A {{model was}} {{developed}} {{to examine the effects}} of disinfectants on the transmission of infectious rotavirus from a dried surface to humans. The initial experiments were designed to find a method of preserving rotavirus infectivity during drying. Culture-adapted human rotavirus (CJN strain) was dried at room temperature in different organic suspensions, including fecal matter, several laboratory media, and nonfat dry milk (NDM). Recoveries of infectious virus were then compared. Fecal matter provided little protection in this study relative to distilled water, but the other suspensions were quite protective, especially NDM, which consistently allowed recoveries of greater than 50 %. When 10 (3) focus-forming units of unpassaged CJN virus were dried in NDM and administered to subjects who licked the dried material, 100 % (8 of 8) became infected. The effect of Lysol brand <b>disinfectant</b> <b>spray</b> (LDS) was next examined. Although NDM provided some protection against inactivation by LDS, spraying under conditions recommended by the manufacturer consistently caused the CJN virus titer to decrease greater than 5 log 10. Consumption of CJN virus (10 (3) focus-forming units) sprayed with LDS caused no infection in 14 subjects, whereas 13 of 14 subjects who consumed the unsprayed virus became infected (P less than 0. 00001). The methods developed in this study could be used to test the effects of other disinfectants on the spread of infectious rotavirus from inanimate surfaces to humans...|$|R

40|$|Clostridium difficile is a spore-forming, gram {{positive}} bacteria {{responsible for}} causing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), the main symptom {{of which is}} diarrhoea. It can also cause serious symptoms, for example, pseudomembranous colitis, toxic megacolon and death. CDI spreads through the ingestion of C. difficile spores, which are very resistant to cleaning products and can survive on surfaces for many months. Little {{is known about the}} germination of C. difficile spores; taurocholic acid, a bile acid found naturally in the gut is one of the known germinants, but the exact mechanism of germination is unknown. Other bile acids, such as cholic acid have shown germinating ability, but to a lesser extent. The aim of this PhD was to create a polymer surface that forced the germination of the C. difficile spores upon contact, then to kill the resulting more susceptible vegetative cell. A known germinant of C. difficile spores, cholic acid, was derivatised at the carboxyl group in a flexible synthesis to give a range of carboxamide analogues terminating in a quaternised amino function, with or without a polymerisable function. The attachment of polymerisable groups at the hydroxyl functions was also explored. The cholic acid monomers proved to be resistant to polymerisation. Of the monomeric compounds, however, nine exhibited C. difficile spore-germinating activity, two had either sporicidal or germinating and antimicrobial abilities and two other compounds had germinating and sporicidal and/or antimicrobial activity. The results for this series of compounds indicate that germination of C. difficile spores is favoured by the presence of a quaternary ammonium function and a two- to four-carbon chain between the cholamide carbonyl and the quaternary centre. Overall, eleven new compounds exhibited activity against C. difficile spores. The incorporation of these compounds into a polymer surface or <b>disinfectant</b> <b>spray</b> has the potential {{to reduce the risk of}} infection of CDI by eliminating C. difficile from surfaces, in both healthcare and community based settings...|$|R

Methods: Disinfectant use was assessed by an occupational questionnaire in 9073 US female registered nurses without asthma, aged 49 – 68  years, drawn from the Nurses' Health Study II. A JEM was created based on self-reported frequency of use (1 – 3, 4 – 7  days/week) of 7 <b>disinfectants</b> and <b>sprays</b> in 8 nursing jobs. We then created a JTEM combining jobs and disinfection tasks to further reduce misclassification. Exposure was evaluated in 3 classes (low, medium, high) using product-specific cut-offs (eg, < 30 %, 30 – 49. 9 %, ≥ 50 %, respectively, for alcohol); the cut-offs were defined from the distribution of self-reported exposure per job/task. Results: The most frequently reported disinfectants were alcohol (weekly use: 39 %), bleach (22 %) and sprays (20 %). More nurses were classified as highly exposed by JTEM (alcohol 41 %, sprays 41 %, bleach 34 %) than by JEM (21 %, 30 %, 26 %, respectively). Agreement between JEM and JTEM was fair-to-moderate (κ 0. 3 – 0. 5) for most disinfectants. JEM and JTEM exposure estimates were heterogeneous in most nursing jobs, except in emergency room and education/administration.

Due to its strong antibacterial activity, nanosilver coatings are used on various textiles but as well as coatings on certain implants. Further, nanosilver is used for treatment of wounds and burns and marketed as a sanitary ware, water <b>disinfectant</b> and room <b>spray.</b> At this research, metallic silver was generated by ultraviolet radiation with 5 % PVP as a surfactant from AgNO 3. Sliver nanoparticles were precipitated in deionized water and sulfuric acid (2 M). Also, silver was doped on micro powder of Nepheline and micro/nanopowder of TiO 2, SiO 2 in both of environments. All samples were produced 30 litters homogeny suspension in stank industrially. The relationships between the antibacterial activity of powders and the fabrication conditions were investigated by X-ray diffraction, SEM and UV-visible spectrophotometer. Opposite of other papers, composites TiO 2 were the worst matrix, because TiO 2 was absorbed energy of UV radiation that were never perfected precipitation. Beside, antibacterial activity was very increase in acidic environment. After generated silver composites, they were coated on surfaces of raw glaze with spray. All kinds of tiles (floor, wall, opaque, luster etc) were cooked. Then, they were compared in basic and important tile factors (for examples: autoclave, corrosion and erosion resistant) after stabilized of tile conditions, they were compared them in antibacterial activity.

40|$|A {{total of}} 100 fluff samples were {{collected}} from five hatcheries located in and around Faisalabad. After isolation of different bacteria in the hatcheries fluff their sensitivity to Norfloxacin, Gentamicin, Flumequine, Chloramphenicol, Neomycin, Ampicillin and Erythromycin was determined. Similarly, the susceptibility of the bacterial isolates for three disinfectants (EWABO ALDEKOL, TH 4 and BROMOSEPT) and three spray sanitizers (Sani squad. Sanitol and TH 4) was also observed. The {{results indicated that the}} occurrence of different bacterial species among 148 isolates was: Escherichia coli 62 (41. 89 %), Paratyphoid salmonellae 24 (16. 22 %), Salmonella pullorum 3 (2. 03 %), Proteus mirabelis 2 (1. 35 %), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 4 (2. 70 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae 2 (1. 35 %), Streptococcus faecalis 4 (2. 70 %), Staphylococcus aureus 22 (14. 8 %), Staphylococcus epidermidis 7 (4. 73 %) and Bacillus subtilis 18 (12. 16 %). The in vitro sensitivity of the isolates was highest for Norfloxacin (91. 89 %) and the lowest for Erythromycin (16. 89 %). The bacterial isolates (Salmonella pullorum, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Streptococcus faecalis) were 100 percent susceptible for all the three <b>disinfectants.</b> Efficacy of <b>sprays</b> Sani Squad and TH 4 was 100 percent for some of the bacterial isolates e. g. Salmonella pullorum, Proteus mirabilis and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The efficacy of spray sanitol was more than 60 percent for some of the bacterial isolates including E. coli, Salmonella pullorum and Staphylococcus aureus) ...|$|R
