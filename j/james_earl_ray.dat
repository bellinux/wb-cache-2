40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{evaluate}} the circumstances surrounding the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in an attempt to provide evidence that the killing does meet the criteria of a conspiracy.

Drawing from a variety of sources published as early as 1970 and as recently as 2014, this paper ultimately concludes that there is sufficient evidence to support the notion that the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. does meet the criteria of a conspiracy involving more than just one person, despite the fact that the evidence does not present a clear picture of exactly who else was involved...|$|R
