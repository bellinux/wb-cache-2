5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} the study and {{modelling}} of {{the transfer of the}} inert <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> of breathing gases from the gas in the lungs to the tissues of the diver and back during exposure to variations in ambient pressure. In the case of underwater diving and compressed air work, this mostly involves ambient pressures greater than the local surface pressure—but astronauts, high altitude mountaineers, and occupants of unpressurized aircraft, are exposed to ambient pressures less than standard sea level atmospheric pressure. In all cases, the symptoms of decompression sickness occur during or within {{a relatively short period of}} hours, or occasionally days, after a significant reduction of ambient pressure.|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is achieved by increasing the fraction of oxygen in the breathing gas used, whereas substitution of a different inert gas will not produce the desired effect. Any substitution may introduce counter-diffusion complications, owing to differing rates of diffusion of the inert gases, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression, and up to 2.8 bar for therapeutic decompression.|$|E

25|$|The {{composition}} of the breathing gas during pressure exposure and decompression is significant in inert gas uptake and elimination for a given pressure exposure profile. Breathing gas mixtures for diving will typically have a different gas fraction of nitrogen to that of air. The partial pressure of each component gas will differ to that of nitrogen in air at any given depth, and uptake and elimination of each inert <b>gas</b> <b>component</b> {{is proportional to the}} actual partial pressure over time. The two foremost reasons for use of mixed breathing gases are the reduction of nitrogen partial pressure by dilution with oxygen, to make Nitrox mixtures, primarily to reduce the rate of nitrogen uptake during pressure exposure, and the substitution of helium (and occasionally other gases) for the nitrogen to reduce the narcotic effects under high partial pressure exposure. Depending on the proportions of helium and nitrogen, these gases are called Heliox if there is no nitrogen, or Trimix if there is nitrogen and helium along with the essential oxygen.|$|E

The inert gases used as substitutes for nitrogen have different solubility and diffusion characteristics in living tissues to the nitrogen they replace. For example, the most common inert gas diluent substitute for nitrogen is helium, which is significantly less soluble in living tissue, but also diffuses faster due to the relatively small size and mass of the He atom in comparison with the N2 molecule.|$|E

The pump (P 1) extracts the gas mixture, supplying it to a line (1) with sensors (2) for <b>gas</b> <b>component(s).</b> The flow then passes to an absorber (A 1), where it is mixed with basic, acidic and/or organic absorbent from storage (7). This takes specific <b>gas</b> <b>component(s)</b> into solution. The photometric cell(s) (Z 1) determine component concentration(s) from spectral measurements of the solution. A further unit records, processes and displays the measurement(s) USE - To measure gases produced e. g. {{at the site of}} a fire. ADVANTAGE - The system offers rapid, reliable and continuous or quasi-continuous operation. It determines numbers of organic and inorganic <b>gas</b> <b>components.</b> It has a low reagent consumption, noting that micropumps are used. The method improves on known, e. g. semiconductor, sensors used for quantitative measurement, by avoiding cross-sensitivities, i. e. each determination is component-specific.
