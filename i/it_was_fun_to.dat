5|$|The Flapper awoke {{from her}} {{lethargy}} of sub-deb-ism, bobbed her hair, {{put on her}} choicest pair of earrings {{and a great deal}} of audacity and rouge and went into the battle. She flirted because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> flirt and wore a one-piece bathing suit because she had a good figure... she was conscious that the things she did were the things she had always wanted to do. Mothers disapproved of their sons taking the Flapper to dances, to teas, to swim and most of all to heart.|$|E
5|$|The {{scenes in}} which Cole {{appeared}} on the ship were done by using a harness {{as if she was}} flying. Because the actress wore green dress and makeup, the normal greenscreen was replaced by bluescreens in the studio. Cole felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> fly on the harness, but found it painful after a few hours. Gillan was allowed to perform several of her own stunts in the episode. She was excited to learn that her character would fight pirates with swords, and was taught how to handle one with basic moves. Gillan was also allowed to swing across the ship. However, a stunt double was required to film the sequence where Amy is thrown across the deck by the Siren. The sickbay set was also built in a studio. Because the beds were attached to strings, they were prone to swaying. The cast members who were asked to lie on the beds were instructed to stay still and not breathe heavily to limit movement.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{commented on}} the surrealism of the Oscars experience: [...] "That's exactly what it was, surreal... I enjoy {{performing}} {{almost as much as}} I enjoy making up songs in the first place. But the Oscars was a very strange show, where the set was only one song cut down to less than two minutes, and the audience was {{a lot of people who}} didn't come to hear me play. I wouldn't want to live in that world, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> walk around on the moon for a day." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} cover {{versions of}} [...] "Smile" [...] by Lily Allen, [...] "Jump" [...] by Van Halen, [...] "Smile" [...] by Charlie Chaplin, and [...] "When You're Smiling" [...] by Louis Armstrong. Studio recordings {{of each of}} the songs except [...] "When You're Smiling" [...] were released as singles, available for digital download, and are also included on the album [...] Jenna Ushkowitz deemed [...] "Jump" [...] one of her favorite songs on the album, explaining that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> perform on mattresses and comparing it to [...] "Proud Mary", performed in the episode [...] "Wheels", which utilized wheelchairs as props.|$|E

500|$|Enter the Dominatrix {{received}} [...] "mixed or average reviews", {{according to}} video game review score aggregator Metacritic. Chris Schilling of Eurogamer, citing the game's development history, called Enter the Dominatrix [...] "a fascinating {{case study in}} how games evolve". Electronic Gaming Monthly Eric Patterson also commented on how downloadable content in the industry is seen as content pulled from the retail release to be sold as an addition, which Enter the Dominatrix development history flips on its head. He added that {{in all of his}} industry experience, he had never otherwise seen a developer purposefully let its fans play [...] "shelved" [...] content, and thus found the experience [...] "fascinating". Official Xbox Magazine Mikel Reparaz said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> see what [...] "could have been".|$|E
500|$|As {{teenagers}} {{were among}} the target audiences for the C5, some commentators also raised the prospect of (in Adamson and Kennedy's words) [...] "packs of 14-year-olds terrorising the neighbourhood in their customised C5s". The secretary of the Cyclists Touring Club raised the prospect of [...] "kids us them in a pretty wild way. They may run them over paths and pavements and knock people down." [...] Sinclair dismissed such concerns – [...] "I have qualms about seven-year-olds riding bicycles on the open road, but I have far fewer qualms about a 14-year-old driving one of these". Teenagers interviewed by The Guardian were doubtful about whether they would want a C5, commenting that while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> drive they felt insecure in it and preferred their bicycles.|$|E
500|$|... "Lisa's First Word" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Martin, and {{directed}} by Mark Kirkland. The Simpsons writers Mike Reiss and Al Jean were discussing about having an episode where Maggie would say her first word, and Reiss {{thought it would be}} cute to have her say [...] "daddy" [...] when no one could hear her. Jeff Martin was assigned to write the episode because he had done another flashback episode in the past, [...] "I Married Marge". Martin was excited to do another flashback episode because he thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> check out old newspapers and go back and see what was in the news back in 1983 and 1984. Martin felt it was a good way of finding a new set of things to make jokes about.|$|E

500|$|... "The Bishop Revival" [...] {{revealed}} that the seahorse shown in promotions since the series began {{was in fact a}} genetically encoded [...] "signature" [...] created by Walter's father Dr. Robert Bishop. In an interview after the episode's broadcast, consulting producer Akiva Goldsman cited [...] "The Bishop Revival" [...] when discussing the use of flashbacks in Fringe; he stated his disinclination to use too many flashbacks in the series, explaining [...] "I think flashbacks are really useful and {{there are a couple of}} places where it will be useful. But fundamentally, no, I don't think we're a show that will be doing a lot of jumping back in time despite the single horde of calls for the 'Walter's Grandfather Nazi Hunting' series. I think not, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> do [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{idea of a}} {{time travel}} thriller film {{originated}} between screenwriters Bill Marsilii and Terry Rossio, who communicated via email in attempts to develop the plot due to communication difficulties. However, the creation of Déjà Vus progenitor was set aside by the September 11, 2001 attacks that disrupted New York-native Marsilii, {{and the advent of}} the 2003 film , which occupied Los Angeles-native Rossio. However, by 2006, the two screenwriters had completed the concept. Brian Greene from Columbia University was brought in as a consultant to help create a scientifically plausible feel to the script. Greene stated [...] "the way I try to explain wormholes in terms of bending paper and connecting the corners, that's there in the film and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> see that that made it in." [...] The screenwriters submitted their work to Jerry Bruckheimer, who with Tony Scott were searching for new ideas for a feature film.|$|E
500|$|Michelle Morgan played [...] "FRAN", the [...] "Friendly Replicator Android". Morgan was {{originally}} set to play Linara, Davos' daughter {{from a previous}} episode, [...] "The Seer". However, the role was given to Kimberley Warnat when Morgan had {{to participate in a}} reshoot of her role in Diary of the Dead. Morgan was disappointed that she did not get the role of Linara, but stated after her casting as FRAN that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play a character that is highly dangerous and yet completely innocent. Jill Wagner returned as Larrin for this episode, after her debut appearance in [...] "Travelers". Torri Higginson returned as Elizabeth Weir in her fourth appearance in the season, {{at the very end of}} the episode. The script intended her to have two lines of dialog in the episode, but producers knew that the audience would recognize Higginson's voice and hence used a stand-in to say the first line instead.|$|E

500|$|Rob Fitzpatrick of NME {{characterized}} Beyoncé's {{breathing heavily}} while grabbing the [...] "imaginary" [...] bedsheets but remained a [...] "devout young Christian woman singing {{what the public}} wants her to sing." [...] Describing [...] "Naughty Girl" [...] as an uptempo party track, Lisa Verrico of The Times commented that the song features [...] "an unusually high-pitched Beyoncé singing lines such as 'The rhythm's got me going crazy'". Neil Drumming of Entertainment Weekly found Beyoncé's singing [...] "not quite convincingly a naughty girl". This was echoed by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times who said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> hear Beyoncé mimicking [...] "the pizzicato line" [...] in [...] "Naughty Girl", {{and that it was}} not much fun to hear her try to sing [...] "like a naughty girl". Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic commented that [...] "Storch does his most convincing imitation of the Neptunes writing their own Kashmir in a Middle Eastern restaurant".|$|E
500|$|Kyle Busch {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first victory of the season; the win earned him $198,550. He said, [...] "I don't {{know how many times}} I spun out and didn't spin out. Amazing race. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> drive when I wasn't getting turned around", and, [...] "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have been there a little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." [...] Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, [...] "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly said he {{was surprised}} by the complexity of [...] "200" [...] and the amount of South Park references and subplots it encompassed, especially the questions over Cartman's father. Tucker praised the episode, and said, [...] "With jokes raining down like hell-fire, the 200th episode spared no one except the South Park kids themselves." [...] Ramsey Isler of IGN said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> identify all the references to past South Park moments, but felt [...] "200" [...] itself didn't stand out as a great episode. Isler said the new material wasn't very funny, and that the rehashed material was not as funny as the first time they were shown, which was disappointing due to the hype surrounding the episode. The A.V. Club writer Sean O'Neal said the episode was funny, but that the original material was far outnumbered by rehashed jokes. O'Neal said the use of all the celebrities demonstrated how South Park had been more original in early episodes, but now had [...] "morph into something whose default mode is mocking famous people in the news".|$|E

500|$|Not all reviews were so critical. Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed {{awarded the}} episode 4 out of 5 stars. Although {{he noted that}} the episode was [...] "not Gilligan's best work" [...] and that the writing was [...] "a little spotty", he said [...] "the vibe [...] is very well done." [...] Tom Kessenich, in his book Examinations, gave the episode a {{moderately}} positive review, writing [...] "My heart wasn't racing and I wasn't {{sitting on the edge of}} my seat as Mulder and Scully unmasked our two magicians [...] But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> put the clues together to see what it all added up to." [...] Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and wrote that he [...] "love it". He praised the episode's [...] "good-naturedness", which he felt was due to Mulder and Scully's interaction. Handlen also enjoyed the writing, noting that the [...] "script also does a good job at doling out its secrets in a way that never makes either the magicians or our heroes come off as idiots". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, describing it as a [...] "rather fun tale".|$|E
500|$|Kylie and Becky's {{characterisation}} and backstory are similar. Lane felt it {{was important}} to portray certain differences between the two. This was to prevent the audience becoming bored through repetition. This was done through Kylie making the opposite choice Becky would make. In April2011 Lane further described her as [...] "volatile" [...] because [...] "you never know what she'll do next." [...] Kylie proved to be unpredictable. Lane admitted <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> play her because [...] "It's difficult to imagine how she will react to things." [...] Through her relationships she is shown to be a [...] "" [...] who wants to have fun and has [...] "the bottle for anything." [...] One of Kylie's main motivations in life is money and she develops a taste for better things in life. Lane also predicted that Kylie would do anything [...] "if the price was right." [...] Lane opined that everyone's perception of Kylie is [...] "she's conniving and only out for what she can get." [...] Kylie gained such a reputation as a trouble-maker that Lane was often asked by members of the public to behave herself. Lane describes Kylie's redeeming qualities the fact she is [...] "bright and she's a grafter." ...|$|E
500|$|Producers {{identified}} {{the scene in}} which Elsa sings [...] "Let It Go" [...] as a pivotal point in the character's development. The scene depicts her choice to [...] "let go" [...] of her fear of using her powers. Character design supervisor Bill Schwab said, [...] "Before 'Let It Go', Elsa is really buttoned up, her hair is up—everything is perfect. During the song, she gives herself permission to be who she is and everything changes—her hair is more wild, her gown is magical. She's finally free—even if she is all alone." [...] Animators designed Elsa's appearance to reflect her metamorphosis; in the beginning, she is shown primarily in restrictive and confining outfits. Menzel said that, after accepting her abilities, Elsa's appearance becomes [...] "very vampy", continuing, [...] "She's quite sexy for Disney, I have to say—they're pushing the limits there a little bit! But there's a gleam in her eye and a supermodel walk {{that goes with it}} and, for me, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>fun</b> <b>to</b> be a blonde because I'm not in real life." [...] In a January 2014 interview with John August and Aline Brosh McKenna, Lee disclosed that Lasseter personally helped with conceptualizing Elsa's physical transformation: [...] "y favorite thing about it ... is the actual model for doing it was John Lasseter .... he was a huge help in talking through how we translate that emotional journey ... with the animation ... e got up and he’s like, .... 'her hair goes, and she transforms, and she struts,' and he’s doing it. He’s acting it out." ...|$|E
