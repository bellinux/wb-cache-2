5|$|BioWare's Baldur's Gate {{series was}} no less important, the most {{significant}} D series to be released since the Gold Box era.

Baldur's Gate (1998) provided an epic story with NPC <b>followers</b> <b>and</b> written dialogue that continued through both titles and two expansion packs.

5|$|In 1066, William, the Duke of Normandy, took {{advantage}} of the English succession crisis to invade. With an army of Norman <b>followers</b> <b>and</b> mercenaries, he defeated Harold at the battle of Hastings and rapidly occupied the south of England. William used a network of castles to control the major centres of power, granting extensive lands to his main Norman <b>followers</b> <b>and</b> co-opting or eliminating the former Anglo-Saxon elite. Major revolts followed, which William suppressed before intervening in the north-east of England, establishing Norman control of York and devastating the region. Some Norman lords used England as a launching point for attacks into South and North Wales, spreading up the valleys to create new Marcher territories. By the time of William's death in 1087, England formed the largest part of an Anglo-Norman empire, ruled over by a network of nobles with landholdings across England, Normandy, and Wales. England's growing wealth was critical in allowing the Norman kings to project power across the region, including funding campaigns along the frontiers of Normandy.|$|E

5|$|In pre-Islamic Arabia, a time {{known as}} jahiliyyah, the Kaaba became {{surrounded}} by pagan idols.

In 632 CE, Muhammad performed his only and last pilgrimage {{with a large number}} of <b>followers,</b> <b>and</b> instructed them on the rites of Hajj.

5|$|The {{belief of}} many {{followers}} that their founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B. Williams, Swaminarayan was criticized because he received large gifts from his <b>followers</b> <b>and</b> dressed and traveled as a Maharaja {{even though he had}} taken the vows of renunciation of the world. Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E

The other theory holds that Ljotić was buried in Šempeter pri Gorici until the signing of the Treaty of Osimo in 1977, when his followers removed his body from the tomb in which it was buried and took it to an unknown location outside Yugoslavia, possibly to Italy.|$|E
5|$|Following this, a gift {{made by the}} Grand Prince to Davyd Igorevich, which {{included}} land in Volhynia and control of trade with the Byzantine Empire, {{is said to have}} made Yaropolk hostile to the Grand Prince.

Lacking confidence in his own resources, Yaropolk fled Volhynia to Poland, leaving his <b>followers</b> (<b>and</b> mother) at Lutsk.

5|$|From late August 1869 to May the {{following}} year, Levski {{was active in}} the Romanian capital Bucharest. He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov, whose participation in the foundation of the Bulgarian Literary Society Levski approved in writing. Karavelov's publications gathered a number of <b>followers</b> <b>and</b> initiated the foundation of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), a centralised revolutionary diasporic organisation that included Levski as a founding member and statute drafter. In disagreement over planning, Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and began to put into action his concept of an internal revolutionary network.|$|E
5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous hand-picked <b>followers</b> <b>and</b> organized {{them into}} {{about a dozen}} different circles, each group of supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E

Louis returned at the end of April, but his northern forces were defeated by William Marshal at the Battle of Lincoln in May.|$|E
