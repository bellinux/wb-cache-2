Sequence analysis and taxonomy are two major fields of application of bioinformatics.

We evaluate the performance of our approach on publicly available human genomic data. The simulation results confirm that the context trees can be effectively used to detect similar <b>genetic</b> <b>sequences</b> while guaranteeing high privacy levels.

5|$|The <b>genetic</b> <b>sequence</b> {{information}} from A.bisporigera {{has been used}} to identify molecular polymorphisms in the related A.phalloides. These single-nucleotide polymorphisms may be used as population genetic markers to study phylogeography and population genetics. Sequence information has also been employed to show that A.bisporigera lacks many of the major classes of secreted enzymes that break down the complex polysaccharides of plant cell walls, like cellulose. In contrast, saprobic fungi like Coprinopsis cinerea and Galerina marginata, which break down organic matter to obtain nutrients, have a more complete complement of cell wall-degrading enzymes. Although few ectomycorrhizal fungi have yet been tested in this way, the authors suggest that the absence of plant cell wall-degrading ability may correlate with the ectomycorrhizal ecological niche.|$|E

In other words, this method assumes that the ancestral states are those which are statistically most likely, given the observed phenotypes.

2500|$|Although cells undergo {{multiple}} {{steps in}} order to ensure there are no mutations in the <b>genetic</b> <b>sequence,</b> sometimes specific deletions and other genetic changes during Okazaki fragment maturation go unnoticed. Because Okazaki fragments are the set of nucleotides for the lagging strand, any alteration including deletions, insertions, or duplications from the original strand can cause a mutation if it is not detected and fixed. Other causes of mutations include problems with the proteins that aid in DNA replication. [...] For example, a mutation related to primase affects RNA primer removal and can make the DNA strand more fragile and susceptible to breaks. Another mutation concerns polymerase α, which impairs the editing of the Okazaki fragment sequence and incorporation of the protein into the genetic material. Both alterations can lead to chromosomal aberrations, unintentional genetic rearrangement, and a variety of cancers later in life.|$|E
40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of founder <b>genetic</b> <b>sequences</b> {{of a population}} is a relevant issue in evolutionary biology research. The problem consists in finding a biologically plausible set of <b>genetic</b> <b>sequences</b> (founders), which can be recombined to obtain the <b>genetic</b> <b>sequences</b> of the individuals of a given population. The {{reconstruction of}} these sequences can be modelled as a combinatorial optimisation problem in which one has to find a set of <b>genetic</b> <b>sequences</b> such that the individuals of the population under study {{can be obtained by}} recombining founder sequences minimising the number of recombinations. This problem is called the founder sequence reconstruction problem. Solving this problem can contribute to research in understanding the origins of specific genotypic traits. In this paper, we present large neighbourhood search algorithms to tackle this problem. The proposed algorithms combine a stochastic local search with a branch-and-bound algorithm devoted to neighbourhood exploration. The developed algorithms are thoroughly evaluated on three different benchmark sets and they establish the new state of the art for realistic problem instances. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

2500|$|These {{approaches}} {{employ the}} same probabilistic framework as used to infer the phylogenetic tree. In brief, {{the evolution of}} a <b>genetic</b> <b>sequence</b> is modelled by a time-reversible continuous time Markov process. In the simplest of these, all characters undergo independent state transitions (such as nucleotide substitutions) at a constant rate over time. This basic model is frequently extended to allow different rates on each branch of the tree. In reality, mutation rates may also vary over time (due, for example, to environmental changes); this can be modelled by allowing the rate parameters to evolve along the tree, at the expense of having an increased number of parameters. A model defines transition probabilities from states i to j along a branch of length t (in units of evolutionary time). The likelihood of a phylogeny is computed from a nested sum of transition probabilities that corresponds to the hierarchical structure of the proposed tree. [...] At each node, the likelihood of its descendants is summed over all possible ancestral character states at that node: ...|$|E
2500|$|Ancestral {{reconstruction}} (also {{known as}} Character Mapping or Character Optimization) is the extrapolation {{back in time}} from measured characteristics of individuals (or populations) to their common ancestors. [...] It is an important application of phylogenetics, the reconstruction and study of the evolutionary relationships among individuals, populations or species to their ancestors. In the context of evolutionary biology, ancestral reconstruction {{can be used to}} recover different kinds of ancestral character states of organisms that lived millions of years ago. These states include the <b>genetic</b> <b>sequence</b> (ancestral sequence reconstruction), the amino acid sequence of a protein, the composition of a genome (e.g., gene order), a measurable characteristic of an organism (phenotype), and the geographic range of an ancestral population or species (ancestral range reconstruction). This is desirable because it allows us to examine parts of phylogenetic trees corresponding to the distant past, clarifying the evolutionary history of the species in the tree. Since modern genetic sequences are essentially a variation of ancient ones, access to ancient sequences may identify other variations and organisms which could have arisen from those sequences. In addition to genetic sequences, one might attempt to track the changing of one character trait to another, such as fins turning to legs.|$|E

[...] Mesquite provides ancestral state reconstruction methods for both discrete and continuous characters using both maximum parsimony and maximum likelihood methods. [...] It also provides several visualization tools for interpreting the results of ancestral reconstruction. [...] MEGA is a modular system, too, but places greater emphasis on ease-of-use than customization of analyses. [...] As of version 5, MEGA allows the user to reconstruct ancestral states using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood, and empirical Bayes methods.|$|E
