5|$|Brussels' hosting of {{institutions}} {{has made it}} a major centre for the EU. Together with NATO it has attracted more journalists and ambassadors than Washington D.C. However the three-city agreement has been criticised, notably concerning the Parliament due to {{the large number of}} people that move between the cities. The European Green Party estimated that the arrangement costs 200million euro and 20,268 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Brussels is preferred by some due to the presence of other institutions and other groups whereas Strasbourg is supported due to its historical importance to <b>European</b> <b>unity.</b>|$|E

50|$|In August 1552, weary {{from three}} decades of {{religious}} civil war, Charles guaranteed Lutheran religious freedoms in the Peace of Passau. The implementation of the Augsburg Interim was cancelled. The Protestant princes taken prisoner during the Schmalkaldic War, John Frederick of Saxony and Philip of Hesse, were released. A precursor to the Peace of Augsburg of September 1555, the Peace of Passau effectively surrendered Charles V's lifelong quest for <b>European</b> religious <b>unity.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{project was}} to assure Germany's allies that their {{independence}} would be respected after the war, and also to give impression to the Soviets and the Western Allies that all of Europe stood united in defiance, and that the Allies were not fighting for the liberation of European states, but against <b>European</b> <b>unity,</b> rendering thus American and British anti-German propaganda powerless. A clear call for the confederation would also allow the Germans to recruit more men for the Waffen-SS from the occupied countries, and {{to force them to}} bolster their war effort in personal and material spheres. Also, the confederation would deter the neutral countries of Europe from siding with the Allied camp.|$|E
25|$|The United Kingdom {{insisted on}} special {{status as a}} longstanding belligerent during the war, {{concerned}} {{that if it were}} treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and <b>European</b> <b>unity</b> to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by William L. Clayton, promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to spend too much of the money on Germany. However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.|$|E
25|$|During his kingship, Juan Carlos {{followed}} {{a foreign policy}} during {{the first decade of}} his kingship coined Reencounter and Reconciliation, which greatly improved Spain's standing on the world stage. The king reconciled long standing historic tensions with the Netherlands and cultivated relationships with France and Germany which led directly to Spain's entry into the European Community and into NATO. Following the tensions between Franco and the Papacy over the reforms of the Second Vatican Council, Juan Carlos' personal relations with successive popes greatly improved diplomatic relations between the Holy See and Spain, and with Pope Paul VI blessing Juan Carlos' democratic reforms. According to historian Charles Powell, it was the king's goal to win Spain's full acceptance by other European powers. The king, a self-described Europeanist, was awarded the prestigious Charlemagne Award in 1982 for his steadfast work towards democracy and for supporting <b>European</b> <b>unity.</b> The constitution gives the monarch special responsibility in promoting Spanish relations with members of its historic community, the nations formerly part of the Spanish Empire and also relations with Portugal and Brazil. Fulfilling this responsibility, the King of Spain serves as president of the twenty-four member Ibero-American States Organization. With his support of democracy, various elements within Ibero-America political society have sought the king's advice on how to transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. For his efforts, by 2008 the king was voted the most popular leader in all of the Ibero-America community.|$|E

500|$|If the Parliament was wholly in Strasbourg, {{then the}} news media would also {{no longer be able}} to use shortcuts such as [...] "Brussels decided..."

Strasbourg is also preferred for historical reasons, having changed hands between France and Germany five times between 1870 and 1945.

500|$|In France, Schuman {{had gained}} strong {{political}} and intellectual support from all {{sections of the}} nation and many non-communist parties. Notable amongst these were ministerial colleague Andre Philip, president of the Foreign Relations Committee Edouard Bonnefous, and former prime minister, Paul Reynaud. Projects for a coal and steel authority and other supranational communities were formulated in specialist subcommittees of the Council of Europe in the period before it became French government policy. Charles de Gaulle, who was then out of power, had been an early supporter of [...] "linkages" [...] between economies, on French terms, and had spoken in 1945 of a [...] "European confederation" [...] that would exploit the resources of the Ruhr. However, he opposed the ECSC as a faux (false) pooling ("le pool, ce faux semblant") because he considered it an unsatisfactory [...] "piecemeal approach" [...] to <b>European</b> <b>unity</b> and because he considered the French government [...] "too weak" [...] to dominate the ECSC as he thought proper. De Gaulle also felt that the ECSC had insufficient supranational authority because the Assembly was not ratified by a European referendum and he did not accept Raymond Aron's contention that the ECSC was intended as a movement away from United States domination. Consequently, de Gaulle and his followers in the RPF voted against ratification in the lower house of the French Parliament.|$|E

2500|$|Jean Omer Marie Gabriel Monnet ( [...] ; 9 November 1888 – 16 March 1979) was a French {{political}} {{economist and}} diplomat.

Jean Monnet has been called “The Father of Europe” by those who see his innovative and pioneering efforts in the 1950s as the key to establishing the European Coal and Steel Community, the predecessor of today’s European Union. Never elected to public office, Monnet worked behind the scenes of American and European governments as a well-connected pragmatic internationalist.

As subsistence agriculture declined in the 1940s, it was replaced by poultry and dairy farming, and seasonal camps were built along the lake shore.|$|R
