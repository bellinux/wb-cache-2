2500|$|On 31 October 1969, 29-year-old Helen Puttock {{was found}} murdered in Earl Street in Scotstoun. She {{had also been}} to the Barrowland Ballroom on the night she was murdered; she had gone there with her sister, Jean, and had met two men called John. One said he was from Castlemilk while the other did not {{disclose}} where he was from. After being in their company for well over an hour, they left to head home. Castlemilk John walked to George Square to get a bus, while Helen, Jean and the killer hailed a taxi. They set off from Glasgow Cross and made a westward journey heading to Knightswood where Jean lived. It was during this journey {{that most of the}} crucial information about the killer became apparent. More significant were the conversations in the taxi that would later be used to create a psychological profile of the killer. Jean told detectives that he was a well-spoken man who quoted from the Bible. It was this information that led to the killer being given the nickname [...] "Bible John" [...] by the media. After dropping off Jean at Knightswood, the taxi then continued to Earl Street in Scotstoun where Helen lived. The next morning, Helen's battered body was found in the back garden of her flat in Earl Street. She had been raped and strangled. The contents of her handbag had been scattered nearby but the actual bag was missing. It has been suggested that the killer took the bag as a trophy. Grass stains on Helen's feet indicated {{that there had been a}} struggle in which Helen probably tried to escape her killer. She also had a <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> mark on her leg.|$|E
60|$|So now he {{made sure}} that a tree was going to fall clear and just where he wanted it. Then he sat up on his hind legs, and with his great broad tail for a brace, began to make the chips fly. You know Paddy has the most {{wonderful}} teeth for cutting. They are long and broad and sharp. He would begin by making a <b>deep</b> <b>bite,</b> and then another just a little way below. Then he would pry out the little piece of wood between. When he had cut very deep on one side so that the tree would fall that way, he would work {{around to the other}} side. Just as soon as the tree began to lean and he was sure {{that it was going to}} fall, he would scamper away so as to be out of danger. He loved to see those tall trees lean forward slowly, then faster and faster, till they struck the ground with a crash.|$|E

50|$|The Dhaliwal {{brothers}} received <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> and claw wounds {{on their}} heads, necks, arms, and hands. Their injuries were not life-threatening, {{and they were}} {{released from the hospital}} on December 29, 2007.|$|R
5000|$|In August, 1979, {{a coyote}} {{attacked}} a 5-year-old La Verne girl. Her {{father and a}} neighbor saved the child from being dragged off, but not before she had suffered <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> on neck, head, and legs.|$|R
60|$|He still sat on; and Felix, in {{intolerable}} wrath and vexation, {{found himself}} making such <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> into a pencil, that he threw {{it from him}} with shame, just as Mr. Audley's bell sounded, and he ran down to let him in.|$|R

50|$|This type of {{intrusion}} {{consists of}} extrusion of posterior teeth {{to correct the}} <b>deep</b> <b>bite.</b> The anterior incisors do not move up or down {{in this type of}} intrusion. Relative intrusion can be done with various methods such as using a reverse curve of spee wires, anterior bite blocks, differential molar eruption with functional appliances such as Twin Block Appliance. This type of movement can be performed in patients who are adolescents and have <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> tendency.|$|E
50|$|Cases {{in which}} the Pre-Eruption Guidance process would be {{beneficial}} include improvement of dental alignment and correction of a functional occlusion (severe <b>deep</b> <b>bite,</b> severe overjet, constricted maxillary width, blocked out maxillary cuspids, lower crowding).|$|E
25|$|Sneak attack – The victim {{will not}} usually see the shark, and may sustain {{multiple}} <b>deep</b> <b>bites.</b> This kind of attack is predatory {{in nature and}} is often carried out {{with the intention of}} consuming the victim. It is extraordinarily rare for this to occur.|$|R
50|$|After retreating, {{the tiger}} sat, {{studying}} how effective the previous tussle was. Atlas was mauled, {{but not yet}} killed, with two long rips on his back, having <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> to the shoulder, which bled, and he panted hoarsely, with the wind flowing less evidently {{than that of the}} tiger.|$|R
50|$|Capnocytophaga canimorsus {{transmission}} {{following a}} dog bite can cause overwhelming sepsis in asplenic patients, the elderly, and the immunocompromised. Empiric treatment for these bacteria following a dog bite, {{consisting of a}} third-generation cephalosporin early in the infection, should be instituted in these patient populations, or following <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> or dog bites to the hand.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} {{unfavorable}} sequel of serial extraction is deepening of bite. Uprighting of incisors and early loss of posterior teeth {{may result in}} <b>deep</b> <b>bite.</b> A simple palatal bite plate may correct this problem.|$|E

30|$|Lots of {{differences}} between open and <b>deep</b> skeletal <b>bite</b> patients have been underlined by {{the analysis of the}} electromyographic data obtained. These results have been obtained with both electromyographic systems.

50|$|Young {{children}} commonly have a <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> (excessive overbite), it is {{not resolved}} during the normal growth of the maxilla and the mandible and can get worse with time. If {{it is not}} corrected it may lead to trauma and shortening {{the length of the}} teeth due to wear and the biting edges.|$|E
50|$|She finally passed out, {{after her}} attacker. Upon waking she said, “The law will {{get their hands}} on you!” Because his Klan {{connections}} gave him tremendous political power, Stephenson laughed and replied, “I am the law in Indiana.” An examination of her body later revealed <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> wounds were on her face, neck, breasts, back, legs, ankles, and tongue.|$|E
50|$|This {{modification}} {{was done}} by Erich and Annette Fleisher. In this appliance the acrylic was reduced in size and a lower bite plane was included which was made out of metal wires to correct the <b>deep</b> <b>bite.</b> The transpalata bar opens in the distal direction as Class 3 appliance. It had separate maxillary and mandibular labial bow wire.|$|E
50|$|Dental braces (also {{known as}} braces, {{orthodontic}} cases, or cases) are devices used in orthodontics that align and straighten teeth and help position them {{with regard to}} a person's bite, while also aiming to improve dental health. They are often used to correct underbites, as well as malocclusions, overbites, open <b>bites,</b> <b>deep</b> <b>bites,</b> cross bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic or structural. Dental braces are often {{used in conjunction with}} other orthodontic appliances to help widen the palate or jaws and to otherwise assist in shaping the teeth and jaws.|$|R
40|$|AbstractUniqueness of {{this case}} report is that though {{coronary}} cameral fistulas are itself rare, we closed fistula effectively in a different way. Since surgery was only good option available as patient had concomitant valvular disease, we closed distal end of fistula in PA and then took <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> of suture in fistulous track itself. This approach closed fistula effectively {{and we had no}} need to dissect and ligate its origin from LAD which is more arduous and dangerous task...|$|R
30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare electromyographic data of two groups of {{patients}} (open and <b>deep</b> skeletal <b>bite)</b> before and after surgical orthodontic treatment.|$|R
50|$|Communication {{can vary}} greatly among {{individual}} cats. Some cats {{interact with other}} cats more easily than other cats. In a family with many cats, the interactions can change depending on which individuals are present and how restricted the territory and resources are. One or more individuals may become aggressive: fighting may occur with the attack resulting in scratches and <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> wounds.|$|E
50|$|Although {{generally}} docile and inactive when handled, {{males are}} usually {{more aggressive than}} females when caught, and in one case a scientist received a <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> in his finger. Unlike their relatives (beaded lizards, gila monster and some monitor lizards), there were no indication of venom in the bite, supporting earlier dissection studies where no venom glands or grooves in the teeth were found.|$|E
50|$|In {{these types}} of cases, a patient has reduced {{anterior}} lower facial height {{and they have a}} skeletal <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> tendency. It is essential in these type of patients, to increase the vertical height of the face {{and one of the most}} common ways this can be performed is through relative intrusion. This movement involves extrusion of the posterior molars and is sometimes combined with intrusion of anterior incisors.|$|E
30|$|MYH {{is found}} in all {{eukaryotic}} cells, where it provides the motor function [29]. There are several types of MYH, {{and they can be}} classified by their contraction speed as fast type and slow type [29]. MYH 2 is fast type [30]. Masticatory muscle fibers can adapt to stress by changing their myosin composition, and they are found after orthognathic surgery of patients with malocclusions [31, 32]. The patients having mandibular asymmetry are associated with a significant increase of MYH 2 [33]. In addition, MYH 2 occupancy is increased in <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> [34].|$|R
500|$|Favoring {{offshore}} {{waters and}} thus seldom encountered by humans, the cookiecutter shark {{is not considered}} very dangerous because of its small size. However, it has been implicated in a few attacks; in one notable case, a school of fierce, [...] long fish with blunt snouts attacked an underwater photographer on an open ocean dive. Similar reports have come from shipwreck survivors, of suffering small, clean, <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> during night time. In March 2009, Maui resident Mike Spalding was bitten by a cookiecutter shark while swimming across Alenuihaha Channel. There are several records of bodies recovered from the water with post-mortem cookiecutter shark bites.|$|R
30|$|The {{incision}} {{was closed}} using interrupted absorbable sutures by intracorporeal suturing. The sutures used were either 1 – 0 polyglycolic acid (Dexon II, Tyco Healthcare, Norwalk, CT) or polyglactin 910 (Vicryl, Ethicon, India). We sutured the myometrium in one layer using curved needles, which enable <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> on the myometrium to be taken. These were seromuscular, evenly spaced around a centimeter apart, and {{the edges of}} the uterine wound were always everted. This is the technique similar to the one described by Dubuisson et al. [8]. If the endometrial cavity was entered, it was closed in a separate layer, avoiding the endometrium.|$|R
50|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{involving the}} sensitive neck {{is that the}} cat simply restrained the animal and then bit the neck, without much specificity to location, to cause major blood damage and then retreated to allow the animal to bleed to death. Stipulations include not biting {{the back of the}} neck where contact with vertebrae could break the teeth, but a <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> anywhere in the neck would prove fatal.|$|E
50|$|As the mandibular {{teeth are}} biting {{on the upper}} brackets, it results in an {{anterior}} bite plane effect. This eventually leads to the light, continuous intruding force that is being felt on the front incisors. This bite plane effect may also induce slight opening in the posterior molar teeth and these teeth may extrude, leading to correction of <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> or worsening of an already open bite. This can worsen a Class 2 malocclusion as mandible rotates down and back, leading to more of a Class 2 molar relationship.|$|E
50|$|Norman William Kingsley was {{the first}} person to try to move the maxillary teeth {{backwards}} in 1892 by means of headgear. Albin Oppenheim later advocated for the use of occipital anchorage to move the maxillary teeth backwards. Earlier into the field of orthodontics, molar teeth would be distalized with the use of headgears. Straight Pull (Combination) Headgear for translation of molar distally, Cervical Pull Headgear for extrusive and distalization of teeth in <b>deep</b> <b>bite</b> Class 2 patients and High Pull Headgear for intrusive and distalization of teeth in an open bite patient.|$|E
30|$|Surgery-first {{approach}} (SFA) {{is a term}} {{applied to}} the approach in orthognathic surgery where the pre-surgical orthodontic phase is totally obviated. The surgical procedure is conducted without any alignment or leveling of the arches, and orthodontic treatment is initiated a short period after the osteotomies. Liou et al. [8] described the guidelines for candidates to receive this type of approach. Almost every type of malocclusion and dentofacial deformity {{has been reported to}} be amenable to treatment with SFA. Published reports include surgery first for class II, class III, <b>deep</b> <b>bites,</b> open bites, and asymmetries. However, the majority of the published cases involve patients with class III malocclusions [9 – 11].|$|R

5000|$|Arthur J. Wilcock, {{along with}} Raymond Begg, created the [...] "Australian archwire" [...] in the 1940s in Australia. He was a {{metallurgist}} from Victoria, Australia. This archwire was prominently used {{in what is}} known as Begg Technique. Begg was seeking a stainless steel wire that was light, flexible stayed active {{for long periods of time}} in the mouth. The wire had high resiliency and toughness and were heat treated. The initial wire produced had dimension of 0.018in. These wires are often used in the treatment of <b>deep</b> <b>bites</b> because of their increased resistance to permanent deformation. The wire is composed of Iron (64%), Chromium (17%), Nickel (12%) and others.|$|R
