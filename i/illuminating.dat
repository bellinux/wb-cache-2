5|$|Before {{the early}} Netherlandish period, divine light {{was not well}} described: if a painter wanted to depict heavenly radiance, he {{typically}} painted an object in reflective gold. There was a focus on describing the object itself rather than {{the effect of the}} light as it fell across it. Van Eyck {{was one of the first}} to portray light's saturation, <b>illuminating</b> effects and gradations as it poured across the pictorial space. He detailed how an object's colour could vary depending on the amount and type of light <b>illuminating</b> it. This play of light is evident across the panel, and especially seen on Mary's gilded dress and jewelled crown, across her hair and on her mantle.|$|E

25|$|Albuquerque {{boasts a}} unique {{nighttime}} cityscape. Many building exteriors are <b>illuminated</b> in vibrant colors such as green and blue. The Wells Fargo Building is <b>illuminated</b> green. The DoubleTree Hotel and the Compass Bank building are <b>illuminated</b> blue. The rotunda {{of the county}} courthouse is <b>illuminated</b> yellow, while {{the tops of the}} Bank of Albuquerque and the Bank of the West are <b>illuminated</b> reddish-yellow. Due {{to the nature of the}} soil in the Rio Grande Valley, the skyline is lower than might be expected in a city of comparable size elsewhere.|$|R
40|$|Shadowed {{contour lines}} vary line width. <b>Illuminated</b> contour lines {{additionally}} vary color {{based on an}} angle of illumination. <b>Illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines {{date back to the}} midnineteenth century, but their effectiveness compared to conventional contour lines has not been fully examined. Currently, <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines are not widely used in computer-based cartography because they are not included in most GIS apmaking software. This article introduces improvements to existing algorithms for creating <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines from digital elevation data. A software package is made available to allow mapmakers to more easily make customized <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour maps. A user study comparing <b>illuminated</b> and shadowed contour lines to conventional contour lines and shaded relief with approximately 400 participants was conducted. Results indicate that map-readers can interpret relative height differences between points better and quicker with <b>illuminated</b> contour lines than regular contour lines or shaded relief. Study participants were able to select absolute maxima on an unlabeled <b>illuminated</b> contour map and a labeled regular contour map with equal accuracy and speed. These findings suggest that <b>illuminated</b> contour lines could be used more frequently for improved visualization of terrain and other surface data on maps...|$|R
5|$|As if {{struck by}} a blow, one {{suddenly}} recognizes the scientific futility, the biological senselessness, and the social noxiousness of views and institutions, which until that moment had seemed altogether natural and self-evident. It {{is a kind of}} eschatological experience so frequently encountered in a pathological form in schizophrenics. I might even voice the belief that the schizophrenic form of psychic illness is regularly accompanied by <b>illuminating</b> insight into the irrationalism of social and political mores.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, Glowee, a French company {{started selling}} bioluminescent lights, {{targeting}} shop fronts and municipal street signs as their main markets. France has {{a law that}} forbids retailers and offices from <b>illuminating</b> their windows between 1 and 7 {{in the morning in}} order to minimise energy consumption and pollution. Glowee hoped their product would get around this ban. They used bacteria called Aliivibrio fischeri which glow in the dark, but the maximum lifetime of their product was three days.|$|E
5|$|The Fizeau {{interferometer}} {{is shown}} {{as it might}} be set up to test an optical flat. A precisely figured reference flat is placed on top of the flat being tested, separated by narrow spacers. The reference flat is slightly beveled (only a fraction of a degree of beveling is necessary) to prevent the rear surface of the flat from producing interference fringes. Separating the test and reference flats allows the two flats to be tilted with respect to each other. By adjusting the tilt, which adds a controlled phase gradient to the fringe pattern, one can control the spacing and direction of the fringes, so that one may obtain an easily interpreted series of nearly parallel fringes rather than a complex swirl of contour lines. Separating the plates, however, necessitates that the <b>illuminating</b> light be collimated. Fig6 shows a collimated beam of monochromatic light <b>illuminating</b> the two flats and a beam splitter allowing the fringes to be viewed on-axis.|$|E

5|$|The pagoda {{was then}} {{completed}} {{by his son}} King Kyansittha (r.1084–1113). While its lower terraces were built by Anawrahta, the balance structure is credited to Kyansittha. Its final completion date is 1086 and the footprints below the four standing Buddha statues here are also believed {{to be of the}} same period. The pagoda is a replica of the pyramidal Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya, the location of Buddha’s <b>illuminating</b> realisation in India.|$|E
5|$|Hammer {{was awarded}} the Elliott Cresson Gold Medal from the Franklin Institute for his {{collection}} in 1906. The General Electric Company bought the collection from Hammer in 1912 for $10,000. It then was donated to the Edison Association of <b>Illuminating</b> Companies. The collection was put into a formal display room in 1913 at the Headquarters of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers in New York City. The display information for each Case is how it existed in 1913 after Hammer had collected these light bulbs for 34 years. In 1931 the light bulb collection had an estimated value of over a million dollars.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 9 - 10) This {{study was}} designed to compare the <b>illuminated</b> surface areas of HID and tungstenhalogen low-beam headlamps in the U. S. A sample of 20 tungsten-halogen lamps and 17 HID lamps for model year 2000 vehicles in the U. S. was examined. The <b>illuminated</b> surface area was determined using a modified version of an ECE method for evaluating the <b>illuminated</b> surface of signaling devices. The main finding is that the HID low beams generally have smaller <b>illuminated</b> surface areas than do the tungsten-halogen low beams. Because smaller light sources result in more discomfort glare (presumably via greater luminance), the present finding suggests that the smaller <b>illuminated</b> area is one reason for drivers reporting more discomfort from HID lamps. An implication is that the increased discomfort from HID lamps could be reduced by increasing their <b>illuminated</b> surface area...|$|R
5|$|Larkin was {{a notable}} critic of modernism in {{contemporary}} art and literature. His scepticism {{is at its}} most nuanced and <b>illuminating</b> in Required Writing, a collection of his book reviews and essays, and at its most inflamed and polemical {{in his introduction to}} his collected jazz reviews, All What Jazz, drawn from the 126 record-review columns he wrote for The Daily Telegraph between 1961 and 1971, which contains an attack on modern jazz that widens into a wholesale critique of modernism in the arts. Despite the reputation Larkin not unwillingly acquired as an enemy of modernism, recent critical assessments of Larkin's writings have identified them as possessing some modernist characteristics.|$|E

The 35th Infantry set to work to cover its front with trip flares, but they were in short supply and gradually it became impossible to replace them. <b>Illuminating</b> flares were also in short supply, and the reserve stocks had deteriorated to such a degree that only about 20 percent of the supply issued to the regiment was effective. Even when employed, the time lapse between a request for them and delivery by the big howitzers allowed some North Korean infiltration before the threatened area was illuminated.|$|E
