Most scholarship on archival-quality digitization has focused on either elements of digital library project management or on technical specifications and how to digitize materials.

25|$|The formalised {{system of}} chest {{compression}} {{was really an}} accidental discovery made in 1958 by William Bennett Kouwenhoven, Guy Knickerbocker, and James Jude at Johns Hopkins University. They were studying defibrillation in dogs when they noticed that by forcefully applying the paddles to the chest of the dog, they could achieve a pulse in the femoral artery. Further meticulous experimentation involving dogs answered such basic questions as how fast to press, where to press, and <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> to press. This information gave them the belief that they were ready for human trials.|$|E
25|$|Few {{data are}} {{available}} that show exactly <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> plesiosaurs dived. That they dived to some considerable depth is proven by traces of decompression sickness. The heads of the humeri and femora with many fossils show necrosis of the bone tissue, caused by a too rapid ascent after deep diving. However, this does not allow to deduce some exact depth as the damage could {{have been caused by}} a few very deep dives, or alternatively by a great number of relatively shallow descents. The vertebrae show no such damage: they were probably protected by a superior blood supply, made possible by the arteries entering the bone through the two foramina subcentralia, large openings in their undersides.|$|E

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine <b>how</b> <b>deeper</b> psychosocial {{structures}} can be examined utilising a contemporary provocative theory within workplace reflection to generate more radical insights and innovation. Design/methodology/approach This paper outlines a provocative theory and then presents case examples of <b>how</b> <b>deeper</b> structures can be examined at the micro, meso and macro levels. Findings Deeper psychosocial structures are the forces that keep the status quo firmly in place, but deeper examination of these structures enable radical insights and therefore the possibility of innovation. Research limitations/implications Deep psychosocial structures shape and constitute daily action, and so work based and practitioner researchers can be tricked into thinking they have identified new ways of working, but maybe demonstrating the same workplace behaviours/outcomes. Workplace behaviours, including emotional responses to apparent change, are key indicators of deeper structures. Practical implications Ideas and processes for examining deeper structures can be integrated into daily reflective practices by individuals, within organisational processes, and wider, system processes. However, because deeper structures can appear in different forms, we can be tricked into reproducing old structures. Social implications (if applicable) Examining deeper structures increases the possibilities for more radical insights into workplace structures, and therefore, how to potentially mobilise innovations which may better serve people and planet.

25|$|In the past, {{there was}} a gorilla that used a stick to measure <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> water was. In 2009, {{there was a}} western lowland gorilla at Buffalo zoo that used a bucket to collect water. Most notably, an {{experiment}} was conducted at Buffalo Zoological Gardens from 17 April 2010 to 26 June 2010 relating to this incident. The experiment involved one adult male gorilla and three adult female gorillas given five gallon buckets near a standing pool. Two of the younger female gorillas were able to successfully fill the buckets with water. This is the first record of gorillas spontaneously using tools to drink in zoos. What should be worth noting is that {{the environment of the}} zoo may affect the behavior of the gorillas.|$|E
25|$|In mid-November Call tried again. His forces made {{it across}} the Withlacoochee this time, but found the Cove abandoned. Call divided his forces, and {{proceeded}} up the river (south) on both sides. On November 17 Seminoles were routed from a large camp. There was another battle the next day, and the Seminoles were assumed to be headed for the Wahoo Swamp. Call waited to bring the other column across the river, then entered the Wahoo Swamp on November 21. The Seminoles resisted the advance in the Battle of Wahoo Swamp, as their families were close by, but had to retreat across a stream. Major David Moniac, a mix-blooded Creek {{who was the first}} Native American to graduate from West Point, tried to determine <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> the stream was, but was shot and killed by the Seminoles.|$|E
25|$|In appearance, {{the larvae}} are dark orange with small black spines {{protruding}} {{outward from the}} body. The larval stages of gulf fritillaries include five instars, each with a varying timeframe. After the eggs hatch, the new larvae eats the egg casings for food. Eventually, the larvae will transition either to consuming other eggs or parts of the host plant for nourishment. Throughout the first three instar stages, the larvae primarily consume the leaves and feed away from the leaf margins of the host plant. How much of the leaf and <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> into the layers the larva will eat depend on the type (i.e. thickness or thinness) of the leaf in question. Throughout the last two instar stages, the larvae mainly consume the leaves and feed at the leaf margins. Throughout this food acquisition process, {{the degree to which}} a specific leaf is eaten before it is abandoned in favor of another newer leaf largely depends on whether food is in plentiful or scarce supply. The average duration of the larval stage is between 11 and 16 days depending on the temperature of the environment.|$|E

40|$|The {{respiratory}} tree is {{a natural}} porous structure that is unique, challenging, and high-value media to study.

In this paper, particle deposition in a tree network made of glass fiber tubes that corresponds to the proximal-conducting zone of the respiratory tract [5, 6] is studied experimentally.

We show <b>how</b> <b>deeper</b> layers can be utilized to model the observed sequence using a sparser set of sinusoid units, and how non-uniform regularization can improve generalization by promoting the shifting of weight toward simpler units.

500|$|On 15 February 1990, in {{a speech}} {{delivered}} at the Sapienza University of Rome, Cardinal Ratzinger (later to become Pope Benedict XVI) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called [...] "a symptomatic case that permits us to see <b>how</b> <b>deep</b> the self-doubt of the modern age, {{of science and technology}} goes today". Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend, whom he quoted as saying [...] "The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself, and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo's teaching too. Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune."
