The haptics rendering transparency is all the more difficult in distributed collaboration between distant users because it is necessary also to make feel faithfully the mutual interactions.

40|$|With the {{development}} of Distributed Virtual Environment, <b>haptic</b> <b>simulation</b> is becoming a popular research field. However, time delay issue is always an obstacle in <b>haptic</b> <b>simulation</b> because this lag over the network-based haptic display violates the stability and performance of haptic display. In the research of teleoperations, some delay prediction methods have been introduced already; however, the performance requirements have been decreased to obtain the stability reducing the total loop gain. The design of virtual coupling, an artificial link between the haptic display and virtual environment, has been introduced into haptic interaction. However, in the traditional design, virtual coupling is always coupled with the virtual environment; as a result, stability condition for the <b>haptic</b> <b>simulation</b> becomes too tight because zero order hold has the phase lag over frequency. To guarantee the stability {{in the presence of}} unpredictable time delays new control design strategies are required. In this thesis, two-port network theory is introduced to design the virtual coupling to guarantee stability of haptic display in time-delayed Distributed Virtual Environments. By decoupling the hatpic display control problem from the design of virtual environments, the use of a virtual coupling network frees the developer of haptic-enabled virtual reality models from the issues of mechanical stability. Passivity criteria in two-port networks are introduced to guarantee stability of haptic interface with a unit time delay. Furthermore, two kinds of virtual environments models [...] "spring" and "spring-damping" have been simulated. Steady state error and transient response for the interaction between haptic displays and above virtual environments models are investigated.

Challenging issues of minimizing {{the difference between the}} cutting <b>simulation</b> and <b>haptic</b> contact <b>simulation</b> are analyzed. The proposed contact-based simulation method is developed for a one-dimensional cutting task and can be expanded to three-dimensional cases.

40|$|With {{advances}} in {{human computer interface}} technologies, the sense of touch has been successfully brought into many virtual reality applications. Haptic devices are such kinds of interfaces which can generate programmable forces to its users, allowing for natural manipulations of objects inside virtual environments. In this thesis, we study two critical issues with haptic interfaces that have a tool-like end effector. The first issue is about velocity and acceleration estimation for haptic interfaces. Since most haptic devices are equipped with neither tachometers nor accelerometers, this information has {{to be derived from}} discrete position measurements. However, due to a limited sensor resolution and a fast update rate requirement of <b>haptic</b> <b>simulations,</b> getting accurate and robust estimates is challenging. In studies of human arm/hand trajectories, researchers observed that skilled movements are usually extremely smooth that is equivalent to minimizing an objective measure with a performance index of jerk. With the assumption of a constrained minimum-jerk model for human arm/hand trajectories, an adaptive constrained 4 -state Kalman filter is proposed for the velocity and acceleration estimation for haptic devices. The second issue is about the influences of a haptic interface's effective mass and viscous damping on users' perceived virtual stiffness in 6 -DOF haptic rendering. In any <b>haptic</b> <b>simulations,</b> we always hope that the desired force can be delivered to the user faithfully. But the inherent dynamics of the device may have negative effects on the final perceived force. Through experiments, we have found that the induced forces from those physical parameters affect the perceived virtual stiffness non-uniformly: a surface that should feel uniformly stiff will feel softer or harder, depending on which part of the virtual tool it contacts. The scale of the non-uniform perception is also related to the user's holding point as well as its relative position to the contact points on the tool. Nevertheless, the goal of this study is not to increase the perceived hardness but to make users perceive a uniform hardness when tapping a virtual object. For that, we propose three different methods to compensate for the non-uniform hardness perception. The subjective evaluations show the effectiveness of all three methods...|$|R
