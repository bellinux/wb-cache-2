50|$|Khao Phanom Bencha {{is home to}} over 200 {{bird species}} and is a {{significant}} bird-spotting area. Species include white-crowned and helmeted hornbill, white-rumped shama and argus pheasant. An extremely rare bird here is the endangered <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta</b> is endangered. It was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} extinct for some time after 1952, but was rediscovered in 1986. Its rarity has been caused by the clearance of natural forest in southern Burma and peninsular Thailand.|$|R
50|$|The Dawna Range {{provides}} a habitat for the tiger, the wild Asian elephant and Fea's muntjak. Endangered {{species in the}} area are the plain-pouched hornbill and <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta.</b> There are other rare species some of which have only recently been discovered.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta</b> (Hydrornis gurneyi) is a {{medium-sized}} passerine bird. It breeds in the Malay Peninsula, with populations mainly in Myanmar. The common name and Latin binomial commemorate the British banker and amateur ornithologist John Henry Gurney (1819-1890). Its diet consists of slugs, insects, and earthworms.|$|R
50|$|The {{purposes}} of the reserve are habitat conservation, scientific research, and education. The typical habitat is tropical evergreen forest which covers 75% of its area; the remainder is mixed deciduous forest with bamboo clumps as well as grassland. The endangered <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta,</b> native to Thailand and Myanmar, {{is found in the}} reserve.|$|R
5000|$|APE {{is working}} in Khao Nor Chuchi [...] {{tropical}} lowland forest situated in Khoa Pra-Bang Khram National Reserve Forest and Khao Pra-Brag Khram Wildlife Sanctuary. Krabi Province has the last remaining areas of topical lowland forest in Thailand, these richly diverse areas are home to several endangered and threatened species such as bearcat, rufous-collared kingfisher and <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the {{national}} park is the maintenance of natural resources. The demarcation is in course. It is governed by the Burma Forest Department {{and the level of}} protection is partial, for logging and forest plantations are allowed. The altitudes within the park range from 10 to 855 m. The endangered <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta,</b> endemic to Thailand and Myanmar, is found within the park.|$|R
50|$|The Tenasserim Hills {{form the}} habitat {{for a number}} of {{endangered}} species, including the <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta,</b> endemic to Thailand and Burma, as well as the Asian elephant and tiger. The Sumatran rhinoceros has been reported in the northern section of the wider range. There are records from the north of Tenasserim proper, where there were numerous reports in 1962, to Kota Tinggi in the south where a rhino was captured in 1994 The Endau-Rompin National Park in Malaysia has the largest remaining Sumatran rhinoceros population in the range.|$|R
2500|$|Both parents {{incubate}} the clutch, {{the period}} between laying and hatching being between 14 and 18 days (14 to 16 being more typical). The chicks usually hatch asynchronously, {{over a number of}} days, but in some species the hatching is synchronous. On hatching the parents of at least two species are reported to consume the eggshells. The behaviour ensures that the calcium used to create the eggs is not lost. It is not known if other species do this, but it is a common behaviour in the bird world. As with the incubation period both parents participate in rearing the chicks. The chicks of pittas are entirely altricial, hatching both naked and blind, and dependent upon their parents for warmth, food and nest sanitation. Young chicks are brooded continuously, with the female brooding during the night and the duties being shared during the day. The males and females make regular feeding trips to the chicks; [...] one study of <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pittas</b> found a pair made 2300 feeding visits to the nest, traveling an estimated [...] over the nestling stage. Earthworms are important food items for many species, and the dominant item in the nestling diet of some. 73% of the parental visits of fairy pittas, 63% in rainbow pittas, up to 79% in <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pittas</b> are with earthworms. Parents can and do carry more than one item in their bills during visits; in a study of breeding fairy pittas as many as six items could be brought in a single visit, although less than four was typical. When the chicks are small prey may be broken up prior to being fed to the chicks, and larger prey items like skins and snakes are only fed to the older chicks able to manage them.|$|R
25|$|Pittas are {{generally}} forest birds {{and as such}} are vulnerable to habitat loss caused by rapid deforestation. They can also be difficult birds to survey and are easily overlooked. Four species are assessed to be endangered, and a further nine are listed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Additionally eight species are listed as near-threatened and one, the Louisiade pitta, is too poorly known to be assessed and is listed as data deficient. The <b>Gurney's</b> <b>pitta</b> was not seen for 34 years between 1952 and 1986, before a small population was discovered in southern Thailand. This small population continued to decline since its rediscovery, and by 2000 it had reached a low of 10 pairs, and was listed as critically endangered. In 2003 the species was found in Burma {{for the first time}} since 1914, and in large numbers, between nine and thirty five thousand pairs. Although the species was considerably less threatened than thought, it is still of considerable conservation concern as deforestation of the habitat in Burma continues. The rapid rate of deforestation in Borneo has pushed the blue-headed pitta, previously considered common and secure as recently as 1996, into the list of species considered vulnerable. Pittas have also been targeted by poachers for the illegal wild bird trade. They are not targeted because of their song, as many songbirds are, and may simply be captured as bycatch from collecting other species, and because of their attractive plumage. According to some trappers they also may end up being eaten for food. On Manus, locals report that predation by snakes, including the brown tree snake, is responsbile for the rarity of the endangered superb pitta, but the snake, which is responsible for a number of extinctions across the Pacific, is native to the island.|$|R
