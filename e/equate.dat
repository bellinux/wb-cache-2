[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The study investigates population invariance of <b>equating</b> functions in situations where <b>equating</b> samples are considerably unequal in size. Using an equivalent groups <b>equating</b> design, the study compares <b>equating</b> functions developed from the linear <b>equating</b> procedure, the unsmoothed equipercentile <b>equating</b> procedure, and the three-parameter IRT true-score <b>equating</b> procedure on examinee samples that were formed based on gender and ethnicity {{as well as on the}} total examinee sample. Multiple evaluative measures were used to evaluate <b>equating</b> differences. Findings indicate that <b>equating</b> invariance was reasonably achieved across the gender groups, that lack of <b>equating</b> invariance was found for the ethnic groups, and that the IRT true-score <b>equating</b> did not perform better in terms of robustness to form or group differences. The study findings suggest that sample sizes do influence <b>equating</b> invariance. With samples unequal in size, <b>equating</b> functions developed from the total examinee sample tend to be influences by the dominating examinee group, whereas <b>equating</b> functions obtained from small examinee samples are subject to larger sampling error. The study recommends linear <b>equating</b> for small <b>equating</b> samples based on examination of <b>equating</b> precision. Investigation of invariance of score classifications supports the use of linear <b>equating</b> with small <b>equating</b> samples becuase of better classification consistency. Higher consistency was found at passing scores that are farther away from the mean, suggesting that the location of cutoff scores impacts classification consistency. When <b>equating</b> samples are small, using cutoff scores may be a practical alternative to better <b>equating</b> invariance...|$|R
40|$|The kernel {{method of}} test <b>equating</b> is a unified {{approach}} to test <b>equating</b> with some advantages over traditional <b>equating</b> methods. Therefore, {{it is important}} to evaluate in a comprehensive way the usefulness and appropriateness of the Kernel <b>equating</b> (KE) method, as well as its advantages and disadvantages compared with several popular item response theory (IRT) <b>equating</b> techniques. The {{purpose of this study was}} to evaluate the accuracy and stability of KE and IRT true score <b>equating</b> by manipulating several common factors that are known to influence the <b>equating</b> results. ^ Three <b>equating</b> methods (Kernel post-stratification <b>equating,</b> Stocking-Lord and Mean/Sigma) were compared with an established <b>equating</b> criterion. A wide variety of conditions were simulated to match realistic situations that reflected differences in sample size, anchor test length and, group ability differences. The systematic error and random error of <b>equating</b> were summarized with bias statistics and the standard error of <b>equating</b> (SEE), and compared across the methods. The overall better <b>equating</b> methods under specific conditions were recommended based on the root mean squared error (RMSE). ^ The <b>equating</b> results revealed that, and as expected, in general, <b>equating</b> error decreased as the number of anchor items was increased and sample size was increased across all the methods. Aside from method effects, group differences in ability produced the greatest impact on <b>equating</b> error in this particular study. The accuracy and stability of each <b>equating</b> method depended on the portion of the score scale range where comparisons were being made. ^ Overall, Kernel <b>equating</b> was shown to be more stable in most situations but not as accurate as IRT <b>equating</b> for the conditions studied. The interactions between pairs of factors investigated in this study seemed to be more influential and beneficial to IRT <b>equating</b> than for KE.

Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} interaction of population invariance, <b>equating</b> assumptions, and <b>equating</b> accuracy with group differences. In addition, matched samples <b>equating</b> methods are considered as a possible way to improve <b>equating</b> accuracy with large group differences. Data from one administration of four mixed-format Advanced Placement (AP) Exams were used to create pseudo old and new forms sharing common items. Population invariance analyses were conducted based on levels of examinee parental education using a single group <b>equating</b> design. Old and new form groups with common item effect sizes (ESs) ranging from 0 to 0. 75 were created by sampling examinees based on their level of parental education. <b>Equating</b> was conducted for four common item nonequivalent group design <b>equating</b> methods: frequency estimation, chained equipercentile, IRT true score, and IRT observed score. Additionally, groups with ESs greater than zero were matched using three different matching techniques including exact matching on parental education level and propensity score matching with several other background variables. The accuracy of <b>equating</b> results was evaluated by comparing each <b>equating</b> relationship with an ES greater than zero to the <b>equating</b> relationship where the ES equaled zero. Differences between comparison and criterion <b>equating</b> relationships were quantified using the root expected mean squared difference (REMSD) statistic, classification consistency, and standard errors of <b>equating</b> (SEs). The accuracy of <b>equating</b> results and the adequacy of <b>equating</b> assumptions was compared for unmatched and matched samples. As ES increased, <b>equating</b> results tended to become less accurate and less consistent across <b>equating</b> methods. However, there was relatively little population dependence of <b>equating</b> results, despite large subgroup performance differences. Large differences between criterion and comparison <b>equating</b> relationships appeared to be caused instead by violations of <b>equating</b> assumptions. As group differences increased, {{the degree to which}} frequency estimation and chained equipercentile assumptions held decreased. In addition, all four AP Exams showed some evidence of multidimensionality.

5|$|It {{has also}} been {{suggested}} that Ölvir may be an ancestor of the MacLeods. Until quite recently, it was commonly believed by historians that the eponymous ancestor of the MacLeods, Leod, {{was the son of}} Olaf the Black, King of Mann and the Isles. In the late 20th century, William Matheson proposed that the MacLeods descended in the male line from Ölvir Rósta, rather than Olaf the Black. Matheson proposed that, within several Gaelic pedigrees which record ancestors of Leod, the great-grandfather of Leod has Gaelic names which very likely represent the Old Norse name Ölvir. These Gaelic names are considered to <b>equate</b> to other Gaelic names found within the early bardic poetry of the MacLeods. About a century before, Thomas had noted the similarity in these names, when discussing Ölvir, but he did not pursue a specific link between Ölvir and the MacLeods. Matheson speculated that Leod's great-grandfather would have flourished at roughly the same time as when Ölvir is said to have fled to the Suðreyjar. Matheson noted that Leod's name is derived from the Old Norse name Ljótr: a name which Matheson considered to be rare in Scandinavia and Iceland, and even more so in Scotland. In consequence, he considered it significant that Ölvir's maternal grandfather (Ljótr 'Villain') also had this name. When comparing the relevant Gaelic pedigrees, Matheson noted that they were inconsistent in the generations preceding Leod's great-grandfather. In lieu of this, Matheson proposed that these inconsistencies may show that the Leod's great-grandfather was a newcomer to the Hebrides, like Ölvir.|$|E
