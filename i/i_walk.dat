25|$|Douglas made seven films {{over the}} decades with Burt Lancaster: <b>I</b> <b>Walk</b> Alone (1948), Gunfight at the O.K. Corral (1957), The Devil's Disciple (1959), The List of Adrian Messenger (1963), Seven Days in May (1964), Victory at Entebbe (1976) and Tough Guys (1986), which fixed {{the notion of the}} pair as {{something}} of a team in the public imagination. Douglas was always second-billed under Lancaster in these movies but, with the exception of <b>I</b> <b>Walk</b> Alone, in which Douglas played a villain, their roles were {{more or less the same}} size. Both actors arrived in Hollywood at the same time, and first appeared together in the fourth film for each, albeit with Douglas in a supporting role. They both became actor-producers who sought out independent Hollywood careers.|$|E

25|$|In the 1980s, most favoured {{artists were}} punkish Dingo and heavy-hearted Yö, both singing their lyrics in Finnish. In the underground, Ismo Alanko, {{considered}} {{by many as the}} foremost Finnish rock lyricist, gained a legendary status with his punkish groups Hassisen Kone and Sielun Veljet. Kauko Röyhkä was another literate underground icon, leaning musically towards Velvet Underground. The 1980s showed short international fame for punk style glam rock band Hanoi Rocks. Hanoi Rocks have been cited as an influence by major bands such as Guns N' Roses. Smack and Peer Günt were other successful Finnish bands of same style. Heavy metal was very popular in Finland during the 1980s, producing groups like Stone, the latter being a fondly remembered speed metal act. Hardcore punk is also popular in Finland, including bands such as Endstand, Abduktio, <b>I</b> <b>Walk</b> the Line, and Lighthouse Project.|$|E

[...] As a federal judge, she is entitled to a pension equal to her full salary upon retirement.

The song is played in the time signature of common time in the key E minor, with Jackson's vocal range spanning from the tonal nodes of E4 to Bb5. [...] "You Rock My World" [...] has a moderate tempo of 95 [...] beats per minute. The chord progression in the song is Em7–C9-Bm7–Am7–D–Em7. The song's composition {{has been compared to}} Jackson's previous material with Quincy Jones from the 1970s and 1980s, as well as the disco-theme from Jackson's 1979 single, [...] "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough". Chris Tucker voices the vocal introduction of the song while all the instruments heard on the track were played by Jackson and Rodney Jerkins.

500|$|The cast {{included}} some notable real-world strippers such as Pandora Peaks. Rhames plays a bouncer named Shad. The filmmakers, in trying actors out for Shad's part, looked for someone [...] "at least 6'2 and physically massive...any ethnicity." [...] (Rhames is African American). Reynolds played Congressman Dilbeck, and he based his performance after politicians he knew {{in his early}} life, through his father, a police chief. Reynolds was not an actor that the filmmakers originally had in mind for the part, but Reynolds wanted it, contacted Castle Rock head Rob Reiner, and traveled to Miami to audition. [...] He accepted a salary lower than what he had made in his earlier career. Moore's own daughter Rumer Willis, who was 7 years old when the film was released, played Erin's daughter Angela. As Moore explained, [...] "she [...] wanted it so badly" [...] that Moore asked that Willis be considered for the part. In reality this required Willis to see Moore dancing topless, for {{a scene in which}} Angela sees Erin performing.

A couple of months later, writing in the same vein to Countess Maffei he stated: [...] "I'm not doing anything. I don't read.

[...] An 1858 letter by Strepponi to the publisher Léon Escudier describes the kind of lifestyle that increasingly appealed to the composer: [...] "His love for the country has become a mania, madness, rage, and fury—anything you like that is exaggerated. [...] He gets up almost with the dawn, to go and examine the wheat, the maize, the vines, etc....Fortunately our tastes for this sort of life coincide, except in the matter of sunrise, which he likes to see up and dressed, and I from my bed." ...|$|E

If {{you were able to}} look past the issues that plagued Fallout 3 and Oblivion before it, New Vegas will eventually show you a real good time." [...] 1UP.com's Mike Nelson wrote [...] "On one hand, it feels like I can recommend this to any fan of the Fallout series. I single these fans out because they're willing to forgive silly bugs like meeting characters who walk into walls or occasionally float in mid-air. These fans realize that the game as a whole is greater than the sum of minor graphical anomalies. [...] On the other hand, I simply can't ignore or forgive the game for crashing on me when <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> around the Mojave Wasteland; or for quests that simply can't be completed because of a game glitch; or for making my companions disappear when I need them the most during a battle.

We also wanted to be very clear that Peggy and Ana really like each other, and that there's no jealousy from Ana. Ana and Jarvis are so comfortable in their relationship, they're not going to be jealous of other people coming in and out of their lives." [...] On some of the differences between Ana and Edwin, Verbeek said, [...] "The first scene we had <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> in and I smack him on his ass, which is a sort of sexual, playful, fun thing they have.

Tolmach, {{now president of}} Columbia Pictures and Amy Pascal, co-chairman of Sony Pictures Entertainment, said they looked for a director who could give sharp focus to Parker's life. Webb said he [...] "was a little sceptical at first—you feel the presence of those other movies. But then I was like, 'How could <b>I</b> <b>walk</b> away from this? What an opportunity!'" [...] Webb said in the press release announcing him that, [...] "Sam Raimi's virtuoso rendering of Spider-Man is a humbling precedent to follow and build upon. The first three films are beloved for good reason. But I think the Spider-Man mythology transcends not only generations but directors as well. I am signing on not to 'take over' from Sam. That would be impossible. Not to mention arrogant. I'm here because there's an opportunity for ideas, stories, and histories that will add a new dimension, canvas, and creative voice to Spider-Man." [...] Webb felt Spider-Man {{is different from the}} Harry Potter franchise, which is based on a few novels and [...] "more like James Bond" [...] because [...] "there's so much material in Spider-Man {{that there are so many}} stories to tell and so many characters."
