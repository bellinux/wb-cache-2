50|$|In May 2010, Sikorsky {{announced}} an engine upgrade for the CH-148 Cyclone {{by the end}} of 2012. General Electric is developing a new engine version based on the CT7-8A1. The CT7-8A1 makes the CH-148 Cyclone heavier and less efficient than expected. General Electric is currently developing the CT7-8A7 to be certified by June 2012 and eventually integrated into the Cyclone as soon as possible. General Electric will develop the upgraded engine at its own expense. The new CT7-8A7 engine version will produce 10% additional horsepower. The CT7-8A7 will include modifications to the <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold</b> and nozzles. The interim CH-148s will be provided with CT7-8A1 engines.|$|E
50|$|The {{thrust chamber}} {{injector}} received the propellants {{under pressure from}} the turbopumps, then mixed them in a manner that produced the most efficient combustion. 614 hollow oxidizer posts were machined to form {{an integral part of the}} injector, with fuel nozzles (each swaged to the face of the injector) threaded through and installed over the oxidizer posts in concentric rings. The injector face was porous, being formed from layers of stainless steel wire mesh, and was welded at its periphery to the injector body. The injector received LOX through the dome manifold and injected it through the oxidizer posts into the combustion area of the thrust chamber, while fuel was received from the upper <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold</b> in the thrust chamber and injected through the fuel orifices which were concentric with the oxidizer orifices. The propellants were injected uniformly to ensure satisfactory combustion. The injector and oxidizer dome assembly was located at the top of the thrust chamber. The dome provided a manifold for the distribution of the LOX to the injector and served as a mount for the gimbal bearing and the augmented spark igniter.|$|E

With the burner configuration used in this investigation, having a mixing length of only 8 inches between the <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold</b> and the flame holder, the low-vapor-pressure fuel gave lower combustion efficiency at a given tail-pipe fuel-air ratio. Because the exhaust-nozzle area was fixed, the lower efficiency resulted in lower thrust and higher specific fuel consumption.

40|$|A low NO(x) {{emissions}} combustor {{has been}} demonstrated in flame-tube tests. A multipoint, lean-direct injection concept was used. Configurations were tested that had 25 - and 36 - fuel injectors {{in the size of}} a conventional single fuel injector. An integrated-module approach was used for the construction where chemically etched laminates, diffusion bonded together, combine the fuel injectors, air swirlers and <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold</b> into a single element. Test conditions were inlet temperatures up to 810 K, inlet pressures up to 2760 kPa, and flame temperatures up to 2100 K. A correlation was developed relating the NO(x) emissions with the inlet temperature, inlet pressure, fuel-air ratio and pressure drop. Assuming that 10 percent of the combustion air would be used for liner cooling and using a hypothetical engine cycle, the NO(x) emissions using the correlation from flame-tube tests were estimated to be less than 20 percent of the 1996 ICAO standard...|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} 2 D transient {{analysis for}} a predicted trajectory in a representative scramjet flight path is presented. This model incorporates hypersonic convection and radiation heat transfer at the combustor walls and heat {{transfer to the}} fuel which is used as an endothermic heat sink. A heavy hydrocarbon fuel is selected due to the high density and energy release required for combustion, whilst still providing the necessary heat sink for cooling. In this process the fuel can be cracked to smaller carbon chained molecules for improved ignition and combustion. This analysis {{will be used in}} parallel with materials development to ensure appropriate composites are available in Australia for flight structures.

40|$|The {{blending}} {{technique used}} in internal combustion engines can reduce emission of toxic exhaust components and noises, enhance overall {{energy efficiency and}} reduce fuel costs. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the effects of dual alcohols (methanol and ethanol) blended in gasoline fuel (GF) against performance, combustion and emission characteristics. Problems arise in the fuel delivery system when using the highly volatile methanol - gasoline blends. This problem is reduced by using special <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold.</b> However, the satisfactory engine performance of the dual alcohol–gasoline blends need to be proved. The test fuels were GF, blend M 35 g 65 (35 % methanol, and 65 % GF by volume), blend E 40 g 60 (40 % ethanol, and 6 o% GF by volume). The blend M 35 g 65 was selected to match the vapor pressure (VP) of GF. The test fuels were a lean mixture with excess-air ratio of λ= 1. 1. The reaction parameters are taken from literatures and fitting calculations. Mathematical model and Computer software AVL program were conducted on a naturally-aspirated, spark ignition engine. The results show that indicate thermal efficiency (ITE) improved whereas the exhaust gas temperature (EGT) of the blends reduced, which is a benefit that reduces compression work. The regulated emissions were also reported. The blend E 40 g 60 was recommended in preference to use because the former had shortened combustion duration, high energy content and its VP was selectively matched to that of GF's...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a 24 C- 4 combustor was investigated with three different combustor baskets and five modifications of these baskets at conditions simulating static (zero-ram) operation of the 24 C jet engine over ranges of altitude and engine speed to determine and improve the altitude operational limits of the 24 C combustor. Information was also obtained regarding combustion characteristics, the fuel-flow characteristics of the <b>fuel</b> <b>manifolds,</b> and the combustor total-pressure drop. NACA modifications, which consisted of blocking rows of holes on the baskets, increased the minimum point on the altitude-operational-limit curve, which occurs at low engine speeds, for a narrow-upstream-end basket by 8000 feet (from 23, 000 to 31, 000 ft_ and for a wide-upstream-end basket by 21, 000 feet (from 12, 000 to 34, 000 ft).

40|$|The {{development}} of the RS- 84 engine began in 2002 {{as part of the}} Space Launch Initiative. It was intended to be a reusable liquid oxygen/RP- 1 booster engine of approximately 1 Mlbf thrust. Part of the test campaign consisted of testing subscale components to study key technologies such as oxygenrich, liquid oxygen/RP- 1 combustion. In late 2003, the subscale preburner completed 4 hot-fire tests at Stennis Space Center with various hardware configurations and operating conditions, but before all planned tests could be completed the RS- 84 engine development program was canceled in 2004. Recently, there has been a renewed interest in the {{development of}} an oxygen-rich, liquid oxygen/RP- 1 combustion engine. Aerojet Rocketdyne and NASA completed testing of the subscale preburner in 2014 at Marshall Space Flight Center in an effort to better understand the chug encountered during the 2003 testing and to collect performance information over a wider range of operating conditions. The 2003 and 2014 data sets included extreme chug oscillations that reached nearly 200 % of the chamber pressure and were reduced to well below 10 % of the chamber pressure by incorporating a fuel orifice upstream of the <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold.</b> Depending on the hardware configuration and operating condition, a wide range of chug oscillation amplitudes were encountered.

40|$|The J- 2 X engine {{being pursued}} for the Ares I {{will be a}} {{derivative}} of the J- 2 engine developed by Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR). As part of the engine development, a subscale injector was fabricated by PWR and hot-fire tested at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to evaluate performance data. This subscale injector had a reduced injector diameter and fewer elements than the full scale design, but the element density (#elements / injector area), and element geometries nearly identical to the full scale design. Three different materials {{were used for the}} LOX posts in order to test for durability. The subscale injector included 46 standard elements and 6 baffle elements, corresponding to the ratio of baffled elements to core elements in the full scale design. The baffle elements were included to demonstrate thermal compatibility of the baffles and to more closely represent the full scale performance. Fifteen hot-fire tests were conducted totaling over 200 seconds of mainstage time on the injector. Chamber pressures with oxygen/hydrogen propellants ranged from 870 - 1380 psig with mixture ratios ranging from 4. 8 - 6. 1. <b>Fuel</b> <b>manifold</b> inlet temperatures were varied from 190 to 300 R. Modular, water cooled, calorimeter chamber assemblies were used to provide heating rate data and evaluate the effects of characteristic length (L*). Performance was evaluated relative to the resulting characteristic velocity (C*) efficiency. Performance met the value required in order to proceed with this design for the full scale hardware. Hardware inspections show no evidence of cracking {{at the tip of the}} LOX post for any of the materials tested. Minor erosion of the baffle element tips was observed in the early testing.

40|$|Gaseous methane and 90 % {{hydrogen}} peroxide at an equivalence ratio of 0. 8 {{were used to}} study combustion instabilities in the region where the system transitioned from stable to unstable combustion. A variable geometry unstable rocket combustor was used at a chamber pressure of 210 psi. The combustor consists of a coaxial shear injector and a simple dump plane combustor. The oxidizer injector is mounted on a translating shaft that allows the oxidizer post length to be changed from a ½ wave resonator to a ¼ wave resonator {{during the course of}} a test. The oxidizer injector was translated forward and backward to check for hysteresis effects. A series of tests with the oxidizer injector fixed at a given location were also performed. The results indicate that the translating post moves slow enough compared to the frequency of the pressure oscillations that the system can be considered “quasi-steady. ” High frequency pressure data from the oxidizer and <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold,</b> oxidizer post, and various chamber locations were obtained at a scan rate of at least 100 kHz. The physics of the combustion process were examined to determine whether or not they remained constant as the system transitioned from marginally stable to highly unstable combustion. The primary frequency of combustion, pressure mode shape, and phase angle between pressure at the head end of the chamber and pressure at the aft end of the chamber were found to change as the system transitioned to unstable combustion. The first five inches of the combustion chamber were replaceable with a quartz/acrylic housing. This allowed the combustion at the head end of the combustor to be filmed with a high speed camera. Line of sight optical images were obtained at scan rate of 10 kHz. Light intensity was used as an estimation of local unsteady heat release. The phase angles and Rayleigh index between the unsteady light and unsteady pressure oscillations were calculated and driving and damping regions identified. ...|$|E
40|$|A Westinghouse 24 C- 2 {{combustor}} {{was investigated}} at conditions simulating {{operation of the}} 24 C Jet engine at zero ram over ranges of altitude and engine speed. The investigation was conducted to determine the altitude operational limits, that is, the maximum altitude for various engine speeds at which an average combustor-outlet gas temperature sufficient for operation of the jet engine could be obtained. Information was also obtained regarding {{the character of the}} flames, the combustion efficiency, the combustor-outlet gas temperature and velocity distributions, the extent of afterburning, the flow characteristics of the <b>fuel</b> <b>manifolds,</b> the combustor inlet-to-outlet total-pressure drop, and the durability of the combustor basket. The results of the investigation indicated that the altitude operational limits for zero ram decreased from 12, 000 feet at an engine speed of 4000 rpm to a minimum of 9000 feet at 6000 rpm, and thence increased to 49, 000 feet at 12, 000 rpm [...] At altitudes below the operational limits, flames were essentially steady, but, at altitudes above the operational limits, flames were often cycling and either blew out or caused violent explosions and vibrations. At conditions on the altitude operational limits the type of combustion varied from steady to cycling with increasing fuel-air ratio and the reverse occurred with decreasing fuel-air ratio. In the region of operation investigated, the combustion efficiency ranged from 75 to 95 percent at altitudes below the operational limits and dropped to 55 percent or less at some altitudes above the operational limits. The deviations in the local combustor-outlet gas temperatures were within + 20 to - 30 percent of the mean combustor temperature rise for inlet-air temperatures {{at the low end of}} the range investigated, but became more uneven (up to +/- 100 percent) with increasing inlet-air temperatures. The distribution of the combustor-outlet gas velocity followed a similar trend. Practically no afterburning downstream of the combustor outlet occurred. At conditions of high inlet-air temperature several factors indicated that fuel vapor or air formed in the <b>fuel</b> <b>manifolds</b> and adversely affected combustion. The combustor inlet-to-outlet total-pressure drop can be correlated as a function of the ratio of the combustion-air inlet density to outlet density and of the inlet dynamic pressure.

40|$|In June 2010, an 870 lbf Space Shuttle Orbiter Reaction Control System Primary Thruster {{experienced}} an unintended shutdown during a test being {{performed at the}} NASA White Sands Test Facility. Subsequent removal and inspection of the thruster revealed permanent deformation and misalignment of the thruster valve mounting plate. Destructive evaluation determined that after three nominal firing sequences, the thruster had {{experienced an}} energetic event within the fuel (monomethylhydrazine) manifold {{at the start of}} the fourth firing sequence. The current understanding of the phenomenon of intra-manifold explosions in hypergolic bipropellant thrusters is documented in literature where it is colloquially referred to as a ZOT. The typical ZOT scenario involves operation of a thruster in a gravitational field with environmental pressures above the triple point pressure of the propellants. Post-firing, when the thruster valves are commanded closed, there remains a residual quantity of propellant in both the fuel and oxidizer (nitrogen tetroxide) injector manifolds known as the "dribble volume". In an ambient ground test configuration, these propellant volumes will drain from the injector manifolds but are impeded by the local atmospheric pressure. The evacuation of propellants from the thruster injector manifolds relies on the fluids vapor pressure to expel the liquid. The higher vapor pressure oxidizer will evacuate from the manifold before the lower vapor pressure fuel. The localized cooling resulting from the oxidizer boiling during manifold draining can result in fuel vapor migration and condensation in the oxidizer passage. The liquid fuel will then react with the oxidizer that enters the manifold during the next firing and may produce a localized high pressure reaction or explosion within the confines of the oxidizer injector manifold. The typical ZOT scenario was considered during this failure investigation, but was ultimately ruled out as a cause of the explosion. Converse to the typical ZOT failure mechanism, the failure of this particular thruster was determined to be the result of liquid oxidizer being present within the <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold...</b>|$|E
40|$|Various {{aspects of}} the pressure-gain {{combustion}} engine are investigated analytically and experimentally in the current study. A lumped parameter model is developed to characterize the operation of a valveless pulse detonation engine. The model identified the function of flame quenching process through gas dynamic process. By adjusting <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold</b> pressure and geometries, {{the duration of the}} air buffer can be effectively varied. The parametric study with the lumped parameter model has shown that engine frequency of up to approximately 15 Hz is attainable. However, requirements for upstream air pressure increases significantly with higher engine frequency. The higher pressure requirement indicates pressure loss in the system and lower overall engine performance. ^ The loss of performance due to the pressure loss is a critical issue for the integrated pressure-gain combustors. Two types of transitional methods are examined using entropy-based models. An accumulator based transition has obvious loss due to sudden area expansion, but it can be minimized by utilizing the gas dynamics in the combustion tube. An ejector type transition has potential to achieve performance beyond the limit specified by a single flow path Humphrey cycle. The performance of an ejector was discussed in terms of apparent entropy and mixed flow entropy. Through an ideal ejector, the apparent part of entropy increases due to the reduction in flow unsteadiness, but entropy of the mixed flow remains constant. The method is applied to a CFD simulation with a simple manifold for qualitative evaluation. ^ The operation of the wave rotor constant volume combustion rig is experimentally examined. The rig has shown versatility of operation for wide range of conditions. Large pressure rise in the rotor channel and in a section of the exhaust duct are observed even with relatively large leakage gaps on the rotor. The simplified analysis indicated that inconsistent combustion is likely due to insufficient fuel near the ignition source. However, it is difficult to conclude its fuel distribution with the current setup. Additional measurement near the rotor interfaces and better fuel control are required for the future test. ...|$|E

In support {{of the development of}} these engines, hot-fire testing on subscale coaxial injectors has been performed at NASA s Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) to evaluate performance data relative to injector type, liquid oxygen (LOX) post tip design features, element density and various operating conditions. Shear coaxial injectors with element densities of 1. 1, 1. 6, and 2. 3 elements/in 2 and a swirl coaxial injector with element density of 1. 6 elements/in 2 were evaluated at conditions relevant to the Ares applications. Chamber pressures with oxygen/hydrogen propellants ranged from 815 - 1630 psig with mixture ratios ranging from 4. 7 - 6. 9. <b>Fuel</b> <b>manifold</b> inlet temperatures were varied from 90 to 270 R. Shear coaxial LOX post tip thicknesses ranged from 0. 006 in. to 0. 0175 in. Modular, water cooled, calorimeter chamber assemblies were used to provide heating rate data and evaluate the effects of characteristic length (L*). Performance was evaluated relative to the resulting characteristic velocity (C*) efficiency. Testing with both the 2. 3 and 1. 1 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injectors demonstrated no improvement in performance of the "thin" tip configuration versus the "thick" tip configuration. The loss in chamber pressure and associated performance loss seen in previous testing at low fuel temperatures could not be reliably repeated, indicating that this loss is not the result of a fluidic process in the injector elements. Further, no performance loss could be demonstrated once a faceplate seal specifically designed for operation with low temperature hydrogen was implemented in the 1. 1 elements/sq in shear coaxial injector. Results for the 1. 6 elements/sq in swirl injector at cold fuel temperatures showed performance higher than both the 1. 6 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injector and the 2. 3 elements/in 2 shear coaxial injector...|$|E

40|$|The low-emissions {{combustor}} development described {{is directed}} toward advanced high pressure aircraft gas-turbine applications. The emphasis {{of this research is}} to reduce nitrogen oxides (NOx) at high-power conditions and to maintain carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons at their current low levels at low power conditions. Low-NOx combustors can be classified into rich-burn and lean-burn concepts. Lean-burn combustors can be further classified into lean-premixed-prevaporized (LPP) and lean direct injection (LDI) concepts. In both concepts, all the combustor air, except for liner cooling flow, enters through the combustor dome so that the combustion occurs at the lowest possible flame temperature. The LPP concept has been shown to have the lowest NOx emissions, but for advanced high-pressure-ratio engines, the possibility of autoignition or flashback precludes its use. LDI differs from LPP in that the fuel is injected directly into the flame zone, and thus, it does not have the potential for autoignition or flashback and should have greater stability. However, since it is not premixed and prevaporized, good atomization is necessary and the fuel must be mixed quickly and uniformly so that flame temperatures are low and NOx formation levels are comparable to those of LPP. The LDI concept described is a multipoint fuel injection/multiburning zone concept. Each of the multiple fuel injectors has an air swirler associated with it to provide quick mixing and a small recirculation zone for burning. The multipoint fuel injection provides quick, uniform mixing and the small multiburning zones provide for reduced burning residence time, resulting in low NOx formation. An integrated-module approach was used for the construction where chemically etched laminates, diffusion bonded together, combine the fuel injectors, air swirlers, and <b>fuel</b> <b>manifold</b> into a single element. The multipoint concept combustor was demonstrated in a 15 sector test. The configuration tested had 36 fuel injectors and fuel-air mixers that replaced two fuel injectors in a conventional dual-annular combustor. During tests, inlet temperatures were up to 870 K and inlet pressures were up to 5400 kPa. A correlation was developed that related the NOx emissions with the inlet temperature, inlet pressure, fuel-air ratio, and pressure drop. At low-power conditions, fuel staging was used so that high combustion efficiency was obtained with only one-fourth of the fuel injectors flowing.

40|$|Liquid jets in subsonic crossflows find varied {{applications}} in propulsion systems which include gas turbine combustors, aircraft afterburners and liquid fuelled ramjets. In {{the wake of}} environmental concerns and rising fuel costs, there is {{a renewed interest in}} the detailed study of sprays and its characterization as applicable to propulsion systems. An optimal fuel concentration is desirable for propulsion systems to achieve stable ignition, high efficiency and lower emissions. In a gas turbine afterburner, fuel is injected transversely into the air stream through a plain orifice injector from <b>fuel</b> <b>manifolds,</b> distributed across the combustor cross section. In a conventional ramjet, air is captured and decelerated to a subsonic velocity by an inlet diffuser, before fuel is added to the air stream.

Although there have been many studies on the break-up and penetration of jets in subsonic crossflows, the literature pertaining to conditions relevant to ramjets and afterburners which is characterized by significant cross stream velocities (Mach 0. 25 - 0. 5) is very scarce. Among the investigations reported almost all of them have concentrated on the macroscale penetration aspects and detailed information about the spray characteristics such as drop size distribution in the near and far field is lacking. In this work the structure of spray plumes from water jets injected into high subsonic crossflows of Mach numbers between 0. 3 - 0. 6 were experimentally investigated using high speed imaging and laser diffraction techniques to measure the penetration and drop size distribution...|$|R
5000|$|The LG5 ("V-code") was {{a special}} 3.1 L {{turbocharged}} engine produced with McLaren for just two years, 1989 and 1990. It featured the same multi-port <b>fuel</b> injection intake <b>manifolds</b> and throttle body as the LH0, but cranked out [...] at 5200 rpm and 225 lbft Nm of torque at 2100 rpm.Approximately 3,700 engines were produced each year. This engine had a block with more nickel content and hardened internals.|$|R
50|$|Beginning the {{turbopump}} operation, hot gas {{entered the}} nozzles and, in turn, {{the first stage}} turbine wheel. After passing through the first stage turbine wheel, the gas was redirected by the stator blades and entered the second stage turbine wheel. The gas then left the turbine through exhaust ducting, passed through the heat exchanger, and exhausted into the thrust chamber through a manifold directly above the <b>fuel</b> inlet <b>manifold.</b> Power from the turbine was transmitted {{by means of a}} one-piece shaft to the pump. The velocity of the LOX was increased through the inducer and impeller. As the LOX entered the outlet volute, velocity was converted to pressure and the LOX was discharged into the outlet duct at high pressure.|$|R
5000|$|This {{system was}} made up of an {{integral}} helium and hydrogen start tank, which contained the hydrogen and helium gases for starting and operating the engine. The gaseous hydrogen imparted initial spin to the turbines and pumps prior to gas generator combustion, and the helium was used in the control system to sequence the engine valves. The spherical helium tank was positioned inside the hydrogen tank to minimize engine complexity. It held [...] of helium. The larger spherical hydrogen gas tank had a capacity of [...] Both tanks were filled from a ground source prior to launch and the gaseous hydrogen tank was refilled during engine operation from the thrust chamber <b>fuel</b> inlet <b>manifold</b> for subsequent restart in third stage application.|$|R
5000|$|Power for the [...] "CERV-I" [...] is {{supplied}} by a specially-developed, lightweight {{version of the}} Chevrolet 283 cubic inch. V-8 that develops [...] and weighs only 350 pounds (159 kg). Such specific output, only one pound per horsepower, is rarely achieved in reciprocating engines, {{even in the most}} highly developed aircraft types. The dramatic reduction of weight was gained by using aluminum for the cylinder block, cylinder heads, water pump, starter motor body, flywheel, and clutch pressure plate. In the cylinder block, no bore liners are used and the pistons run directly on specially treated aluminum bores. Magnesium is used for the clutch housing, <b>fuel</b> injection <b>manifold,</b> and manifold adapter plate. Weight savings achieved through the use of lighter metals in the engine and clutch is in excess of 175 pounds (79 kg).|$|R
