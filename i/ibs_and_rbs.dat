Semen from Angus (A), Gray Brahman (GB), Gir (G), Indu-Brazil (<b>IB),</b> Nellore (N) <b>and</b> Red Brahman (<b>RB)</b> bulls was used to artificially inseminate Hereford cows for four years. The F, heifer offspring of these matings were bred to calve annually from 1985 through 1996. Teat length and teat diameter were estimated on each quarter of each cow, and a subjective udder support score was assigned to each cow postpartum. Calving records (n = 1016) were evaluated for teat length and diameter average (TLA and TDA, respectively), front teat length and diameter average (FTLA and FTDA, respectively), rear teat length and diameter average (RTLA and RTDA), left front teat length and diameter (LFTL and LFTD), right front teat length and diameter (RFTL and RFTD), left rear teat length and diameter (LRTL and LRTD) and right rear teat length and diameter (RRTL and RRTD) and udder support score (US). These characters were also evaluated with all parity 12 records excluded (n = 1006) and with all parity 10, I I and 12 records excluded (n = 929). IB cross cows had the longest teat lengths and largest teat diameters (P <. 05) in most analyses; N cross cows had the shortest teat lengths and smallest teat diameters. N-sired cows had the tightest udders as indicated by the highest udder support scores; IB sired cows had the most pendulous and(or) broken down udders as indicated by the lowest udder support scores. Grouping of <b>RB</b> <b>and</b> GB did not change these results. Grouping of GB, G, <b>IB,</b> N <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> resulted in no significant difference between this group and A cross cows for any character analyzed. A sire breed by parity of cow interaction (P <. 05) was found for all characters analyzed except RTDA, RRTD, and LRTD. Descriptively, after attempting to remove the selection effect of culling by eliminating all cows that did not have at least nine records (n = 813), TLA increased from parity one through parity seven and then decreased through parity I 1. TDA increased from parity one through parity 10, followed by a slight decrease for parity I 1. US tended to decrease from parity one through parity I 1. Estimated heritabilities ranged from. 65 to. 83 for teat length traits, from. 01 to. 32 for teat diameter traits. Estimated repeatabilities ranged from. 51 to. 57 for teat length traits, and from. 42 to. 54 for teat diameter traits.

40|$|Abstract Background We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that Chlamydophila pneumoniae contains a dual-specific Ser/Thr protein kinase that phosphorylates CdsD, a structural {{component of the}} type III secretion apparatus. To further study the role of PknD in growth and development we sought to identify a PknD inhibitor to determine whether PknD activity is required for replication. Results Using an in vitro kinase assay we screened 80 known eukaryotic protein kinase inhibitors for activity against PknD and identified a 3 '-pyridyl oxindole compound that inhibited PknD autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of CdsD. The PknD inhibitor significantly retarded {{the growth rate of}} C. pneumoniae as evidenced by the presence of very small inclusions with a reduced number of bacteria as seen by electron microscopy. These inclusions contained the normal replicative forms including elementary bodies (EB), intermediate bodies (<b>IB)</b> <b>and</b> reticulate bodies (<b>RB),</b> but lacked persistent bodies (PB), indicating that induction of persistence was not the cause of reduced chlamydial growth. Blind passage of C. pneumoniae grown in the presence of this PknD inhibitor for 72 or 84 hr failed to produce inclusions, suggesting this compound blocks an essential step in the production of infectious chlamydial EB. The compound was not toxic to HeLa cells, did not block activation of the MEK/ERK pathway required for chlamydial invasion and did not block intracellular replication of either Chlamydia trachomatis serovar D or Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium suggesting that the inhibitory effect of the compound is specific for C. pneumoniae. Conclusion We have identified a 3 '-pyridyl oxindole compound that inhibits the in vitro kinase activity of C. pneumoniae PknD and inhibits the growth and production of infectious C. pneumoniae progeny in HeLa cells. Together, these results suggest that PknD may {{play a key role in}} the developmental cycle of C. pneumoniae. </p...|$|R

This experiment {{was conducted to}} investigate gene expression differences, transcriptional regulation and genetic polymorphisms that could {{be associated with the}} observed phenotypic differences between <b>IB</b> <b>and</b> IBxDU pigs. Nine <b>IB</b> <b>and</b> 10 IBxDU pigs were slaughtered at birth. Morphometric measures and blood samples were obtained and samples from Biceps femoris muscle were employed for compositional and transcriptome analysis by RNA-Seq technology. Phenotypic differences were evident at this early age, including greater body size and weight in IBxDU and greater Biceps femoris intramuscular fat and plasma cholesterol content in IB newborns. We detected 149 differentially expressed genes between <b>IB</b> <b>and</b> IBxDU neonates (p 1. 5). Several were related to adipose and muscle tissues development (DLK 1, FGF 21 or UBC). The functional interpretation of the transcriptomic differences revealed enrichment of functions and pathways related to lipid metabolism in <b>IB</b> <b>and</b> to cellular and muscle growth in IBxDU pigs. Protein catabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis and immune system were functions enriched in both genotypes. We identified transcription factors potentially affecting the observed gene expression differences. Some of them have known functions on adipogenesis (CEBPA, EGRs), lipid metabolism (PPARGC 1 B) and myogenesis (FOXOs, MEF 2 D, MYOD 1), which suggest {{a key role in the}} meat quality differences existing between <b>IB</b> <b>and</b> IBxDU hams. We also identified several polymorphisms showing differential segregation between <b>IB</b> <b>and</b> IBxDU pigs. Among them, non-synonymous variants were detected in several transcription factors as PPARGC 1 B and TRIM 63 genes, which could be associated to altered gene function. Taken together, these results provide information about candidate genes, metabolic pathways and genetic polymorphisms potentially involved in phenotypic differences between <b>IB</b> <b>and</b> IBxDU pigs associated to meat quality and production traits...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} light qualities on growth, photosynthesis, leaf anatomy and isoprenoid emission was studied {{in two different}} fast-growing plant systems: a herbaceous crop, tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and a tree, oriental plane (Platanus orientalis L.). Both plant species were subjected to three different light quality regimes: RGB (Red 33 %, Green 33 %, Blue 33 %) <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> (Red 66 %, Blue 33 %), provided by light emitting diodes (LED); and white light (WL), considered as a control and provided by white fluorescent lamps. Compared to WL, RGB <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> reduced plant height, plant biomass and leaf area. The CO 2 assimilation rate (A) was lower in tomato grown under WL than RGB <b>and</b> <b>RB,</b> while A was similar in oriental plane leaves exposed to the three light regimes. In tomato, stomatal (gs) and mesophyll (gm) conductance were higher under RGB <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> compared to WL. In plane, gs was also higher under RGB <b>and</b> <b>RB,</b> while gm was not significantly influenced by different light qualities. In both species, leaf lamina thickness (LT) and stomata size were the anatomical traits most affected by the different light regimes. In tomato, LT was significantly reduced in RGB <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> leaves, whereas in oriental plane LT was significantly higher in RGB <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> than in WL leaves. In both species, RB leaves showed higher stomata size than WL and RGB leaves. Light quality also affected photosynthesis-dependent volatile isoprenoids. In tomato, β-phellandrene was lower under <b>RB</b> <b>and</b> RGB compared to WL. However, RGB <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> stimulated α-pinene, carene and α-terpinene emissions. Oriental plane released about 14 nmol m- 2 s- 1 isoprene when growing at WL, while the emission was reduced under RGB and even more under RB. In summary, photosynthetic performance, leaf anatomy, biomass production, and volatile isoprenoids are affected by light quality differently in tomato and plane plants. Light quality control may have important applications to modulate plant productivity and increase biosynthesis of useful biochemical compounds...|$|R
40|$|Aggressive Behavior (AGG) <b>and</b> Rule-Breaking Behavior (<b>RB)</b> {{are two of}} {{the eight}} CBCL syndromes. The {{phenotypic}} correlation between AGG <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> ranges from. 48 to. 76, and varies depending on the rater and the sex of the child. Prevalence of AGG <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> (i. e., T ≥ 67) is in the range of 6 %- 7 % in both boys and girls. Fifty percent to 60 % of the children who are deviant on AGG are also deviant on <b>RB</b> <b>and</b> vice versa. Why so many children show problem behavior in the clinical range for both syndromes is unclear. This co- occurrence could be due to genetic factors influencing both traits, to environmental factors influencing both traits, or to both. The {{purpose of this study is}} to use a genetically informative sample to estimate genetic and environmental influences on AGG <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> <b>and</b> to investigate the etiology of the co-occurrence of both behaviors. We do this using multiple informants to take into account underlying sources of parental agreement and disagreement in ratings of their offspring. To this end, mother and father ratings of AGG <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> were collected by using the Child Behavior Checklist in a large sample of 12 -year-old twins. Parental agreement is represented by an interparent correlation in the range of. 53 -. 76, depending on phenotype (AGG or <b>RB)</b> <b>and</b> sex of the child. Genetic influences account for 79 % and 69 % of the individual differences in <b>RB</b> <b>and</b> AGG behavior (defined as AGG <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> on which both parents do agree) in boys. In girls 56 % and 72 % of the variance in <b>RB</b> <b>and</b> AGG are accounted for by genetic factors. Shared environmental influences are significant for RB in girls only, explaining 23 % of the total variance. Eighty percent of the covariance between AGG <b>and</b> <b>RB,</b> similarly assessed by both parents, can be explained by genetic influences. So, co-occurrence in AGG <b>and</b> <b>RB</b> is mainly caused by a common set of genes. Parental disagreement seems to be a combination of so-called rater bias and of parental specific views...|$|R
