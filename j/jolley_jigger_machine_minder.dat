30|$|Two {{machines}} {{were used to}} make the flower pot [11]. They were mixing machine, in which there were two screw parts to mix homogeneously, and shape forming (<b>jigger)</b> <b>machine.</b> The material mixed by the paddle was poured into the mixing machine. The thoroughly mixed material by the mixing machine (clay slurry) was put into the circular plaster mold as a fixed mold. This plaster mold looked like hollow cone (12.0  cm height, inner diameter 15.6  cm at top and 9.6  cm at bottom). The clay slurry was poured into the plaster mold until about half of its volume. The plaster mold of the clay slurry was set under the arm of <b>jigger</b> <b>machine.</b> As the clay slurry came into contact with the vertically rotating head piece, it was pressed and spread until it finally became the shape of plaster mold.|$|R
50|$|Hans Heinrich Baumgarten (1806-1875) {{was from}} the town of Halstenbek near Pinneberg, in Schleswig-Holstein, an area of Germany that was then part of Denmark. He was apprenticed as a coffin maker by a farmer whose {{livestock}} he cared for. Later he was a carpenter before becoming a <b>machine</b> <b>minder</b> at the Danish newspaper Berlingske Tidende, whose printing office he later worked for in Berlin.|$|R

They are <b>machine</b> <b>minders</b> and no call is ever made on them to use their skill, their initiative or their intelligence." [...] It was, he felt, [...] "more important that industry should turn out excellent men and women than a flood of cheap and useful goods." [...] He looked forward to [...] "a new and better order of society which looks towards a better welfare of the people rather than towards national riches in the material sense." ...|$|R
6000|$|Their natural {{impulse was}} to {{maintain}} a [...] "distance." [...] But Denton's first idea of a dignified isolation from his new surroundings was soon rudely dispelled. He had imagined that his fall {{to the position of}} a Labour Serf was the end of his lesson, that when their little daughter had died he had plumbed the deeps of life; but indeed these things were only the beginning. Life demands something more from us than acquiescence. And now in a roomful of <b>machine</b> <b>minders</b> he was to learn a wider lesson, to make the acquaintance of another factor in life, a factor as elemental as the loss of things dear to us, more elemental even than toil.|$|R
40|$|Most of us {{depend on}} our hands for our livelihood. Even today when the skilled hand of the {{craftsman}} has largely {{been replaced by the}} simpler movements of the <b>machine</b> <b>minder,</b> very little can be done in industry without the skilled use of the worker's hands, and the effects of an injury to the hand are probably no less than the effects of damage to the eye or to the head. The objects of this study were: (1) to find out the causes of hand injuries amongst a group of men working in the north east of England; (2) to record the opinions of these men about why their injury happened; (3) to discuss prevention; (4) to enquire into the cost of these hand injuries, measured in terms of money and time lost by th...|$|R
5000|$|The Autotron spurred spinoffs: the Secatron (1954) for carton {{makers to}} ensure their {{pictures}} were centred; the Webatron for bag making machines; the Trakatron (1953) for the special requirements of cellophane and paper printers, and the Inkatron (1960) for sheet-fed offset presses. At the request of Sun Printers, Crosfield developed the Idotron (1956) to control ink viscosity, later superseded by the Viscomex (1959). In 1953 the technical director of Axel Springer, Germany's largest newspaper publisher, asked Crosfield to design equipment that would allow Springer to first print coloured illustrations, including advertising, in rotogravure and then re-reel to print the text on web offset. This led to the Insetter (1958) that revolutionised newspaper printing by permitting the economical use of colour. The Synchroscope gave <b>machine</b> <b>minders</b> the capacity to visualise images as they were being printed. In the US, Gravure Research Inc. commissioned Crosfield to develop equipment to stop [...] "speckling", undesirable white flecks in shadow areas. In 1966 the Heliostat, which applied an electric charge of several thousand volts to attract ink to paper, appeared. By then Crosfield {{had the support of}} a team of talented researchers, installation engineers, a production facility and sales and administrative staff.|$|R

5|$|Gerard Anthony Francis Conroy {{was born}} in Dublin to John (Jack) and Esther Conroy, {{and was one of}} ten siblings: Alphonsus (Ollie), Laurence (Lar), John (Donny), Rita, Peter, Michael, Vincent, Paul, and Marie. Christened as Gerard, he soon became known by the name Terry as he could not {{pronounce}} 'Gerard' as a young child. His mother held two jobs: as a factory worker and an office cleaner. The family lived in the suburb of Cabra, and had very limited finances. Being one of the younger children he was indulged, and took advantage of his lack of household chores to spend the majority of his time playing football in the street. However he was arrested by a plain-clothed policeman and sentenced to probation in Children's Court for playing football in the street. He later credited his ball control skills to the many years he spent playing football with large numbers of other children in the tight streets of Cabra. His father and brothers were in the printing trade, and his brother Ollie, a talented footballer, rejected the opportunity to turn professional at Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1950 in order to remain employed in Dublin as a <b>machine</b> <b>minder</b> and play football part-time in the League of Ireland. Three more of his brothers also played in the League of Ireland, and both Ollie and Michael played in the Shelbourne team that won the FAI Cup in 1960.|$|R
6000|$|There came also {{practical}} psychologists {{with some}} very interesting developments {{in the art of}} hypnotism. The names of Milne Bramwell, Fechner, Liebault, William James, Myers and Gurney, he found, bore a value now that would have astonished their contemporaries. Several practical applications of psychology were now in general use; it had largely superseded drugs, antiseptics and anesthetics in medicine; was employed by almost all who had any need of mental concentration. A real enlargement of human faculty seemed to have been effected in this direction. The feats of [...] "calculating boys," [...] the wonders, as Graham had been wont to regard them, of mesmerisers, were now within the range of anyone who could afford the services of a skilled hypnotist. Long ago the old examination methods in education had been destroyed by these expedients. Instead of years of study, candidates had substituted a few weeks of trances, and during the trances expert coaches had simply to repeat all the points necessary for adequate answering, adding a suggestion of the post-hypnotic recollection of these points. In process mathematics particularly, this aid had been of singular service, and it was now invariably invoked by such players of chess and games of manual dexterity as were still to be found. In fact, all operations conducted under finite rules, of a quasi-mechanical sort that is, were now systematically relieved from the wanderings of imagination and emotion, and brought to an unexampled pitch of accuracy. Little children of the labouring classes, so soon as they were of sufficient age to be hypnotised, were thus converted into beautifully punctual and trustworthy <b>machine</b> <b>minders,</b> and released forthwith from the long, long thoughts of youth. Aeronautical pupils, who gave way to giddiness, could be relieved from their imaginary terrors. In every street were hypnotists ready to print permanent memories upon the mind. If anyone desired to remember a name, a series of numbers, a song or a speech, it could be done by this method, and conversely memories could be effaced, habits removed, and desires eradicated--a sort of psychic surgery was, in fact, in general use. Indignities, humbling experiences, were thus forgotten, widows would obliterate their previous husbands, angry lovers release themselves from their slavery. To graft desires, however, was still impossible, and the facts of thought transference were yet unsystematised. The psychologists illustrated their expositions with some astounding experiments in mnemonics made through the agency of a troupe of pale-faced children in blue.|$|R
5000|$|Until 1971, all {{the clay}} {{used at the}} Pottery Works came from South Amboy, NJ, and the cobalt used for the blue slip {{decoration}} came from Germany. From 1972 the clay came from Ohio. For more than 80 years the company used the same apple wood drying boards to stack greenware in the drying room. These were the same boards used by the Boston and Sandwich Glass Company on Cape Cod, a defunct company that Henderson bought in whole. The method of production changed very little over time. It was a small factory whose products were handcrafted. Even the jiggering of forms utilized older labor-intensive technology that other commercial potteries had long since abandoned for automated <b>machine</b> <b>jigger</b> units. Pieces were mostly hand-formed, handles were applied individually, pieces were hand dipped in glazes, and shapes were developed to meet custom orders.|$|R
40|$|The {{chemical}} composition of coal mineral matter, {{and particularly the}} content of major elements (Al, Si, Fe, Ca, K, Na, Mg), {{plays an important role}} in the processing and use of bituminous coals. Mineral matter is the ballast, reducing the calorific value of the fuel. The aim of the study was to analyze the concentrations of main elements of coking coal mineral matter and products of its cleaning in heavy media, <b>jiggers</b> and flotation <b>machines.</b> Analysis of elements was performed through the technique of the atomic absorption spectrometry AAS. The results of main elements concentrations of coal mineral matter and its cleaning products are discussed in relation to each operation of mechanical treatment. As a result of the cleaning process in heavy media, the content of mineral substances decreased seven times, mainly due to the removal of components such as silicon, aluminum and iron from coal. Similar results were obtained in the case of cleaning in jiggers, leading to a significant reduction of the contents of silicates and aluminosilicates. In both cases, there was an increase in the content of sodium. Despite the significant reduction of the contents of alkali metals’ compounds, their content in concentrates as converted to oxides is quite high (0, 43 – 0, 81 % of dry coal). The lowest alkalis content is the displayed by a coal concentrate from the flotation process dewatered in a centrifuge...|$|R
