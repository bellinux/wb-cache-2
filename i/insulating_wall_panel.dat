This allows for designs that don’t require as much concrete cover, so concrete structures can be lighter and much more durable than before. For instance, using carbon fiber grid in <b>insulated</b> <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> can provide a stronger, lighter, more thermally efficient panel than is practical with conventional designs. Due to the lighter weight less energy is required to provide the necessary concrete and ship products adding an environmental incentive to using this technology.|$|R

40|$|The common {{practice}} in corbel design is {{to block out the}} insulation in order to provide a solid concrete area at the corbel location. This connection practice results in thermal bridging, which significantly reduces the energy performance of the panel. For example, the PCI Design Handbook indicates that the reduction in thermal resistance caused by a solid part with an area equal to 9 % of the total panel surface area is as high as 42 %. This paper presents a discussion of a new concept for corbel design of <b>insulated</b> <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> with the thermal break totally preserved. Two different designs are presented. The structural capacity of the two connections was determined analytically and verified experimentally. The results of the research are encouraging.

The required capacity of 42, 000 pounds is shown to be exceeded by a significant margin. The reinforcement is relatively light and the precast production is relatively simple.

Since the vacuum insulation panels are encased in a metallized laminates as barriers against permeation of moisture and gas, special attention was given to the edge effects. Stepwise adjustment of the measured and calculated results reported here provide a general assessment of the efficacy of this insulation system applied on different wall materials. A functional representation of the measured data, for steady-state conditions, is introduced.

Suitable finite element models of LSF walls were then developed and validated by comparing with test results. In this study, the validated finite element models of LSF <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> subject to standard fire conditions were used in a detailed parametric study to investigate the effects of important parameters such as steel grade and thickness, plasterboard screw spacing, plasterboard lateral restraint, insulation materials and load ratio on their performance under standard fire conditions. Suitable equations were proposed to predict the time-temperature profiles of LSF wall studs with eight different plasterboard-insulation configurations, and used in the finite element analyses. Finite element parametric studies produced extensive fire performance data for the LSF <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> {{in the form of}} load ratio versus time and critical hot flange (failure) temperature curves for eight wall configurations.

Ten specimens of SWPs were tested under displacement control subjected to four-point concentrated loads. The test results showed that the SWPs reinforced with GFRP grids as shear connectors developed a high degree of composite action resulting in high flexural strength. The specimens with EPS foam exhibited an enhanced load-displacement behavior compared with the specimens with XPS because of the relatively stronger bond between insulation and concrete.

40|$|The core {{characteristics}} of Hawaii have long created a difficult {{market for the}} design and construction of modern high-quality homes. Although strategically located in the Pacific and blessed with a lush, resourceful environment, Hawaii is relatively far from other industrial centers and has a limited supply of land. Land and building materials are often cost prohibitive, {{and the quality of}} housing suffers accordingly. Large developers have a distinct advantage in this environment and they continue to build low-quality homes that they can sell for premium prices. As a result, the residents of Hawaii consistently get “less” housing for “more” cost relative to other markets in the United States. This project investigates how modern prefabrication technologies in architecture can be utilized to create high-quality, high-performance homes at lower costs in Honolulu, Hawaii’s urban center. Whereas previous prefabrication efforts have required mass production or standardization to be economically viable, advances in digital design and fabrication are now allowing architects to design and build cheaper and in non-conventional ways. These emerging technologies will help architects introduce creative but cost-effective housing solutions appropriate to Hawaii in a market dominated by generic and limited developer-driven housing.

The experimental results indicate that the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> which has a better performance of the force and can be used to be the bearing wall of a building can form a novel structural system. When the beams supporting the <b>wall</b> <b>panels,</b> the <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> which under the beams is in local state of compression. It were gained that when the <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> are in the local compression state, local pressure loads are primarily borne by the concrete core columns and fiber gypsum board will damage in advance through the eighteen experimental <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> specimens which in local compression. The test results show that the final destruction of the concrete is caused by being crushed and the contribution of the gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> to local compression bearing is small. Compressive stress can only spread in the local loading on concrete core columns, cannot be expanded into an adjacent stud. Finally, the local compression bearing capacity calculation formula of the concrete-filled glass fiber reinforced gypsum <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> is obtained by analysis of the test results...|$|R
40|$|<b>Wall</b> <b>panels</b> are {{one result}} of {{technological}} developments {{in the field of}} precast concrete. At the present time more <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> used in construction compared {{with the use of a}} brick because of the characteristics of the <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> that have relatively light so it does not leave a huge burden for a construction. Behavior wall in receiving shear loads usually begins with the onset of cracks on the walls to collapse. Behavior wall in receiving shear loads usually begins with the onset of cracks on the walls until collapse. Testing shear strength of <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> is done by giving the load on the upper end of the wall, loads the observed every 5 KN until it reaches the maximum load, observing the pattern of cracks and shifts that occur. Data obtained is load up to the maximum load, the pattern of cracks that occur, and changes or shifts in the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> caused by loading. The results of research and discussion showed that the <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> with diagonal reinforcement bamboo has a shear stiffness and shear strength is better than a <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> without reinforcement. <b>Wall</b> <b>panels</b> with diagonal reinforcement reinforcement bamboo has a shear rigidity 3123. 27 KN / m while the <b>walls</b> of the <b>panel</b> without reinforcement only get shear stiffness of 2210. 40 KN / m. From these results prove that the reinforcement of bamboo able to add greater shear stiffness and reduced deflection that occurs. <b>Wall</b> <b>panels</b> with diagonal reinforcement of bamboo has a greater stiffness because bamboo has a higher tensile strength so that it can withstand deflection that occurs. It can be concluded <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> with a diagonal bamboo reinforcement bars can be used as a substitute for conventional brick wall...|$|R
40|$|This study {{presents}} a cellular automata (CA) method {{to map the}} cracking patterns of laterally loaded masonry <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> with openings. Firstly, the central point displacement of each CA cell is calculated from the finite element method (FEM). Then, the displacements are normalized to form the CA state value mode of the <b>wall</b> <b>panel.</b> Next, a maximum correlation coefficient criterion is proposed to match the zone similarity between the base (tested) and new (analyzed) <b>wall</b> <b>panels.</b> Finally, the criterion for judging cracking zone is adopted to map the cracking pattern of the new <b>wall</b> <b>panel.</b> The case studies indicate that the mapped cracking patterns of <b>wall</b> <b>panels</b> agree well with the testing results, which verify {{the validity of the}} criterion for matching zone similarity...|$|R
40|$|A {{simulation}} {{program was}} developed to determine the thermal and moisture characteristics in an <b>insulated</b> <b>wall</b> where airflow may occur. The calculated result was compared with the experimental results for full-scale <b>insulated</b> <b>wall.</b> Results suggested {{that there may be}} some difference in permeability or space between insulating material and other material. The validity of the simulation program was also assessed. Using this simulation program, {{we will be able to}} calculate temperature and humidity inside the wall, when measured temperature and humidity are available. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Steel fabric {{reinforced}} concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> {{is the new}} method currently used to replace the conventional wall. The formwork used {{for the construction of}} the wall is replace by using tunnel form system. It is fast and cost effective compared to the conventional and some other methods. Steel fabric which also known as wire mesh are used as the reinforcement for the <b>wall</b> <b>panel.</b> It is practically provide a faster installation compared to normal bars. Since this method is still new in Malaysia, a specific guide of this method is not established yet to use as a guideline in designing the building structures. Then, the study of this structural element analysis needs to be carried out. This research will compared the structural performance of steel fabric {{reinforced concrete}} <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> and to analyzed t e structural capacity and mode of failure of steel fabric reinforced concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> by previous researcher. This research used Finite Element Method computer program LUSAS 13. 6 as a tool to analyze the <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> The 3 -Dimensional model of steel fabric reinforced concrete <b>wall</b> <b>panel</b> with double layer of wire fabric type B 7 with half of actual size 75 x 1000 x 1500 mm and 150 x 3000 x 3000 mm (Width:Length:Height) was simulated. This model assigned assigning concrete Grade C 30 (BS 8110 : 1997) and strength characteristic, fy= 485 N/mm 2 for the steel fabric reinforcement.
