As the wheel rotates, the flange tends to climb up the <b>flange</b> <b>angle.</b> It is held down by the vertical load on the wheel V, so that if L/V exceeds the trigonometrical tangent of the flange contact angle, climbing will take place. The wheel flange will climb to the rail head where there is no lateral resistance in rolling movement, and a flange climbing derailment usually takes place. In Diagram 5 the flange contact angle is quite steep, and flange climbing is unlikely. However, if the rail head is side-worn (side-cut) or the flange is worn, as shown in Diagram 6 the contact angle is much flatter and flange climbing is more likely.|$|E

The purpose of the given work is to research the actual stress-train state of the point of connection of the stringers with the floor beams on condition of their staged interposition. It is also necessary to determine possible effect of coupled work of deck beam grid and booms on their stress-strain state. Methodology. To reach {{the purpose of the}} study the testing of the existing bridge was conducted. To measure strains (stresses) in the span elements we used the strain gages glued to <b>flange</b> <b>angles</b> of stringers and floor beams and to fillets of lower <b>flange</b> <b>angles</b> of stringers in the points of their support on floor beams. To measure deflections of the truss, stringers and floor beams from static loads we used Aistov’s and Maksimov’s deflectometers, that were installed on lower boom in the middle of span 0 - 1, as well as on both stringers and floor beams in the middle of the span. Deflectometers were fastened to the span and, by wire communication, to the ground surface. Findings. Stress-strain state of the point of connection of the stringers with the floor beams on condition of their staged interposition was obtained and analyzed. Analysis indicates that, apart from vertical bending of the stringers and beams, there is a significant effect of horizontal bending of floor beams and their torsion, that occur due to the coupled work of track-way beams and top booms, both for P 0 beam and for other beams.

While testing the span under the train load, there are significant additional stresses from horizontal bending of floor beams and their torsion in the floor beam flanges.

40|$|Abstract:-In {{the current}} {{practice}} of analysis {{and design of}} steel-frame building structure, the actual behaviour of beam-column connection is generally simplified to the two idealized extremes of either fully regid behaviour or ideally pinned behaviour. However, most connections used in current practice actually exhibit semi-rigid deformation behaviour that can contribute substantially to overall displacements of the structure and to the distribution of member forces. So it is very necessary that studying the behavior of these semi-rigid connections under cyclic reversal loading. Three full-scale specimens of angles steel using H-section members had been conducted. The specimens were subjected to cyclic reversal loading simulating earthquake effects on a steel moment-resisting force. The objective {{of the work is}} to determine the behavior of these connections under cyclic reversal loading well into the inelastic range and to ascertain the effect of design parameters such as column flange stiffener, pre-tension of bolts and the <b>angles</b> <b>flange</b> thickness on the overall behavior. Observations were made concerning the response of the connections and its elements in terms of strength, stiffness and energy dissipation. Information on the design of these connections is presented. The hysteretic behavior of angles beam-column connections under cyclic loading is presented in this paper. Rotational stiffness, the carrying capacity and ductility of top-seat and web angles connections are analyzed. It is concluded that angles connections can possess the relative high stiffness, strength and excellent ductility as moment-resisting components in the seismic design of frames.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine the relative proportions of the <b>flange</b> <b>angles</b> necessary to make an axially compressed plate reach any buckling strength up to 60, 000 psi. ^ The principal variables which were investigated were the L/b ratio for the plate, the b/t ratio for the plate, and the size of edge angles. Steel of various yield points was used, with the maximum being about 75, 000 psi. The range of the variables was so chosen as to cover the current practice and extend considerably above the values now being generally used. ^ Eighty column specimens have been tested under axial compression with lateral support so arranged as to simulate the effect of lacing bars as used in column design. The specimens were built up channels each consisting of a web plate with edge angles on one face. The test columns are arranged in fifteen series such that the only variable for a given series is the size of edge angles used. ^ SR- 4 strain gages were used to determine the stress distribution throughout the member and to measure the stresses during buckling. Mechanical dial indicators were used to determine the overall change in length of the specimen and the lateral deflections due to the axial loading. ^ Lateral support for the specimens was provided at the third points along each edge of the plate. ^ Principal results and conclusions are as follows: (1) It is possible to stiffen plates with edge angles so that they will carry the stress given by the Bryan formula for an axially compressed plate with simple supports along the longitudinal edges. (2) Present methods of analysis do check the experimental results. (3) With proper care the current limit of b/t for web plates may be considerably exceeded.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} demand of reducing the body weight of automobiles, the utilization of advanced high strength steel has increased dramatically in recent years. However, high residual stress and redundant strain caused by the traditional cold roll forming process is still an outstanding problem. Under such circumstances, the Chain-die forming method is developed as a novel sheet metal forming approach which combines roll forming and stamping processes. A Chain-die former employs discrete die blocks which run on a chain track with significant virtual roll radius, simulating a roll forming process. Meanwhile, individual pairs of die blocks deform the sheet metal gradually acting as a stamping process. Through the enlargement of virtual roll radius, the peak longitudinal strain developed during the forming process is dramatically decreased (contained in the elastic region), leading to significantly reduced residual stress and almost no redundant deformation. Due to low longitudinal strain, the cross-sections of the product {{can be considered as}} a plane strain state throughout the entire forming process, allowing utilization of 2 -D plane strain simulations to represent for 3 -D simulations. In this paper, using 2 -D FE stamping simulations and 3 -D FE Chain-die forming simulations in assisting die design for a Chain-die formed threshold product using AHSS material is discussed. The results show 2 -D stamping simulations are able to predict the average forming angles of 3 -D simulation results with high accuracy and much higher efficiency.

40|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} has been performed characterizing the in-plane fiber-dominated properties, under both static and fatigue loading, of advanced composite materials. To the author's knowledge, no study has been performed to date investigating fatigue characteristics in the transverse direction. This information {{is important in the}} design of bonded composite airframe structure where repeated, cyclic out-of-plane bending may occur. Recent tests characterizing skin/stringer debond failures in reinforced composite panels where the dominant loading in the skin is flexure {{along the edge of the}} frame indicate failure initiated either in the skin or else the flange, near the flange tip. When failure initiated in the skin, transverse matrix cracks formed in the surface skin ply closest to the flange and either initiated delaminations or created matrix cracks in the next lower ply, which in turn initiated delaminations. When failure initiated in the flanges, transverse cracks formed in the <b>flange</b> <b>angle</b> ply closest to the skin and initiated delamination. In no configuration did failure propagate through the adhesive bond layer. For the examined skin/flange configurations, the maximum transverse tension stress at failure correlates very well with the transverse tension strength of the composites. Transverse tension strength (static) data of graphite epoxy composites have been shown to vary with the volume of material stressed. As the volume of material stressed increased, the strength decreased. A volumetric scaling law based on Weibull statistics can be used to predict the transverse strength measurements. The volume dependence reflects the presence of inherent flaws in the microstructure of the lamina. A similar approach may be taken to determine a volume scale effect on the transverse tension fatigue behavior of graphite/epoxy composites. The objective of this work is to generate transverse tension strength and fatigue S-N characteristics for composite materials using 3 -point flexure tests of 90 deg graphite/epoxy specimens. Investigations will include the volume scale effect as well as frequency and span-to-thickness ratio effects. Prior to the start of the experimental study, an analytical study using finite element modeling will be performed to investigate the span-to-thickness effect.

The process that has been chosen to produce the ribs is a combination of resin infusion and autoclave technology because this combination offers a wide bandwidth of process parameter variation. The rib design with one integrated rib foot and one integrated rib post has been offered a good combination of simplicity and degree of structural integration. Since the mould line is not critical from a CTE point of view it was possible to use a cost efficient aluminium male tooling which has been designed to produce two different ribs in one cycle. <b>Flange</b> <b>angle</b> of the rib foot and rib post have been designed to compensate “Spring-In” deformations in a formally defined production window. Process-induced distortions (PID) of the ribs have been predicted with a novel pheno-numerical simulation approach that has been introduced within the LOCOMACHS project. The methodology provides efficient PID predictions due to shell-element modeling and a significant reduction of corresponding simulation parameters. To ensure that all quality relevant production parameters are in the specified production window a network of ultrasonic sensors has been installed in a special pattern. A crucial advantage of the ultrasonic sensors is that they are installed on the accessible backside of the mould and do not affect the mould line side. By measuring and analyzing sound amplitudes and propagation times it was possible to monitor flow front propagation, laminate thickness and also the cure progress in the running process. To manipulate the process conditions {{on the basis of the}} gained information, the injection pressure of the two injection lines could be used to tune resin flow, the pressure difference between autoclave and injection system could be used to control laminate thickness and the temperature profile can be manipulated in function of the cure progress.

Three temper conditions were considered including O-, H 22 - and H 24 -temper. Two custom tooling sets were designed to form U-shaped channels, allowing forming temperature, blank holding force and lubricant type to be varied. The forming temperature range considered was from room temperature to 300 °C. The formed specimen cross sections were measured and the net shape was evaluated {{in terms of the}} measured versus ideal sidewall angle. Tensile tests were conducted to characterize material behaviour for the range of temperature considered in the forming experiments. The results showed thermal softening and increased strain-rate sensitivity at elevated temperature in the O-, H 22 -, and H 24 -tempers, which results in lower forming stresses and thus lower springback. The room temperature strength is recovered after warm forming. Ductility increased significantly at elevated temperature; however, the harder temper conditions exhibited negative strain hardening for high temperatures at strains beyond the ultimate tensile strength. The experiments revealed that springback reduced steadily for all three tempers as the forming temperature was increased from room temperature to 250 °C. The effect of temperature on springback was relatively small for the O-temper condition, but significant for the high-strength tempers. At a forming temperature of 250 °C, the H 22 -and H 24 -tempers exhibited springback reduction of 95 % and 92 %, in terms of deviation from the ideal sidewall angle, relative to springback at room temperature, respectively. The stress-strain data was used to create a numerical model for predicting springback after U-channel forming. One challenge in developing constitutive model parameters for this work was the negative hardening response exhibited by the harder temper conditions at higher temperatures. This caused numerical instabilities, requiring the use of approximate fits to the material response. The sidewall angle deviation and <b>flange</b> <b>angle</b> were predicted after springback. The numerical models qualitatively captured the reduction in springback with increase in forming temperature, but quantitative differences in the predicted and measured extent of springback exist.

Water had entered the submerged torpedo room and rivets had sheared in the vertical <b>flange</b> of the <b>angle</b> iron securing the deck armour in place. The exact cause remains uncertain, but Courageous received [...] of stiffening in response; Glorious did not receive her stiffening until 1918. Courageous also was temporarily fitted as a minelayer in April 1917, but never actually laid any mines. In mid-1917 both ships received a dozen torpedo tubes in pairs: one mount {{on each side of}} the mainmast on the upper deck and two mounts {{on each side of the}} rear turret on the quarterdeck. Courageous and Glorious served together throughout the war. Both ships were initially assigned to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron and later reconstituted the 1st Cruiser Squadron (CS).|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In case of {{sheet metal}} forming the main {{dimensional}} errors are caused by the springback phenomena. The present work deals with numerical simulation related to draw bending and springback of U- shaped parts. The current paper is trying to prove out {{the important role of}} the blank holder force variation during the forming process. The Dynaform 5. 8 software was used to simulate the forming process, in which the blank holder force varies in four steps between 0 and 50 kN. The factorial simulations test plan was made to cover completely the variation domain and 256 simulations were necessarily to be performed. The part obtained after each simulation is analyzed and measured to quantify the errors caused by springback. Parameters as: <b>angle</b> between <b>flange</b> and sidewall, <b>angle</b> between sidewall and part bottom, chamfer radius between part bottom and sidewall or chamfer radius between sidewall and flange are recorded in a data base. The initial simulations plan together with the generated data base is used as an input for the genetic algorithm optimization method. With the optimized process parameters a new simulation is made and the final shape of the part is compared with the ideal geometry. The shape of the part obtained with the optimized parameters is proving the capability of the proposed method...|$|R
40|$|Chain die forming is a {{new type}} of sheet metal forming process. The {{material}} flow law and characteristics of chain die forming process were studied through simulation. The analysis results show that the maximum principal strain {{at the corner of the}} variable section forming part is larger, and the direction is perpendicular to the outside bending surface; the maximum principal strain at the concave arc region in the flange is tensile strain, which decreases along the height direction of flange from high to low; the flange height and forming angle have great influence on the longitudinal strain of the forming part, and increasing the height of the <b>flange</b> and forming <b>angle</b> can increase the longitudinal strain of the flange; the effect of material properties on the longitudinal strain of the forming part is small. The longitudinal strain of the variable cross section was extracted from the simulation model. The results show that the four arc zones in the flange of variable cross section part have larger longitudinal strain, where tensile or compressive deformation occur during forming process, but the equivalent plastic strain mainly concentrates in bending areas of variable cross section part. The simulated results were verified through experiment of chain die forming of variable cross section tests, and the experimental results are in good agreement with the simulation results...|$|R
30|$|Nonlinear {{finite element}} (FE) static {{analyses}} of top- and seat-angle connections were performed using ABAQUS standard {{to investigate the}} influence of connection parameters and its properties on prying action developed due to the interaction between column <b>flange</b> and top <b>angle’s</b> vertical leg. Contact phenomenon between two interfaces with finite sliding and bolt pretension in the initial step of analysis was considered in the FE model. FE analysis results were compared with the experimental ones to examine {{the applicability of the}} FE model. Then, the location of plastic hinges in connection assemblages was investigated at the ultimate state of the connection and a parametric study was performed varying connection parameters, material properties of connection assemblages, and magnitude of bolt pretension to visualize their effects on prying force and on the position of prying force on top angle’s vertical leg. Current study shows that plastic hinges not only develop at top angle’s heel and bolt hole region but also in the bolt shank that differs from some assumptions of power model (Kishi and Chen 1990): (1) top angle thickness and gage distance from angle heel to bolt hole center line have an distinct effect on prying action; and (2) distributed prying force developed near the region of the top edge of tension angle’s leg adjacent to column flange can contribute to the failure of the connection. Finally, a mathematical formulation to identify the location of prying force action point is proposed.|$|R
