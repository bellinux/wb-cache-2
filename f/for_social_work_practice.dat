It is also important for the social worker to recognize the intersecting nature of oppression. A non-judgmental and unbiased attitude is necessary {{on the part of the}} social worker. The worker must begin to understand oppression and marginalization as a systemic problem, not the fault of the individual (Mullaly, 2007).|$|E

In 1919, the State {{legislature}} passed a law that required every county to organize for public welfare services and to employ a superintendent of public welfare.

From the beginning, the School had {{a strong commitment to}} public service with a basic orientation to sociology and social problems. Its mission was to offer instruction in social problems, to prepare students <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practice</b> and for community leadership, to provide service to North Carolina, and to carry on research and publish findings. The School was productively and cordially related to county welfare departments and to the North Carolina Department of Public Welfare.|$|E

40|$|Objectives: Based on {{the concept}} of Expressed Emotion (EE), this study {{attempted}} to explore the underlying socio-cultural factors that were related to the unique patterns of communication found between Chinese caregivers and their relatives with schizophrenia. Methods: Twelve caregivers were given in-depth interviews, and the transcripts were content-analyzed to delineate the unique communication patterns found between caregivers and their relatives with schizophrenia. Thematic analyses were also performed to extricate the possible underlying factors associated with such unique communication patterns. Results: While certain themes such as the lack of knowledge of mental illness, attribution of symptoms to personality causes and feelings of psychological burdens were closely associated with negative communication patterns of critical comments, hostility and emotional over-involvement, parental commitment, knowledge of mental illness and recognition of positive attributes in relatives were linked to positive communication patterns of warmth and optimism towards illness. Discussions: Socio-cultural factors such as stigma of mental illness, Confucian work ethics, parental self-sacrificing and devoted behaviors, and acceptance of fate were put forward to explain the findings. Implications <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practices</b> were discussed...|$|R
40|$|The present paper explores whether {{sufficient}} grounds {{exist for}} articulating an indigenous value base <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practice.</b> Since the value base is fundamental for practice, {{it seems that}} the call for the development of an indigenous social work practice requires an indigenous value base to guide it. However, in the eyes of skeptics, the idea of an indigenous value base <b>for</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> <b>practice</b> {{may be the result of}} a conceptual confusion between 'positive' and 'normative' morality. To illustrate the need for making this distinction, this paper critically appraises the literature that argues for indigenization based on the recognition of the diversity and differences of cultural values. Building on this analysis, the paper suggests that we need to re-examine the conceptual issue of whether the assumption of the discontinuity of social explanation and normative evaluation is warranted.
