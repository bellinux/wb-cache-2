40|$|Electrochemical {{machining}} with an oscillating electrode and {{pulsed current}} (PECM) is an innovative manufacturing {{process for the}} production of tools and machine elements with highest precision requirements. Currently structure sizes < 1 mm and a flatness of < 5 µm are achievable with PECM. Machining of circumferential surfaces, however, is only possible with substantially reduced precision, which strongly limits the applicability of the method in particular {{for the production of}} rotationally symmetrical workpieces.

40|$|Abstract. A new finish method uses an {{effective}} electrode connecting with a nonconductive grinding tool {{to execute the}} design of compound processes of electrochemical finishing and grinding following turning is investigated. The submitted processes {{can be used for}} various turning operations. Through simple equipment attachment, electrochemical finishing and grinding can follow to execute the finishing process on the same machine. Among the factors affecting electrochemical finishing the performance of grinding combined with electrochemical finishing is primarily discussed. In the experiment, the electrode is used with continuous and pulsed direct current. The grinding tool moves following the electrode and grinds the workpiece surface. The experimental parameters are electrical current rating, feed rate of electrode and grinding tool, rotational speed of workpiecel, pulsed period, and geometry of finish-tool. The results show that pulsed direct current with longer off-time can slightly improve the finish effect for its dregs discharge mobility. Using an adequate rotational speed of workpiece with high rotational speed is advantageous to the finish effect. A thinner plate-form electrode with a smaller end radius is associated with larger discharge space and produces higher current density and provides faster feed rate and a better finish effect. The grinding c{{an effective}}ly increase the finish effect.

40|$|Purpose: The ultrasonic-aided {{electrochemical}} finishing following traditional turning by a turning-form electrode {{for several}} die materials is demonstrated. Design/methodology/approach: A guide {{line for the}} design process is followed a scientific method including the design requirement, design development, detail design, and experimental analysis is adopted in the current study. The proposed design of turning-form electrode combined with the ultrasonic-aided electrochemical finishing is presented. Findings: Smaller end radius and smaller declination angle are associated with higher current density and provides larger discharge space and better polishing effect. The plate-shape electrode with small end radius and decreasing the surface area of top-view performs the best. The ultrasonic assistance can avoid the difficulty of dreg discharge in the electrochemical finishing, thus increasing the finishing effect. Research limitations/implications: The potential for electrode design and using ultrasonic energy transmitted to the electrolyte to assist discharging dregs out of electrode gap during the electrochemical finishing {{is yet to be}} explored. Practical implications: This process can be used for various turning operations including end turning, form turning, and flute and thread cutting. Through simple equipment attachment, the electrochemical finishing can follow the cutting on the same machine and chuck. Originality/value: It is a great contribution that the ultrasonic-aided <b>electrochemical</b> finishing after <b>turning</b> process just needs quite short time than manual or machine finishing to make the surface of workpiece smooth and bright.

40|$|While stable polymer {{electrochromic}} {{properties are}} mainly realized from the electrochemical oxidation of p-type conjugated polymers, {{in this paper}} we report that stable electrochromic properties can also be easily achieved by electrochemical reduction of n-type polymers, such as PF 4 Ox, an alternating copolymer of quater(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene) and oxadiazole. The introduction of the strong electron-accepting oxadiazole unit into the poly(9, 9 -dioctylfluorene) main chain promoted the stability of the polymer in the electrochemical reduction. The copolymer film displayed an excellent elecrochromic property upon <b>electrochemical</b> reduction, which <b>turned</b> the colorless film at the neutral state to rosy-red at the electron charged state with a switching time of 1. 1 s. The film exhibited a high stability during the electrochromic test, having only 30 % loss of the transmittance change in 500 potential square-wave cycles. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) study revealed that decay of the electrochromic performance of the film was associated with the formation of fluorenone and quinone defects on the fluorene unit in the copolymer chain. The laser flash photolysis test showed the monomer unit had a high potential to localize an electron and became highly vulnerable to be attacked by oxygen to form the defects. These defects would act as charge carrier traps and produced a pair of inner peaks at - 1. 84 and 1. 03 V in the cyclic voltammetry test of the copolymer film.

40|$|Few-walled carbon {{nanotubes}} (FWNTs) have 2 to 3 {{layers of}} sidewalls with diameters ranging from 3 to 8 nm and length around tens of micrometers; they are unique MWNTs with perfect graphitization structure as in single walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs). Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) are special type of FWNTs which are considered as the intermediate between SWNTs and MWNTs, respectively. Many of the applications proposed for DWNTs require the precise {{control of their}} diameters. In this dissertation we describe a simple, scalable approach for the selective synthesis of high-quality DWNTs by carbon monoxide chemical vapor deposition (CO-CVD) method. The inner-tube diameter distribution measured by HRTEM is about 0. 7 ~ 1. 1 nm. The structural correlation and optical properties of high quality DWNTs were also exploited. To further exploit the excellent properties of FWNTs, {{it is necessary to}} functionalize them and make well dispersed solution. FWNTs have been chemically functionalized via efficient ultrasound-mediated dissolving metal method and ultrasound-mediated oxidation method. Such methods can be generalized towards other types of CNTs and the chemically functionalized CNTs are highly soluble in various organic solvents and aqueous solution respectively. The reported fluorescence from inner shells of double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWCNTs) is an intriguing and potentially useful property. A combination of bulk and single-molecule methods was used to study the spectroscopy, chemical quenching, mechanical rigidity, density, and TEM structures of the near-IR emitters in DWCNT samples. It is found that DWCNT inner shell fluorescence is weaker than SWCNT fluorescence by a factor of at least 10, 000. The near-IR emission from DWCNT samples actually arises from SWCNT impurities. Compared to SWNTs and MWNTs, the thin FWNTs are believed to have extraordinary mechanical properties. The mechanical properties of composite films (CNTs/PVA) have been investigated. It is observed that the Young's modulus of composite films with only 0. 2 wt % functionalized FWNTs shows a remarkable reinforcement. In addition, the Young's modulus increased steadily with the increased concentration of FWNTs. In order to tackle the problem of the poor conductivity of the metal oxides, we have designed a ternary nanocomposite film composed of metal oxide (MnO 2), functionalized FWNTs and conducting polymer (CP). Each component in the MnO 2 /CNT/CP film provides unique and critical function to achieve optimized <b>electrochemical</b> properties. It <b>turned</b> out that the electrodes exhibited excellent electrochemical properties. Dissertatio...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{dedicated}} to development and application of a novel large-scale first-principles approach to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of realistic nanoscale materials. Electron transport at the nanometer scale involves phenomena which are {{beyond the realm of}} classical transport theory: the wave character of the electrons becomes central, and the Schrddinger equation needs to be solved explicitly. First-principles calculations can nowadays deal with systems containing hundreds of electrons, but simulations for nanostructures that contain thousands of atoms or more need to rely on parametrized Hamiltonians. The core of our approach lies in the derivation of exact and chemically-specific Hamiltonians from first-principles calculations, in a basis of maximally-localized Wannier functions, that become explicit tight-binding orbitals. Once this optimal basis is determined, the Hamiltonian matrix becomes short-ranged, diagonally-dominant, and transferable - i. e. a large nanostructure can be constructed by assembling together the Hamiltonians of its constitutive building block. This approach is first demonstrated for pristine semiconducting and metallic nanotubes, demonstrating perfect agreement with full first-principles calculations in a complete planewave basis. (cont.) Then, it is applied to study the electronic structure and quantum conductance of functionalized carbon nanotubes. The first class of functionalizing addends, represented by single-bond covalent ligands (e. g. hydrogens or aryls), turns out to affect very strongly the back-scattering and the conductance, since sp 3 rehybridization at the sidewall carbon where a group is attached dramatically perturbs the conjugated [pi]-bonding network. Inspection on the shape and the on-site energy of MLWFs before and after functionalizations leads {{to the conclusion that the}} effect of sp 3 rehybridization is essentially identical to removing a "half-filled" p-orbital from the [pi]-manifold. In this perspective, the chemical difference between functional groups (e. g. different electronegativity of the residues) is relatively minor, even if, of course, will lead to different doping of the tube. We also find that these single-bond ligands tend to cluster, and are more stable when two groups are located nearby (incidentally, the degree of perturbation at the Fermi level becomes weaker when such paired configuration is assumed). The second class of functionalizing addends, represented by cycloaddition functionalizations (e. g. carbenes and nitrenes), demonstrates a radically different behavior. (cont.) These addends are bonded to two neighboring sidewall carbon atoms, creating a three-membered ring structure. On narrow-diameter tubes, cleaving of the sidewall bond takes place to release the high strain energy of a three-membered ring. In the process, the two sidewall carbons recover their original sp 2 hybridization. This step is crucial, since the quantum conductance of a metallic nanotube then recovers almost perfectly the ideal limit of a pristine tube: the bond cleavage restores a transparent conduction manifold. Bond cleavage is controlled by the chemistry of the functional groups and the curvature of the nanotubes. High-curvature favors bond opening, whereas in graphene the bond is always closed; in between the two limits, chemistry determines the critical curvature at which the open-to-closed transition takes place. The preference for bond opening or closing has been screened extensively for different classes of functional groups, using initially some molecular homologues of the nanotubes. It is found that a subclass of addends, exemplified by dicyanocarbene, can assume both the open and closed form in the same tube around a narrow range of diameters. (cont.) While these two forms are very similar in energy, and separated by a small barrier (hence they can be considered "fluxional" tautomers), the quantum conductance in the closed case is found to be significantly lower than that in the open case. Interconversion between the two minima could then be directed by optical or <b>electrochemical</b> means, in <b>turn</b> controlling the conductance of the functionalized tubes. We envision thus that this novel class of functionalization will offer a practical way toward non-destructive chemistry that can either preserve the metallic conductance of the tubes, or modulate it in real-time, with foreseeable applications in memories, sensors, imaging, and optoelectronic devices. by Young-Su Lee.
