25|$|John Brown's Raid on Harpers Ferry sent a {{shock wave}} across the South. When the Thirty-sixth Congress met in December 1859 {{the first order}} of {{business}} was the selection of a speaker. Already in turmoil over the Brown raid, Southerners were further aggravated by the nomination of Ohio Republican John Sherman for the post. Sherman was one of 68 Republicans who had endorsed Hinton Helper’s book, The Impending Crisis and <b>How</b> <b>to</b> <b>Meet</b> It, which Southerners believed would ignite class warfare between slaveholders and non-slaveholders in the South. Republicans proposed buying 100,000 copies of the book and distributing it throughout the country. Miles conspired with South Carolina's governor to send a regiment of militia to Washington to break up the Congress in the event of Sherman's election, but the withdrawal of Sherman's nomination prevented action.|$|E
