500|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{nuisance}} claims; in Nichols v Marsland, for example, [...] "Act of God" [...] {{was accepted as}} a defence. One defence is that of [...] "20 years prescription", which is valid for private nuisance but not public. If a private nuisance continues for 20 years, it becomes legal by prescription, assuming the defendant can show {{that it has been}} continuous and the claimant has been aware of it. A limitation is that the 20 years is from when the activity became a nuisance, not from when the activity started. In Sturges v Bridgman, the claimant, a doctor, lived next to a [...] "confectionery business". Vibrations and noises coming from this business continued for over 20 years without causing the doctor nuisance, and the doctor only complained after building a consulting room in his garden. It was held that the actual nuisance only started when the consulting room was built and the activity began to affect the doctor, not when the activity started. A second defence is statutory authority, when an activity is authorised by a piece of legislation; this applies to both public and private nuisance. This applies even when the activity is carried out not directly in line with the statute, but <b>intra</b> <b>vires.</b> In Allen v Gulf Oil Refining Ltd, the defendant was authorised to build an oil refinery by an Act of Parliament. The Act gave no express authority to operate it, and after it came into operation the claimant argued that it caused a nuisance through the smell and noise. The House of Lords held that it had statutory authority to operate the refinery, saying [...] "Parliament can hardly be supposed to have intended the refinery to be nothing more than a visual adornment to the landscape in an area of natural beauty". The statutory authority defence has recently been subject to legislative consideration in the Planning Act 2008, which expands the defence to over 14 types of infrastructure development.|$|E

5000|$|Ultra vires is a Latin phrase meaning [...] "beyond the powers". If an act {{requires}} {{legal authority}} {{and it is}} done with such authority, it is characterised in law as <b>intra</b> <b>vires</b> ("within the powers").

50|$|In 1880, the Supreme Court of Canada {{decision}} in The Queen v Fredericton (Mayor) had {{held that the}} law was <b>intra</b> <b>vires</b> under the trade and commerce clause. That decision was not appealed to the Privy Council.|$|E

50|$|The {{constitutional}} question {{put before}} the Court {{was whether the}} Act infringed the right to freedom of conscience and religion, if so, whether it is justified under section 1 of the Charter, and whether the Act was <b>intra</b> <b>vires</b> (within) Parliament's criminal power under section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867.|$|E
5000|$|... the {{prohibition}} of importation of the goods mentioned in the section is <b>intra</b> <b>vires</b> of Parliament as legislation in relation to foreign trade (Locke J dissented, maintaining that the entire section was ultra vires while expressing no opinion as {{to the power of}} Parliament to ban importation by appropriate legislation).|$|E
50|$|The judge held that, {{even on the}} {{assumption}} that the sale of YMS Ltd had been at an undervalue, it was a genuine sale, not ultra vires and not an unauthorised distribution of Progress' assets.

50|$|The {{issue was}} whether the Quebec Agricultural Marketing Board, a board created by the province, was ultra vires the {{authority}} of the province.

The Court found that the pith and substance of the Board was related to contractual rights which is valid provincial subject matter.|$|E
5000|$|The High Court {{overturned}} the validation order, {{on the basis}} that to validate was against public policy. Heron J stated [...] "I think here there is considerable force in counsel's submission that where one is considering ultra vires conduct in respect of a statutory body such as a local body under the Local Government Act and not just an unlawful activity otherwise <b>intra</b> <b>vires,</b> wide considerations of public interest apply".|$|E
5000|$|Controlled activities, {{set out in}} {{sections}} 10 to 12 of the Act, are AHR activities permitted if performed in accordance with regulations and by a licensed clinic or individual in licensed premises. However, section 10, which addressed the [...] "use of human reproductive material," [...] and section 11, which addressed [...] "transgenics," [...] were ruled ultra vires. Section 12, which addresses the [...] "reimbursement of expenditures" [...] for providing gametes and surrogacy services, is <b>intra</b> <b>vires</b> but is not yet in force.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{regulatory}} scheme is declared valid, the court must then {{determine whether the}} impugned provision is sufficiently integrated with the scheme {{that it can be}} upheld by virtue of that relationship. This requires considering the seriousness of the encroachment on provincial powers, in order to decide on the proper standard for such a relationship. If the provision passes this integration test, it is <b>intra</b> <b>vires</b> Parliament as an exercise of the general trade and commerce power. If the provision is not sufficiently integrated into the scheme of regulation, it cannot be sustained under the second branch of s. 91(2).|$|E
50|$|The British North America Act, 1867, which {{established}} a federal constitution for Canada, enumerated in Sections 91 and 92 the topics {{on which the}} Dominion and the Provinces could respectively legislate. Notwithstanding that the lists were framed {{so as to be}} fairly full and comprehensive, soon, {{it was found that the}} topics enumerated in the two sections overlapped, and the Privy Council repeatedly had to pass on the constitutionality of laws made by the federal and provincial legislatures. It was in this situation that the Privy Council evolved the doctrine, that for deciding whether an impugned legislation was <b>intra</b> <b>vires,</b> regard must be had to its pith and substance.|$|E
50|$|In Canadian Constitutional law, interjurisdictional {{immunity}} is {{the legal}} doctrine that determines which legislation arising from one level of jurisdiction may be applicable to matters covered at another level. Interjurisdictional immunity is {{an exception to the}} pith and substance doctrine, as it stipulates that there is a core to each federal subject matter that cannot be reached by provincial laws. While a provincial law that imposes a tax on banks may be ruled <b>intra</b> <b>vires,</b> as it is not within the protected core of banking, a provincial law that limits the rights of creditors to enforce their debts would strike at such a core and be ruled inapplicable.|$|E
50|$|Thus, if {{a statute}} {{is found in}} {{substance}} to relate to a topic within the competence of the legislature, it should be held to be <b>intra</b> <b>vires</b> even though it might incidentally trench on topics not within its legislative competence. The extent of the encroachment on matters beyond its competence may be an element in determining whether the legislation is colourable: whether {{in the guise of}} making a law on a matter within its competence, the legislature is, in truth, making a law on a subject beyond its competence. However, where that is not the position, the fact of encroachment does not affect the vires of the law even as regards the area of encroachment.|$|E
5000|$|The Duomatic {{principle}} is {{a principle of}} English company law relating to the informal approval of actions by a companys shareholders (and, potentially, directors). [...] The {{principle is}} named after the decision {{in which it was}} first recognised: Re Duomatic Ltd 1969 2 Ch 365, although in that case Buckley J was approving an older statement of the law from the decisions in In re Express Engineering 1920 1 Ch 466 and Parker and Cooper Ltd v Reading 1926 Ch 975. It origins lie in the obiter dictum comments of Lord Davey in Salomon v Salomon & Co Ltd where he stated that the company is bound in a matter <b>intra</b> <b>vires</b> by the unanimous agreement of its members.|$|E
