40|$|Inflation {{has been}} low when {{productivity}} {{growth has been}} high. This occurs because the Federal Reserve has not adjusted nominal income growth in response to changes in productivity growth, implying that an acceleration in trend productivity growth leads to a <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> <b>inflation.</b> The model's predictions are confirmed: (1) Inflation should fall when trend productivity growth rises, and (2) nominal income and wage growth should not change with trend productivity. The model also implies that productivity growth enters a Phillips curve relationship {{as a proxy for}} inflation expectations. Thus, estimates of the NAIRU should fall when productivity growth accelerates. (JEL E 31, E 50, E 52) Copyright 2003, Oxford University Press. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the years}} before the global {{financial}} crisis of 2008 [...] 2010, Qatar experienced a huge build-up of liquidity surplus in the banking system, mainly driven by surging net capital inflows. This paper identifies various sources of interbank liquidity in Qatar and discusses the various implications of structural primary liquidity surplus for the money market in particular and the economy at large. The paper attempts to evaluate the Qatar Central Bank policy making and conduct during the pre- and post-crisis periods within a framework of the Austrian monetary overinvestment theories, and concludes that the central bank had forcibly committed several forced monetary policy mistakes, {{which resulted in a}} breakdown in the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. This led to the inability of the central bank to control the interbank interest rate and to an accelerating inflation rate during the pre-crisis years. In contrast, a dramatic change in the central bank's monetary policy framework and a deliberate monetary policy mistake on behalf of the central bank resulted in a restoration of the interest rate channel of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, stabilization of the interbank interest rate close to the central bank's policy rate and a sharp <b>deceleration</b> <b>in</b> the <b>inflation</b> rate <b>in</b> the post-crisis period. The paper concludes by offering brief policy recommendations. ...|$|R
40|$|Austria's {{economy is}} {{projected}} to grow by 2. 4 percent in volume in 2006. The cyclical recovery will be sustained by exports. The manufacturing sector will largely benefit from the front-loading of purchases of durable consumer goods, notably motor cars, in Germany ahead of the VAT increase as from 1 January 2007. Results from the regular WIFO business survey suggest that improved sales prospects will induce companies to carry out new investment projects. Private household demand, for its part, will only gradually overcome its sluggishness caused by wage moderation and a rising saving ratio. The <b>deceleration</b> of <b>inflation</b> <b>in</b> 2006 will leave scope for limited gains in real income.

40|$|For {{the next}} twelve months or so, the Austrian economy is {{expected}} to stay on a modest growth track of 2 percent annual rate. A significant acceleration in 1993 over 1992, as assumed in earlier forecasts, is now considered unlikely. Sluggishness abroad and currency devaluations of major trading partners weaken the outlook for Austrian exports {{as well as for}} tourism demand. Merchandise exports are unlikely to rise by more than 3 percent p. a. implying slight losses of market shares; expected volume gains of 1 percent in tourism exports are much smaller than those registered over the last years. Domestic demand will continue to provide firm support to activity. With an estimated increase of 2 ½ percent in 1993 consumption may again outpace private disposable incomes. The effective revaluation of the schilling will keep down import prices and thus facilitate further <b>deceleration</b> of <b>inflation.</b> <b>In</b> 1993, the effects of the higher mineral oil tax and of other price hikes will have passed through and the annual rate may subside from 4 percent to 3 ½ percent or less. With no major shifts in the demand components to be expected the current account should stay in small surplus. Prognose für 1992 und 1993.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} two-way {{interactions between}} structural reform and macro policy. If structural reforms increase {{the flexibility of}} labor markets, {{they are likely to}} improve the short-run inflation-unemployment tradeoff, providing an incentive for policymakers to expand aggregate demand. Also, policymakers' promises that they will encourage a decline in unemployment in response to good news on inflation can be used to strike a political deal with interests opposed to the introduction or extension of structural reform. Expansionary monetary policy also gives relief on the fiscal front by bringing the actual budget deficit closer to the structural budget deficit, and indirectly, by encouraging structural reform, potentially reducing the structural budget deficit itself. In 1992 - 93 several European countries dropped out of the ERM to pursue more expansionary monetary policies. The difference in the results of these countries and those countries which maintained a peg between their currencies and the Deutschemark provides a test case of the consequences of expansionary monetary policy. The depreciating nations by 1995 enjoyed a relative acceleration of nominal GDP and an even greater deceleration of inflation, so that their growth rate of real GDP accelerated more than their growth rate of nominal GDP in relation to the pegging countries. The continued <b>deceleration</b> of <b>inflation</b> <b>in</b> the depreciating countries provides evidence that their natural unemployment rate has declined and that expansionary monetary policy has interacted beneficially with structural reform. ...|$|R

The main objective of the paper is to investigate why the quest for a growth takeoff has been more elusive in the WAEMU countries compared to other SSA countries. To do this, the paper focuses on the determinants of growth accelerations and <b>decelerations</b> <b>in</b> SSA and the WAEMU. It finds that the variables most closely associated with growth accelerations and <b>decelerations</b> <b>in</b> SSA are changes in terms of trade, private investment, civil tension, real exchange rates, and inflation.
