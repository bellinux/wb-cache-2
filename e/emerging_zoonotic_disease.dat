However, the vaccine was shown to be unstable at room temperature and at 37 °C in both lyophilized and liquid forms.

40|$|Anaplasma phagocytophilum is a {{zoonotic}} obligate intracellular bacterium {{known to}} be transmitted by ticks belonging to the Ixodes persulcatus complex. This bacterium can infect several mammalian species, and is known to cause diseases with variable symptoms in many domestic animals. Specifically, it is the causative agent of tick-borne fever, a disease of important economic impact in European domestic ruminants, and human granulocytic anaplasmosis, an <b>emerging</b> <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> in both the USA and Europe. A. phagocytophilum epidemiological cycles are complex and involve different ecotypes, vectors, and mammalian host species.

Methods: A questionnaire was administered to 53 state <b>zoonotic</b> <b>disease</b> program representatives in the United States and Puerto Rico.

A Model <b>Zoonotic</b> <b>Disease</b> program was developed to help guide local public health on developing local biosurveillance programs. Results: One or more representatives from total of 36 / 53 (68 %) states and Puerto Rico responded to the survey.
