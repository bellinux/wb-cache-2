5|$|Soon after launch night, NBN {{extended}} {{television coverage}} from Bungwahl to Broken Bay {{and as far}} west as Aberdeen. The station only operated eight hours per day, however several programs were produced locally including Home at Three, Let's Cook With Gas, Tempo, <b>Focus,</b> <b>as</b> well as nightly news bulletins at 6.30pm.|$|E
5|$|Because The Birth of a Nation {{attracted}} increased scrutiny due {{to possible}} Oscar nominations, {{and the film}} itself depicts a brutal rape, there was significant press coverage about damage control by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the studio releasing the film. Interviews in Variety and Deadline were a <b>focus,</b> <b>as</b> was Parker's response to the event in a Facebook post.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of development, Soma Bringer {{was to be a}} standard role-playing game. During early testing, it was seen that typical role-playing games were not well suited to the DS' limited hardware and controls, so they adjusted the gameplay to its current form as an action role-playing game. After positive feedback from this, the team went ahead. The move to being an action role-playing game enabled the incorporation of cooperative multiplayer: the team wanted to <b>focus</b> <b>as</b> much as possible on the combat and related gimmicks over environmental puzzles. Rather than a separate mode, multiplayer was incorporated into the main story. The development cycle differed greatly from previous Monolith Soft titles. In Takahashi's earlier games, the scenario was written first then the gameplay was tailored to fit. For Soma Bringer, the gameplay was finalized first, and the scenario was built around the locations, dungeons, and mechanics the team had created. Also in contrast to earlier Monolith Soft titles was the lack of lengthy cutscenes, which could not be incorporated into the game with the DS' limited hardware. Instead, the team used the real-time graphics and gameplay models for equivalent scenes.|$|E

5|$|The party infiltrates Cocoon {{and heads}} towards Orphan but soon {{discover}} that the Cavalry have been turned into Cie'th. The party defeats Barthandelus, but Orphan awakens and merges with Barthandelus, then compels Fang to finish her <b>Focus</b> <b>as</b> Ragnarok while the others are seemingly transformed into Cie'th. The party reappears in human form, preventing Fang from transforming. The party defeats Orphan and escapes Cocoon, which is now falling towards Pulse. As {{the rest of the}} party turns to crystal for completing their Focus, Vanille and Fang remain on Cocoon and transform into Ragnarok together to prevent a collision between Cocoon and Pulse. The rest of the party awaken from their crystallization on Pulse and find their l'Cie brands gone; Lightning, Hope, Snow and Sazh reunite with Serah and Dajh.|$|E
5|$|When Ronald Reagan's {{administration}} {{took power}} in 1981, the export restrictions {{put in place}} by the Carter administration were slowly relaxed. At first, the FX program continued as normal, but a number of events eroded the value of the program and limit the F-5G's potential sales. The signing of the 1982 US-PRC Joint Communiqué was a major agreement on arms sales, which continued blocking sales of the F-5G to Taiwan. By this point the Taiwanese had started their own light-fighter project, the AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo. In signing the Communiqué, the U.S. was signaling that Taiwan would not receive modern aircraft, therefore the Ching-kuo became Taiwan's primary <b>focus.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the F-5G's sales potential remained unestablished.|$|E
25|$|The target {{audience}} {{of the channel}} is made of viewers from 14 to 44 years old, but actually its core is mostly youngsters, of 18 to 30 years old. The channel has an entertaining <b>focus,</b> <b>as</b> it specializes mostly on TV shows and comedy series.|$|E

25|$|Oaths, secret {{signs and}} knowledge, and regalia were {{historically}} {{an important part}} of many benefit societies, but declined in use in most benefit societies during {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries.

25|$|Stephen J. Hunt {{described}} Rawat's major <b>focus</b> <b>as</b> {{being on}} stillness, peace and contentment within the individual, with his 'Knowledge' {{consisting of the}} techniques to obtain these. According to Hunt, in Rawat's case the notion of spiritual growth is not derived — as is traditionally the case with other gurus — from his personal charisma, but from {{the nature of his}} teachings and the benefits to the individuals applying them.|$|E
25|$|Latifa Elnadi {{was born}} on 29 October 1907 into middle-class family of Cairo.

Her father, who worked for the government printing office, Matbaa Amiriya, saw no reason for ElNadi to pursue secondary education.

The industry's goal is topping NZ $2 billion and becoming a top 5 export industry. The report also showcased the industry's growing emphasis on sustainability. Sustainability and organic programs certify around 95% of NZ's vineyard producing area. Social sustainability is as large a <b>focus</b> <b>as</b> environmental, the report said.|$|E
25|$|The {{quadriceps}} tendon, while historically {{reserved for}} revision reconstructions, {{has enjoyed a}} renewed <b>focus</b> <b>as</b> a versatile and durable graft for primary reconstructions. Use of the quadriceps tendon usually does not result in {{the same degree of}} anterior knee pain postoperatively, and quadriceps tendon harvest produces a reliably thick, robust graft. The quadriceps tendon has approximately 20% greater collagen per cross-sectional area than the patellar tendon, and a greater diameter of usable soft tissue is available.|$|E
25|$|Multiplayer {{gameplay}} {{also makes}} a return in Revelations. The mode expands the basics of online modes from Brotherhood with new characters and locations. Players are able to customize their characters' appearance. Matchmaking and game interface are also improved. Ubisoft says that although this component is returning, the narrative, which is considered {{more important to the}} franchise, is an area of greater <b>focus.</b> <b>As</b> players level up in the multiplayer game, they move up in their Abstergo Templar rank and gain access to more information about the company.|$|E

25|$|Olivia's {{perspectives}} and inner feelings very often {{serve as the}} focal points for episodes of the series that directly focus on her development {{as a human being}} {{and a member of the}} law enforcement community. Critically acclaimed for an evolving storyline, Olivia has highlighted determination and <b>focus</b> <b>as</b> her main traits, according to Abrams. Following a plot line in the second season, viewers are introduced to Olivia's doppelgänger from the parallel universe, which develops an alternate reality for each character. Torv has received several awards for her portrayal of Olivia.|$|E
25|$|In {{its final}} years, ASOPA {{introduced}} training for secondary teachers and more specialised administration courses. In 1970 {{there was a}} major change of <b>focus</b> <b>as,</b> with Papua New Guinea independence looming, the Australian Government turned to ASOPA to make good a serious shortage of trained indigenous administrators. The School enrolled up to 60 Papua New Guineans in ten-month management training courses. At the same time, the training of Australians was phased out. In these later years, ASOPA's work became more international. Although Papua New Guinea remained strongly represented, increasing numbers of students came from other developing countries in the Pacific and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|True to its roots, Elk Island National Park still {{maintains}} a thriving elk population, estimated at 605 in 2007, {{as well as}} around 300 moose and over 500 deer. Parks Canada transferred eighteen western moose from Elk Island to Nova Scotia's Cape Breton Highlands National Park between 1947 and 1949. Reintroduction of traditional species {{has been an important}} <b>focus</b> <b>as</b> well. Besides the success of the wood and plains bison introduction, beaver were reintroduced in 1942, and in 2007 numbered near 1000. 1987 saw the beginning of a Trumpeter Swan reintroduction programme which is now seeing mating pairs returning to Elk Island, raising hope for a sustainable population.|$|E
