5|$|During the 2014–15 season, {{a dismal}} run of form saw the team slip {{to the bottom}} of the league table with only 19 points from 29 matches. By 3 April 2015, they were seven points adrift from safety. This could <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> sudden end to Leicester's seven-year rise, but seven wins from their final nine league matches meant the Foxes {{finished}} the season in 14th place with 41 points. They finished the season with a 5–1 thrashing of relegated Queens Park Rangers. Their upturn in results was described as one of the Premier League's greatest ever escapes from relegation. They also became only the third team in Premier League history to survive after being bottom at Christmas (the other two being West Bromwich Albion in 2005 and Sunderland in 2014), and no team with fewer than 20 points from 29 matches had previously stayed up.|$|E

25|$|Protective {{measures}} such as respirators <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> steady decline in death rates due to silicosis in Western countries. However, {{this is not true}} of less developed countries where work conditions are poor and respiratory equipment is seldom used. For instance, life expectancy for silver miners in Potosí, Bolivia is around 40 years due to silicosis.|$|E
25|$|Centuries of {{development}} <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> mix of architectural styles to Penang, both historical and modern. The centre of George Town has been inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site {{due to its}} unique architectural and cultural townscape without parallel anywhere in East and Southeast Asia.

The oldest {{portion of the}} city centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, while outside the UNESCO zone lies the modern cityscape, with skyscrapers, residential high-rises, office blocks and shopping malls built all over the city. In particular, the older architecture reflects the legacy of 171 years of British presence on Penang Island, coalescing Malay, Chinese, Indian, Peranakan, Siamese, Burmese, British and other cultural influences.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of The Big Time Fanny alienated the public, lost her {{contract}} with the BBC and became fair game for harsh criticism by the media, which revealed that she and Major Cradock were not married. An entry in the Dictionary of National Biography suggested that she embellished her surname as Primrose-Pechey, when it derived from her paternal grandfather John Thomas Primrose Pechey. Subsequent celebrity chefs <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> sophistication to British cooking which was {{not a part of}} Fanny's repertoire, but have acknowledged her pioneering work, when purple piped potato brought excitement to a Britain of liver and bacon suppers.|$|E
25|$|Francis Billingsley {{seems to}} <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> measure of professionalism to the defence of Bridgnorth. Wolryche, however, seems {{never to have}} fully {{reconciled}} himself {{to the demands of}} war. In June he wrote to Capell to denounce a constable of Halesowen, then in Shropshire, who had been insufficiently vigorous in levying taxation, requisitioning and conscripting for the king. Nevertheless, when a relative, Gilbert Warley, protested to him about the exactions of a royalist foraging party on his neighbours, Wolryche was quick to write to Ottley, asking for his help in recovering horses stolen in the incident.|$|E

25|$|The 21st {{century has}} {{witnessed}} a vigorous {{revival of the}} idea of human nature in the hands of authors like Edward Wilson, Steven Pinker and Jesús Mosterín. The successful sequencing of the human genome and the ongoing research on the function of genes and of regulatory sequences, together with the insights on the workings of the brain, <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> new actuality and significance to this classical notion. According to Mosterín, the nature of our species Homo sapiens is the information genetically transmitted and present in the human genome (in the genetic pool). Your individual nature lies in your own genome, present in the chromosomes of your cells. The human genome has a layered structure and (up to a point) recapitulates the history of our human lineage. The oldest and deepest strata of our nature represent the living functions common to all life on Earth. Subsequent strata reflect later novelties. The newest layers are devoted to the most recent acquisitions, like bipedalism, grip of precision, large brain cortex, language and other abstract or recursive cognitive processes. Mosterín has dealt with the methods and criteria for distinguishing natural from cultural aspects of human capacities and behaviors and has provided a solid basis to theoretical anthropology. He has also engaged in the discussion and clarification of bioethical issues, like research with embryonic stem cells, birth control, abortion and euthanasia, taking always a scientific point of view and a position in favor of human freedom.|$|E

500|$|By 200 BCE, the Basketmaker culture {{had begun}} to develop from the Oshara Tradition. At least two groups of {{transitional}} Basketmaker II people inhabited the San Juan Basin during this period, as increased rainfall allowed for sustained agriculture and permanent settlements by 1 CE, when the water table rose and intermittent streams became more reliable. During the first four centuries CE, the Basketmaker II people established pit-houses at elevated locations near sources of water and arable land. Brian M. Fagan notes {{that the development of}} pottery in the area during the 4th century permitted the boiling of maize and beans for the first time, and [...] "must <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> revolution in cooking". This period also marked the introduction of the bow and arrow to the region.|$|E

500|$|Video game {{publications}} and developers praised Super Mario 64 for its design {{and use of}} the 3D gameplay. The game is counted by 1UP.com {{as one of the first}} games to <b>have</b> <b>brought</b> <b>a</b> series of 2D games into full 3D. Maximum commented that [...] "The old 2D platform genre is essentially dead with the arrival of this game. The limitations inherent with the genre have been swept away in the wake of Mario 64." [...] In the transition to 3D, many of the series conventions were rethought drastically, placing an emphasis on exploration over traditional platform jumping, or [...] "hop and bop" [...] action. While its quality was disputed by some, it has been argued that it established an entirely new genre, different from that of previous games in the series. Time Magazine focused on the realistic kinetic animation and the controls provided by the integration of the new pressure-sensitive controller into the game, calling it the [...] "fastest, smoothest game action yet attainable via joystick at the service of equally virtuoso motion", where [...] "or once, the movement on the screen feels real".|$|E
