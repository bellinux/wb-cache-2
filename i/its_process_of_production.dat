Archaeological evidence {{of cast iron}} appears in 5th century BC China. New methods of producing it by carburizing bars of iron in the cementation process were devised in the 17th century. During the Industrial Revolution, new methods of producing bar iron without charcoal were devised and these were later applied to produce steel, creating {{a new era of}} greatly increased use of iron and steel that some contemporaries described as a new Iron Age. In the late 1850s, Henry Bessemer invented a new steelmaking process, that involved blowing air through molten pig iron to burn off carbon, and so to produce mild steel. [...] This and other 19th-century and later processes have displaced the use of wrought iron. Today, wrought iron is no longer produced on a commercial scale.|$|E

40|$|The {{shifts in}} the {{priorities}} of literary and cultural theory and criticism were already underway in the South African academy {{by the end of}} the 1980 s, with the gathering momentum of the mass political movement reaching its apotheosis with the release of Nelson Mandela from prison in 1990. Whereas creative literary and cultural expression has often lagged behind advances in theory, there was nevertheless a steady acknowledgement of the necessity for a corresponding shift in the discursive character of the creative arts, even if the material conditions on the ground remained largely unchanged. Ramadan Suleman’s film Fools, which appeared in 1997 as an adaptation of Njabulo Ndebele’s 1983 novella by the same title, entered the fray with its argument for a new or, as it were, broader consciousness of the deeper, more complex legacy of ‘sexual violence’. This legacy included the weak ‘place of women in the everyday life of the township’ (Suleman 1995 : 1), and indeed in the very idea of ‘the everyday’ that some in literary and cultural circles sought to inscribe. This article provides an assessment of the nature and extent of the film’s intervention in the context of the systematic breakdown of the old certainties of race, identity and nation post-apartheid, together with the literary-critical cultures and apparatuses that presided over their coherences and raptures. I take as my starting point Robert Stam and Louise Spence’s (1983 : 3) assertion that ‘[a]though […] those questions bearing on the cinematic industry, <b>its</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> distribution and exhibition’ – in short, questions bearing on ‘the contextual’ – are of ‘crucial importance’, they need to be tempered with those bearing on the ‘textual and intertextual’ (emphasis in original).

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. October 2013. Major: Comparative Literature. Advisor: Cesare Casarino. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); v, 260 pages. In this dissertation, I {{claim that the}} figure of the scientific laboratory in literature serves as a means for the literary text to reflect upon its own conditions <b>of</b> possibility, <b>its</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> and <b>its</b> socio-cultural functions, all of which enact an autocritique of literature by literature. In representing production within the scientific laboratory, Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (chapter one) and H. G. Wells' Island of Dr. Moreau (chapter two) demonstrate how this space of scientific labor is a model for the space <b>of</b> literary <b>production.</b> Following out the claim that an isomorphism exists between these two spaces, I offer new insights into the <b>processes</b> and effects <b>of</b> literary inscription. With this focus on literary production, I read these literary texts {{from the perspective of the}} material and affective processes that constitute a literary object rather than from a point of view on the finalized product alone. I argue that the novel itself becomes a laboratory, a space of experimentation in and through which one enacts and reenacts the myriad living processes associated with literary discourse. In my third chapter, I further elaborate this perspective through a reading of bodies and social groups in Octavia Butler's Xenogenesis trilogy that take on the qualities of scientific or literary laboratories, and often both at once. I specifically pay attention to Butler's use of genetics and genetic engineering in both the content and formal characteristics of her novels. Here, I take the laboratory as a concept for thinking through both literary labor, as well as the function of speculative fictions and utopian thought in the biotech industry and the life sciences. Finally, my fourth and final chapter considers the function of the laboratory as a social apparatus for the <b>production</b> <b>of</b> discourse on life in Ridley Scott's film Prometheus. As in the previous chapters, the laboratory is here a site in and through which the work's conditions of possibility are made visible, enabling the film to critique the roles of marketing and finance in contemporary laboratory practices that come to blur the line between the fictional and the scientific in the era of biocapital...|$|R

The {{pleasure of}} the text, for Barthes, takes the form of drift and this surfaces in a number of his writings, as a means of remaining mobile, detached, capable of ‘contemplative duration’. The paper considers Barthes’ paintings and drawings in these terms, and explores their qualities of graphism, colour and spatial construction with reference to works by other thinkers on these subject, in particular Hubert Damisch’s Theory of /Cloud/...|$|E

Therefore, there was an increase in the cultivated area for this sort of consumption, just like it had happened to green maize some decades before. Different types of maize cultivars – sweet corn, popcorn and regular maize - have been used to produce baby corn although its cultivation is not really expressive and lacks agro-industrial technology and techniques, compared to other countries. Furthermore, little is known about <b>its</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and performance. The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of maize cultivars in different sowing periods and plant detasseling performance on baby corn production. Experiments were carried out at the Brazilian Maize and Sorghum Research Center (EMBRAPA), Sete Lagoas, MG, Brazil, from 1999 till 2001. Trials were planted on December 23, 1999, January 20, 2000, October 12, 2000 and February 02, 2001. The experimental design was a randomized block with 8 x 2 factorial scheme (8 maize cultivars, with and without detasseling), with three replications. Three baby corn harvests were performed every three days being the first 3 days after style-stigma emission (65 days after sowing). Agronomic characteristics such as the husked ears weight, the baby corn weight and the baby corn yield were evaluated.

40|$|Hand {{and machine}} are {{the means of}} {{bringing}} {{the design of a}} building into reality. Many {{attempts have been made to}} integrate their application in the process of construction without definitive result. Contemporary buildings are brought into existence in a more or less intuitive selection of the processes, usually based on imitating successful experiences rather than initiating them. ^ The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the expressions resulting from hand and machine on artifacts and our attitude towards these expressions. This study demonstrates that the existing ad hoc combination of hand and machine processes is due to a misunderstanding of the essence of these processes, a change in their application to architectural practice, and a misinformation about their origins that led to an increase in the materialization of certain misconceptions and distancing from certain realities. To master hand and machine craftsmanship is to understand building materials, processes of production, and the nature of workmanship [...] their extent and limits, their applications and implications, and their meaning and representation. ^ Five single family, fully detached houses designed by architects are explored: the Gamble, Robie, Esherick, Farnsworth, and Eames houses. These are positioned on a scale of workmanship from total hand to total machine production. Each building is examined as a text based on the fact that the artifact reflects the characteristics of <b>its</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> thus accepting the idea that the visual logic of the building is related to its construction logic. This concept is researched through the explanation, evaluation, and expression of building materials, processes of production, and nature of workmanship. ^ One approach towards bringing a balance to the process of building is the building of architectural cyborgs [...] buildings put together through hand and machine craftsmanship. This is achieved through a synthesis of their application that is based on an understanding of the triadic relation created between materials, processes, and workmanship, as applied within a given context. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on {{fieldwork}} conducted in Seattle, U. S. A., mainly amongst the buzz of electric needles {{and the smell of}} green soap in a selection of local tattoo shops. Tattooing and tattoos in modern day Seattle are created and enacted in a complex and contested matrix of motivations and interpretations that refer to the western tattoo's specific history as a mark of enforced or self-inscribed marginality, to other tattoo practices and discourses around the world, and to the relation between the tattoo itself as a material object and <b>its</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> which has certain technical elements in common wherever it is performed. The meaning accorded to the tattoo process and the finished tattoo differ widely in different contexts, but the technical commonalties mean that local variations are variations over a technical theme, a theme that makes tattooing a particularly loaded and intense mode of metaphorical expression. Two recent processes of change {{play a key role in}} both local Seattle and wider western uses and interpretations of tattooing and the tattoo. One is a significant increase in the number of people getting tattooed and getting into tattooing as a profession, and a marked process of diversification and differentiation among both groups. The other is a combination of technological improvements and a growing focus on the aesthetic and spiritual aspects and potential of tattooing and tattoos, and on the collaboration between the tattooist and the individual client on the creation of unique, customised designs. Through investigating different ways in which tattoo practices and discourses are enacted, articulated, negotiated and contested by local tattooists, tattooees and untattooed 'audiences', I attempt to explore and make a case for the ambiguity and complexity of the tattoo as a mark and tattooing as a practice, and argue that the tattoo's potency and potential is intimately linked to this ambiguity. On a more general level this paper is also about the multiple and mutually influential relations between structural changes and individually lived lives, the dialectical relationship between power and resistance, and differing conceptions of the relationship between appearance and essence...|$|E

O discurso da notícia exerce na sociedade uma função manipuladora, porque é produzido por uma organização que detém uma forma específica de comunicação pública que reproduz para a sociedade aquilo que é de seu interesse e assim direciona o leitor para determinada compreensão desse discurso e, assim, se concretiza a manipulação, que provoca a hegemonia ou a mudança social.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the dual aesthetics of procedurality and narrativity in interactive documentaries. Arguing against Lev Manovich’s notion that database as symbolic form precludes narrative (1998), the paper explores the particularities of the interface {{and the structure}} of story elements in interactive documentaries. Digital hybrid objects such as interactive documentaries embed within their aesthetic and interactional construction many forms of aesthetic, cultural, and narrativized organizations and influences that a medium-centric understanding of digital media fails to capture. The paper focuses on an analysis of Jonathan Harris’s “I Love Your Work” (2013), asking the question: what kind of stories does Harris’s experimentation produce? The work relies on a procedural logic in <b>its</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> (Harris took ten seconds of video every five minutes for ten days). There is also an aesthetics of procedurality and seriality evident in its interface aesthetics, which Harris calls a “tapestry,” that structures the documentary in 10 second increments available to the viewer through the online interface. The paper argues that the database as structure and procedurality as aesthetic process do not preclude narrative arcs with beginnings and ends; these arcs just look different. "I Love Your Work" and similar projects challenge the simplification of database structures as minimizing story, calling us to include in our analyses interface design, computational algorithms, and multimodality as part of narrative structures and paratexts. I argue—analogously to the classic statement in computer science: algorithms + data structures equals programs (Wirth 1975) —that procedural digital interfaces that rely on database structures, recombinatory interactive choices for the reader, and minimal narrative units can create serial narratives. Building on Brian McHale’s spectrum of narrativity with oscillating states between “trip” and “mission” (2011), I suggest that the trajectories of procedural watching that occur in “I Love Your Work” produce weak narratives that invoke the episodic and the picaresque. The interactive documentary thus serves {{as an example of how}} various instances of narrativity occur in digital forms and the paper shows how the confluence of reactive interfaces and malleable computational media along with shifting reader and author positions generate potentialities for the documentary form along a spectrum of weak and strong narrativity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the way in}} which imponderable problems are mediated in the everyday work <b>of</b> commercial film <b>production</b> in Egypt. By 'imponderable problem', I mean a working problem encountered in an extended production process whereby the individual worker, in the present, cannot account for all courses of action leading onto the processâs expected outcome. I argue that workers in film production can never entirely solve this kind of problem: they 'mediate' it. They rely on various assumptions and material mediators to break this overall imponderability into a series of contingent tasks, thereby modifying the expected outcome. I situate this mediation in the wider context of the contemporary Egyptian film industry, with its interpersonal mode of interaction, its labor hierarchy, <b>its</b> socio-technical <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>production,</b> and <b>its</b> technological implements. This thesis analyzes three imponderable problems in particular: how to coordinate a shooting day; how to visualize the film; and how to anticipate the audience's composition and reaction. The overall argument is situated within media anthropology, where media production tends to be examined as a 'social' phenomenon inscribed on an invisible technological substratum, without exploring the material implications of everyday technological objects in a temporally extended <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>production.</b> This literature, moreover, tends to be inattentive to the gap between {{the way in which}} the film unfolds and the way in which social agents involved in its making anticipate this unfolding. This thesis, by contrast, considers how Egyptian filmmakers try to anticipate the future of their activity. In addition to being an ethnographic account of the Egyptian film industry, this thesis contributes to the anthropological literature on media production by exploring how workers concretely mediate between the present and the near-/far-future. </p...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{a contribution}} to a theory of ludocapitalism, understood as the incorporation {{of the concept of}} game-playing into capitalism in contemporary technoculture. The term is derived from the Latin word ludus, meaning game or play. By this compound term, I mean to describe a hybrid or transitional moment of capitalism that describes <b>its</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> commodity <b>production</b> and capital accumulation through reference to play as a central concept of human activity and social organization, superseding the concept of work as the locus of rationality in traditional capitalist labor formations. Through a (post) humanistic study of the discourses and practices of software and game development viewed as paradigmatic instantiations of conditions of ludocapitalism, I develop an approach to engage these practices in ethical-political discourse derived from the critical theory tradition. In this dissertation, I relate this dialectic of play to classical discourses of modernity in order to draw comparisons, contrasts and historical transitions from the liberal human subject of the Enlightenment to a technoliberal, posthuman subject prompted by the computerization of society and the expansion of digital play. A central question of this dissertation is whether and in what modified form traditional discourses of critical theory can maintain relevance in this techno-ludic context. Through an analysis of the ambiguity of play and creativity in discourses of game design and software development, and as a complement to textual and rhetorical theories of digital media, I advance a critical approach to digital game and software studies, attentive to the ambivalent potential of specific technical-social platforms upon which these new forms of media are constructed, with an aim to advance and reconfigure the conditions of ludocapitalist society toward better sustaining our collective forms of life...|$|R
40|$|So far the filmic {{dialogue}} and its translation have been researched {{mainly from the}} perspective of the translator of the script, this approach being justified by the claim that the translator cannot manipulate any other but the verbal code. The nature of the audiovisual text, whether in its original or dubbed version, is, nevertheless, explicitly multimodal, and its complex meaning is coded on multiple level via diverse means. An important factor which makes audiovisual research complicated is the fact that the audiovisual text is essentially a teamwork determined by collaboration of many different people in different stages <b>of</b> its <b>production.</b> This thesis attempts to approach the audiovisual text of as a whole, that is, in the form it is presented to the audience. The opening part identifies the specifities of audiovisual text and its dubbing, including its multidimensionality, role and function <b>of</b> <b>its</b> dialogue, <b>process</b> <b>of</b> dubbing <b>production</b> and constraints <b>of</b> the contemporary Czech dubbing market. What follows is a contrastive analysis of an opening scene of The X-Files Pilot in its English and Czech dubbed versions with respect to the sequential build-up of the interpersonal dynamics in both versions. Also focused is the interplay of the verbal and non-verbal codes in the action of the characters. For [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This {{composite}} {{thesis is}} the realisation of a practice-based research project. It comprises a compact disc of recorded compositions and a supporting exegesis. The practical outcomes of creative arts practice are presented on the CD. Here, contemporary music composition and production skills, conjoined {{with a personal}} political/philosophical perspective, have been applied {{to the creation of}} what I have called ‘political mashup’. Political mashup is a post- 9 / 11 form of oppositional music that incorporates sampled political speech into composed musical settings. Mass mediated political speech is captured, digitally manipulated, and set to music to form alternative narratives. In the nine pieces presented on CD, prominent power-wielders in post- 9 / 11 Western democracies are ‘corrected’ by their own words, verbalising confessional narratives that speak alternative truths to those disseminated by the broadcast media. These musically imagined realities are set against the backdrops of the war on terror, impending environmental crises, political spin and government alignment with a globally networked capitalist hegemony. I refer to the latter as ‘Empire’, following Hardt and Negris’ (2000) theoretical conception. I argue that a central lever of Empire’s power is its ability to install in populations, through instruments such as the mass media, universalising norms that serve hegemonic interests – prominent among them being the normalisation of violence. My works attempt to escape this field of influence by letting non-violent principles guide the construction of the narratives. The exegesis presents the various contexts within which the creative works may be analysed in detail. My creative practice is placed within historical traditions of musical protest and cultural activism. Through a recounting both of political developments and the mass media’s role in representing them {{in the wake of the}} September 11 2001 attacks on America, I elaborate the personal political/philosophical perspective that oversaw the creative process. This perspective is fashioned through the application of a variety of theoretical tools that are applied within a broader critical methodological framework. In this respect the project crosses disciplinary boundaries; creative arts practice is informed by cultural studies and political theory. The roles of music and sound as means of signifying are examined, and the variety of technical tools and processes applied to the composition and <b>production</b> <b>of</b> the works is catalogued. I recreate the studio-based processes by which the musical pieces were realised, reflecting upon the creative aims, problems, challenges and breakthroughs that I encountered in this creative arts practice. I argue that, in its appropriation of the technological tools and infrastructure of globalised capitalist hegemony, political mashup offers its practitioners a sense of agency in relation to Empire. Counter-hegemonic claims for the music are extended beyond its oppositional content, into <b>its</b> very <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>production</b> and distribution. Particular focus is given to the cultural significance of the Internet as a technology that is enabling networks of geographically dispersed individuals to engage in new, more egalitarian modes <b>of</b> cultural <b>production</b> and exchange...|$|R
