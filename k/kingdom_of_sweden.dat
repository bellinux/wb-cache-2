25|$|The Swedish kings Magnus Eriksson and Christopher of Bavaria decreed wolf hunting a civic duty, {{with only}} priests, parish clerks and landless women exempted. Sweden's first wolf bounty was opened in 1647. The bounties {{remained}} in {{force in the}} new laws of the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> from 1734. Hundreds of Sami extirpated wolves in organized drives. In the 1960s, wolf numbers rapidly declined {{with the onset of}} snow mobiles used for hunting. Sweden's last wolf was killed in 1966, after which, the species was declared legally protected and eventually recolonized the area.|$|E

After the war, despite some local initiatives to rejoin Sweden, and territorial claims by Latvia, the islanders agreed {{to become part of}} newly independent Estonia in 1919 (possibly due to the existence of a Swedish minority in Estonia). According to a census taken in 1934, Ruhnu had a population of 282: 277 ethnic Swedes and 5 ethnic Estonians.|$|E
25|$|Jämtland was {{originally}} an autonomous peasant republic, its own nation {{with its own}} law, currency and parliament. However, Jämtland lacked a public administration and was thus best regarded as an anarchy, in its true meaning. Jämtland was conquered by Norway in 1178 and stayed Norwegian for over 450 years until it was ceded to Sweden in 1645. The province has since been Swedish for roughly 370 years, though the population did not gain Swedish citizenship until 1699. The province's identity is manifested {{with the concept of}} a republic within the <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden,</b> although this is only done semi-seriously.|$|E
25|$|During the Middle Ages, Turku was {{the seat}} of the Bishop of Turku (a title later {{upgraded}} to Archbishop of Turku), covering the then eastern half of the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> (most of the present-day Finland) until the 17th century. Even if Turku had no official capital status, both the short-lived institutions of Dukes and Governors-General of Finland usually had their Finnish residences there. In the aftermath of the War against Sigismund, the town was the site of the Åbo bloodbath. In 1640, the first university in Finland, The Royal Academy of Turku, was founded in Turku. Turku was also the meeting place for the States of Finland in 1676.|$|E
50|$|The Treaty of Kalmar {{was signed}} on 25 September 1397 between {{representatives of the}} three Scandinavian <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden,</b> Denmark, and Norway.

Following Sweden's independence, similar documents were also issued by its kings. In many ways it is a Scandinavian parallel to the English Magna Carta.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> is a {{nation-state}} for the Swedish people, and as such, {{their national}} language {{is held in}} very high regard. Of Sweden's roughly ten million people, almost all speak Swedish as at least a second language, and the majority as a first language (7,825,000, according to SIL's Ethnologue). Swedish is also an official language in Finland where it is spoken by {{a large number of}} Swedish-speaking Finns. The language is also spoken to some degree by ethnic Swedes living outside Sweden, for example, just over half a million people of Swedish descent in the United States speak the language, according to Ethnologue.|$|E
25|$|The flag of Sweden is the {{national}} flag of the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden.</b> It consists of a yellow or gold Nordic Cross (i.e. an asymmetrical horizontal cross, with the crossbar closer to the hoist than the fly, with the cross extending {{to the edge of}} the flag) on a field of blue. The Nordic Cross design traditionally represents Christianity. The design and colors of the Swedish flag are believed to have been inspired by the present coat of arms of Sweden of 1442, which is blue divided quarterly by a cross pattée of gold, and modeled on the Danish flag. Blue and yellow have been used as Swedish colours at least since King Magnus III's royal coat of arms of 1275.|$|E
25|$|Finland {{including}} Karelia and Estonia was {{the eastern}} part of The <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> from its unification around 1100 - 1200 AD until the year 1809 when Finland was conquered by Russia. During the Russian revolution 1917, Finland proclaimed the republic Finland and Sweden and many European countries rapidly acknowledged the new nation Finland. Finland has mainly Finnish (increasing) and Swedish (decreasing) surnames and first names. There are two predominant surname traditions among the Finnish in Finland: the West Finnish and the East Finnish. The surname traditions of Swedish-speaking farmers, fishermen and craftsmen resembles the West Finnish tradition, while smaller populations of Sami and Romani people have traditions of their own. Finland was exposed to a very small immigration from Russia, so Russian names barely exists.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} the treaty was to unify {{disparate}} postal services and regulations so that international mail could be exchanged freely. The signatories of the treaty were the German Empire, Austria-Hungary, Belgium, Denmark, Egypt, Spain, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Romania, the Russian Empire, Serbia, the United <b>Kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> and Norway, Switzerland, and the Ottoman Empire.|$|R
50|$|However, the Treaty of Kiel {{ultimately}} prevailed. Frederik {{was unable}} to secure international support, which was {{in support of the}} treaty. In a short war with Sweden in July and August 1814, Crown Prince Carl John <b>of</b> <b>Sweden,</b> and later King Charles XIV John <b>of</b> <b>Sweden,</b> defeated the Norwegians and ousted Frederik. Carl John's generous peace terms recognized the Norwegian constitution, requiring only those sections which prevented a personal union with Sweden to be modified. On 30 August, King Charles XIII <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> (known as Charles II in Norway) was proclaimed the ruler <b>of</b> the United <b>Kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> and Norway.|$|R

25|$|During the 13th century, the bishopric of Turku was established. The {{cathedral of}} Turku {{was the center}} of the cult of Saint Henry, and {{naturally}} the cultural center of the bishopric. The bishop had the ecclesiastical authority over much of today's Finland and was usually the most powerful man there. Bishops were often Finns, whereas the commanders in the castles were more often Scandinavian or German noblemen. In 1362, representatives from Finland were called to participate in the elections for the king of Sweden. As such, that year is often considered when Finland was incorporated into the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden.</b> As in the Scandinavian part of the kingdom, the gentry or (lower) nobility consisted of magnates and yeomen who could afford armament for a man and a horse; these were concentrated in the southern part of Finland.|$|E
25|$|Due to the Northern Crusades and Swedish {{colonisation}} of some Finnish {{coastal areas}} {{most of the}} region {{became a part of}} the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> and the realm of the Catholic Church from the 13th century onwards. After the Finnish War in 1809 vast majority of the Finnish-speaking areas of Sweden were ceded to the Russian Empire (excluding the areas of the modern-day Northern Sweden where Meänkieli dialects of Finnish are spoken), making this area the autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. The Lutheran religion dominated. Finnish nationalism emerged in the 19th century. It focused on Finnish cultural traditions, folklore and mythology, including music and—especially—the highly distinctive language and lyrics associated with it. One product of this era was the Kalevala, {{one of the most significant}} works of Finnish literature. The catastrophic Finnish famine of 1866–1868 was followed by eased economic regulations and extensive emigration.|$|E
25|$|The first Swedish arrivals in Finland {{have often}} {{been linked to the}} {{putative}} First Swedish Crusade (ca. 1150) which, if it actually happened, served to expand Christianity and annex Finnish territories to the <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden.</b> Simultaneously the growth of population in Sweden, together with lack of land, resulted in Swedish settlements in Southern and Western coastal areas of Finland. The Second Swedish Crusade against the Tavastians in 13th century extended the Swedish settlements to Uusimaa. During the 14th century the population expansion from Sweden proper increasingly took the form of organised mass arrivals: the new settlers came in large numbers in large ships from various parts of Sweden’s Eastern coast, from Småland to Hälsingland. Their departure from Sweden proper to Finland was encouraged and organized by the Swedish authorities. The coast of Ostrobothnia received large scale Swedish settlements during the 13th and 15th centuries, in parallel with events that resulted in Swedish expansion to Norrland and Estonia's coastal area.|$|E
50|$|Duke Eric (son of King Magnus III <b>of</b> <b>Sweden)</b> {{appears to}} be the first to {{construct}} a fortress in the southwest corner of Visby in 1310 as part of a struggle between his brothers for control over the <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> and Norway as well as Danish claims on Gotland; this brings Gotland under Norwegian control. When King Magnus IV, son of Duke Eric, becomes King <b>of</b> Norway and <b>Sweden</b> it falls under his control. In 1356 King Magnus gives control of Norway to his son, King Haakon VI Magnusson, though Magnus still remains as King <b>of</b> <b>Sweden.</b>|$|R

25|$|On 6 June 1815, {{a common}} {{military}} ensign was introduced {{for the two}} united <b>kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> and Norway. This flag was identical to the former triple-tailed military ensign <b>of</b> <b>Sweden,</b> with a white saltire on red {{to be included in}} the canton. Proposed by the Norwegian Prime Minister and unionist Peder Anker, the white saltire on a red background was supposed to symbolise Norway, as the country had previously been united with Denmark and initially continued to use the same flag as an independent country, but with the national arms in the canton.|$|R
25|$|CatherineII ("the Great"), {{who ruled}} in 1762–96, {{presided over the}} Age of Russian Enlightenment. She {{extended}} Russian political control over the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and incorporated most of its territories into Russia during the Partitions of Poland, pushing the Russian frontier westward into Central Europe. In the south, after successful Russo-Turkish Wars against Ottoman Turkey, Catherine advanced Russia's boundary to the Black Sea, defeating the Crimean Khanate. As a result of victories over Qajar Iran through the Russo-Persian Wars, by {{the first half of}} the 19th century Russia also made significant territorial gains in Transcaucasia and the North Caucasus, forcing the former to irrevocably cede what is nowadays Georgia, Dagestan, Azerbaijan and Armenia to Russia. This continued with AlexanderI's (1801–25) wresting of Finland from the weakened <b>kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> in 1809 and of Bessarabia from the Ottomans in 1812. At the same time, Russians colonized Alaska and even founded settlements in California, such as Fort Ross.|$|E
25|$|During the 13th century, Finland was {{integrated}} into medieval European civilization. The Dominican order arrived in Finland around 1249 {{and came to}} exercise huge influence there. In the early 14th century, the first documents of Finnish students at Sorbonne appear. In the southwestern part of the country, an urban settlement evolved in Turku. Turku {{was one of the}} biggest towns in the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden,</b> and its population included German merchants and craftsmen. Otherwise the degree of urbanization was very low in medieval Finland. Southern Finland and the long coastal zone of the Bothnian Gulf had a sparse farming settlements, organized as parishes and castellanies. In the other parts of the country a small population of Sami hunters, fishermen and small-scale farmers lived. These were exploited by the Finnish and Karelian tax collectors. During the 12th and 13th centuries, great numbers of Swedish settlers moved to the southern and northwestern coasts of Finland, to the Åland Islands, and to the archipelago between Turku and the Åland Islands. In these regions, the Swedish language is widely spoken even today. Swedish came to be the language of the upper class in many other parts of Finland as well.|$|E
25|$|Other European {{constitutional}} monarchies. The Principality of Andorra, the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of Denmark, Greenland and the Faroe Islands, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, the Kingdom of Spain, and the <b>Kingdom</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> {{are fully}} democratic {{states in which}} the monarch has a limited or largely ceremonial role. There is generally a Christian religion established as the official church {{in each of these}} countries. This is the Lutheran form of Protestantism in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, while Belgium and Andorra are Roman Catholic countries. Spain and the Netherlands have no official State religion. Luxembourg, which is very predominantly Roman Catholic, has five so-called officially recognised cults of national importance (Roman Catholicism, Protestantism, Greek Orthodoxy, Judaism and Islam), a status which gives to those religions some privileges like the payment of a state salary to their priests. Andorra is unique among all existing monarchies, as it is, by definition, a diarchy, with the Co-Princeship being shared by the President of France and the Bishop of Urgell. This situation, based on historic precedence, has created a peculiar situation among monarchies, as a) both Co-Princes are not of Andorran descent, b) one is elected by common citizens of a foreign country (France), but not by Andorrans as they cannot vote in the French Presidential Elections, c) the other, the bishop of Urgel, is appointed by a foreign head of state, the Pope.|$|E

Following some months of tension and fear of war between the neighbouring nations - and a Norwegian plebiscite held on 13 August which overwhelmingly backed dissolution - negotiations between the two governments led to Sweden's recognition of Norway as an independent constitutional monarchy on 26 October 1905. On that date, King Oscar II renounced his claim to the Norwegian throne, effectively dissolving the United <b>Kingdoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sweden</b> and Norway, and this event was swiftly followed, on 18 November, by the accession to the Norwegian throne of Prince Carl of Denmark, taking the name of Haakon VII.|$|R
