5|$|In 1582, Day's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} quickly. Though weakening, he raced to complete {{another edition of}} Actes and Monuments in 1583, printing it on at least four presses. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for books of this size and ambition to go beyond one or two printings. Holinshed's Chronicles, the only book of the time to rival the Book of Martyrs in scope and reputation, never went into a third edition.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} in publishing religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for the younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E
5|$|In early 1971, Rainbow played {{its first}} show, which {{consisted}} of two sets performed at Richmond Community College in Staten Island. After the show, the group discovered that there was already another band called Rainbow. They decided to drop the name, {{and came up with}} the name Wicked Lester, which Klein liked because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual.</b> While the decision to change the group's name came partly out of a desire to avoid any potential legal issues, it also reflected Klein and Eisen's desire to start playing more original compositions.|$|E

5|$|Orisini's {{election}} was notable {{at the time}} because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for the cardinals to elect friars, since they were seen by some as too rigid. Members of religious orders {{at the time were}} often respected by the cardinals, but rarely elected, with Benedict XIII being only the fourth since the Council of Trent. Unlike the other mendicants elected to the papacy in this period, he was of noble birth, being the eldest son of the Duke of Gravina, but had forfeited his rights to his father's title in order to enter the Dominicans.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{concerns}} over security led to Henry II investing heavily {{in a new}} castle structure on the site between 1171 and 1174. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for a new royal castle {{to be built in}} this part of England during the 12th century, and Henry appears to have been driven by the military threat from Scotland before and during the Great Revolt of 1173 to 1174. Henry II spent almost £600 on the castle between 1170 and 1187, most of it in the first few years, rebuilding the older structure {{under the supervision of the}} Count of Brittany's local tenants, Torfin, Osbert and Stephen of Barningham.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Cape St. Vincent was a naval {{battle that}} took place off the {{southern}} coast of Portugal on 16 January 1780 during the American Revolutionary War. A British fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney defeated a Spanish squadron under Don Juan de Lángara. The battle is {{sometimes referred to as}} the Moonlight Battle because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for naval battles in the Age of Sail to take place at night. It was also the first major naval victory for the British over their European enemies in the war and proved the value of copper-sheathing the hulls of warships.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> at {{the time}} for a {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1943 Germany's armored forces had {{sustained}} heavy casualties. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for a Panzer Division to field more than 100 tanks, and most averaged only 70–80 serviceable tanks at any given time. After the fighting around Kharkov, Heinz Guderian embarked on a program to bring Germany's mechanized forces up to strength. Despite his efforts, a German panzer division could only count on an estimated 10,000–11,000 personnel, out of an authorized strength of 13,000–17,000. Only by June did a panzer division begin to field between 100–130 tanks each. SS divisions were normally in better shape, with an estimated 150 tanks, a battalion of self-propelled assault guns and enough half-tracks to motorize most of its infantry and reconnaissance soldiers—and these had an authorized strength of an estimated 19,000 personnel. At this time, the bulk of Germany's armor was still composed of Panzer IIIs and Panzer IVs, although the 2nd SS Panzer Division had been outfitted {{with a number of}} Tiger I tanks.|$|E
5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she picked it up and hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Surely {{there are}} details in her story which, if {{we looked at}} in cold blood, would excite our suspicion. These burglars made a {{considerable}} haul at Sydenham a fortnight ago. Some account of them and of their appearance was in the papers, and would naturally occur to anyone who wished to invent a story in which imaginary robbers should play a part. As a matter of fact, burglars who have done a good stroke of business are, as a rule, only too glad to enjoy the proceeds in peace and quiet without embarking on another perilous undertaking. Again, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> for burglars to operate at so early an hour, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> for burglars to strike a lady to prevent her screaming, since one would imagine that was the sure way to make her scream, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> for them to commit murder when their numbers are sufficient to overpower one man, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>unusual</b> {{for them to be}} content with a limited plunder when there was much more within their reach, and finally, I should say, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> very <b>unusual</b> for such men to leave a bottle half empty. How do all these unusuals strike you, Watson?" ...|$|R

5|$|Since 2006, all {{prisoners and}} parolees in Queensland have been {{prohibited}} by law (section 132 of Queensland's Corrective Services Act, {{introduced by the}} Beattie Labor Government) from speaking to reporters without permission. Thus, {{for the duration of}} his imprisonment and parole, Wotton could not lawfully speak to the media or attend public meetings without prior approval from his parole officer. Gracelyn Smallwood of the Indigenous Human Rights Committee believed it was designed to muzzle the truth. Terry O'Gorman, President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, has called it 'obnoxious'. Stewart Levitt, the director of the Black and White Justice Foundation remarked that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for a public spokesman and former politician to be prohibited from a public meeting. Welcoming Wotton back home, Alf Lacey, mayor of Palm Island, commented that the conditions were excessive.|$|E
5|$|The Rockefeller Foundation {{offered an}} {{extension}} of Bethe's fellowship, allowing {{him to return to}} Italy in 1932. In the meantime, Bethe worked for Sommerfeld in Munich as a privatdozent. Since Bethe was fluent in English, Sommerfeld had Bethe supervise all his English-speaking postdoctoral fellows, including Lloyd P. Smith from Cornell University. Bethe accepted a request from Karl Scheel to write an article for the Handbuch der Physik on the quantum mechanics of hydrogen and helium. Reviewing the article decades later, Robert Bacher and Victor Weisskopf noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in the depth and breadth of its treatment of the subject, yet required very little updating for the 1959 edition. Bethe was then asked by Sommerfeld to help him with the handbuch article on electrons in metals. The article covered the basis of what is now called solid state physics. Bethe took a very new field and provided a clear, coherent and complete coverage of it. His work on the handbuch articles occupied {{most of his time in}} Rome, but he also co-wrote a paper with Fermi on another new field, quantum electrodynamics, describing the relativistic interactions of charged particles.|$|E
25|$|In 1964, Killearn Estates became Tallahassee's first planned community. Formed {{from land}} {{owned by the}} Coble family and known as Velda Farms, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> in that it had {{underground}} utilities preserving a natural appearance.|$|E

25|$|The 2001 Oklahoma Commission Final Report {{notes that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> for both Rowland and Page {{to be working}} {{downtown}} on Memorial Day, when most stores and businesses were closed.

25|$|The genus {{was first}} {{published}} in 1871 by Louis and Charles Tulasne who had discovered that two species (Sebacina incrustans and S.epigaea) previously referred to Corticium or Thelephora possessed septate basidia, similar to those found in the genus Tremella. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>unusual</b> at that time to separate fungal genera on purely microscopic characters, Sebacina was erected for effused, Corticium-like fungi with tremelloid basidia.|$|E
