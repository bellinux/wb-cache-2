40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} some {{regression}} functions to estimate <b>gold</b> <b>coin</b> future price based on <b>gold</b> <b>coin</b> price, future exchange price, {{price of gold}} traded globally and trend of time. The proposed model {{of this paper is}} used for price estimation of special <b>gold</b> <b>coin</b> traded in Iran. The proposed model of this paper is applied for historical data of future gold prices and the results are discussed. The preliminary results indicate that an increase on <b>gold</b> <b>coin</b> price could increase <b>gold</b> <b>coin</b> future price. An increase on foreign exchange price has negative impact on <b>gold</b> <b>coin</b> future and present trend on time has positive impact on <b>gold</b> <b>coin</b> future...|$|R

5|$|As {{the half}} eagle {{approximated}} {{the size of}} a number of foreign <b>gold</b> <b>coins,</b> such as the British guinea and the French louis d'or, it was accepted readily in international commerce and was of a suitable value for many business transactions. DeSaussure is believed to have struck half eagles first for that reason, after consultation with bank officials. The eagle lacked such equivalents, was too high in value for many transactions, and rapidly became unpopular.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, {{the first}} gold dollar was minted, at the private mint of Christopher Bechtler in North Carolina. Much {{of the gold}} then being {{produced}} in the United States came from the mountains of North Carolina and Georgia, and the dollars and other small <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> issued by Bechtler circulated through that region, and were now and then seen further away. Additional one-dollar pieces were struck by August Bechtler, Christopher's son.|$|E
5|$|Though the <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> were {{certainly}} the most valuable issue, followed by the silver one, the exact relationship between the three issues (gold, silver, and bronze) is not known. The supply of gold was closely controlled by the Aksumite state, as noted by Cosmas Indicopleustes, and other precious metals were undoubtedly also closely controlled, allowing the Aksumite state to ensure the usage of its currency.|$|E

5|$|Human {{occupation}} {{dates back}} to the Beaker culture of the late Bronze Age. There is also evidence of an Iron Age hill fort and prehistoric barrows and field systems. There is evidence of a shrine dating from pre-Roman times, which was re-established as a Romano-Celtic Temple in the mid-4th century. According to at least one source, it is extremely likely this was succeeded by a small late-4th-century Christian oratory. Several Roman finds including <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> of Augustus, Nero, and Drusus, two silver denarii of Vespasian and a Roman carnelian ring were found at the site during quarrying.|$|E
5|$|In 1791, {{following}} {{a study by}} Alexander Hamilton, Congress passed a joint resolution calling {{for the establishment of}} a national mint. Later that year, in his third State of the Union address, President George Washington urged Congress to provide for a mint, which was officially authorized by the Coinage Act of 1792. Despite the authorization, silver and <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> were not struck until 1794. The Flowing Hair dollar, designed by Robert Scot, was initially produced in 1794, and again in 1795. In October 1795 the design was replaced by the Draped Bust dollar.|$|E
5|$|The Indian Head gold pieces or Pratt-Bigelow <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> {{were two}} {{separate}} coin series, identical in design, {{struck by the}} United States Mint: a two-and-a-half dollar piece, or quarter eagle, and a five-dollar coin, or half eagle. The quarter eagle was struck from 1908 to 1915 and from 1925–1929. The half eagle was struck from 1908 to 1916, and in 1929. The pieces remain the only US circulating coins with recessed designs. These coins were the last of their denominations to be struck for circulation, ending a series which had begun in the 1790s.|$|E
25|$|The mint {{has also}} issued two bullion coins {{in celebration of}} the RCMP.

5|$|The Turban Head eagle, {{also known}} as the Capped Bust eagle, was a ten-dollar gold piece, or eagle, struck by the United States Mint from 1795 to 1804. The piece was {{designed}} by Robert Scot, and was the first in the eagle series, which continued until the Mint ceased striking <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> for circulation in 1933. The common name is a misnomer; Liberty does not wear a turban but a cap, believed by some to be a pileus or Phrygian cap (Liberty cap): her hair twisting around the headgear makes it resemble a turban.|$|E
5|$|There are {{no records}} {{relating}} to {{the administration of the}} Mysore territory during the Vijayanagara Empire's reign (1399–1565). Signs of a well-organised and independent administration appear from the time of Raja Wodeyar I who {{is believed to have been}} sympathetic towards peasants (raiyats) who were exempted from any increases in taxation during his time. The first sign that the kingdom had established itself in the area was the issuing of <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> (Kanthirayi phanam) resembling those of the erstwhile Vijayanagara Empire during Narasaraja Wodeyar's rule.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} Lady Spencer's commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci {{suggested to}} Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound {{that was to}} be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume {{on the history of the}} sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the issues}} that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most <b>gold</b> <b>coins.</b> When the Treasury Department issued {{regulations}} allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau {{was one of the}} lowest-status branches of the Department of the Treasury, esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under the Treasury Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the Hoover administration.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty's Treasury the {{bimetallic}} relationship between <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> and silver coins was changed by Royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. This inadvertently resulted in a silver shortage as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard. It is a matter of debate as whether he intended to do this or not. It has been argued that Newton conceived of his work at the Mint as a continuation of his alchemical work.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} in Hawaii, <b>gold</b> <b>coins</b> brought a premium over their face value if {{purchased}} with silver; only gold {{could be used for}} certain transactions, such as paying customs duties. Silver had been heavily imported into the kingdom in the 1870s despite government efforts to slow the flow with taxes, and thus gold was more expensive there in terms of silver than in the United States, which was more stable monetarily. Any large influx of silver into circulation, such as by the Kalākaua coins, meant that silver {{in the hands of the}} public might become worth less in terms of gold. In 1883, Hawaii was in a recession, due in part to a fall in sugar prices because of overproduction.|$|E
