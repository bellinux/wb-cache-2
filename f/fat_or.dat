5|$|Labradors like to eat, {{and without}} proper {{exercise}} can become obese. Laziness is {{a contribution to}} this. Obesity is a serious condition and can be considered the number one nutritional problem with dogs. A study shows that at least 25% of dogs in the United States are overweight. Therefore, Labradors must be properly exercised and stimulated. A healthy Labrador can do swimming wind sprints for two hours, and should keep a very slight hourglass waist and be fit and light, rather than <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> heavy-set. Obesity can exacerbate conditions such as hip dysplasia and joint problems, {{and can lead to}} secondary diseases, including diabetes. Osteoarthritis is very common in older, especially overweight, Labradors. A 14-year study covering 48 dogs by food manufacturer Purina showed that Labradors fed to maintain a lean body shape outlived those fed freely by around two years, emphasising the importance of not over-feeding. Labradors should be walked twice a day for at least half an hour.|$|E

25|$|The plant's flavor, a {{combination}} of onions and strong garlic, is adaptable to numerous cooking styles. In central Appalachia, ramps are most commonly fried with potatoes in bacon <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> scrambled with eggs and served with bacon, pinto beans and cornbread. Ramps can also be pickled or used in soups and other foods in place of onions and garlic.|$|E

25|$|In this reaction, the {{triglyceride}} fats first hydrolyze into free fatty acids, {{and then}} the latter combine with the alkali to form crude soap: an amalgam of various soap salts, excess <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> alkali, water, and liberated glycerol (glycerin). The glycerin, a useful byproduct, can remain in the soap product as a softening agent, or be isolated for other uses.|$|E
25|$|If {{refrigerated}} {{or frozen}} without containment, chocolate can absorb enough moisture {{to cause a}} whitish discoloration, the result of <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> sugar crystals rising to the surface. Moving chocolate from one temperature extreme to another, such as from a refrigerator on a hot day, can result in an oily texture. Although visually unappealing, chocolate suffering from bloom is perfectly safe for consumption.|$|E

25|$|Enfleurage: Absorption of aroma {{materials}} into solid <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> wax and then extraction of odorous oils with ethyl alcohol. Extraction by enfleurage was commonly used when distillation {{was not possible}} because some fragrant compounds denature through high heat. This technique is not commonly used in the modern industry due to prohibitive costs {{and the existence of}} more efficient and effective extraction methods.|$|E
25|$|The case {{dealt with}} a federal law that {{prohibited}} filled milk (skimmed milk compounded with any <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> oil other than milk fat to resemble milk or cream) from being shipped in interstate commerce. The defendant, a company that traded in a form of filled milk consisting of condensed skim milk and coconut oil, argued that the law was unconstitutional because of both the Commerce Clause and the Due Process Clause.|$|E
25|$|The US Preventive Service Task Force {{reported}} {{that not all}} children with a high BMI need to lose weight though. High BMI can identify a possible weight problem, but does not differentiate between <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> lean tissue. Additionally, BMI may mistakenly rule out some children who do have excess adipose tissue. It is therefore beneficial to supplement the reliability of a BMI diagnosis with additional screening tools such as adipose tissue or skin fold measurements.|$|E

25|$|Biodiesel is {{made from}} animal <b>fats</b> <b>or</b> {{vegetable}} oils, renewable resources that come from plants such as jatropha, soybean, sunflowers, corn, olive, peanut, palm, coconut, safflower, canola, sesame, cottonseed, etc. Once these <b>fats</b> <b>or</b> oils are filtered from their hydrocarbons and then combined with alcohol like methanol, biodiesel is brought to life from this chemical reaction. These raw materials can either be mixed with pure diesel to make various proportions, or used alone. Despite one’s mixture preference, biodiesel will release smaller number of pollutants (carbon monoxide particulates and hydrocarbons) than conventional diesel, because biodiesel burns both cleanly and more efficiently. Even with regular diesel’s reduced quantity of sulfur from the ULSD (ultra-low sulfur diesel) invention, biodiesel exceeds those levels because it is sulfur-free.|$|R

Many {{sources say that}} Bertha is a reference to Bertha Krupp, heiress {{and owner of the}} Krupp industrial empire. ("Dicke", meaning <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> thick in German, is apparently not a reference to the physical aspect of Mrs. Krupp.) However, not all accept this connection, and the Germans gave numerous other nicknames to the M-Device.|$|E
25|$|Air-popped popcorn is {{naturally}} high in dietary fiber and antioxidants, low in calories and fat, {{and free of}} sugar and sodium. This can make it an attractive snack to people with dietary restrictions on the intake of calories, <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> sodium. For the sake of flavor, however, large amounts of fat, sugar, and sodium are often added to prepared popcorn, which can quickly convert it to a very poor choice for those on restricted diets.|$|E
25|$|An atrophic scar {{takes the}} form of a sunken recess in the skin, which has a pitted appearance. These are caused when {{underlying}} structures supporting the skin, such as <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> muscle, are lost. This type of scarring is often associated with acne, chickenpox, other diseases (especially Staphylococcus infection), surgery, certain insect and spider bites, or accidents. It can also be caused by a genetic connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome.|$|E

Produce, under the HIP, is defined as fresh, frozen, canned, or dried fruits and vegetables that do not have any added sugar, salt, <b>fat,</b> <b>or</b> oil.|$|E
25|$|The {{perceptions}} of the Spaniards were changing, in part, due to their increasing reliance on native ingredients. The tortillas made with cornmeal or (tamales), heated {{without the use of}} fat did not appear to satisfy the tastes of the conquerors used to pork and culinary techniques based on frying in <b>fat,</b> <b>or</b> sauteed with liberal use of olive oil or bacon. Foods popular in Spain at the time such as cheese were unknown to the inhabitants of the New World.|$|E
25|$|After use Dutch ovens are {{typically}} cleaned like other cast-iron cookware: with {{boiling water and}} a brush, and no soap. After the oven has been dried, it {{should be given a}} thin coating of cooking oil to prevent rusting. Whether that should be a vegetable <b>fat</b> <b>or</b> an animal fat (such as lard) is hotly contested. Saturated fats are more stable than polyunsaturated fats, which tend to go rancid more quickly. If the oven is used regularly, this poses no issue. Mustard oil provides the highest temperature resistance, which would be conducive to cooking.|$|E

50|$|Dioxins are absorbed {{well from}} the {{digestive}} tract, {{if they are}} dissolved in <b>fats</b> <b>or</b> oils (e.g. in fish or meat). On the other hand, dioxins tend to adsorb tightly to soil particles, and absorption may be quite low: 13.8% of the given dose of TEQs in contaminated soil was absorbed.|$|R
