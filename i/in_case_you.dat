By September 2015, with her 2016 presidential campaign underway and beset by continued reports regarding her private email usage at the State Department, her ratings had slumped to some of her lowest levels ever. During 2016 she acknowledged that: [...] "I'm not a natural politician, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> haven't noticed." [...] In July 2017 Bloomberg showed her approval rating at 39 percent.|$|E

He successfully requisitioned the assistance of Pope Clement XI with Anna Maria Franziska. He sent the Archbishop of Prague to reproach her. She cited the example of Marguerite-Louise, adding that the Pope did not bother himself to machinate a reconciliation. Cosimo wrote desperate missives to the Electress Palatine: [...] "I can tell you now, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> are not informed, {{that we have no}} money in Florence..."

Alin from Urban.ro similarly thought that the recording was of a new style compared to Inna's previous work, noting Arabic influences, guitar accords and male vocals complementing the singer. Reagan Gavin Rasquinh of The Times of India wrote, [...] "despite the title, [...] {{has nothing to do with}} the subcontinent, <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> were wondering." [...] According to Urban.ro, [...] "Inndia" [...] refers to the name of a woman who is portrayed in the music video.|$|E

500|$|Paige {{has named}} reality {{television}} series such as Any Dream Will Do, which aim {{to find an}} unknown actor to play the lead role in a musical, as {{the greatest threat to}} theatre today, believing that [...] "actors already striving in the theatre wouldn't dream of putting themselves on these shows". In a later interview, she questioned the seriousness of the actors auditioning for this type of show: [...] "you wouldn't put yourself up for one of those shows <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> got bumped off the first week and all your colleagues saw it". She has also expressed a wish for more new musicals to be put into production, instead of frequent revivals.|$|E

Her mother, who had moved to The Bronx, New York to attend Monroe College, brought the family to Queens, New York, when Minaj was 5. By then the family had a house on West 147th Street. Minaj recalled, [...] "I don't think I {{had a lot of}} discipline in my household. My mom motivated me, but it wasn't a strict household. I kind of wanted a strict household." [...] Minaj successfully auditioned for admission to LaGuardia High School in Manhattan, which focuses on visual and performing arts.

The composition of [...] "Oh My Goodness" [...] is composed of an organ and horns, while the title track, [...] "Heart Skips a Beat" [...] and [...] "Tell the World" [...] draw influence from reggae. [...] "Dance with Me Tonight" [...] is a 1950s saxophone style record with elements of Doo-wop, while the track [...] "Just Smile" [...] {{is reminiscent of the}} work of Burt Bacharach. The disco-pop themed Right Place Right Time, Murs' third studio album, {{was released}} on 26 November 2012. Murs co-wrote the majority of the album with songwriters Steve Robson, Wayne Hector and Ed Drewett. [...] "Troublemaker" [...] was released as the lead single from the album, and it features Flo Rida. Lyrically, it documents Murs' obsession for a woman who he knows is not good for him but he cannot resist her, while Flo Rida delivers a rap verse explaining why he finds alluring women attractive. The BBC's critic John Aizlewood described album tracks [...] "Head to Toe" [...] as adult-themed and [...] "Dear Darlin as solemn in its composition.|$|E

2500|$|Some reviewers {{were less}} {{enthusiastic}} {{in regards to}} the game's cast of characters. USGamer's Jeremy Parish, in his Chrono Cross retrospective, felt that the creators were needlessly harsh in their treatment and uncertain fates of returning Chrono Trigger characters, a sentiment also echoed by Tieryas. Furthermore, Parish criticized the size and quality of the cast, comparing it to a failed attempt to mimic Pokémon or Suikodens large casts. He concluded that too many of the characters didn't impact the game enough, stating, [...] "The characters are the definition of slight – most of them have little personality outside of a hokey accent – but the core cast has purpose, while everyone else is there <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> want to have a giant voodoo doll, mushroom man, or baby alien in your party for some reason. Simon Seamann of RPGamer also criticized the difficulty in switching characters and transferring equipment between them, which he felt discouraged players from experiencing the full-breadth of the varied cast. Lack of character development outside of the core, required cast of characters was also cited as a problem.|$|E
2500|$|A 0.75-mile (1.1-km) hike {{leads to}} the edge of the crater's rim. Signs at the trailhead say that the hike takes 1.5–2 hours round-trip, and {{recommends}} that hikers bring water. Although not difficult, the signs also say that the hike is not a casual one: the mostly unpaved trail winds over uneven rock, ascends 74 steps, then through a tunnel and up another steep 99 steps. Next is a small lighted tunnel to a narrow spiral staircase (43 steps) inside a coastal artillery observation platform built in 1908. From the summit above the observation platform both Waikīkī and the Pacific Ocean can be seen in detail. It is a short but steep hike – it is a 170 m (560ft) elevation gain for a total elevation of 232 m (762ft). There is a water fountain near the bathrooms at the foot of the trail <b>in</b> <b>case</b> <b>you</b> want to hydrate before the hike or fill an empty bottle.
