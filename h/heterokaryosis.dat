5000|$|Many fungi (notably the arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi) exhibit <b>heterokaryosis.</b> The haploid nuclei {{within a}} mycelium {{may differ from}} one another not merely by accumulating mutations, but by the non-sexual fusion of genetically distinct fungal hyphae, although a self/non self recognition system exists in Fungi and usually prevents fusions with non-self. <b>Heterokaryosis</b> is also common upon mating, as, in Dikarya (Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes) mating requires the encounter of haploid nuclei of opposite mating types. The nuclei do not immediately fuse, and remain haploid in a n+n state until the very onset of meiosis: this phenomenon is called delayed karyogamy. <b>Heterokaryosis</b> can lead to individuals that have different nuclei {{in different parts of}} their mycelium, although in ascomycetes, particularly in [...] "Neurospora", nuclei have been shown to flow and mix throughout the mycelium. In heterokaryons, the notion of individual itself becomes vague since the rule of one genome = one individual does not apply any more.

50|$|Another {{prominent}} scientist inspired {{directly by}} Dodge was Esther Lederberg, {{who worked with}} him at the New York Botanical Garden as an intern while she was an undergraduate at Hunter College, Lederberg (n√©e Esther Miriam Zimmer) worked with Dodge under three scholarships between 1941 and 1942, conducting research in <b>heterokaryosis</b> in Neurospora tetrasperma. She wrote her Master's thesis on Neurospora crassa and published two papers on Neurospora crassa before beginning her studies of the bacterium Escherichia coli, and her highly influential development of replica plating, the discovery of fertility factor F (inheritable sex change due to viral infection), temperate lambda bacteriophage, and her pioneering work in transduction.|$|E
50|$|Parasexuality {{refers to}} the process of <b>heterokaryosis,</b> caused by merging of two hyphae {{belonging}} to different individuals, by a process called anastomosis, followed by a series of events resulting in genetically different cell nuclei in the mycelium.The merging of nuclei is not followed by meiotic events, such as gamete formation and results in an increased number of chromosomes per nuclei. Mitotic crossover may enable recombination, i.e., an exchange of genetic material between homologous chromosomes. The chromosome number may then be restored to its haploid state by nuclear division, with each daughter nuclei being genetically different from the original parent nuclei. Alternatively, nuclei may lose some chromosomes, resulting in aneuploid cells. Candida albicans (class Saccharomycetes) {{is an example of a}} fungus that has a parasexual cycle (see Candida albicans and Parasexual cycle).|$|E
50|$|The parasexual cycle, {{a process}} {{peculiar}} to fungi and single-celled organisms, is a nonsexual mechanism of parasexuality for transferring genetic material without meiosis or {{the development of}} sexual structures. It was first described by Italian geneticist Guido Pontecorvo in 1956 during studies on Aspergillus nidulans (also called Emericella nidulans when referring to its sexual form, or teleomorph). A parasexual cycle is initiated by the fusion of hyphae (anastomosis) during which nuclei and other cytoplasmic components occupy the same cell (<b>heterokaryosis</b> and plasmogamy). Fusion of the unlike nuclei in the cell of the heterokaryon results in formation of a diploid nucleus (karyogamy), which {{is believed to be}} unstable and can produce segregants by recombination involving mitotic crossing-over and haploidization. Mitotic crossing-over can lead to the exchange of genes on chromosomes; while haploidization probably involves mitotic nondisjunctions which randomly reassort the chromosomes and result in the production of aneuploid and haploid cells. Like a sexual cycle, parasexuality gives the species the opportunity to recombine the genome and produce new genotypes in their offspring. Unlike a sexual cycle, the process lacks coordination and is exclusively mitotic.|$|E
40|$|In Neurospora, the mating-type locus {{controls}} both mating (A + a is fertile) and <b>heterokaryosis</b> (A + a is incompatible). The two alleles appear stable: no novel fertility reactions {{have ever}} been reported, and attempts to separate fertility and heterokaryon incompatibility functions by recombination have been unsuccessful. In the present approach the locus was studied through a mutational analysis of heterokaryon incompatibility function. A selection system was used that detects vigorous (A + a) heterokaryotic colonies {{against a background of}} inhibited growth. Twenty-five mutants of an a strain were produced following mutagenic treatment with UV and NG: 15 were viable as homokaryons and 10 were not. All but one were infertile, but most showed an abortive mating reaction involving the production of barren, well-developed perithecia with A and (surprisingly) a testers. None of the mutants complement each other to restore fertility. Seven mutants have been mapped to the mating-type locus region of chromosome 1. Restoration of fertility was used to detect revertants, and these were found in five out of the eight mutants tested. (A dose response was observed). In four cases incompatibility was fully restored and in one case it was not. ‚ÄîThe results suggest two positive actions of the locus when in heterozygous (A/a) combination (the stimulation of some stage of ascus production and the inhibition of vegetative <b>heterokaryosis),</b> and one positive action in homozygous combination (the production of a perithecial inhibitor) ...|$|E

The work discussed here is a first report of the isolation of genetically marked strains of J. caries and their use in wheat plant infection studies. Procedures for the isolation of auxotrophic and drug-resistant mutants in haploid strains of J. caries were developed. Preliminary determination of the nuclear condition of secondary sporidia showed that spores were typically mononucleate. Additionally, characterization of the kinetics of secondary sporidial formation in liquid culture provided essential information concerning the extent of the logrithmic phase of growth and spore generation rates. Log-phase sporidia of two monokaryotic, compatible strains of race T-l were mutagenized with nitrosoguanidine. Two "non-leaky" nutritional mutants were isolated and characterized; one required adenine, the other uracil. Five "leaky" nutritional mutants were also isolated. One was identified as a glycine auxotroph, and the other four had mutations in pathways for general nitrogen metabolism. Additionally, secondary sporidia of T. caries were tested for their growth response to twelve different drugs in attempts to isolate drug-resistant strains. Only mutants resistant to cycloheximide were detected. Pairings of compatible auxotrophic strains produced mycelial growth on a minimal medium whereas unpaired strains typically failed to grow. Growth in the absence of nutritional supplements was presumed to be due either to 'forced' heterokaryon formation or syntrophism (i. e., crossfeeding). Inability to successfully isolate viable hyphal tips from colonies arising from paired auxotrophic strains precluded proof of <b>heterokaryosis.</b> Hypodermic inoculations with compatible auxotrophic, drug-resistant, and wild type strains failed to result in teliospore production in wheat plants of the susceptible spring wheat var. 'Red Bobs'. J. caries was successfully reisolated as four morphologically distinct colony or sector types from 38 plants that failed to head normally. It was also isolated from a small number of mature plants showing no signs of disease. All auxotrophic and drug-resistant strains were successfully recovered as individual haploid isolates from outgrown colonies on wheat plant tissue.

Initially, the crosses were conducted by observing the segregation of extranuclear markers in heterokaryotic sectors emerging from the original point of <b>heterokaryosis.</b> This showed that (camA 112), (cs- 67) and (sumD 16) were linked but were probably all unlinked to (oliA 1).

Quantitation of the enzyme in crude extracts, performed by single radial immunodiffusion, showed that the colonial strains have twice the level of enzyme as the wild-type strain.

The yield of glucoamylase from type II cultures is less than half that obtained with type I cultures.

We have analyzed the genetic constitution of such segregants from crosses that involved a carF mutation for overaccumulation of beta-carotene and other markers. The new strains were diploids or partial diploids heterozygous for the sex markers. Diploidy was unknown in this fungus and in the Zygomycetes. Random chromosome losses during the vegetative growth of the diploid led to <b>heterokaryosis</b> in the coenocytic mycelia and eventually to sectors of various tints and mating behavior.

This study was conceived as {{an investigation of the}} population biology of N. tetrasperma to assess levels of intrastrain <b>heterokaryosis</b> (heterozygosity).

Analysis of sequences on the mating-type chromosomes of wild-collected self-fertile strains revealed high levels of genetic variability between sibling A and a nuclei. In contrast, sequences on autosomes of sibling A and a nuclei exhibited nearly complete homogeneity. Conservation of distinct haplotype combinations on A and a mating-type chromosomes in strains from diverse locations further suggested an absence of recombination over substantial periods of evolutionary time.

40|$|The heterokaryotic and {{vegetative}} diploid {{phases of}} Magnaporthe grisea, a fungal pathogen of grasses, have been characterized. Prototrophic heterokaryons form when complementary auxotrophs are paired on minimal medium. Hyphal tip cells and conidia (vegetative spores) taken from these heterokaryons are auxotrophs with phenotypes identical {{to one or}} the other of the parents. M. grisea heterokaryons thus resemble those of other fungi that have completely septate hyphae with a single nucleus per cell. Heterokaryons have been utilized for complementation and dominance testing of mutations that affect nutritional characteristics of the fungus. Heterokaryons growing on minimal medium spontaneously give rise to fast-growing sectors that have the genetic properties expected of unstable heterozygous diploids. In fast-growing sectors, most hyphal tip cells are unstable prototrophs. The conidia collected from fast-growing sectors include stable and unstable prototrophs, as well as auxotrophs that exhibit a wide range of phenotypes, including many recombinant classes. Genetic linkage in meiosis has been detected between two auxotrophic mutations that recombine in vegetatively growing unstable diploids. The appearance of recombinants suggests that homologous recombination occurs during vegetative growth of M. grisea. No interstrain barriers to <b>heterokaryosis</b> and diploid formation have been detected. The mating type of the strains that are paired does not influence the formation of heterokaryons or diploids...|$|E
40|$|Strain 275 FI of Claviceps purpurea, which {{produces}} {{large amounts of}} peptide alkaloids in submerged culture, is a heterokaryon; after several generations on agar media, it segregates the single components. These components (by us labeled V, C, and W) are stable and produce almost no alkaloids under described conditions of submerged culture. The mycelium of strain 275 FI consists of hyphae with multinucleate cells and does not produce conidia. Strains V, C, and W form numerous anastomoses when grown together on agar. By combining strains V and C, a heterokaryon similar to 275 FI in appearance has been obtained. This new strain produces amounts of alkaloids much larger than those produced by V and C separately or in associated submerged culture. We conclude, therefore, that in strain 275 FI the heterokaryotic condition is favorable {{to the production of}} alkaloids. Several conidiaproducing cultures of C. purpurea of various origins, as well as sclerotia of the same species, have been examined. The results demonstrated that the heterokaryotic condition is rare in the cultures, but it is frequent in the mycelium from sclerotia. Since it is known that the production of alkaloids is typical of the sclerotial phase in C. purpurea, it is suggested that this capacity is related to the <b>heterokaryosis</b> of the producing strains...|$|E
