2500|$|The unusual jaw {{mechanism}} and esca of Thaumatichthys {{has been described}} as a [...] "living mouse-trap with bait". The premaxillaries on either side of the upper jaw are able to rotate nearly 180° down to trap prey attracted by the luminescent lure; this closing action is effected by large, <b>extremely</b> <b>well</b> <b>developed</b> upper jaw muscles. Muscles in the illicium allow the esca to be swung forward and backward, so as to better entice prey inside the mouth. The upper {{jaw mechanism}} enables prey to be captured without the lower jaw, which can remain moving for the purposes of respiration. Despite this highly specialized predatory apparatus however, examination of stomach contents revealed sea cucumbers as well as plant matter, suggesting that these fishes are omnivores that will swallow anything edible.|$|E

40|$|The article {{warns against}} the {{negative}} impacts of external assessment. These impacts are already noticeable in Slovenia, specifically and {{mainly in the}} teaching approach and learning efforts used for taking the standardised Matura exams. There is a narrowing of overall learning goals and a neglecting of the areas that, although vital for students’ development, are not assessed in the exams themselves, as well, there are increased stress levels {{before and during the}} exams, which could result in a poorer performance. The article then proposes a portfolio approach in which students set their own learning goals, pursue them, reflect both on their achievements and alternative ways to make better progress. The portfolio approach lends itself <b>extremely</b> <b>well</b> to <b>developing</b> a student’s writing skills gradually, as the awareness of learning goals and the setting of one’s own, in combination with self-assessment and reflection are better motivators than just following preset objectives...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{techniques}} exist {{which can}} be used for the task of behavioural analysis and recognition. Common amongst these are Bayesian networks and Hidden Markov Models. Although these techniques are <b>extremely</b> powerful and <b>well</b> <b>developed,</b> both have important limitations. By fusing these techniques together to form Bayes-Markov chains, the advantages of both techniques can be preserved, while reducing their limitations. The Bayes-Markov technique forms the basis of a common, flexible framework for supplementing Markov chains with additional features. This results in improved user output, and aids in the rapid development of flexible and efficient behaviour recognition systems. 1...|$|R
40|$|A large {{microsatellite}} {{data set}} from three species of bear (Ursidae) {{was used to}} empirically test the performance of six genetic distance measures in resolving relationships {{at a variety of}} scales ranging from adjacent areas in a continuous distribution to species that diverged several million years ago. At the finest scale, while some distance measures performed <b>extremely</b> <b>well,</b> statistics <b>developed</b> specifically to accommodate the mutational processes of microsatellites performed relatively poorly, presumably because of the relatively higher variance of these statistics. At the other extreme, no statistic was able to resolve the close sister relationship of polar bears and brown bears from more distantly related pairs of species. This failure is most likely due to constraints on allele distributions at microsatellite loci. At intermediate scales, both within continuous distributions and in comparisons to insular populations of late Pleistocene origin, {{it was not possible to}} define the point where linearity was lost for each of the statistics, except that it is clearly lost after relatively short periods of independent evolution. All of the statistics were affected by the amount of genetic diversity within the populations being compared, significantly complicating the interpretation of genetic distance data...|$|R

50|$|Early on September 24, the JMA further {{upgraded}} 20W to {{a tropical}} storm and named it Nesat. Nesat continued to drift west with expanding deep convection around the entire system and consolidating convection around the LLCC. The mid-level warm anomaly near the system continued to intensify and convective banding near the LLCC {{became more and more}} tighter. As a result, the JMA upgraded Nesat to a severe tropical storm on September 25. Nesat was originally expected to have undergone rapid intensification until September 25, but the JTWC later reported that the sea surface temperatures was a little less than expected and Nesat could not strengthen rapidly. However, Nesat was still strengthening. With an <b>extremely</b> <b>well</b> <b>developed</b> equatoward outflow, Nesat already had a windspeed of 75 kn (1-min sustained). Late on September 25, the JMA further upgraded Nesat to a typhoon.|$|E
