5|$|Mangosuthu Buthelezi remains {{leader of}} the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party (IFP) despite a {{challenge}} by former IFP chairperson Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi, who formed the National Freedom Party (NFP) after her feud with Buthelezi. The NFP and IFP split {{the vote in the}} Zulu-dominated KwaZulu-Natal province in the previous local government elections, each getting an even share of the vote, while the ANC continued to dominate the former IFP stronghold.|$|E
5|$|Eight of {{the nine}} provincial legislatures were won by the ANC. The EFF {{obtained}} over 10% {{of the vote in}} Gauteng, Limpopo and North West, and beat the DA to second place in the last two. In the other six provinces won by the ANC, the DA obtained second place. This included KwaZulu-Natal, where the DA for the first time beat the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party to second place. In the Western Cape, the only province not won by the ANC, the DA increased its majority from 51.5% to 59.4%.|$|E
5|$|On 30 September 2014, the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party {{expressed}} its {{concern for}} the residents of Khuma as repairs to their homes were delayed and had not yet commenced. Provincial government spokesperson, Bonolo Mohlakoana said that construction was delayed partly {{due to a lack}} of structural engineers, which were needed to assess the structural damage caused to the houses. Several families affected by the earthquake moved to a community centre while waiting for their houses to be repaired after affected families were instructed to move to safer locations.|$|E

NOW's values were in opposition of those expressed by the <b>Inkatha's</b> women's groups.|$|R
50|$|Buthelezi {{at first}} refused to {{participate}} in the first democratic South African elections in April 1994 but chose to enter at the very last minute, after a meeting held on 8 April, when Mandela and de Klerk tried to sway the Zulu king, Goodwill Zwelithini kaBhekuzulu from his dependence on Buthelezi by offering him a guarantee of special status of the Zulu monarchy after the elections. The offer was not immediately successful, but Buthelezi seemed sympathetic to the idea. The foreign mediation team led by former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former British Foreign Minister Lord Carrington were pivotal in reaching a compromise, and convinced the IFP leader to give up the boycott of the elections. Buthelezi therefore signed an agreement with deKlerk and Mandela that guaranteed the ceremonial status of the Zulu king and was promised that foreign mediators would examine <b>Inkatha's</b> claims to more autonomy in the Zulu area. It was probably too late though, because Buthelezi was losing support fast, and as a consequence, his party only narrowly won the elections in KwaZulu-Natal. In May 1994, Buthelezi was appointed Minister of Home Affairs in the first post-Apartheid government, a position he continued to hold following the 1999 elections. He was appointed acting president a number of times during this period.|$|R
40|$|M. A. The {{dissertation}} analyses {{the political}} involvement of two women's organisations, Kontak and Women for Peace, {{during the period}} 1976 - 1990. Both organisations were established in the political watershed year of 1976. Kontak had its roots in `verligte' Afrikaner thinking concerned primarily about {{the image of the}} Afrikaner as oppressor. Women for Peace stemmed from the heart of liberal capitalist thinking fearing that the welfare community was under threat. Both organisations thus arose from the privileged white establishment and in this aspect differ from the many other women's organisations that existed in the period under review. The meaning of "political involvement" is defined in the study and evaluated in terms of the protest registered against the apartheid system, the ideological stand that was taken {{and the extent to which}} race relations improved. The latter was after all an essential objective of both organisations, more particularly to end conflict than to ensure a complete transition to democracy. The positioning, objective and conduct of the abovementioned organisations must of necessity be highlighted against the background of the oppressive political situation of the day. For this reason the study provides an overview of the political context within which the organisations had to function. It commences with the riots of 1976 when the National Party came under increasing pressure to scale down apartheid and make it more acceptable. Mention is made of the power of the National Party to equate matters of national interest with discrete party political interests. Further mention is made of the unbridgeable gap between intra-parliamentary and extra-parliamentary politics and how the decisive power of the latter was publicly suppressed. The impossibility of "political neutrality" is emphasised and that was precisely the label that the two organisations under discussion would have liked to attach to themselves. Kontak and Women for Peace were not the only players in the field of women's organisations. The study briefly discusses a few of the other main players such as the ANC Women's League, <b>Inkatha's</b> Women's Brigade and the Black Sash. Both Kontak and Women for Peace explicitly stated that they wished to seek reconciliation and peace between privileged whites and disadvantaged blacks "outside of the party-political arena". Neither of them could escape their political roots, however. The new enlightenment in the National Party for example prevented Kontak from taking an increasingly critical stand against apartheid. In the same way the much sharper voice of the Women for Peace was silenced by the approval of liberal PFP thinking. Both organisations registered protest within the safety of intra-parliamentary politics. They constituted no revolutionary threat for the apartheid state and their leaders were neither imprisoned nor banned. In summary it can be said that both Kontak and Women for Peace were able to realise the objectives of reconciliation within their chosen but limited target groups. Praiseworthy projects were undertaken and strong anti-apartheid positions were adopted. Democratic adjustments were constantly made with regard to membership, leadership hierarchy and language orientation. As far as the political main stream was concerned both, however, were wrongly positioned. The black majority moved in extra-parliamentary circles, outside the field of experience and even the protest actions of privileged whites. For this reason Kontak and Women for Peace were unable to contribute directly to the democratic transition to black majority rule but to some extent succeeded in sensitising the privileged white communities to accept change...|$|R
5|$|The {{democratic}} process was {{threatened by the}} Concerned South Africans Group (COSAG), an alliance of black ethnic-secessionist groups like <b>Inkatha</b> and far-right Afrikaner parties; in June 1993, one of the latter—the Afrikaner Weerstandsbeweging (AWB)—attacked the Kempton Park World Trade Centre. Following the murder of ANC activist Chris Hani, Mandela made a publicised speech to calm rioting, soon after appearing at a mass funeral in Soweto for Tambo, who {{had died of a}} stroke. In July 1993, both Mandela and de Klerk visited the US, independently meeting President Bill Clinton and each receiving the Liberty Medal. Soon after, Mandela and de Klerk were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Norway. Influenced by Thabo Mbeki, Mandela began meeting with big business figures, and played down his support for nationalisation, fearing that he would scare away much-needed foreign investment. Although criticised by socialist ANC members, he had been encouraged to embrace private enterprise by members of the Chinese and Vietnamese Communist parties at the January 1992 World Economic Forum in Switzerland.|$|E
5|$|Following the Bisho massacre, {{in which}} 28 ANC {{supporters}} and one soldier were shot dead by the Ciskei Defence Force during a protest march, Mandela realised that mass action was leading to further violence and resumed negotiations in September. He {{agreed to do}} so on the conditions that all political prisoners be released, that Zulu traditional weapons be banned, and that Zulu hostels would be fenced off, the latter two measures intended to prevent further <b>Inkatha</b> attacks; de Klerk reluctantly agreed. The negotiations agreed that a multiracial general election would be held, resulting in a five-year coalition {{government of national unity}} and a constitutional assembly that gave the National Party continuing influence. The ANC also conceded to safeguarding the jobs of white civil servants; such concessions brought fierce internal criticism. The duo agreed on an interim constitution based on a liberal democratic model, guaranteeing separation of powers, creating a constitutional court, and including a US-style bill of rights; it also divided the country into nine provinces, each with its own premier and civil service, a concession between de Klerk's desire for federalism and Mandela's for unitary government.|$|E
25|$|Between 1960-1994, {{according}} to statistics from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party was responsible for 4,500 deaths, South African Police 2,700, and the ANC about 1,300.|$|E
25|$|In July 1991, {{following}} a scandal involving secret government funding to the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party and other {{opponents of the}} African National Congress, President F. W. de Klerk removed Malan from his influential post of defence minister and appointed him minister for water affairs and forestry.|$|E
25|$|The country's ruling party, the ANC, was {{reported}} to have spent R1 billion (US$71 million) in campaigning in the election. The Democratic Alliance (DA) {{was reported}} to have spent R350 million and the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party (IFP) spent between R15 million and R20 million. The United Democratic Movement (UDM) reportedly spent under R4 million contesting the election.|$|E
25|$|In December 1972, Mbeki joined Tambo at Heathrow Airport to meet Mangosuthu Buthelezi {{to discuss}} mass {{resistance}} to apartheid. Mbeki {{is credited with}} facilitating the establishment of <b>Inkatha</b> – it was his responsibility to nurture the relationship between Buthelezi and the ANC. Mbeki was deployed to Botswana in 1973 to facilitate {{the development of an}} internal underground.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, he {{was elected}} Chairperson of the ANC for the Southern Natal region, and took {{a leading role in}} {{fighting}} political violence in the region between members of the ANC and the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party (IFP). He was elected the Deputy Secretary General of the ANC the next year, and in January 1994, he was nominated as the ANC candidate for the Premiership of KwaZulu Natal.|$|E
25|$|From 26–29 April 1994, the South African {{population}} {{voted in}} the first universal suffrage general elections. The African National Congress won, well ahead of the governing National Party and the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party. The Democratic Party and Pan Africanist Congress, among others, formed a parliamentary opposition in the country's first non-racial parliament. Nelson Mandela was elected as President on 9 May 1994 and formed a Government of National Unity, consisting of the ANC, the National Party and <b>Inkatha.</b> On 10 May 1994 Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa's new President in Pretoria with Thabo Mbeki and F.W. De Klerk as his vice-presidents. The Government of National Unity lapsed {{at the end of}} the first parliament sitting in 1999, with the ANC becoming the sole party in power while maintaining a strategic alliance with the Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) and the South African Communist Party. After considerable debate, and following submissions from advocacy groups, individuals and ordinary citizens, the Parliament enacted a new Constitution and Bill of Rights in 1996. The death penalty was abolished, land reform and redistribution policies were introduced, and equitable labour laws legislated.|$|E
25|$|In KwaZulu-Natal province, Bheki Cele, provincial {{community}} safety minister, {{blamed the}} <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party, a nationalist Zulu political party, for stoking and capitalising on {{the violence in}} Durban. Both Cele and premier S'bu Ndebele claimed that IFP members had attacked a tavern that catered to Nigerian immigrants {{en route to a}} party meeting. The IFP, which is based primarily in the predominantly ethnically-Zulu KwaZulu-Natal province, rejected the statements, and had, on 20 May, engaged in an anti-xenophobia meeting with the ANC.|$|E
25|$|On 6 August 2009, Zuma {{nominated}} Sandile Ngcobo as Chief Justice of South Africa, drawing {{criticism from}} four opposition groups. On 1 October 2009, the appointment was confirmed. The Democratic Alliance, the Congress of the People, the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party and the Independent Democrats accused Zuma {{of failing to}} consult properly ahead of his nomination of Ngcobo. The opposition urged Zuma to restart the process from scratch saying they would prefer current Deputy Chief Justice Dikgang Moseneke for the post.|$|E
25|$|In some of {{his first}} speeches after {{assuming}} the party leadership, {{he called for a}} non-racist South Africa and for negotiations about the country's future. A couple of months later, in February 1990, he suddenly lifted the bans on the African National Congress (ANC) and the Communist Party of South Africa, released Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners. In legislative terms, he enabled the gradual end of apartheid. De Klerk also opened the way for the negotiations of the government with the anti-apartheid-opposition about a new constitution for the country. Nevertheless, he was accused by Anthony Sampson of complicity in the violence among the ANC, the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party and elements of the security forces. In , Sampson accuses de Klerk of permitting his ministers to build their own criminal empires.|$|E
25|$|The {{newly formed}} Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), led by {{expelled}} ANC Youth League leader Julius Malema, contested its first municipal election since its formation in 2013. Smaller parties included the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party (IFP), which held several municipalities in its stronghold KwaZulu-Natal, and the Congress of the People (COPE), which {{was expected to}} decrease {{its share of the}} vote after the decline in support following the 2014 general election. The National Freedom Party (NFP), a breakaway from the IFP led by former IFP chairperson Zanele kaMagwaza-Msibi, was barred from participating in the election after it failed to pay its registration fee to the Independent Electoral Commission. The party had support in areas where the IFP had been strong, and prior to the election governed a number of municipalities in KwaZulu-Natal in coalition with the African National Congress. The NFP was, however, allowed to contest the election in one municipality, Nquthu, where its local branch had paid the registration fee on time. The party obtained just two seats in this council, down from five seats in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Concerned that COSAG would {{undermine}} the election, particularly {{in the wake of}} the conflict in Bophuthatswana and the Shell House Massacre—incidents of violence involving the AWB and <b>Inkatha,</b> respectively—Mandela met with Afrikaner politicians and generals, including P. W. Botha, Pik Botha and Constand Viljoen, persuading many to work within the democratic system. With de Klerk, he also convinced Inkatha's Buthelezi to enter the elections rather than launch a war of secession. As leaders of the two major parties, de Klerk and Mandela appeared on a televised debate; although de Klerk was widely considered the better speaker at the event, Mandela's offer to shake his hand surprised him, leading some commentators to deem it a victory for Mandela. The election went ahead with little violence, although an AWB cell killed 20 with car bombs. As widely expected, the ANC won a sweeping victory, taking 63% of the vote, just short of the two-thirds majority needed to unilaterally change the constitution. The ANC was also victorious in seven provinces, with <b>Inkatha</b> and the National Party each taking another. [...] Mandela voted at the Ohlange High School in Durban, and though the ANC's victory assured his election as President, he publicly accepted that the election had been marred by instances of fraud and sabotage.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, President F. W. de Klerk {{began the}} {{negotiation}} process {{that was to}} lead to the end of apartheid in 1994. At the time, South Africa was plagued by regular massacres as members of the African National Congress (ANC) and the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party (IFP) fought for dominance. The police and security forces often reacted to demonstrations with indiscriminate force, and the ANC claimed that a hypothesised [...] "Third Force" [...] was engaged in covert destabilisation. The violence caused serious problems in building trust between the parties.|$|E
500|$|The {{newly elected}} National Assembly's first act was to {{formally}} elect Mandela as South Africa's first black chief executive. His inauguration {{took place in}} Pretoria on 10 May 1994, televised to a billion viewers globally. The event was attended by four thousand guests, including world leaders {{from a wide range}} of geographic and ideological backgrounds. Mandela headed a Government of National Unity dominated by the ANC—which had no experience of governing by itself—but containing representatives from the National Party and <b>Inkatha.</b> [...] Under the Interim Constitution, <b>Inkatha</b> and the National Party were entitled to seats in the government by virtue of winning at least 20 seats. In keeping with earlier agreements, both de Klerk and Thabo Mbeki were given the position of Deputy President. Although Mbeki had not been his first choice for the job, Mandela grew to rely heavily on him throughout his presidency, allowing him to shape policy details. Moving into the presidential office at Tuynhuys in Cape Town, Mandela allowed de Klerk to retain the presidential residence in the Groote Schuur estate, instead settling into the nearby Westbrooke manor, which he renamed [...] "Genadendal", meaning [...] "Valley of Mercy" [...] in Afrikaans. Retaining his Houghton home, he also had a house built in his home village of Qunu, which he visited regularly, walking around the area, meeting with locals, and judging tribal disputes.|$|E
500|$|Mandela {{was given}} {{an office in the}} newly {{purchased}} ANC headquarters at Shell House, Johannesburg, and moved into Winnie's large Soweto home. Their marriage was increasingly strained as he learned of her affair with Dali Mpofu, but he supported her during her trial for kidnapping and assault. He gained funding for her defence from the International Defence and Aid Fund for Southern Africa and from Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi, but in June 1991 she was found guilty and sentenced to six years in prison, reduced to two on appeal. On 13 April 1992, Mandela publicly announced his separation from Winnie. The ANC forced her to step down from the national executive for misappropriating ANC funds; Mandela moved into the mostly white Johannesburg suburb of Houghton. Mandela's prospects for a peaceful transition were further damaged by an increase in [...] "black-on-black" [...] violence, particularly between ANC and <b>Inkatha</b> supporters in KwaZulu-Natal, which resulted in thousands of deaths. Mandela met with <b>Inkatha</b> leader Buthelezi, but the ANC prevented further negotiations on the issue. Mandela argued that there was a [...] "third force" [...] within the state intelligence services fuelling the [...] "slaughter of the people" [...] and openly blamed de Klerk—whom he increasingly distrusted—for the Sebokeng massacre. In September 1991, a national peace conference was held in Johannesburg at which Mandela, Buthelezi and de Klerk signed a peace accord, though the violence continued.|$|E
500|$|The new Constitution of South Africa {{was agreed}} upon by {{parliament}} in May 1996, enshrining {{a series of}} institutions to place checks on political and administrative authority within a constitutional democracy. De Klerk opposed the implementation of this constitution, and that month he and the National Party withdrew from the coalition government in protest, claiming that the ANC were not treating them as equals. The ANC took over the cabinet positions formerly held by the Nationalists, with Mbeki becoming sole Deputy President. <b>Inkatha</b> remained part of the coalition, and when both Mandela and Mbeki {{were out of the}} country in September 1998, Buthelezi was appointed [...] "Acting President", marking an improvement in his relationship with Mandela. Although Mandela had often governed decisively in his first two years as President, he had subsequently increasingly delegated duties to Mbeki, retaining only a close personal supervision of intelligence and security measures. During a 1997 visit to London, he said that [...] "the ruler of South Africa, the de facto ruler, is Thabo Mbeki" [...] and that he was [...] "shifting everything to him".|$|E
500|$|In 1985, Mandela {{underwent}} surgery on an enlarged prostate gland, before being given new solitary quarters {{on the ground}} floor. He was met by [...] "seven eminent persons", an international delegation sent to negotiate a settlement, but Botha's government refused to co-operate, calling {{a state of emergency}} in June and initiating a police crackdown on unrest. The anti-apartheid resistance fought back, with the ANC committing 231 attacks in 1986 and 235 in 1987. The violence escalated as the government used the army and police to combat the resistance, and provided covert support for vigilante groups and the Zulu nationalist movement <b>Inkatha,</b> which was involved in an increasingly violent struggle with the ANC. Mandela requested talks with Botha but was denied, instead secretly meeting with Minister of Justice Kobie Coetsee in 1987, and having a further 11 meetings over the next three years. Coetsee organised negotiations between Mandela and a team of four government figures starting in May 1988; the team agreed to the release of political prisoners and the legalisation of the ANC on the condition that they permanently renounce violence, break links with the Communist Party, and not insist on majority rule. Mandela rejected these conditions, insisting that the ANC would only end its armed activities when the government renounced violence.|$|E
500|$|The Convention for a Democratic South Africa (CODESA) {{began in}} December 1991 at the Johannesburg World Trade Center, {{attended}} by 228 delegates from 19 political parties. Although Cyril Ramaphosa led the ANC's delegation, Mandela remained a key figure, and after de Klerk used the closing speech {{to condemn the}} ANC's violence, he took to the stage to denounce de Klerk as the [...] "head of an illegitimate, discredited minority regime". Dominated by the National Party and ANC, little negotiation was achieved. CODESA 2 was held in May 1992, at which de Klerk insisted that post-apartheid South Africa must use a federal system with a rotating presidency to ensure the protection of ethnic minorities; Mandela opposed this, demanding a unitary system governed by majority rule. Following the Boipatong massacre of ANC activists by government-aided <b>Inkatha</b> militants, Mandela called off the negotiations, before attending {{a meeting of the}} Organisation of African Unity in Senegal, at which he called for a special session of the UN Security Council and proposed that a UN peacekeeping force be stationed in South Africa to prevent [...] "state terrorism". Calling for domestic mass action, in August the ANC organised the largest-ever strike in South African history, and supporters marched on Pretoria.|$|E
500|$|African National Congress {{supporters}} {{gathered in}} Johannesburg {{to celebrate the}} party's results. Jacob Zuma dedicated the ANC's victory to Nelson Mandela. The ANC requested an in-depth analysis of election results from its provincial election team in Gauteng. ANC spokesperson Nkenke Kekana said the ANC was concerned about its drop in support in the 2014 elections. Democratic Alliance leader, Helen Zille, published a press release thanking every South African {{who voted for the}} DA. She said that voters had responded positively to the DA's campaign, saying, [...] "We can look back proudly on what was undoubtedly the biggest and best campaign the DA has ever run." [...] Economic Freedom Fighters commander-in-chief Julius Malema dedicated the EFF's result to the girls kidnapped in the Chibok schoolgirl kidnapping, saying, [...] "It looks impossible, but we have proved what looks impossible is possible." [...] EFF supporters gathered at Innes Free Park in Sandton to celebrate the results. <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi {{said in a statement that}} despite low estimations in the Ipsos polls, the IFP managed to retain its fourth-place position in the elections. Buthelezi thanked all South Africans who voted for the IFP and stated that he was proud to serve South Africa. Agang SA: Mamphela Ramphele congratulate all parties and candidates who contested the election. She expressed disappointment at Agang SA's poor performance, but stated that she was proud that her party achieved parliamentary representation despite it only being formed several months prior to the election. African Christian Democratic Party MP Steve Swart expressed disappointment that the ACDP did not grow its share of the vote, but was grateful that they were able to retain their support compared to other parties in the election.|$|E

2500|$|In 2000 reports {{emerged that}} Allan's London {{employer}} and SABC journalist, Cliff Saunders {{was in a}} pay dispute with South Africa's intelligence services over services rendered in the past. According to reports, Saunders had also recruited another journalist, revealed to be Allan to spy on {{the activities of the}} <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party in 19951996. Allan responded to these claims in writing an article for The Sunday Independent where she admitted she had been an [...] "unwitting spy" [...] in London.|$|E
2500|$|On 2 November 1995 Malan {{was charged}} {{together}} with other former senior military officers for murdering 13 people (including seven children) [...] in the KwaMakhutha massacre in 1987. [...] The murders {{were said to have}} been part of a conspiracy to create war between the African National Congress (ANC) and the Zulu <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party (IFP), and maintaining white minority rule. The charges related to an attack in January 1987 on the home of Victor Ntuli, an ANC activist, in KwaMakhutha township near Durban in KwaZulu-Natal.|$|E
2500|$|As a result, Mbeki {{was sent}} back to Swaziland to recruit {{soldiers}} for the organisation's military wing. In Swaziland, Mbeki recruited hundreds of people into the ANC. He also liaised with Buthelezi and the latter's newly formed <b>Inkatha</b> movement, and set up structures within South Africa. Mbeki's aim was to establish contact with as many Black Consciousness Movement (BCM) members as he could and to draw them into the ANC. [...] Ironically, while Mbeki was converting BC adherents into ANC members, he would himself absorb many aspects of BC ideology.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Inkatha</b> YeSizwe means [...] "the {{crown of}} the nation". In 1975, Buthelezi revived the <b>Inkatha</b> YaKwaZulu, {{predecessor}} of the <b>Inkatha</b> Freedom Party. This organization was nominally a protest movement against apartheid, but held more conservative views than the ANC. For example, <b>Inkatha</b> {{was opposed to}} the armed struggle, and to sanctions against South Africa. <b>Inkatha</b> was initially on good terms with the ANC, but the two organizations came into increasing conflict beginning in 1976 {{in the aftermath of}} the Soweto Uprising.|$|E
