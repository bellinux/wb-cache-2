40|$|Nonlinear optical {{microscopy}} is ideally suited for in vivo imaging: it provides label-free contrast revealing intrinsic structural and chemical {{properties of the}} sample in a non-invasive way. Successful nonlinear microscopy relies {{on the use of}} pulsed lasers to obtain high signal levels at moderate average laser power. In particular, broadband excitation increases the nonlinear generation efficiency as well as the spectral coverage. However, lower photodamage thresholds and less straightforward signal interpretation have prevented its application to sensitive samples. In this thesis, a pulse shaper is used to tailor ultrashort pulses for optimal imaging. This work concentrates on Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) because it provides an access to highly specific vibrational spectra. The main concept is to encode molecule-specific information directly in the excitation. This is realized either by <b>direct</b> <b>tailoring</b> in a shaperassisted variant of a Multiplex CARS setup or by phase shaping of a single ultrashort pulse (< 10 fs). The photon load reduction and the optimization of the pulse profile achieved by shaping are demonstrated with the imaging of polymer samples and sensitive biological tissue. The flexibility of the setup allows switching between spectrally resolved acquisition for precise chemical mapping and single channel detection for rapid imaging. Further nonlinear effects can likewise be controlled by pulse shaping. In this work, the systematic modification of the relative intensities of Second Harmonic Generation (SHG), Two-Photon Excited Fluorescence (TPEF) and CARS is investigated as well as selective excitation of fluorophores and molecular vibrations. Multimodal imaging with shaped ultrashort pulses proves to be particularly efficient for biological samples as illustrated by the imaging of plant cells and skin biopsies...|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{intelligent}} tutoring framework {{designed to help}} students acquire problem-solving skills from pedagogical activities involving worked-out example solutions. Because of individual differences in their meta-cognitive skills, there is great variance in how students learn from examples. Our framework takes into account these individual differences and provides tailored support {{for the application of}} two key meta-cognitive skills: self-explanation (i. e., generating explanations to oneself to clarify studied material) and min-analogy (i. e., not relying too heavily on examples during problem solving). We describe the framework’s two components.

The other component supports both self-explanation and min-analogy during analogical problem solving by relying on subtler scaffolding, including a highly innovative example selection mechanism.

40|$|Introduction The gold-standard {{treatment}} for colorectal liver metastases (CLM) is liver resection. Advances in staging, surgical technique, perioperative care and systemic chemotherapy {{have contributed to}} steady improvement in oncologic outcomes for patients following surgery in this subset of patients with stage IV colorectal cancer. The limits of resection continue to expand to include patients with more, larger and bilateral CLM, yet outcomes continue to improve with 5 -year overall survival exceeding 50 % following resection. Chemotherapy is {{an important element of}} {{treatment for}} patients with CLM, and chemotherapy can be combined safely with surgery to improve outcomes further. Methods Tailored approaches to patients include major (anatomic) resection, minor (wedge) resection, liver volumetry, and preoperative enhancement of the volume and function of the planned future remnant liver using portal vein embolization. Results Assessment of response to chemotherapy, analysis of liver remnant volume changes following portal vein embolization, and consideration of the surgical recovery following multistage surgical resection of bilateral CLM enable remarkable survival even among properly selected patients with extensive disease. Conclusions Until laboratory, pathologic, biologic, or genetic studies can define which patients will benefit most from surgical and other treatments, careful application of proven diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to patients with advanced disease will continue to allow surgeons to <b>direct</b> <b>tailored,</b> patient-centered treatment as part of a multidisciplinary team.

40|$|SummaryBackgroundTools which assist {{practitioners}} to identify patient concerns and increase {{understanding of their}} needs can improve both the delivery of care and adherence to treatment. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the validity and reliability of a 14 -item tool, to identify the unmet needs and concerns of older people with asthma. MethodsThe Patient Asthma Concerns Tool (PACT) was developed from a pool of 55 items derived from a comprehensive literature review. After pilot and field testing, the initial 55 item questionnaire was administered to a community sample (n =  193), psychometrically tested, and refined to a 14 item PACT tool which was evaluated by a group of clinicians. ResultsThe PACT was shown to have good content and construct validity and was well received by clinicians. The PACT also correlated well with the Juniper ACQ and Brooks' adherence score on related variables and showed good reliability with good–excellent Kappa and ICC scores. Internal consistency of factors was high, and the overall Cronbach's α was 0. 70. ConclusionThe PACT questionnaire was shown to be a valid and reliable tool clinically and psychometrically. We intend to test it in primary care settings and anticipate that its use will assist health professionals to identify the needs and concerns of older patients with asthma and <b>direct</b> <b>tailored</b> asthma management accordingly...|$|R

40|$|Because {{implicit}} evaluations {{are thought}} to underlie many aspects of behavior, researchers have started {{looking for ways to}} change them. We examine whether and when persuasive messages alter strongly-held implicit evaluations of smoking. In smokers, an affective anti-smoking message led to more negative implicit evaluations on four different implicit measures as compared to a cognitive anti-smoking message which seemed to backfire. Additional analyses suggested that the observed effects were mediated by the feelings and emotions raised by the messages. In non-smokers, both the affective and cognitive message engendered slightly more negative implicit evaluations. We conclude that persuasive messages change implicit evaluations in a way that depends on properties of the message and of the participant.

40|$|Abstract. Component-Based Development (CBD) {{is gaining}} {{popularity}} {{as an effective}} reuse technology. Components in CBD are mainly for inter-organizational reuse, rather than intra-organizational reuse [1]. One of the common forms of reusing commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components is to acquire and customize them for each application. Therefore, components must be developed with consideration of commonality and variability in a domain {{in order to increase}} the reusability and applicability [2]. One effective factor in determining the quality of components is how precisely the variability is modeled and how effective customization mechanisms are provided. COTS components often come in binary and blackbox form, therefore modifying the source code or re-linking object code with library are forbidden. However, much of current approaches to component customization are <b>directed</b> towards <b>tailoring</b> whitebox components, i. e. source code is modified. In this paper, we present a comprehensive set of techniques to realize variability into blackbox components and to provide effective interface-based customization mechanisms.

Purpose: To explore the relationship between sociocultural attitudes towards appearance (SCATA), body shape (dis) satisfaction (BSD), and attempts to change body weight among male and female college students. Methods: Participants were undergraduates (n= 224) attending a large southeastern university. A paper-pencil survey was completed that in-cluded demographic information, SATAQ-R, the Contour Drawing Rating Scale, and a single item assessing current attempts at changing body weight. Results: Logistic regression models revealed that factors related to current attempt to change body weight differed by gender. The two significant factors observed for males included Internalization of SCATA (OR= 1. 18) and BSD (OR= 3. 16). Significant factors for females included awareness of SCATA (OR= 1. 10) and BSD (OR= 8. 09).

40|$|Lynch {{syndrome}} (LS) {{is caused}} by a germline mutation in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The resulting loss of MMR gene function induces a strong mutator phenotype and predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC). LS mutation carriers undergo regular colonoscopic surveillance and have extensive colonic resection in case of cancer because of the chance of metachronous tumors. Given the high risk and early onset of CRC, LS mutation carriers are good candidates for chemoprevention. Furthermore, evidence increases indicating that the response of MMR-deficient tumors to standard chemotherapy and radiotherapy differs from that of MMR-proficient tumors. Efforts should thus be <b>directed</b> at designing <b>tailored</b> strategies concerning both chemoprevention and medical cancer treatment for LS individuals.
