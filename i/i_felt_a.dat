500|$|Howard Blake recalls: [...] "I {{went to a}} {{viewing and}} saw that the film was very profound, with a serious anti-war theme, but a certain amount of 'found' choral music had already been laid in by the editors...I {{explained}} that I loved the film and I thought the choral/orchestral music worked brilliantly but it was very big and rich and <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> score would have to emerge from it and be very pure and expressive and quite small — and that I could only hear this in my head as done by strings only." ...|$|E

I remember doing a promo for one of the last singles and it just felt really old-fashioned. I'm pretty computer-savvy, something didn't feel right, but no one said anything to me. You get Britney releasing [...] "Hold It Against Me" [...] and Gaga's [...] "Born This Way" [...] available on iTunes the day you hear it first. That's how it should be. And there's me waiting for a mid-week chart figure like it's 1989." ...|$|E
500|$|At the World Championships in March 2007, Tarwater {{turned in}} the second-fastest time in the opening round of the 200-meter butterfly. In the semi-finals, he placed tenth, missing the finals by 0.11 seconds. Later in 2007, Tarwater won his second National Championship in the 200-meter butterfly. He led the race from start to finish, beating Gil Stovall by 1.1 seconds. [...] "It was a good race," [...] he said. [...] "I felt really in control. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> lot {{stronger}} and a lot better." [...] At the same event, Tarwater joined Michael Phelps and two other Wolverine Aquatics teammates to win the 4×100-meter freestyle relay {{with a time of}} 3:17.96. [...] Tarwater swam the team's second-fastest leg, behind Phelps. He also placed third in the 100-meter butterfly.|$|E

500|$|The artwork of Royal Robertson, {{a self-proclaimed}} prophet from Louisiana, {{was used for}} the album's cover and interior. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said that Sufjan Stevens uses the artwork [...] "as a {{springboard}} for music that evokes a visionary psyche." [...] Stevens became interested in the work of Robertson after recording music for a friend's documentary on the artist, and said that [...] ", the more <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> weird affinity to this guy and the story of his life." [...] He began to transcribe some of the text that appears in Robertson's artwork, and says this process stayed with him a [...] "long time" [...] and [...] "that some of it started to come up in the lyrics, in the songs I was writing.|$|E
500|$|They {{reached the}} edge of a wood, close to the Temple de l'Amour, and came across a man seated beside a garden kiosk, wearing a cloak and large shady hat. According to Moberly, his {{appearance}} was [...] "most repulsive... its expression odious. His complexion was dark and rough." [...] Jourdain noted [...] "The man slowly turned his face, which was marked by smallpox; his complexion was very dark. The expression was evil and yet unseeing, and though I did not feel that he was looking particularly at us, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> repugnance to going past him. A man later described as [...] "tall... with large dark eyes, and crisp curling black hair under a large sombrero hat" [...] came up to them, and showed them the way to the Petit Trianon.|$|E
500|$|..... {{we turned}} off the dusty French road, through a gateway and into a meadow beside the {{buildings}} of a farm.

The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned the crackling of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E

500|$|Irvine {{scored the}} first {{points for the}} Jaguar team in the race, having failed to score up to that point. He {{described}} the race {{as one of the}} hardest in his Formula One career as his drink bottle did not function correctly along with suffering a blistered foot. He also said that the team's issues were not fully rectified and it would take [...] "six months or so to solve... hopefully we can do it quicker." [...] Salo said that his hands were bruised during the race as his car had no power steering equipped. Michael Schumacher admitted to feeling disappointed after the race, having led the majority of the race until his lap 56 retirement. He stated: [...] "The exhaust was too hot and that was why the rest went wrong. It basically cooked the suspension. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> few laps before that something was wrong but there was nothing I could do about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Emerson saw a kindred {{spirit in}} Very and defended his sanity. As {{he wrote to}} Margaret Fuller, [...] "Such a mind cannot be lost". Emerson was {{sympathetic}} with Very's plight because he himself had recently been ostracized after his controversial lecture, the [...] "Divinity School Address". He helped Very publish a small volume, Essays and Poems in 1839. The poems collected in this volume were chiefly Shakespearean sonnets. Very also published several poems in the Western Messenger between 1838 and 1840 {{as well as in}} The Dial, the journal of the Transcendentalists. He was disappointed, however, that Emerson, serving as editor of the journal, altered his poems. Very wrote to Emerson in July 1842, [...] "Perhaps they were all improvements but I preferred my own lines. I do not know but I ought to submit to such changes as done by the rightful authority of an Editor but <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little sad at the aspect of the piece." [...] He was never widely read, and was largely forgotten {{by the end of the}} nineteenth century, but in the 1830s and 1840s the Transcendentalists, including Emerson, as well as William Cullen Bryant, praised his work.|$|E
500|$|Nielsen {{lived for}} several years in Fort Norman (now Tulita) in the Northwest Territories where his father was with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. His father was an abusive man who beat his wife and sons, and Leslie longed to escape. When he {{graduated}} from high school at 17, he joined the Royal Canadian Air Force even though he was legally deaf (he wore hearing aids most of his life). Following graduation from Victoria School of Performing and Visual Arts in Edmonton, Nielsen enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and trained as an aerial gunner during World War II. He was too young to be fully trained or sent overseas. He worked briefly as a disc jockey at a Calgary, Alberta, radio station, before enrolling at the Lorne Greene Academy of Radio Arts in Toronto. While studying in Toronto, Nielsen received a scholarship to the Neighborhood Playhouse. He noted, [...] "I couldn't refuse, but I must say when you come from the land of the snow goose, the moose and wool to New York, you're bringing every ton of hayseed and country bumpkin that you packed. As long as I didn't open my mouth, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> certain security. But I always thought I was going to be unmasked: 'OK, pack your stuff.' 'Well, what's the matter?' 'We've discovered you have no talent; we're shipping you back to Canada. He moved to New York City for his scholarship, studying theatre and music at the Neighborhood Playhouse, while performing in summer stock theatre. Afterward, he attended the Actors Studio, until his first television appearance in 1950 on an episode of Studio One, alongside Charlton Heston, for which he was paid $75.|$|E
60|$|Though these {{pictures}} confused and puzzled me, I {{could not be}} unmoved by the emotion that was patent in them; and, I knew not why, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> in myself <b>a</b> feeling that with regard to Strickland was the last I had ever expected to experience. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> overwhelming compassion.|$|R
60|$|I {{confess that}} at the thought, and with those {{pictures}} of grim nature before me, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>an</b> unpleasant shiver coursing down my spine.|$|R

500|$|Steve Wozniak (who {{consulted}} with Sorkin {{before he had}} written the screenplay) commented on a trailer released on July 1, 2015 {{that he does not}} [...] "talk that way... I would never accuse the graphical interface of being stolen. I never made comments to the effect that I had credit (genius) taken from me... The lines I heard spoken were not things I would say but carried the right message, at least partly... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> lot of the real Jobs in the trailer, although a bit exaggerated." [...] Wozniak did not ask to see the final script because he did not [...] "think that would be appropriate... it is the creative work of the producer and writer and actors and director and others." [...] He also noted that the trailer's reference to Jobs' initial rejection of his daughter Lisa evoked an emotional response: [...] "It was hard on me, even being quiet, when Jobs refused to acknowledge his child when the money didn't matter, and I can almost cry remembering it." [...] In September 2015, after seeing a rough cut of the film, Wozniak stated that he felt like he [...] "was actually watching Steve Jobs and the others [...] not actors playing them, I give full credit to Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin for getting it so right." [...] In an interview with San Francisco Chronicle on February 10, 2016, Wozniak claimed that the film's scenes between him and Jobs never occurred in reality. Wozniak specifically mentioned that he never requested Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team onstage, as was shown in the movie. However, he added that Jobs did purportedly show a lack of respect towards the group. When asked about the accuracy of the film's portrayal of Jobs, Wozniak replied: [...] "In real life, to real people, that's the way he could be, very sharp, (although) never quite as much as in the movie." ...|$|E

2500|$|This led {{to debate}} amongst the band when the Edge {{was playing the}} song on his Gibson Explorer guitar with a tone used in much of their early {{material}} up to their 1983 album War. Bono was particularly resistant to the guitar tone the Edge was playing with, but the Edge ultimately won the disagreement. As he explains, [...] "It was because we were coming up with some innovative music that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> license to use some signature guitar sounds." ...|$|E

2500|$|I {{must say}} when I bowled at Len <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> sense of {{personal}} grudge I have never known against any other batsman. [...] Ray did too.

We both put in that little bit extra against Len, and he had to take it time after time... he had a poker face and never expressed either elation or disappointment. I tried my wickedest bumpers, hoping that I would have the satisfaction of seeing him look scared.|$|E
2500|$|Blake {{noted that}} {{two or three}} white {{passengers}} were standing, as {{the front of the}} bus had filled to capacity. He moved the [...] "colored" [...] section sign behind Parks and demanded that four black people give up their seats in the middle section so that the white passengers could sit. Years later, in recalling the events of the day, Parks said, [...] "When that white driver stepped back toward us, when he waved his hand and ordered us up and out of our seats, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> determination to cover my body like a quilt on a winter night." ...|$|E

One of the Argentine officers came along and actually struck one of the guards and told us to stand up. We stood up and he shook my hand and a few other guys' hands and said that we shouldn't lie down, that we should be proud of what we'd done." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Clancy {{was imprisoned}} in 1920, he participated {{a hunger strike}} with his fellow prisoners. It was here that Todd Andrews first met him. In his memoir, Dublin Made Me, Andrews {{described}} Clancy's personality: [...] "I was overcome by the extraordinary impact which Clancy’s personality had on me. I had never heard or seen Clancy before nor indeed did I ever see him again but he left an indelible impression of the superman, a man whose commands I at least would have a compulsion to obey as if I had been hypnotised ... In the presence of Clancy <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> mere puppet on a string." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just wondering if there was some other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} of the Deltics was a step change in locomotive performance on the East Coast Main Line. The recently introduced Class 40 diesels had an absolute maximum drawbar horsepower of 1,450 and this could be exceeded by a Pacific steam locomotive if worked hard. On one of O. S. Nock's first Deltic runs (the down Heart of Midlothian loaded to 13 coaches, 530 tons gross) he states [...] "once {{the tail of the}} train was over the 60 mph restriction the throttle was opened to the full, and the surge forward could be felt in the cab. Never previously had <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>a</b> positive thrust in my back when in the second man's seat!" [...] Nock went on to estimate that at 80mph the locomotive was producing about 2,750 drawbar horsepower.|$|E
