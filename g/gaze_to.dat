5|$|Joint {{attention}} or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object {{by means of}} eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, points to an object and then returns their <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed {{it was possible for}} an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.|$|E
5|$|At {{one year}} of age, joint {{attention}} is displayed through a child's understanding of pointing as an intentional act. One-year-olds also establish joint attention for objects within their visual field before objects beyond their current visual field. At this age, infants are not yet able to represent their entire environment, only what they can see. At age 15 months, children recognize the minds of others. At this age, children also {{recognize the importance of}} eyes for seeing and that physical objects can block sight. At age 18 months, infants are capable of following an individual's <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> outside their visual field and establishing (representative) joint attention. 18-month-olds also grasp the intentional, referential nature of looking, the mentalistic experience of seeing and the role of eyes and are skilled at following both gaze and pointing with precision. At two years of age, children display joint attention by extending attention beyond the present and understanding that the targets of other's attention extends to the past as well. Two-year-olds are also capable of representational thought or increased memory.|$|E

5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the gaze of others. They are not limited to following eye <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

Hippies {{accustomed}} to long-form psychedelia like the Grateful Dead were often bewildered by the Arkestra. By this time, the performance included 20–30musicians, dancers, singers, fire-eaters, and elaborate lighting. John Burks of Rolling Stone wrote a positive review of a San Jose State College concert. Sun Ra was featured on the April 19, 1969 cover of the magazine, which introduced his inscrutable <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> millions. During this tour, Damon Choice, then an art student at San Jose, joined the Arkestra and became its vibraphonist.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigated whether eye {{movements are}} informative about retrieval processes. Participants learned facts about persons and locations, {{and the number}} of facts (fan) learned about each person and location was manipulated. During a subsequent recognition test, participants made more <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> high-fan facts than to low-fan facts, and <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> highfan facts had a longer duration than <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> low-fan facts. However, there was no relation between the order in which items were fixated and the relative effect of person or location fan. The effect of person and location fan on gaze duration also did not differ with whether it was the person or location being fixated.

25|$|In {{all three}} works of The Russian Series {{the details are}} located in the corners or away from the center. The wholeness of the “sandy color, that of soil” is left intact, {{interrupted}} in a discrete manner almost secretively or mistakenly. Yet the dominance of the center overpowers the viewer, returning his <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> the middle and away from the discrepancies in color. Kabakov would repeat this strategy from 1983-1988 with a second series called Three Green Paintings. In this series, rather than depict objects, he placed texts on the upper left and right hand corners of what is otherwise a field of green enamel paint.|$|E
500|$|Accommodation is {{the process}} by which the eye {{increases}} optical power to maintain focus on the retina while shifting its <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> a closer point. The long-standing medical consensus is that this is accomplished by action of the ciliary muscle, a muscle within the eye, which adjusts the curvature of the eye's crystalline lens. This explanation is based in the observed effect of atropine temporarily preventing accommodation when applied to the ciliary muscle, as well as images reflected on the crystalline lens becoming smaller as the eye shifts focus to a closer point, indicating a change in the lens' shape. Bates rejected this explanation, and in his 1920 book presented photographs that he said showed that the image remained the same size even as the eye shifted focus, concluding from this that the lens was not a factor in accommodation. However, optometrist Philip Pollack in a 1956 work characterized these photographs as [...] "so blurred {{that it is impossible to}} tell whether one image is larger than the other", in contrast to later photographs that clearly showed a change in the size of the reflected images, just as had been observed since the late nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|An early {{example of}} the Zapatistas' {{effective}} use of the postcolonial gaze was their use of organizations like the United Nations Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) to raise of awareness for their rebellion and indigenous rights, what critics described as the Mexican government's {{lack of respect for}} the country's impoverished and marginalized populations. [...] Appealing to the ECOSOC and other traditionally Western-influenced non-governmental bodies allowed the Zapatistas, it is argued, to establish a sense of autonomy by using the postcolonial <b>gaze</b> <b>to</b> redefine their identities both as indigenous people and as citizens of Mexico.|$|E

2500|$|Cattle hearing {{ranges from}} 23 Hz to 35kHz.

40|$|ABSTRACT—When {{describing}} visual scenes, speakers typically gaze at objects {{while preparing}} their names. In {{a study of}} the relation between eye movements and speech, a corpus of self-corrected speech errors was analyzed. If errors result from rushed word preparation, insufficient visual information, or failure to check prepared names against objects, speakers should spend less time gazing at referents before uttering errors than before uttering correct names. Counter <b>to</b> predictions, <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> referents before errors (e. g., <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> an axe before saying ‘‘ham–’’ [hammer]) highly resembled <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> referents before correct names (e. g., <b>gazes</b> <b>to</b> an axe before saying ‘‘axe’’). However, speakers gazed at referents for more time after initiating erroneous compared with correct names, apparently while they prepared corrections. Assuming that gaze nonetheless reflects word preparation, errors were not associated with insufficient preparation. Nor were errors systematically associated with decreased inspection of objects. Like gesture, gaze may accurately reflect a speaker’s intentions even when the accompanying speech does not. People usually look at the things they think about. Often they talk about the things they think about, too. Despite their many differences, gaze and speech both provide a wealth of information about thought content. When people describe visual scenes, their gazes and their words are synchronized. Words begin roughly a second after speakers gaze at their referents (Griffin & Bock, 2000). These word-related gazes are correlated with the difficulty of word preparation. For example, speakers gaze for more time at objects that have multiple context-appropriate names (Griffin, 2001) or uncommon names (Meyer, Sleiderink, & Levelt, 1998) than at objects that have a singl...|$|R
