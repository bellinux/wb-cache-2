5|$|A {{position}} paper {{published by the}} American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in 2007 warns {{that there is no}} valid medical reason to perform the procedure, which is not considered routine or accepted by the College; and it has not been proven to be safe or effective. The potential risks include sexual dysfunction, infection, altered sensation, <b>dyspareunia,</b> adhesions and scarring. The College position is that it is untenable to recommend the procedure. The procedure is also not approved by the Food and Drug Administration or the American Medical Association, and no peer-reviewed studies have been accepted to account for either safety or effectiveness of this treatment.|$|E
5|$|While {{defended by}} those {{cultures}} {{in which it}} constitutes a tradition, FGC is opposed by many medical and cultural organizations {{on the grounds that}} it is unnecessary and harmful. Short term health effects may include hemorrhage, infection, sepsis, and even result in death, while long term effects include <b>dyspareunia,</b> dysmenorrhea, vaginitis and cystitis. In addition FGC leads to complications with pregnancy, labor and delivery. Reversal (defibulation) by skilled personnel may be required to open the scarred tissue. Amongst those opposing the practice are local grassroots groups, and national and international organisations including WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA and Amnesty International. Legislative efforts to ban FGC have rarely been successful and the preferred approach is education and empowerment and the provision of information about the adverse health effects as well the human rights aspects.|$|E

25|$|Vaginal hypoplasia, a {{relatively}} frequent finding in CAIS and {{some forms of}} PAIS, is associated with sexual difficulties including vaginal penetration difficulties and <b>dyspareunia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Androgen therapy (and {{suppression}} of estrogen production) may cause vaginal atrophy and dryness, which {{may result in}} <b>dyspareunia</b> (painful vaginal intercourse). This can be alleviated with topical estrogen cream.|$|E
25|$|Sexual pain {{disorders}} affect women {{almost exclusively}} {{and are also}} known as <b>dyspareunia</b> (painful intercourse) or vaginismus (an involuntary spasm of {{the muscles of the}} vaginal wall that interferes with intercourse).|$|E
25|$|In {{women with}} SS, vaginal dryness, vulvodynia and <b>dyspareunia</b> (painful sexual intercourse) are often reported; {{personal}} lubricants are recommended to help lessen irritation or pain {{that may result}} from dryness in the vaginal and vulva areas.|$|E
25|$|A {{study of}} {{vaginismus}} in people in Morocco and Sweden found a prevalence of 6%. 18-20% {{of people in}} British and Australian studies {{were found to have}} manifest <b>dyspareunia,</b> while the rate among elderly British people was as low as 2%.|$|E
25|$|Endometriosis is {{a chronic}} disease {{which can cause}} severe, progressive, and at times, incapacitating dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, <b>dyspareunia</b> and infertility. Dydrogesterone {{relieves}} pain without inhibiting ovulation, so that patients are able to become pregnant during treatment. Dydrogesterone is particularly suitable {{in cases where the}} woman desires to become pregnant and to prevent bleeding problems. Dydrogesterone results in statistically significant reductions in the symptoms pelvic pain, dysmenorrhea and <b>dyspareunia</b> after the first treatment cycle for the treatment of post-laparoscopic endometriosis. The amount and duration of menstrual bleeding is also significantly reduced, and {{from the end of the}} third month onwards, bleeding was considered normal in the majority of patients. Improvement of endometriosis was observed in 71% of patients and cure in 21%.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dyspareunia</b> may {{be caused}} by {{insufficient}} lubrication (vaginal dryness) in women. Poor lubrication may result from insufficient excitement and stimulation, or from hormonal changes caused by menopause, pregnancy, or breast-feeding. Irritation from contraceptive creams and foams can also cause dryness, as can fear and anxiety about sex.|$|E
25|$|After {{hysterectomy}} for benign indications {{the majority}} of women report improvement in sexual life and pelvic pain. A smaller share of women report worsening of sexual life and other problems. The picture is significantly different for hysterectomy performed for malignant reasons; the procedure is often more radical with substantial side effects. A proportion of patients who undergo a hysterectomy for chronic pelvic pain continue to suffer from pelvic pain after a hysterectomy and develop <b>dyspareunia</b> (painful sexual intercourse).|$|E
25|$|In {{defining}} {{the range of}} sexual problems Masters and Johnson defined a boundary between dysfunction and deviations. Dysfunctions were transitory and experienced {{by the majority of}} people, dysfunctions bounded male primary or secondary impotence, premature ejaculation, ejaculatory incompetence; female primary orgasmic dysfunction and situational orgasmic dysfunction; pain during intercourse (<b>dyspareunia)</b> and vaginismus. According to Masters and Johnson sexual arousal and climax are a normal physiological process of every functionally intact adult, but despite being autonomic it can be inhibited. Masters and Johnson treatment program for dysfunction was 81.1% successful.|$|E
25|$|The {{maintenance}} and {{improvement of quality}} of life during the menopausal period {{is at the core}} of estrogen and progestin-based hormone therapy. Both HRT and estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) have been shown to enhance sexual desire in a significant percent of women; however, as with all pharmacological treatments, not all women have been responsive, especially those with preexisting sexual difficulties. ERT restores vaginal cells, pH levels, and blood flow to the vagina, all of which deterioration are associated with the onset of menopause. <b>Dyspareunia</b> (due to vaginal dryness) appears to be the most responsive component of menopausal women’s sexuality to ERT. It also has been shown to have positive effects on the urinary tract and atrophy and may initially improve libido or sexual sensitivity. Other improvements in areas such as sexual desire, arousal, fantasies, and frequency of coitus and orgasm have also been noted. However, the effectiveness of ERT has been shown to decline in some women after long-term use. A number of studies have found that the combined effects of estrogen/androgen replacement therapy can increase a woman’s motivational aspects of sexual behaviour over and above what can be achieved with estrogen therapy alone. Findings on a relatively new form of HRT called tibolone— a synthetic steroid with estrogenic, androgenic, and progestogenic properties— suggest that it has the ability to improve mood, libido, and somatic symptoms of surgically menopausal women to a greater degree than ERT. In various placebo-controlled studies, improvements in vasomotor symptoms, emotional reactions, sleep disturbances, somatic symptoms, and sexual desire have been observed. However, while this is and has been available in Europe for almost two decades, this has not been approved for use in North America at this point.|$|E
2500|$|The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) {{published}} an {{opinion in the}} September 2007 issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology that several [...] "vaginal rejuvenation" [...] procedures were not medically indicated, {{and that there was}} no documentation of their safety and effectiveness. ACOG argued that it was deceptive to give the impression that the procedures were accepted and routine surgical practices. It recommended that women seeking such surgeries must be given the available surgical-safety statistics, and warned of the potential risks of infection, altered sensation caused by damaged nerves, <b>dyspareunia</b> (painful sexual intercourse), tissue adhesions, and painful scarring.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dyspareunia</b> (from Greek, , dys- [...] "bad" [...] and , pareunos [...] "bedfellow", meaning [...] "badly mated"). The {{previous}} Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, the DSM-IV, {{stated that}} the diagnosis of <b>dyspareunia</b> is made when the patient complains of recurrent or persistent genital pain before, during, or after sexual intercourse that is not caused exclusively by lack of lubrication or by vaginal spasm (vaginismus). After the text revision of the fourth edition of the DSM, a debate arose, with arguments to recategorize <b>dyspareunia</b> as a pain disorder instead of a sex disorder, with Charles Allen Moser, a physician, arguing {{for the removal of}} <b>dyspareunia</b> from the manual altogether. The most recent version, the DSM 5 has grouped <b>dyspareunia</b> under the diagnosis of Genito-Pelvic Pain/Penetration Disorder.|$|E
