5000|$|To combat this {{dangerous}} habit, in 1971 NHTSA amended Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard № 208 (FMVSS 208) {{to require a}} seat belt/starter interlock system to prevent passenger cars from being started with an unbelted <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupant.</b> This mandate applied to passenger cars built after August 1973, i.e., starting with the 1974 model year. The specifications required the system to permit the car to be started only if the belt of an occupied seat were fastened after the occupant sat down, so pre-buckling the belts would not defeat the system. The interlock systems used logic modules complex enough to require special diagnostic computers, and were not entirely dependable—an override button was provided under the hood of equipped cars, permitting one (but only one) [...] "free" [...] starting attempt each time it was pressed. However, the interlock system spurred severe backlash from an American public who largely rejected seat belts. In 1974, Congress acted to prohibit NHTSA from requiring or permitting a system that prevents a vehicle from starting or operating with an unbelted occupant, or that gives an audible warning of an unfastened belt for more than 8 seconds after the ignition is turned on. This prohibition took effect on 27 October 1974, shortly after the 1975 model year began.|$|E

Of these deaths, 107 were {{children between the ages of}} 1 and 11, 22 were infants, and 32 were women under the height of five feet two inches. In addition to deaths, airbags are responsible for many more incidental injuries and broken bones.

40|$|We {{examined}} state-specific and aggregate {{effects of}} U. S. legislation requir-ing {{the use of}} seat befts among front-seat motor vehicle occupants. Effects of compulsory seat belt use {{on the number of}} occupants fatally injured in traffic crashes were examined in the first eight states adopting such laws. Monthly data on crash fatalities between January 1976 and June 1986 were analyzed using Box-Tiao intervention analysis time-series methods. Because the new laws apply only to front-seat occupants, <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupant</b> fatalities were compared with: (1) rear-seat fatalities; (2) nonoccupant fatalities (motorcy-clists, pedalcyclists, pedestrians); and (3) fatalities among front-seat occu-pants in neighboring states without compulsory seat belt use. Exposure to risk of crash involvement was controlled by analyzing fatality rates per vehi-cle mile traveled. Results revealed a statistically significant decline of 8. 7 % in the rate of front-seat fatalities in the first eight states with seat belt laws. The fatality rate declined 9. 9 % in states with primary enforcement laws and 6. 8 % in states with secondary enforcement only. Rates of rear-seat and non-occupant fatalities did not change when the belt laws were implemented. Use of automobile safety belts reduces the probability of death in a motor vehicle crash by 30 % to 50 % (Evans, 1986; O’Day & Flo-ra, 1982).

40|$|The aims of {{this field}} study are to find out: (1) {{how much people}} know about {{whiplash}} and head rests; and (2) how head rests are positioned in passenger cars. Research was also carried out into the presence of seat belt height adjusters, {{and how they are}} used. The measurements were made in large Dutch car parks outside shopping centres and roadside restaurants, amongst others. In total 685 cars were included. The analysis covers 1, 067 drivers and front-seat passengers aged 12 and over. Eighty percent of the male <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupants</b> proved to have their head rests set too low. On this point, the percentage of women at fault proved to be lower (48 percent) due to their average height. For 28 percent of <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupants,</b> the horizontal distance between head and head rest was incorrect. Car occupants proved to have an imperfect understanding of the correct positioning of head rests. This fact can be pointed to as the main cause of the frequent incorrect positioning. Their understanding of the function of the head rest, and the phenomenon of whiplash, can be viewed as adequate. Despite the fact that half of the cars in the survey had seat belt height adjusters, these adjusters were little used. See also C 7109...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Direction {{of injury}} force {{inferred}} from pelvic radio-graphs {{may be used}} in trauma care to predict associated injuries and guide intervention. Our objective was to compare injury direction determined from anteroposterior (AP) pelvic radiographs with injury forces determined from crash site investigation. Materials and Methods: We studied all 28 subjects from the Crash Injury Research Engineering Network (CIREN) database who met inclusion criteria of pelvic ring disruption, single-event crash, restrained <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupant,</b> diagnostic-quality pelvic radiography, and complete crash investigation data. Assessment of diagnostic quality of pelvic radiography was made by 2 radiologists who were blinded to all other subject information. Crash site investigation data included principal direction of force (PDOF), crash magnitude, and passenger compartment intrusion. An orthopedic trauma surgeon and a fellowship-trained emergency radiologist independently assessed the pelvic radiographs to determine the injury PDOF and the Young-Burgess and Tile fracture classifications, with disputes resolved by an additional emergency radiologist. Agreement between injury forces and pelvic radiographs was assessed using the kappa statistic. Results: The PDOF was anterior in 9 (32 %) and lateral in 19 (68 %) subjects. The readers agreed with the crash primary direction of force in 21 (75 %) subjects (k = 0. 42). In subjects with lateral PDOF, agreement was 89 % (17 / 19) compared to 44 % for anterior PDOF (4 / 9). Interobserver agreement for the Young and Tile classification schemes was moderate (weighted kappa 0. 44 and 0. 54, respectively). Conclusion: Crash site investigation and pelvic radiography may provide conflicting information about primary direction of injuring forces. Presumed anterior impact based on PDOF is not in consistent agreement with the pattern of injury evident on the AP pelvic radiograph.

40|$|Motor vehicle {{collision}} (MVC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of thoracolumbar junction (TLJ) injury. Although it is of no doubt that the use of seatbelt reduces the incidence and severity of MVC-induced TLJ injury, how it is protective for <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupants</b> of an automobile after rollover crashes is unclear. Among 200 consecutive patients with a major TLJ (Th 11 -L 2) injury due to high-energy trauma admitted from 2000 to 2004, 22 patients were identified as <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupants</b> of a four-wheel vehicle when a rollover crash occurred. The 22 patients were divided into two groups: 10 who were belted, and 12 who were unbelted. Patients’ demographics including the mean Injury Severity Score (ISS), incidence of neurologic deficit, level of TLJ injury, and type of TLJ injury according to the AO fracture classification were compared between the two groups. Neurologic deficit was present exclusively in the unbelted group, and the difference in the incidence was statistically significant (P =  0. 04). Similarly, AO type B/C injury was present exclusively in the unbelted group. The belted group had a significantly lower mean ISS than the unbelted group (P <  0. 01). Comparison between the ejected and non-ejected victims within the unbelted group revealed no statistical difference in the incidence of neurologic deficit or type of injury. It is likely that the high incidence of neurologic deficit in the unbelted group was due to the high incidence of AO type B/C injury. This study indirectly proves the efficacy of seatbelt in reducing the severity of rollover-induced TLJ injury. Because of the limited number of cases, it is uncertain whether ejection from vehicle, which occurs exclusively in the unbelted victims, is a crucial factor in determining the severity or type of injury after rollover crashes...|$|R

The study included rear-end impacts between 1990 and 1999 that resulted in at least one permanent neck injury impairment; in total, 430 impacts with 860 occupants and 444 impairments. Of those suffering impairment, 302 were female and 142 male; 235 were seated in the driver's seat and 209 in the front passenger seat. Relative risk estimates for impairing whiplash injury, by gender and seated position: 1. Driver male (DM) /passenger female (PF) relative risk= 0. 5 n= 2182. Driver male (DM) /passenger male (PM) relative risk= 1. 4 n= 573. Driver female (DF) /passenger female (PF) relative risk= 2. 5 n= 1024.

40|$|Despite a {{trend of}} {{decreasing}} teen fatalities due to motor vehicle crashes {{over the past}} decade, they remain {{the leading cause of}} adolescent fatalities in Iowa. The {{purpose of this study was}} to create detailed case studies of each fatal motor vehicle crash involving a driver under the age of 20 that occurred in Iowa in 2009, 2010, and 2011. Data for each crash were gathered from media sources, law enforcement agencies, and the Iowa Department of Transportation. The driving records of the teens, which included their licensure history, prior traffic citations, and prior crashes, were also acquired. In addition, data about the charges filed against a teen as a result of being involved in a fatal crash were obtained. A total of 126 crashes involving 131 teen drivers that resulted in 143 fatalities were analyzed. Many findings for fatal crashes involving teen drivers in Iowa are consistent with national trends, including the overrepresentation of male drivers, crash involvement that increases with age, crash involvement per vehicle miles traveled that decreases with age, and prevalence of single-vehicle road departure crashes. Relative to national statistics, teen fatalities from crashes in Iowa are more likely to occur from midnight to 6 am and from 9 am to noon. Crash type varied by driver age and county population level. Teen drivers contributed to the fatal crashes at a rate of 74 %; contribution of the teen driver was unknown for 11 % of crashes. Speed was a factor for about 25 % of the crashes for which a teen driver was at fault. The same was also true of alcohol/drug impairment. Only 20 % of the rear-seat occupants of the teen drivers’ vehicles wore seat belts compared to 60 % use for the <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupants.</b> Analysis of the teens’ driving records prior to the fatal crash suggests at-fault crashes and speeding violations are associated with contributing to the fatal crash...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assessed}} to {{what extent}} an enforcement campaign influenced seat-belt and helmet wearing on a Pakistani highway. The study setting was the Karachi-Hala highway where a traffic enforcement campaign was conducted from Dec 2009 to Feb 2010. Seat-belt and helmet wearing were observed in Nov 2009 and Apr 2010 at Karachi toll plaza. Differences in wearing rates {{as a function of}} occupants’ age, sex, and vehicle type were compared between the two periods. On average, 9 119 (Standard deviation= 1 896) traffic citations were issued per month from Aug 2009 to Feb 2010; 4. 2 % of which were for not wearing helmet. A 22. 5 % increase in citations was observed for Dec 2009 to Feb 2010 periods compared with Aug 2009 to Oct 2009 periods. Nearly six thousand four-wheeled and four hundred two-wheeled motorized vehicle occupants were observed in Nov 2009 and Apr 2010. Overall, two of the five drivers and one of the five front seat occupants wore seat belts. This proportion was significantly higher in drivers and <b>front-seat</b> <b>occupants</b> of cars than those of heavier vehicles. Similarly, one of two motorcyclists used a helmet but this proportion was 5. 8 % for pillion riders in Nov 2009. The increased enforcement had a limited influence on belt wearing in drivers (+ 4. 0 %; 95 % Confidence Interval [95 %CI]= 1. 8 – 6. 1) and occupants (+ 6. 2 %; 95 %CI= 4. 2 – 8. 2).

These results suggested that serious efforts are required to increase seat-belt and helmet use on Pakistani highways. Improving enforcement resources, increased fines, not allowing such vehicles on roads, and awareness campaigns targeting drivers of heavy vehicles might increase wearing rates in Pakistan...|$|R
