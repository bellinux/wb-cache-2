40|$|Background: In the United Kingdom, {{pharmaceutical}} {{services can}} be delivered by both community pharmacies (CPs) and <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctor</b> practices (DPs). Both must adhere to minimum standards set out in NHS regulations; however, no common framework exists to guide quality improvement. Previous phases of this research had developed a set of characteristics indicative of good pharmaceutical service provision. Objective: To ask key stakeholders to confirm, and rank the importance of, a set of characteristics of good pharmaceutical service provision. Methods: A two-round Delphi-type survey was conducted in south-west England and was sent to participants representing three stakeholder groups: DPs, CPs and patients/lay members. Participants were asked to confirm, and rank, {{the importance of these}} characteristics as representing good quality pharmaceutical services. Key Findings: Thirty people were sent the first round survey; 22 participants completed both rounds. Median ratings for the 23 characteristics showed that all were seen to represent important aspects of pharmaceutical service provision. Participants' comments highlighted potential problems with the practicality of the characteristics. Characteristics relating to patient safety were deemed {{to be the most important}} and those relating to public health the least important. Conclusions: A set of 23 characteristics for providing good pharmaceutical services in CPs and DPs was developed and attained approval from a sample of stakeholders.

40|$|Thesis (M. Pharm. (Pharmacy Practice)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. Due to {{the fact}} that the {{function}} of dispensing is not the exclusive practice of a single profession, there is much conflict surrounding the issue: it forms the crux of the pharmacy profession but it also forms part of doctors’ scope of practice. Separation of the acts of prescribing and dispensing would prevent the interest of the doctor, who has the potential to profit from selling medicines, being placed above the interest of the patient. It would, however, also affect the essential services that many <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> provide to pensioners, unemployed patients, those not covered by a medical scheme and those in rural areas. The implications of <b>doctor</b> <b>dispensing</b> are not clear as conflicting evidence suggests that <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> prescribe more medicine items, injections and antibiotics while preferring certain brand names on the one hand but on the other, evidence shows that <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>dispensed</b> less expensive medicines compared to other health care providers. The main objective of this study was to analyse the prescribing patterns of <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> and other medicine providers in a section of the private health care sector of South Africa for 2005 to 2008 by using a medicine claims database. A retrospective drug utilisation review was conducted by extracting data from a medicine claims database for a four–year period, from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2008. The results revealed that <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> had a lower cost per prescription compared to other health care providers (R 112. 66 ± R 4. 45 vs. R 258. 48 ± R 23. 93) and also had a lower cost per medicine item (R 39. 62 ± R 2. 18 vs. R 112. 43 ± R 7. 56) for the entire study period from 2005 to 2008. <b>Dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> provided more items per prescription compared to other health care providers (2. 85 ± 0. 05 items vs. 2. 30 ± 0. 06 items) but other health care providers claimed more prescriptions per patient per year (7. 50 ± 1. 15 prescriptions vs. 3. 29 ± 0. 07 prescriptions). A higher percentage of generic medicine items were provided to patients visiting <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors.</b> <b>Dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> treated a majority of patients aged above 19 to 44 years of age while other health care providers treated a majority of patients above 59 years of age. Both <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> and other health care providers treated a majority of female patients and issued a majority of medicine items to treat acute conditions. The results also revealed that <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> generally provided relatively inexpensive medicine items, including generic and innovator items, for female and male patients of all ages while other health care providers showed the opposite trend and issued relatively expensive medicine items to these patients. However, when analysing the top twelve pharmacological groups claimed, <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> had relatively higher costs compared to other health care providers for nine of the pharmacological groups (central nervous system, analgesic, cardio–vascular, ear, nose and throat, dermatological, urinary system, antimicrobial, endocrine system and cytostatic). The pharmacological groups contributing to the highest number of medicine items and highest medicine cost contribution were the antimicrobial group for <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> and cardio–vascular group for other health care providers.

In order {{to gain a better}} insight into this troublesome relationship, a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods has been employed. The findings reveal a deep ongoing sense of competition, which is manifest in the form of public debate and continuous attempts to protect professional task domains. Most of the pharmacists interviewed in this study mentioned the "dispensing doctor" as the main problem facing the community pharmacist in South Africa. Meanwhile, the medical profession, as a united front, is fiercely protecting its "inherent" right to dispense medicines.

Background UK pharmaceutical services, including dispensing prescriptions and public health advice, can be provided from both (CP) and, in rural areas, (DP). While there is much similarity between CPs and DPs in the types of services provided, there is also the potential for variation in service quality across settings. Methods A postal questionnaire of DPs and CPs in South West England was conducted to provide a descriptive overview of pharmaceutical services across the settings. A subsection of questionnaire respondent sites were selected to take part in case studies, which involved documentary analyses, observation and staff interviews. Findings Survey response was 39 % for CPs (52 / 134) and 48 % (31 / 64) for DPs. There were three CP and four DP case study sites, with 17 staff interviews. More pharmacies than practices were open at the weekend and they had more staff trained above NVQ level 2. Both doctors and pharmacists saw themselves as medicines experts, as being accessible and having good relationships with patients. Workplace practices and organisational ethos varied both within and across settings, with good practice observed in both. Overall, CPs and DPs have much in common.

40|$|Background: In {{response}} to health workforce shortages policymakers have considered expanding {{the roles that}} a health professional may perform. A more traditional combination of health professional roles {{is that of a}} <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctor</b> (DD) who routinely prescribes and dispenses pharmaceuticals. A systematic review conducted on mainly overseas DDs’ practices found that DDs tended to prescribe more items per patients, less often generically, and showed poorer adherence to best practice. Convenience for patients was cited by both patients and DDs as the main reason for dispensing. In Australia, rural doctors are allowed to dispense Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) subsidised pharmaceutical benefits if there is no reasonable pharmacy coverage. Little was known about the practices of these Australian DDs. 	Objectives: To examine the PBS prescribing patterns of dispensing with matched non-dispensing doctors and identify factors that influence prescribing behaviour. 	Method: A sequential explanatory (QUAN [...] >qual) mixed methodology was utilised. Firstly, rurality-matched DDs’ and non-DDs’ PBS data for fiscal years 2005 - 7 were analysed against criteria distilled from a systematic review and stakeholder consultations. Secondly, structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of DDs to examine the quantitative findings. 	Key findings: DDs prescribed significantly fewer PBS prescriptions per patients but used Regulation 24 significantly more than non-DDs. Regulation 24 biased the prescribing data. DDs prescribed proportionally more penicillin type antibiotics, adrenergic inhalants and non-steroidal anti-inflammatories as compared to non-DDs. Reasons offered by DD-respondents highlighted that prescribing was influenced by an awareness of cost to the patients, peer pressure and confidential prescriber feedback provided on a regular basis. 	Implications: This innovative census study does not support international data that DDs are less judicious in their prescribing. There is some evidence that DDs might reduce health inequity between rural and urban Australian, and that the DD health model is valuable to patients in isolated communities...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Malaysia's stable {{health care}} system is facing {{challenges}} with increasing medicine costs. To investigate these issues a survey was carried out to evaluate medicine prices, availability, affordability, and the structure of price components. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The methodology developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Health Action International (HAI) was used. Price and availability data for 48 medicines was collected from 20 public sector facilities, 32 private sector retail pharmacies and 20 dispensing doctors in four geographical regions of West Malaysia. Medicine prices were compared with international reference prices (IRPs) to obtain a median price ratio. The daily wage of the lowest paid unskilled government worker was used to gauge the affordability of medicines. Price component data were collected throughout the supply chain, and markups, taxes, and other distribution costs were identified. In private pharmacies, innovator brand (IB) prices were 16 times higher than the IRPs, while generics were 6. 6 times higher. In <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctor</b> clinics, the figures were 15 times higher for innovator brands and 7. 5 for generics. Dispensing doctors applied high markups of 50 %- 76 % for IBs, and up to 316 % for generics. Retail pharmacy markups were also high- 25 %- 38 % and 100 %- 140 % for IBs and generics, respectively. In the public sector, where medicines are free, availability was low even for medicines on the National Essential Drugs List. For a month's treatment for peptic ulcer disease and hypertension people have to pay about a week's wages in the private sector. CONCLUSIONS: The free market by definition does not control medicine prices, necessitating price monitoring and control mechanisms. Markups for generic products are greater than for IBs. Reducing the base price without controlling markups may increase profits for retailers and dispensing doctors without reducing the price paid by end users. To increase access and affordability, promotion of generic medicines and improved availability of medicines in the public sector are required...|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} the prescribing practices of Australian <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> (DDs) {{and to explore}} their interpretations of the findings. Design, participants and setting: Sequential explanatory mixed methods. The quantitative phase comprised analysis of Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) claims data of DDs and non-DDs, 1 July 2005 30 June 2007. The qualitative phase involved semi-structured interviews with DDs in rural and remote general practice across Australian states, August 2009 February 2010. Main outcome measures: The number of PBS prescriptions per 1000 patients and use of Regulation 24 of the National Health (Pharmaceutical Benefits) Regulations 1960 (r. 24); DDs' interpretation of the findings. Results: 72 DDs' and 1080 non-DDs' PBS claims data were analysed quantitatively. DDs issued fewer prescriptions per 1000 patients (9452 v 15057; P = 0. 003), even with a similar proportion of concessional patients and patients aged > 65 years in their populations. DDs issued significantly more r. 24 prescriptions per 1000 prescriptions than non-DDs (314 v 67; P= 0. 008).

On average, 83. 3 % of all central nervous system drugs dispensed were analgesic agents. These agents represented 70. 9 % of {{the total cost of}} central nervous system drugs. A high percentage (82. 2 %) of the analgesic agents dispensed were combination or polycomponent analgesics.

40|$|Introduction Multidisciplinary {{models of}} organising and {{providing}} care {{have been proposed}} to decrease the health services gap between urban and rural populations but health workforce shortages exist across most professions and are further exacerbated by maldistribution. Flexibility and expansion {{of the range of}} tasks that a health professional can undertake were proposed. <b>Dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> (DDs) are such an example. As part of DDs’ routine medical practice, DDs are able to both prescribe and dispense medicines to their patients. The granting of a dispensing licence to a doctor is intended to improve rural community access to medicines where there is no pharmacy within a reasonable distance. Method An iterative, qualitative descriptive methodology was used to identify factors which influenced DDs’ practice. Qualitative data were collected by in-depth face-to-face and telephone interviews with DDs. A combination of processes: qualitative content analysis and constant comparison were used to analyse the interview transcripts thematically. Member checking and separate coding were utilised to ensure rigour. Result Thirty-one interviews were conducted. The respondents universally acknowledged that the main reason for dispensing were for the convenience and benefits of their patients and to ensure continuity of care. DDs’ communities were generally more isolated and smaller when compared to their non-dispensing counterparts. DD-respondents viewed their dispensary as a service to the community.

40|$|Background: In Malaysia, {{doctors in}} private clinics (often called <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors)</b> are {{permitted}} to dispense medicines. This potentially may compromise rational dispensing of medicines in general and antibiotics in particular. Aim: This study explored, assessed and compared dispensing of antibiotics between Community Pharmacist (CP) and General Practitioners (GPs) regarding symptomatic diagnosis, antibiotic categories, adherence to therapeutic doses and promotion of generic antibiotics. Method: The study used trained Simulated Patients (SPs), who used a scenario of common cold symptoms at GP private clinics and community pharmacies to observe and explore the practice of antibiotics dispensing. The study was conducted within the period of May to September 2011 in Penang, Malaysia. The data was analysed using descriptive statistics, Chi-square and Fisher’s Exact Tests at alpha level of 0. 05. Results: GPs dispensed more antibiotics than CPs (p= 0. 001) for common cold symptoms. They dispensed more Amoxicillin (n = 14, 35 %) than CPs (n = 11, 11 %) (p < 0. 001) and more Tetracycline (n = 3, 7. 5 %) while no CP dispensed this category (p = 0. 022). On the other hand, CPs (n = 11, 11 %) suggested brand antibiotics where as GPs dispensed only generic antibiotics (p < 0. 001). Generally GPs comply better with the symptomatic diagnosis standard e. g. when asking SPs about the symptoms they had, all GPs (n = 40, 100 %) complied better with this standard. Despite that, they dispensed more antibiotics (n = 26, 65 %) than CPs (n = 29, 29 %) (p = 0. 001). GPs (n = 22, 55 %) also are better than CPs (n = 16, 16 %) in adherence to therapeutic doses (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Findings showed poor adherence to rational dispensing of antibiotics by both providers. Although, GPs adhere better to symptomatic diagnosis and therapeutic dosing of antibiotics than CPs, they unnecessarily prescribe and dispense more antibiotics for Upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) symptoms. Establishing prescription guidance and regulatory actions, especially for URTIs treatment, and separating of medication dispensing are seemed to be crucial steps for the reform. Scopu...|$|R

40|$|PhD (Pharmacy Practice), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 Pharmaceutical {{care can}} be defined as “the care that a given patient {{requires}} and receives which assures safe and rational drug usage” (Mikael et al., 1975 : 567). The supply of medication is an important link in the health care chain, and the supply of chronic medication specifically was reviewed in this study. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2008 d) states that chronic disease and related deaths are increasing in low- and middle-income countries, causing 39 % and 72 % of all deaths in low- and middle-income countries respectively. The main objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the difference between chronic medication prescribing patterns and subsequent claiming patterns for community (retail) and mail order (courier) pharmacies in the South African private health care sector. Computerized claims data for the period 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2010 were extracted from the database of a South African pharmaceutical benefit management company. The chronic database consisted of 6 191 147 prescriptions (N = 17 706 524), 14 045 546 items (N = 42 176 768) at a total cost of R 2 126 516 154. 00 (N = R 4 969 436 580. 88). A quantitative, retrospective, cross-sectional drug utilisation review was conducted, and data were analysed using the Statistical Analysis System® programme. Various providers of chronic medication were analysed, namely <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors,</b> <b>dispensing</b> specialists, courier pharmacies and retail pharmacies. Chronic medication represented 34. 97 % of all medication prescribed. Retail pharmacies dispensed 79 % of this chronic medication (n = 2 441 613 items) and courier pharmacies 19 % (n = 610 964 items). Courier pharmacies dispensed 1 147 687 prescriptions containing chronic medication and retail pharmacies dispensed 4 900 282. The average cost per prescription for chronic medication at retail pharmacies was R 325. 43 ± R 425. 74 (2009) and R 335. 10 ± R 449. 84 (2010), and that of courier pharmacies was R 398. 56 ± R 937. 61 in 2009 and R 436. 57 ± R 1199. 46 in 2010. The top-five chronic medication groups dispensed by both these pharmacy types were selected according to the number of unique patients utilising these medications for at least four consecutive months. The most utilised chronic medication groups were ACE inhibitors (n = 1 611 432), statins (n = 1 449 732), diuretics (n = 962 670), thyroid medication (n = 885 891) and oral antidiabetics (n = 696 631). The average medication possession ratio for retail pharmacies indicated that, on average, statins, diuretics, thyroid medication and oral antidiabetics were undersupplied by retail pharmacies. Courier pharmacies tended to oversupply more often than retail pharmacies, with the cost of oversupplied medication ranging from 9 % to 11 % of total courier pharmacy medication costs. The average chronic prescription, item and levy cost did not vary significantly between courier and retail pharmacies. This indicates that the relative cost of acquiring chronic medication is similar at retail and courier pharmacy. The medication possession ratios of the top-five chronic medication groups, however, did differ significantly. In order to choose the most appropriate provider, the medical scheme provider needs to consider the over- and undersupply of medication. Oversupply may lead to unnecessary costs whilst undersupply may lead to future noncompliance and associated health problems. The costs associated with undersupply of medication in the South African health care sector need further investigation. Doctora...|$|R

Had he intended to go away, why did he not take this little luggage in his hand, being all he had, and of a kind not easily <b>dispensed</b> with? The <b>Doctor</b> made small question about it, however; he had seemed surprised, at first, yet gave certainly no energetic token of it; and when Ned, who began to have notions of things, proposed to advertise him in the newspapers, or send the town crier round, the Doctor ridiculed the idea unmercifully.|$|R
40|$|Background Recent {{attention}} {{has focused on}} access of communities to pharmacy services in rural areas. To increase access to pharmacy services in rural Western Australia some doctors have been granted a licence to dispense medication on the rationale that a pharmacy would not be economically viable in that community. However, {{there have been no}} studies conducted on whether a <b>doctor</b> <b>dispensing</b> service adequately provides a pharmacy service with respect to access and quality. Method Residents of seven single pharmacy towns and seven non-pharmacy rural towns were surveyed to evaluate pharmacy services delivered by a pharmacist and doctor. The towns were chosen to match closely on key demographic features, with an average population of 1, 246 and 1, 263 respectively. A random sample of 150 households from each town was sent the questionnaire on pharmacy services (1050 in each group). Data was also collected from the Health Insurance Commission (HIC) on dispensing locations for the residents of the two groups of towns. Results There was a significant difference in access to pharmacy services with 82. 4 % of participants from pharmacy towns accessing medications within their town compared to 51. 3 % of non-pharmacy town participants. The HIC data supported these trends with pharmacy town residents having relatively higher prescription rates within their town compared to non-pharmacy town residents where {{they were more likely to}} access prescriptions out of their town. Conclusion Pharmacy town participants were more satisfied with access to health and pharmacy services within their town. Continuation of the <b>doctor</b> <b>dispensing</b> policy requires a greater consideration of the pharmacy needs of rural residents...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} process and results of the reform which {{confined}} doctors to prescribing and pharmacists to dispensing in both Korea and Japan from comparative and politico-economic perspectives. At the present time, several years since the reforms were implemented, a 'compulsory separation' is being established in Korea. The claims containing antibiotics against the total claims from the doctor's clinic dropped from 55. 7 % in 2000 to 29. 6 %, {{and the number of}} drugs per claim from 5. 9 in 2000 to 4. 2 in 2008. Japan selected an 'arbitrary separation'. Efforts to raise the rate of the 'separation' have increased the rate from 1 % in 1974 to 57. 2 % in 2007, but nearly half of medical prescriptions are still being <b>dispensed</b> by <b>doctors.</b> Disparity in the two countries has been brought about by what follows: first, the president's political leadership caused a radical shift in the attitude of the bureaucratic group in Korea; second, in their confrontation with doctors the pharmacists' camp in Korea proved to hold political power stronger than that in Japan; third, intervention in policy of progressive civic groups in particular played a pivotal role in accomplishing the reform in Korea.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: India {{has more}} than 20, 000 {{registered}} pharmaceutical manufacturers. Consequently, there is a flood of brand names to choose from. We conducted this study to analyse and sort out the multitudinous brand names thronging the Indian market, and identified those that could create a possible confusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Recent issues of drug formularies like Indian Drug Review, Drug Index, and Monthly Index of Medical Specialities-India were checked and all the brand names given were included. Some other brand names that are available with the pharmacists but {{are not included in}} these indexes were also included in the study for analysis. OBSERVATIONS: Potentially confusing brand names were sorted out and categorised according to the severity of damage they can cause if misinterpreted by the pharmacist or the patient. Subgroups were made according to the brand name, the generic name, and the manufacturers of the drug. CONCLUSION: Several brand names are strikingly identical, similar looking (orthographic), or similar sounding (phonological). Preventing this possible confusion is not the work of any one person involved. We describe the role of prescribing <b>doctors,</b> <b>dispensing</b> pharmacists, consumer patients, and the manufacturing companies to prevent "wrong prescribing" due to similarities in brand names...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to confirm the efficacy, safety, and {{expected}} palatability of amlodipine orally disintegrating tablets (ODT) [RACTAB formulation (Towa, Osaka, Japan) ]. We report the re-analyzed results of 1687 cases in clinical settings obtained through postmarketing surveillance in Japan. Method: Study subjects were patients receiving treatment for the first time with amlodipine ODT for hypertension under routine care. A multicenter central registration system was used for this prospective survey. The survey was conducted fromOctober 2008 to October 2010. The observational period was 12 weeks, during which time surveys on outpatient blood pressure, ad-verse events, palatability, etc. were conducted. Results: Blood pressure stabilized following treatment, and both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were favorably controlled. Adverse events observed were not significantly different from those observed during drug use trials of amlodipine formulations reported in 2003. Moreover, palatability of amlo-dipine ODT showed a 99. 6 % (227 of 228 cases) favorable patient acceptance, which is consistent with the initial design concept of RACTAB formulation. Conclusions: The results of this postmarketing surveillance study indicated that the efficacy, safety, and palatability of amlodipine ODT met our ex-pectations (dissolves quickly in the mouth, tastes good, and is not rough on the tongue). Accordingly, amlodipine ODT are believed to be an easy-to-use formulation for prescribing <b>doctors,</b> <b>dispensing</b> pharmacists, and patients receiving treatment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Prescribing Information System (PIS) is the definitive data source for all prescribing relating to all medicines and their costs that have been prescribed and dispensed in the community in Scotland from 1993. The information is supplied by Practitioner Services Division (PSD) {{who is responsible for}} the processing and pricing of all prescriptions dispensed in Scotland. These data are augmented with information on prescriptions written in Scotland that were dispensed elsewhere in the United Kingdom. Prescriptions are dispensed by community pharmacies, <b>dispensing</b> <b>doctors</b> and a small number of specialist appliance suppliers. In general, GPs write the vast majority of these prescriptions, with the remainder written by other authorised prescribers such as nurses and dentists. Also included in the dataset are prescriptions written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. Note that prescriptions dispensed within hospitals are not included. Data include CHI number, prescriber and dispenser details for community prescribing, costs and drug information. Data on practices (e. g. list size), organisational structures (e. g. practices within Community Health Partnerships (CHPs) and NHS Boards), prescribable items (e. g. manufacturer, formulation code, strength) are also included. Further information is available at the online ISD Data Dictionary which provides additional metadata. The information in the PIS warehouse is supplied by PSD and is sourced through an established centrally managed national payment system, which is updated on a regular basis. The data are provided for research purpose by the Information Services Division (ISD), who collects a wide range of health related administrative data on behalf of the NHS National Services Scotland (part of NHS Scotland) and has been the authoritative source of Scottish national health care statistics for over 50 years. The data are used to enhance decisions about Scottish health care to improve the health of the people of Scotland. ISD is part of the ScottisH Informatics Programme (SHIP), a Scotland wide research platform for the collation, management, dissemination and analysis of Electronic Patient Records. As part of SHIP, ISD delivers Electronic Data Research and Innovation Service (eDRIS), a one stop shop for health research designed to provide a single point of contact and to assist researchers in study design, approvals and data (non-patient or patient identifiable) access in a secure environment (the NSS National Safe Haven). The Prescribing Information System covers prescribing relating to all medicines and their costs that are prescribed and dispensed in the community in Scotland. A range of geographical and organisational measures are available in the dataset for patient residential address / prescriber / dispenser. These include&# 58; NHS Board Council Area Local Government District UK Parliamentary Constituency Scottish Parliamentary Constituency Electoral Ward Community Health Partnership Data Zone Census Output Areas Postcode Urban / Rural Codes Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation measures Carstairs Deprivation measures On April 1 st 2006 the configuration of NHS Boards was changed with NHS Argyll & Clyde being dissolved. The larger part of its area moved into NHS Greater Glasgow with the remainder moving to NHS Highland. Research Usage and Linkage Prescription drugs {{are one of the most}} common forms of treatment in the NHS and the majority of the population of Scotland are in receipt of prescription drugs at any point of time. Therefore the Prescribing Information System is a unique, complete and high quality source of information on prescribing in Scotland. As prescription expenditure covers in excess of £ 1 billion and around 15 % of the total NHS general revenue allocation in Scotland there is strong interest from the Scottish Government and NHS service providers for information to ensure the clinical and cost effectiveness of these treatments as well as policy development. Prescribing data are also in demand for medical research such as clinical trials and epidemiology. Prescription data are also used for target monitoring, national statistics publications, information requests (including Parliamentary Questions), health services research, performance management and providing information to support health promotion. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) uses prescribing data on proportion of population being prescribed drugs for anxiety, depression and psychosis in the Health Domain. A number of commercial organisations use prescribing and dispensing data both in the form of published information on the website and information requests for bespoke tabulations and extractions. These include pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy contractors and drug wholesale suppliers. Pharmaceutical companies use the information to inform new drug development and the uptake, effectiveness and safety of drugs current in use. ISD produces a range of prescribing related publications. Prescribing indicators are available from the Scottish Neighbourhood Statistics website. Note that the availability of CHI data from April 2009 onwards means that it is possible to relate prescribing data to other ISD datasets holding the CHI variable. </div...|$|R
