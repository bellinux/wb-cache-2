40|$|Our object, in this study, is {{to prove}} the {{character}} of the workers 2 ̆ 7 group in forest owners 2 ̆ 7 association and to research a direction of <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 organization. We investigated the actual conditions at Kuma-village (Kumamoto prefecture), Aug. 1969. We chose three hamlets (Otuki, Yokoi, Kiwada) and have compared the forest group of forest owners 2 ̆ 7 association with other <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 organization. The results so far achieved are as follows: The workers 2 ̆ 7 group in forest owners 2 ̆ 7 association is making a new development as the <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 organization in private <b>forest.</b> This <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 group will make more progress and more socialization of the labour than the other organization of <b>forest</b> <b>workers.</b> In conclusion, the workers 2 ̆ 7 group in the forest owners 2 ̆ 7 association plays an important part in the process of <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> 2 ̆ 7 reorganization...|$|R

40|$|The {{sickness}} absence {{records of}} 1, 115 <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> {{in the highlands}} of Scotland during 1958 were examined. Only absences of four days or more were considered. Two hundred and seventy of the workers were established and were therefore entitled to retirement pensions. There was {{a high proportion of}} older men among the established workers; but the sickness record of these men was generally better than that of the unestablished workers except in respect of cardiovascular disease, rheumatism, and arthritis. Among <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> as a whole, accidsnts off duty accounted for more sickness absence than accidents on duty, a reversal of the finding in the male working population at large. The second most important cause of sickness absence was back troubles of all kinds. Among the male working population at large the second most important cause of absence was bronchitis, a disease which among <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> comes 13 th on the list. A comparison was made between the sickness absence record of the highland <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> and a group of telephone construction gang hands performing broadly comparable work (as regards health hazards) in the same area but whose members were drawn from more urban homes.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} how workers {{actively}} {{introduced a new}} technique to their own labour process. More specifically, it is concerned with how Swedish <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> during the 1950 s gradually replaced the manual one-man crosscut saw with the motor-driven saw. The workers’ own views and actions are of central importance {{to the analysis of}} this process of technical change. Therefore fifty elderly <b>forest</b> <b>workers,</b> who had worked in forests in the county of Västerbotten in northern Sweden, were inter­viewed. The point of departure of the study {{is the fact that it}} was the <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> themselves who financed and bought the chain saw. The study indicates that there were two main reasons for acquiring a chain saw. The <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> hoped to lessen the physical work load and to improve their wages. The first workers to use the chain saw I called ”the pioneers”. They had made some, but rather little, acquaintance with the chain saw before they started to use it. They were often disappointed with the new tool. In the middle of the 1950 s, the construction of the chain saws was improved and, as a result, the chain saw made its breakthrough in the second half of the 1950 s. Those who bought the chain saw during this period were clearly more pleased with it than the pioneers had been. A few years into the 1960 s, when almost all <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> had bought a chain saw, unemployment slowly started to increase. Simultaneously, the piecework wage system began to change. The chain saws were by this time becoming very efficient, and the benefit could and would not go solely to the <b>forest</b> <b>workers.</b> Employers and <b>forest</b> owners were also to have a share and they manifested this will in the wage negotiations. The <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> responded by increasing their work tempo, to make the salaries remain at a high level, at least for the most efficient workers. For others, the older and those who were less productive, things became harder. The increase in work intensity brought with it an increase in accidents and injuries. The workers’ satisfaction in their job deteriorated. The lesson the <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> learned, and this guided their actions when new machines were introduced later, was that it was important to act as a collective. Equally important, however, was the insight that good working conditions and a positive wage development do not only depend on technology, but on the social order in which the technology is embedded. digitalisering@um...|$|R

The prevalence of Raynaud's phenomenon (RP) was 47 % in chain saw operators, 14 % in <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> not exposed to vibration, and 9 % in 302 indoor workers not exposed to vibration. The high prevalence of RP in chain saw operators was attributed to a traumatic vasospastic disease (TVD). The average time of latency was eight years. The standard symptoms of TVD were attacks of blanching and numbness. Cyanosis and pain occurred rarely. In subsamples, measurements of tactile two-point discrimination and maximal isometric muscle strength (hand grip and finger pressure) as well as x-ray examinations of the wrists and the hands gave no evidence of vibration injury to peripheral nerves, muscles, bones, or joints...|$|R

A postal questionnaire was distributed to 115 experts on forest operations nationwide, and personal interviews were conducted with 106 <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> in 13 prefectures of Greece. The questionnaire was completed by 99 forestry experts with long experience on forestry issues all over Greece. The majority of the participants believed that {{there is a lack of}} interest on behalf of the State and that the most pressing problems are income-related. The results indicate that the number of <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> will continue to decline unless specific measures are taken. Changes in the forest management systems are necessary since the present status has not lived up to the expectations. The introduction of a forest workers&# 8217; training system is expected to bring professionalism to the sector of forest operations, increase the overall productivity and improve the perspectives of the forestry workforce in Greece...|$|R
