Several of the original The Kids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> characters appear in cameo roles, including Mark McKinney's Chicken Lady as a candidate juror and Paul Bellini clad only in his towel at an ATM; in addition, McCulloch and McKinney's police officers are tweaked variations of their OPP officer characters of the original series.|$|E

5|$|Longtime Quarter Horse breeder and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of Sayre, Oklahoma, bred Easy Jet {{from two}} future AQHA Hall of Fame members, Jet Deck and Thoroughbred mare Lena's Bar in 1967. His dam, or mother, Lena's Bar, had {{produced}} {{a small number}} of other offspring, but Easy Jet was her last; she died shortly after he was weaned, or removed from his mother's milk. Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the grandsire of Jet Deck's dam. Easy Jet is one of only two horses in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Fame; his two grandsires, Moon Deck and Three Bars, are also <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Fame.|$|E

5|$|The {{series was}} {{proposed}} by Bruce McCulloch during a 2008 The Kids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> comedy tour and {{developed by the}} ensemble into a dark-comedy murder mystery, a departure from their typical sketch comedy format.

While the members of The Kids <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> play all of the major adult characters, a number of other comedic actors appear in supporting roles, including Dan Redican, Colin Mochrie, Wayne Robson, Susan Kent and Mike Beaver. The series was filmed in North Bay, Mattawa and Sturgeon Falls, Ontario in the summer of 2009.|$|E

5|$|Whenever {{the flag}} is {{displayed}} indoors in halls at public meetings or gatherings of any kind, it {{should always be}} on the right (observers' left), as this is the position of authority. So when the flag is displayed next to a speaker <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> or other meeting place, it must be placed on the speaker's right hand. When it is displayed elsewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> it should be {{to the right of the}} audience. The flag should be displayed completely spread out with the saffron stripe on top. If hung vertically on the wall behind the podium, the saffron stripe should be to the left of the onlookers facing the flag with the hoist cord at the top.|$|E

5|$|Although RSV Lahn-Dill, {{eager to}} develop young players, would only let her {{play in the}} seconds, Dillmann caught the {{attention}} of national coach Holger Glinicki, who was looking for a top-notch 1.0-point player. In 2010, she rejoined the national team that she had played on before many of her new teammates were born. The team {{went on to win the}} European Championships in 2011. Dillmann's treatment contrasted with that of national team mate Gesche Schünemann. While Schünemann received endorsements and could train <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> of RSV Lahn-Dill's Rivers Barracks, Dillmann got none, and trained outdoors.|$|E
5|$|Although most wrestlers are {{inducted}} individually, tag {{teams have}} been inducted together.

5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and the huge windows <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder. Indeed, this vulnerability may have been intentional - its builder Laurence was a newly moneyed member of the upper class, and he may not have wanted to erect a fortification that would have threatened the established Marcher Lords in the region.|$|E

5|$|From 1964 to 1978, the Giants {{registered}} {{just two}} winning seasons and {{were unable to}} advance to the playoffs. During this period the team also traded away quarterback Fran Tarkenton, who would later lead the Minnesota Vikings to three Super Bowls and end up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> of Fame. This period was characterized by the front office's bad decisions in the college draft, several ill-advised trades, and the team's fans' growing disappointment. It was not until the 1980s that the Giants would develop a consistent playoff team.|$|E
