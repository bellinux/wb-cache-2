Anatolia has always been considered as a ‘bridge-land’ between Europe, Asia and Africa, and undoubtedly {{played a central role}} in the main human migratory fluxes across Eurasia and the birth and development of ancient <b>innovative</b> <b>societies.</b> Here, results of a recent ancient DNA (aDNA) study from a Byzantine population in southwest Anatolia will be discussed. This study made possible to detect the maternal genetic signature of some major historical and prehistorical events in ancient Anatolia. Secondly, novel aDNA data of pigs from various Anatolian archeological sites spanning the Early Neolithic to the Medieval era will be introduced. The long chronological sequence of this study allows reconstructing a timeframe within which the main population movements and socio-economical changes in the Anatolian region are documented. status: publishe...|$|E

We found that a highly <b>innovative</b> <b>society</b> is not characterized by heavy concentration in highly valued ideas: Rather, ideas are more broadly distributed in a more <b>innovative</b> <b>society</b> with faster progress, provided that the rate of adoption is constant, which suggests a positive correlation between innovation and technological disparity. Furthermore, the distribution is generally skewed {{in such a way that}} the fraction of innovators is substantially smaller than has been believed in conventional innovation-diffusion theory based on normality. Thus, the typical adoption pattern is predicted to be asymmetric with slow saturation in the ideal situation, which is compared with empirical data sets. Comment: 11 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In a {{world that}} is not predictable, improvisation, evolution, and {{innovation}} are more than luxuries: they are necessities. The challenge of design {{is not a matter of}} getting rid of the emergent, but rather of including it and making it an opportunity for more creative and more adequate solutions to problems. End-user development (EUD) provides the enabling conditions for putting owners of problems in charge by defining the technical and social conditions for broad participation in design activities. It addresses the challenges of fostering new mindsets, new sources of creativity, and cultural changes to create foundations for <b>innovative</b> <b>societies.</b> Grounded in the analysis of previous research activities this paper explores (1) conceptual frameworks for EUD (including: socio-technical environments; metadesign; and cultures of participation), (2) models guiding and supporting EUD (including: the seeding, evolutionary growth, reseeding process model; Model-Authoritative and Model-Democratic for knowledge creation, accumulation, and sharing; and richer ecologies of participation). These frameworks and models are briefly illustrated in one specific application domain. The paper concludes by articulating design guidelines and design-tradeoffs to shape the future of EUD being understood as a cultural transformation rather than only as a technology to create software artifacts...|$|E
40|$|Immigration {{represents}} {{one of the most significant}} phenomena of our contemporary society. Therefore, the study of its related issues is an extremely rich research field, which involves different subjects and aims at understanding this phenomenon from a number of aspects. For this reason, the activities carried out by individual researchers, or more often by working groups, are numerous. Full awareness and comprehension of the unprecedented transformations in a demographic, social, economic and, ultimately, territorial context, which in an increasingly globalized and interdependent world are being experienced across contemporary Europe, and in particular across Italy, may help support and promote inclusive and <b>innovative</b> <b>societies.</b> As regards Geography, which has been examining this phenomenon for a long time, it would be desirable to see a renewal of its commitment and avenues of research through the rediscovery of a disciplinary collective result that over time has undergone fragmentation in order to meet the incessant demand for specialization. Thus, this paper will examine some key concepts involved in migration issues, which will be investigated in terms of geography. Moreover, there will be the examination of new scenarios for research and perspective, as well as the discussion of a research project, which is still a work-in-progress...|$|E

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{of the size of}} the biomedical sectors in Australia and Canada 12 As countries, Canada and Australia have much in common. There is a shared heritage as new world British colonies and accordingly a similar culture, governmental institutions, living conditions, health and educational standards. Australia is somewhat smaller than Canada- its population of about 20 m is 61 % of Canada’s. Both have high living standards although Canada’s GDP per capita is marginally higher than Australia’s. The countries also share many aspirations. One is to retain their technological edge, as <b>innovative</b> <b>societies,</b> through the commercialisation of their science base. Little could illustrate this better than the release, within the space of a few months, of innovation strategies designed to enhance the innovation process in each country. In Australia’s case, its plan was set out in Backing Australia’s Ability (DEST 2001), which followed a number of related reports and white papers, and for Canada, the more substantial document Achieving Excellence (Government of Canada 2002). This provided not only a detailed analysis and assessment of Canada’s innovation performance, but also identified quantifiable targets to guide future action by government and industry. Both documents focussed on similar things, strengthening R&D, accelerating its commercial application and developing and retaining skills. They also emphasised the importance of broader supportive and competitive economic settings. In both cases, the governments ’ policy initiatives were accompanied by substantial increases in government funding for R&D and associated support programs. Overall Canada’s and Australia’s R&D performance has been fairly similar. Over many years, Canada and Australia have sat within one country ranking of each other on the OECD table of R&D to GDP ratios.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} “Engage 2020 Project” 1 is {{to promote}} the use of {{engagement}} methods and policies that support societal engagement in research and innovation by mapping what is practiced and spreading awareness of the opportunities amongst researchers, policy makers, and other interested parties. The project is tasked with scanning existing policies and activities, structures, methods, approaches, tools and instruments, as well as highlighting promising new or adapted approaches for the future. This report includes results of the scanning process on current praxis of policies and activities that support societal engagement in research and innovation in Europe and beyond. Desktop research and interviews, done by all partners of the Engage 2020 consortium, were the main methods used to collect data. Overall, information and data on around 200 policies and activities that support societal engagement in research and innovation activities was collected and documented {{in the form of}} factsheets. After further analysis and verification, 124 factsheets that form the basis for analysis in this report were selected. The report focuses on policies and activities that support the engagement of societal actors in research and innovation. Specifically, the following actors were considered: Civil Society Organizations (CSOs), citizens, affected populations, consumers, employees, users, and others. These can be engaged at {{one or more of the}} different levels of research and innovation process: policy formation, programme development, project definition and research and innovation activity. Furthermore, this engagement could take place in relation to one or more of the seven Grand Challenges identified by the European Commission: health and demographic change, food security and sustainable agriculture, clean and efficient energy, green transport, climate change and resource efficiency, inclusive and <b>innovative</b> <b>societies,</b> and security. Results show that there is developing support for societal engagement in research and innovation activities at all four levels of the research and innovation process. Moreover, we found that there is growing interest at the European Union level to engage citizens in research and innovation activities. A total of 46 cases at this level were reviewed. At the national level, our results show that societal engagement was more prevalent in the Western European countries than in the Central and Eastern European countries. At the international level, we found strong policy support for societal engagement in North America and Canada. Only a few such cases were found in Africa and Asia. We cannot claim to have exhausted all the available policies and activities that support the engagement of societal actors in research and innovation activities in Europe and beyond. However, the results showed that there are many good examples of policies and activities that support societal engagement. These could be used as building blocks to further support societal engagement throughout Europe. The results also showed that there are several gaps and barriers that need to be filled and addressed for societal engagement to achieve its intended outcomes. Several barriers to societal engagement such as lack of time and resources, training and skills, poor infrastructure, as well as lack of evaluation and an underdeveloped culture of engagement are also highlighted. These and other gaps in the research and innovation process have the potentials to interfere with the quality and quantity of engagement processes. Overall, we found that most of the examples given in this report could be used as a source of inspiration for those interested in developing or using supportive policies for societal engagement in research and innovation. Many policies and activities could support engagement at one or more levels of the research and innovation process and most could be used in stimulating engagement for any Grand Challenge related research or innovative activity. 1 [URL]...|$|E

At present it functions best as a learning support tool. M-devices are still in the first generation and their full pedagogical potential is yet to be explored, but it appears that m-learning is on the edge of becoming an exciting educational alternative. M-learning developed in response to the great popularity of m-devices in our hi-tech society, especially among the young. It also has promise as an option for providing continuing education and training for adults; an important area since upgrading of work skills is increasingly demanded by employers in a rapidly <b>innovative</b> <b>society.</b> Moreover, education has become “life-long” and with increased leisure people are interested in self-improvement learning.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the contemporary}} Russian innovation policy and innovation system, and posits that Russia needs to overcome considerable barriers {{in order for}} it to become a sound <b>innovative</b> <b>society.</b> After its transformation, Russia changed its innovation policy from government-led to market-led. In the midst of weakened international competitiveness and economic decline, however, its policy has spontaneously changed to one of 'governmentalization', showing path-dependent evolution. Throughout the 2000 s, the government introduced a succession of innovation modernization programs, but the results appear limited, and the macroeconomic indicators explain how the country continues to be mired by its traditional backwardness, as evidenced by its heavy dependence on energy exports, poor high technology exports, outdated equipment, and other such factors. As a theoretical framework for understanding the <b>innovative</b> <b>society,</b> I apply the 'market quality theory', in that market quality determines the content of innovation institutions and barriers they face. Market quality can be measured by institutional arrangements (infrastructure, strength of the 'rule of game', and its enforcement), institutional complementarities, and transaction costs. The specificity of the Russian market indirectly characterizes its weakness in market quality, as seen in international rankings such as the Global Competitiveness Index, Corruption Index, and so on. Thus, Russia's innovation institutions have their specificities and instabilities, and owing to the weak market quality, misuse of institutions, and government failure, its innovation policy has become 'govemmentalized' instead of following the path of marketization with high quality. Market quality and state/government quality {{are one and the}} same. The quality of its state/government is poor owing to its present form of governance and social mistrust. In order to overcome these barriers, I stress on the need for social innovation as a key measure for enhancing the quality of the market/state...|$|R

After reviewing the reasoning on competences and skills, prioritized in the academic language in recent years, it can be stated that, for the sake of employability of students and graduates, the educational vision of learning should maintain its hegemony in the philosophy of action to follow. Internationalization is emphasized and theoretical dearth is addressed in relation to the connection between education performance and the labor market, without setting aside, obviously, the connection between employability and civil society organizations.

40|$|Abstract: Innovation, a broad {{social and}} {{economic}} activity within the emerging learning societies, transcends any specific technology, even if revolutionary, and is tied to attitudes and behaviours oriented towards the exploitation of change by adding value. We analyse the on-going Portuguese path towards an <b>innovative</b> <b>society.</b> We start by characterizing innovation in Portugal within the European context. To better understand this case study, we introduce the analysis of innovation over time and across space, inspired by the techno-economic paradigms approach. This leads us to conceptualise “learning ” {{and the process of}} knowledge accumulation, as a framework to understand the new demands for being inno vative. We conclude by suggesting elements for innovation policies for Portugal, arguing for the need to promote systems of innovation and competence building based on learning and knowledge networks.
