These experiments extend the work by Geller et al.

Focusing {{on the problem}} which power plant flue <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>content</b> is hard to predict efficiently, an intelligent hybrid prediction method is proposed. First, the RBF neural network and principal component analysis method are utilized to reduce the dimension of the input variables. Second, the case-based reasoning method is carried on to predict the flue <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>content</b> based on the above analysis results. Then, in order to reflect {{the cumulative effect of}} the flue <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>content</b> with time, the GM (1, 1) grey prediction method is used to predict the current flue <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>content</b> value. Finally, the final flue <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>content</b> is obtained by the variance-covariance method of weight combination forecasting. Simulations and industrial results show that the proposed intelligent hybrid prediction model has high accuracy and robustness, and can solve the problem of predicting the flue <b>gas</b> oxygen <b>content</b> effectively...|$|R

5|$|The {{body of a}} teleost is denser than water, so fish must {{compensate}} for the difference or they will sink. Many teleosts have a swim bladder that adjusts their buoyancy through manipulation of gases {{to allow them to}} stay at the current water depth, or ascend or descend without having to waste energy in swimming. In the more primitive groups like some minnows, the swim bladder is open to the esophagus and doubles as a lung. It is often absent in fast-swimming fishes such as the tuna and mackerel. In fish where the swim bladder is closed, the <b>gas</b> <b>content</b> is controlled through the rete mirabilis, a network of blood vessels serving as a countercurrent gas exchanger between the swim bladder and the blood. The Chondrostei such as sturgeons also have a swim bladder, but this appears to have evolved separately: other Actinopterygii such as the bowfin and the bichir do not have one, so swim bladders appear to have arisen twice, and the teleost swim bladder is not homologous with the chondrostean one.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFor {{many years}} flow-rate, temperature, ions and <b>gases</b> <b>content</b> data have been {{collected}} from a natural spring located in the Koryakskiy volcano area (Kamchatka, Russia). We have investigated {{the correlations between the}} hydrogeochemical data and the areal seismicity represented by the k s values (k s is a function of magnitude and hypocentral distance) of the earthquakes. At first we smoothed the raw hydrogeochemical data using a semi-triangle weight function. Then we compared the trends of each smoothed hydrogeochemical parameter with the k s trend using a running cross-correlation function with a maximum lag of ± 30 days and the main result was that, sometimes, we found 0. 7 ? 0. 4 cross-correlation coefficients with no lag for flow rate and with + (10 ? 15) days lags for some ion and <b>gas</b> <b>contents.</b> The correlation is positive, i. e. flow rate and ion and <b>gas</b> <b>contents</b> increase when k s increases. This phenomenology could be explained by an underground water pumping produced by some earthquake. We advance the hypothesis that this pumping could be the response of the viscoelastic underground medium of the Koryakskiy volcano to seismic waves. So, sometimes, the supply of elastic energy of the earthquakes may provide the trigger to a catastrophic nucleation of bubbles of this material producing a new melt with a lower density which will tend to expand and cause a pressure increase. This pressure produces a more intensive circulation of underground water and an anomalous increase of the flow rate and subsequently anomalous increases in groundwater ions and <b>gases</b> <b>content...</b>|$|R

Diffusion would decrease the 3 He/ 4 He ration below that of the solar wind, which is not observed (Nagao et al. [2011]). After gas loss or low accumulation of noble gases during an episode of elevated surface temperatures, replenishing of the low-temperature (shallowly implanted) noble <b>gas</b> <b>contents</b> may occur rapidly on time scales of a few hundred years.
