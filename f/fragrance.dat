40|$|<b>Fragranced</b> {{consumer}} products, such as cleaning supplies, air fresheners, {{and personal}} care products, are {{a primary source}} of indoor air pollutants and personal exposure. Previous research indicates that <b>fragranced</b> products can trigger adverse health effects, with implications for workplaces and public places. This is the first study to examine the multiple dimensions of exposures related to <b>fragranced</b> products and effects in the US population. The study investigated the prevalence and types of <b>fragranced</b> product exposures, associated health effects, awareness of product emissions, and preferences for fragrance-free policies and environments. Data were collected using an online survey with a nationally representative population (n =  1136) of adults in the USA. Overall, 34. 7  % of the population reported health problems, such as migraine headaches and respiratory difficulties, when exposed to <b>fragranced</b> products. Further, 15. 1  % have lost workdays or a job due to <b>fragranced</b> product exposure in the workplace. Also, 20. 2  % would enter a business but then leave {{as quickly as possible}} if they smell air fresheners or some <b>fragranced</b> product. Over 50  % of the population would prefer that workplaces, health care facilities and professionals, hotels, and airplanes were fragrance-free. While prior research found that common <b>fragranced</b> products, even those called green and organic, emitted hazardous air pollutants, more than two thirds of the population were not aware of this, and over 60  % would not continue to use a <b>fragranced</b> product if they knew it emitted such pollutants. Results from this study provide strong evidence that <b>fragranced</b> products can trigger adverse health effects in the general population. The study also indicates that reducing exposure to <b>fragranced</b> products, such as through fragrance-free policies, can provide cost-effective and relatively simple ways to reduce risks and improve air quality and health.
