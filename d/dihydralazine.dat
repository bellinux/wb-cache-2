40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} intravenous <b>dihydralazine</b> with ketanserin {{in the management of}} severe hypertension in the third trimester. Study design: A double blind randomised controlled trial, comparing 5 mg <b>dihydralazine</b> with 10 mg ketanserin after an intravenous infusion of 500 ml of a crystalloid solution. Medication was repeated every 20 min till the therapeutic goal of 90 mm Hg was reached, to a maximum of 4 dosages. Main outcome measures were treatment failures and emergency deliveries for fetal distress. Results: The therapeutic goal was met more often in patients receiving <b>dihydralazine</b> (36 / 38 compared to 27 / 42; P< 0. 01). The need for delivery for fetal distress did not differ (3 after <b>dihydralazine,</b> 1 after ketanserin, P= 0. 29). No therapy related perinatal loss occurred, but one mother with an undiagnosed phaechromocytoma died 24 h after receiving <b>dihydralazine.</b> Conclusion: Ketanserin in this dosage is less effective to lower diastolic blood pressure. The place of a fluid load prior to <b>dihydralazine</b> needs to be further investigated, as fetal heart rate decelerations were less common-than previously reported. Articl...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © Walter de GruyterObjective: To compare {{maternal}} and perinatal outcome {{with the use}} of either intravenous ketanserin or <b>dihydralazine</b> in treatment of women with preeclampsia. Methods: The records from January 1989 to January 1997 of all patients receiving intravenous ketanserin or <b>dihydralazine</b> as first line antihypertensive therapy were reviewed and standardized data forms were completed. 315 charts of patients were identified and evaluated for effects on blood pressure, laboratory parameters, {{maternal and}} perinatal outcome. Results: During the study interval 169 patients received ketanserin and 146 <b>dihydralazine.</b> Significantly fewer antepartum (27 % versus 38 %, p = 0. 04) and postpartum (25 % versus 39 %, p = 0. 01) maternal complications were noted in patients receiving ketanserin. Occurrence of HELLP syndrome was significantly lower among patients who received ketanserin (20 %) than among those who received <b>dihydralazine</b> (40 %, p = 0. 0001). Side-effects were reported with significantly higher frequency in patients receiving <b>dihydralazine</b> (60 %) as compared to those receiving ketanserin (17 %, p < 0. 0001). Perinatal outcome was comparable, however, umbilical cord arterial pH values (mean ± SD) were higher with ketanserin compared to <b>dihydralazine</b> (7. 25 ± 0. 07 vs 7. 23 ± 0. 09, p = 0. 038). The incidence of placental abruption was higher in patients receiving <b>dihydralazine</b> (5. 5 %) versus those receiving ketanserin (0. 6 %, p = 0. 014). Conclusion: Ketanserin appears to be a better option than <b>dihydralazine</b> for treatment of severe preeclampsia since fewer maternal complications and side-effects were observed in patients receiving ketanserin.

40|$|AbstractProgression {{of chronic}} kidney disease remains a {{principal}} problem in clinical nephrology {{and there is a}} pressing need for novel therapeutics and biomarkers. Aberrant promoter CpG island methylation and subsequent transcriptional silencing of specific genes have emerged as contributors to progression of {{chronic kidney disease}}. Here, we report that transcriptional silencing of the Ras-GTP suppressor RASAL 1 contributes causally to progression of kidney fibrosis and we identified that circulating methylated RASAL 1 promoter DNA fragments in peripheral blood correspond with levels of intrarenal levels of RASAL 1 promoter methylation and degree of fibrosis in kidney biopsies, enabling non-invasive longitudinal analysis of intrarenal CpG island methylation. Retrospective analysis of patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis revealed that circulating methylated RASAL 1 promoter DNA fragments in peripheral blood decrease with <b>Dihydralazine</b> treatment in patients with hypertensive nephrosclerosis, and provided evidence that low-dose <b>Dihydralazine</b> delays decline of excretory kidney function, whereas <b>Dihydralazine</b> at standard doses had no protective effect. We demonstrate that the protective effect of <b>Dihydralazine</b> is due to induction of endogenous Tet 3 /Tdg-mediated DNA-de-methylation activity reversing aberrant promoter CpG island methylation, while HIF 1 α induction at standard doses counterbalances its protective activity. We conclude that RASAL 1 promoter methylation is a therapeutic target and a biomarker of renal fibrosis. Our study suggests that therapeutic use of low-dose <b>Dihydralazine</b> in patients with chronic kidney disease and fibrosis deserves further consideration...|$|E
40|$|Patients with <b>dihydralazine</b> {{hepatotoxicity}} {{have been}} found to have circulating autoantibodies that react with liver microsomes (anti-liver microsome antibodies) and that are clearly distinct from anti-liver and kidney microsomal antibodies observed in patients with tienilic acid-induced hepatitis and in some patients with autoimmune hepatitis. The authors show that anti-liver microsome antibodies present in the sera of five patients with dihydralazine-induced hepatitis specifically react on immunoblots with a 53 kD protein. They further conclude that this target antigen is the phase I drug metabolizing enzyme termed P- 450 IA 2 based on the following observations: (a) immunoblots of a battery of human liver microsomes produced the identical pattern of relative staining whether the blots were developed with anti-rat P- 450 IA 2 IgG, anti-human P- 450 IA 2 IgG or each of the five patients' sera; (b) P- 450 IA 2 catalytic activity was selectively inhibited when human liver microsomes were preincubated with anti-liver microsome-positive sera; (c) anti-liver microsome-positive sera identified purified human P- 450 IA 2 on immunoblots. Anti-liver microsome antibodies appeared to be specific for <b>dihydralazine</b> hepatitis because they were not present in sera obtained from 28 other patients including patients receiving <b>dihydralazine</b> without a toxic response and patients with other significant liver diseases. Finally, the authors demonstrated that <b>dihydralazine</b> could competitively inhibit catalytic activity characteristic of P- 450 IA 2 in human liver microsomes, suggesting that P- 450 IA 2 may be involved in the metabolism of <b>dihydralazine...</b>|$|E

40|$|When {{administered}} to young spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), <b>dihydralazine</b> (25 mg kg- 1, daily) and captopril (100 mg kg- 1, daily) prevent {{with the same}} efficacy genetic hypertension development (GHD). <b>Dihydralazine</b> treatment increased vascular mesenteric compliance, as shown by {{a significant decrease in}} the stiffness of the vessels (- 27 %), and induced slight reductions in contractility (- 12 %) and in wall to lumen (W/L) ratio (- 15 %). After treatment withdrawal, all these parameters returned to control values within 7 weeks, as did blood pressure. Captopril treatment also strongly increased the mesenteric vessels compliance, vessel stiffness being decreased by 16 %, and reduced their contractility (- 15 %) and their W/L ratio (- 30 %). These effects as well as those exerted on blood pressure persisted up to 7 weeks after treatment ceased although there was a slight trend to a progressive reduction in the intensity of both phenomena. These experiments show that captopril but not <b>dihydralazine</b> has a long-lasting effect in opposing the functional and morphological vascular alterations occurring during GHD in SHRs and this phenomenon probably contributes to a large extent to the sustained preventive effects of the drug against GHD...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of a pure afterload reduction on systolic time intervals and various echocardiographic indices was assessed in six healthy volunteers, who underwent a single blind placebo controlled trial of three regimens of intravenous <b>dihydralazine</b> (6. 25, 12. 5, and 25. 0 mg). Subsequently autonomic blockade (propranolol and atropine) was used to eliminate the {{influence of}} the autonomic reflex action during dosage with <b>dihydralazine</b> 6. 25 mg. <b>Dihydralazine</b> increased heart rate to an extent depending on dose, decreased diastolic blood pressure, end systolic diameter, and end systolic wall stress, and enhanced fractional shortening and cardiac output. Heart rate corrected pre-ejection period was shortened and left ventricular ejection time was prolonged, whereas electromechanical systole remained virtually unchanged. Autonomic blockade eliminated dihydralazine's effect on heart rate and cardiac output; blood pressure and systolic wall stress fell appreciably, whereas dihydralazine-induced changes in the systolic time intervals were virtually unaffected. Thus the present study indicates that regardless of the autonomic reflexes heart rate corrected pre-ejection period and left ventricular ejection time, but not electromechanical systole, are highly dependent on afterload, and this effect should be considered when systolic time intervals are evaluated...|$|E

These anti-LM antibodies were different from anti-liver/kidney microsomes (anti-LKM) 1 or 2 autoantibodies which have been previously described. Sera recognized a single 53, 000 = Mr polypeptide in human liver microsomes as judged by immunoblotting, and the target antigen was identified as cytochrome P- 450 IA 2 (P- 450 IA 2) by (a) comparison of immunoblotting patterns with anti-human P- 450 IA 2 and anti-rat P- 450 IA 2 and with five anti-LM sera, and (b) specific immunoinhibition of microsomal ethoxyresorufin and phenacetin O-deethylation activities (both P- 450 IA 2 supported reactions) by anti-LM antibodies. Finally, purified human P- 450 IA 2 was recognized by these anti-LM sera.

40|$|Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) {{was used}} to study skin blood flow in the finger tip and on the dorsum of the hand in healthy volunteers. Vasodilatation in the finger tip was induced by {{immersing}} the arm in water at 42 degrees C, and vasodilatation in the dorsum of the hand by intracutaneous injection of <b>dihydralazine.</b> Simultaneous measurements were performed using venous occlusion plethysmography (finger tip) and 133 Xe clearance (dorsum of hand). Three output signals from the laser Doppler flowmeter were recorded. The LDFPf- 1 value is linearly related to the blood flow, provided the concentration of blood cells in the scattering volume is low. The LDFPf- 2 value is generated by a signal processor designed to give linearity even at higher concentrations of moving blood cells (CMBC), the latter quantity being reflected by the CMBC value. During vasodilatation by immersion, all laser Doppler values from the finger tip increased but less than the total finger blood flow as measured using venous occlusion plethysmography. Intracutaneous injection of <b>dihydralazine</b> in the dorsum of the hand caused markedly increased CMBC values {{and the increase in}} LDFPf- 2 was significantly greater than that of LDFPf- 1. The increase in 133 Xe clearance was less pronounced. The results indicate that capillary blood flow as well as blood flow in vessels below the capillary level contribute to the Doppler signal. However, flow through the arteriovenous shunts in the finger tip seems to be only partially registered by the laser Doppler technique. The higher the CMBC value, the more obvious is the difference between LDFPf- 1 and LDFPf- 2 values. When using laser Doppler flowmetry, the addition of CMBC value registration may be helpful in clarifying changes in microvascular blood flow...|$|E

40|$|Elevated {{levels of}} {{reactive}} α,β-unsaturated aldehydes (e. g. malondialdehyde, 4 -hydroxynonenal and acrolein) {{in the affected}} tissues of various degenerative conditions suggest these substances are active propagators of the disease process. One experimental approach to attenuating damage by these intermediates employs ‘aldehyde-sequestering drugs’ as sacrificial nucleophiles, thereby sparing cell macromolecules and perhaps slowing disease progression. Drugs with demonstrated trapping activity toward lipid-derived aldehydes include various amine compounds such as aminoguanidine, carnosine and pyridoxamine. We have focused on identifying scavengers of acrolein, perhaps the most toxic aldehyde formed during lipid peroxidation cascades.

40|$|SUMMARY Since {{systolic}} pressure {{is governed by}} the rate of ventricular ejection and the rigidity of the aortic wall, antihypertensive agents may have different effects on systolic and diastolic pressure. Despite an adequate decrease in diastolic pressure, {{systolic pressure}} may remain elevated due to structural alterations of large arteries. In the present study, a procedure is described to distinguish the dilation of small and large arteries. The former is evaluated from the calculation of forearm resistance and the latter from {{the determination of the}} arterial diameter of the brachial artery, using a bidimen-sional pulsed Doppler system. Nitroglycerin dilates the brachial artery, with no change in forearm resistance. <b>Dihydralazine</b> reduces the diameter of the brachial artery but decreases forearm resis-tance. Only calcium and converting-enzyme inhibitors dilate both small and large arteries and cause an increase in brachial blood flow.

40|$|SUMMARY We {{performed}} simultaneous noninvasive {{measurements of}} common carotid artery and brachial artery hemodynamics in nine normal subjects and 10 subjects with sustained essential hypertension. In hypertensive subjects, brachial artery blood flow and forearm vascular resistance {{were in the}} normal range while carotid artery blood flow and carotid artery resistance were decreased and increased, respectively. The most important findings were {{the changes in the}} internal caliber of large arteries. Although the brachial and carotid artery diameters of hypertensive subjects were measured for the same level of mean arterial pressure, brachial artery diameter was significantly increased and carotid artery diameter was strictly normal as compared with values found in normal subjects. To assess whether carotid artery circulation could influence the baroreceptor reflex response to arteriolar vasodilation, carotid artery and brachial artery hemodynamics were measured in imme-diate succession in normotensive and hypertensive subjects before and after oral administration of cadralazine, a <b>dihydralazine</b> derivative. After cadralazine treatment, carotid artery tangential ten-sion decreased in hypertensive subjects, and the changes were significantly correlated to the Increase in heart rate.

40|$|Most {{agree that}} {{antihypertensive}} medication {{should be used}} to treat severe hypertension during pregnancy, but its role in patients with mild to moderate disease is debated. None of the regularly used drugs is completely safe for mother and fetus. Ketanserin decreases systolic and diastolic blood pressure in nonpregnant patients with acute and chronic hypertension. Its selective serotonin S 2 -receptor antagonist activity encouraged investigations into a possible role in pregnant women. These reports can be divided into four groups. Several studies confirmed that intravenous ketanserin decreases blood pressure significantly in patients with severe preeclampsia.

Its role in chronic hypertension has not been studied adequately, but one randomized, controlled trial indicated efficacy comparable with that of alpha-methyldopa.

40|$|Background Pre-eclampsia is a multisystem disorder, {{peculiar}} to and frequent in human pregnancy. It remains a {{leading cause of}} maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Hemodynamic disturbances are the most prominent features of the syndrome. Purpose To provide an overview of plasma volume regulation and blood pressure control mechanisms outside pregnancy, and of the changes in normal pregnancies and in pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disorders. Furthermore, to discuss the rationale of several hemodynamic interventions. Results In normal pregnancy, large cardiovascular changes take place. A generalized fall in vascular tone by systemic vasorelaxation causes increased blood volume, heart rate and cardiac output. In the preclinical phase, differences have been observed between normal and hypertensive pregnancies in the function of the autonomic nervous system, cardiac output and plasma volume, the volume remaining at the non-pregnant level. In the clinical phase of pre-eclampsia the typical case picture is one of a vasoconstrictive state with low plasma volume and cardiac output high blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance in combination with signs of organ damage [proteinuria, hemolysis elevated liver enzymes low platelets (HELLP) syndrome]. Hemodynamic management is necessary in severe disease to prevent maternal complications. Management primarily focuses on pharmacological treatment of blood pressure. Clinicians make educated choices from a limited array of available drugs: P-receptor antagonists, nifedipine, <b>dihydralazine,</b> methyldopa or ketanserine. Other drugs have restricted use in pregnancy. Management of low circulating volume with plasma expanders remains a subject of controvers...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{establish}} {{the effects of}} plasma volume expansion (PVE) followed by intravenous <b>dihydralazine</b> (DH) administration on maternal whole blood viscosity (WBV) and hematocrit, uteroplacental and fetoplacental downstream impedance and umbilical venous (UV) volume flow in pre-eclampsia. METHODS: In 13 pre-eclamptic women maternal and fetal hemodynamics were established by means of combined measurement of maternal arterial blood pressure (BP), WBV, hematocrit and uterine artery (UtA) resistance index (RI) in addition to umbilical artery (UA) pulsatility index (PI) and UV volume flow obtained from UV vessel area and UV time-averaged flow velocity. In each woman all parameters were measured four times at baseline, after PVE, after DH and 24 h {{after the start of}} treatment. RESULTS: Maternal diastolic BP, hematocrit and WBV display a significant reduction after PVE. In the fetus UA PI decreases significantly whereas a significant increase in UV cross-sectional area was detected. After maternal DH administration, arterial systolic and diastolic BP and UA PI show a significant decrease compared with the measurements following PVE. At 24 h, only maternal systolic and diastolic BP display a significant further decrease. No significant changes were established for the UtA RI, UV time-averaged velocity and UV volume flow during the entire study period. CONCLUSIONS: During pre-eclampsia, maternal PVE followed by DH administration results in a significant reduction in maternal diastolic BP, maternal hematocrit and WBV. Maternal PVE is associated with a significant increase in UV cross-sectional area and a non-significant rise of 11 % in UV volume flow. Maternal DH administration does not result in any change in UV cross-sectional area. However, UA PI decreases significantly after both PVE and DH treatment...|$|E

In the rat anti-Thy 1. 1 mesangioproliferative nephritis inhibition of VEGF- 165 impairs glomerular endothelial repair. We now studied {{the effects of}} systemic overexpression of hVEGF- 165 during glomerular endothelial damage in this model. Hepatic gene transfer was performed by tail vein injection of a human VEGF- 165 expression plasmid or LacZ control vector 24 hours prior to induction of anti-Thy 1. 1 -nephritis. Rats receiving high dose VEGF- 165 (800 µg plasmid; serum levels at 48 h 762 +/- 434 pg/ml vs. < 30 pg/ml in LacZ rats) showed generalized edema and transient hypotension on days 0 and 1, whereas LacZ treated animals remained normotensive. On days 2 and/or 6 after disease induction, mesangiolysis, glomerular cell proliferation and glomerular monocyte/macrophage infiltration was significantly increased in high dose VEGF- 165 rats vs. LacZ rats. Proteinuria on day 6 was 142 +/- 29 mg/d (VEGF- 165) vs. 66 +/- 41 mg/d (LacZ). Aggravation of glomerular injury was not due to altered anti-Thy 1. 1 antibody binding after VEGF 165 gene transfer. Rather, a <b>dihydralazine</b> treated control group with sham gene transfer showed that systemic hypotension per se augmented glomerular injury. However, hepatic overexpression of 8 -fold lower VEGF doses in anti-Thy 1. 1 -nephritis also resulted in augmented damage on day 2 and failed to improve glomerular histology on day 6. In summary, contrary to our expectation, VEGF- 165 overexpression during early anti-Thy 1. 1 nephritis augmented glomerular injury, possibly mediated by systemic hypotension and/or uncoordinated endothelial repair. These findings raise important safety concerns in cases of systemic VEGF therapy and concomittant mesangiolytic injury...|$|E
40|$|Cytochromes P 450 (CYPs) and UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) are {{targets of}} autoantibodies in several hepatic and extrahepatic {{autoimmune}} diseases. Autoantibodies directed against hepatic CYPs and UGTs were first detected by indirect immunofluorescence as antiliver and/or kidney microsomal antibodies. In autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) type 2, liver and/or kidney microsomal (LKM) type 1 autoantibodies are detected and are directed against CYP 2 D 6. About 10 % of AIH- 2 sera further contain LKM- 3 autoantibodies directed against family  1 UGTs. Chronic infections by hepatitis C virus and {{hepatitis delta virus}} may induce several autoimmune phenomena, and multiple autoantibodies are detected. Anti-CYP 2 D 6 autoantibodies are detected in up to 4 % of patients with chronic hepatitis C, and anti-CYP 2 A 6 autoantibodies are detected in about 2 % of these patients. In contrast, 14 % of patients with chronic hepatitis delta virus infections generate anti-UGT autoantibodies. In {{a small minority of}} patients, certain drugs are known to induce immune-mediated, idiosyncratic drug reactions, also known as ’drug-induced hepatitis’. Drug-induced hepatitis is often associated with autoantibodies directed against hepatic CYPs or other hepatic proteins. Typical examples are tienilic acid-induced hepatitis with anti-CYP 2 C 9, <b>dihydralazine</b> hepatitis with anti-CYP 1 A 2, halothane hepatitis with anti-CYP 2 E 1 and anticonvulsant hepatitis with anti-CYP 3 A. Recent data suggest that alcoholic liver disease may be induced by mechanisms similar to those that are active in drug-induced hepatitis. Autoantibodies directed against several CYPs are further detected in sera from patients with the autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1. Patients with autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 with hepatitis often develop anti-CYP 1 A 2; patients with adrenal failure develop anti-CYP 21, anti- CYP 11 A 1 or CYP 17; and patients with gonadal failure develop anti-CYP 11 A 1 or CYP 17. In idiopathic Addison disease, CYP 21 is the major autoantigen...|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A 4 is {{not only}} the most {{abundant}} isoform in human liver but also metabolizes approximately 60 % of the therapeutic drugs. This feature renders CYP 3 A 4 highly susceptible to both reversible and irreversible (mechanism-based) inhibition. The latter is characterized by NADPH-, time- and concentration-dependent enzyme inactivation, occurring when some drugs are converted by CYPs to reactive metabolites. Mechanism-based inactivation of CYP 3 A 4 by drugs can be due to the chemical modification of the heme, the protein, or both as a result of covalent binding of modified heme to the protein. The clinical pharmacokinetic effect of a CYP 3 A 4 inactivator is a function of its KI, kinact and partition ratio and the synthesis rate of new or replacement enzyme. Predicting drug-drug interactions involving CYP 3 A 4 inactivation is possible when proper pharmacokinetic principles are followed. However, the prediction may become difficult, since the clinical outcomes due to CYP 3 A 4 inactivation depend on many factors associated with the enzyme, drugs and the patients. A number of clinically important drugs have been identified to be mechanism-based CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors. These include antibiotics (e. g. erythromycin and isoniazid), anticancer drugs (e. g. tamoxifen), antidepressants (e. g. fluoxetine and midazolam), anti-HIV agents (e. g. ritonavir and delavirdine), antihypertensives (e. g. <b>dihydralazine</b> and verapamil), steroids and their receptor modulators (e. g. gestodene and raloxifene), and some herbal constituents (e. g. bergamottin and glabridin). Compared to reversible inhibition, mechanism- based inhibitors of CYP 3 A 4 more frequently cause unfavorable drug-drug interactions, as the inactivated CYP 3 A 4 has to be replaced by newly synthesized CYP 3 A 4 protein. Most CYP 3 A 4 inactivators are also PgP substrates/inhibitors, confounding the in vitro-in vivo extrapolation. Clinicians should have good knowledge on these CYP 3 A 4 inactivators and avoid their combination use...|$|E
40|$|Background: Pregnancy-induced {{hypertension}} (PIH) {{is possibly}} {{caused by an}} increased activity of the sympatic nervous system. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} inhibition of the re-uptake of serotonin and norepinephrine by selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) could contribute to this increased activity. Objectives: To assess the association between the use of antidepressants (ADs) and the development of pregnancyinduced hypertension. Methods: Using the prescription database IADB. nl we conducted a case-control study among pregnant women between 1995 and 2012. Cases were defined as> 1 dispensed prescription of an antihypertensive drug (methyldopa, <b>dihydralazine,</b> ketanserin, labetalol, nifidepine) after 20 weeks of gestation. Controls were matched for age at time of giving birth. Only first and singleton pregnancies of women not using any antihypertensive drug during 6 months before pregnancy till 20 weeks of gestation were included. Exposure was defined as> 1 dispensed prescription of an antidepressant during pregnancy. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and their corresponding 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). Subanalyses were conducted for class of AD (TCA, SSRI, other) and duration of AD use (1 - 30, ≥ 31 Defined Daily Doses (DDDs)). As the exact duration of gestation was unknown, all analysis were conducted for 3 theoretical gestational ages (36, 38, 40 weeks). Results: A total of 312 PIH cases and 12480 controls were included in the analysis (gestational age 36 weeks). The exposure rate among case and control pregnancies was 3. 2 % and 1. 5 % respectively. The use of AD increased the risk for developing PIH more than twice (OR [95 % CI] 2. 24 [1. 17 - 4. 27]). Significant associations (OR [95 % CI]) were also found for the subgroups TCA (3. 39 [1. 04 - 11. 08]), SSRI (2. 23 [1. 03 - 4. 81]) and ≥ 31 DDDs (2. 38 [1. 16 - 4. 90]). Increasing the theoretical gestational age showed comparable results. Conclusions: Prolonged use of ADs during pregnancy appeared to be associated with an increased risk of developing PIH. When balancing the benefit and risks of using these drugs during pregnancy, this should be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|Background : Eclamptic {{convulsion}} is a live threatening condition {{associated with}} high maternal and perinatal mortality. It remains {{a major cause of}} maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Methods: This is a prospective, descriptive, cross-sectional hospital based study, concerned with the management of eclampsia in Khartoum teaching hospital, Khartoum north teaching hospital and Omdurman maternity hospital during the period from November 2002 to March 2003. The study was carried out to analyze the protocol for management of eclampsia in these hospitals. It includes fifty cases who presented with eclampsia, details of management were studied using questionnaire. Results: The incidence of eclampsia was 8. 8 / 1000 total births, and the maternal mortality was 18 %. The cause was cerebral heamorrhage in 10 % of cases. General life saving measures (O 2 therapy, airway, oral suction and input output chart) were taken by some but not all doctors. The anticonvulsant drug used was diazepam in (72 %), Mgso 4 in (14 %) of cases. The doses were not standardized. The frequency of recurrence of convulsions was 84 % and the mean time taken for control of convulsions was 18 hrs. The anti-hypertensive drug used was nifedipine in (42 %) and <b>dihydralazine</b> in (20 %) of cases. The doses were also different from patient to patient and the control of blood pressure was poor (40 % at 2 hrs – 54 % at 6 hrs – 76 % at 24 hrs of delivery). Rate of caesarean section was 72 % and mean time interval for delivery was 3. 5 hrs. General anesthesia was used in (81 %) of cases of abdominal delivery. It was given in all cases by medical assistant. Prolonged impairment of consciousness was noted. Glasgow coma < 8 was noticed in 74 % of cases at 24 hours - and in 48 % of case at 48 hours after delivery. It was significantly related to the use of diazepam. Conclusion: It is shown from the study that a definite protocol is lacking in these hospitals. The study recommended that a strict protocol for management of eclampsia to be established and the drugs and equipments needed to be made available, with continuous revision of the protocol and its out come...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{antihypertensive}} {{treatment in}} one–clip, two kidney hypertension in rats. In order {{to investigate the}} consequences of antihypertensive therapy on hormonal and renal parameters in one–clip, two kidney renovascular hypertension, we compared the effects of converting enzyme inhibition (CEI) with those of tripletherapy (clonidine, <b>dihydralazine</b> and furosemide) in this experimental model in rats. The treatment period was initiated four weeks after application of the clip and was continued for five weeks. In plasma, renin was increased and renin substrate was negatively correlated to plasma renin. Hypertension was associated with activation of the renin angiotensin system in both plasma and kidney. The degree of activation of the renin–angiotensin system in the clipped kidney and its suppression in the undipped kidney was evaluated by two methods, renal renin content and semi-quantification of juxtaglomerular hyperplasia by immunofluorescent renin. These two methods were correlated. During the treatment period, average systolic blood pressure was 144 ± 13 mmHg in the CEI treated group (HT 1) which was {{not significantly different from}} the value found in the sham–operated group (139 ± 4 mmHg; C 2). Blood pressure, however, was lowered only to 173 ± 18 mmHg in the group treated with tripletherapy (HT 2). In control hypertensive animals, the wt of the clipped kidney did not decrease whereas significant hypertrophy was present in the undipped kidney. Tripletherapy did not alter this relationship, whereas converting enzyme inhibition decreased kidney wt in the clipped kidney and increased further the hypertrophy of the contralateral undipped kidney. A histological examination revealed that hypertensive microangiopathy was a predominant feature in the undipped kidney of the untreated hypertensive group and of the group treated with tripletherapy, these lesions were completely absent in the CEI treated group. In the CEI treated group, however, ischemic lesions during this treatment were found to be decreased in the contralateral undipped kidney and increased in the clipped kidney by comparison with untreated hypertensive rats. These renal lesions observed in the clipped kidney were most likely related to the normalization of blood pressure or to a disturbance of intrarenal mechanisms normally mediated by the renin–angiotensin system during stenosis of a renal artery...|$|E
40|$|Consistent {{with its}} highest {{abundance}} in humans, cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 3 A {{is responsible for}} the metabolism of about 60 % of currently known drugs. However, this unusual low substrate specificity also makes CYP 3 A 4 susceptible to reversible or irreversible inhibition by a variety of drugs. Mechanism-based inhibition of CYP 3 A 4 is characterised by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) -, time- and concentration-dependent enzyme inactivation, occurring when some drugs are converted by CYP isoenzymes to reactive metabolites capable of irreversibly binding covalently to CYP 3 A 4. Approaches using in vitro, in silico and in vivo models can be used to study CYP 3 A 4 inactivation by drugs. Human liver microsomes are always used to estimate inactivation kinetic parameters including the concentration required for half-maximal inactivation (K(I)) and the maximal rate of inactivation at saturation (k(inact)). Clinically important mechanism-based CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors include antibacterials (e. g. clarithromycin, erythromycin and isoniazid), anticancer agents (e. g. tamoxifen and irinotecan), anti-HIV agents (e. g. ritonavir and delavirdine), antihypertensives (e. g. <b>dihydralazine,</b> verapamil and diltiazem), sex steroids and their receptor modulators (e. g. gestodene and raloxifene), and several herbal constituents (e. g. bergamottin and glabridin). Drugs inactivating CYP 3 A 4 often possess several common moieties such as a tertiary amine function, furan ring, and acetylene function. It appears that the chemical properties of a drug critical to CYP 3 A 4 inactivation include formation of reactive metabolites by CYP isoenzymes, preponderance of CYP inducers and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate, and occurrence of clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions with coadministered drugs. Compared with reversible inhibition of CYP 3 A 4, mechanism-based inhibition of CYP 3 A 4 more frequently cause pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions, as the inactivated CYP 3 A 4 has to be replaced by newly synthesised CYP 3 A 4 protein. The resultant drug interactions may lead to adverse drug effects, including some fatal events. For example, when aforementioned CYP 3 A 4 inhibitors are coadministered with terfenadine, cisapride or astemizole (all CYP 3 A 4 substrates), torsades de pointes (a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia associated with QT prolongation) may occur. However, predicting drug-drug interactions involving CYP 3 A 4 inactivation is difficult, since the clinical outcomes depend on a number of factors that are associated with drugs and patients. The apparent pharmacokinetic effect of a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP 3 A 4 would be a function of its K(I), k(inact) and partition ratio and the zero-order synthesis rate of new or replacement enzyme. The inactivators for CYP 3 A 4 can be inducers and P-gp substrates/inhibitors, confounding in vitro-in vivo extrapolation. The clinical significance of CYP 3 A inhibition for drug safety and efficacy warrants closer understanding of the mechanisms for each inhibitor. Furthermore, such inactivation may be exploited for therapeutic gain in certain circumstances. <br /...|$|E
40|$|A new {{prostaglandin}} - prostaglandin X (later renamed prostacyclin or prostaglandin I₂ (PGI₂)), {{was discovered}} by Moncada, Gryglewski, Bunting and Vane in 1976. This unstable substance was shown to be produced by vascular tissue {{and to be a}} vasodilator and the most potent endogenous inhibitor of platelet aggregation known. Because of its properties, it appeared that a lack of it {{may be related to the}} development and or maintenance of hypertension, a disorder featuring vasoconstriction and an increased tendency to arterial thrombosis. The present studies aimed to investigate this possibility using a rat model. A bioassay for prostacyclin was first perfected. This consisted of a modification of the method used by Moncada, Higgs and Vane (1977) : PGI₂ released by rat aortic strips, during incubation in tris buffer, was measured by assessing the ability of the incubate to inhibit adenosine diphosphate induced aggregation of human platelets, as compared to the inhibitory effect of standard prostacyclin sodium salt. The specificity of the assay for the detection of PGI₂ was tested. The abil ity of hypertensive rat aorta to release prostacycl in was investigated in two studies. The first compared aortas of Wistar rats of the New Zealand genetically hypertensive strain (GH) with those of matched normotensive Wistar controls. In the second study, hypertension was induced by wrappi ng the ri ght kidney with surgical silk and removing the contralateral kidney. Ten weeks later, aortic generation of prostacyclin by these animals was compared with that of matched sham controls which had received identical surgical manipulation but for the application of silk to the right kidney. Contrary to expectation, in both forms of hypertension, aortas of the rats with elevated pressure produced consistently more prostacyclin than those of matched controls. In order to discover more about the relationship between elevated pressure and elevated PGI₂ production, the effect of pressure reduction with hypotensive agents on the ability of GH rat aortas to produce prostacyclin, was investigated. After pressure had been controlled within normal range for one week (achieved by oral administration of furosemide, <b>dihydralazine</b> and reserpine for one month), aortic PGI₂ was reduced in comparison with matched GH controls. However, the reduction was not consistent and statistical significance was not reached. Because it was subsequently reported by other workers, that some of the hypotensive agents which had been employed may effect prostaglandin levels per se, no conclusions could be drawn from this study as to any possible direct relationships between pressure and aortic prostacyclin generating capacity. A further means of reducing elevated pressure (which had no inherent effect on prostaglandin levels) was thus sought. A mechanical method was eventually selected, application of a silver clip to the aortas of GH rats, just below the diaphragm, producing an immediate reduction in pressure distal to the constriction. Eighteen hours with later, PGI₂ production by these distal aortas those of matched sham GH controls and was was compared found to be consistently reduced. These results indicate that the ability to produce PGI₂ may be influenced by prior local pressure changes and that the increased capacity of hypertensive rat aortas to generate prostacyclin may be related to the increased mechanical transmural stress consequent on elevated pressure. Since haemostatic balance must be influenced not only by vascular PGI₂ generation but also by platelet sensitivity to PGI₂, the response of GH platelets to the anti-aggregatory effect of prostacyc 1 in was also investigated. As it had been shown by Sinzinger, Si 1 berbauer, Horsch and Gall (1981) that intra-arterial infusion of PGI₂ in humans decreased platelet sensitivity to the substance, the possibility existed that platelet sensitivity in hypertension might be reduced. This hypothesis was, however, invalidated as the sensitivity of GH platelets to the anti-aggregatory effect of PGI₂ was almost identical to that of normotensive controls. The shortcomings of the methodology and the possible importance of these findings in the hypertensive animal are discussed. The idea that elevated PGI₂ in hypertension may play a protective role both with respect to platelet aggregation and in attenuating further pressure rises is considered. It is finally suggested that it will be possible to draw more accurate conclusions as to the meaning of the increased PGI₂ generation in hypertension (both in relation to vascular tone and platelet function) only when details of production of, and sensitivity to, thromboxane A₂ are known. Thromboxane A₂ (TXA₂) is a vasoconstrictor and promotor of aggregation (Hamberg, Svensson and Samuelson, 1975) and it may be that, despite elevated vascular PGI₂ generation, the TXA₂/PGI₂ balance is still tipped in favour of vasoconstriction and platelet aggregation in hypertension...|$|E
