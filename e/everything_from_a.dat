25|$|The Fourth Amendment (1791) protects {{people against}} {{unreasonable}} searches and seizures of either self or property by government officials. A search can mean <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> frisking {{by a police}} officer or to a demand for a blood test to a search of an individual's home or car. A seizure occurs when the government takes control of an individual or something {{in his or her}} possession. Items that are seized often are used as evidence when the individual is charged with a crime. It also imposes certain limitations on police investigating a crime and prevents the use of illegally obtained evidence at trial.|$|E
25|$|Guinevere {{has been}} portrayed as <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> weak and {{opportunistic}} traitor to a fatally flawed but noble and virtuous gentlewoman. In Chrétien de Troyes's Yvain, the Knight of the Lion, she is praised for her intelligence, friendliness, and gentility, while in Marie de France's Lanval (and Thomas Chestre's Middle English version, Sir Launfal), {{she is a}} vindictive adulteress, disliked by the protagonist and all well-bred knights. Early chronicles tend to portray her inauspiciously or hardly at all, while later authors use her good and bad qualities to construct a deeper character who played a larger role. The works of Chrétien {{were some of the}} first to elaborate on the character Guinevere beyond simply the wife of Arthur. This was likely due to Chrétien's audience at the time, the court of Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, which was composed of courtly ladies who played highly social roles.|$|E
25|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 19 August 1852, Atlantic left Buffalo, heading for Detroit, {{under the command of}} Captain J. Byron Pettey. Every cabin was full, and over 250 passengers were on the deck, many Norwegian, Irish, or other European immigrants. Atlantic stopped at Erie, Pennsylvania to pick up even more Norwegian immigrants waiting for ships to take them west to Detroit. Around half of the immigrants waiting were taken aboard; roughly seventy had to be left behind due to lack of space. Atlantic was now dangerously overcrowded, with 500-600 people aboard; the ship's clerk did not keep an exact count. Baggage was piled on the deck, and passengers stayed wherever they could, including on the uppermost hurricane deck and the roof of Atlantic cabin. At 11 pm on 19 August Atlantic left Erie. The lake was calm; the sources are unclear about the level of visibility, with reports indicating <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> light mist to a heavy fog.|$|E

25|$|The {{legacy of}} Argentine Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara (June 14, 1928 – October 9, 1967) is {{constantly}} evolving {{in the collective}} imagination. As a ubiquitous symbol of counterculture worldwide, Guevara {{is one of the}} most recognizable and influential revolutionary figures of the twentieth century. However, during his life, and even more since his death, Che has elicited controversy and wildly divergent opinions as to who he was and what he represented. Mostly revered and occasionally reviled, he is passionately characterized along the entire continuum as <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> heroic defender of the poor, to a cold-hearted executioner. Admired, sanctified, romanticized and derided, his crystallized status as either a brilliant intellectual or a violent ideologue is usually dependent on where one falls along the left and right of the political spectrum. The debate around his legacy is further complicated by the fact that Guevara exists simultaneously as several different entities, both literal man and global emblem, leading to disputes between what people contend he did and what he now represents.|$|E

500|$|Midge {{was sold}} [...] "pregnant" [...] with Nikki, {{who was a}} tiny baby inside Midge's {{magnetic}} removable womb. This led to some controversy with some consumers saying that the doll was inappropriate for children, or that it promoted teen pregnancy. Another cause for this controversy was that Midge did not initially have a wedding ring, but this was later fixed. She also was packaged without Alan. Customers complaining about the doll led to Wal-Mart pulling the Happy Family line off their shelves. [...] A new version of this Midge was produced for Wal-Mart, this time not pregnant and with a cardboard cut-out display of Alan and Ryan standing next to her inside the box.

500|$|For Deadpool's scarred appearance, Miller {{wanted him}} to appear [...] "fucking horrible" [...] to justify his anger in the film, while makeup {{designer}} Bill Corso had some leeway because in the comics [...] "he’s <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> rotten corpse to {{a guy with a}} couple of lines on his face". Corso acknowledged the script's description of the character as disfigured but also {{wanted him to}} be [...] "still kind of charming and iconic". He wanted to avoid comparisons to Freddy Krueger, and looked to Sin City for inspiration. The final makeup required nine silicone prosthetics to cover Reynolds' head, which took several hours to apply. For the scene where the character is naked, it took six hours to apply the full-body makeup to Reynolds. Corso described the makeup {{for the rest of the}} film's characters as [...] "pretty simple.

Along with murder and other crimes, the team deals with a new romance and Hunt continues to work around strained relationships with her ex-husband and boss. The series still feels formulaic and doesn't quite fire on all cylinders for me, but season two was an improvement. The series leaves you wanting to see what will happen in season three.|$|E
2500|$|Food is such {{a central}} element in the Ice and Fire series that some critics have accused Martin of [...] "gratuitous feasting". By fans' count, the first four novels name more than 160 dishes, ranging from peasant meals to royal feasts {{featuring}} camel, crocodile, singing squid, seagulls, lacquered ducks and spiny grubs. Adam Bruski of The Huffington Post said the vivid descriptions of food do not just lend color and flavor to the fictional world but almost appear as a supporting character. Some dishes have a foreshadowing nature or are particularly appropriate to the mood and temperament of their diners. Much of the realism of Martin's cultures comes through their unique foods and tastes. The meals signal <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> character's disposition to plot developments, but also forebode the last profitable harvest before the coming winter. Inedible-sounding food was eaten at the Red Wedding in A Storm of Swords, preparing readers for the nauseating circumstances to come.|$|E

A second recurring race are the Moogles, whose Japanese name is a portmanteau of the words mogura (mole) and kōmori (bat); while frequently seen minding stores or assuming some other background role, they have also appeared as party allies or playable characters. Other recurring races include common monsters such as the cactus-like Cactuar, the Malboro, the Behemoth, the Tonberry, and the Iron Giant. A human character that has frequently appeared is [...] Making his debut in Final Fantasy II, he has appeared in multiple forms as <b>everything</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> player character to an antagonist.

Two other recurring human characters are Biggs and Wedge, a duo named after characters from the Star Wars franchise who are often used for comic relief. Making their debut in Final Fantasy VI as footsoldiers, they have since appeared in multiple Final Fantasy titles.
