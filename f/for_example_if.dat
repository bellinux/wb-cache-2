5|$|In most situations, revenue-maximizing {{prices are}} not profit-maximizing prices. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> {{variable}} costs per unit are nonzero (which they almost always are), then {{a more complex}} computation of a similar kind yields prices that generate optimal profits.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an allele, {{at any given time}} the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the population is simply its frequency in the population at that time. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> the frequency p for allele A is 75% and the frequency q for allele B is 25%, then given unlimited time the probability A will ultimately become fixed in the population is 75% and the probability that B will become fixed is 25%.|$|E
5|$|Either way, {{many of the}} {{countries}} involved in the crisis are on the euro, so devaluation, individual interest rates, and capital controls are not available. The only solution left to raise a country's level of saving is to reduce budget deficits and to change consumption and savings habits. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> a country's citizens saved more instead of consuming imports, this would reduce its trade deficit. It has therefore been suggested that countries with large trade deficits (e.g., Greece) consume less and improve their exporting industries.|$|E

30|$|RVQ needs {{different}} quantized bits {{for different}} SNR cases, {{so it will}} bring some design problems. <b>For</b> <b>examples,</b> <b>if</b> the feedback bits are fixed, it will cause waste for low SNR case and not enough for high SNR case. If feedback bits are flexible, new codebook will be retransmitted while SNR changed and it will decrease the effects of user selection between UEs with different SNR.|$|R
5|$|<b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if the economy is operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.|$|E
5|$|In Division I and Division III National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) hockey, {{the fighters}} {{are given a}} Game Disqualification, which is an {{ejection}} from the game and a suspension for as many games as the player has accrued Game Disqualifications {{during the course of}} a season. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> a player engages in a fight having already received a Game Disqualification earlier in the season, he is ejected from that game and suspended for his team's next two games. This automatic suspension has made fighting in college hockey relatively rare.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{describes}} how the FAA uses a formula ascribing specific monetary value to human lives, and how the agency allows numbers {{to decide whether the}} cost of extra safety is worth the additional expense. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> equipping an airline fleet with smoke detectors would cost $100 million, but would only save 10 lives each worth $1 million, then the expense is ruled out. Schiavo is similarly critical of the internal FAA politics and the FAA's administrators.|$|E
50|$|The {{attacker}} and defender typically {{compare the}} relative {{strengths of the}} units involved in the clash and reduce these numbers to a ratio, which corresponds to a column on the table (<b>for</b> <b>example</b> 2:1 <b>if</b> the attacker is twice {{as strong as the}} defender). Less often, the columns may be based on the difference between the combatants' strengths, rather than the ratio (<b>for</b> <b>example</b> '3', <b>if</b> an attacker with strength 5 attacks a defender with strength 2).|$|R

5|$|The Council is {{composed}} of twenty-eight national ministers (one per state). However the Council meets in various forms depending upon the topic. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> agriculture is being discussed, the Council will be composed of each national minister for agriculture. They represent their governments and are accountable to their national political systems. Votes are taken either by majority or unanimity with votes allocated according to population. In these various forms they share the legislative and budgetary power of the Parliament, and also lead the Common Foreign and Security Policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{boundary}} between gem-quality diamonds and industrial diamonds is poorly defined and partly depends on market conditions (<b>for</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> demand for polished diamonds is high, some lower-grade stones will be polished into low-quality or small gemstones {{rather than being}} sold for industrial use). Within the category of industrial diamonds, there is a sub-category comprising the lowest-quality, mostly opaque stones, which are known as bort.|$|E
5|$|The central {{concept of}} natural {{selection}} is the evolutionary fitness of an organism. Fitness is measured by an organism's ability to survive and reproduce, which determines {{the size of its}} genetic contribution to the next generation. However, fitness {{is not the same as}} the total number of offspring: instead fitness is indicated by the proportion of subsequent generations that carry an organism's genes. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> an organism could survive well and reproduce rapidly, but its offspring were all too small and weak to survive, this organism would make little genetic contribution to future generations and would thus have low fitness.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} {{chromosomes}} {{in the cell}} where trisomy occurs is represented as, <b>for</b> <b>example,</b> 2n+1 <b>if</b> one chromosome shows trisomy, 2n+1+1 if two show trisomy, etc.|$|R

5|$|The {{context-sensitive}} button mechanic {{allows one}} button {{to serve a}} variety of functions, such as talking, opening doors, and pushing, pulling, and throwing objects. The on-screen display shows what action, if any, the button will trigger, determined by the situation. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> Link is holding a rock, the context-sensitive button will cause Link to throw the rock if he is moving or targeting an object or enemy, or place the rock on the ground if he is standing still.|$|E
5|$|The general {{goal of a}} {{level is}} to gain control over every village on an island, {{accomplished}} through acts that persuade the villagers {{to believe in the}} player. Villagers can be swayed by everything from assistance with day-to-day tasks to being terrorised by fireballs and lightning storms. Artefacts (special objects that glow in their owner's colour) and missionary disciples can be used to impress villagers. Villagers become bored with repetitive attempts to impress them. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> boulders fly overhead too frequently, their effect is lost. This forces the player to use multiple methods to convert a village.|$|E
5|$|The size of {{the market}} determines the {{incentive}} to invest irrespective {{of the nature of}} the economy. This is because entrepreneurs invariably take their production decisions by taking into consideration the demand for the concerned product. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> an automobile manufacturer is trying to decide which countries to set up plants in, he will naturally only invest in those countries where the demand is high. He would prefer to invest in a developed country, where though the population is lesser than in underdeveloped countries, the people are prosperous and there is a definite demand.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} {{well-known}} drugs and toxins that inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Although {{any one of}} these toxins inhibits only one enzyme in the electron transport chain, inhibition of any step in this process will halt the rest of the process. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> oligomycin inhibits ATP synthase, protons cannot pass back into the mitochondrion. As a result, the proton pumps are unable to operate, as the gradient becomes too strong for them to overcome. NADH is then no longer oxidized and the citric acid cycle ceases to operate because the concentration of NAD+ falls below the concentration that these enzymes can use.|$|E
5|$|Alleles at a locus may be {{dominant}} or recessive; dominant alleles {{give rise}} to their corresponding phenotypes when paired with any other allele for the same trait, whereas recessive alleles {{give rise to}} their corresponding phenotype only when paired with another copy of the same allele. If you know the genotypes of the organisms, you can determine which alleles are dominant and which are recessive. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> the allele specifying tall stems in pea plants is dominant over the allele specifying short stems, then pea plants that inherit one tall allele from one parent and one short allele from the other parent will also have tall stems. Mendel's work demonstrated that alleles assort independently {{in the production of}} gametes, or germ cells, ensuring variation in the next generation. Although Mendelian inheritance remains a good model for many traits determined by single genes (including a number of well-known genetic disorders) it does not include the physical processes of DNA replication and cell division.|$|E
5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. <b>For</b> <b>example,</b> <b>if</b> A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as follows from regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E
