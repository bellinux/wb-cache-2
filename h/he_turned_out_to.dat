5|$|After {{finishing}} Yuka, Haruka, Saki, and Kurumi's routes, {{the player}} gets {{access to the}} Izumi Cure route, in which Makoto learns that Izumi and Okuhiko had deceived him into thinking that his premonitions were true. Makoto confronts Izumi, after which both he and Izumi fall off a cliff. They travel back in time, retaining their memories of the past six days. Makoto accepts that he has traveled through time, and Izumi reveals {{that she is the}} professor in charge of the seminar camp, and that {{the events of the past}} week were a science experiment; she attempted to test the phenomenon known as Curé Syndrome, where if multiple people believe in a delusion and the delusion is spread to others, the delusion becomes reality. Makoto was the test subject of the experiment, which was meant to involve him having the delusion that he could have premonitions; unexpectedly, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have real premonitions.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Baxter {{heard that}} the New South Wales University of Technology {{was looking for a}} {{professor}} of chemical engineering. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia on the ocean liner Orcades, arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They bought a house in Enfield, where Baxter would reside {{for the rest of his}} life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the Sydney Technical College campus in Ultimo. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most of the instruction was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous teaching experience, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a good, well-organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate students, whose research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England.|$|E

5|$|Khánh {{soon came}} to {{dominate}} the MRC. <b>He</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be far more politically astute and motivated than the previous junta, seeking out veteran Vietnamese politicians and technocrats {{to create a new}} government. A week after taking power, Khánh summoned Dr. Nguyen Ton Hoan, a Catholic {{who was one of the}} former leaders of the southern branch of the Đại Việt Quốc dân đảng (Nationalist Party of Greater Vietnam). Hoan had been exiled in Paris during the Diệm era, but remained active, publishing a magazine and keeping up to speed with developments in Vietnam. Hoan had generated little popular following during his campaign for power in the 1940s and 1950s and was unable to form a government as prime minister when he returned. Khánh thereupon decided to act as both Prime Minister and Chairman of the reorganized MRC, which he expanded to include 17 generals and 32 further officers for a total of 50 members. Hoan was appointed as the first Deputy Prime Minister in charge of rural pacification. He was given control of five ministries including the Interior, National Defense and Rural Affairs and two special commissions, which were primarily engaged in consolidating the strategic hamlets of Ngô Đình Nhu into the renamed New Rural Life Hamlets. The second Deputy Prime Minister was Harvard University-trained banker and economist Nguyễn Xuân Oánh, who was associated to the Đại Việt. Oanh was charged with managing the finance and economy of the country. Mậu was the Third Deputy Prime Minister, overseeing social and cultural affairs. Other Đại Việt politicians given cabinet posts included Phan Huy Quát as foreign minister and Ha Thuc Ky as interior minister. However, the second most powerful member of the new regime was Khiêm, who was defense minister, and Khánh firmly controlled the civilian government through the junta, which he rearranged to give greater weight to his fellow coup-plotters.|$|E

Zelena holds her head near the cauldron and threatens her and the witch says Merida has it. Arthur is shocked that Merida escaped and Zelena promises to make her pay. They then show up with Zelena demanding it while Merida asks why everyone wants it. Arthur says it has the power to make other men fight your battle and says he needs it but Merida says her father wouldn’t use magic to fight his battles. Mulan says they need the helm to protect their people but they don’t have it.

25|$|Monghyr {{was thus}} {{occupied}} by Mir Qasim Ali, the Nawab of Bengal (from 1760 to 1764). In 1763, Quasim shifted his capital from Murshidabad to Munger. His new appointee General Gurgin Khan from Isfahan patterned the Bengal Army {{on the lines}} of the British forces. At this fort, a factory for arsenal, for manufacturing of fire-arms was established. This tradition has continued to this day; several hundred families who have specialized in the manufacture of guns are continuing with this old tradition. He further added to the fortifications and also built palaces in the fort. Mir Quasim {{came to be known as}} a just ruler (he tried to eliminate corruption and injustice) but was also feared by his opponents as a fierce and ruthless warrior. He was also known for encouraging culture and had many scholars in his court. But all this ended soon as he had serious differences on trade and other administrative practices with the British. Mir Qasim later had to use the fort as a base for waging war against the British. But he was defeated in 1764. Later, <b>he</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a poor looser as he disgraced himself by committing serious atrocities on his own people in Munger fort and also in Patna, and also on the English army and other personnel who were captured in Patna. His criminal atrocities in Patna are known in the historical annals as the ‘Massacre of Patna’. Subsequently, the fort lost its glory. Lord Cornwallis, the Governor General, in British India, had built a country house here.|$|E

500|$|Due to prior {{experience}} in {{arms control and}} his personal relationship with Khrushchev, former Assistant Secretary of War John J.

Fisher, Carl Kaysen, John McNaughton, and William R. Tyler. In Britain, Macmillan initially wanted David Ormsby-Gore, who had just completed a term as foreign minister, to lead his delegation, but there were concerns that Ormsby-Gore {{would appear to be}} a US [...] "stooge" [...] (Kennedy described him as [...] "the brightest man he ever knew"). Instead, Macmillan chose Quintin Hogg. Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., a special advisor to Kennedy, believed that Hogg was [...] "ill prepared on the technicalities of the problem and was consumed by a desire to get a treaty at almost any cost." [...] Andrei Gromyko, the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, served as Moscow's emissary.|$|E
500|$|The video premiered on March 14, 2008 on AOL's The Boot. It commences with Swift and {{her best}} friend in a grey 2009 Ford Mustang GT 45th Anniversary Edition, parked behind a tree. Swift reminiscences, looking at a {{photograph}} of her and her ex-boyfriend together, and states, [...] "Would you look at how happy we were back then?

[...] Anderson is then seen ogling outside the window with binoculars, and spots Swift's ex-boyfriend and another woman arriving in a black late 90s ford f150 pick-up truck. She notes the other woman in driving the truck, and Swift states angrily he never allowed her to drive it. As Swift's ex-boyfriend and the woman start frolicking inside the truck, and the music begins and the music video transcends to a concrete room where the singer (clothed by a grey, one-shoulder mini-dress and black leather, thigh-length boots) is playing an electric guitar, alongside her backup band. During [...] "Picture to Burn"'s chorus, fire ignites behind them. Afterwards, the band is depicted entering a house furtively, using flashlights. Swift is sitting on a brown couch, sporting a black tank top, black leather pants, and beehive hair, as the band ransacks the house. They throw darts at photographs of him, envelop all of his furniture with toilet paper, mess his mirror with the word [...] "loser", lick his utensils and spit into his mouthwash. Suddenly, the ex-boyfriend and the woman are shown approaching the house, and, seeing this, Anderson informs them of it via handheld transceiver. He enters the house and discovers it was ransacked, and repeats the word [...] "Taylor". The video then transitions to Anderson and Swift inside the Ford Mustang, with Anderson also repeating [...] "Taylor". She then suggests leaving, and Swift says, [...] "You know what? I'm over it." [...] The video concludes with the photograph of Swift and her ex-boyfriend in flames, thrown in the sidewalk. Cut-scenes feature Swift and her band performing in the concrete room, Swift singing on the couch, or Swift dancing affront a shower of sparks. To date, the video has 96 million views on YouTube.|$|E
