5000|$|It {{should be}} mentioned, however, that a special {{condition}} exists: if a male three-conductor plug is partially inserted into a female two-conductor socket {{such that the}} female ring contact bridges the gap of the male plug tip and first ring, then an identical signal will be connected to both these conductors, thus simulating a [...] "Y" [...] connection. Note this is definitely NOT a reliable connection and is only useful in a test or emergency situation. Further note that analog low and line level audio circuits usually tolerate this well if the volume (current) is not excessive, though other cases may not {{be due to the}} typical surge current that occurs at the moment all three conductors engage. Common example of condition: a typical 3.5 mm <b>earphone</b> <b>socket</b> of a mono radio or micro amp has a stereo headphone plug partly inserted. Mono audio should be delivered to both speakers if the plug depth is carefully adjusted in the socket.|$|E
