40|$|We use density {{functional}} {{theory to}} determine the equilibrium shape of graphene flakes, through the calculation of the <b>edge</b> orientation dependence of the <b>edge</b> energy and <b>edge</b> stress of graphene nanoribbons. The <b>edge</b> energy is a nearly linear function of <b>edge</b> orientation angle; increasing from the armchair orientation to the zigzag orientation. Reconstruction of the zigzag <b>edge</b> lowers its energy to {{less than that of}} the armchair <b>edge.</b> The <b>edge</b> stress for all <b>edge</b> orientations is compressive, however, reconstruction of the zigzag <b>edge</b> reduces this <b>edge</b> stress to near zero.

However, zigzag <b>edge</b> reconstruction produces graphene flakes with a six-fold symmetry, but with rounded <b>edges.</b> This shape is dominated by near zigzag <b>edges.</b> The compressive <b>edge</b> stresses will lead to <b>edge</b> buckling (out-of-the-plane of the graphene sheet) for all <b>edge</b> orientations, in the absence of hydrogen.

40|$|Abstract:- In this paper, {{we use the}} Hessian tensor in {{differential}} geometry for <b>edge</b> and corner detection. Most <b>edge</b> operators, such as Canny operator, detect <b>edge</b> centers and use gradient magnitude to represent <b>edge</b> strength. In this paper, for each <b>edge,</b> we detect three crucial elements, <b>edge</b> center, <b>edge</b> contrast, and <b>edge</b> span. Once the <b>edge</b> contrast and the <b>edge</b> span have been identified, they can be adjusted for different purposes, like contrast enhancement and sharpness enhancement. In addition, the Hessian tensor {{can be used to}} find corners, which are useful for feature selection and <b>edge</b> linking. Furthermore, based on detected <b>edge</b> elements, we also developed a hybrid method for image segmentation.
