5|$|The {{manganese}} content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the Spartan steel exceptionally hard. Around {{the beginning of}} the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted. In 1816, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>documented</b> that iron alloyed with manganese was harder but not more brittle. In 1837, British academic James Couper noted an association between miners' heavy exposure to manganese with a form of Parkinson's disease. In 1912, United States patents were granted for protecting firearms against rust and corrosion with manganese phosphate electrochemical conversion coatings, and the process has seen widespread use ever since.|$|E
5|$|The {{street is}} named after The Vine, an 18th-century public house, which in turn may have been named after a {{vineyard}} that existed at this location in Roman times. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>documented</b> on ratebooks as Little Swallow Street in 1675. It was laid out around 1686 and originally ran further, along {{what is now the}} Man in the Moon Passage. John Rocque's Map of London, 1746 shows Vine Street extending from Piccadilly northeast to Warwick Street. In 1720, the main properties on the street were a brewery and a carpenter's yard.|$|E

From William, who died in 1223, Royton passed to his son Thomas, who was still alive in 1254. Thomas's daughter Margery, who married Alexander Luttrell of Somerset, sold the majority of Royton and its outlying land to John de Byron in around 1260.

25|$|Pohick Church {{was photographed}} by Frances Benjamin Johnston in 1930 {{as part of}} the Carnegie Survey of the Architecture of the South; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>documented</b> by the Historic American Buildings Survey in 1941. A {{historical}} marker was erected by the state of Virginia commemorating the history of the structure in 1934, and can still be seen today, located just outside the church property itself. Next to it is a sign placed by the Civil War Trails Program in 2014 and detailing the Civil War-era history of the church and grounds. Also at the site is a marker detailing the history of the old telegraph line, one of the first in the world, which ran nearby and which is today memorialized in the name of Telegraph Road. The church is the centerpiece of a historic overlay district established by Fairfax County in 1970; it was the first such district designated by the county. It was added to the Virginia Landmarks Register in 1968, and to the National Register of Historic Places the following year. Restoration and maintenance of the church property is currently overseen by the Historic Pohick Church Foundation, formally known as the Pohick Church Endowment Fund Inc., a nonprofit organization established in 1983.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Soros was {{contacted}} by a French financier named Georges Pébereau who {{asked him to}} participate in an effort to assemble a group of investors to purchase a large number of shares in Société Générale, a leading French bank that was part of a privatization program (something instituted by the new government under Jacques Chirac). Soros eventually decided against participating in the group effort opting to personally move forward with his strategy of accumulating shares in four French companies: Société Générale, as well as Suez, Paribas, and the Compagnie Générale d'Électricité. In 1989, the Commission des Opérations de Bourse (COB—the French stock exchange regulatory authority) conducted an investigation of whether Soros's transaction in Société Générale should be considered insider trading. Soros had received no information from the Société Générale and had no insider knowledge of the business, but he did possess knowledge that a group of investors was planning a takeover attempt. Initial investigations found Soros innocent and no charges were brought forward, however, the case was reopened a few years later and the French Supreme Court confirmed the conviction on June 14, 2006, but reduced the penalty to €940,000. Soros denied any wrongdoing, saying news of the takeover was public knowledge and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>documented</b> that his intent to acquire shares of the company predated his own awareness of the takeover. In December 2006 he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights on various grounds including that the 14-year delay in bringing the case to trial precluded a fair hearing. On the basis of Article 7 of the European Convention on Human Rights, stating that no person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offense at the time that it was committed, the court agreed to hear the appeal. In October 2011, the court rejected his appeal in a 4–3 decision, saying that Soros had been aware of the risk of breaking insider trading laws.|$|E

After the end of the war, Bartik went on to work with the ENIAC designers John Eckert and John Mauchly, and helped them develop the BINAC and UNIVAC I computers. BINAC was the first computer to use magnetic tape instead of punch cards to store data and the first computer to utilize the twin unit concept, and Bartik programmed a guidance system to run on it for Northrop Aircraft. She was responsible for designing the UNIVAC's logic circuits. Recalling her time working with Eckert and Mauchly on these projects, she described their close group of computer engineers as a [...] "technical Camelot." ...|$|E
500|$|The monastery {{was damaged}} {{as a result}} of the 2011 Van earthquake. According to Ara Sarafian, [...] "parts of the main church collapsed, while other parts were {{significantly}} weakened. Old cracks got bigger, new ones appeared." [...] Turkish engineers reportedly inspected it and announced that they would commence restoration work in the spring of 2012. Sarafian wrote that [...] "such promises have been made in the past and one needs to be a little skeptical. The current state of the church makes such work much harder than at any time in the past." [...] He noted in a 2012 article that the local and provincial governments supported the preservation and restoration of the monastery. In October 2012, the artist Raffi Bedrosyan, who contributed to the restoration of the St. Giragos Church in Diyarbakır, stated that he had hoped to restore Varagavank and added that [...] "Both Ankara and Van agreed to launch the restoration project, but social and natural obstacles delayed the process.".

500|$|San Lorenzo Colossal Head9 is {{also known}} as San Lorenzo Monument66. It {{measures}} [...] high by [...] wide by [...] deep. The head was exposed in 1982 by erosion of the gullies at San Lorenzo; it was found leaning slightly on its right hand side and facing upwards, half covered by the collapsed side of a gully and washed by a stream. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>documented</b> by archaeologists, it remained for some time in its place of discovery before being moved to the Museo de Antropología de Xalapa. The headdress is of a single piece without a distinct headband. The sides display features that are possibly intended to represent long hair trailing {{to the bottom of the}} monument. The earflares are rectangular plates with an additional trapezoid element at the front. The head is also depicted wearing a nose-ring. The face is smiling and has wrinkles under the eyes and at the edge of the mouth. It has sagging cheeks and wide eyes. The mouth is closed and the upper lip is badly damaged. The sculpture suffered some mutilation in antiquity, with nine pits hollowed into the face and headdress.|$|E

In an interview, Altaylı told the newspaper that the monastery belonged to his grandfather and he inherited it from his father. The monastery was confiscated during the Armenian Genocide. A group of Armenians in Turkey, led by the activist Nadya Uygun, started a petition asking him to [...] "Apply to the Armenian Patriarchate of Turkey and transfer the title deed of the church to the concerned [...] foundation." [...] Altayli told Agos that he is ready to give it to the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople, but no government authority has approached him to respond to his offer to give back the church to its owners, and that they displayed no interest in cooperating. Revolutionary Socialist Workers' Party (DSİP) activists demonstrated in early October 2012 before the Habertürk headquarters in Beyoğlu, Istanbul demanding the return of the monastery land to the Armenians. As of September 2014, there was no progress. In 2017 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>documented</b> that the Turkish government actively tried to tear the stones of what remains from the monastery to construct a mosque, houses and other developments in the area.|$|E
500|$|The nature writers Mark Cocker and Richard Mabey, {{reviewing}} people's love of birds, {{observe that}} people are touched by feelings for birds {{in a variety of}} ways, such as enjoying the lapwing's [...] "joyous display", or the [...] "beauty and mystery" [...] of the tawny owl's call on a cold winter's night. They argue that people feel the simple companionship of birds, are inspired by them to create art, let them mark the seasons and provide a sense of place, and use them [...] "as symbols of joy and love". A former statesman, Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, was able to express his feeling for birds in his 1927 book The Charm of Birds. Such feelings, in turn, have stimulated the intention to conserve birds and their habitats. Around the same time as Grey was writing, the first conservation organisations were coming into being, starting in Britain, triggered by the rapid disappearance of familiar species as they were captured for their feathers or for food. A substantial folklore rich in symbolism has accrued around birds; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>documented</b> early in the 20th century as something that was already fading from memory. For example, the house sparrow has been associated with [...] "sex and lechery" [...] since ancient Egypt, where libidinousness was written with the sparrow hieroglyph. In the same vein, in the classical era the sparrow was sacred to the goddess of love, Aphrodite or Venus; the sparrow features in an erotic poem by Catullus for the same reason. Chaucer describes the summoner in his Canterbury Tales as being as [...] "lecherous as a sparwe".|$|E
