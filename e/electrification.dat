5|$|The {{station was}} closed for two weeks in September 2017 to allow for upgrade work {{as part of the}} <b>electrification</b> and upgrade work for the Great Western route. Works {{included}} resignalling, installation of overhead <b>electrification</b> gantries, and the start of construction of a new fourth platform.|$|E
5|$|There are {{political}} signals to prioritize <b>electrification</b> the tracks from Trondheim to Steinkjer plus the Meråker Line. NSB {{will need to}} replace the rolling stock in the 2010s, and want to coordinate the new stock with <b>electrification.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{formation}} of the London Passenger Transport Board in 1933, work to electrify the line from Liverpool Street to Shenfield began in association with the LNER. Progress had been halted by the war but work resumed after the end of hostilities. The line between Liverpool Street and Stratford was electrified from 3 December 1946, and the full <b>electrification</b> of the Shenfield line at 1500V DC was completed by late 1949. At the same time <b>electrification</b> of London Underground services in Essex and northeast and east London led to the withdrawal of some services from Liverpool Street, being replaced with LU operations. <b>Electrification</b> continued with the line to Chingford electrified by November 1960.|$|E
5|$|Before its takeover, the DR {{had carried}} out some joint <b>electrification</b> {{experiments}} with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared the Inner Circle. A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of electric traction, the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the <b>electrification</b> of their networks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electrification</b> by 2019 was {{announced}} in the Department for Transport's High Level Output Specification of 2012.|$|E
5|$|<b>Electrification</b> {{was finally}} {{carried out in}} the 1980s, as {{detailed}} below.|$|E
5|$|MR withdraws service between St Mary's (Whitechapel Road) and New Cross, pending <b>electrification</b> of the ELR.|$|E
5|$|Network Rail's {{plans for}} <b>electrification</b> of the Great Western Main Line include {{provision}} for flood defences {{where the line}} is in proximity to the Holy Brook.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{catenary}} stanchions on platform 4 is notably better kept than others, {{and carries}} a small plaque detailing {{the visit of}} Queen Elizabeth II on 7 May 1974, {{after the completion of}} <b>electrification</b> of tracks north of the point where it stands. This was significant because it marked the completion of the total <b>electrification</b> of the West Coast Main Line.|$|E
5|$|Perks {{was also}} a large {{shareholder}} in Yerkes' next target, the Metropolitan District Railway, usually known as the District Railway or DR. By March 1901, the syndicate had acquired a controlling interest in the DR and made a proposal for its <b>electrification.</b> Yerkes established the Metropolitan District Electric Traction Company (MDETC) on 15 July 1901 with himself as managing director. The company raised £1million (£ today) {{to carry out the}} <b>electrification</b> works including the construction of the generating station and supplying the new electric rolling stock. In September 1901, Perks became the DR's chairman.|$|E
5|$|Proposals for <b>electrification</b> of the Meråker Line {{have been}} made since the 1940s. By then the Swedish side had been electrified. This was {{initially}} desired also by NSB {{in an effort to}} cut the high operating costs of steam trains. However, lines with higher traffic received priority. By 1971 the last steam trains were retired and issue of <b>electrification</b> for marginal lines were shelved. The issue was pressed by regional bodies from 1978 and 1992, and then again from the 2000s. This time the issue was successful and in 2013 the Parliament of Norway approved the <b>electrification</b> of the Meråker Line and the section from Trondheim to Steinkjer. The plan is to start the physical construction in 2017 and finish by 2022.|$|E
5|$|Railroad Gazette {{reported}} {{about the}} <b>electrification</b> of the Erie Railroad's Rochester Division. It also reported about the Thebes Bridge {{at the time}} the bridge was opened in Illinois.|$|E
5|$|The 1998 Rapid Rail Study {{assumed that}} {{ridership}} would increase {{in direct proportion}} to improving travel times. The study concluded that {{in order to meet the}} five goals presented in the 20-Year Strategic Plan of 1997, Caltrain should first rehabilitate and enhance the line, then electrify it. By itself, <b>electrification</b> was not projected to significantly improve service, and the high estimated cost of <b>electrification</b> and its lower priority meant <b>electrification</b> would be deferred. Some of the money to accomplish the rehabilitation and enhancement of existing track came from funds that had been intended for the downtown extension. Steve Schmidt, a councilman from Menlo Park, argued that <b>electrification</b> instead should be the top priority to make the rail line more palatable to neighbors, citing improvements in noise and pollution. Other advocates for <b>electrification</b> of Caltrain noted the $1.2billion BART extension to San Francisco International Airport may have revived the decades-old dream of BART around the Bay, which would render an electrified Caltrain redundant. The <b>electrification</b> of Caltrain was assigned a higher priority than a future expansion of the system, which included proposals to bring service to Union City across the Dumbarton Rail Bridge and increased service to Gilroy. Under the latest proposal to revive rail service over the Dumbarton Rail Corridor, diesel multiple units would first be used to establish Dumbarton Rail service as a rail shuttle between a new rail station in Newark and Caltrain's Redwood City station, later extending service from Newark to Union City, and finally followed by a commuter rail operation running from Union City to San Francisco and San Jose using EMUs.|$|E
5|$|The Great Western Main Line from London to Bristol is in {{the process}} of being electrified. However because of cost overruns and delays, on 8 November 2016 the {{government}} announced that several elements of the programme would be deferred including <b>electrification</b> south west of Thingley Junction near Chippenham and Bristol Parkway. This will leave Temple Meads un-electrified but the new Hitachi Super Express trains are bi-mode so can operate as diesels around Bristol and can use electricity where the <b>electrification</b> work is complete. The <b>electrification</b> plans do not extend west of Bristol so local services will continue to be provided using diesel trains, with Class 165/166s cascaded from Thames Valley services scheduled to replace the 150/153/158s on local services.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} list {{contains a}} chronology {{of when the}} various sections of mainline railway lines were electrified. The list excludes industrial and short branch lines, as well as systems installed at ports and yards. The list contains the date when the <b>electrification</b> was taken into regular use on each section. It also notes if a section was opened as an electric railway, and if the line was prepared as an electric line, but where this was not taken into use immediately. The list contains the line and section to be electrified, and its length. The length indicates {{the length of the}} mainline section at the time of <b>electrification.</b> Due to changes of routes and shortening of lines, the current length of sections may be shorter. The sixth column shows the <b>electrification</b> system, including voltage and frequency in case of AC and no frequency in case of DC.|$|E
5|$|The newest service between Helsinki and Vaasa {{started on}} 12 December 2011, with the {{completion}} of the <b>electrification</b> work on the Seinäjoki–Vaasa line.|$|E
5|$|The town of Atherton, {{which lies}} on the tracks, was an early and vocal {{opponent}} of <b>electrification.</b> Residents opposed <b>electrification</b> and the proposed high-speed rail route because the overhead electrical lines would require tree removal and the town could potentially be divided in two by permanently closing the two grade crossings at Fair Oaks Lane and Watkins Avenue.|$|E
5|$|With {{the coming}} upgrade to the Great Western Main Line, {{the main line}} from London to Bristol is due to be {{electrified}} by 2016. However, the <b>electrification</b> will not extend beyond the main lines, so Avonmouth {{will continue to be}} served by diesel trains. Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West; and the group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways support the <b>electrification</b> being extended to the Severn Beach Line.|$|E
5|$|After World War II the {{railways}} were run down, with Operation Phoenix unveiled in 1950, involving {{the expenditure of}} £80 million over 10 years. Works included <b>electrification</b> to Traralgon, new Harris suburban trains, the Walker railmotors, and approximately 3,000 new goods wagons.|$|E
5|$|By now the pre-war <b>electrification</b> scheme {{had been}} revived. In 1957 <b>electrification</b> between Rickmansworth and Amersham and Chesham began. Chalfont& Latimer's {{platforms}} were extended {{and a second}} platform was opened at Chesham on 3 July 1960 to prevent through operations to and from Baker Street from interfering with the Chesham–Chalfont& Latimer shuttle. An electric service using London Underground T Stock began operations between Chesham and Chalfont& Latimer on 16 August 1960, with former MR electric locomotives hauling the through trains to and from London. A steam locomotive was kept on standby in the new second platform at Chesham, {{in case of a}} failure of the electric trains. From June 1962 both the T Stock and the locomotive-hauled trains were replaced by the newly introduced London Underground A Stock.|$|E
5|$|During the 1960s the {{installation}} of overhead <b>electrification</b> commenced between London Euston and both Liverpool Lime Street and Manchester Piccadilly. Phase 1 comprised <b>electrification</b> between Crewe and Liverpool and Manchester. Phase 2 involved the extension southwards from Crewe to London. The massive proportions of the Coronation Class resulted in their prohibition from operating under those wires. Camden's allocation was now run down (the remaining locomotives being transferred to nearby Willesden (1A)), whilst Polmadie's was dispensed with entirely. The bulk of the class was situated at either Crewe North or Carlisle, the Kingmoor shed (12A, 68A from 1958) now being used in addition to Upperby.|$|E
5|$|Electric {{locomotives}} {{were first}} acquired with the <b>electrification</b> {{of the suburban}} railways, the E class suburban engines acquired in 1923 and 1928–29, followed by the L class from 1953 when the mainline to Traralgon was electrified for briquette traffic.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>electrification</b> of the ELR, MR restarts service between St Mary's (Whitechapel Road) and New Cross. MR starts {{service from}} Whitechapel to Shoreditch and Surrey Quays to New Cross Gate.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Robert Selbie was {{appointed}} Secretary of the Metropolitan Railway, {{working on the}} <b>electrification</b> of the London sections of the line; by 1905 the route was electrified as far as Harrow, although the sections north of Harrow, including the Chesham branch, continued to be worked by steam power. In 1908 he {{was appointed}} General Manager, a position he was to hold until 1930. Selbie realised that Watkin's schemes and the expensive <b>electrification</b> project had left the company with major financial liabilities, and that the MR's core business in central London would come under significant pressure {{as the use of}} automobiles increased and as the new Underground Electric Railways of London tube lines improved their services. Selbie set out to reshape the MR as a feeder route for goods and passengers into London.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Procter & Gamble {{opened a}} large plant near Arlington Yard, later called Port Ivory, {{resulting}} in additional traffic. The line's <b>electrification</b> project was completed on Christmas Day of 1925, cutting ten minutes off of travel time from Arlington to Saint George.|$|E
5|$|In July 1994, {{shortly before}} privatisation, the station closed for seven weeks for an £83 million project to replace signals, track and <b>electrification</b> works. It {{was the first}} {{significant}} closure of a London terminal station.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Howe & Company used an 0-4-0 {{saddle tank}} {{locomotive}} to transport building materials during the hospital's construction. The locomotive was purchased new in 1900, {{and sold in}} 1903 following {{the completion of the}} hospital and <b>electrification</b> of the line.|$|E
5|$|On April 30, {{legislators in}} the U.S. Congress {{released}} the proposed 2017 federal budget, which included partial {{funding for the}} <b>electrification</b> project, but restricts its distribution unless Secretary Chao signs off on the grant. The proposed budget includes $100million of the $647million grant, with the balance expected in future years. Secretary Chao claimed she could not sign the grant without the full grant being budgeted, which was disputed by Caltrain and both California Senators Dianne Feinstein and Kamala Harris. On May 22, the FTA announced its intent to sign the funding grant, restoring the final piece of funding for the <b>electrification</b> project. The official grant was finally signed on May 23.|$|E
5|$|The line is not {{currently}} electrified, {{and there is}} local support for <b>electrification</b> {{as an extension of}} the Great Western Main Line upgrade programme. A community centre and café was opened at the station in 2011.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} {{electrified}} from Hastings to Ore in 1935. This {{was done in}} order that trains could be serviced in a siding away from the centre of Hastings; this has since closed. <b>Electrification</b> through to Ashford was planned, but abandoned in 1939 when the war started.|$|E
5|$|The {{reception}} {{given by}} footplate crews {{was such that}} more of the class were constructed for {{other parts of the}} network, although the <b>electrification</b> of the Southern's Eastern Section meant that they were dispersed from their original stamping grounds.|$|E
5|$|The system's {{predecessors}} {{date back}} to the opening of the Trunk Line in 1854. By 1902, all the routes used by the present commuter rail had been taken into service. <b>Electrification</b> started in 1922, and Class 62 EMUs were introduced in 1931, followed by Class 65 units in 1936 and Class 67 in 1953. <b>Electrification</b> was completed in 1963. In 1980, the Drammen Line was connected {{to the rest of the}} system and all trains started operating to the new OsloS. The high-speed Gardermoen Line opened in 1998. In 2013, new Stadler FLIRT units were taken into traffic, and the Asker Line was completed just before. By 2018, the Follo Line is scheduled to open.|$|E
5|$|The {{western part}} of the Stadtbahn was {{electrified}} on 4 July 1993 up to Zoologischer Garten station. The eastern part of the line up to Ostbahnhof had been electrified since 1987. As soon as <b>electrification</b> reached the Zoo station, ICE trains began to use the station.|$|E
5|$|As Amtrak is in {{the process}} of {{replacing}} its fleet of EMD AEM-7 locomotives with Siemens ACS-64, PCJPB entered discussions to purchase several retired AEM-7s to test the <b>electrification</b> system and to serve as reserve locomotives in the event of EMU unavailability. Because of the delay in delivering ACS-64s, the target sale date for the AEM-7 was moved out to June 2016.|$|E
5|$|At present Eurostar is {{concentrating on}} {{developing}} its connections with other services, but direct services to other destinations would be possible. However, the routes that any potential services {{are likely to}} take would include infrastructure that Eurostar's rolling stock has not been built to use— German railways mostly have 15 kV AC <b>electrification,</b> while the Netherlands uses 1.5 kV DC (except on HSL Zuid and the Betuweroute).|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, {{there would be}} a {{continuing}} need for fast freight locomotives, capable of operating on both electrified and non-electrified routes, without impeding the intensive use of the system by passenger trains. Suburban <b>electrification</b> used electric multiple units, which had no equivalent freight design. Although Bulleid built two prototype electric locomotives in 1941, these were, as yet, unproven, and freight haulage would be undertaken by steam traction for the foreseeable future.|$|E
