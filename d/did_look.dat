The game also features 3D cutscenes, which the future visual novel writer Kotaro Uchikoshi created 3D models for. While an American publisher <b>did</b> <b>look</b> into acquiring the rights to publish {{the game in the}} United States, it ended up being a Japan-exclusive game.|$|E

500|$|A {{scene in}} the film portrays the violent {{destruction}} of the towering Na'vi Hometree, which collapses in flames after a missile attack, coating the landscape with ash and floating embers. Asked about the scene's resemblance to the September11 attacks on the World Trade Center, Cameron {{said he had been}} [...] "surprised at how much it <b>did</b> <b>look</b> like [...] ".|$|E
500|$|Nixon biographer Irwin Gellman, {{writing in}} 1999, nine years after Morris, {{disagreed}} with the latter's conclusions. [...] Gellman argued that the Committee was a [...] "grassroots" [...] group which was [...] "far from sophisticated" [...] {{in its efforts to}} find a candidate. [...] Parmet wrote that the campaign was not well financed, [...] "Nixon had to learn that money would be scarce until he became a winner... The Nixon campaign of 1946 <b>did</b> <b>look</b> like a shoestring affair." [...] Aitken points out that Nixon spent no money on radio advertising during the campaign.|$|E
500|$|Inside, the [...] Mir {{resembled a}} cramped labyrinth, crowded with hoses, cables and {{scientific}} instruments—as well as articles of everyday life, such as photos, children's drawings, {{books and a}} guitar. It commonly housed three crew members, but was capable of supporting {{as many as six}} for up to a month. The station was designed to remain in orbit for around five years; it remained in orbit for fifteen. As a result, NASA astronaut John Blaha reported that, with the exception of Priroda and Spektr, which were added late in the station's life, Mir <b>did</b> <b>look</b> used, which is to be expected given it had been lived in for ten to eleven years without being brought home and cleaned.|$|E

500|$|Redwood said in 2013 {{that the}} {{disappearance}} [...] "on one {{reading of the}} evidence", <b>did</b> <b>look</b> like a pre-planned abduction: [...] "That undoubtedly would have involved reconnaissance." [...] Several witnesses described men hanging around near apartment 5A {{in the days before}} the disappearance and on the day itself. In May 2013 Scotland Yard wanted to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared, including six British cleaners in a white van who were offering their services to British expats. In October that year Scotland Yard and the BBC's Crimewatch staged a reconstruction—broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany—during which they released e-fits of the men seen near 5A and of the Smith sighting. Days after Crimewatch aired, Portugal's attorney general reopened the Portuguese inquiry, citing new evidence.|$|E
500|$|The {{destruction}} of the Na'vi habitat Hometree reminded commentators of the September 11 attack on the World Trade Center, one calling it a [...] "tacky metaphor" [...] and others criticizing Cameron for his [...] "audacious willingness to question the sacred trauma of 9/11". Cameron {{said that he was}} [...] "surprised at how much it <b>did</b> <b>look</b> like September 11", but added that he did not think that it was necessarily a bad thing. A French critic wrote: [...] "How can one not see the analogy {{with the collapse of the}} towers of the World Trade Center? [...] Then, after that spectacular scene, all is justified [...] indigenous peoples (the allied forces)... to kill those who [...] just like terrorists." [...] Another writer noted that [...] "the U.S.' stand-ins are the perpetrators, and not the victims" [...] and described this reversal as [...] "the movie’s most seditious act".|$|E
2500|$|Our {{challenge}} {{today is}} to insist that time will not become the Nazis' friend, that time will not fade our sense of specificity, {{the uniqueness of the}} Holocaust, that time will not lead us to make the Holocaust into an abstraction.

For memory is our duty to the past, and memory is our duty to the future.|$|E

2500|$|The {{video for}} the song was {{directed}} by Peter Dougherty and filmed in New York during a bitterly cold Thanksgiving week in November 1987. The video opens with MacGowan sitting at a piano as if playing the song's opening refrain: however, as MacGowan could not play the instrument, the close-up shot of [...] "his" [...] hands actually features {{the hands of the}} band's pianist James Fearnley wearing MacGowan's rings on his fingers. Fearnley found the experience [...] "humiliating" [...] but conceded that it <b>did</b> <b>look</b> better in the video to show MacGowan seated at the piano.|$|E
2500|$|Scott Wilkinson of AVS was {{similarly}} {{impressed by the}} visual effects (though he did not enjoy the movie itself): [...] "Even sitting too far away, the movie itself looked gorgeous—sharp as a tack with beautiful colors. The smallest details, such as Jaden Smith's character in the far distance, somehow looked clearer than I would have expected under normal circumstances; I got the distinct impression that the image could have been blown up by quite a bit and no detail would have been lost. The CGI animals <b>did</b> <b>look</b> a bit artificial, but that didn't bother me very much at all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Passman {{went into}} a long and very {{detailed}} discussion about his new teeth. He explained how the dentist had manufactured them to look just like his original teeth [...] had duplicated the defects and had even copied the eroded tobacco stains and chips of those being replaced. As he talked, he would pull his lips back and show us how perfect the imperfect teeth were. And they <b>did</b> <b>look</b> natural, not even and pearly white as most false teeth are...

2500|$|Salk {{preferred}} not to have {{his career as a}} scientist affected by too much personal attention, as he had always tried to remain independent and private in his research and life, but this proved to be impossible. [...] "Young man, a great tragedy has befallen you—you've lost your anonymity", the television personality Ed Murrow said to Salk shortly after the onslaught of media attention. When Murrow asked him, [...] "Who owns this patent?", Salk replied, [...] "Well, the people I would say. There is no patent. Could you patent the sun?" [...] The vaccine is calculated to be worth $7 billion had it been patented. However, lawyers from the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis <b>did</b> <b>look</b> into the possibility of a patent, but ultimately determined that the vaccine was not a patentable invention because of prior art.|$|E
2500|$|Lind said of {{assuming}} the role, [...] "The audition for Bianca {{felt like an}} amusement park ride. It was such a thrill {{to go to an}} audition by plane rather than subway! I can only hope I do half of what [...] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it." [...] Regarding Bianca being the [...] "moral center of Pine Valley" [...] and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did feel pressure in the beginning. [...] "I <b>did</b> <b>look</b> at some of [...] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca." [...] Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me feels very strongly that [...] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone else’s interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting to support your family and be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, [...] "I can feel the pressure, but I am going to let it go." [...] The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.|$|E
