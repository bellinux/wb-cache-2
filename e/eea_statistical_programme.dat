40|$|BACKGROUND: Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an {{autoimmune}} blistering {{disease of}} the skin characterized by autoantibody attack on collagen XVII. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the genetic complexity of COL 17 A 1, the gene which encodes for the autoantigen collagen XVII. The data {{will be used to}} determine whether there is an association between polymorphisms and haplotypes of COL 17 A 1 and genetic susceptibility to development of BP. METHODS: The genetic complexity in COL 17 A 1 was deduced by screening and then sequencing the gene. Haplotypes were constructed from the resulting polymorphisms using the <b>statistical</b> <b>programme</b> PHASE. The linkage disequilibrium (D') between the polymorphisms was deduced from haplotypic data using the <b>statistical</b> <b>programme</b> GOLD. Association of the polymorphisms and haplotypes was tested for, in a cohort of BP patients and controls. RESULTS: Screening of COL 17 A 1 for genetic variation was carried out in 29 individuals of North European caucasoid origin, and it revealed 19 single-nucleotide polymorphisms in approximately 14. 7 kb of sequence. These variants resulted in 60 different haplotypes in 191 individuals, of which 13 occurred above 1 % in the population. D' between the variants was found to be extensive, have a low correlation with physical distance and to extend over 33. 8 kb. No association was found with any of the polymorphisms or haplotypes and development of BP, when tested for, in a cohort of patients and controls. CONCLUSION: This study provides an extensive description of the genetic variation in COL 17 A 1 and shows no association of the genetic variants with susceptibility to BP...|$|R

40|$|Background: Spinal {{injury is}} {{a major cause of}} morbidity, {{mortality}} and long bed occupancy in patients admitted in Mulago Hospital. Several studies have reported different incidence and presentations of spinal injury 1 - 4. At Mulago hospital, road traffic crushes (RTC) {{is one of the most}} common causes of these injuries 5. However the magnitude of the problem is unknown and this impacts on planning of services. The main objective was to determine the prevalence and presentation of spinal injury among patients with major trauma admitted at Mulago hospital, Kampala. Method: A Cross-sectional descriptive study was done on 669 patients with major trauma admitted in the Accident and Emergency ward of Mulago Hospital. Newly admitted patients were consecutively enrolled in the study. Data was collected using questionnaires capturing information from relevant history, physical examination and X-ray interpretation. This was done between November 2008 and January 2009. Data was entered into the Epi-data <b>statistical</b> <b>programme</b> and exported to SPSS <b>statistical</b> <b>programme</b> for analysis. Results: Of the 669 patients enrolled, 59 had spinal injury thus giving a prevalence of 8. 8 %. Most of the patients had Neurological involvement and Frankel A was the most common neurological sign. All patients had X-rays done and fracture was the most common radiological diagnosis and the majority of the respondents had unstable spine. Long bone fractures were the most common associated injury. Conclusions and recommendation: The prevalence of Spinal injury among the trauma patients is 8. 8 % with Frankel A score being the most common neurological injury, while fractures being the most common radiological diagnosis. There should be measures instituted by the policy makers to prevent spinal injury. The hospital should be fully equipped to manage spinal injury patients before they go back into the community...|$|R

However, the X12 programme only produces satisfactory data if five years' historical data are available.

This method was initially designed to provide analysts with a guide to the underlying trend in the survey data and should be recognized as a second-best approach to X12. However, past experience in other countries suggests that Markit’s method of {{seasonal adjustment}} goes beyond this initial purpose and in fact in many cases outperforms X12 as a guide to comparable official data.|$|R

The major objective {{of this paper is}} to investigate factors that determine the export performance of the country by using an econometric model for the period 1970 / 71 - 2010 / 11. This study tried to review the export performance; trends and share of different export items and examine the long run and short run determinants of export performance of Ethiopia. The long run and short run estimates are investigated using Johansson cointegration and Vector Error Correction approaches. The data is collected from NBE (2011), <b>EEA</b> <b>statistical</b> data base CD-ROM (2010), and WB and WDI (2011). The findings of the study revealed that in the long run export performance has found to be positively influenced by real effective exchange rate, openness, RGDP of home country, infrastructural development and private credit as a ratio of GDP (financial development). The RGDP of trading partner has found to be statistically insignificant. Hence, the long run elasticities of export performance with respect to real effective exchange rate, openness, RGDP of home country, infrastructural development and private credit as a ratio ofGDP (financial development) are 0. 7, 0. 54, 1. 7, 0. 3 and 0. 44 respectively. In the short run only last year openness has directly involved in enhancing export performance of current year. Maintaining high and sustainable economic growth, improvements in infrastructural facilities and credit access, and maintaining conducive and stable exchange rate policies as well as working to reduce trade restriction mechanism should due emphasis so as to improve Ethiopia's export performance.
