5|$|Marisa Chase appears only in Uncharted: Golden Abyss. She is the {{granddaughter of}} an {{archeologist}} Vincent Perez. She carries a golden amulet, {{which was very}} important to her grandfather. She lived her youth with her grand father because her parents were shot when she was very young. She, just like Nate, got her climbing, knowledge of ancient artifacts and treasure hunting skills at age of 15. She has a problem trusting people who she doesn't know. When she calls someone her partner, that means that she trusts them. Her biggest difference to Elena is that she never uses a gun, even when she is <b>getting</b> <b>shot</b> at. She survived an RPG shot from Roberto Guerro during the events of the game. She finally decides to use a gun {{near the end of the}} game. She is voiced by Christine Lakin.|$|E
5|$|Walter and Astrid {{find the}} source of the {{electromagnetic}} pulse, and begin investigating the house the pulse was built on. At the same time, Peter and Olivia go to a rural meeting place where the sheriff said they would find the truck's owner, only to be shot at by the sheriff and his deputy, who are hell bent on keeping the town's secret. Walter manages to turn off the pulse, and all of the townsfolk revert to their deformed appearance. The daughter of one of the army scientists saves Olivia and Peter from <b>getting</b> <b>shot,</b> and explains that her father stayed in Edina to perfect the pulse. After Walter pleads to Broyles to let the townspeople keep their secret, the Fringe team decides to not report the case so that the remaining residents can live a normal life.|$|E

5|$|Rosebeary, flying Cobra Blue Ghost 28, {{called a}} Mayday but {{was able to}} safely exit the area and landed his {{severely}} damaged helicopter. His aircraft was totaled. He and Gunner Warrant Officer Charles Gorski were {{picked up by a}} HH-53C helicopter (Jolly Green 67), without incident. Rosebeary warned other aircraft against crossing the river. When Morse in Sandy 07 learned that the quick-snatch had failed, he and his wingman Sandy 08 broke off engaging the North Vietnamese and returned to Da Nang. Both Sandys were found to be so damaged they would take several days to repair. At 9:00p.m., Nail 59, {{a new version of the}} OV-10A Bronco aircraft equipped with the Pave Nail LORAN radar piloted by Gary Ferentchak, took over FAC duties. The SAR efforts were suspended for the night and the U.S. and ARVN forces remained unaware of the true strength of the NVA offensive. Advised by the FAC to remain in place, Hambleton moved to a safer spot in the jungle and dug a hole to hide in until morning. During the night, Nail 59 and King 27, an HC-130 commanded by Maj. Dennis Constant, stayed. They suddenly found themselves painted by Fan Song radar and narrowly missed <b>getting</b> <b>shot</b> down as well. At 53 years old, Hambleton was not a prime candidate to survive the cold, wet weather conditions.|$|E

25|$|The show parodies {{many things}} about popular culture, {{primarily}} being a spoof of {{shows such as}} Jackass; whereas they perform stunts designed to injure and/or humiliate an individual, the Fist team do things that would obviously kill them. Such as jumping off cliffs, being hit by trucks, <b>getting</b> <b>shot</b> in the head, etc. These dangerous stunts and outlandish actions are usually achieved {{with the use of}} computer generated imagery. Indeed, one of the most innovative and noteworthy features of Double the Fist is its extensive and imaginative use of CGI, especially considering that the programme was produced for a very low budget, even by Australian standards ($250,000 for all 8 episodes).|$|E
25|$|On 15 February, funeral {{procession}} of Ali Abdulhadi Mushaima, who died {{the previous day}} took place. The march was authorized. It was organized that the body be taken from the Salmaniya medical complex and then carried to the cemetery in Al Daih for burial. According to eye witnesses, more than 2,000 were starting to gather by hospital gates {{in order to take}} part in the procession, when riot police used tear gas and shotguns to disperse the crowd. One man, Fadhel Al-Matrook, died in hospital after <b>getting</b> <b>shot</b> by shotgun pellets. Al-Matrook's brother, who was near him, told the local newspaper Al Wasat that his brother was shot from a very short distance, 2 to 5 meters away, which caused internal bleeding and punctured his lungs. According to witnesses, at least 25 were injured as a result of police rubber bullets, tear gas and shotgun.|$|E

25|$|Clarice is apprehended by Hartman and, upon disparaging both him and {{his dead}} daughter, is {{shot in the head}} as the others watch from a distance. Jackson and Bud {{continue}} on with Elizabeth in tow. As a Deputy passes, Elizabeth screams out, inadvertently leading to Bud <b>getting</b> <b>shot.</b> Bud's death sends Jackson into a rage, as he kills the Deputy and has Elizabeth drive them in the deputy's vehicle in attempt to reach safety. During their drive, the two are pursued by the deranged Hartman, who opens fire on the two with one of the bullets severing Jackson's face and causing the vehicle to careen {{off the side of the}} road. Later that night, Elizabeth awakes handcuffed in Hartman's car and answers a dispatch call, alerting Sorells to her location. Sorells visits Verna and reveals to her that Hartman has Jedidiah at the old barn where Betty was killed. Verna feeds Sorells to her pigs and then gathers the family to converge on Hartman's location. At the barn, Hartman takes Elizabeth and the injured Jackson hostage, revealing that Jackson is Jedidiah Sawyer. Verna arrives and Hartman is soon incapacitated by the other Sawyers.|$|E
25|$|There {{originally}} {{was a brief}} shot in the scene where Bambi's mother dies of her jumping over a log and <b>getting</b> <b>shot</b> by man. Larry Morey, however, felt the scene was too dramatic, {{and that it was}} emotional enough to justify having her death occurring off screen. Walt Disney was also eager to show man burned to death by his fire that he inadvertently started, but this was discarded when it was decided not to show man at all. There was also a scene involving two autumn leaves conversing like an old married couple before parting ways and falling to the ground, but Disney found that talking flora did not work {{in the context of the}} film, and instead a visual metaphor of two realistic leaves falling to the ground was used instead. Disney and his story team also developed the characters consisting of a squirrel and a chipmunk that were to be a comic duo reminiscent of Laurel and Hardy. However, after years of experimentation, Walt felt that the story should focus on the three principal characters: Bambi, Thumper and Flower. The squirrel and chipmunk make only brief appearances in the final film.|$|E
25|$|The {{third season}} {{focuses on the}} characters' first half of their senior year, and also has the return of basketball. It {{features}} the arrival of Rachel Gatina, who brings conflict to the romance between Brooke and Lucas when she sets out to date Lucas. Peyton deals {{with the return of}} her mom, and tries to get to know her when she finds out she is dying from cancer. Jake and Peyton's relationship draws to a close and Peyton's romantic feelings for Lucas resurface later in the season. Chris Keller returns and helps Nathan and Haley reunite, also causing damage between Brooke and Lucas. The later of the season sees Nathan and Haley plan their wedding. A major subplot consists of Dan's efforts to solve the murder attempt that was made against him during the previous season's cliffhanger. A major episode ("With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept") involves most of the main cast in a hostage situation at Tree Hill High and culminates in Peyton <b>getting</b> <b>shot</b> in the leg, Jimmy Edwards committing suicide and Dan murdering Keith. At {{the end of the season}} finale after Nathan and Haley renew their vows he, Rachel, and Cooper are fighting for their lives after a car accident.|$|E

500|$|The costumes were chiefly {{influenced}} by World War II, the American Civil War, the American Old West, and 1861 samurai Japan.

500|$|As a {{young adult}} back in Australia, Wills {{developed}} a peculiar stream of consciousness style of writing that sometimes defied syntax and grammar.
