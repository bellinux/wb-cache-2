60|$|Other vizcachas soon {{begin to}} appear, each one quietly taking up his station at his burrow's mouth, the females, known by their greatly {{inferior}} size and lighter grey colour, sitting upright on their haunches, {{as if to}} command a better view, and indicating by divers sounds and gestures that fear and curiosity struggles in them for mastery; for they are always wilder and sprightlier in their motions than the males. With {{eyes fixed on the}} intruder, at intervals they dodge the head, emitting at the same time an <b>internal</b> <b>note</b> with great vehemence; and suddenly, as the danger comes nearer, they plunge simultaneously, with a startled cry, into their burrows. But in some curiosity is the strongest emotion; for, in spite of their fellow's contagious example, and already half down the entrance, again they start up to scrutinize the stranger, and will then often permit him to walk within five or six paces of them.|$|E
60|$|In the melodists proper the displays, in a {{majority}} of cases, are exclusively vocal, the singer sitting still on his perch. In the Troupials, a family of starling-like birds numbering about one hundred and forty species, there are many that accompany singing with pretty or grotesque antics. The male screaming cow-bird of La Plata, when perched, emits a hollow-sounding <b>internal</b> <b>note</b> that swells at the end into a sharp metallic ring, almost bell-like: this is uttered with wings and tail spread and depressed, the whole plumage being puffed out as in a strutting turkey-cock, while the bird hops briskly {{up and down on}} its perch as if dancing. The bell-like note of the male is followed by an impetuous scream from the female, and the dance ends. Another species, the common Argentine cow-bird of La Plata, when courting puffs out his glossy rich violet plumage, and, with wings vibrating, emits a succession of deep internal notes, followed by a set song in clear, ringing tones; and then, suddenly taking wing, he flies straight away, close to the surface, fluttering like a moth, and at a distance of twenty to thirty yards turns and flies in a wide circle round the female, singing loudly all the time, hedging her in with melody as it were.|$|E

50|$|The {{amount of}} {{influence}} {{at this early}} stage, accredited to the CIA varies from source to source.

During the initial negotiations Menzies proposed to keep the US out of the organization, but Spaak objected a further developments not being in a tripartite (Belgium - Great-Britain - United States) or multilateral setting. In the final report of the parliamentary inquiry there is little mention of CIA involvement, but investigative journalist Walter de Bock points, based on Pentagon documents, at the CIA's significant early organizational role and de facto control until 1968.

50|$|A {{postscript}} by Carthusian librarians {{states that}} the book had been presented by one Brother Beroaldus to cardinal Maffeo Barberini, who would later become Pope Urban VIII (1623-44). A further covering note suggests that the images were by the French seer Nostradamus (1503-66), and {{had been sent to}} Rome by his son César de Nostredame as a gift. There is, however, absolutely no contemporary evidence that Nostradamus himself was either a painter or the author of the work, whose contents in fact date from several centuries before his time—nor, indeed, that he had ever heard of it, given that it did not finally appear in print until after his death. The postscript is in fact dated '1629', and the covering note (not in Nostradamus's hand) from which the Nostradamian title derives cannot, {{on the basis of its}} contents, date from earlier than 1689 - though an <b>internal</b> <b>note</b> does refer to a source dated 1343.|$|E
