500|$|Present {{throughout}} the songs background {{is the use}} of violins and a choir, as well as guitar, string instruments, congas and a cajon. [...] However it does make subtle use of synths and electronic sounds. Musically and lyrically, it is influenced by Contemporary Christian music, and has a gospel feel, while including standard pop and R. The song opens with Bieber singing, [...] "And I pray" [...] over a keyboard, while the song's chorus repeats one simple refrain, [...] "I close my eyes and I can see a better day/ <b>I</b> <b>close</b> my eyes and pray." [...] In the lyrics, Bieber [...] "recognizes the pain and suffering in the world" [...] and then offers [...] "a passive solution" [...] through lines such as [...] "Children are crying / soldiers are dying / Some people don't have a home," [...] before compromising, [...] "I know there's sunshine beyond that rain / good times beyond that pain." [...] Vocally, Bieber's vocals are sung in a lower key compared to previous singles.|$|E

2500|$|Sometimes, when I read spiritual treatises {{in which}} {{perfection}} is shown {{with a thousand}} obstacles, surrounded by a crowd of illusions, my poor little mind quickly tires. <b>I</b> <b>close</b> the learned book which is breaking my head and drying up my heart, and I take up Holy Scripture. Then all seems luminous to me; a single word uncovers for my soul infinite horizons; perfection seems simple; I {{see that it is}} enough to recognize one's nothingness and to abandon oneself, like a child, into God's arms. [...] Leaving to great souls, to great minds, the beautiful books I cannot understand, I rejoice to be little because only children, and those who are like them, will be admitted to the heavenly banquet.|$|E
2500|$|Around age eleven, Mary Albert {{moved to}} a one-room house on Perdido Street with Louis, her {{daughter}} Lucy, and her common-law husband, Tom Lee. They lived next door to Mary Albert's brother Ike and his two sons. After {{dropping out of the}} Fisk School in 1912, Armstrong joined a quartet of boys who sang in the streets for money. He also started to get into trouble. Cornet player Bunk Johnson said he taught Armstrong (then 11) to play by ear at Dago Tony's Tonk in New Orleans, although in his later years Armstrong gave the credit to Oliver. Armstrong hardly looked back at his youth as the worst of times but drew inspiration from it instead: [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>close</b> my eyes blowing that trumpet of mine—I look right in the heart of good old New Orleans... It has given me something to live for." ...|$|E
2500|$|German {{fighter pilot}} schools relied on fuel. They {{required}} [...] per month. With this achieved, they {{claimed to be}} able to train 1,200 fighter, 250 ground-attack, 40 bomber, 75 jet-bomber, 64 recce and 40 night fighter pilots a month. The schools demands were never met. Just [...] were delivered in July 1944, [...] in August and [...] in September. There were plenty of cadets joining, but the primary schools had to be shut down in favour of running the advanced flight schools. The influx of bomber pilots helped keep output high but it was not to last. By the autumn, the Luftwaffe was seeking anyone who already had basic experience in flying, so they could bypass the primary stages of flight school. One Luftwaffe pilot wrote that [...] "Each time <b>I</b> <b>close</b> the canopy before take-off, I feel that I am closing the lid of my own coffin." ...|$|E

2500|$|Chesney's second major-label album Me and You was {{released}} in 1996. Its lead-off single, [...] "Back In My Arms Again", peaked just outside the Top 40 on the country charts, but the title track (which Chesney recorded on his previous album) and the single [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>Close</b> My Eyes" [...] (which was previously recorded by Keith Palmer on his 1991 debut album and then by Larry Stewart on his 1993 debut album Down the Road) both peaked at No.2 on the Billboard country charts. Me and You was Chesney's first gold-certified album. A cover of Mac McAnally's 1990 single [...] "Back Where I Come From" [...] was also included on this album. Though Chesney's version was never released as a single, {{it has become a}} song regularly played during his concerts. In recognition of his successful year, Chesney was honored with the 1997 Academy of Country Music's New Male Vocalist of the Year award.|$|E
