40|$|We {{ask what}} {{fraction}} of the variation <b>in</b> <b>incomes</b> across countries can {{be accounted for by}} investment distortions. In our neoclassical growth model the relative price of investment to consumption is a good measure of the distortions. Using data on relative prices we estimate a stochastic process for distortions and compare the resulting variance of <b>incomes</b> <b>in</b> the model to that in the data. We find that the variation of <b>incomes</b> <b>in</b> the model is roughly 4 / 5 of the variability of <b>incomes</b> <b>in</b> the data. Our model does well in accounting for 6 key regularities on <b>income</b> and investment <b>in</b> the data.

40|$|Income {{aggregates}} {{and poverty}} and inequality measures tend to show important differences when calculated either with disposable <b>income</b> reported <b>in</b> SILC data, {{or with the}} same income concept calculated {{on the basis of}} the microsimulation model EUROMOD, which starts from gross <b>incomes</b> <b>in</b> SILC. This is one of the reasons why gross <b>income</b> data <b>in</b> SILC are often regarded with some suspicion. In this paper we try to shed light on this question by 1) comparing gross <b>incomes</b> <b>in</b> SILC with gross incomes reported on the fiscal form for the same individuals; 2) testing a re-calibration of gross incomes proposed by Immervoll and O’Donoghue (2001), to make them consistent with reported net incomes. We find that on average fiscally reported gross incomes exceed gross <b>incomes</b> <b>in</b> the survey. It is not clear however, whether the method of constructing updated gross incomes through an iterative method using the observed net incomes and withholding tax rules, is a genuine improvement upon the reported gross income distributionstatus: publishe...|$|R
