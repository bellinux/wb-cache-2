30|$|Since the 2008 {{snowstorm}} {{disaster in}} southern China, the Chinese government has increasingly emphasized {{the role of}} emergency management, that is, the initial response and coping during the emergency stage of a disaster. Emergency response plans {{have been developed for}} all levels of Chinese government. Once a state of emergency has been declared, according to those plans, the government shall mobilize all possible resources to reduce the direct damage caused by the disaster and the indirect impacts due to <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> <b>assets</b> and disrupted socioeconomic life. Emergency management in China is quite costly. After the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, the Chinese central government spent RMB 19.1 billion Yuan during the first month, while the five affected provincial governments spent a total of RMB 18.5 billion Yuan.|$|E
40|$|Flood damage {{assessments}} are {{often based on}} stage-damage curve (SDC) models that estimate economic damage {{as a function of}} flood characteristics (typically flood depths) and land use. SDCs are developed through a site-specific analysis, but are rarely adjusted to economic circumstances in areas to which they are applied. In Italy, assessments confide in SDC models developed elsewhere, even if empirical damage reports are collected after every major flood event. In this paper, we have tested, adapted and extended an up-to-date SDC model using flood records from Northern Italy. The model calibration is underpinned by empirical data from compensation records. Our analysis takes into account both <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> <b>asset</b> and losses due to foregone production, the latter being measured amidst the spatially distributed gross added value...|$|R
30|$|The survey {{instrument}} consisted of questionnaire items that followed a linear progression, guiding respondents to recount their {{experiences of the}} flood and subsequent actions undertaken as they proceeded from emergency sheltering to permanent housing. The survey included both open- and close-ended questions. This article focuses on seven questions from the survey that center on housing recovery. Questions 1 – 3 asked respondents to report the amount of <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> their property and their belongings from a fixed-choice scale ranging from no damage (0 % loss) <b>to</b> complete <b>damage</b> (100 % loss). The study separated damage estimates for both contents (appliances, clothing, food, etc.) and structural <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> the residence. This distinction is important because of the aid distribution and limitations systems for disaster recovery in the USA. FEMA does not provide direct assistance for disaster recovery, which would involve equity building resources. Hence, {{anything that could be}} considered a “substantial improvement” is disallowed under Federal government aid restriction. Data were only collected on <b>damages</b> <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> <b>assets,</b> and did not attempt to estimate losses in other areas, such as cost of goods, economic losses, or emotional and psychological damages incurred. The list of sources that provided aid was derived from interviews with key informants, who reported the various organizations that were locally active in the recovery process.|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{will examine}} international {{aspects of the}} Year 2000 (Y 2 K) issue, {{in terms of how}} various countries are managing the problem and how international organizations are involved in that process. The paper notes that while international cooperation is essential in dealing with part of the problem, it is at the national level that preventive measures are undertaken and emergency services provided. Most NATO and OECD states have recognized that by now it will not be possible to find and fix all problems in software and embedded chips. Their focus, therefore, is shifting to the planning of contingency measures, that is, what to do when disruptions occur so that the physical safety of persons is protected, <b>damage</b> <b>to</b> <b>physical</b> <b>assets</b> is minimized (e. g., extensive networks of energy supplies and telecommunications), and resources for the common good are protected (e. g., water supplies). Not only is this conference timely, but the experience of various sectors can be shared to enable cross-sector comparisons to be made, for example, there might be lessons from within air transportation that might be applicable to the energy industry. In addition, while most countries have tended to focus on their national situation, this conference brings together persons from more than 25 countries, thus enabling further comparisons to be made on how other countries are pursing contingency plans. It is within this cross-sector and multinational context that international action and national responsibilities of aspects of the Y 2 K issue will be discussed. This presentation is in four sections. The first examines what is at risk and categorizes the kinds of disruptions likely to occur. The second presents an approach from which to understand how different countries are trying to manage the Year 2000 issue. This approach is based on a three-step process adopted by the US and other OECD countries, the most dependent on computer and electronic processing systems and large information networks. The steps are: (1) awareness and perception of the problem; (2) technical preventive measures; and (3) contingency action and consequence management. The same steps are used to examine the Y 2 K efforts of non-OECD countries. This presentation does not advocate a right or wrong {{way to deal with the}} issue, but uses the approach as a framework in which to understand what factors might be significant with regard to managing Year 2000 disruptions, especially at the international level. The third part of the presentation will examine the efforts of some of the relevant international governmental organizations and their activities regarding the Year 2000 issue. These organizations include the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU). Understanding how these international organizations function illustrates not only their role but also their limits in dealing with Y 2 K issues. Member states of these organizations are ultimately responsible for dealing with the Y 2 K issues at the national level. This includes cooperation among national and regional or local governmental authorities and emergency services, which at the end of the day [...] and on the day and the day after [...] will be responsible for dealing with Y 2 K disruptions. The fourth section will explore other measures, both non-governmental and governmental, urging states to pay more attention and which might include new processes to manage disruptions. For example, some industries lobby their foreign ministries to urge other states to undertake Y 2 K remediation. New international collaboration regarding the safety of nuclear weapons and associated early warning systems is being established which in future may yield to positive developments in political relations. This type of example is applicable to other sectors and illustrates some of the positive outcomes or lessons learned from the Y 2 K issue. On an assumption that there are these positive aspects, the term ''Y 2 K issue'' rather than ''Y 2 K problem'' is often used in this presentation...|$|E

As a way of illustration, the recent development of renewable energy has seen the rise of effective asset managers involved in the management of solar systems (solar park, rooftops and windmills). These teams are actually more and more teaming-up with financial asset managers in order to offer turnkey solutions to investors. Infrastructure {{asset management}} became very important in most of the developed countries in the 21st century, since their infrastructure network was almost completed in the 20th century and they have to manage to operate and maintain them cost-effectively.Software asset management is one kind of infrastructure asset management.|$|R

China's economic reforms have stimulated urban physical development through the commodification and marketization of land-use rights and building construction.

Within a short space of time, Shanghai, a city in a transition economy, is facing a great property glut for the first time in its history. It is the two-tier incentive structure that has created the dynamics of Shanghai's urban physical development since 1980. The marketization of buildings makes property development a viable business. Capitalization on valued properties in the open domain motivates key actors in the development process to initiate redevelopment projects.
