40|$|A {{reduction}} in voluntary feed intake {{is a major}} factor in the lost productivity of grazing lambs infected by gastrointestinal parasites yet the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Potential pathways involved in parasite-induced feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> were investigated in lambs with minimal previous exposure to parasites and artificially infected by the small intestinal parasite Trichostrongylus colubriformis. Six in vivo experiments were conducted on lambs housed in individual pens or metabolism crates with similar feeding and experimental procedures. In Experiment 1 (Chapter 4) the effect of T. colubriformis infection on short term feed intake in lambs and of some pharmacological agents on feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> were investigated. Prior to and for the duration of infection, lambs were fed once per day and feed intake recorded at regular intervals over the day (8 h). Following the onset of feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> in the infected group (9 weeks after commencing dosing), all animals were treated with an analgesic (codeine phosphate per os), an anti-inflammatory agent (indomethacin per os), a CCK antagonist (L 364 - 718 by subcutaneous injection) or saline (control) in a replicated Latin square design (n = 8). Although the pattern of feed consumption was similar in infected and non-infected lambs, average daily intake was reduced 32 % and short term intake (recorded at 10 minute intervals for the first hour of feeding, 15 minute intervals for the second hour and hourly for the next 6 hours of feeding) reduced 40 % by infection. This identified the key component by which intake was depressed and enabled the use of a short term intake model and short duration of action compounds to identify the pathways involved in <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> in this sequence of experiments. None of the pharmacological treatments increased intake in the infected group. These results suggest a {{reduction in}} the rate of consumption due to reduced hunger signals, rather than change of meal eating patterns, is the major cause of feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression.</b> Specific conclusions about the pathways investigated using the pharmacological agents could not be obtained. Experiment 2 (Chapter 5) was designed to investigate the roles of pain and osmolality on feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression.</b> Digesta samples collected prior to and during parasite infection and before and after feeding had similar osmolalities (240 - 260 mosmol/l) which indicated that feeding or infection had no effect on osmolality of digesta. Following the onset of feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> in infected animals, all animals were treated in a Latin square design (n = 4) with no treatment, saline, local anaesthetic (xylocaine) or analgesic (codeine phosphate) solution 15 minutes before feeding, by slow injection into the duodenum. There was no effect of these treatments on food intake. In the second part of the experiment, hyperosmotic solutions (mannitol and NaCI) markedly depressed short term intake in non-infected animals, suggesting a role for osmoreceptors in intake regulation. However these effects were not blocked by local anaesthetic so the depressed intake may have resulted from generalised malaise rather than from specific osmoreceptor effects. In Experiment 3 (Chapter 6) the role of peripheral CCK on <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> was examined by a dose-response study utilising the CCK antagonist, loxiglumide. Intravenous injection of 5, 10 or 20 mg/kg LW of loxiglumide to infected lambs 10 - 15 minutes before feeding (n = 6) had no effect on feed intake at any of the dose levels. In experiment 4 (Chapter 7) loxiglumide was infused intravenously for 10 minutes (30 mg/kg/h) before feeding and for the first 2 h (10 mg/kg/h) after feed was offered to minimise any effect of the rate of clearance of loxiglumide on the lack of feed intake response. As well, the rate of marker disappearance from the abomasum was recorded in both infected and non-infected animals. Continuous infusion of loxiglumide did not attenuate parasite induced <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> nor did it have any effect on abomasal emptying. Abomasal volume was reduced by infection (66. 3 vs 162 ml) as was the fractional outflow rate (2. 2 vs 2. 8 ml/min) but these differences were accounted for by the lower level of feed intake in the infected animals. In Experiment 5 (Chapter 8) brotizolam, a benzodiazepine appetite stimulant, thought to act on the hypothalamus, was administered in a dose-response study to infected and non-infected animals (n = 4) immediately prior to feeding or following termination of the first meal (45 minutes after feeding) and the feed intake response recorded. Brotizolam elevated both the short term (0 - 0. 75 h), daily (22 h) intake and all time intervals in the first 5 h after feeding in infected and non-infected animals when administered after the first meal but when administered prior to feeding elevated intake only over the first 6 h of feeding. In both cases the magnitude of the response was greater in infected animals than in non-infected animals. Brotizolam appeared to increase the rate of eating without having a major impact on meal eating patterns when administered before feeding. Where administration was after the first meal, the effect was due to an "extra" meal being consumed. These findings showed that infected animals can respond to central stimulators of intake although the mechanism of the response is not known. Opioids were implicated in <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> as the rate of intake rather than meal patterns appeared to be the major parameter depressed under parasitism. This was examined in experiment 6 (Chapter 9) where animals (n = 6) were fasted for 26 h or not fasted, then treated with saline (control), brotizolam (intake stimulant) or naloxone (opioid antagonist) immediately prior to feeding. Fasting stimulated feed intake in the short term (100 % increase in 75 min) and over the day (12 % increase) in both infected and non-infected animals. Following fasting, infected animals ate a similar amount of feed to the non-infected, fasted animals and more than the non-infected, non-fasted animals. The signals resulting from a one day fast were sufficient in the short term to override parasite induced mechanisms causing feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression.</b> Naloxone suppressed the intake stimulatory effects of a 26 h fast in both infected and non-infected animals, which supports a role for endogenous opioids as hunger signals. Where animals were not fasted, naloxone reduced intake only in the non-infected animals which suggested endogenous opioid levels may be lower in infected animals than in non-infected animals. In the final experiment (Experiment 7, Chapter 10) the role of central hunger and satiety mechanism were investigated. Infected and non-infected animals (n = 6) were treated with naloxone or saline by intravenous injection, or saline and met-enkephalinamide (an opioid analogue) by intracerebral infusion, or naloxone and the opioid analogue simultaneously to investigate the role of central opioids in feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression.</b> To determine the role of CCK induced satiety signals on feed intake at a central level, loxiglumide and CCK were infused separately and in combination for 30 minutes prior to feeding and for the first 60 minutes of feed on offer, into a lateral cerebral ventricle of the brain of infected and control animals (n = 6). The opioid analogue tended to increase intake in infected animals but the effect was not significant probably because the dose used was too low to elicit a response in sheep. Naloxone depressed intake only in the infected animals, which conflicted with the results of Experiment 4. As a consequence these results were inconclusive because of the single low dose of opioid analogue used and the conflicting naloxone responses. CCK alone depressed intake by 39 - 52 % only in infected animals and this effect of the 90 minute infusion was evident over the 8 h short term recording period. Loxiglumide attenuated the feed intake depressive effects of CCK in the infected animals to the extent that intake was elevated above control levels. Loxiglumide alone was an intake stimulant in both infected and non-infected animals. Intake was increased over the entire 8 h but mostly in the second hour when intake was increased by 188 % in infected animals and by 16 % in the non-infected animals and resulted in almost continuous eating. These results showed loxiglumide will temporarily block the effect of parasite infection on feed intake in sheep when administered centrally and the fact that it blocked the effects of exogenous CCK on intake indicated that the effect is mediated via CCK receptors. In conclusion GIT parasite infection reduced both short term and daily feed intake apparently by a change in rate of intake rather than any alteration in meal patterns. It was further suggested that anyone of a number of potential peripheral pathways, including changes to osmolality, gut emptying, pain and inflammation of the gut, alone is not involved in anorexia in sofar as the compounds used could block these factors and the results support the idea that <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> is mediated via a central mechanism. Intake in infected animals responded to a much greater extent when fasting, i. c. v. loxiglumide or brotizolam were employed. Feed intake thus appears to be regulated through the same mechanisms in infected and non-infected animals. The results from compounds affecting the central mechanism suggest central CCK receptors are important in parasite induced anorexia, possibly by changing the onset of satiety or by interacting with endogenous opioids to reduce the rate of feed intake. Secondly reduced endogenous opioids may be causing the reduction in the rate of feed consumption alone or as a result of other interactions. It was concluded that intake in parasitised animals could be increased to that of control animals by employing procedures and compounds thought to act on the hypothalamus...|$|E

40|$|Four-ruminally fistulated, multiparous, {{pregnant}} Holstein cows {{were studied}} to characterize ruminal adaptations {{during the transition}} from gestation to lactation. Cows were fed typical far-off and close-up diets, a late lactation diet containing wet corn gluten feed (20 % DM), and an alfalfa hay, corn silage based early lactation diet. Ruminal measurements were obtained 72 (late lactation), 51 (far-off dry), 23 and 9 (close-up dry) days before expected parturition and 6, 20, and 34 days postpartum. Measurements included total fill, dry matter fill, fluid fill, and water-holding capacity of the rumen. Dry matter intake and milk production data were collected daily and body weight and body condition were determined weekly. Body weights and condition increased during the dry period, whereas intake {{as a percentage of}} body weight decreased.

40|$|Antioxidants and {{fatty acids}} are {{associated}} with depression and inflammation, and inflammation appears to predict depression risk; hence, the associations between these nutrients and depression may be mediated by inflammation. We hypothesized that inflammatory markers interleukin (IL) - 6 and C-reactive protein (CRP) mediate the associations between antioxidant and fatty acid <b>intakes,</b> and <b>depression.</b> Participants were from the Hunter Community Study, a longitudinal cohort of adults aged 55 - 85 years. Dietary intake was assessed using the Older Australian's Food Frequency Questionnaire. Fasting blood samples were drawn for analysis of nutrient and inflammatory biomarkers. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 20 -item Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression scale at baseline and at 5 -year follow-up. Linear mixed models were used to investigate longitudinal associations between dietary <b>intakes</b> and <b>depression,</b> and mediation analyses were carried out to determine if IL- 6 and/or CRP were the mediators. Analyses were conducted on men and women separately and adjusted for potential confounders. Fruit and monounsaturated fat intakes were negatively associated with depression, whereas total fat and saturated fat intakes were positively associated with depression in both sexes. Omega- 3 polyunsaturated fat was inversely associated with depression in men only. IL- 6 was a significant mediator of the association between fruits with low carotenoid content and depression in women. CRP significantly mediated the relationship between total fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat <b>intakes</b> and <b>depression</b> in women, and saturated fat <b>intake</b> and <b>depression</b> in men.

Therefore we aimed to prospectively evaluate {{the influence of alcohol}} <b>intake</b> on incident <b>depression</b> in a Mediterranean cohort. Methods We assessed 13, 619 university graduates (mean age: 38 years, 42 % men) participating in a Spanish prospective epidemiological cohort (the SUN Project), initially free of depression. They were recruited between 1999 – 2008 and biennially followed-up during 2001 – 2010. At baseline, a 136 -item validated food–frequency questionnaire was used to assess alcohol intake. Wine was the preferred beverage. Participants were classified as incident cases of depression if they reported a new clinical diagnosis of depression by a physician and/or initiated the use of antidepressant drugs. Cox regression and restricted cubic splines analyses were performed over 82, 926 person-years. Results Only among women, an U-shaped relationship between total alcohol <b>intake</b> and <b>depression</b> risk was found (P = 0. 01). Moderate alcohol intake (5 – 15 g/day) was associated with lower risk (Hazard Ratio: 0. 62; 95 % Confidence Interval: 0. 43 - 0. 89). No association was apparent for higher intakes of alcohol or for any specific type of alcoholic beverage. Conclusions Moderate alcohol intake might protect against depression among women.

40|$|Abstract: Lumbar spinal {{stenosis}} (LSS) is an increasingly prevalent condition that has major health and economic implications. While {{there are many}} options {{for the treatment of}} LSS, exercise is widely considered a first-line intervention as it is associated with reduced complications and cost as compared to more invasive options. Currently, it is not clear if exercise is an effective approach to managing pain and perceived disability in patients with symptomatic LSS. Therefore, the purpose of this systematic review is to evaluate the published literature that has investigated exercise as a primary intervention for LSS. A search was conducted in electronic databases including PubMed, PEDro, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and AMED using the key words lumbar {{spinal stenosis}}, exercise, physical therapy, rehabilitation, and conservative treatment. Inclusion criteria consisted of published randomized controlled trials written in English that included exercise as the primary treatment in {{at least one of the}} groups, and had reported measures of pain and disability clearly stated. The search identified 310 studies of which 5 met all the inclusion parameters. Exercise appears to be an efficacious intervention for pain, disability, analgesic <b>intake,</b> <b>depression,</b> anger, and mood disturbance among patients with LSS. Further research is needed to determine which type of exercise is the most effective in managing symptoms associated with lumbar spinal stenosis...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Six adult {{dairy cows}} {{clinically}} diagnosed as hemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS) were {{the subjects of}} this study. The involved intestinal lesions were fixed in formalin and examined macroscopically and histopathologically. Pathological examinations revealed large intramural hematomas with necrotic foci, resulting in luminal obstruction. The mucosal layer in the lesions was detached from the intestinal wall, {{and there were no}} hemorrhagic changes in the lumen. The intramural hematomas were sometimes covered with histologically intact mucosal layer. These pathological findings were not consistent with those of “intraluminal blood clots ” reported previously. Gram-positive and anti-Clostridium antibody-positive short bacilli were found in hemorrhagic necrotic areas. However, the exact relationship between Clostridium spp. observed in the lesions and HBS remains unclear, because this bacterium is a normal inhabitant in cattle.

METHODS: Data on self-reported missed doses of cART was collected every 6 months in Swiss HIV Cohort Study participants. We identified behavioral groups associated with specific cART adherence patterns using trajectory analyses. Repeated measures logistic regression identified predictors of changes in adherence between consecutive visits. RESULTS: Six thousand seven hundred nine individuals completed 49, 071 adherence questionnaires [median 8 (interquartile range: 5 - 10) ] during a median follow-up time of 4. 5 years (interquartile range: 2. 4 - 5. 1). Individuals were clustered into 4 adherence groups: good (51. 8 %), worsening (17. 4 %), improving (17. 6 %), and poor adherence (13. 2 %). Independent predictors of worsening adherence were younger age, basic education, loss of a roommate, starting intravenous drug use, increasing alcohol <b>intake,</b> <b>depression,</b> longer time with HIV, onset of lipodystrophy, and changing care provider. Independent predictors of improvements in adherence were regimen simplification, changing class of cART, less time on cART, and starting comedications.

40|$|Because of <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> {{prior to}} calving and slow intake ascent post-calving, the {{transition}} period is the major risk period for abomasal displacements. Feeding and management practices that prevent other calving-related disorders {{reduce the risk of}} abomasal displacements. Cows that have excess body condition at calving are at increased risk of ketosis and abomasal displacements. Both excessive and minimal feeding of concentrates pre-calving may increase the risk of abomasal displacements. Feed bunk management is an important risk factor for abomasal displacements. Inadequate bunk space, high competition at the feed bunk, restricted bunk access time, and restricted feed availability may limit intake. Poor environmental and social adaptation of transition cows may limit feed intake. Low feed intake may lower rumen fill, providing greater opportunity for migration of the abomasum. The importance of bunk management practices that limit feed intake in causing LDA is likely greatest during the early post-calving period, because of the coinciding events of {{the transition period}}. Feed delivery practices can alter the actual nutrient densities of the consumed ration relative to nutrient specifications of the formulated ration. Sorting of the TMR in the feed bunk can also cause this problem. Fiber densities of the consumed ration that are below minimum recommended allowances may result. Excess TMR mixing may grind coarse particles and cause a lack of fiber physical form. Transition programs and feed bunk management practices should be monitored closely when investigating LDA problem herds...|$|E
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the gender-specific prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors across socioeconomic position (SEP) categories may unravel mechanisms involved {{in the development of}} coronary heart disease. Using a sample of 1704 community dwellers of a Portuguese urban center aged 40 years or older, assessed in 1999 – 2003, we quantified the age-standardized prevalence of nine established cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholester-olemia, smoking, sedentariness, abdominal obesity, poor diet, excessive alcohol <b>intake</b> and <b>depression)</b> across SEP and gender categories. Data on individual education and occupation were collected by questionnaire and used to characterize SEP. The prevalence of seven out of nine well-established risk factors was higher in men. Among women, the prevalence of most of the studied risk factors was higher in lower SEP groups. The main exception was smoking, which increased with education and occupation levels.

40|$|The {{transition}} period occurring 2 wk prepartum through 2 to 4 wk postpartum {{is the major}} risk period in the etiology of left displaced abomasum. The prepartum depression of intake and the slow postpartum increase in intake are risk factors causing lower ruminal fill, reduced forage to concentrate ratio, and increased incidence of other postpartum disorders. Uncomplicated ketosis, retained placenta, metritis, and hypocalcemia at parturition are risk factors for left displaced abomasum. Excessive amounts of concentrate during the prepartum period {{increase the risk of}} left displaced abomasum, which may occur from the lower ruminal fill caused by greater prepartum <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> and reduced forage to concentrate ratio, decreased ruminal motility from lower ruminal fill and higher volatile fatty acid concentration, and decreased abomasal motility and emptying from higher concentrations of volatile fatty acids. Effects of volatile fatty acids on motility may be exacerbated by low ruminal absorption of volatile fatty acids during the {{transition period}}. Minimal intake of concentrate during the prepartum period may increase the risk of left displaced abomasum through failure to increase the absorptive capacity of the ruminal papillae and failure of the microbial population of the rumen to adapt prior to the intake of high energy postpartum diets. Increased risk of left displaced abomasum in cows that are hypocalcemic at parturition may be due to decreased ruminal and abomasal motility.

40|$|Dry matter intake (DMI) is an {{important}} topic of research in dairy cattle. It is often studied relative to feed efficiency and disease. However, there are gaps in the current knowledge of DMI that remain to be filled. The objectives {{of the current study}} aimed to fill these gaps by estimating genetic parameters for DMI during the pre-fresh transition period, as well as examining the impact of lameness on DMI and milk production. In the current study, DMI during the dry period was moderately heritable, and had a high genetic correlation with lactating intake. This finding indicates DMI may be under similar genetic regulation during the dry period and lactation. Also, a low genetic correlation was found between the magnitude of <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> before calving and other DMI traits, suggesting that the decline in DMI at parturition would be minimally affected by selection for DMI at other time points. It was confirmed that lameness has a negative effect on milk production and feed intake in lactating dairy cattle. Milk production decreased earlier than intake when comparing daily averages in the days before treatment, suggesting that decreased intake may not be the cause of decreased production surrounding a lameness event. Milk production also did not return to pre-treatment levels, indicating a lasting effect of lameness. When compared to the average of healthy cows, lame cows deviated in both intake and milk production for the days surrounding treatment for lameness. After treatment, milk production of multiparous cows gradually returned to pre-treatment levels, whereas primiparous cows recovered more quickly.

40|$|To {{investigate}} the longitudinal association between fatigue {{and physical activity}} in Parkinson's disease (PD) and determine whether this association is distorted by potential confounders. Data from baseline, 3, 6, and 12 week assessments in a single blind randomized clinical trial with cross-over design were used (N = 153). The Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) {{was used to assess}} fatigue and an activity monitor to measure amount of physical activity (defined as % dynamic activity during each monitoring session). Time-independent and time-dependent factors were investigated for their possible univariate association with dynamic activity. Random coefficient analysis was applied. Candidate confounders were successively added to the longitudinal association model to determine if the association between dynamic activity and fatigue was distorted. A proportional change beyond 15 % was considered to be significant. Fatigue was significantly associated with physical activity (= - 0. 099, SE = 0. 032, P = 0. 002). This association was not significantly distorted by type of intervention, age, gender, social support, disease duration, disease severity, motor impairment, cognition, anxiety, or medication <b>intake.</b> <b>Depression</b> caused proportional change of 22. 2 % in the regression coefficient of MFI. After controlling for depression, a significant association between MFI and dynamic activity remained (= - 0. 121, SE = 0. 036, P = 0. 000). The association found between fatigue and dynamic activity suggests that patients who experience higher levels of fatigue are less physically active. However, the total explained variance of dynamic activity by fatigue alone was small, suggesting that fatigue is only a minor factor in the complex of behavioral aspects that affect the amount of physical activity in patients with PD. © 2009 Movement Disorder Societ...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Systemic {{inflammation}} {{is associated}} with both the dietary intake of magnesium, and depression. Limited experimental and clinical data suggest an association between magnesium and depression. Thus, {{there are reasons to}} consider dietary magnesium as a variable of interest in depressive disorders. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the association between magnesium <b>intake</b> and <b>depression</b> and anxiety in a large sample of community-dwelling men and women. This sample consisted of 5708 individuals aged 46 – 49 or 70 – 74 years who participated in the Hordaland Health Study in Western Norway. Methods: Symptoms of depression and anxiety were self-reported using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and magnesium intake was assessed using a comprehensive food frequency questionnaire. Results: There was an inverse association between standardized energy-adjusted magnesium <b>intake</b> and standardized <b>depression</b> scores that was not confounded by age, gender, body habitus or blood pressure (β=− 0. 16, 95 % confidence interval (CI) =− 0. 22 to − 0. 11). The association was attenuated after adjustment for socioeconomic and lifestyle variables, but remained statistically significant (β=− 0. 11, 95 %CI=− 0. 16 to − 0. 05). Standardized magnesium intake was also related to case-level depression (odds ratio (OR) = 0. 70, 95 %CI= 0. 56 – 0. 88), although the association was attenuated when adjusted for socioeconomic and lifestyle factors (OR= 0. 86, 95 %CI= 0. 69 – 1. 08). The inverse relationship between magnesium intake and score and case-level anxiety was weaker and not statistically significant in the fully adjusted models. Conclusion: The hypothesis that magnesium intake is related to depression in the community is supported by the present findings. These findings may have public health and treatment implications. <br /...|$|R
30|$|In {{contrast}} to anxiety-like behavior, the mice {{did not show}} behavioral differences for two other tests that evaluate depression, namely the Porsolt forced-swim test and tail-suspension test. This {{was the case in}} healthy mice as well as in mice with depression induced by reserpine. This finding suggests that dietary oils had little effect on the development of a depressed mood in mice and, interestingly, is not in accordance with previous results in humans, where intake of n- 3 PUFA was shown to reduce symptoms of depression (Peet and Horrobin 2002). The self-reported symptom of depression in humans is much more complicated than what is measured by the two behavioral tests in mice; so, {{it is not surprising that}} these two results do not correspond. Furthermore, a recent report showed no association between the dietary intake of n- 3 PUFA or fish consumption and depression, major depressive episodes, or suicide (Hakkarainen et al. 2004). Therefore, the relation between fish oil or n- 3 PUFA <b>intake</b> and <b>depression</b> can best be described at present as inconclusive.|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{examined}} environmental and socio-cultural factors postulated to predict {{adherence to a}} standard weight management program in Mexican-American women. In addition, the study gathered preliminary data {{on the effectiveness of}} the program with the study sample. One-hundred overweight or obese Mexican-American women in the Albuquerque area completed a pre-treatment intake and were enrolled in the group-based treatment. Of the 100 women who enrolled, 82 attended at least one treatment session. In terms of the predictors of treatment adherence, income was found to positively predict attendance in multivariate analyses. In addition, neighborhood satisfaction positively predicted reported walking goals completed, and familism (attention {{to the needs of the}} family above those of the self) negatively predicted reported calorie goals completed in multivariate analyses. In addition, exploratory analyses revealed that <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> symptoms and body image varied by level of attendance, such that treatment completers reported lower baseline levels of body dissatisfaction and depression symptoms. In terms of treatment effectiveness, women who completed the program demonstrated significant pre- to post-treatment weight losses, reductions in waist-to-hip ratios, and reduced symptoms of depression, binge eating and body dissatisfaction. The results of the current study support the idea that economic, environmental, socio-cultural, and psychological factors predict adherence to a standard obesity treatment in Mexican-American women. In addition, there is preliminary evidence that such a program may be beneficial for weight loss. The results of the current study indicate that weight management programs should attempt to address the multi-level barriers to adherence that Mexican-American women may face.

40|$|Increased obesity rates, an {{evolving}} food supply and the overconsumption of energy dense foods {{has led to}} an increase in research exploring addictive eating behaviours. This study aimed to investigate food addiction in a sample of Australian adults using the revised Yale Food Addiction Survey (YFAS) 2. 0 tool and how it is associated with dietary intake, personality traits and mental health issues. Australian adults were invited to complete an online survey that collected information including: demographics, dietary <b>intake,</b> <b>depression,</b> anxiety, stress and personality dimensions including impulsivity, sensation seeking, hopelessness and anxiety sensitivity. A total of 1344 individuals were recruited with the samples comprising 75. 7 % female, mean age 39. 8 ± 13. 1 years (range 18 - 91 years) and body mass index BMI 27. 7 ± 9. 5. Food addiction was identified in 22. 2 % of participants using the YFAS 2. 0 tool, which classified the severity of food addiction as "mild" in 0. 7 % of cases, "moderate" in 2. 6 % and "severe" in 18. 9 % of cases. Predictors of severe food addiction were female gender (odds ratio (OR) 3. 65 95 % CI 1. 86 - 7. 11) and higher levels of soft drink OR 1. 36 (1. 07 - 1. 72), confectionary consumption and anxiety sensitivity 1. 16 (1. 07 - 1. 26). Overall people with "severe" (OR 13. 2, 5. 8 - 29. 8) or extremely severe depressive symptoms (OR 15. 6, range 7. 1 - 34. 3) had the highest odds of having severe food addiction. The only variable that reduced the odds of having severe food addiction was vegetable intake. The current study highlights that addictive food behaviours are associated with a complex pattern of poor dietary choices and a clustering with mental health issues, particularly depression...|$|E
40|$|Background Quality of life (QoL) is an {{important}} measure and outcome within chronic disease management and treatment, including substance use disorders (SUD). The aim {{of this paper was}} to investigate correlates of poorer QoL of individuals entering SUD treatment in Norway, in order to identify subgroups that may most benefit from different interventions. Methods Twenty-one treatment facilities invited all incoming patients to participate. Five hundred forty-nine patients who enrolled between December 2012 and April 2015 are analyzed. QoL, substance use, mental and physical comorbidities, and exercise behaviors were measured. Multinomial regression analysis was used to determine variables significantly associated with poorer QoL. Results The majority of both genders (75  %) reported “poor” or “very poor” QoL at <b>intake.</b> <b>Depression</b> showed a strong association with poor QoL (relative risk ratio [RRR] 3. 3, 95  % confidence interval [CI] 1. 0 – 10. 3) and very poor QoL (RRR 3. 8, 1. 2 – 11. 8) among women. Physical inactivity among men was associated with very poor QoL (RRR 2. 0, 1. 1 – 3. 7), as was reporting eating most meals alone (RRR 2. 6, 1. 4 – 4. 8). Evaluating one’s weight as too low was also associated with poor QoL (RRR 2. 0, 1. 0 - 3. 9) and very poor QoL (RRR 2. 0, 1. 1 – 3. 7) among men. Consuming methadone/buprenorphine was a protective factor for men reporting poor QoL (RRR 0. 5, 0. 3 – 0. 9) and very poor QoL (RRR 0. 4, 0. 2 – 0. 9), as well as for women reporting very poor QoL (RRR 0. 2, 0. 0 – 0. 6). Conclusions Factors associated with poorer QoL among other healthy and clinical populations, such as impaired social and physical well-being and psychological distress, were also seen associated in this sample. Treatment should be targeted towards patients with these particular vulnerabilities in addition to focusing on substance-related factors, and interventions proven to improve the QoL of other populations with these vulnerabilities should be explored in a SUD context...|$|E

Client progress may follow highly variable temporal courses, and this variation in treatment courses may have important clinical implications. By analyzing treatment progress using growth mixture modeling up to the 6 th session in a sample of 192 outpatients treated under routine clinic conditions, the authors identified 5 client groups based on similar progress on the short form versions of the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation-Outcome Measure. The shapes of early change typical for these client groups were characterized by (a) high initial impairment, (b) low initial impairment, (c) early improvement, (d) medium impairment with continuous treatment progress, or (e) medium impairment with discontinuous treatment progress. Moreover, the shapes of early change were associated with different treatment outcomes and durations, and several <b>intake</b> variables (<b>depression,</b> anxiety, and age) enabled prediction of the shape of early change and/or prediction of individual treatment progress within client groups with similar shapes of change...|$|R

40|$|A {{relative}} decrease {{intake of}} n- 3 to n- 6 fatty acids has {{been implicated in}} the pathogenesis of depression. However, the associations between different sources of dietary n- 3, n- 6, and their ratio, {{and the risk of}} depression have not been prospectively studied. We prospectively studied 54, 632 women who were 50 to 77 years of age and free from depressive symptoms at baseline. Information on diet was obtained from validated food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) completed four times before baseline (1984, 1986, 1990, 1994). Clinical depression was defined as reporting both physiciandiagnosed depression and regular antidepressant medication use. Relative risks (RR) of clinical depression, adjusted for age and other possible risk factors, were estimate using Cox-proportional hazard models. During 10 years of follow-up (1996 - 2006), 2, 823 incident cases of clinical depression were documented. Long-chain n- 3 intake from fish was not associated with depression risk (multivariate RR for 0. 3 g/day increment= 0. 99 [95 % CI: 0. 88, 1. 10]). Intake of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) was not associated with depression risk, except in multivariate model adjusted for n- 6 linoleic acid (LA). For each 0. 5 g/day increment of ALA, multivariate RR was 0. 82 (95 % CI, 0. 71 to 0. 94). Interaction between ALA and LA was found to be significant for depression risk (P= 0. 02). Within quintiles of LA, a 0. 5 g/day increment in ALA was inversely associated with depression in the first, second and third LA quintiles (RR= 0. 57 (95 % CI, 0. 37 to 0. 87); 0. 62 (95 % CI, 0. 41 to 0. 93); 0. 68 (95 % CI, 0. 47 to 0. 96) respectively) but not in the fourth and fifth quintiles. The results of this large longitudinal study do not support a protective effect of long-chain n- 3 from fish or fish <b>intake</b> on <b>depression</b> risk. However, this study provides support for the hypothesis that higher ALA and lower LA <b>intakes</b> might reduce <b>depression</b> risk, but this relation warrants further investigation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractDairy {{producer}} increase {{milk production}} by over feeding grain diets that {{are high in}} starch and low in fiber to increase intake of energy and met dietary requirements of the high yielding dairy cows. However, these diets {{increase the risk of}} subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA). Thus, maximizing milk production without incurring Sub-acute ruminal acidosis is a challenging most dairy producers. The main aims of this paper were to review available article on general aspects of Sub-acute ruminal acidosis and its consequence in dairy cattle by focusing on past and recent article and helping to update the current knowledge for early recognition and limit the associated negative impact in dairy industry. Sub-acute ruminal acidosis is a well-recognized and economically important digestive disorder found particularly in well-managed dairy cattle. It is a consequence of feeding high grain diets to dairy cows and characterized by daily episodes of low ruminal which generally occurs when ruminal pH stays in the range of 5. 2 and 6 for a prolonged period resulting in depresses fiber digestion and possibly milk production. There is no typical clinical sign of illness in SARA affected cows. However, SARA is said to be associated with inflammations of different organs and tissues in dairy cows. Rumenocentesis remains the most reliable means of diagnosing SARA. The cow at risk to develop SARA includes cows in the early lactation, Primiparous cows and Cows grazing or fed with rapidly fermentable low fiber grass. SARA has long-term health and economic consequences, which include feed <b>intake</b> <b>depression,</b> fluctuations in feed intake, reduced diet digestibility, reduced milk yield, reduced milk fat percent, gastrointestinal damage, liver abscesses, and lameness. Apart from compromises to dairy cow health and economics, SARA is of concern for animal welfare reasons, since lameness and laminitis impact significantly on cow comfort and general well-being. Thus, it represents a significant concern for dairy industry and the cattle should be regularly monitored to facilitate early recognition of the condition and limit the associated economic losses...|$|E
40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{research}} supports the claim that a variety of psychotherapies are efficacious in the treatment of mental disorders. However, the mechanisms through which these therapeutic modalities result in symptom alleviation are not yet clear. In this dissertation, three process-outcome investigations were conducted to elucidate the relationship between therapist adherence/competence, the therapeutic alliance, patient skills, and treatment outcome. ^ In the first study, I conducted a meta-analytic review of studies in which therapist adherence or competence was examined in relation to outcome. Surprisingly, neither the mean adherence-outcome (r =. 02) nor competence-outcome (r =. 07) effect size estimates were found to be significantly different from zero. Moderator analyses revealed that larger competence-outcome effect size estimates were associated with studies that either targeted depression or did not control for the influence of the therapeutic alliance. ^ In the second study, I examined the relations of two factor-analytically derived components of the Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) with depressive symptom change that occurred either prior to, or subsequent to, an early and late session of cognitive therapy (CT). Variation in symptom change subsequent to the early session was significantly related to the WAI factor that assesses therapist-patient agreement on the goals and tasks of therapy, but not to a factor assessing the affective bond between therapist and patient. In contrast, both factors, when assessed in a late session, were significantly predicted by prior symptom change. ^ In the third study, measures of therapist adherence and the therapeutic alliance were examined simultaneously in the context of CT for depression in predicting depressive symptom change and patient use of CT skills. Results indicated a differential pattern of prediction in the two samples examined. In one, CT techniques exhibited a stronger association with patient CT skills and symptom change relative to the alliance, whereas the reverse pattern emerged in the second sample. A baseline symptom severity X CT techniques interaction indicated that between-study differences in <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> severity might in part explain the process-outcome differences. These findings suggest that the nature of the therapy sample examined may influence process-outcome findings in psychotherapy research. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{study was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the immune response {{and the impact of}} Trichostrongylus colubriformis infections on the performance of growing Santa Ines lambs. Thirty male lambs, 3 – 4 months of age, were maintained in individual pens and restrictively randomised by weight into 3 treatment groups: (1) infected group, artificially infected with 2500 T. colubriformis larvae, three times a week, for 13 weeks, and fed ad libitum; (2) Pair-Fed Group, non-infected and fed with the same amount of food consumed by the infected animal of the same class on the previous day; and (3) control group, non-infected and fed ad libitum. Refused feed was weighed daily to assess the food intake of each lamb. Animals were weighed weekly and blood and fecal samples were collected. At the end of the trial, all lambs were euthanized to determine worm burden and collect intestinal tissues and mucus samples for histological and immunological analysis. The infected group presented eosinophilia, increased number of inflammatory cells in the mucosa, in addition to an increased production of specific immunoglobulins against T. colubriformis, which partially prevented the establishment of infective larvae. As a consequence of parasitism, the infected lambs presented reduced serum albumin concentrations and demonstrated severe small intestine lesions, such as villous atrophy and epithelial erosion, which impaired the digestion and absorption of nutrients, causing a significant loss in performance. The infected group presented a 37 % reduction in daily weight gain (107. 26 ± 10. 8 g/day), when compared with the control group (171. 07 ± 7. 15 g/day). The infected lambs also demonstrated the worst food conversion, i. e., each animal needed to consume on average 10. 05 ± 0. 52 kg of food to gain 1 kg live weight. The voluntary hay <b>intake</b> <b>depression</b> in infected animals was small, and statistical difference (P< 0. 01) was seen only on two occasions (ninth and 12 th weeks), in comparison with the control group. In conclusion, Santa Ines lambs infected with T. colubriformis demonstrated a reduction in performance, caused by the damages produced by the adult nematodes in intestinal mucosa, and also by the immunopathological changes associated with the infection...|$|E
