Other colours of tile are occasionally seen, such as cream (in the East Cliff area) and honey (commonly used by Henry Holland, including on his design for the original Marine Pavilion). The tiles gave bungaroosh buildings an expensive-looking façade and were easier to work with than bricks.|$|E
2500|$|Portland cement is {{the most}} common type of cement in general use around the world as a basic {{ingredient}} of concrete, mortar, stucco, and non-specialty grout.

2500|$|In Britain particularly, {{good quality}} {{building}} stone became ever more expensive {{during a period}} of rapid growth, and it became a common practice to construct prestige buildings from the new industrial bricks, and to finish them with a stucco to imitate stone. Hydraulic limes were favored for this, but the need for a fast set time encouraged the development of new cements. Most famous was Parker's [...] "Roman cement". This was developed by James Parker in the 1780s, and finally patented in 1796. It was, in fact, nothing like [...] material used by the Romans, but was a [...] "natural cement" [...] made by burning septaria – nodules that are found in certain clay deposits, and that contain both clay minerals and calcium carbonate. The burnt nodules were ground to a fine powder. This product, made into a mortar with sand, set in 5–15 minutes.

2500|$|The {{development}} of modern Portland cement (sometimes called ordinary or normal Portland cement) began in 1756, when John Smeaton experimented with combinations of different limestones and additives, including trass and pozzolanas, {{relating to the}} planned construction of a lighthouse, now known as Smeaton's Tower. In the late 18th century, Roman cement was developed and patented in 1796 by James Parker; Roman cement quickly became popular, but was largely replaced by Portland cement in the 1850s. [...] In 1811, James Frost produced a cement he called British cement. [...] James Frost {{is reported to have}} erected a manufactory for making of an artificial cement in 1826.

30|$|Conserv samples {{exhibited}} a much slower, yet steady gain in compressive strength up to 56  days (Table  2).
