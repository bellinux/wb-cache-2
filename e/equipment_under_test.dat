Every electrically device has the potential of causing unintentional interference to other electrical devices. All unwanted currents or voltages that may arise in a system generate electrical noise. All kinds of unexpected radio-frequency (RF) energy produce this kind of noise. The term Electromagnetic Interference [...] EMI [...] describes the situation that electrical noise destroys the functionality of systems. Therefore, emissions and immunity tests have to be performed according to the harmonized European norms like EN 55020 standard. In this thesis, immunity to radiated fields testing will introduce and the basic requirements of the suggested test site which is a TEM stripline will also be mentioned. Stripline is a transmission line construction which provides a uniform electromagnetic field between its parallel plates. Radiated immunity can be defined as the product's ability to withstand EM energy that arrives via free-space propagation for its functionality. Design of a new TEM stripline for EMC testing is given in order to construct an alternative test site, a new stripline bigger than the one given by the standard was built. Main attention has been focused on the design parameters (characteristic impedance, field uniformity etc.) and calibration of the designed stripline. Defined stripline in the standard has 80 cm height but it is not sufficient for big <b>equipments</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> (EUTs). Then an alternative stripline can be used if it fulfills the specifications required by the standard...|$|R

In particular we report on our experiences {{with the use of the}} refinement techniques offered by the Cogito methodology as part of the pilot project. The project focused on a software subsystem of a testing device that determines the operational status of a piece of equipment. The software determines appropriate scheduling of tests as well as controlling the communication between the testing device and the <b>equipment</b> unit <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> Development also addressed the issue of assuring that specific safety-criteria were met by the test unit, for example, if any unit failed any single test then that unit must be determined to be faulty. The use of formal development techniques in this project included: ffl the formulation of a top-level specification; ffl the validation of various safety criteria; and ffl construction of a detailed design using [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{a system for}} measuring radiation efficiency of a small antenna operating alone or {{in the presence of}} objects similar to those as in an actual service. The system applies the direct approach to determining the antenna efficiency by measuring the radiated field over the entire sphere surrounding the tested antenna. In order to overcome problems associated with the conventional measuring <b>equipment,</b> the antenna <b>under</b> <b>test</b> is equipped with a miniature built-in VCO signal generator and supported by a low reflectivity dielectric positioner. The positioner is of sufficient size and strength to hold a human head phantom to investigate changes in radiation characteristics when the antenna operates {{in the presence of a}} human operator...|$|R

This is {{because most of the}} RF tests that require an {{anechoic chamber}} to minimize reflections from the inner surfaces also require the properties of a screened room to attenuate unwanted signals penetrating inwards and causing interference to the <b>equipment</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> and prevent leakage from tests penetrating outside.|$|E

These tests are relatively simple to carry out compared to other test procedures described in the literature and do not require sophisticated <b>equipment.</b> The machine <b>under</b> <b>test</b> is supplied through a dc supply at different rotor positions. The shaft torque is measured through a torque sensor during the tests. The test current is varied {{to take care of}} the saturation effects. From the measured torque data and known rotor position, the required parameters can be obtained. Tests performed on two different internal permanent magnet machines confirm the validity and effectiveness of the proposed technique...|$|R
50|$|An army, {{being the}} main branch {{responsible}} for land combat, {{is perhaps the}} best known group that conducts live fire exercises. Most live fire exercises occur within the military base where the units conducting the exercise are located. In some cases, one installation will host units from another for a larger live fire exercise. <b>Equipment</b> <b>tested</b> <b>under</b> these circumstances range from small arms and assault rifle fire {{all the way up}} to missile systems and artillery fire. In the case of small arms, the tests are usually proficiency based and aimed at ensuring a soldier can fire their assigned weapons. In the case of the latter, missile systems may be test-fired at remotely controlled drones to simulate a situation in which enemy missiles or aircraft are launched at allied or friendly forces, while artillery units can take the opportunity to test new shells or to fire under adverse weather conditions for a chance to see how the artillery pieces will perform.|$|R

50|$|The <b>equipment</b> <b>under</b> <b>test</b> must be {{monitored}} {{so that if}} the equipment fails under test, the failure is detected. Monitoring is typically performed with thermocouple sensors, vibration accelerometers, multimeters and data loggers. Common causes of failures during HALT are from weak product design, poor workmanship, and poor manufacturing. Failures to individual components such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, printed circuit boards occur because of these issues.|$|E
50|$|Test and {{supporting}} equipment configurations {{to be used}} within anechoic chambers must expose as few metallic (conductive) surfaces as possible, as these risk causing unwanted reflections. Often this is achieved by using non-conductive plastic or wooden structures for supporting the <b>equipment</b> <b>under</b> <b>test.</b> Where metallic surfaces are unavoidable, they may be covered with pieces of RAM after setting up to minimize such reflection as far as possible.|$|E

Typically most of it is located in a separate screened room attached to the main test chamber, in order to shield it from both external interference and from the radiation within the chamber. Mains power and test signal cabling into the test chamber require high quality filtering.|$|E

5000|$|Spectrum {{analysis}} {{can be used}} at audio frequencies to analyse the harmonics of an audio signal. A typical application is to measure the distortion of a nominally sinewave signal; a very-low-distortion sinewave is used as the input to <b>equipment</b> <b>under</b> <b>test,</b> and a spectrum analyser can examine the output, which will have added distortion products, and determine the percentage distortion at each harmonic of the fundamental. Such analysers were at one time described as [...] "wave analysers". Analysis {{can be carried out}} by a general-purpose digital computer with a sound card selected for suitable performance and appropriate software. Instead of using a low-distortion sinewave, the input can be subtracted from the output, attenuated and phase-corrected, to give only the added distortion and noise, which can be analysed.|$|E
