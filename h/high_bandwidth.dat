5|$|USB2.0 devices use {{a special}} {{protocol}} during reset, called chirping, {{to negotiate the}} <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth</b> mode with the host/hub. A device that is USB2.0 High Speed capable first connects as a Full Speed device (D+ pulled high), but upon receiving a USB RESET (both D+ and D− driven LOW by host for 10 to 20ms) it pulls the D− line high, known as chirp K. This indicates to the host that the device is <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> If the host/hub is also HS capable, it chirps (returns alternating J and K states on D− and D+ lines) letting the device know that the hub operates at <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> The device has to receive at least three sets of KJ chirps before it changes to <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth</b> terminations and begins <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth</b> signaling. Because USB 3.0 uses wiring separate and additional to that used by USB2.0 and USB1.x, such bandwidth negotiation is not required.|$|E
5|$|Standard USB hub ports {{can provide}} from the typical 500mA/2.5W of current, only 100mA from non-hub ports. USB3.0 and USB On-The-Go supply 1.8A/9.0W (for {{dedicated}} battery charging, 1.5A/7.5W full bandwidth or 900mA/4.5W <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth),</b> while FireWire can in theory supply up to 60watts of power, although 10 to 20watts is more typical.|$|E
5|$|USB2.0 was {{released}} in April 2000, adding a higher maximum signaling rate of 480Mbit/s (High Speed or <b>High</b> <b>Bandwidth),</b> {{in addition to the}} USB1.x Full Speed signaling rate of 12Mbit/s. Due to bus access constraints, the effective throughput of the High Speed signaling rate is limited to 280Mbit/s or 35MB/s.|$|E

5|$|Because grid {{computing}} systems (described below) {{can easily}} handle embarrassingly parallel problems, modern clusters are typically {{designed to handle}} more difficult problems—problems that require nodes to share intermediate results with each other more often. This requires a <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth</b> and, more importantly, a low-latency interconnection network. Many historic and current supercomputers use customized high-performance network hardware specifically designed for cluster computing, such as the Cray Gemini network. As of 2014, most current supercomputers use some off-the-shelf standard network hardware, often Myrinet, InfiniBand, or Gigabit Ethernet.|$|E

25|$|Noise: Amplifiers {{generate}} random voltage at {{the output}} {{even when there}} is no signal applied. This can be due to thermal noise and flicker noise of the devices. For applications with high gain or <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth,</b> noise becomes a very important consideration.|$|E

25|$|The Xbox 360 has an {{extensive}} amount of bandwidth {{in comparison to}} its competition; however, this statistic includes the eDRAM logic to memory bandwidth, and not internal CPU bandwidths. The eDRAM internal logic to its internal memory bandwidth is 256GB/s. The <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth</b> is used primarily for z-buffering, alpha blending, and antialiasing; it saves time and space on the GPU die. Between the eDRAM die and the GPU, data is transferred at 32GB/s. The memory interface bus has a bandwidth of 22.40GB/s and the Southbridge a bandwidth of 500MB/s.|$|E
500|$|Though <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth</b> {{devices are}} {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "USB2.0" [...] and advertised as [...] "up to 480Mbit/s," [...] not all USB2.0 devices are <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth.</b> The USB-IF certifies devices and provides licenses to use special marketing logos for either [...] "basic bandwidth" [...] (low and full) or <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth</b> after passing a compliance test and paying a licensing fee. All devices are tested according to the latest specification, so recently compliant low bandwidth devices are also 2.0 devices.|$|E

2500|$|DDR3 modules can {{transfer}} data {{at a rate}} of 800–2133MT/s using both rising and falling edges of a 400–1066MHz I/O clock. This is twice DDR2's data transfer rates (400–1066MT/s using a 200–533MHz I/O clock) and four times the rate of DDR (200–400MT/s using a 100–200MHz I/O clock).

2500|$|In 2011, JEDEC {{published}} the Wide I/O 2 standard; it stacks multiple memory dies, {{but does that}} directly {{on top of the}} CPU and in the same package. This memory layout provides higher bandwidth and better power performance than DDR4 SDRAM, and allows a wide interface with short signal lengths. It primarily aims to replace various mobile DDRX SDRAM standards used in high-performance embedded and mobile devices, such as smartphones. [...] Hynix proposed similar <b>High</b> <b>Bandwidth</b> Memory (HBM), which was published as JEDEC JESD235. [...] Both Wide I/O 2 and HBM use a very wide parallel memory interface, up to 512 bits wide for Wide I/O 2 (compared to 64 bits for DDR4), running at a lower frequency than DDR4. Wide I/O 2 is targeted at high-performance compact devices such as smartphones, where it will be integrated into the processor or system on a chip (SoC) packages. HBM is targeted at graphics memory and general computing, while HMC targets high-end servers and enterprise applications.|$|E
2500|$|The {{spectrum}} {{property rights}} model is often critiqued for potentially leading to artificial scarcity and the hold-up problem. The hold-up problem {{refers to the}} difficulty in aggregation of the spectrum [...] resources (which would be required for <b>high</b> <b>bandwidth</b> applications), as the individual spectrum owners could ask for very high compensation in return of their contribution. Since spectrum is a scarce finite good, there is a perverse incentive to not use it at all. Participants and existing spectrum owners in the spectrum market can preemptively buy spectrum, then warehouse it to prevent existing or newcomer competitors from utilizing it. The existing spectrum owner's official plans for this warehoused spectrum would be save it for an unknown future use, and therefore not utilize it at all for the foreseeable future. [...] In a partial or incomplete [...] "spectrum as property" [...] regulatory regime, incumbent and grandfathered owners who obtained spectrum under the old cause and merit policy, can obtain windfalls in selling the spectrum they obtained for no cost under the earlier regulatory regime. When a regulatory regime changed to the property model, the original merit and cause guidelines for incumbent and grandfathered users are often removed, and no regulatory review mechanism exists to check if the merit guidelines are still being followed, and if not, revoke the spectrum license from the incumbent spectrum owner and reissue the spectrum to a new user under old merit guidelines or sell the spectrum inline with the new [...] "spectrum as property" [...] policy.|$|E
