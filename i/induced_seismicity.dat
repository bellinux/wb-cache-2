5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault and other faults when they were already close to rupture. Such lake-induced seismicity is known from reservoirs and referred to as <b>induced</b> <b>seismicity.</b> Alternatively, earthquakes could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E

30|$|The {{mechanism}} behind fracturing processes {{is influenced}} by the presence of hydraulic conduits because fluid invasion affects the rheological properties of upper crustal structures ranging from fissured rocks to large faults (Zhang et al. 2002). The intrusion of fluids into fault zones changes the effective normal stress to a point at which new circumstances could <b>induce</b> <b>seismicity</b> by altering the rheological, chemical, and frictional properties of the region (Hickman et al. 1995). This mutual effect between seismicity and fluid intrusion triggers ongoing and evolving deformation, shaping the internal geometry of a fault zone, where fluid presence is constituted by structures with relevant permeability. While highly depending on the petrological properties of its protolith (Evans 1990), the spatial variations of the fault core and damage zone can be classified based on four endmember fault zone architecture styles: localized barrier, localized conduit, distributed conduit, and combined conduitâ€“barrier. By fitting any physical example into this categorization based on the ratio of fault zone components, one can qualitatively describe the fluid flow behavior of the fault, which varies between these endmembers (Caine et al. 1996).|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} we analyze {{relative}} contributions to the cause and mechanism of injection-induced micro-earthquakes (MEQs) at The Geysers geothermal field, California.

An {{important aspect of the}} analysis is the concept of a rock mass that is critically stressed for shear failure. This means that shear stress in the region is near the rock-mass frictional strength, and therefore very small perturbations of the stress field can trigger an MEQ. Our analysis shows that the most important cause for injection-induced MEQs at The Geysers is cooling and associated thermal-elastic shrinkage of the rock around the injected fluid that changes the stress state {{in such a way that}} mechanical failure and <b>seismicity</b> can be <b>induced.</b> Specifically, the cooling shrinkage results in unloading and associated loss of shear strength in critically shear-stressed fractures, which are then reactivated.

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that climate-induced melting of large ice sheets {{has been able}} to trigger fault reactivation and earthquakes around the migrating ice limit. Even today, the stress due to glacial isostatic adjustment can continue to <b>induce</b> <b>seismicity</b> within the once glaciated region. Northern Central Europe lies outside the former ice margin and is regarded as a low-seismicity area. However, several historic earthquakes with intensities of up to VII occurred in this region during the past 1200 years. Here we show with numerical simulations that the seismicity can potentially be explained by the decay of the Scandinavian ice sheet after the Weichselian glaciation. Combination of historic earthquake epicenters with fault maps relates historic seismicity to major reverse faults of Late Cretaceous age. Mesozoic normal faults remained inactive in historic times. We suggest that many faults in northern Central Europe are active during postglacial times. This is a novelty that sheds new light on the distribution of postglacial faulting and seismicity. In addition, we present the first consistent model that can explain both the occurrence of deglaciation seismicity and the historic earthquakes in northern Central Europe. postprin...|$|R

Here, {{we focus}} on â€˜blindâ€™ 1000 -m-long normal faults (with shear displacement â‰¤ 10 [*]m), which can hardly be detected using conventional seismic surveys, but might potentially <b>induce</b> <b>seismicity</b> felt on surface. The influence of the dissymmetry in the internal structure of the fractured damage zone DZ is numerically investigated by using 2 -D plane-strain finite-element simulations of a 1500 -m-deep fluid injection into a porous reservoir. The problem is solved {{within the framework of}} fully saturated isothermal elasto-plastic porous media by both accounting for fault slip weakening and shear-induced degradation of fault core permeability. The numerical results show that the presence of a thick fractured hanging wall's DZ (with Young's modulus decreasing with the distance to the fault core due to the presence of fractures) strongly controls the magnitude M of the seismic event induced by the rupture. In the case modelled, M changed by more than 1. 0 unit when the DZ thickness is varied from 5 to 50 [*]m (M ranges from âˆ¼ 0. 1 to âˆ¼ 1. 5, i. e. from a â€˜lowâ€™ to a â€˜low-to-moderateâ€™ seismicity activity). However, further extending DZ up to 90 [*]m has little effect and the relationship reaches a quasi-horizontal plateau. This tendency is confirmed considering other initial conditions and injection scenarios.

40|$|Geothermal {{power is}} a growing energy source; however, efforts to {{increase}} production are tempered by concern over induced earthquakes. Although increased seismicity commonly accompanies geothermal production, induced earthquake rate cannot currently be forecast {{on the basis of}} fluid injection volumes or any other operational parameters. We show that at the Salton Sea Geothermal Field, the total volume of fluid extracted or injected tracks the long-term evolution of seismicity. After correcting for the aftershock rate, the net fluid volume (extracted-injected) provides the best correlation with seismicity in recent years. We model the background earthquake rate with a linear combination of injection and net production rates that allows us to track the secular development of the field as the number of earthquakes per fluid volume injected decreases over time. The exploitation of geothermal resources israpidly expanding as society increases itsreliance on renewable energy sources. Production of geothermal power induces seis-micity as water is pumped both into and out of a reservoir (1, 2). Fluid injection, a major com-ponent of most geothermal operations, has been shown to <b>induce</b> <b>seismicity</b> in a variety of set-tings, and the earthquakes are often attributed to a decrease in the effective stress on faults due to increased pore pressure (3 â€“ 7).

Seismic consequences of geother-mal production are of particular concern for facilities neighboring large tectonic systems.

5000|$|From a model {{developed}} by geologists {{working in the}} UK, the drilling pipe penetrated the overpressured limestone, causing entrainment of mud by water. Whilst pulling the drill string out of the well, there were ongoing losses of drilling mud, {{as demonstrated by the}} daily drilling reports stating [...] "overpull increasing", [...] "only 50% returns" [...] and [...] "unable to keep hole full". The loss of drilling mud and associated drop in downhole mud weight eventually resulted in a drilling kick, with over 365 barrels of fluid erupting at the Banjar Panji-1 wellhead. Blowout preventers were closed to help kill the kick, which resulted in a spike in downhole pressure within the wellbore. The drilling-induced triggering model proposes that the increase in pressure within the wellbore was sufficiently high to induce a large hydraulic fracture in the formation. The extra pressure caused the hydraulic fractures to propagate 1-2 km to the surface and emerged 200 m away from the well. The lack of protective casing in the bottom 1742m of the borehole is considered a key reason why the drilling kick could not be controlled and why pressures during the kick were high enough to initiate hydraulic fracturing. Alternatively, it has also been suggested that the increased fluid pressure in the borehole, due to the kick, may have triggered reactivation of a nearby fault system, rather than hydraulic fracturing (in a similar manner to how fluid injection can <b>induce</b> <b>seismicity).</b> Though steel casing is used to protect the well bore in oil or gas exploration, this can only be applied in stages after each new section of the hole is drilled; see drilling for oil.|$|R
30|$|As formula (2) indicates, {{the level}} of {{seismicity}} before shut-in is independent on diffusivity, but would change with a lower threshold C_CPT required for the pressure before <b>seismicity</b> can be <b>induced.</b> The <b>seismicity</b> after shut-in, however, depends on both the injection rate and the diffusivity. In addition, C_CPThas a significant influence. Langenbruch and Shapiro (2010) have studied the post-shut-in seismicity in the CPT context in detail and hypothesized an Omori-type decay of the seismicity {{after the end of}} fluid injection. A higher diffusivity causes a more rapid decay of seismicity. The diffusion front propagates faster for high diffusivity and thus reaches the lower threshold earlier in time. A higher threshold leads to an earlier stop and thus shortens the duration of seismicity after shut-in.|$|R

40|$|The Cenozoic-Quaternary Main Ethiopian Rift (MER) is {{characterized}} by extended magmatic activity. Although magmatism has been recognized as {{a key element in}} the process of continental breakup, the interaction between melts and intruded lithosphere is still poorly understood. We have performed a 2 D thermo-rheological modeling study of continental crust incorporating rheological variations due to melt intrusion-related thermal perturbation. The model is calibrated based on the characteristics of lithologies occurring in the MER and its extensional history, and includes the effect of metamorphism and anatexis on crustal strength and rheological features. During Miocene early rift phases strain in the MER was mainly accommodated through rift border faults, whereas Pliocene-to-recent extension history {{is characterized}} by magma assisted rifting with most strain accommodated across magmatic segments in the rift axis. Consequently, very little strain is distributed in the old Pan-African to Paleogene crust during Pliocene to Holocene times. The magmatic activity along the rift axis created â‰ˆÂ  20 Â km thick magmatic segments, with growth rate estimated to range from â‰ˆÂ  3. 5 Â mmÂ yrâˆ’Â  1 to â‰ˆÂ  6 Â mmÂ yrâˆ’Â  1. Our model suggests that the strain transfer from Miocene rift border faults to magmatic segments was favored by a moderate increase in crustal strength, due to prograde metamorphism subsequent to the melt-induced thermal perturbation. Under such conditions, crustal stretching may not constitute an effective extension mechanism, thus strain may be preferentially accommodated by melt injection along hot, partially molten magmatic segments. Anatexis has been detected in our simulations, with melt fractions sufficient to break-up the crust solid framework and migrate. This determines local variations of rheological behavior and may <b>induce</b> <b>seismicity.</b> However, resulting melt percentages are not sufficient to induce widespread, crust-derived volcanic activity. Subsequently, volcanism in the MER is mainly due to mantle-derived melts, subjected to a various degree of fractionation, with minimal contribution from crust-derived magmas...|$|R
