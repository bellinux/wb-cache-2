25|$|Memory is {{the ability}} to preserve, retain, and {{subsequently}} recall, <b>knowledge,</b> <b>information</b> or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in philosophy, {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of cognitive psychology. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called cognitive neuroscience, a marriage between cognitive psychology and neuroscience.|$|E
25|$|Information science, in {{studying}} the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information has origins in the common stock of human <b>knowledge.</b> <b>Information</b> analysis {{has been carried out}} by scholars at least as early as the time of the Abyssinian Empire with the emergence of cultural depositories, what is today known as libraries and archives. Institutionally, information science emerged in the 19th century along with many other social science disciplines. As a science, however, it finds its institutional roots in the history of science, beginning with publication of the first issues of Philosophical Transactions, generally considered the first scientific journal, in 1665 by the Royal Society (London).|$|E

In this paper the authors operationally define the concept of media <b>information</b> <b>knowledge</b> and its relationship to the concepts of general education, general culture <b>knowledge</b> and general <b>information</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Furthermore, this paper analyses methodological problems of media <b>information</b> <b>knowledge,</b> i. e. construction and validation of testing instruments for media <b>information</b> <b>knowledge.</b> Based on the sample of 388 candidates for the graduate study of journalism, the following items have been analysed: the level of media <b>information</b> <b>knowledge</b> according to various knowledge areas; the metric characteristics and the relationship of the media <b>information</b> <b>knowledge</b> test with several correlates: gender, average grade during the study, test of professional journalists’ knowledge, vocabulary and foreign expressions knowledge, and orthography and grammar knowledge. Higher results in the media <b>information</b> <b>knowledge</b> test are related to better results in the professional journalists’ knowledge test, as well as with some aspects of general education, i. e. vocabulary and foreign expressions knowledge. It has also been found that male respondents have accomplished higher results in media <b>information</b> <b>knowledge.</b> A low correlation has been found with the average undergraduate study grade, while there is no relation of media <b>information</b> <b>knowledge</b> to orthography and grammar knowledge...|$|R

In the behind-the-scenes book Doctor Who: The Inside Story Davies explains that he [...] "always wanted to do a show with someone who was a rubbish companion" [...] and dubs Adam [...] "the companion that couldn't". In an episode of Doctor Who Confidential he characterised Adam as [...] "a little bit ambitious and [...] "a little bit too clever for his own good." [...] Langley added that the character ends up [...] "on {{the wrong side of the}} tracks" [...] because he likes [...] "meddling with things" [...] and that [...] "him thinking he's a genius gets him into bother". Explaining Adam's downfall, Davies states that he [...] "doesn't realize he's out for his own good until he's put in a situation of temptation, where <b>knowledge,</b> <b>information</b> and power are put in front of him." [...] Davies felt that Adam's story provided [...] "a chance to see someone starting on that path" [...] before the Doctor cuts his ambitions short.|$|E

The SEC's new whistleblower program also allows whistleblower to submit anonymous complaints if represented by an attorney. This represents a major benefit over other whistleblower reward programs that do not allow anonymous submissions, such as the IRS whistleblower program.

It can be the beginning, not only of individual <b>knowledge,</b> <b>information</b> and awareness, but also a holistic strategy for development and change. Education is very much connected to women's ability to form social relationships on the basis of equality with others and to achieve the important social good of self-respect. It is important, as well, to mobility (through access to jobs and the political process) and to health and life (through the connection to bodily integrity). Education can allow women to participate in politics so they can ensure that their voices and concerns are heard and addressed in the public policy. It is also crucial for women's access to the legal system. Although it must be considered that religion and traditions of the Pakistani affect women's education. Some women may choose to keep the traditional roles because that is what they have always known and are used to. It would be a great opportunity if women were able to make their choice on their own, though. They should at least have the knowledge of both sides to be educated or to stay with the traditional ways.|$|E

This article presents challenges of a large Finnish multinational company relating to their current <b>knowledge</b> and <b>information</b> management practices and systems. The focus is on New Product Introduction (NPI) process. The study is based on interviews and facilitated workshops in the Research and Development (R&D) and Production departments. Furthermore, the identified challenges are reflected to the findings presented in <b>knowledge</b> and <b>information</b> management literature. The results gained from the company case study were well {{in line with the}} findings in the literature. Three main topics, which can be generalized to cause challenges for <b>knowledge</b> and <b>information</b> management in most companies, were recognized: 1) Issues related to human behavior, individual characteristics and capabilities, different backgrounds, and professional vocabulary; 2) Codifying tacit <b>knowledge</b> into explicit <b>information,</b> which can be saved to company information system; 3) Lack of interoperability between different information systems. The study provides the management of the case company, and other similar organizations, focus points while seeking for better <b>knowledge</b> and <b>information</b> management.

6000|$|In {{a speech}} at Springfield, {{on the night of}} the 17th, I thought I might as well attend to my own {{business}} a little, and I recalled his attention as well as I could to this charge of conspiracy to nationalize slavery. I called his attention to the fact that he had acknowledged in my hearing twice that he had carefully read the speech, and, in the language of the lawyers, as he had twice read the speech, and still had put in no plea or answer, I took a default on him. I insisted that I had a right then to renew that charge of conspiracy. Ten days afterward I met the Judge at Clinton,--that is to say, I was on the ground, but not in the discussion,--and heard him make a speech. Then he comes in with his plea to this charge, for the first time; and his plea when put in, as well as I can recollect it, amounted to this: that he never had any talk with Judge Taney or the President of the United States with regard to the Dred Scott decision before it was made. I (Lincoln) ought to know that the man who makes a charge without knowing it to be true falsifies as much as he who knowingly tells a falsehood; and, lastly, that he would pronounce the whole thing a falsehood; but, he would make no personal application of the charge of falsehood, not because of any regard for the [...] "kind, amiable, intelligent gentleman," [...] but because of his own personal self-respect! I have understood since then (but [turning to Judge Douglas] will not hold the Judge to it if he is not willing) that he has broken through the [...] "self-respect," [...] and has got to saying the thing out. The Judge nods to me that it is so. It is fortunate for me that I can keep as good-humored as I do, when the Judge acknowledges that he has been trying to make a question of veracity with me. I know the Judge is a great man, while I am only a small man, but I feel that I have got him. I demur to that plea. I waive all objections that it was not filed till after default was taken, and demur to it upon the merits. What if Judge Douglas never did talk with Chief Justice Taney and the President before the Dred Scott decision was made, does it follow that he could not have had as perfect an understanding without talking as with it? I am not disposed to stand upon my legal advantage. I am disposed to take his denial as being like an answer in chancery, that he neither had any <b>knowledge,</b> <b>information,</b> or belief in the existence of such a conspiracy. I am disposed to take his answer as being as broad as though he had put it in these words. And now, I ask, even if he had done so, have not I a right to prove it on him, and to offer the evidence of more than two witnesses, by whom to prove it; and if the evidence proves the existence of the conspiracy, does his broader answer denying all <b>knowledge,</b> <b>information,</b> or belief, disturb the fact? It can only show that he was used by conspirators, and was not a leader of them.|$|E
