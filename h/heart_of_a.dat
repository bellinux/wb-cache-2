5|$|Angelou {{does not}} begin to create her own {{narrative}} until The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman, which depends less upon the conventions of fiction than her previous books. For example, there is less dialog and fewer dramatic episodes. The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman is more uplifting than its predecessors due to Angelou's resolution of her conflict between her duties as {{a mother and her}} success as a performer.|$|E
5|$|<b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman {{reached a}} peak {{position}} of number four on Billboard Top Blues Albums chart. By November 1999, the album had {{remained on the}} chart for seventeen weeks, and remained at number twelve. In 1999, James had five albums chart in the United States: Life, Love & the Blues, <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman, 12 Songs of Christmas (1998), {{as well as two}} compilation albums: Best of Etta James, and Her Best (1997).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman (1981) is an {{autobiography}} by American writer Maya Angelou. The {{book is the}} fourth installment in Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman recounts events in Angelou's life between 1957 and 1962 and follows her travels to California, New York City, Cairo, and Ghana as she raises her teenage son, becomes a published author, becomes active {{in the civil rights}} movement, and becomes romantically involved with a South African anti-apartheid fighter. One of the most important themes of The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman is motherhood, as Angelou continues to raise her son. The book ends with her son leaving for college and Angelou looking forward to newfound independence and freedom.|$|E

5|$|Angelou's {{primary role}} in Singin' and Swingin' and Gettin' Merry Like Christmas was stage performer, but in The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman she changes {{from someone who}} uses others' method of expression—the songs and dances of the African, Caribbean, and African-American oral tradition—to a writer. Angelou makes this {{decision}} for political reasons as she becomes more involved with the civil rights movement, and {{so that she can}} care for her son. For the first time in Angelou's autobiographies, she begins to think of herself as a writer and recounts her literary development. Angelou begins to identify with other Black women writers {{for the first time in}} The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman. She has been influenced by several writers since her childhood, but this is the first time she mentions female authors. Up to this point, her identification has been with male writers; her new affiliations with female writers is due to her emerging feminism.|$|E
5|$|Following its release, 12 Songs of Christmas {{reached a}} peak {{position}} of number five on Billboard Top Blues Albums chart. In 1999, James had five albums chart in the United States: Life, Love & the Blues, 12 Songs of Christmas, <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman (1999), {{as well as}} two compilation albums Best of Etta James and Her Best (1997).|$|E
5|$|Like Angelou's {{previous}} volumes, {{the book}} {{has been described as}} autobiographical fiction, though most critics, as well as Angelou, have characterized it as autobiography. Although most critics consider Angelou's first autobiography I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings more favorably, The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman has received positive reviews. It was chosen as an Oprah's Book Club selection in 1997.|$|E

5|$|After {{learning}} of Ventus' state, Aqua brings {{his body to}} the Land of Departure, which she transforms into Castle Oblivion to ensure Ventus will not be disturbed. Back at Radiant Garden, Aqua senses Xehanort possessing Terra's body. When Terra tries {{to regain control of}} his body, Xehanort impales himself with his own Keyblade, causing him to sink into the realm of darkness. Aqua dives into the realm and rescues Terra, but becomes trapped. Ansem the Wise finds Xehanort still possessing Terra's body, while Ventus' heart reconnects with and rests inside the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> young Sora.|$|E
5|$|Although Wakaw had a {{population}} of only 400, it sat at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> densely populated area of rural townships and had its own district court. It was also easily accessible to Saskatoon, Prince Albert and Humboldt, places where the Court of King's Bench sat. The local people were mostly immigrants, and Diefenbaker's research {{found them to be}} particularly litigious. There was already one barrister in town, and the residents were loyal to him, initially refusing to rent office space to Diefenbaker. The new lawyer was forced to rent a vacant lot and erect a two-room wooden shack.|$|E

5|$|Angelou later gained fame as {{an author}} and a poet, most notably her first autobiography, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. In her fourth autobiography, The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman, she downplays her singing career and assigns little {{importance}} to Miss Calypso. In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD {{during a period of}} customer interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with a feeling for the tradition's roots.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, Soundwave assembles a newer, more {{powerful}} chassis for Megatron, {{using it to}} resurrect him. Megatron then challenges Starscream and his loyalists for leadership of the Decepticons, kills his soldiers, defeats him and frees the Combaticons. He then leads a full-scale assault on the Autobot stronghold {{in the ruins of}} Iacon, where the massive Decepticon Trypticon's remains are kept. Megatron and his soldiers invade the facility and he takes Trypticon's power core, the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> transformer. He informs Trypticon that he is not being rescued as he , but he congratulates him for destroying Iacon City and thousands more Autobots. Trypticon is then transformed into the Nemesis, the Decepticon flagship.|$|E
5|$|Ravenpaw's Path {{is another}} trilogy which is centred around former ThunderClan {{apprentice}} Ravenpaw {{and his life}} on the farm with the farm cat Barley after the events of The Darkest Hour. Holmes has said that the series takes place {{in the second half of}} the year between the original series and The New Prophecy series, soon after Firestar and Sandstorm return to the Clan in Firestar's Quest. The three books are Shattered Peace, A Clan in Need, and The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Warrior, which were released on 3 August 2010.|$|E

5|$|Some teleosts are parasites. Remoras {{have their}} front dorsal fins {{modified}} into large suckers {{with which they}} cling onto a host animal such as a whale, sea turtle, shark or ray, but this is probably a commensal rather than parasitic arrangement because both remora and host benefit from the removal of ectoparasites and loose flakes of skin. More harmful are the catfish that enter the gill chambers of fish and feed on their blood and tissues. The snubnosed eel, though usually a scavenger, sometimes bores into the flesh of a fish, and has been found inside the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shortfin mako shark.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman is {{the first}} time Angelou {{identifies}} with another female African-American writer. Her early literary influences were men, including James Weldon Johnson, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, and William Shakespeare. Angelou has stated that she always admired women writers like Anne Spencer, Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, and Zora Neale Hurston. Her choice of title for this book is an acknowledgment of her legacy as a Black woman writer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Woman, {{published}} in 1981, {{is the fourth}} installment of Maya Angelou's series of seven autobiographies. The success of her previous autobiographies and the publication of three volumes of poetry had brought Angelou {{a considerable amount of}} fame by 1981. And Still I Rise, her third volume of poetry, was {{published in}} 1978 and reinforced Angelou's success as a writer. Her first volume of poetry, Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water 'fore I Diiie (1971), was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize.|$|E

In a health survey conducted by The Kennel Club cardiac problems were shown to be the second leading cause of mortality in Whippets.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} envisaged that a {{war with}} Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware {{of the impact of}} a blockade on an island nation at the <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> maritime empire, they felt that economic pressure would suffice.|$|E
5|$|Travel is {{a common}} theme in American {{autobiography}} as a whole; McPherson writes that it {{is something of a}} national myth to Americans as a people.
