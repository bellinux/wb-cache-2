He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to {{dislodge}} a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap, he pronounced the wound mortal.|$|E
5|$|In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent. She had {{run away}} from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap, a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed {{together}} ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, {{and in the second}} half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.|$|E

25|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot of running water. Rihanna is then {{presented}} undressing and climbing into a bathtub. Throughout {{the rest of the}} video, the singer is presented nude in the tub full of cloudy green water; subtle camera angles protect her modesty. Rihanna is shown wearing little make-up and with long hair tangled and wet over one side of her face. The singer seems morose and sad as she occasionally flickers her eyes to the ceiling and puts her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands, showing off long manicured nails and a diamond stud earring. The low-key video also features Mikky Ekko, who performs his parts of the song separately including scenes of him {{perched on the edge of}} a different bathtub, gazing into a mirror, in front of an unlit fireplace, and sitting on a grand chair. The video switches between the pair throughout the course of the video until it concludes with a single tear falling from Rihanna's eye as she sinks lower into the bathtub.|$|E

500|$|Media {{and public}} {{reaction}} to the marriage was negative and cynical. Some commentators believed Jackson was marrying a person he did not love, and Rowe was having a baby {{who may not have}} been biologically Jackson's. The Daily Mirror, a British tabloid newspaper, published a photograph of Rowe on the balcony of an Australian hotel. In it, she is seen holding her <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands. One Jackson biographer stated that the woman's dismayed and exasperated pose was most probably due to the excessive presence of paparazzi below. The Daily Mirror, however, ran the photograph while mockingly proclaiming, [...] "Oh, God! I've Just Married Michael Jackson." ...|$|E
500|$|Later {{experiments}} were devised {{to test the}} mother-child bond with mothers who had themselves been reared in isolation as infants. This early deprivation {{was found to have}} retarded the mothers' emotional development and her ability to engage in intercourse and in turn become pregnant. In response, Harlow and his colleagues created an apparatus to impregnate these mothers they named a [...] "rape rack". Harlow found that once these monkeys gave birth, they cared little for their offspring writing, [...] "these monkey mothers that had never experienced love of any kind were devoid of love for their infants". While some mothers simply ignored their children, Harlow characterized others as [...] "evil" [...] and abusive and in some instances reported them [...] "crushing the infant's face to the floor, chewing off the infant's feet and fingers, and in one case... putting the infant's <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mouth and crushing it like an eggshell".|$|E
500|$|The {{first draft}} {{libretto}} that Illica produced for Puccini resurfaced in 2000 after being lost for many years. It contains considerable differences {{from the final}} libretto, relatively minor {{in the first two}} acts but much more appreciable in the third, where the description of the Roman dawn that opens the third act is much longer, and Cavaradossi's tragic aria, the eventual [...] "E lucevan le stelle", has different words. The 1896 libretto also offers a different ending, in which Tosca does not die but instead goes mad. In the final scene, she cradles her lover's <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> lap and hallucinates that she and her Mario are on a gondola, and that she is asking the gondolier for silence. Sardou refused to consider this change, insisting that as in the play, Tosca must throw herself from the parapet to her death. Puccini agreed with Sardou, telling him that the mad scene would have the audiences anticipate the ending and start moving towards the cloakrooms. Puccini pressed his librettists hard, and Giacosa issued a series of melodramatic threats to abandon the work. The two librettists were finally able to give Puccini what they hoped was a final version of the libretto in 1898.|$|E

500|$|The promotional {{music video}} for [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] was {{directed}} by Daf Palfrey and appears on the DVD version of the band's 'greatest hits' album [...] The video begins with silent footage of five characters, who appear in a small white rectangle in {{the centre of the}} screen against a black background. The text [...] "I am like a film strip ... and like a child ... in a thousand lunar parks ... someone is always ... cranking the handle" [...] appears as the video cuts between shots of each person. [...] "Ice Hockey Hair" [...] begins playing approximately 17 seconds into the video. Each character is again seen in a white rectangle in the centre of the screen followed by a shot of a pair of hands holding a strip of photos of that particular person during which red text is displayed showing the character's name.

[...] "The wife" [...] is twice shown ripping a photograph of her and [...] "The husband", while [...] "The mistress" [...] is seen sitting on the lap of [...] "The husband" [...] in two shots. After 1 minute and 6 seconds the Super Furry Animals are shown playing along to the track on a rotating dancefloor surrounded by photo booths and several dancers in dark clothes. During an instrumental break in the song, at 1 minute 38 seconds, two masked men are shown playing table tennis on another rotating dancefloor with two large fluorescent purple circles in the background. The five characters are then seen walking around the band and stepping into the photo booths that surround them. The text [...] "Act 1: The kiss" [...] is shown, after which footage of the Super Furry Animals playing along to the track is intercut with shots of the characters. [...] "The husband" [...] and [...] "The mistress" [...] kiss while a strip of photos is seen being passed through a pair of hands and [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown using a video camera. The characters move to different photo booths and the title [...] "Act 2: The stalking" [...] is displayed. Shots of [...] "The stalker" [...] and [...] "The wife" [...] are then intercut with shots of the band. The characters again change booths and the title [...] "Act 3: The murder" [...] is shown. After quick jump cuts between shots of the band, the masked men playing table tennis and the five characters, [...] "The voyeur" [...] is shown pointing his video camera at the motionless body of [...] "The mistress" [...] which is laid in a bathtub covered in film stock. More footage of the band follows before [...] "The husband" [...] is shown motionless of the floor, surrounded by a white tape outline. The video ends with more jump cuts between the band, the masked table tennis players and the five named characters.|$|E

2500|$|She has lectured widely {{about her}} {{first-hand}} {{experiences of the}} anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which allegedly motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes.

This {{has proved to be}} a further point of criticism and controversy among animal activists who have questioned the congruence of a career built on animal slaughter alongside Grandin's claims of compassion and respect for animals. While her designs are widely used throughout the slaughterhouse industry, her claim of compassion for the animals is that because of her autism she can see the animals' reality from their viewpoint, that when she holds an animal's <b>head</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> hands as it is being slaughtered, she feels a deep, godlike connection to them.|$|E
