40|$|An {{overview}} {{is provided}} of the methodologies used {{in determining the}} time to steady state for Phase 1 multiple dose studies. These methods include NOSTASOT (no-statistical-significance-of-trend), Helmert contrasts, spline (quadratic) regression, <b>effective</b> <b>half</b> <b>life</b> for accumulation, nonlinear mixed effects modeling, and Bayesian approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. For each methodology we describe its advantages and disadvantages. The first two methods do not require any distributional assumptions for the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters and are limited to average assessment of steady state. Also spline regression which provides both average and individual assessment of time to steady state does not require any distributional assumptions for the PK parameters. On the other hand, nonlinear mixed effects modeling and Bayesian hierarchical modeling which allow for the estimation of both population and subject-specific estimates of time to steady state do require distributional assumptions on PK parameters. The current investigation presents eight case studies for which the time to steady state was assessed using the above mentioned methodologies. The time to steady state estimates obtained from nonlinear mixed effects modeling, Bayesian hierarchal approach, <b>effective</b> <b>half</b> <b>life,</b> and spline regression were generally similar...|$|E
40|$|The 210 Pb-content of lichen-carpets {{collected}} in Northern Sweden (62. 3 " N, 12. 4 " E) from 1961 until 1969 has been studied. The analytical method used was wet ashing with nitric and perchloric acid and spontaneous deposition of zlOPo on silver discs. The a-activity of zlOPo {{was measured with}} a silicon-surface-barrier detector. No maximum P 1 oPb-content in lichen was found in 1963 - 1965 which could be com-pared with that previously found for 137 Cs, 55 Fe and 90 Sr, which were released by nuclear-weapons tests during 1961 - 62. Thus there was no special evidence of any release of significant amounts of artificial,loPb into the atmosphere by these tests. The average Z'OPb-area-content of lichen during 1962 - 68 {{was found to be}} 16 k 2 nCi/m 2 and the deposition rate of 210 Pb was estimated to be 1. 7 k 0. 3 nCi/mz a. The <b>effective</b> <b>half</b> <b>life</b> for elimination of,loPb from the lichen-carpet was estimated to be 7 + 2 a.

40|$|Peripheral {{regulation}} of gastric acid secretion is {{initiated by the}} release of gastrin from the G cell. Gastrin then stimulates the cholecystokinin-B receptor on the enterochromaffin-like cell beginning a calcium signaling cascade. An exocytotic release of histamine follows with concomitant activation of a C 1 - current. The released histamine begins the H 2 -receptor mediated sequence {{of events in the}} parietal cell, which results in activation of the gastric H+/K+ - ATPase. This enzyme is the final common pathway of acid secretion. The H+/K+ - ATPase is composed of two subunits: the larger alpha-subunit couples ion transport to hydrolysis of ATP, the smaller beta-subunit is required for appropriate assembly of the holoenzyme. Both the membrane and extracytoplasmic domain contain the ion transport pathway, and therefore, this region is the target for the antisecretory drugs of the post-H 2 era. The 100 kDa alpha-subunit has probably 10 membrane spanning segments with, therefore, five extracytoplasmic loops. The 35 kDA beta-subunit has a single membrane spanning segment, and most of this protein is extracytoplasmic with the six or seven N glycosylation consensus sequences occupied. Omeprazole is an acid-accumulated, acid-activated, prodrug that binds covalently to two cysteine residues at positions 813 (or 822) and 892, accessible from the acidic face of the pump. Lansoprazole binds to cys 321, 813 (or 822) and 892; pantoprazole binds to cys 813 and 822. The common binding site for these drugs (cys 813 or 822) is responsible for the inhibition of acid transport. Covalent inhibition of the acid pump improves control of acid secretion, but since the <b>effective</b> <b>half</b> <b>life</b> of the inhibition in man is about 48 hr, full inhibition of acid secretion, perhaps necessary for eradication of Helicobacter pylori in combination with a single antibiotic, will require prolongation of the effect of this class of drug...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: <b>Effective</b> <b>half</b> <b>life</b> of I- 131 (Teff) in {{patients}} with differentiated thyroid cancer treated by I- 131 is must-know value for dose calculation and determination of release time from isolation room. There has been no report about Teff in Koreans. Thus, author tried to measure dose rate without radiation exposure to faculty members and calculated Teff. Methods: Probe of radiation survey meter was fixed at the wall of isolation room, and body of survey meter was placed outside the room. With this simple arrangement, author could measure radiation frequently without radiation exposure to faculty members in 68 patient (F= 55, M= 13, age= 47 ± 13. 7) treated by I- 131 (3. 7 ∼ 7. 4 GBq) for differentiated thyroid cancer from Jan 2006 to Dec 2006. From this data, Teff, 48 hr retention rate, and the time necessary to whole body retention of I- 131 become less than 1. 1 GBq were calculated. Serum creatinine levels were measured before and after thyroid hormone withdrawal. Results: Teff was 15. 4 ± 4. 3 hr (9. 4 ∼ 32. 5 hr). There was a loose correlation between Teff and serum creatinine concentration (r= 0. 45). 48 hr retention was 4. 9 ± 4. 2 % (1 ∼ 23 %). Time necessary to whole body retention of I- 131 become less than 1. 1 GBq was calculated as 47. 1 ± 13. 2 hr for 9. 25 GBq, 42. 1 ± 11. 9 hr for 7. 4 GBq, 35. 7 ± 10. 0 hr for 5. 55 GBq, and 26. 7 ± 7. 5 hr for 3. 7 GBq dose of I- 131. Conclusion: Author successfully measured radiation dose rates in isolated patients treated by high dose of I- 131 without radiation exposure to the faculty members with simple arrangemen...|$|E
