It is necessary to build rational virtual prototype model, analysis dynamic performance of {{belt conveyor}}. Comparing with traditional physical prototyping and experimental way, shorter design cycle and lower development costs will be got by using virtual prototype. It is helpful to choose the best design which is rational in technique, safe and reliable in running, feasible in economy. Considered actual working conditions, a virtual prototype model is built and validated by dynamics analysis. Three starting methods including <b>direct</b> <b>starting</b> mode, traditional Harrison method and soft starting are compared. The simulation results of virtual prototype show that <b>direct</b> <b>starting</b> method will lead to higher dynamic tension extreme value and larger fluctuation, dynamic tension is significantly reduced with the traditional Harrison method, and the average dynamic tension of soft starting consider the actual condition is dropped to minimum and the whole system is more stable...|$|E
40|$|BOG (Boil off Gas) {{compressor}} {{deals with}} the gas evaporated from the LNG storage tank. Its working temperature is lower than - 120 â„ƒ. There {{are two types of}} starting process for BOG compressor: <b>Direct</b> <b>Starting</b> and No-load Starting. During the starting process, the temperature on cylinder will change rapidly and result in additional thermal stress to some parts on the cylinder, especially to the bolted joints on the cylinder head. In this paper, transient Finite Element thermal analysis is proposed on the cylinder with some improvement of the boundary condition settings, such as the consideration of the ice increase on the cylinder wall. Then, the theoretical and transient FE analysis are proposed subject to the bolted joints of the cylinder head in two starting process. Result shows that the maximum temperature difference on the cylinder is 81. 5 â„ƒ during direct starting; while it could decrease to 60. 9 â„ƒin No-Load Starting. Along the bolted joints in the cylinder head, the maximum temperature difference will be up to 52 â„ƒ in <b>direct</b> <b>starting</b> and 45 â„ƒ in No-Load Starting. The preload increases rapidly over 60 % and its mean tensile stress on the bolt is near to the yield strength. Besides, the preload are distributed unevenly during the starting process. The maximum uneven rate is 20 % in <b>Direct</b> <b>Starting</b> and 15 % in No-Load Starting. It shows that No-Load Starting could offer a more stable starting process. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis, a preload adjustment method is proposed to ensure the safety and validity of bolted joints on BOG compressor...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTwo {{new methods}} to {{identify}} the mechanical parameters in induction motor based field oriented drives are presented in this paper. The identified parameters are: the moment of inertia and the viscous damping coefficient. The proposed methods {{are based on the}} adaptive linear neuron (ADALINE) networks. The two parameters are derived and optimized during the online training process. During the identification phase, the motor torque is controlled by the well-known field oriented control strategy. This torque is subjected to variations in order to obtain mechanical speed transients. The two proposed methods are simple to implement compared to the previous techniques. They require only the stator current and mechanical speed measurements. Finally, the effectiveness of the two methods and the accuracy of the derived parameters are proven experimentally by two <b>direct</b> <b>starting</b> tests. The originality of this work is the building of a model representation that it is suitable for implementation with ADALINE networks. This leads to a simple implementation and ease of mechanical parameters identification...|$|E
40|$|Differential {{diagnosis}} and treatment planning of speech sound disorders (SSD) {{is one of the}} major bottlenecks in the field of pediatric speech-language pathology. The current study comprised the development and evaluation of a learning task designed to provide insight in different (sub-) processes involved in the acquisition of sensori-motor representations of novel speech sound units. Six normally developing children (aged 4. 1 - 7. 8 yrs) and five children with SSD (aged 4. 3 - 7. 5 yrs) participated in the pilot study. The learning paradigm comprised a repetition task of three speech sound units that are not present in the children’s mother tongue ([g], [ʃ], and the consonant cluster /ml/, followed by [a]) in four conditions of repetition and variation. Statistical analyses revealed significant main effects of learning as well as significant differences between groups, but no group by learning interactions. Detailed analysis of the individual data show underlying profiles to vary widely per child with SSD. Furthermore, results highlighted the role of prosody in SSD, suggesting a trade-off between accuracy at the segmental and supra-segmental levels. These preliminary results are promising for the profiling of SSD and suggest that a detailed assessment of the acquisition of novel sensori-motor representations may provide <b>direct</b> <b>starting</b> points for therapy...|$|E

40|$|In 1960 the Japanese film studio Shochiku Co. {{announced}} 2 ̆ 2 the Ofuna New Wave 2 ̆ 2 {{a revolution}} in Japanese filmmaking similar to France’s immensely popular Nouvelle Vague. This paper attempts to discover whether this Ofuna New Wave was simply a marketing ploy Shochiku developed {{in order to attract}} a larger youth market, or whether it constitutes a legitimate artistic movement along the lines of France’s New Wave. The methods used were a combination of primary research of four Shochiku films released in 1960 as well as secondary historical research regarding the studio and time period. The Shochiku films were then compared to films made earlier in Japan, as well as those from other studios in order to ascertain whether the Ofuna New Wave constitutes a cohesive movement or if other films might better exemplify the ideal of a Japanese filmmaking revolution. This study found that while many Shochiku directors would go on to create revolutionary works, this early Ofuna period does not constitute a legitimate break from the style occurring in other studios in Japan at the same time. Many scholars of Japanese film have accepted the Ofuna New Wave as a <b>direct</b> <b>starting</b> point for what has become known more generally as the Japanese New Wave. This paper offers an alternate history that, while not definitive, could be a starting point for further scholarship into early 1960 s Japanese filmmaking...|$|E
