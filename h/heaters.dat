25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the <b>heater</b> where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the <b>heater</b> directly, the outer PID controller sets a <b>heater</b> temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the <b>heater</b> using a thermocouple attached to the <b>heater.</b> The inner controller's error term is the difference between this <b>heater</b> temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the <b>heater.</b> Its output controls the actual <b>heater</b> to stay near this setpoint.|$|R

40|$|This is {{the final}} report of a three-year Laboratory-Directed Research and Development (LDRD) project at the Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). This {{research}} concentrated on the time dependence of the <b>heater,</b> induced-turbulence, and electron-density profiles excited in the ionosphere by a powerful radio-frequency <b>heater</b> wave. The macroscopic density {{is driven by the}} ponderomotive pressure and the density self-consistently determines the <b>heater</b> propagation. For typical parameters of the current Arecibo <b>heater,</b> a dramatic quasi-periodic behavior was found. For about 50 ms after turn-on of the <b>heater</b> wave, the turbulence is concentrated at the first standing-wave maximum of the <b>heater</b> near reflection altitude. From 50 [...] 100 ms the standing-wave pattern drops by about 1 [...] 2 km in altitude and the quasi-periodicity reappears at the higher altitudes with a period of roughly 50 ms. This behavior is due to the half-wavelength density depletion grating that is set up by the ponderomotive pressure at the maxima of the <b>heater</b> standing-wave pattern. Once the grating is established the <b>heater</b> can no longer propagate to higher altitudes. The grating is then unsupported by the <b>heater</b> at these altitudes and decays, allowing the <b>heater</b> to propagate again and initiate another cycle. For stronger <b>heater</b> powers, corresponding to the Arecibo upgrade and the HAARP <b>heater</b> now under construction, the effects are much more dramatic...|$|R
