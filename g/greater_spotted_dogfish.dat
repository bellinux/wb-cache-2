Lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> are not a commercial by-catch, and are discarded immediately after sorting. During 1994 the contents of 1094 dogfish stomachs were analysed.

5000|$|The idea of {{creating}} a Danish fisheries museum with an aquarium came from the journalist Hakon Mielche in 1941. In 1962, a planning committee was formed in Esbjerg which soon led to the collection of artefacts. Building began in 1966, allowing the privately owned institution to be {{opened to the public}} in 1968. From the start, the museum contained a fisheries exhibition and a saltwater aquarium. A sealarium was added in 1976. In 1989 a start was made on an outdoor exhibition which was later extended. The museum established a research unit in 1994, followed in 2000 by the Centre for Maritime and Regional Studies (Center for Maritime og Regionale Studier), a cooperative venture with the University of Southern Denmark. In 1999, a five-storey museum building with almost 2000 m2 of floor space was inaugurated, housing a new permanent exhibition, a library, storage rooms, an archive and offices. Provision was also made for temporary exhibitions while the educational facilities were modernized. A new saltwater aquarium was installed in 2002 and a new [...] "sealarium" [...] (exhibit for seals) in 2013. The largest aquarium tank contains 100000 L saltwater and is home to species such as cod, halibut, conger eel, gilthead seabream, <b>greater</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> and thornback ray, while the sealarium contains 500000 L and is home to grey seal and harbour seal.|$|E

The catch compositions of the fishery taking these species is described and analysed in terms of landings and discards. Only two of these species are sufficiently abundant to be recorded in the landings ({{blackmouth catshark}} and <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish).</b> The length compositions {{in terms of both}} landings and discards were analysed for these two species. <b>Spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> catches reached similar proportions to those of the target species in the coastal fishery (red and striped red mullet) and in the shelf trawl fishery (European hake); whereas the catches of blackmouth catshark and velvet belly were a small proportion of the total catch in the slope fishery for red shrimp. The size range of the <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> was between 7 and 53 cm TL. Juveniles and adults were distributed throughout the whole area, although adults appeared to be more abundant in the coastal zone. The length distribution of blackmouth catshark showed a trend of increasing size with depth; the size range was between 9 and 63 cm TL. For both species, individuals smaller than 35 cm TL were usually discarded. Only 25 % by number and 60 % by weight of the total <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> catch was landed. For the total blackmouth catshark catch, the corresponding percentages were 10 % by number and 35 % by weight.

40|$|Dermal denticles {{are unique}} tooth-like {{structures}} {{embedded in the}} skin of sharks and rays that protect them from predators and ectoparasites, reduce mechanical abrasion and possibly minimize swimming-induced drag. Here, we show that juvenile lesser <b>spotted</b> <b>dogfish</b> (Scyliorhinus canicula) also use this body armour to anchor food items near their tail so that bite-sized pieces can be torn away by rapid jaw and head movements. This scale-rasp behaviour is novel among fishes and suggests a new role for skin in the feeding ecology of sharks. Scale rasping may be important ecologically because it could function to increase the dietary breadth and growth potential of juveniles...|$|R
