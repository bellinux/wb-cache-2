25|$|Spironolactone is not metabolized by CYP3A4, {{unlike the}} related drug <b>eplerenone.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> is {{specifically}} indicated for post-MI reduction of cardiovascular risk.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{antiandrogen}} properties, spironolactone {{can cause}} effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males. For this reason, men are typically not prescribed spironolactone for any {{longer than a}} short period of time, e.g., for an acute exacerbation of heart failure. A newer drug, <b>eplerenone,</b> has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of heart failure, and lacks the antiandrogen effects of spironolactone. As such, it is far more suitable for men for whom long-term medication is being chosen. However, <b>eplerenone</b> may not be as effective as spironolactone or the related drug canrenone in reducing mortality from heart failure.|$|E
25|$|Spironolactone {{is closely}} {{structurally}} related to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and <b>eplerenone,</b> {{as well as}} to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).|$|E
25|$|The RALES trial {{showed that}} the {{addition}} of spironolactone can improve mortality, particularly in severe cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction less than 25%.) The related drug <b>eplerenone</b> was shown in the EPHESUS trial to have a similar effect, and it is specifically labelled for use in decompensated heart failure complicating acute myocardial infarction. While the antagonism of aldosterone will decrease the effects of sodium and water retention, {{it is thought that}} the main mechanism of action is by antagonizing the deleterious effects of aldosterone on cardiac remodeling.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> {{is being}} {{explored}} {{as a treatment}} for central serous retinopathy. It is expected that as an antimineralocorticoid, <b>eplerenone</b> can inhibit over-activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor pathway in the choroid. Separate trials are underway to determine if there are beneficial effects of <b>eplerenone</b> for acute and chronic CSR.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> {{can be used}} {{individually}} or {{in combination with other}} medications to treat hypertension. In an 8-week trial with 417 patients with mild to moderate hypertension, <b>eplerenone</b> decreased systolic and diastolic blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner. <b>Eplerenone</b> effectively reduces blood pressure compared to agents such as spironolactone, enalapril, losartan and amlodipine, but its effect on mortality is still generally unknown.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> was {{developed}} by Pharmacia Corporation, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2002. It was marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Inspra. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the drug {{for sale in the}} United States in 2002. <b>Eplerenone</b> is currently approved for sale in the US, EU, Netherlands and Japan. <b>Eplerenone</b> costs an estimated $2.93 per day when treating congestive heart failure and $5.86 per day when treating hypertension.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> is an antimineralocorticoid, or an {{antagonist}} of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). <b>Eplerenone</b> is {{also known}} chemically as 9,11α-epoxy-7α-methoxycarbonyl-3-oxo-17α-pregn-4-ene-21,17-carbolactone and [...] "was derived from spironolactone {{by the introduction of}} a 9α,11α-epoxy bridge and by substitution of the 17α-thoacetyl group of spironolactone with a carbomethoxy group". The drug controls high blood pressure by binding the aldosterone hormone to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) in epithelial tissues, such as the kidney. This helps to increase blood volume and regulate blood pressure. It has 10- to 20-fold lower affinity for the MR relative to spironolactone, and is less potent in vivo as an antimineralocorticoid. However, in contrast to spironolactone, <b>eplerenone</b> has little affinity for the androgen, progesterone, and glucocorticoid receptors. It also has more consistently observed non-genomic antimineralocorticoid effects relative to spironolactone (see membrane mineralocorticoid receptor). <b>Eplerenone</b> differs from spironolactone in its extensive metabolism, with a short half-life and inactive metabolites.|$|E
5000|$|Finerenone — nonsteroidal {{and more}} potent and {{selective}} than either <b>eplerenone</b> or spironolactone ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> is {{contraindicated}} {{in patients}} with hyperkalaemia, severe renal impairment (creatinine Cl less than 30 ml/min), or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C). The manufacturer of <b>eplerenone</b> also contraindicates ( [...] relative C.I. [...] ) concomitant treatment with ketoconazole, itraconazole or other potassium-sparing diuretics (though the manufacturer still considers taking these drugs to be absolute C.I.) Potential benefits should be weighted against possible risks.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> — {{much more}} {{selective}} than spironolactone on target, but somewhat less potent and efficacious ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> is {{specifically}} indicated for {{the reduction of}} risk of cardiovascular death in people with heart failure and left ventricular dysfunction within 3-14 days of an acute myocardial infarction, in combination with standard therapies and as treatment against hypertension. A variant of the spirolactone group, <b>Eplerenone</b> was developed to contradict the depletion of essential potassium and magnesium levels that are common amongst other mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. It is a more expensive alternative to spironolactone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> is {{primarily}} metabolized by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP3A4. Thus the potential exists for adverse drug interactions with other drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4. Specifically, the concomitant {{use of the}} CYP3A4 potent inhibitors ketoconazole and itraconazole is contraindicated. Other CYP3A4 inhibitors including erythromycin, saquinavir, and verapamil should be used with caution. Other drugs that increase potassium concentrations may {{increase the risk of}} hyperkalemia associated with <b>eplerenone</b> therapy, including salt substitutes, potassium supplements and other potassium-sparing diuretics.|$|E
50|$|ST2 is {{an active}} {{participant}} in the cardiac remodeling pathway and could identify which patients will respond to <b>Eplerenone,</b> or other therapies that reverse myocardial fibrosis.|$|E
50|$|The {{treatment}} for hyperaldosteronism {{depends on the}} underlying cause. In people with a single benign tumor (adenoma), surgical removal (adrenalectomy) may be curative. This is usually performed laparoscopically, through several very small incisions. For people with hyperplasia of both glands, successful treatment is often achieved with spironolactone or <b>eplerenone,</b> drugs that block the effect of aldosterone. With its antiandrogen effect, spironolactone drug therapy may {{have a range of}} effects in males, including sometimes gynecomastia. These symptoms usually do not occur with <b>eplerenone</b> drug therapy.|$|E
50|$|Aldosterone antagonists (spironolactone or <b>eplerenone)</b> {{may be used}} {{if there}} is {{evidence}} of left ventricular dysfunction after an MI, ideally after beginning treatment with an ACE inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|Aldosterone {{receptor}} antagonists are {{not recommended}} as first-line agents for blood pressure, but spironolactone and <b>eplerenone</b> are both {{used in the}} treatment of heart failure and resistant hypertension.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eplerenone</b> is a steroidal antimineralocorticoid of the spirolactone {{group that}} is used as an adjunct in the {{management}} of chronic heart failure. Classed as a selective aldosterone receptor antagonist (SARA), it is similar to the diuretic spironolactone, though it is much more selective for the mineralocorticoid receptor in comparison (i.e., does not possess any antiandrogen, progestogen, glucocorticoid, or estrogenic effects), and is specifically marketed for reducing cardiovascular risk in patients following myocardial infarction. <b>Eplerenone</b> is a potassium-sparing diuretic, meaning that it helps the body get rid of water but still keep potassium.|$|E
50|$|Difficult or {{resistant}} {{cases of}} hypokalemia may be amenable to a potassium-sparing diuretic, such as amiloride, triamterene, spironolactone, or <b>eplerenone.</b> Concomittant hypomagnesemia will inhibit potassium replacement, as magnesium is a cofactor for potassium uptake.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{antiandrogen}} properties, spironolactone {{can cause}} effects associated with low androgen levels and hypogonadism in males.

50|$|Adverse {{effects of}} {{aldosterone}} {{occur in the}} heart and brain, due to changes in water retention and excretion of sodium and potassium. Common adverse drug reactions (ADRs) {{associated with the use}} of <b>eplerenone</b> include: hyperkalaemia, hypotension, dizziness, altered renal function, and increased creatinine concentration. <b>Eplerenone</b> may have a lower incidence than spironolactone of sexual side effects such as feminization, gynecomastia, impotence, low sex drive and reduction of size of male genitalia. This is because other antimineralocorticoids have structural elements of the progesterone molecule, causing progestogenic and antiandrogenic outcomes. When considering taking these medicines, it is important to note the variations in their ability to offset the nongenomic effects of aldosterone.|$|E
50|$|Spironolactone {{is closely}} {{structurally}} related to other clinically used spirolactones such as canrenone, potassium canrenoate, drospirenone, and <b>eplerenone,</b> {{as well as}} to the never-marketed spirolactones SC-5233 (6,7-dihydrocanrenone; 7α-desthioacetylspironolactone), SC-8109 (19-nor-6,7-dihydrocanrenone), spiroxasone, prorenone (SC-23133), mexrenone (SC-25152, ZK-32055), dicirenone (SC-26304), spirorenone (ZK-35973), and mespirenone (ZK-94679).|$|E
50|$|Aldosterone can be {{inhibited}} by antialdosteronic {{drugs such}} as spironolactone and <b>eplerenone.</b> In the chance that aldosterone activity is too high to be metabolically beneficial salt and fluid build up can occur which may stiffen the heart muscle increasing the risk of cardiovascular malfunction.|$|E
5000|$|Aldosterone antagonists: spironolactone, {{which is}} a {{competitive}} antagonist of aldosterone. Aldosterone normally adds sodium channels in the principal cells of the collecting duct and late distal tubule of the nephron. Spironolactone prevents aldosterone from entering the principal cells, preventing sodium reabsorption. Similar agents are <b>eplerenone</b> and potassium canreonate.|$|E
5000|$|Finerenone (INN, USAN) (developmental {{code name}} BAY-94-8862) is a nonsteroidal antimineralocorticoid {{that is in}} phase III {{clinical}} trials {{for the treatment of}} chronic heart failure [...] It has less relative affinity to other steroid hormone receptors than currently available antimineralocorticoids such as <b>eplerenone</b> and spironolactone, which should result in fewer adverse effects like gynaecomastia, impotence, and low sex drive.|$|E
50|$|While not classically {{considered}} potassium-sparing diuretics, ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) are anti-hypertensive {{drugs with}} diuretic effects that decrease renal excretion of potassium. They work by inhibiting either the production (ACEis) or effects (ARBs) of angiotensin 2. This {{results in a}} decrease in aldosterone release, which causes potassium-sparing-diuretic-like effects {{similar to those of}} the aldosterone antagonists, spironolactone and <b>eplerenone.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, various {{diseases}} and medications may decrease the body's excretion of potassium, thereby increasing {{the risk of}} potentially fatal hyperkalemia. People with kidney failure, heart failure, or diabetes should not use salt substitutes without medical advice. A manufacturer, LoSalt, has issued an advisory statement that people taking the following prescription drugs should not use a salt substitute: amiloride, triamterene, Dytac, captopril & other angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, spironolactone, and <b>eplerenone.</b>|$|E
