25|$|The new Soviet {{government}} {{was anxious to}} establish diplomatic relations with China. It had sent a representative to Beijing; the Chinese government reciprocated with its own to Moscow. Perhaps the principal reason that the Soviets had hesitated to aid the Mongolians too openly was <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>prejudicing</b> those negotiations. But by early 1921 whatever restraints there were upon open Soviet support for Mongolia had ended: China suspended talks with the Soviet government in January 1921; the Chinese government appeared to be incapable of dealing with von Ungern-Sternberg; and in early March it had refused Soviet military assistance against the White Guards. It was then that the Russians became firmly committed to the Mongolian revolution.|$|R

50|$|In Hoffman v South African Airways, {{the court}} found that people living with HIV {{constitute}} a minority, to which society has responded with intense prejudice, stigmatization and marginalization.

40|$|Mental {{illness in}} the {{university}} student population has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Students with mental illness are understandably highly reluctant to disclose their condition to others due to <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>prejudice,</b> “not blending in,” and {{a strong desire to}} appear self-reliant. This study considered whether disclosure to university support services, with all its perceived risks, had academic benefits for students with mental illness. Preliminary evidence was found that, for those students with mental illness who registered with the University’s Disability Support Service for assistance, academic achievement was significantly higher on average in the year following their joining the service. Academic retention for these students was comparable to their university peers. A number of recommendations are discussed that could accommodate for students’ learning needs, thereby benefitting those experiencing mental health difficulties...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to learn}} about the {{experience}} of caregivers/mothers providing care to infants exposed to HIV through vertical transmission. METHODS: this qualitative study used Symbolic Interactionism as the theoretical framework. A total of 39 caregivers of children exposed to HIV in follow-up at a specialized service were interviewed. Data were analyzed through inductive content analysis. RESULTS: four categories were identified that report on the lonely experience of handling the child's antiretroviral therapy, mainly {{due to a lack of}} information or incomplete information; being attentive to required care, such as the use of prophylaxis for pneumonia, vaccines, and other practices restricted to the mother-child interaction; the desire to omit the HIV out of <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>prejudice</b> and fear of the disease, considering future prospects. CONCLUSION: the HIV and the threat this infection may affect the child cause apprehension and feelings such as fear, guilt and anxiety in the caregivers. Healthcare workers need to work together with mothers so they are able to cope with demands and distress. Only then will the treatment to avoid vertical transmission be efficient and will mother and child be supported during the process, despite apprehension with the outcome...|$|E

5000|$|Anxiety for the {{purposes}} of anxiety/uncertainty management can be described as an apprehension based on the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> negative consequences. It is more prevalent in intergroup relations because there is an added <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> appearing <b>prejudiced</b> when dealing with an outgroup. Similar to uncertainty, Gudykunst postulates that effective communication relies on managing anxiety between minimum and maximum thresholds. Once we reach our upper limit for anxiety, virtually all of our attention focuses on its source and not on effective communication. The concept of managing levels anxiety can be compared to managing eustress and distress to achieve optimum performance. The positive benefit of the optimum amount of anxiety is trust, or [...] "confidence that one will find what is desired from another rather than what is feared" [...] The negative consequence is avoidance. If we are overcome by anxiety we will simply choose not to communicate.|$|R

60|$|The {{story is}} told in Household Words, where Sir Frederick Forbes {{is said to have}} acted as judge. No date is given. In Botany Bay, {142} the legend is narrated by Mr. John Lang, who was in Sydney in 1842. He gives no date of the occurrence, and clearly embellishes the tale. In 1835, however, the {{story is told}} by Mr. Montgomery Martin in volume iv. of his History of the British Colonies. He gives the story as a proof of the acuteness of black trackers. Beyond saying that he himself was in the colony when the events and the trial occurred, he gives no date. I have conscientiously {{investigated}} the facts, by aid of the Sydney newspapers, and the notes of the judge, Sir Frederick Forbes. Fisher disappeared at the end of June, 1826, from Campbeltown. Suspicion fell on his manager, Worral. A reward was offered late in September. Late in October the constable's attention was drawn to blood-stains on a rail. Starting thence, the black trackers found Fisher's body. Worral was condemned and hanged, after confession, in February, 1827. Not a word is said about why the constable went to, and examined, the rail. But Mr. Rusden, author of a History of Australia, knew the medical attendant D. Farley (who saw Fisher's ghost, and pointed out the bloody rail), and often discussed it with Farley. Mr. Souttar, in a work on Colonial traditions, proves the point that Farley told his ghost story before the body of Fisher was found. But, for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> <b>prejudicing</b> the jury, the ghost was kept out of the trial, exactly as in the following case.|$|R
40|$|Fat bias {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{persistent}} <b>of</b> <b>prejudices</b> and can be expressed with little <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> censure. <b>Prejudice</b> against the obese can be found in many arenas of human functioning, beginning in childhood and continuing into adult life, affecting dating, mental health, employment, or acceptance into college (Brownell, Puhl, Schwartz, & Rudd, 2005). It even affects health care. Health-care professionals alter their behavior with an obese patient, providing less than optimal treatment because the equipment is not of the correct size and, more important, because professionals (including psychologists) share the prejudice. Now, our latest public health crusade, reducing obesity, has granted new credibility to the fat prejudice. It remains controversial how serious the health risk is and at what point the health risks really begin to accrue (Oliver, 2006). Few argue that as a country, the average weight of our citizens has increased steadily and that the health problems associated with obesity—for example, hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease—have also increased. It is also the case that the superobese, that is, those more than 100 lbs. overweight, have increased as a proportion of the general population. The most dependable method of producing weight loss—that is, surgery—cause...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{understand}} the perceptions of people with leprosy about disease and treatment. Methods: qualitative study conducted with nine adults in chemotherapy treatment. Data was collected through semistructured interviews and submitted to content analysis in thematic modality. Results: participants reported a concern, distrust, and resistance to accepting the diagnosis. When diagnosed, they felt shame and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> suffering <b>prejudice.</b> Living with the disease caused important changes, such as the inability to get out, to exercise or perform leisure activities, but the improvement resulting from treatment reassured them, {{and the need to}} care for a dependent care motivated them to do it.

50|$|There {{is a small}} {{community}} of Armenians in Tajikistan. The 1989 census found 5,630 Armenians in Tajikistan; however, many left {{the country in the}} years following due to hardships caused by the collapse of the Soviet Union and the following civil war in Tajikistan. Another driver for emigration was the <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> anti-Armenian <b>prejudice,</b> as seen in the 1990 Dushanbe riots which were sparked by an unfounded rumour that large numbers of Armenian refugees would be resettled there and get free housing during a period when there was a housing shortage. By the time of the 2000 census, only 995 people identifying themselves as Armenian remained, primarily in Dushanbe, Khujand, Chkalovsk, and Qurghonteppa. 57.6% could speak Armenian, 100% could speak Russian, and 14.8% could speak Tajik. According to interviews with community members, the first Armenians are believed to have arrived in Tajikistan in the 1930s. A number later rose to prominent positions in society, such as {{the former head of the}} Academy of Sciences of Tajikistan Dr. Arutyunov.|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite being curable, {{tuberculosis}} {{is still}} a stigmatized disease. Not only is TB patients' suffering due to its clinical manifestations, but also because <b>of</b> society's <b>prejudice,</b> embarrassing situations, and even self-discrimination. This study aims to investigate psychosocial experiences of patients who have completed tuberculosis treatment in Sao Carlos a municipality {{in the interior of}} Sao Paulo State, Brazil. Methods: This study, of a clinical-qualitative nature, sought to understand the meanings provided by the participants themselves. Fifteen individuals, who had successfully completed tuberculosis treatment, participated in this research. The sample size was established using the information saturation criterion. Data were collected by means of interviews with in-depth open-ended questions. Data were treated by categorizing and analyzing content according to themes. Results: Regardless of all progress, this study found that TB still causes patients to suffer from <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> transmission, social <b>prejudice,</b> and death. Despite the fact that the emotional support provided by families and healthcare professionals is considered essential to treatment adherence and completion, participants in this study reveal that friends and colleagues have distanced themselves from them for <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> contagion and/or <b>prejudice.</b> Ignorance about the disease and its transmission modes {{can be found in the}} interviewees' statements, which seems to indicate that they have become vectors of transmission of stigma themselves. Patients' medical leave from work during treatment may be due to both their health conditions and their attempt to avoid social/emotional embarrassment. There are accounts that TB has caused psychosocial damage to patients' lives and that they feel more fatigue and lassitude and have begun to pay more attention to their own health. Conclusions: Healthcare workers should be aware of the ways TB treatment affect patients' psychosocial life and develop strategies to mitigate these effects and provide opportunities for them to share their anxiety, suffering, and bio-psychosocial changes. In addition, healthcare professionals should seek to educate and, as a result, empower TB patients and their families with regard to this disease so as to break the existing vicious cycle <b>of</b> misinformation and <b>prejudice...</b>|$|R
40|$|Stigma and <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> {{discrimination}} {{are powerful}} deterrents against {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) antibody testing. Prejudice and discrimination against people living with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) are deterrents to their willingness to disclose their status and thereby avail themselves of treatment. Stigma impairs employees’ general well-being, affecting their work capacity, and thus directly impacting upon project management success. Little is known about construction workers’ prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons, and the determinants thereof. A field-administered questionnaire survey gathered data from 512 site-based construction employees in the Western Cape, South Africa. Following bivariate and regression analyses of the survey response data, a structural equations model comprising demographic factors, lifestyle risk, substance use (alcohol consumption and drug use), knowledge about HIV/AIDS, and attitudinal <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> testing is posited to explain prejudice towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons. The results indicate the following: (1) education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, attitudinal <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> testing, and <b>prejudice</b> towards HIV+ persons are determinants of discrimination against HIV+ persons; (2) education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and attitudinal <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> testing are determinants <b>of</b> <b>prejudice</b> towards HIV+ persons; (3) AIDS knowledge is predicted by level of education and ethnicity; and (4) attitudinal <b>fear</b> <b>of</b> testing is predicted by level of education, HIV/AIDS knowledge, and extent of risky lifestyle. The research confirms current knowledge about the multivariate determination <b>of</b> <b>prejudice</b> towards and discrimination against HIV+ persons. It advances this understanding by identifying and emphasizing the central role played by education and subject-specific information in such determination. Specifically, it offers {{a clearer picture of}} the direct influence of educational background and AIDS knowledge in determining both the cognitive dimension <b>of</b> <b>prejudice</b> and the behavioral manifestation of this through discrimination. This has clear implications for construction firms in their efforts at HIV/AIDS intervention management. As much of this AIDS knowledge is determined by cultural beliefs and values, there exists the need to design programs that directly and sensitively address these cultural beliefs and their likely impact on prejudice and discrimination. Likewise, prior education is also critical, both in terms of amplifying or mitigating the impact of cultural beliefs {{and in terms of the}} potential comprehension by workers of such structured media and awareness campaigns. Failure to account for these two factors and their influence on cognition and behavior would result in interventions of diminished impact and success...|$|R
