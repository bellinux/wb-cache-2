5|$|After the {{publication}} of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the cod fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. The result was The Cod Fisheries: The History of an <b>International</b> <b>Economy</b> published in 1940, 10years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, The Cod Fisheries looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, Nova Scotia and New England.|$|E

25|$|Such a Europe {{required}} a healthy Germany at its center. The postwar U.S. was an economic powerhouse that produced 50% of the world's industrial goods and an unrivaled military power with a monopoly {{of the new}} atom bomb.

Although several of the airline's domestic aircraft were originally equipped with in-flight entertainment systems, these were removed in 2005 to cut costs. US Airways implemented a similar initiative in 2008. On flights between Honolulu International Airport and Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, passengers experienced the same cabin as <b>International</b> <b>Economy</b> Class aboard Airbus A330 aircraft.|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{founding}} of the IMF, its three primary functions were: to oversee the fixed exchange rate arrangements between countries, thus helping national governments manage their exchange rates and allowing these governments to prioritise economic growth, and to provide short-term capital to aid the balance of payments. This assistance was meant {{to prevent the spread of}} international economic crises. The IMF was also intended to help mend the pieces of the <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> after the Great Depression and World War II. As well, to provide capital investments for economic growth and projects such as infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|From 1947 until 1958, the U.S. {{deliberately}} encouraged an outflow of dollars, and, from 1950 on, the United States ran {{a balance}} of payments deficit {{with the intent of}} providing liquidity for the <b>international</b> <b>economy.</b> Dollars flowed out through various U.S. aid programs: the Truman Doctrine entailing aid to the pro-U.S. Greek and Turkish regimes, which were struggling to suppress communist revolution, aid to various pro-U.S. regimes in the Third World, and most important, the Marshall Plan. From 1948 to 1954 the United States provided 16 Western European countries $17 billion in grants.|$|E

25|$|The new {{economic}} system required an accepted vehicle for investment, trade, and payments. Unlike national economies, however, the <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> lacks a central government that can issue currency and manage its use. In the past this problem had been solved through the gold standard, but {{the architects of}} Bretton Woods did not consider this option feasible for the postwar political economy. Instead, {{they set up a}} system of fixed exchange rates managed by a series of newly created international institutions using the U.S. dollar (which was a gold standard currency for central banks) as a reserve currency.|$|E
25|$|Hotan {{is a city}} of 360,000 people, 96% Uyghur and 3% Han, in Hotan Prefecture, China. Hotan Prefecture is a {{predominantly}} agricultural county and the poorest in Xinjiang, so it is a frequent source of migrant workers to wealthier Xinjiang cities like Ürümqi. Uyghurs tend to have less wealth than their Han counterparts; as a result, many Uyghurs are unemployed and subsist on Chinese social welfare benefits. The city receives few domestic tourists because of terrorism fears, but southern Xinjiang officials are trying to integrate the region into the <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> by creating a special economic zone in nearby Kashgar. Hotan had recently been celebrating the opening of the city's first passenger-train service in June.|$|E
25|$|In {{an angry}} {{response}} to Smoot–Hawley, Canada welcomed the British introduction of trade protectionism {{and a system}} of Commonwealth preference {{during the winter of}} 1931-32. It helped Canada avoid external default on their public debt during the Great Depression. Canada had a high degree of exposure to the <b>international</b> <b>economy,</b> which left Canada susceptible to any international economic downturn. The onset of the depression created critical balance of payment deficits, and it was largely the extension of imperial protection by Britain that gave Canada the opportunity to increase their exports to the British market. By 1938 Britain was importing more than twice the 1929 volume of products from Australia, while the value of products shipped from Canada more than doubled, despite the dramatic drop in prices. Thus, the British market played a vital role in helping Canada and Australia stabilize their balance of payments in the immensely difficult economic conditions of the 1930s.|$|E
40|$|The nature, {{subject matter}} and future {{direction}} of <b>International</b> Political <b>Economy</b> has been opened up for debate following interventions by Benjamin Cohen, John Hobson and special issues of the Review of <b>International</b> Political <b>Economy</b> and New Political Economy. Most contributors to the debate are dissatisfied with {{the current state of}} <b>International</b> Political <b>Economy</b> and desire to identify the ‘Big Questions’ of the 21 st century. This article argues, however, that all contributors miss the ‘Really Big Question’ of the 21 st century: the rise of a planetary labouring class of over 3 billion (and counting), living, for the most part, in poverty or near-poverty. While this class’s existence is not new (although its size is), <b>International</b> Political <b>Economy’s</b> ignorance of it is as old as the discipline’s institutional formation. This article shows that mainstream <b>International</b> Political <b>Economy’s</b> sidelining of class relations disables it from explaining the global systemic transformations that underpin changes in the relations between states and markets (<b>International</b> Political <b>Economy’s</b> traditional focus). It illustrates the long-term making of the global labouring class by discussing three examples of global systemic transformation: the rise of capitalism; the post- 1945 embedded liberalism–development project conjuncture; and contemporary globalisation...|$|R

25|$|According to Rapid Assessment surveys {{conducted}} by the World Bank Group in 2011 and 2012, business managers rank informal gifts or payments, anticompetitive practices and regulatory policy uncertainty {{high on the list}} of obstacles to creating and growing a business. These impediments have a chilling effect on foreign investment in Egypt which means that local businesses cannot be competitive in the <b>international</b> <b>economy</b> because of the high costs of raising capital. In addition, the amount of paperwork required for construction, imports, and exports is burdensome and the time for the government to process this paperwork is lengthy. Traders need to submit 8 documents to export and 10 to import—as opposed to France, for example, where only 2 documents are needed both for imports and exports. The high cost of doing business leads to fewer businesses operating within Egypt which causes unemployment. Egypt's unemployment rate reached 11.8 percent in the second quarter of 2011, down from 11.9 percent in the first quarter (although higher than last year's 8.96 percent). Additionally, there is no bankruptcy law in Egypt and entrepreneurs that fail to pay debts can face prison sentences.|$|E

500|$|By 1937 Bruce's {{attention}} {{had shifted}} {{to social and}} economic cooperation, which he believed had far greater potential for success and was of greater importance to humanity at large. He had taken {{a leading role in}} promoting agriculture, nutrition and economic cooperation through the League of Nations, working intensively with Frank McDougall and John Boyd Orr throughout the decade. In 1937 he presented a plan of [...] "economic appeasement", which built on this work and aimed to ease international tensions by reviving international trade and improving living standards in Europe through better working conditions, lower food prices, rural credits and housing assistance. Barriers to trade would gradually be reduced while European nations still recovering from the depression would be reintegrated into the <b>international</b> <b>economy.</b> In doing so he made a firm link between international trade and international peace, believing it key to unlocking world economic potential. Foreshadowing the logic of the Marshall Plan, Bruce argued that unrelieved economic and social hardship threatened to push other nations towards fascism or communism.|$|E
