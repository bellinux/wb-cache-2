40|$|This paper {{studies the}} impact of {{exogenous}} and endogenous shocks (exogenous shock is used interchangeably with external shock; <b>endogenous</b> <b>shock</b> is used interchangeably with domestic shock) on output fluctuations in post-communist countries during the 2000 s. The first part presents the analytical framework and formulates a research hypothesis. The second part presents vector autoregressive estimation and analysis model proposed by Pesaran (2004) and Pesaran and Smith (2006) that relates bank real lending, the cyclical component of output and spreads and accounts for cross-sectional dependence (CD) across the countries. Impulse response functions show that exogenous positive shock lead to a drop in output sustainability for 9 over 12 Central Eastern European countries and Russia, when the <b>endogenous</b> <b>shock</b> is mild and ambiguous. Moreover, the effect of exogenous shock is more significant during the crises. Variance decompositions show that exogenous shock {{in the aftermath of}} crisis had a substantial impact on economic activity of emerging economies. output sustainability; exogenous shock; endogenous shock; United States; USA; corporate bonds; bond spread; infinite vector autoregression; emerging economies; global crises; financial crises; external shock; domestic shock; output fluctuations; post-communist countries; Hashem Pesaran; Ronald Smith; banks; banking; real lending; cyclical components; cross-sectional dependence; impulse response functions; positive shock; Eastern Europe; Russia; Russian Federation; mild shock; ambiguous shock; variance decompositions; economic activity; Poland; Czech Republic; Slovakia; Hungary; Lithuania; Latvia; Estonia; Slovenia; Romania; Bulgaria; Ukraine; sustainable development; sustainable economy. ...|$|E
40|$|My {{thesis is}} {{comprised}} of three chapters. In the first chapter, coauthored with Stephen Spear, we study <b>endogenous</b> <b>shocks</b> driven by collective actions of managers. A good recent {{example of this is}} how the collective actions of bank managers engaging in securitization of loans ended up freezing the world financial markets in 2008. Motivated by examples like the 2008 crisis, we analyze how <b>endogenous</b> <b>shocks</b> driven by collective actions of managers impact social welfare by using a dynamic general equilibrium model. We first show that such <b>endogenous</b> <b>shocks</b> render competitive equilibrium allocations inefficient due to externalities. We establish that a socially optimal allocation can only be attained by paying managers the socially optimal wages, and this can be achieved by imposing wage taxes (or subsidies) on managers. Finally, we extend the model by allowing for information asymmetry, and show that {{it is not possible to}} attain a socially optimal (i. e., first-best) allocation. We instead examine second-best allocations. In the second chapter, I study whether coalitions of consumers are beneficial to consumers when producers have market power. I refer to coalitions of consumers as consumer unions and the number of consumers in a union as union size. By constructing an imperfect competition mode...|$|R

We show that an ensemble of equivalent systems quantitatively respond {{in a similar way}} to a similar ''external shock'', indicating roads to universality features. In contrast to Sornette et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. { 93 }, 228701 (2004) ] who seemed to find power law behaviors, in particular at long times, - a law interpreted in terms of an epidemic activity, we observe that the relaxation process can be as well seen as an exponential one that saturates toward an asymptotic state, itself different from the pre-shock state. By studying an ensemble of 111 shocks, on books or records, we show that exogenous and <b>endogenous</b> <b>shocks</b> are discriminated by their short-time behaviour: the relaxation time seems to be twice shorter in <b>endogenous</b> <b>shocks</b> than in exogenous ones.

Markets operate by balancing intrinsic levels of risk and return. This remains true {{even in the midst of}} transitory external shocks.

40|$|This study {{sheds light}} on the {{resiliency}} of competing electronic order-driven markets by investigating the time path of liquidity after a large <b>endogenous</b> <b>shock</b> {{by means of an}} intra-day event study. We confirm earlier results that large trades, which qualify as shocks {{for the purpose of this}} analysis, are timed as they occur when liquidity in the market is extraordinarily high. Moreover, we find that adverse liquidity effects peak within the first-minute interval after a large trade. In contrast to previous researchers’ results, we discover that liquidity recovers not within minutes, but within a few seconds so that the adverse effect already diminishes significantly towards the end of the first post-event minute. Three minutes later, basically no residue from the liquidity shock remains observable. We attribute this finding to the fact that temporary order-book imbalances are immediately detected by algorithmic trading engines and high-frequency traders whose order management (IT-) systems are continuously eagleeying the stock markets for such opportunities. Interestingly, our results differ depending on the market under scrutiny...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the strong sales dip {{observed}} in the manufacturing industry {{at the end of}} 2008, following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the subsequent collapse of the financial world. We suggest that firms¿ desire to retain liquidity during these times prompted a reaction characterized by the reduction of working capital, which materialized as a synchronized reduction in target inventory levels across industries. We hypothesize that such a reaction effectively acted as an <b>endogenous</b> <b>shock</b> to supply chains, ultimately resulting in the bullwhip-effect kind of demand dynamics observed. To test this proposition we develop a system dynamics model that explicitly takes into account structural, operational, and behavioral parameters of supply chains aggregated at an echelon level. We calibrate the model for use in 4 different business units of a major chemical company in the Netherlands, all situated 4 – 5 levels upstream from consumer demands in their respective supply chains. We show that the model gives a very good historical fit of the sales developments during the period following the Lehman collapse. We test the model¿s robustness to behavioral parameter estimation errors through sensitivity analysis, and the de-stocking hypothesis against an alternative model. Finally, we observe that the empirical data is aligned with experimental observations regarding human behavioral mechanisms concerning target adjustment times...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{contributing to}} multiorgan dysfunction during cardiogenic shock are poorly understood. Our {{goal was to}} characterize the microcirculatory and mitochondrial responses following ≥ 10 hours of severe left ventricular failure and cardiogenic shock. We employed a closed-chest porcine model of cardiogenic shock induced by left coronary microembolization (n = 12) and a time-matched control group (n = 6). Hemodynamics and metabolism were measured hourly by intravascular pressure catheters, thermodilution, arterial and organ specific blood gases. Echocardiography and assessment of the sublingual microcirculation by sidestream darkfield imaging were performed at baseline, 2 ± 1 and 13 ± 3 (mean ± SD) hours after coronary microembolization. Upon hemodynamic decompensation, cardiac, renal and hepatic mitochondria were isolated and evaluated by high-resolution respirometry. Low cardiac output, hypotension, oliguria and severe reductions in mixed-venous and hepatic O 2 saturations were evident in cardiogenic shock. The sublingual total and perfused vessel densities were fully preserved throughout the experiments. Cardiac mitochondrial respiration was unaltered, whereas state 2, 3 and 4 respiration of renal and hepatic mitochondria were increased in cardiogenic shock. Mitochondrial viability (RCR; state 3 /state 4) and efficiency (ADP/O ratio) were unaffected. Our study demonstrates that the microcirculation is preserved in a porcine model of untreated cardiogenic shock despite vital organ hypoperfusion. Renal and hepatic mitochondrial respiration is upregulated, possibly through demand-related adaptations, and the <b>endogenous</b> <b>shock</b> response is thus compensatory and protective, even after several hours of global hypoperfusion...|$|E

It expands traditional vector autoregressive model to a multi-country model that relates bank real lending, the cyclical component of output and spreads and accounts for cross-sectional dependence across the countries. Impulse response functions show that exogenous positive shock lead to a drop in output sustainability for nine over twelve Central Eastern European countries, when the <b>endogenous</b> <b>shock</b> is mild and ambiguous. Moreover {{the effect of the}} exogenous shock is more significant in the aftermath the crises. The second essay investigates variation in entrepreneurial activity, as proxied by the rate of self-employment, across 374 European cities during the period of 1989 - 2010. While controlling for various spillover effects across cities we find that the rate of self-employment is largely explained by the level of education, urbanisation economies, institutional environment and industrial structure of a city. Self-employment rates are higher in agriculture and fishing industry; trade, hotels and restaurants industry; meanwhile mining, manufacturing and energy sector with higher positive effect of scale abandon self-employment. At the same time a U-shaped relationship per resident income determines existence of both necessity driven and genuine self-employment. The third essay explains variation in entrepreneurship across cities of Commonwealth of Independent States during 1995 - 2008, utilizing a unique database and employing dynamic panel data analysis. The findings suggest that banking reform facilitates entrepreneurship, whereas the size of the state discourages it. A U-shaped relationship between per capita income and entrepreneurship is confirmed. It‘s established that a city with a higher concentration of universities is likely to have higher entrepreneurial entry that provides some evidence for the importance of agglomeration economies in terms of knowledge concentration which leads to intensified exchange of ideas and drive knowledge-based entrepreneurship.

40|$|Cities {{throughout}} the world currently are exploring ways that arts and culture can serve as an economic engine, build name recognition and {{become a source of}} civic pride through a mix of policy, branding, and economic development. I examine the relationship between cultural policy and the increased presence of arts and culture on the economic development agenda in Toronto and New York during the decade of the 2000 s. I hypothesize that New York is more driven by economic motivations, and that Toronto’s interest lies in the brand building aspect of arts and culture in city building. This dissertation is a comparative case study that investigates the increased presence of arts and culture in the economic development toolkits of Toronto and New York over the decade. Archival and historical data, in addition to interviews with elite actors provide a rich cache with which to answer the thesis question. Through the use of agenda setting theory, I find ways that arts and culture have been integrated into policymaking and urban planning for economic development in each city. I observe that Toronto and New York are building and facilitating cultural districts, attracting and retaining creative workers, and articulating economic arguments for arts and culture in order to generate revenues and secure government and private support. Each city underwent a shock during {{the early part of the}} decade. For Toronto, it was the <b>endogenous</b> <b>shock</b> of amalgamation, and for New York the exogenous shock of 9 / 11. In both cities, arts and culture were employed as a part of the economic development toolkit to revitalize decaying areas, attract residents and tourists, and distinguish themselves from other cities. I find that each urban center used arts and culture extensively to create a cultural city in the case of Toronto, and to recreate a cultural city in the case of New York. Policy recommendations include utilizing research and strategic planning, building relationships and stakeholder partnerships across policy domains and sectors, and focusing both on public good and economic benefit when integrating arts and culture into economic development intervention...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. Over {{the past}} decade and a half Austria {{experienced}} no less than two exogenous shocks and one <b>endogenous</b> <b>shock,</b> each of which was capable of throwing into turmoil the country’s political and economic system as it had existed since the end of World War II. The collapse of the Iron Curtain, Austria’s integration into the Single European Market, and the rapid rise of the radical populist right threatened the existing socio-economic and political fabric precisely because the country had always been regarded as a model of ultra-stability. Yet, unlike, for example, the Italian Partitocrazia, where the end of the Cold War triggered a complete collapse of the ancien regime, Austria’s political arrangements survived into the late 1990 s. Even thereafter, the system managed to adapt, preserving several of its key elements. Unlike fellow corporatist Sweden, whose economy and economic system underwent a major crisis in the 1990 s, Austria emerged from the difficult process of internationalization without a similar disruption. Instead, change came gradually and largely in an organized fashion. Moreover, unlike Germany, Austria’s large northern neighbor, most important trading partner, and erstwhile role model, the Alpine nation continually managed to combine low unemployment with a reasonably solid economic performance. Since 1999, Austria surpassed (West) Germany in terms of per capita economic output, while maintaining unemployment at rates lower than most OECD countries. Although the jobless rate never exceeded 4. 5 % (even in the recent recession), the Austrian government managed to presented a balanced budget by 2001; a goal which had seemed unattainable just a few years earlier. Moreover, compared with Germany, Austria boosts a higher per capita purchasing power (€ 17, 699 vs. 17, 087), lower corporate taxes (25 % vs. 39 %), longer working hours (1750 vs. 1786), and a better earnings-to-productivity ratio (1 : 1. 8 vs 1 : 1. 2). In fact, when adjusted for purchasing power parity, Austria, along with Luxembourg, Denmark, Ireland, the Netherlands, is now among the richest member states of the European Union, surpassing even such successful economies as Sweden, Finland, and Belgium. A cross-national study released in 2005, which compared 1207 regions in 25 EU countries, found that five of the top 20 areas were located in Austria. Overall, the Alpine Republic took the second rank after only Ireland. Yet, Austria’s relative success at adapting itself to new political and economic realities was neither a foregone conclusion nor free from severe problems and moments of crisis. Only five years ago, Austria found itself under political sanctions by its 14 EU partners and faced an uncertain political future. This paper is an attempt to provide an overview of Austria’s coping mechanisms and seeks to explain their considerable success. Furthermore, the article also argues that the simultaneity of three major challenges - integration, the end of the Cold War, {{and the rise of the}} radical right - each served to stabilize certain components of the Austrian model at a critical juncture, while other elements were undergoing a necessary transformation. In many ways, the different shocks not only induced change but also served to mutually reinforce the Austrian system enough to allow for both a gradual and sequential adaptation...|$|E

40|$|In recent years, {{the world}} has {{witnessed}} the emergence of violent extremists (VEs), and they have become an ongoing concern for countries around the globe. A great deal of effort has been expended examining their nature and structure in order {{to aid in the}} development of interventions to prevent further violence. Analysts and scholars have been particularly interested in identifying structural features that enhance (or diminish) VE resilience to exogenous and <b>endogenous</b> <b>shocks.</b> As many have noted, VEs typically seek to balance operational security and capacity/efficiency. Some argue that their desire for secrecy outweighs their desire for efficiency, which leads them to be less centralized with few internal connections. Others argue that centralization is necessary because security is more easily compromised and that internal density promotes solidarity and limits countervailing influences. Unsurprisingly, scholars have found evidence for both positions. In this paper, we analyze the Noordin Top terrorist network over time to examine the security-efficiency tradeoff from a new perspective. We find that the process by which they adopt various network structures is far more complex than much of the current literature suggests.

40|$|The Paper {{approaches}} business cycles {{in terms}} of extrinsic uncertainty related, not to dynamic indeterminacy of intertemporal equilibria (in the neighborhood of an attractor) or to multiplicity of steady states (in non-linear models), but to static indeterminacy of free entry oligopolistic equilibria within each period. We consider an OLG economy in which firms, supplying differentiated goods within each one of many sectors, and producing under increasing returns-to-scale, compete in prices in perfectly contestable markets. The number of active firms is shown to vary across sectoral equilibria, depending upon the (correct) producers’ conjectures on the actions of their competitors. These conjectures {{are assumed to be}} coordinated by some extrinsic Markov chain, thus generating <b>endogenous</b> <b>shocks</b> in both the markup factor and productivity, and resulting in perturbations of the dynamic system (as in the case of exogenous random shocks). Consumers’ expectations may magnify the extrinsic uncertainty characterizing producers’ conjectures. Since the source of fluctuations does not rely on dynamic indeterminacy, we can weaken the condition on the degree of increasing returns, which may be arbitrarily small (with a moderate positive elasticity of labour supply), provided goods substitutability within each sector becomes arbitrarily large. animal spirits; business cycles; free entry; indeterminacy; oligopoly; sunspots...|$|R

40|$|Iran is an oil {{exporting}} country in Middle East. The high {{share of the}} oil revenues in Iran is a serious economic problem. Due to the high dependency of Iran’s economy on oil revenues, oil price shocks have a determinant impact on macroeconomic variables. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic effects of oil price shocks and the aggregate supply and aggregate demand shocks on macroeconomic fluctuations in Iran. According to macroeconomic theory and aggregate demand and supply model in equilibrium, a structural vector autoregressive (VAR) model is applied to identify different structural shocks and further assess the relative contributions of different shocks on macroeconomic fluctuations, using a decomposition approach. The results show that oil price shocks have significant and positive effects on both output and inflation. Aggregate supply and aggregate demand shocks are the main causes of fluctuation in output and inflation, and moreover, the effect of aggregate supply shocks on output is permanent in the Iranian economy. On the base of this study results, we suggest the Iranian government should accelerate the economic reforms such as the finance system of state owned enterprises, the tax system, the cash subsidy distribution system, the allocation system of the government budget in national and provincial level, the financial and banking system, and so on.

40|$|In practice, {{central banks}} have been {{confronted with a}} {{trade-off}} between stabilising inflation and output when dealing with rising oil prices. This contrasts with the result in the standard New Keynesian model that ensuring complete price stability is the optimal thing to do, even when an oil shock leads to large output drops. To reconcile this apparent contradiction, this paper investigates how monetary policy should react to oil shocks in a microfounded model with staggered price-setting and with oil as an input in a CES production function. In particular, we extend Benigno and Woodford (2005) to obtain a second order approximation to the expected utility of the representative household when the steady state is distorted {{and the economy is}} hit by oil price shocks. The main result is that oil price <b>shocks</b> generate an <b>endogenous</b> trade-off between inflation and output stabilisation when oil has low substitutability in production. Therefore, it becomes optimal for the monetary authority to stabilise partially the effects of oil shocks on inflation and some inflation is desirable. We also find, in contrast to Benigno and Woodford (2005), that this trade-off is reduced, but not eliminated, when we get rid of the effects of monopolistic distortions in the steady state. Moreover, the size of the <b>endogenous</b> "cost-push" <b>shock</b> generated by fluctuations in the oil price increases when oil is more difficult to substitute by other factors. optimal monetary policy, welfare, second order solution, oil price <b>shocks,</b> <b>endogenous</b> trade-off...|$|R

When products go out of patent protection, the rush of entry into their production destroys incentives for process improvements. Consequently, old production processes are enshrined in industries producing non-protected products, resulting in aggregate productivity persistence. Our model also generates sizeable delayed movements in productivity in response to preference shocks, providing a form of <b>endogenous</b> news <b>shock.</b> Finally, if we calibrate our model to match a high aggregate mark-up then we can replicate the negative response of hours to a positive technology shock, even without the inclusion of any frictions...|$|R

Another new strand of the literature explains productivity and economic growth differentials by gaps in general purpose technology and information and communication technology, while another literature cites real exchange rate depreciations as the main explanatory variable. These gaps might explain differences in economic performances between developed and developing countries, but they {{are too small to}} explain differences between developed industrial economies such as New Zealand and Australia or Canada and the United States. In this paper, more than eighty percent of labour productivity gaps between New Zealand and Australia and Canada and the United States are explained by <b>endogenous</b> technology <b>shocks</b> (TFP) and capital intensities. Productivity, nontradable prices, real exchange rate...|$|R

Using different model specifications and methodological approaches, I identify a positive causal relationship between a firm’s public attention and the investor base as well as liquidity of its stocks. Firms covered more frequently by the mass media have {{a larger number of}} shareholders, and higher stock liquidity. In addition, I find that {{the effect of}} attention on stock liquidity is larger in small firms than in large ones. As firm size increases, the improvement in liquidity caused by additional media coverage declines. My findings are robust to different liquidity measures, and industry- and time-fixed effects. Moreover, the non-linearity problem, the reverse causality problem, the firm fixed effect, and <b>endogenous</b> event <b>shocks</b> do not appear to drive my results...|$|R
