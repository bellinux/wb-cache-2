5|$|After leaving Cornell (the first time), Warner became {{head coach}} of the {{football}} team at Carlisle Indian Industrial School in 1899, a flagship Indian boarding school founded to teach children and young men skills to advance <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>society.</b> Its late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century football teams were nationally prominent, and Warner was paid $1,200 (approximately $33,000 in 2016), an exceptionally high salary for a coach at the time.|$|E
5|$|Broader {{tensions}} <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>society</b> {{surfaced in}} Yosemite {{when a large}} number of youths gathered in the park over the summer of 1970, triggering a riot on July4 after rangers tried to evict visitors from camping illegally in Stoneman Meadow. Rioters attacked the rangers with rocks, and pulled mounted rangers from their horses. The National Guard was brought in to restore order.|$|E
5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press. It {{is the product of}} his late 1970s 18-month ethnographic study of a 350-person Christian fundamentalist Baptist school in Illinois. He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>society</b> for promoting intolerance towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E

5|$|On April 4, King—a {{prominent}} African-American {{civil rights}} leader—was assassinated. Race riots subsequently broke {{out across the}} United States. After delivering an improvised speech on the matter in Indianapolis, Kennedy withdrew to the hotel he was staying in and suspended his presidential campaign. Community leaders convinced him to keep a single engagement before the City Club of Cleveland. Doing away with his prepared remarks, Kennedy's speechwriters worked early into the morning of April 5 creating a full response to the assassination. Kennedy reviewed and revised the draft during his flight to Cleveland. Speaking in a tragic mode for only ten minutes before 2,200 people, Kennedy outlined his view on violence <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>society.</b> He criticized both the rioters and the white establishment who, from his perspective, {{were responsible for the}} deterioration of social conditions in the United States. He proposed no specific solutions to the internal division and conflict, but admonished the audience to seek common ground and try to cooperate with other Americans.|$|E
5|$|The {{research}} findings of historian Carroll Quigley, {{author of the}} 1966 book Tragedy and Hope, are taken by both conspiracy theorists of the American Old Right (W. Cleon Skousen) and New Left (Carl Oglesby) to substantiate this view, even though Quigley argued that the Establishment {{is not involved in}} a plot to implement a one-world government but rather British and American benevolent imperialism driven by the mutual interests of economic elites in the United Kingdom and the United States. Quigley also argued that, although the Round Table still exists today, its position in influencing the policies of world leaders has been much reduced from its heyday during World War I and slowly waned after the end of World War II and the Suez Crisis. Today the Round Table is largely a ginger group, designed to consider and gradually influence the policies of the Commonwealth of Nations, but faces strong opposition. Furthermore, <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>society</b> after 1965, the problem, according to Quigley, was that no elite was in charge and acting responsibly.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1960s, as {{attitudes toward}} women's role <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>society</b> changed, Lois' {{character}} changed as well. In Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane issue #80 (Jan. 1968), the character's fashions were updated to a then more contemporary look. Stories in the 1970s depicted Lois as fully capable and less reliant on Superman. She engaged in more adventures without Superman being involved and was much less interested in discovering Superman's secret identity.|$|E

25|$|During Crises, great peril provokes a {{societal}} consensus, {{an ethic of}} personal sacrifice, and strong institutional order. During Awakenings, an ethic of individualism emerges, and the institutional order is attacked by new social ideals and spiritual agendas. According to the authors, about every eighty to ninety years—the length of a long human life—a national Crisis occurs <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>society.</b> Roughly halfway to the next Crisis, a cultural Awakening occurs (historically, these have often been called Great Awakenings).|$|E
25|$|Steven Sheehan {{explains}} {{the popularity of}} The Honeymooners {{as the embodiment of}} working-class masculinity in the character of Ralph Kramden, and postwar ideals <b>in</b> <b>American</b> <b>society</b> regarding work, housing, consumerism, and consumer satisfaction.
