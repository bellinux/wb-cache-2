It is the patriarchal desire <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> that blurs the distinction between Western modernity and Doro’s project.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> the Hungarians {{right wing}} was {{attacked}} by the Herzinger brigade from Cseke, which swept away the Hungarian Dipold brigade, and pushed {{it back to the}} forest from Hölvény (outside of Nagysalló). But here the Bobich brigade stopped them, while the retreating Hungarian brigade also stopped and regrouped. Here these two brigades were taken over by Major General Richard Guyon (who was not supposed to participate in the battle, because he was designate as the new commander of the besieged troops of Komárom, just wanted to fight, and help his army to obtain the victory). The two Hungarian brigades under the lead of Guyon forced the Herzinger brigade to retreat.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> Simunich {{was about}} to suffer a heavy defeat, but he was saved by the {{intervention}} of the II. and III. corps of the imperial army, which retreated from Buda and Pest, as Welden had ordered five days before, after the battle of Nagysalló. The overall lead of the imperial army was taken by Schlik, the commander of the III. corps, ordering at noon a general attack against the Hungarians. Until that moment the Hungarian and the imperial troops had equal numbers (around 14 000 Hungarian troops from the I. and the III. corps against equal numbers of Simunich's besieging army), but the involvement of the III. imperial corps led by Franz Schlik, created a 2-1 Austrian superiority.|$|E

25|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the 4th Sándor Hussar Regiment led by Poeltenberg, {{together with the}} cavalry of the III. corps, led by General József Nagysándor, with a cavalry battalion, appeared on the right flank of the imperials. Their attack obliterated the imperial cavalry. The Austrians retreated to Nagymálas, being pursued by the Hungarian army. Here the cavalry attacked again, while {{a part of the}} infantry with a battery encircled the village from left, and two half batteries advanced on the road. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> from the woods of Nagymálas charged out an imperial battalion, but the fire of the Hungarian artillery disintegrated them, and drove them in the village. But because the imperial troops gathered in Nagymálas were bombarded from the front and sides, they retreated from the village, and took position behind it.|$|E
25|$|His term as rector was brief, though, for on June 9, 1982, he was {{appointed}} coadjutor bishop to the then controversial and prophetic Bishop Francisco Claver, of Diocese of Malaybalay, Bukidnon. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> of difficulty, Rosales recalled that a stampita (holy picture) dropped from his breviary (liturgy of the hours). It was from Mother (now Blessed) Teresa of Calcutta. When he picked it up, he saw the writing at the back. It read: “Allow God to use you without first consulting you.” These words brought peace to his soul. On September 14, 1984, Rosales succeeded the Bishop of Malaybalay taking complete authority over the diocese. He started his ministry in Malaybalay by forming with his people, especially the priest and religious there, {{a vision of the}} diocese: that of the total development of every person and all persons, brought about by Jesus Christ. In that difficult assignment, he was able to bring about the unity of the clergy as they struggled especially for justice, peace and environmental protection. He often looks back to his days there as the golden moments of his ministry.|$|E
25|$|Until 3 o'clock {{the battle}} {{continued}} mostly with cannonade. Gáspár was waiting that his two cavalry squadrons sent to Ecséd, and the brigade sent to Csány to arrive, before {{he planned to}} start the attack. In the meanwhile Schlik was incapable to advance. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>moment</b> the detached troops arrived and Gáspár gave the order to attack. He sent three brigades from the division of Poeltenberg to encircle {{the wings of the}} enemy. The cavalry squadron and the two cannons led by lieutenant-colonel Lajos Zámbelly moved around the left wing, while the Liptay-brigade advanced on the right wing. In this time Gáspár did not moved, because he waited for his troops to encircle the enemy. But Schlik felt that something dangerous is happening, and ordered his troops to retreat on the vineyard hills between Hort and Hatvan. The Poeltenberg division advanced, and with the troops commanded by Zámbélly and Liptay, from three sides they started a concentric attack against Hatvan. Schlik, after positioning some of his infantry and artillery on the heights in front of the bridge on the Zagyva river, ordered to his sappers to make another bridge to enable him to retreat hist troops, cannons and baggage from Hatvan as fast as possible. In the meanwhile general Damjanich sent from the III. corps the division led by Józef Wysocki, whose approach was observed by Schlik, and the Austrian retreat became more panic-stricken. In the end the imperial infantry which defended the Zagyva bridges, and the crossing to the other bank of the imperial troops, succeeded in breaking down the both bridges on the river, thus preventing the Hungarians to catch them up and encircle them. Schlik's cavalry retreated between Bag and Hatvan, while his infantry and artillery to Aszód, than to Gödöllő.|$|E
