5|$|The {{principles}} of {{gas metal arc}} welding began to be understood in the early 19th century, after Humphry Davy discovered the short pulsed electric arcs in 1800. Vasily Petrov independently produced the continuous electric arc in 1802 (followed by Davy after 1808). It was not until the 1880s that the technology became developed with the aim of industrial usage. At first, carbon electrodes were used in carbon arc welding. By 1890, metal electrodes had been <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> Nikolay Slavyanov and C. L. Coffin. In 1920, an early predecessor of GMAW was <b>invented</b> <b>by</b> P. O. Nobel of General Electric. It used a bare electrode wire and direct current, and used arc voltage to regulate the feed rate. It did not use a shielding gas to protect the weld, as developments in welding atmospheres did not take place until later that decade. In 1926 another forerunner of GMAW was released, but it was not suitable for practical use.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} this rule is to avoid {{applicants}} speculatively filing for patents for inventions {{that they have not}} yet invented in order to get priority over competitors. Without this requirement, an applicant might delay scientific and technical progress by blocking competitors from inventing something that the applicant has not yet invented. The written description requirement thus reinforces the idea that patents are a reward for <b>inventing</b> <b>by</b> requiring the applicant to show she possesses the invention.|$|R

5|$|These {{molecules}} are rod-shaped, some {{created in}} the lab and some appearing spontaneously in nature. Since then, two new types of LC molecules have been discovered, both man-made: disc-shaped (created by S.

5|$|These sights {{are also}} used on astronomical {{telescope}}s as finderscopes, to help aim the telescope at the desired object.

Others are now available from companies such as Apogee, Celestron, Photon, Rigel, and Televue.|$|E
