40|$|Scientists and {{engineers}} {{work with the}} reduction, analysis, and manipulation of data. In many instances, the recorded data must meet certain requirements before standard numerical techniques {{may be used to}} interpret it. For example, the analysis of a linear visoelastic material requires knowledge of one of two time-dependent properties, the stress relaxation modulus E(t) or the creep compliance D(t), one of which may be derived from the other by a numerical method if the recorded data points are evenly spaced or increasingly spaced with respect to the time coordinate. The problem is that most laboratory data are variably spaced, making the use of numerical techniques difficult. To ease this difficulty in the case of stress relaxation data analysis, NASA scientists developed DATASPACE (A Program for the Logarithmic Interpolation of Test Data), to establish a logarithmically increasing time interval in the relaxation data. The program is generally applicable to any situation in which a data set needs increasingly spaced abscissa values. DATASPACE first takes the logarithm of the abscissa values, then uses a cubic spline interpolation routine (which minimizes interpolation error) to create an evenly spaced array from the log values. This array is returned from the log abscissa domain to the abscissa domain and written to an output file for further manipulation. As a result of the interpolation in the log abscissa domain, the data is increasingly spaced. In the case of stress relaxation data, the array is closely spaced at short times and widely spaced at long times, thus avoiding the distortion inherent in evenly spaced time coordinates. The interpolation routine gives results which compare favorably with the recorded data. The experimental data curve is retained and the interpolated points reflect the desired spacing. DATASPACE is written in FORTRAN 77 for IBM PC compatibles with a math co-processor running MS-DOS and Apple Macintosh computers running MacOS. With minor modifications the source code is portable to any platform that supports an ANSI FORTRAN 77 compiler. MicroSoft FORTRAN v 2. 1 is required for the Macintosh version. An executable is included with the PC version.

40|$|The Lagrange {{multiplier}} {{method has}} been used for many years by engineers to develop equations of motion in multibody problems. Use of the Lagrange multiplier has an advantage over some other formulations in that it preserves the original simple form of the equations of motion for each body. However, in typical time-varying dynamics simulations that use the Lagrange multiplier, computational instability can occur because integration error causes the two (or more) attached bodies to drift apart and violate the constraints. The computational instability usually happens suddenly, and the computed values "blow up" within a few time steps. TWOBODY utilizes a new programming technique which eliminates computational instability in multibody simulations that use the Lagrange multiplier. This new technique uses the constraint equations, instead of integration, to determine the coordinates that are not independent. TWOBODY employs a simple model, consisting of a solid rocket booster and a parachute connected by a frictionless swivel, to illustrate the new technique. TWOBODY is written in FORTRAN 77 for IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS. It requires 100 K of RAM for execution. A sample executable is included with the distribution media.

40|$|The {{frequency}} {{and intensity of}} rain attenuation affecting the communication between a satellite and an earth terminal is an important consideration in planning satellite links. The NASA Lewis Research Center Satellite Link Attenuation Model Program (LeRC-SLAM) provides a static and dynamic statistical assessment {{of the impact of}} rain attenuation on a communications link established between an earth terminal and a geosynchronous satellite. The program is designed for use in the specification, design and assessment of satellite links for any terminal location in the continental United States. The basis for LeRC-SLAM is the ACTS Rain Attenuation Prediction Model, which uses a log-normal cumulative probability distribution to describe the random process of rain attenuation on satellite links. The derivation of the statistics for the rainrate process at the specified terminal location relies on long term rainfall records compiled by the U. S. Weather Service during time periods of up to 55 years in length. The theory of extreme value statistics is also utilized. The user provides 1) the longitudinal position of the satellite in geosynchronous orbit, 2) the geographical position of the earth terminal in terms of latitude and longitude, 3) the height above sea level of the terminal site, 4) the yearly average rainfall at the terminal site, and 5) the operating frequency of the communications link (within 1 to 1000 GHz, inclusive). Based on the yearly average rainfall at the terminal location, LeRC-SLAM calculates the relevant rain statistics for the site using an internal data base. The program then generates rain attenuation data for the satellite link. This data includes a description of the static (i. e., yearly) attenuation process, an evaluation of the cumulative probability distribution for attenuation effects, and an evaluation of the probability of fades below selected fade depths. In addition, LeRC-SLAM calculates the elevation and azimuth angles of the terminal antenna required to establish a link with the satellite, the statistical parameters that characterize the rainrate process at the terminal site, the length of the propagation path within the potential rain region, and its projected length onto the local horizontal. The IBM PC version of LeRC-SLAM (LEW- 14979) is written in Microsoft QuickBASIC for an IBM PC compatible computer with a monitor and printer capable of supporting an 80 -column format. The IBM PC version is available on a 5. 25 inch MS-DOS <b>format</b> <b>diskette.</b> The program requires about 30 K RAM. The source code and executable are included.

40|$|The PYROLASER {{package is}} an {{operating}} {{system for the}} Pyrometer Instrument Company's Pyrolaser. There are 6 individual programs in the PYROLASER package: two main programs, two lower level subprograms, and two programs which, although independent, function predominantly as macros. The package provides a quick and easy way to setup, control, and program a standard Pyrolaser. Temperature and emissivity measurements may be either collected as if the Pyrolaser were in the manual operations mode, or displayed on real time strip charts and stored in standard spreadsheet format for post-test analysis. A shell is supplied to allow macros, which are test-specific, to be easily added to the system. The Pyrolaser Simple Operation program provides full on-screen remote operation capabilities, thus allowing the user to operate the Pyrolaser from the computer just {{as it would be}} operated manually. The Pyrolaser Simple Operation program also allows the use of "quick starts". Quick starts provide an easy way to permit routines to be used as setup macros for specific applications or tests. The specific procedures required for a test may be ordered in a sequence structure and then the sequence structure can be started with a simple button in the cluster structure provided. One quick start macro is provided for continuous Pyrolaser operation. A subprogram, Display Continuous Pyr Data, is used to display and store the resulting data output. Using this macro, the system is set up for continuous operation and the subprogram is called to display the data in real time on strip charts. The data is simultaneously stored in a spreadsheet format. The resulting spreadsheet file can be opened in any {{one of a number of}} commercially available spreadsheet programs. The Read Continuous Pyrometer program is provided as a continuously run subprogram for incorporation of the Pyrolaser software into a process control or feedback control scheme in a multi-component system. The program requires the Pyrolaser to be set up using the Pyrometer String Transfer macro. It requires no inputs and provides temperature and emissivity as outputs. The Read Continuous Pyrometer program can be run continuously and the data can be sampled as often or as seldom as updates of temperature and emissivity are required. PYROLASER is written using the Labview software for use on Macintosh series computers running System 6. 0. 3 or later, Sun Sparc series computers running OpenWindows 3. 0 or MIT's X Window System (X 11 R 4 or X 11 R 5), and IBM PC or compatibles running Microsoft Windows 3. 1 or later.

40|$|One area of {{research}} of the Information Sciences Division at NASA Ames Research Center {{is devoted to the}} analysis and enhancement of processors and advanced computer architectures, specifically in support of automation and robotic systems. To compare systems' abilities to efficiently process Lisp and Ada, scientists at Ames Research Center have developed a suite of non-parallel benchmarks called ELAPSE. The benchmark suite was designed to test a single computer's efficiency as well as alternate machine comparisons on Lisp, and/or Ada languages. ELAPSE tests the efficiency with which a machine can execute the various routines in each environment. The sample routines are based on numeric and symbolic manipulations and include two-dimensional fast Fourier transformations, Cholesky decomposition and substitution, Gaussian elimination, high-level data processing, and symbol-list references. Also included is a routine based on a Bayesian classification program sorting data into optimized groups. The ELAPSE benchmarks are available for any computer with a validated Ada compiler and/or Common Lisp system. Of the 18 routines that comprise ELAPSE, provided within this package are 14 developed or translated at Ames. The others are readily available through literature. The benchmark that requires the most memory is CHOLESKY. ADA. Under VAX/VMS, CHOLESKY. ADA requires 760 K of main memory.

It will read image files in JPL's two primary image formats- VICAR and PDS - {{as well as}} the Macintosh PICT format. VICAR (NPO- 18076) handles an array of image processing capabilities which may be used for a variety of applications including biomedical image processing, cartography, earth resources, and geological exploration. Pixel Pusher can also import VICAR format color lookup tables for viewing images in pseudocolor (256 colors). This program currently supports only eight bit images but will work on monitors with any number of colors. Arbitrarily large image files may be viewed in a normal Macintosh window. Color and contrast enhancement can be performed with a graphical "stretch" editor (as in contrast stretch). In addition, VICAR images may be saved as Macintosh PICT files for exporting into other Macintosh programs, and individual pixels can be queried to determine their locations and actual data values. Pixel Pusher is written in Symantec's Think C and was developed for use on a Macintosh SE 30, LC, or II series computer running System Software 6. 0. 3 or later and 32 bit QuickDraw.

It allows mixed gas J-T analysis for any fluid combination of neon, nitrogen, various hydrocarbons, argon, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide. When {{used in conjunction with}} the NIST computer program DDMIX, JTMIX has accurately predicted order-of-magnitude increases in J-T cooling capacities when various hydrocarbons are added to nitrogen, and it predicts nitrogen normal boiling point depressions to as low as 60 K when neon is added. JTMIX searches for heat exchanger "pinch points" that can result from insolubility of various components in each other. These points result in numerical solutions that cannot exist. The length of the heat exchanger is searched for such points and, if they exist, the user is warned and the temperatures and heat exchanger effectiveness are corrected to provide a real solution. JTMIX gives very good correlation (within data accuracy) to mixed gas data published by the USSR and data taken by APD for the U. S. Naval Weapons Lab. Data taken at JPL also confirms JTMIX for all cases tested. JTMIX is written in Turbo C for IBM PC compatible computers running MS-DOS.

40|$|Accurate {{simulation}} of nuclear thermal propulsion systems using computational methods will permit reductions in testing and, thus, {{the time and}} cost of achieving a flight ready status for systems utilizing this advanced technology. An accurate simulation must maintain a "balance-of-plant" where the required pump work equals the supplied turbine work. This turbopump assembly balancing must {{be integrated into the}} overall system analysis models. TPA was developed to balance turbine and pump work using performance maps. It requires the inlet properties, performance maps, and shaft speed. TPA then computes the exit conditions and work terms. The work terms can then be balanced by varying the input shaft speed. The objective of the pump analysis is to determine the propellant state properties at the pump exit and the pump work. The pump analysis algorithm for liquid flow assumes that the shaft speed, the propellant state properties at the pump entrance, the propellant flow rate, the pump entrance and exit areas, as well as performance curves, are all known. The analysis of both the pump pressure rise and pump efficiency curves is required. The objective of the turbine analysis is to determine the propellant state properties at the turbine exit and the turbine work. The turbine analysis algorithm assumes that the shaft speed, the propellant state properties at the turbine entrance, the propellant flow rate, the turbine root mean square blade diameter, the turbine entrance and exit areas, as well as performance curves, are all known. The analysis also requires the turbine flow parameter curve and the turbine total efficiency curve. TPA is written in FORTRAN 77 to be machine independent. The TPA package includes the NBS+_PH 2 code, which is also available separately (LEW- 15505). TPA has been successfully implemented on a DEC VAX series computer running VMS, a Sun 4 series computer running SunOS, and an IBM PC compatible computer running MS-DOS.

40|$|WT was {{developed}} to calculate fan rotor power requirements and output thrust for a closed loop wind tunnel. The program uses blade element theory to calculate aerodynamic forces along the blade using airfoil lift and drag characteristics at an appropriate blade aspect ratio. A tip loss model is also used which reduces the lift coefficient to zero for the outer three percent of the blade radius. The application of momentum theory is not {{used to determine the}} axial velocity at the rotor plane. Unlike a propeller, the wind tunnel rotor is prevented from producing an increase in velocity in the slipstream. Instead, velocities at the rotor plane are used as input. Other input for WT includes rotational speed, rotor geometry, and airfoil characteristics. Inputs for rotor blade geometry include blade radius, hub radius, number of blades, and pitch angle. Airfoil aerodynamic inputs include angle at zero lift coefficient, positive stall angle, drag coefficient at zero lift coefficient, and drag coefficient at stall. WT is written in APL 2 using IBM's APL 2 interpreter for IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS. WT requires a CGA or better color monitor for display. It also requires 640 K of RAM and MS-DOS v 3. 1 or later for execution. Both an MS-DOS executable and the source code are provided on the distribution medium.

40|$|PWC is {{used for}} {{pair-wise}} comparisons in both psychometric scaling techniques and cognitive research. The cognitive tasks and processes of a human operator of automated systems are now prominent considerations when defining system requirements. Recent developments in cognitive research have emphasized the potential utility of psychometric scaling techniques, such as multidimensional scaling, for representing human knowledge and cognitive processing structures. Such techniques involve collecting measurements of stimulus-relatedness from human observers. When data are analyzed using this scaling approach, an n-dimensional representation of the stimuli is produced. This resulting representation is said to describe the subject's cognitive or perceptual view of the stimuli. PWC applies {{one of the many}} techniques commonly used to acquire the data necessary for these types of analyses: pair-wise comparisons. PWC administers the task, collects the data from the test subject, and formats the data for analysis. It therefore addresses many of the limitations of the traditional "pen-and-paper" methods. By automating the data collection process, subjects are prevented from going back to check previous responses, the possibility of erroneous data transfer is eliminated, and the burden of the administration and taking of the test is eased. By using randomization, PWC ensures that subjects see the stimuli pairs presented in random order, and that each subject sees pairs in a different random order. PWC is written in Turbo Pascal v 6. 0 for IBM PC compatible computers running MS-DOS. The program has also been successfully compiled with Turbo Pascal v 7. 0. A sample executable is provided. PWC requires 30 K of RAM for execution.

40|$|Flexibility in {{choosing}} how to display computer-generated three-dimensional drawings {{has become increasingly}} important in recent years. A major consideration is the enhancement of the realism and aesthetics of the presentation. A polygonal representation of objects, even with hidden lines removed, is not always desirable. A more pleasing pictorial representation often {{can be achieved by}} removing some of the remaining visible lines, thus creating silhouettes (or outlines) of selected surfaces of the object. Additionally, {{it should be noted that}} this silhouette feature allows warped polygons. This means that any polygon can be decomposed into constituent triangles. Considering these triangles as members of the same family will present a polygon with no interior lines, and thus removes the restriction of flat polygons. SILHOUETTE is a program for calligraphic drawings that can render any subset of polygons as a silhouette with respect to itself. The program is flexible enough to be applicable to every class of object. SILHOUETTE offers all possible combinations of silhouette and nonsilhouette specifications for an arbitrary solid. Thus, it is possible to enhance the clarity of any three-dimensional scene presented in two dimensions. Input to the program can be line segments or polygons. Polygons designated with the same number will be drawn as a silhouette of those polygons. SILHOUETTE is written in FORTRAN 77 and requires a graphics package such as DI- 3000. The program has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer running VMS and used 65 K of virtual memory without a graphics package linked in. The source code is intended to be machine independent. This program is available on a 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS <b>format</b> <b>diskette</b> (standard distribution) and is also available on a 9 -track 1600 BPI ASCII CARD IMAGE magnetic tape.

Written for the nuclear propulsion project of the Space Exploration Initiative, ELM evaluates the various heat transfer coefficient and friction factor correlations available for turbulent pipe flow with heat addition. In the past, these correlations were found in different reactor analysis codes, but now comparisons are possible within one program. The logic of ELM {{is based on the}} one-dimensional conservation of energy in combination with Newton's Law of Cooling to determine the bulk flow temperature and the wall temperature across a control volume. Since the control volume is an incremental length of tube, the corresponding pressure drop is determined by application of the Law of Conservation of Momentum. The size, speed, and accuracy of ELM make it a simple tool for use in fuel element parametric studies. ELM is a machine independent program written in FORTRAN 77. It has been successfully compiled on an IBM PC compatible running MS-DOS using Lahey FORTRAN 77, a DEC VAX series computer running VMS, and a Sun 4 series computer running SunOS UNIX. ELM requires 565 K of RAM under SunOS 4. 1, 360 K of RAM under VMS 5. 4, and 406 K of RAM under MS-DOS. Because this program is machine independent, no executable is provided on the distribution media. The standard distribution medium for ELM is one 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS <b>format</b> <b>diskette.</b> ELM was developed in 1991. DEC, VAX, and VMS are trademarks of Digital Equipment Corporation.

40|$|IESIP, an Improved Exploratory Search Technique for Pure Integer Linear Programming Problems, {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} optimizing an objective function {{of one or more}} variables subject to a set of confining functions or constraints by a method called discrete optimization or integer programming. Integer programming is based on a specific form of the general linear programming problem in which all variables in the objective function and all variables in the constraints are integers. While more difficult, integer programming is required for accuracy when modeling systems with small numbers of components such as the distribution of goods, machine scheduling, and production scheduling. IESIP establishes a new methodology for solving pure integer programming problems by utilizing {{a modified version of the}} univariate exploratory move developed by Robert Hooke and T. A. Jeeves. IESIP also takes some of its technique from the greedy procedure and the idea of unit neighborhoods. A rounding scheme uses the continuous solution found by traditional methods (simplex or other suitable technique) and creates a feasible integer starting point. The Hook and Jeeves exploratory search is modified to accommodate integers and constraints and is then employed to determine an optimal integer solution from the feasible starting solution. The user-friendly IESIP allows for rapid solution of problems up to 10 variables in size (limited by DOS allocation). Sample problems compare IESIP solutions with the traditional branch-and-bound approach. IESIP is written in Borland's TURBO Pascal for IBM PC series computers and compatibles running DOS. Source code and an executable are provided. The main memory requirement for execution is 25 K. This program is available on a 5. 25 inch 360 K MS DOS <b>format</b> <b>diskette.</b> IESIP was developed in 1990. IBM is a trademark of International Business Machines.

40|$|The {{purpose for}} {{conducting}} {{this study was}} to develop a practitioner list of computer competencies for use in the training of preservice teachers. The competencies were developed through a survey of preservice teachers, cooperating-teachers, and faculty members in Teachers Colleges at the Universities of Nebraska in Lincoln, Omaha, and Kearney. ^ By use of a stratified random sampling method, 50 teacher educators, 50 preservice teachers, and 50 cooperating teachers were selected. A total of 150 surveys were mailed to the sample [...] 50 to preservice teachers, 50 to cooperating teachers, and 50 to teacher educators. A total of 131 responses were returned [...] 42 from the teacher educators, 45 from the cooperating teachers, and 44 from the preservice teachers. Thus, the rate of return for the survey was 87 percent. ^ All respondents thought the ability to initialize and <b>format</b> <b>diskettes,</b> make backups of files and disks, and operate a mouse or trackball; the ability to set up and print; and the ability to load a program from a diskette and save it were the most important competencies. Computer programming competencies were rated as least important. To answer the second research question, a MANOVA procedure was used. Statistically significant differences were found for the three groups among the five dependent variables (computer programming, software, hardware, computer literacy, and computer application) (p 3 ̆c. 10, multivariate F = 1. 82). The Wilks test value was 0. 868. ^ A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) indicated that the type of respondent was significant for the computer application dependent variable only. The results of a Tukey follow-up test for the computer application dependent variable showed the mean scores of faculty members and cooperating teachers were significantly different at the 0. 05 level. Faculty members perceived the computer applications competencies to be significantly more important than cooperating teachers. ...|$|R
40|$|RISK D/C is a {{prototype}} program which attempts to do program risk modeling for the Space Exploration Initiative (SEI) architectures {{proposed in the}} Synthesis Group Report. Risk assessment is made with respect to risk events, their probabilities, and the severities of potential results. The program allows risk mitigation strategies to be proposed for an exploration program architecture and to be ranked {{with respect to their}} effectiveness. RISK D/C allows for the fact that risk assessment in early planning phases is subjective. Although specific to the SEI in its present form, RISK D/C {{can be used as a}} framework for developing a risk assessment program for other specific uses. RISK D/C is organized into files, or stacks, of information, including the architecture, the hazard, and the risk event stacks. Although predefined, all stacks can be upgraded by a user. The architecture stack contains information concerning the general program alternatives, which are subsequently broken down into waypoints, missions, and mission phases. The hazard stack includes any background condition which could result in a risk event. A risk event is anything unfavorable that could happen during the course of a specific point within an architecture, and the risk event stack provides the probabilities, consequences, severities, and any mitigation strategies which could be used to reduce the risk of the event, and how much the risk is reduced. RISK D/C was developed for Macintosh series computers. It requires HyperCard 2. 0 or later, as well as 2 Mb of RAM and System 6. 0. 8 or later. A Macintosh II series computer is recommended due to speed concerns. The standard distribution medium for this package is one 3. 5 inch 800 K Macintosh <b>format</b> <b>diskette.</b> RISK D/C was developed in 1991 and is a copyrighted work with all copyright vested in NASA.

40|$|PDW is a Microsoft Windows {{printer driver}} for the Raytheon TDU- 850 hardcopier. It {{provides}} a previously unavailable linkage between this printer and IBM PC compatibles running Microsoft Windows. This driver supports all {{the text and}} graphics features normally found in other laser printer drivers. The user can ensure true WYSIWYG (what {{you see is what}} you get) compatibility between the on-screen display of high-end application programs and the final hardcopy image because PDW supports the unique Microsoft Windows operating system requirement that printer drivers assist in the drawing of graphical objects on the video display as well as on the hardcopier. PDW can be called upon by the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) to draw graphical objects (circles, lines, etc.) directly to the hardcopier or to render graphical objects to shared memory so that the objects can then be copied to the video screen by the screen driver. This allows Microsoft Windows, in conjunction with the screen driver, to provide maximum WYSIWYG fidelity while a document is being composed whenever PDW is selected. PDW can reside simultaneously on up to three separate PCs, each attached to a single Raytheon printer utilizing the printer's standard IEEE- 488 (GPIB) interface. PDW contains special software to check for bus contention before attempting to access the printer. PDW is written in C-language for IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS v 4. 0 or later and Microsoft Windows v 3. 0 or later. It requires 8 Mb of RAM for execution. PDW also requires a National Instruments PC-compatible GPIB board and cable and a Raytheon TDU- 850 hardcopier. If the source code needs to be modified, a Microsoft Quick C for Windows compiler is required. The Microsoft UniTool may also be required if the source code is being completely rewritten for another printer. An electronic copy of the documentation is available on the media in Microsoft Word for Windows format. The standard distribution medium for PDW is a set of two 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS <b>format</b> <b>diskettes.</b> PDW was developed in 1993...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in the development of nuclear rocket engine designs {{is to be able to}} accurately predict temperatures and pressures throughout a fission nuclear reactor core with axial hydrogen flow through circular coolant passages. CAC is an analytical prediction program to study the heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics of a circular coolant passage. CAC predicts as a function of time axial and radial fluid conditions, passage wall temperatures, flow rates in each coolant passage, and approximate maximum material temperatures. CAC incorporates the hydrogen properties model STATE to provide fluid-state relations, thermodynamic properties, and transport properties of molecular hydrogen in any fixed ortho-para combination. The program requires the general core geometry, the core material properties as a function of temperature, the core power profile, and the core inlet conditions as function of time. Although CAC was originally developed in FORTRAN IV for use on an IBM 7094, this version is written in ANSI standard FORTRAN 77 and is designed to be machine independent. It has been successfully compiled on IBM PC series and compatible computers running MS-DOS with Lahey F 77 L, a Sun 4 series computer running SunOS 4. 1. 1, and a VAX series computer running VMS 5. 4 - 3. CAC requires 300 K of RAM under MS-DOS, 422 K of RAM under SunOS, and 220 K of RAM under VMS. No sample executable is provided on the distribution medium. Sample input and output data are included. The standard distribution medium for this program is a 5. 25 inch 360 K MS-DOS <b>format</b> <b>diskette.</b> CAC was developed in 1966, and this machine independent version was released in 1992.

40|$|Accurate {{numerical}} {{prediction of}} high-temperature, chemically reacting flowfields requires {{a knowledge of}} the physical properties and reaction kinetics for the species involved in the reacting gas mixture. Assuming an 11 -species air model at temperatures below 30, 000 degrees Kelvin, SPECIES (Computer Codes for the Evaluation of Thermodynamic Properties, Transport Properties, and Equilibrium Constants of an 11 -Species Air Model) computes values for the species thermodynamic and transport properties, diffusion coefficients and collision cross sections for any combination of the eleven species, and reaction rates for the twenty reactions normally occurring. The species represented in the model are diatomic nitrogen, diatomic oxygen, atomic nitrogen, atomic oxygen, nitric oxide, ionized nitric oxide, the free electron, ionized atomic nitrogen, ionized atomic oxygen, ionized diatomic nitrogen, and ionized diatomic oxygen. Sixteen subroutines compute the following properties for both a single species, interaction pair, or reaction, and an array of all species, pairs, or reactions: species specific heat and static enthalpy, species viscosity, species frozen thermal conductivity, diffusion coefficient, collision cross section (OMEGA 1, 1), collision cross section (OMEGA 2, 2), collision cross section ratio, and equilibrium constant. The program uses least squares polynomial curve-fits of the most accurate data believed available to provide the requested values more quickly than is possible with table look-up methods. The subroutines for computing transport coefficients and collision cross sections use additional code to correct for any electron pressure when working with ionic species. SPECIES was developed on a SUN 3 / 280 computer running the SunOS 3. 5 operating system. It is written in standard FORTRAN 77 for use on any machine, and requires roughly 92 K memory.
