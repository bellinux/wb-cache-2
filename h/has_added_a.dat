5|$|In early 2010, a {{real estate}} {{developer}} approached the Cacchios with an offer to purchase the theater. A 501(c) nonprofit organization was formed in March 2010 to preserve the building, which secured a $50,000 grant from PepsiCo to help take out a $385,000 mortgage. Since completing its purchase of the theater on August 19, 2010, the Rosendale Theatre Collective <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> digital projector, surround sound system, stage thrust, and retractable screen. The group plans to add a concession stand and move the ticket booth outside during warm months. In late February 2011, the theater received a $175,000 state grant to renovate the building.|$|E

It was built as a two-lane bridge with shoulders; expansion since then <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> second lane in either direction. By the early 21st century it, like the Maroon Creek Bridge, was carrying more traffic than it had ever been expected to and was in poor structural condition.|$|E

25|$|The discoveries at Glauberg {{have added}} several new {{perspectives}} {{to the understanding}} of early Celtic Europe. They have somewhat expanded the known extent of early La Tène civilization, they have thrown much light on the early development of Celtic art, and most importantly of sculpture. The warrior figure and other material support suggestions of links and contact with the civilisations of the Mediterranean at this early point. The ritual complex surrounding the tomb <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> whole new monument type to European prehistory.|$|E

25|$|Concerns in the 1960s about {{uncontrolled}} {{housing development}} encouraged {{the establishment of}} resident's groups focused on preserving the village scene. Situated in the Chilterns AONB, and combined with national and local government planning controls there is strict enforcement of restrictions on residential building developments. This {{has led to a}} shortage in affordable and social housing. The scarcity of available property <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> premium onto house prices in Cholesbury (average selling price circa £950k as at 2007) and neighbouring villages compared to other areas in the rest of South East England.|$|E
25|$|Although {{evidence}} for a link between black cohosh and liver damage is not conclusive, Australia <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> warning to the label of all black cohosh-containing products, stating that it may cause harm to the liver in some individuals {{and should not be}} used without medical supervision. Other studies conclude that liver damage from use of black cohosh is unlikely, and that the main concern over its safe use is lack of proper authentication of plant materials and adulteration of commercial preparations with other plant species.|$|E
25|$|Holbein's {{portrait}} of Jane Meutas is a drawing {{in black and}} coloured chalks on pink prepared paper, 283 x 212 mm, and has the name 'The Lady Meutas' written clearly on its face.

25|$|Tanaka is a {{right-handed}} {{pitcher who}} throws {{from a high}} three-quarter arm slot in a drop-and-drive motion. He throws two fastballs (four-seam, two-seam) usually in the low-90s that top out at 97mph. He also has a plus 84–88mph splitter with late downward action, a solid slider in the low to mid-80s, and an occasional curveball. Tanaka <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> high-80s cutter to repertoire in his MLB career.

25|$|In New Zealand, Coronation Street {{has been}} shown locally since 1964, first on NZBC {{television}} until 1975, and then on TV One, which broadcasts it in a 4-episode/2-hour block on Fridays from 7:30pm. Since September 2014, TV One <b>has</b> <b>added</b> <b>a</b> 2-episode/1-hour block on Saturday from 8:30pm. Because TV One has never upgraded to showing the equivalent of five episodes per week, New Zealand continues to fall further and further behind with episodes, and is 23 months behind Britain (as of 28 March 2014). During the weekday nights of the week ending 11 April 2014 and previous weeks, Coronation Street was the least watched programme on TV One in the 7:30pm slot by a considerable margin in comparison to other weeknights, The serial aired on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30pm until October 2011, when the show moved to a 5:30pm half-hour slot every weekday. The move proved unpopular with fans, and the series was quickly moved into its present prime-time slot within weeks. Episodes 7883, 7884, 7885 and 7886 were screened on 16 May 2014. These were originally aired in the UK between 4 and 11 June 2012.|$|E
