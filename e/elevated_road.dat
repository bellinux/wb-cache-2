5|$|The {{station is}} located beneath Third Huaxia Road, between Qingyi Road and the Huaxia <b>Elevated</b> <b>Road.</b> Along Line 2, {{it is located}} between the Middle Chuangxin Road and Chuansha stations. It takes about 20 minutes to ride the train to the Pudong International Airport station, the eastern {{terminus}} of the line, and about 70 minutes to the East Xujing station, the west end. The station has three exits, numbered 1, 4, and 5. Exit 1 is branched northeast of the station, south of the Huaxia <b>Elevated</b> <b>Road</b> and east of Third Huaxia Road. Along the northwest side of the station is Exit 4 which is located west of Third Huaxia Road. Exit 5 is located south of Qingyi Road east of the station.|$|E
5|$|A short {{distance}} past the city line, NY5 passes over the Union Ship Canal on {{a span of}} the <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> known as the Father Baker Bridge. North of the waterway, the Skyway gains a frontage road named Fuhrmann Boulevard. Both the service road and the Skyway run parallel to Lake Erie until {{the northern end of}} the Buffalo Outer Harbor. Here, the frontage roads end while NY5 turns to the northeast, crossing the Buffalo River and entering downtown. On the north bank, the Skyway returns to a northerly routing as it passes KeyBank Center, located directly to the east, and Buffalo and Erie County Naval & Military Park, situated to the west, and meets I-190 at exit7. Past the interchange, the Skyway ends and the route descends in elevation, becoming an at-grade roadway once more at Church Street in the shadow of Buffalo City Hall. NY384 begins here, following Delaware Avenue north into the heart of downtown, while NY5 turns east onto Church.|$|E

From Pudong, motorists can access the Lupu Bridge from on-ramps to the North–South <b>Elevated</b> <b>Road</b> westbound on Yaohua Road or northbound on Jiyang Road. The North–South <b>Elevated</b> <b>Road</b> actually ends {{immediately after the}} Lupu Bridge and becomes Jiyang Road, with an off-ramp to eastbound Yaohua Road.|$|E

40|$|Road network {{provides}} the arterial network to facilitate trade, transport, social integration and economic development. It facilitates specialization, extension of markets and exploitation of economies of scale. It {{is used for}} the smooth conveyance of both people and goods. Now days, <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> are built to ease the traffic between two points to enhance accessibility and flexibility of operations. Case study represents before and after accidents impact on Panipat-flyover stretch. This study examines the impact of the construction of Panipat Expressway over the traffic scenario of the city. This study presents accident data analysis over a period of 11 years (2003 - 2013) which includes collection of 5. 5 years (Jan 2003 - June 2008) data before construction and 5. 5 years (July 2008 – Dec 2013) data after construction. The results suggest that increased provision of <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> is likely to reduce accidents. Journey and running speed is also improved due to construction of <b>elevated</b> <b>roads.</b> <b>Elevated</b> <b>roads</b> also reduce traffic congestion and conflicts resulting in a safer and more efficient circulation of traffic in the city. 1...|$|R

2500|$|West of Syracuse University, the NYSW turns west to pass under I-81. At this point, the {{embankment}} {{gives way to}} an elevated highway carrying I-81 through downtown. The road separates the 15th Ward on its west side from Syracuse University and the area's hospitals on its east side; it also visually hangs over the predominantly residential 15th Ward. Farther north, {{the density of the}} commercial districts adjacent to the highway continue to increase as the road enters downtown Syracuse. For roughly a half-mile (0.8km), I-81 heads east–west, running alongside I-690 and connecting to the highway by way of a series of closely spaced ramps. Like I-81, the incomplete interchange is entirely elevated, passing over parts of several downtown blocks. Past I-690, I-81 transitions from an <b>elevated</b> <b>road</b> to a sub-surface highway as it cuts across the north half of downtown and proceeds northwest past an old industrial area that was once Syracuse's Inner Harbor. [...] The elevated portion in Syracuse is expected to reach the end of its useful life in 2017.|$|E

60|$|It is {{said that}} the {{friendship}} started in rather a peculiar manner. There {{was at the time}} a measure before the Assembly to reduce the fare of the <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> in New York City from ten cents to five cents. After a great deal of talking, the bill passed the Assembly and then the Senate, and went to the governor for his signature. Much to the surprise of the general public Governor Cleveland vetoed the bill, stating that when the capitalists had built the <b>elevated</b> <b>roads</b> they had understood that the fare was to be ten cents, and that it was not right to deprive them of their profits. At once those who wanted the measure to become a law decided to pass it over the governor's head. When this attempt was made, Theodore Roosevelt got up boldly and said he could not again vote for the bill--that he was satisfied that Governor Cleveland's view of the matter was correct.|$|R
