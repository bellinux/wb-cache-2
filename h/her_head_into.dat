25|$|Venus {{revels in}} having the girl under her power, and turns Psyche {{over to her}} two handmaids, Worry and Sadness, to be whipped and tortured. Venus tears her clothes and bashes <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> the ground, and mocks her for conceiving {{a child in a}} sham marriage. The goddess then throws before her a great mass of mixed wheat, barley, poppyseed, chickpeas, lentils, and beans, {{demanding}} that she sort them into separate heaps by dawn. But when Venus withdraws to attend a wedding feast, a kind ant takes pity on Psyche, and assembles a fleet of insects to accomplish the task. Venus is furious when she returns drunk from the feast, and only tosses Psyche a crust of bread. At this point in the story, it is revealed that Cupid is also in the house of Venus, languishing from his injury.|$|E

25|$|Aggression among captive {{killer whales}} is common. In August 1989, a {{dominant}} female killer whale, Kandu V, attempted to rake a newcomer whale, Corky II, {{with her mouth}} during a live show, and smashed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>into</b> a wall. Kandu V broke her jaw, which severed an artery, and then bled to death. In November 2006, a dominant female killer whale, Kasatka, repeatedly dragged experienced trainer Ken Peters {{to the bottom of}} the stadium pool during a show after hearing her calf crying for her in the back pools. In February 2010, an experienced female trainer at SeaWorld Orlando, Dawn Brancheau, was killed by killer whale Tilikum shortly after a show in Shamu Stadium. Tilikum had been associated with the deaths of two people previously. In May 2012, Occupational Safety and Health Administration administrative law judge Ken Welsch cited SeaWorld for two violations in the death of Dawn Brancheau and fined the company a total of US$12,000. Trainers were banned from making close contact with the killer whales. In April 2014, the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia denied an appeal by SeaWorld.|$|E
