5|$|Metrologists {{carefully}} {{distinguish between}} {{the definition of a}} unit and its realisation. The definition of each base unit of the SI is drawn up so that it <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> provides a sound theoretical basis on which the most accurate and reproducible measurements can be made. The realisation of the definition of a unit is the procedure by which the definition may be used to establish the value and associated uncertainty of a quantity of the same kind as the unit. A description of the mise en pratique of the base units is given in an electronic appendix to the SI Brochure.|$|E

5|$|On {{both sides}} of Wijdefjorden there is High Arctic steppe vegetation, {{dominated}} by grasses and extremely dry, basic earth. There are some areas dominated by exposure of mineral earth. The area around the fjord has a vegetation which <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> not preserved {{in other areas of}} Svalbard. Along with vegetation found on nesting cliffs, it is the most exclusive flora in Svalbard. There are several exclusive species in the national park, including , Puccinellia svalbardensis, Gentianella tenella and Kobresia simpliciuscula. Of the larger fjords on Svalbard, Wijdefjorden is the least affected by humans, although a trapping station has been built at Austfjordnes.|$|E
5|$|The NDL is a {{theoretical}} time obtained by calculating inert gas uptake and release in the body, using a model {{such as the}} BÃ¼hlmann decompression algorithm. Although the science of calculating these limits has been refined over the last century, {{there is still much}} that is unknown about how inert gases enter and leave the human body. In addition, every individual's body <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> may absorb and release inert gases at different rates. For this reason, dive tables typically have a degree of safety built into their recommendations. Divers can and do suffer decompression sickness while remaining inside NDLs, though the incidence is very low.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{language}} is a philosophical problem arising from the difficulties in accurately describing God. Because God is generally conceived as incorporeal, infinite, and timeless, ordinary language cannot always apply to that entity. This makes speaking about or attributing properties to God difficult: a religious believer might simultaneously wish to describe God as good, yet also hold that God's goodness <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> cannot be articulated by human language of goodness. This raises {{the problem of how}} (and whether) God can be meaningfully spoken about at all, which causes problems for religious belief since the ability to describe and talk about God is important in religious life. The French philosopher Simone Weil expressed this problem in her work Waiting for God, in which she outlined her dilemma: she was simultaneously certain of God's love and conscious that she could not adequately describe him.|$|E

5|$|The most {{complete}} {{books on the}} Pony Express are The Story of the Pony Express and Saddles and Spurs by Raymond & Mary Settle and Roy Bloss. Settle's account is unique as {{he was the first}} writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell's papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle's work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer's background here <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account {{on the history of the}} Pony Express amongst many historians.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} the piece is {{outstanding}} and {{comparable to that of}} the artefacts found at the famous Anglo-Saxon cemetery at Sutton Hoo in Suffolk. Its design <b>is</b> <b>unique</b> <b>and</b> has no known parallels elsewhere in Anglo-Saxon jewelcrafting; its creator must {{have been one of the}} best craftworkers in the country at the time. Its shape is a significant link with early Christianity. The scallop had long been associated with love, fertility and birth and was a symbol of the classical goddesses Aphrodite and her Roman counterpart Venus, who was said to have floated ashore on a scallop shell (as in Sandro Botticelli's famous depiction of The Birth of Venus). By the 4th century, however, Christians had adopted the scallop as a symbol of rebirth through baptism and life as a journey towards a heavenly reunion with God. It came to be particularly associated with pilgrimages and was later adopted as a pilgrim's badge.|$|E
