Algebras whose {{underlying}} set is {{a complete}} partial order and whose termoperations are continuous may be equipped with a least fixed point operation x. t. The set of all equations involving the -operation which hold in all continuous algebras determines the variety of iteration algebras. A simple argument is given here reducing the axiomatization of iteration algebras to that of Wilke algebras. It is shown that Wilke algebras {{do not have a}} finite axiomatization. This fact implies that iteration algebras do not have a finite axiomatization, even by "hyperidentities"...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the current state}} and prospects of domestic organic market development in selected countries with emerging organic markets: The Czech Republic (CZ), Poland (PL), <b>Hungary</b> (<b>HU),</b> Ukraine (UA), Mexico (MX) and India (IN). While governmental support for organic farming varies across all countries studied, the organic sector is focused mainly on export markets in every country represented. The results of a two-step expert consultation indicate that development of the domestic market is mainly hampered {{by a lack of}} processing and distribution infrastructure, as well as the relatively low purchasing power of domestic consumers. Experts recommend that political support should prioritise national market development programmes for organic food (above all regional producer initiatives, vertical networks, establishment of a national organic logo). With regard to marketing measures, market development can be fostered by expanding the available range of domestic processed and convenience food, changing the price image and improving communication strategies that focus on health and quality aspects. In addition, distribution should not focus exclusively on conventional retail chains...|$|E

This result is in interesting contrast with the Daigneault-Monk representation theorem, which states that the class of representable polyadic algebras is finite schema-axiomatizable (and hence the equational theory of this class is finite schemaaxiomatizable, as well). We will also see that {{the complexity of the}} equational theory of RPEA# is also extremely high in the recursion theoretic sense. Finally, comparing the present negative results with the positive results of Ildiko Sain and Viktor Gyuris [10], the following methodological conclusions will be drawn: the negative properties of polyadic (equality) algebras can be removed by switching from what we call the "polyadic algebraic paradigm" to the "cylindric algebraic paradigm"...|$|R
40|$|Statechart Diagrams are a {{notation}} {{for describing}} behaviours {{in the framework}} of UML, the Unified Modeling Language of object-oriented systems. UML is a semi-formal language, with a precisely defined syntax and static semantics but with an only informally specified dynamic semantics. UML Statechart Diagrams differ from classical statecharts, as defined by Harel, for which formalizations and results are available in the literature. This paper sets the basis {{for the development of a}} formal semantics for UML Statechart Diagrams based on Kripke structures. This forms the first step towards model checking of UML Statechart Diagrams. We follow the approach proposed by Mikk and others: we first map Statechart Diagrams to the intermediate format of extended hierarchical automata and then we define an operational semantics for these automata. We prove a number of properties of such semantics which reflect the design choices of UML Statechart Diagrams. # The work described in this paper has been performed in the context of the ESPRIT Project n. 27439 - HIDE. y C.

In each site a warming experiment was conducted since 1999 or 2001 {{by means of}} passive night-time warming using reflective curtains that covered the vegetation at night. The treatments increased yearly average soil temperatures around 0. 8 degrees C in most of sites. Root-surface phosphatase activity values ranged between 56 mg PNP g(- 1) h(- 1) in IT and 3, 5 mg PNP g(- 1) h(- 1) in HU. Warming {{had no effect on}} root-surface phosphatase activity across the sites and only in Hungary a slight increase was detected. Plants at Mediterranean sites (IT, SP) showed a higher root-surface phosphatase activity than plants at temperate sites (WL, NL, DK). We suggest it might be an adaptation of plant species evolved under Mediterranean climate that allows them a) to compensate in wet period for the decrease in phosphatase activity, and thus P uptake, during drought periods, and/or b) to benefit from soluble organic P flushes following the frequent drying-rewetting episodes experienced by soils in Mediterranean ecosystems...|$|E

Patient chart reviews were conducted to estimate the number of outpatient cases. Among all adults ≥ 50 years, the incidence of hospitalized CAP per 100, 000 person years was: 456. 6 (CZ), 504. 6 (SK), 363. 9 (PL), and 845. 3 (HU). The average fatality rate for all adults ≥ 50 is 19. 1 %, and for each country; 21. 7 % (CZ), 20. 9 % (SK), 18. 6 % (PL), 17. 8 % (HU). Incidence, fatality, and likelihood of hospitalization increased with advancing age. Total healthcare costs of CAP in EUR was 12, 579, 543 (CZ); 9, 160, 774 (SK); 22, 409, 085 (PL); and 18, 298, 449 (HU); with hospitalization representing over 90 % of the direct costs of treatment.

40|$|Early {{nutrition}} programming as an {{origin of}} obesity is well acknowledged, {{but to what}} extent is this concept communicated to parents? In five European countries, UK, Finland (FI), Germany (DE), <b>Hungary</b> (<b>HU)</b> and Spain (ES), a total of 130 stand alone leaflets and 161 articles from parenting magazines providing information on feeding of healthy infants aged 0 - 12 months were identified and screened for nutrition programming statements. Obesity was mentioned in 8. 5 % (54 / 638) of the statements, and was the fourth most frequent outcome after allergy (20. 7 %), risk of infections (15. 5 %) and growth and development (11. 4 %). A temporal prognosis was given in 39 % of obesity related statements, 6 % referring to short- (15 years) duration of effects. So advice on obesity focuses oil the intrinsic long-term perspective of programming in contrary to other surveyed health-outcomes where only 8 % considered a lifelong approach. The major programming related behaviour concerned breast-feeding compared to formula and complementary feeding with meaningful differences concerning the recommended duration: for ES and HU the predominant advice was for exclusive breast-feeding for 6 months, for DE exclusive breast-feeding for 4 - 6 months and for UK and FI breast-feeding without further specification. In summary, statements relating to the programming of later obesity have been partially integrated into feeding information in five European countries. These Countries have slightly different breastfeeding recommendations, but consistently refer to the preventive potential of breastfeeding in general. This is important as obesity and its resulting morbidity are of increasing public health concern in developed countries...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to assess discrepancies between estimated peer and personal drinking behavior and to determine associations between perceptions of peer and personal drinking behavior among university students from <b>Hungary</b> (<b>HU),</b> Lithuania (LT), and the Slovak Republic (SK). Methods: 2, 554 freshman university students completed an online questionnaire on the frequency of their personal alcohol use, the number of heavy drinking occasions and on their perception concerning the corresponding drinking behavior of a typical student. Associations between perceived peer and personal use were analyzed by means of logistic regression, adjusting for sex. Results: The majority of students across all countries thought their peers drink more frequently and are more often involved in heavy drinking occasions than themselves. Students who perceived the frequency of peer alcohol use to be higher were more likely to drink alcohol twice a week or more often (SR: OR = 3. 81, 95 % CI = 2. 51 – 5. 79; LT: OR = 3. 16, 95 % CI = 2. 11 – 4. 75; HU: OR = 2. 10, 95 % CI = 1. 53 – 2. 87) compared with students who drink alcohol monthly or less. Those who perceived the number of peer heavy drinking occasions as high {{were more likely to report}} heavy drinking weekly or more often (SR: OR = 3. 16, 95 % CI = 1. 92 – 5. 20; LT:OR = 3. 56, 95 % CI = 2. 14 – 5. 94; HU:OR = 1. 41, 95 % CI = 0. 79 – 2. 51) compared with students who report heavy drinking less than monthly. Conclusions/Importance: University students perceived peer alcohol use to be higher than their personal use. Given the association between perceptions and personal alcohol use, future research should investigate if targeting perceptions in the surveyed countries may have an impact on alcohol use...|$|E
40|$|We used a nonintrusive field {{experiment}} {{carried out at}} six sites – Wales (UK), Denmark (DK), the Netherlands (NL), <b>Hungary</b> (<b>HU),</b> Sardinia (Italy – IT), and Catalonia (Spain – SP) – along a climatic and latitudinal gradient to examine the response of plant species richness and primary productivity to warming and drought in shrubland ecosystems. The warming treatment raised the plot daily temperature by ca. 1 ° C, while the drought treatment led {{to a reduction in}} soil moisture {{at the peak of the}} growing season that ranged from 26 % at the SP site to 82 % in the NL site. During the 7 years the experiment lasted (1999 – 2005), we used the pin-point method to measure the species composition of plant communities and plant biomass, litterfall, and shoot growth of the dominant plant species at each site. A significantly lower increase in the number of species pin-pointed per transect was found in the drought plots at the SP site, where the plant community was still in a process of recovering from a forest fire in 1994. No changes in species richness were found at the other sites, which were at a more mature and stable state of succession and, thus less liable to recruitment of new species. The relationship between annual biomass accumulation and temperature of the growing season was positive at the coldest site and negative at the warmest site. The warming treatment tended to increase the aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) at the northern sites. The relationship between annual biomass accumulation and soil moisture during the growing season was not significant at the wettest sites, but was positive at the driest sites. The drought treatment tended to reduce the ANPP in the NL, HU, IT, and SP sites. The responses to warming were very strongly related to the Gaussen aridity index (stronger responses the lower the aridity), whereas the responses to drought were not. Changes in the annual aboveground biomass accumulation, litterfall, and, thus, the ANPP, mirrored the interannual variation in climate conditions: the most outstanding change was a decrease in biomass accumulation and an increase in litterfall at most sites during the abnormally hot year of 2003. Species richness also tended to decrease in 2003 at all sites except the cold and wet UK site. Species-specific responses to warming were found in shoot growth: at the SP site, Globularia alypum was not affected, while the other dominant species, Erica multiflora, grew 30 % more; at the UK site, Calluna vulgaris tended to grow more in the warming plots, while Empetrum nigrum tended to grow less. Drought treatment decreased plant growth in several studied species, although there were some species such as Pinus halepensis at the SP site or C. vulgaris at the UK site that were not affected. The magnitude of responses to warming and drought thus depended greatly on the differences between sites, years, and species and these multiple plant responses may be expected to have consequences at ecosystem and community level. Decreases in biodiversity and the increase in E. multiflora growth at the SP site as a response to warming challenge the assumption that sensitivity to warming may be less well developed at more southerly latitudes; likewise, the fact that one of the studied shrublands presented negative ANPP as a response to the 2003 heat wave also challenges the hypothesis that future climate warming will lead to an enhancement of plant growth and carbon sequestration in temperate ecosystems. Extreme events may thus change the general trend of increased productivity in response to warming in the colder sites...|$|E
