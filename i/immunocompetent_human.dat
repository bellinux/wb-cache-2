Although PEL occurs in immunocompromised patients that are human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive, it also occurs in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> herpes virus- 8 (HHV- 8) -positive patients. Herein we present an immunocompetent, HIV-negative, CD- 20 -negative, HHV- 8 -positive patient with pleural effusion that was diagnosed as PEL.

40|$|Bartonella quintana is a fastidious, gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} bacterium {{that causes}} prolonged bacteremia in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>humans</b> and severe infections in immunocompromised individuals. We sought {{to define the}} outer membrane subproteome of B. quintana {{in order to obtain}} insight into the biology and pathogenesis of this emerging pathogen and to identify the predominant B. quintana antigens targeted by the human immune system during infection. We isolated the total membrane proteins of B. quintana and identified 60 proteins by two-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and peptide mass fingerprinting. Using the newly constructed proteome map, we then utilized two-dimensional immunoblotting with sera from 21 B. quintana-infected patients to identify 24 consistently recognized, immunoreactive B. quintana antigens that have potential relevance for pathogenesis and diagnosis. Among the outer membrane proteins, the variably expressed outer membrane protein adhesins (VompA and VompB), peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerase (PpI), and hemin-binding protein E (HbpE) were recognized most frequently by sera from patients, which is consistent with surface expression of these virulence factors during human infection.

40|$|Pathogenicity of many {{microbes}} {{relies on}} {{their capacity to}} resist innate immunity, and to survive and persist in an <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> host microbes have developed highly efficient and sophisticated complement evasion strategies. Here we show that different human pathogens including Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, {{as well as the}} fungal pathogen Candida albicans, acquire the human terminal complement regulator vitronectin to their surface. By using truncated vitronectin fragments we found that all analyzed microbial pathogens (n = 13) bound human vitronectin via the same C-terminal heparin-binding domain (amino acids 352 - 374). This specific interaction leaves the terminal complement complex (TCC) regulatory region of vitronectin accessible, allowing inhibition of C 5 b- 7 membrane insertion and C 9 polymerization. Vitronectin complexed with the various microbes and corresponding proteins was thus functionally active and inhibited complement-mediated C 5 b- 9 deposition. Taken together, diverse microbial pathogens expressing different structurally unrelated vitronectin-binding molecules interact with host vitronectin via the same conserved region to allow versatile control of the host innate immune response...|$|E

A study was undertaken to quantify JCV load in urine and peripheral blood samples of immunocompetent, apparently healthy tribal individuals of North-Eastern part of West Bengal, India for the first time. Materials and Methods: One hundred and thirteen samples of urine or blood were collected from different tribal groups of this region. For the quantitative estimation of the viral load in each sample, real-time polymerase chain reaction method using the SYBR Green dye was employed.

We report an apparently <b>immunocompetent,</b> <b>human</b> immunodeficiency virus–negative male patient who has experienced repeated HSV- 2 genital outbreaks despite receiving antiviral prophylaxis with several different drugs. Several of the HSV- 2 genital isolates from this patient have been confirmed as resistant to acyclovir and penciclovir. Antiviral resistance occurred {{in the setting of}} long-term prednisone treatment and intermittent acyclovir prophylaxis at suboptimal doses and persisted despite the cessation of oral steroid treatment. The patient’s genital herpes outbreaks were not controlled by high-dose prophylaxis with acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir. Cessation of antiviral prophylaxis resulted in reversion of this patient’s HSV- 2 isolates to acyclovir and penciclovir sensitivity, although resistant virus reappeared when antiviral prophylaxis was resumed. Transmission of a sensitive HSV- 2 strain from this patient to a female sex partner was observed. These observations confirm previous reports that {{resistance to}} acyclovir may develop during prophylactic therapy in an otherwise well, immunocompetent patient.

Objective: We readdressed the influence of GC therapy on Treg cells in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> subjects and naïve mice. Methods: Mice were treated with increasing doses of intravenous dexamethasone followed by oral taper, and Treg cells in spleen and blood were analyzed by FACS. Sixteen patients with sudden hearing loss but without an inflammatory disease received high-dose intravenous prednisolone followed by stepwise dose reduction to low oral prednisolone. Peripheral blood T reg cells were analyzed prior and after a 14 day GC therapy based on different markers. Results: Repeated GC administration to mice for three days dose-dependently decreased the absolute numbers of Treg cells in blood (100 mg dexamethasone/kg body weight: 2. 861. 8610 4 cells/ml vs. 33611610 4 in control mice) and spleen (dexamethasone: 2. 861. 9610 5 /spleen vs. 95622610 5 /spleen in control mice), which slowly recovered after 14 days taper in spleen but not in blood. The relative frequency of FOXP 3 + Treg cells amongst the CD 4 + T cells also decreased in a dose dependent manner with the effect being more pronounced in blood than in spleen.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Cryptogenic fibrosing {{alveolitis}} (synonymous with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis) is a clinically heterogeneous {{condition in}} which the precipitating factor is unclear. Both environmental and infective factors have been implicated. An association between Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis was suggested {{over a decade ago}} by a study based on EBV serology, but the significance of this has been unclear. METHODS [...] Lung tissue obtained surgically from patients (n = 20) with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis was investigated for evidence of EBV replication and compared with lung tissue from 21 control patients. Fourteen of the 20 patients had received no specific therapy for cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis at the time of biopsy. Monoclonal antibodies directed against the EBV viral antigens, EBV viral capsid antigen (VCA) and gp 340 / 220 antigen, which are expressed during the lytic phase of the EBV life cycle, were studied. RESULTS [...] Fourteen (70 %) of the 20 patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis were positive for both EBV VCA and gp 340 / 220 compared with two (9 %) of the 21 controls. In the patients with cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis viral replication was localised to pulmonary epithelial cells using epithelial cell markers, and immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the staining to be within type II alveolar cells. CONCLUSIONS [...] This is the first report of in vivo EBV replication within epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract in an <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> host. Furthermore, this suggests that EBV may be an immune trigger or contribute to lung injury in cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, thus offering a potential new avenue of treatment...|$|E
40|$|We {{have found}} that normal {{alveolar}} macrophages can kill an intracellular parasite by a mechanism that does not involve toxic metabolites of oxygen. We studied the interaction between Toxoplasma gondii and rat alveolar macrophages in vitro. We were interested in Toxoplasma because it causes pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients but not in healthy individuals, and we chose the rat because it resembles <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> subjects in being resistant to T. gondii. Resident rat alveolar macrophages could kill large numbers of T. gondii. This occurred without a respiratory burst as judged by intracellular reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium and quantitative release of superoxide. Furthermore, scavengers of toxic oxygen metabolites {{had no effect on}} the toxoplasmacidal activity of the alveolar macrophages, nor did prior exhaustion of their respiratory burst with PMA. Whereas acid pH (e. g., 4. 5 - 6. 0) rapidly kills extracellular T. gondii, raising of the intralysosomal acid pH of rat alveolar macrophages by incubating them with weak bases did not inhibit their ability to kill T. gondii. Killing of Toxoplasma occurred within 1 h of initial exposure to the alveolar macrophages. However, {{there was no evidence that}} killing preceded ingestion; Toxoplasma attached to the surface of the cell appeared viable, and when phagocytosis was blocked with sodium fluoride the organisms survived. These results indicate that rat alveolar macrophages possess a powerful nonoxidative microbicidal mechanism, which is distinct from acidification of the phagolysosome but which probably involves phagosome formation. This mechanism may be clinically relevant, for we have recently observed that human alveolar macrophages also kill T. gondii by an oxygen- independent process...|$|E

40|$|The role of host immune {{responses}} in the pathogenesis of Legionnaires' disease is incompletely understood, {{due in part to}} the current lack of an animal model that is both susceptible to replicative Legionella pneumophila-induced lung infection and for which species-specific immunological reagents are available. We have developed a model of replicative L. pneumophila lung infection in intratracheally inoculated A/J mice. L. pneumophila was obtained in the exponential growth phase and inoculated into the trachea of 6 - to 8 -week-old female A/J mice. Microbiological and histopathological evidence of infection was demonstrated in mice inoculated with 10 (6) colony-forming units. Development of an acute pneumonia that resembled human Legionnaires' disease coincided with exponential growth of the bacteria in the lung 24 to 48 hours after intratracheal inoculation of L. pneumophila. This was associated with increased plasma levels of interferon-gamma at 24 hours after inoculation. After 48 hours, the bacteria were gradually eliminated from the lung over the next 5 days, corresponding with resolution of the inflammatory response in the lung, thereby mimicking the outcome frequently seen in the <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> host. Treatment of animals with anti-interferon-gamma antibody enhanced bacterial replication and disease progression, indicating an important role of host immune response in resolution of the infection. Because of the availability of murine-specific reagents, this model of replicative L. pneumophila lung infection in A/J mice after intrapulmonary inoculation of L. pneumophila potentially provides an important tool for future studies investigating the role of host immune {{responses in}} the pathogenesis of Legionnaires' disease in the immunocompetent host...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In {{order to}} survive and persist in an <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> host, Borrelia burgdorferi {{controls}} the human im-mune attack and blocks the damaging effects of the activated complement system. These Gram-negative spirochetes use CspA (CRASP- 1) and four additional immune evasion proteins to bind combinations of human plasma regulators, including factor H, factor H-like protein 1 (FHL- 1), complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR 1), CFHR 2, CFHR 5, and plasminogen. As many microbial immune evasion proteins have multiple functions, we hypothesized that CspA has additional roles in complement or immune control. Here, we identify CspA as a terminal complement inhibitor. Borrelial CspA binds the human terminal comple-ment components C 7 and C 9 and blocks assembly andmembrane insertion of the terminal complement complex (TCC). CspA inhibits TCC assembly {{at the level of}} C 7, as revealed by hemolytic assays, and inhibits polymerization of C 9. CspA, when ectopi-cally expressed on the surface of serum-sensitive Borrelia garinii, blocks TCC assembly on the level of C 7 and induces serum resistance in the transformed bacteria.

30|$|Adenoviridae are non-enveloped, double {{stranded}} (ds), linear desoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses with a genome of 35 – 40  kb and {{a particle}} size of 70 – 100  nm (Rux & Burnett 2004). The adenoviral genome is well characterized and comparatively easy to manipulate. Most adenoviruses cause mild diseases in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> adults and by deletion of crucial {{regions of the}} viral genome the vectors can be rendered replication defective, which increases their predictability and reduces unwanted side effects. Moreover, deleted regions of the viral genome can easily be replaced by foreign genomic material encoding the therapeutically active metabolite (Tatsis & Ertl 2004). The process of adenoviral entry into the host is extremely efficient and has been intensively studied (Douglas 2007). Adenoviruses exhibit a wide host range in vitro and in vivo; this range was also seen in nondividing cells (Zhang 1999). In addition, the well-defined and easily manipulated viral genome favors the development of adenoviral vectors for gene therapy applications. A major disadvantage of adenoviral vectors is that viral DNA can effectively elicit the innate and adaptive immune response immediately after infection, leading to the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mice, primates and humans (Raper et al. 2003;Schnell et al. 2001;Zhang et al. 2001). Activation of innate immunity {{is associated with a}} reduction in efficacy of gene transfer (Worgall et al. 1997) but also in profound damage to healthy tissue and significant morbidity in transduced hosts (Raper et al. 2003;Schnell et al. 2001). Several studies focused on the immune reaction elicited through cytoplasmatic localized adenoviral DNA. This {{led to the development of}} newer generations of adenoviral vector systems that were depleted of a number of viral genes in order to reduce the immune reaction. Helper-dependent adenoviral vectors lack almost all viral coding sequences and lead to diminished adaptive immune responses and improved duration of gene transfer (Muruve 2004). However, acute toxicity and reduced vector persistence provoked by the innate immune response remain the most significant barriers to an effective clinical application of this promising technology (Brunetti-Pierri et al. 2004).|$|E

To determine which Cryptosporidium antigens invoke antibody responses in humans, we performed polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using purified oocysts, followed by Western blots with human sera from various populations. Of 40 sera from persons with cryptosporidiosis (24 AIDS and 16 non-AIDS patients), in 37 (93 %) a 23, 000 -dalton antigen measured quantitatively by laser densitometry was recognized.

In wild-type mice, a subcutaneous inoculation of either viable or inactivated B. henselae led to a strong swelling of the draining lymph node, which was long-lasting despite the rapid elimination of the bacteria. Carboxyfluorescein- and bromodesoxyuridine-labeling experiments showed that lymph node enlargement resulted from modified immigration and enhanced proliferation of lymphocytes, preferentially of B cells. A comparative analysis of B. henselae and the rodent pathogen B. grahamii in wild-type versus interferon-α/β-receptor I chain-deficient mice revealed that interferon-α/β is not only differentially induced by these two Bartonella species but also exerts an inhibitory effect on the development of lymphadenopathy both in vitro and in vivo.

CspA blocks TCC assembly and insertion when expressed at the bacterial surface. CspA is the first TCC inhibitor cloned and functionally characterized from a Gram-negative bacterium. This identification of a bacterial TCC inhibitor of pathogen origin expands our knowledge of complement evasion of pathogenic bacteria and shows that pathogenic bacteria target the terminal pathway of complement.

40|$|Herpesviruses have co-speciated {{with several}} {{vertebrate}} and invertebrate animals {{throughout the history}} of evolution. In the <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> host, primary infection is usually benign, whereafter the virus is brought into life-long latency. Viral reactivation can however cause severe disease in immunocompromised, and rarely also in immunocompetent, patients. The overall aim of this thesis was to study the immunologic effects of cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes simplex type 1 (HSV- 1) infection in neurocognitive disorders. CMV is known to promote T-cell differentiation towards a more effector-oriented phenotype, similar to what is seen in the elderly. We have addressed the frequency of CMV-specific CD 8 + T-cells in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, we have investigated whether AD patients present with a different CMV-specific immune profile, overall CD 8 phenotype or inflammatory cytokine response to anti-CD 3 /CD 28 beads, CMV pp 65 and amyloid beta. Subjects with AD presented with a lower proportion of CMV-specific CD 8 + T-cells compared to non-demented (ND) controls, but no differences in overall CD 8 differentiation were seen. Overall, AD subjects presented with a more pro-inflammatory peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) phenotype. When PBMCs were challenged with CD 3 /CD 28 -stimulation, CMV seropositive AD subjects presented with more IFN-γ release than both CMV seronegative AD subjects and CMV seropositive ND controls. For effective screening of humoral herpesvirus immunity, both in research and in clinical practice, efficient immunoassays are needed. We have addressed the methodology of multiplex herpesvirus immunoassays and related bioinformatics and investigated antibody levels in AD patients and ND controls. Subjects with AD presented with lower levels of human herpesvirus 6 (HHV- 6) IgG. However, {{there was no difference in}} HHV- 6 DNA levels in PBMCs between the groups. Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is a devastating disease, where antiviral treatment has greatly decreased mortality but not eliminated the associated long-term neurocognitive morbidity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pre- {{and early}} {{clinical}} studies on patients with autoimmune diseases suggested that induction of regulatory T(T(reg)) cells {{may contribute to}} the immunosuppressive effects of glucocorticoids (GCs). OBJECTIVE: We readdressed the influence of GC therapy on T(reg) cells in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>human</b> subjects and naïve mice. METHODS: Mice were treated with increasing doses of intravenous dexamethasone followed by oral taper, and T(reg) cells in spleen and blood were analyzed by FACS. Sixteen patients with sudden hearing loss but without an inflammatory disease received high-dose intravenous prednisolone followed by stepwise dose reduction to low oral prednisolone. Peripheral blood T(reg) cells were analyzed prior and after a 14 day GC therapy based on different markers. RESULTS: Repeated GC administration to mice for three days dose-dependently decreased the absolute numbers of T(reg) cells in blood (100 mg dexamethasone/kg body weight: 2. 8 ± 1. 8 × 10 (4) cells/ml vs. 33 ± 11 × 10 (4) in control mice) and spleen (dexamethasone: 2. 8 ± 1. 9 × 10 (5) /spleen vs. 95 ± 22 × 10 (5) /spleen in control mice), which slowly recovered after 14 days taper in spleen but not in blood. The relative frequency of FOXP 3 (+) T(reg) cells amongst the CD 4 (+) T cells also decreased in a dose dependent manner with the effect being more pronounced in blood than in spleen. The suppressive capacity of T(reg) cells was unaltered by GC treatment in vitro. In immunocompetent humans, GCs induced mild T cell lymphocytosis. However, it did not change the relative frequency of circulating T(reg) cells in a relevant manner, although there was some variation depending on the definition of the T(reg) cells (FOXP 3 (+) : 4. 0 ± 1. 5 % vs 3. 4 ± 1. 5 %*; AITR(+) : 0. 6 ± 0. 4 vs 0. 5 ± 0. 3 %, CD 127 (low) : 4. 0 ± 1. 3 vs 5. 0 ± 3. 0 %* and CTLA 4 +: 13. 8 ± 11. 5 vs 15. 6 ± 12. 5 %; * p< 0. 05). CONCLUSION: Short-term GC therapy does not induce the hitherto supposed increase in circulating T(reg) cell frequency, neither in immunocompetent humans nor in mice. Thus, it is questionable that the clinical efficacy of GCs is achieved by modulating T(reg) cell numbers...|$|E
40|$|Mucormycosis usually {{presents}} as {{a progressive}} infection with significant angio-invasion. Mucormycosis due to Mucor irregularis (formerly Rhizomucor variabilis var. variabilis), however, is exceptional in causing chronic cutaneous infection in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>humans,</b> ultimately leading to severe morbidity if left untreated. More than 90 % {{of the cases}} known to date were reported from Asia, mainly from China. The nearest neighbour of M. irregularis is the saprobic species M. hiemalis. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the taxonomic position, epidemiology, and intra- and inter-species diversity of M. irregularis based on 21 strains (clinical n = 17) by multilocus analysis using ITS, LSU, RPB 1 and RPB 2 genes, compared to results of cluster analysis with amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) data. By combining MLST and AFLP analyses, M. irregularis was found to be monophyletic with high bootstrap support, and consisted of five subgroups, which were not concordant in all partitions. It was thus confirmed that M. irregularis is a single species at 96. 1 - 100 % ITS similarity and low recombination rates between populations. Some geographic structuring was noted with some localised populations, which may be explained by limited air-dispersal. The natural habitat of the species is likely to be in soil and decomposing plant material...|$|R
40|$|Pseudallescheria boydii {{has long}} been known to cause white grain mycetoma in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>humans,</b> but it has {{recently}} emerged as an opportunistic pathogen of humans, causing potentially fatal invasive infections in immunocompromised individuals and evacuees of natural disasters, such as tsunamis and hurricanes. The diagnosis of P. boydii is problematic since it exhibits morphological characteristics similar to those of other hyaline fungi that cause infectious diseases, such as Aspergillus fumigatus and Scedosporium prolificans. This paper describes the development of immunoglobulin M (IgM) and IgG 1 κ-light chain monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) specific to P. boydii and certain closely related fungi. The MAbs bind to an immunodominant carbohydrate epitope on an extracellular 120 -kDa antigen present in the spore and hyphal cell walls of P. boydii and Scedosporium apiospermum. The MAbs do not react with S. prolificans, Scedosporium dehoogii, or a large number of clinically relevant fungi, including A. fumigatus, Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Fusarium solani, and Rhizopus oryzae. The MAbs were used in immunofluorescence and double-antibody sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (DAS-ELISAs) to accurately differentiate P. boydii from other infectious fungi and to track the pathogen in environmental samples. Specificity of the DAS-ELISA was confirmed by sequencing of the internally transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1) - 5. 8 S-ITS 2 rRNA-encoding regions of environmental isolates...|$|R
40|$|Aeromonas {{species are}} widely {{distributed}} in aquatic environments and recent studies include the genus in the emergent pathogens group {{because of its}} frequent association with local and systemic infections in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>humans.</b> Aiming to search for virulence genes in environmental strains of Aeromonas hydrophila and Aeromonas jandaei, we designed specific primers to detect act/hly A/aer complex and alt genes. Primers described elsewhere were used to detect ast. Eighty-seven strains previously identified using phenotypic and genotypic tests as A. hydrophila (41) and A. jandaei (46) were analysed {{for the presence of}} the virulence genes using PCR. DNA fragments of expected size were purified and directly sequenced. Among the 41 strains of A. hydrophila 70. 7 % (29), 97. 6 % (40) and 26. 8 % (11) possessed act/hly A/aer complex, ast and alt genes, respectively. Among the 46 strains of A. jandaei, 4. 4 % (2), 0 % (0) and 32. 6 % (15) were positive for act/hly A/aer complex, ast and alt genes, respectively. Sequencing allowed for the confirmation of amplified products using BLAST. The present work proposes a specific and rapid diagnostic method to detect the main virulence determinants of Aeromonas, a genus potentially pathogenic to humans.

40|$|Cryptococcus gattii is an {{encapsulated}} fungus {{capable of}} causing fatal disease in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>humans</b> and animals. As current antifungal therapies {{are few and}} limited in efficacy, and resistance is an emerging issue, {{the development of new}} treatment strategies is urgently required. The current study undertook a time-course analysis of the proteome of C. gattii during treatment with fluconazole (FLC), which is used widely in prophylactic and maintenance therapies. The aims were to analyze the overall cellular response to FLC, and to find fungal proteins involved in this response that might be useful targets in therapies that augment the antifungal activity of FLC. During FLC treatment, an increase in stress response, ATP synthesis and mitochondrial respiratory chain proteins, and a decrease in most ribosomal proteins was observed, suggesting that ATP-dependent efflux pumps had been initiated for survival and that the maintenance of ribosome synthesis was differentially expressed. Two proteins involved in fungal specific pathways were responsive to FLC. An integrative network analysis revealed co-ordinated processes involved in drug response, and highlighted hubs in the network representing essential proteins that are required for cell viability. This work demonstrates the dynamic cellular response of a typical susceptible isolate of C. gattii to FLC, and identified a number of proteins and pathways that could b...|$|R
40|$|Three {{clusters}} of organ transplant–associated {{lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus}} (LCMV) transmissions have been identifi ed in the United States; 9 of 10 recipients died. In February 2011, we identifi ed a fourth cluster of organ transplant–associated LCMV infections. Diabetic ketoacidosis developed in the organ donor in December 2010; she died with generalized brain edema after a short hospitalization. Both kidneys, liver, and lung were transplanted to 4 recipients; in all 4, severe posttransplant illness developed; 2 recipients died. Through multiple diagnostic methods, we identifi ed LCMV infection in all persons, including in at least 1 sample from the donor and 4 recipients by reverse transcription PCR, and sequences of a 396 -bp fragment of the {{large segment of the}} virus from all 5 persons were identical. In this cluster, all recipients developed severe illness, but 2 survived. LCMV infection should be considered as a possible cause of severe posttransplant illness. Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), an Old World arenavirus, family Arenaviridae, is a zoonotic virus maintained in the house mouse (Mus musculus) and can be carried by pet and laboratory rodents (1 – 7); human exposure occurs through aerosolized excreta or by direct rodent contact.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{free-living}} amoeba Balamuthia mandrillaris {{may cause}} fatal encephalitis both in immunocompromised and in – apparently – <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>humans</b> and other mammalian species. Rapid, specific, sensitive, and reliable detection requiring little pathogen-specific expertise {{is an absolute}} prerequisite for a successful therapy and a welcome tool for both experimental and epidemiological research. Results A real-time polymerase chain reaction assay using TaqMan ® probes (real-time PCR) was established specifically targeting the RNase P gene of B. mandrillaris amoebae. The assay detected at least 2 (down to 0. 5) genomes of B. mandrillaris grown in axenic culture. It did not react with DNA from closely related Acanthamoeba (3 species), nor with DNA from Toxoplasma gondii, Leishmania major, Pneumocystis murina, Mycobacterium bovis (BCG), human brain, various mouse organs, or from human and murine cell lines. The assay efficiently detected B. mandrillaris DNA in spiked cell cultures, spiked murine organ homogenates, B. mandrillaris -infected mice, and CNS tissue-DNA preparations from 2 patients with proven cerebral balamuthiasis. This novel primer set was successfully combined with a published set that targets the B. mandrillaris 18 S rRNA gene in a duplex real-time PCR assay to ensure maximum specificity and as a precaution against false negative results. Conclusion A real-time PCR assay for B. mandrillaris amoebae is presented, that is highly specific, sensitive, and reliable and thus suited both for diagnosis and for research. </p...|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the genus}} Bartonella are {{maintained}} in many domesticated and wild animal hosts. Bartonella henselae, the best understood species, infects housecats {{and other members of}} the Felidae. Additional species of Bartonella are found in cats, dogs, livestock, rodents, rabbits and other wild and domesticated animals. In <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>humans,</b> B. henselae causes cat scratch disease, which is most often a relatively benign and self-limiting illness. In contrast, B. henselae infections are often severe in immunocompromised individuals, and can be fatal without antibiotic treatment. Other species of Bartonella have also been linked occasionally to human illnesses, with varying levels of evidence for a causative role. The significance of Bartonella spp. as pathogens for animals is currently unclear. The vast majority of infections are asymptomatic, and although these organisms have been implicated occasionally in illnesses, proving a causative role is difficult. Etiology Bartonella spp. are fastidious, pleomorphic, Gram negative rods in the family Bartonellaceae, α- 2 subgroup of the Proteobacteria. More than 20 species of Bartonella have been described in animals. B. henselae (formerly Rochalimaea henselae) is the major agent of cat scratch disease, and a causative agent for bacillary angiomatosis, peliosis hepatis and possibly other conditions. There is some evidence that genotypes or strains of B. henselae might vary in their zoonotic potential. Other Bartonella species suggested to be pathogens in people and/or animals include B...|$|R

40|$|Cytomegalovirus (CMV), a {{prevalent}} pathogen, causes severe {{disease in}} immunocompromised humans. However, present understanding is limited regarding the long-term clinical effect of persistent CMV infection in immunocompetent adults. The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study (1992 - 2002) of 635 community-dwelling women in Baltimore, Maryland, aged 70 - 79 {{years in the}} Women's Health and Aging Studies to {{examine the effect of}} CMV infection on the risk of frailty, a common geriatric syndrome, and mortality in older women. The effect of baseline serum CMV antibody (immunoglobulin G) concentration on the risk of 3 -year incident frailty, defined by using a 5 -component measure, and 5 -year mortality was examined with Cox proportional hazards models. Compared with those who were CMV seronegative, women in the highest quartile of CMV antibody concentration had a greater incidence of frailty (hazard ratio = 3. 46, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 45, 8. 27) and mortality (hazard ratio = 3. 81, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 64, 8. 83). After adjustment for potential confounders, CMV antibody concentration in the highest quartile independently increased the risk of 5 -year mortality (hazard ratio = 2. 79, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 22, 6. 40). Better understanding of the long-term clinical consequences of CMV infection in <b>immunocompetent</b> <b>humans</b> is needed to guide public health efforts for this widely prevalent infection...|$|R
