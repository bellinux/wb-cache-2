5|$|Amanda {{encounters}} several antagonists {{over the}} course of the game, including hostile humans and androids. These foes can be defeated with gunplay or other offensive means. There is also a single alien creature that pursues the player. The alien creature cannot be defeated, requiring the player to use stealth tactics in order to survive. Instead of following a predetermined path, the alien has the ability to actively investigate disturbances and hunt the player by sight or sound. Along the way, the player can use both a flashlight and a motion tracker to detect the alien's movements. However, using any of these increases the chance of the alien finding the player. For example, if the alien is moving and close enough, the tracker's sound will attract the alien, forcing the player to wisely use the tracker and remove it as soon as it detects motion. The motion tracker cannot detect enemies when they are not moving and cannot determine whether the alien creature <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the ducts or on ground level.|$|E

The government consists of a Mayor and a four-member Township Council, with all positions elected at-large on a partisan basis as part of the November general election. A Mayor is elected directly by the voters to a three-year term of office. Council members serve a term of three years, which are staggered so that two seats come up for election {{in the first two years}} of a three-year cycle and the mayoral seat <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the third year.|$|E

500|$|Matilda Alice Victoria Wood (12 February 1870– 7 October 1922), professionally {{known as}} Marie Lloyd was an English music hall singer, comedian and musical theatre actress. She {{was best known}} for her {{performances}} of songs such as [...] "The Boy I Love <b>Is</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> the Gallery", [...] "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)" [...] and [...] "Oh Mr Porter What Shall I Do". [...] She received both criticism and praise for her use of innuendo and double entendre during her performances, but enjoyed a long and prosperous career, during which she was affectionately called the [...] "Queen of the Music Hall".|$|E
500|$|Born in London, she was showcased by {{her father}} at the Eagle Tavern in Hoxton. [...] In 1884, she made her {{professional}} début as Bella Delmere; she changed her stage name to Marie Lloyd the following year. [...] In 1885, she had success with her song [...] "The Boy I Love <b>Is</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> the Gallery", and she frequently topped the bill at prestigious theatres in London's West End. [...] In 1891, she was recruited by the impresario Augustus Harris to appear in that year's spectacular Theatre Royal, Drury Lane Christmas pantomime Humpty Dumpty. She starred in a further two productions at the theatre, Little Bo Peep (1892) and Robinson Crusoe (1893). [...] By the mid-1890s, Lloyd was in frequent dispute with Britain's theatre censors due to the risqué content of her songs.|$|E
500|$|Lloyd {{established}} her {{new name}} on 22 June 1886, with an {{appearance at the}} Falstaff Music Hall, where she attracted wide notice for the song [...] "The Boy I Love <b>Is</b> <b>Up</b> <b>in</b> the Gallery" [...] (which was initially written for Nelly Power by Lloyd's agent George Ware). By 1887, her performance of the song had become so popular {{that she was in}} demand in London's West End, including the Oxford Music Hall, where she excelled at skirt dancing. George Belmont, the Falstaff's proprietor, secured her an engagement at the Star Palace of Varieties in Bermondsey. She soon began making her own costumes, a skill she learned from her mother, and one she used {{for the rest of her}} career. She undertook a month-long tour of Ireland at the start of 1886, earning £10 per week after which she returned to East London to perform at, amongst others, the Sebright Music Hall, Bethnal Green. On 23 October, The Era called her [...] "a pretty little soubrette who dances with great dash and energy." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{new show}} in London in 1912 showcased {{the best of}} music hall's talent. [...] The Royal Command Performance {{took place at the}} Palace Theatre in London, which was managed by Alfred Butt. The show was {{organised}} by Oswald Stoll, an Australian impresario who managed a string of West End and provincial theatres. [...] Stoll, although a fan of Lloyd's, disliked the vulgarity of her act and championed a return to a more family-friendly atmosphere within the music hall. Because of this, and her participation in the earlier music hall war, Stoll left her out of the line-up. He placed an advert in The Era {{on the day of the}} performance warning that [...] "Coarseness and vulgarity etc are not allowed... this intimation is rendered necessary only by a few artists". In retaliation, Lloyd staged her own show at the London Pavilion, advertising that [...] "every one of her performances was a command performance by order of the British public". She performed [...] "One Thing Leads to Another", [...] "Oh Mr Porter", and [...] "The Boy I Love <b>Is</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the Gallery" [...] and was hailed as [...] "the Queen of Comedy" [...] by critics. The same year, she travelled to Devon where she appeared at the Exeter Hippodrome to much success. The Devon and Exeter Gazette, reported that Lloyd's performance of [...] "Every Movement Tells a Tale", was [...] "thoroughly enjoyed" [...] by the audience and [...] " [...] round after round of applause". [...] The paper also praised her recital of a [...] "Cockney girl's honeymoon in Paris", which was met by [...] "roars of laughter".|$|E
2500|$|According to Tolkien, Lewis' {{hostility to}} Campbell was {{grounded}} in residual Anti-Catholicism from his upbringing in Northern Ireland. [...] But hatred of our church is {{after all the}} real only final foundation of the C of E — so deep laid that it remains even when all the superstructure seems removed (C.S.L. for instance reveres the Blessed Sacrament, and admires nuns!). Yet if a Lutheran is put in jail he <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> arms; but if Catholic priests are slaughtered — he disbelieves it (and I daresay really thinks they asked for it). In the aftermath, Campbell joined Tolkien and Lewis at several meetings of the Inklings at The Eagle and Child where his [...] "poetry, political views, and religious perspectives caused quite a stir." ...|$|E
2500|$|A sequel, Jolson Sings Again (1949), {{opened at}} Loew's State Theatre in New York and {{received}} positive reviews: [...] "Mr. Jolson's name <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> lights again and Broadway is wreathed in smiles", wrote Thomas Pryor in The New York Times. [...] "That's {{as it should}} be, for Jolson Sings Again is an occasion which warrants some lusty cheering...". Jolson did a tour of New York film theaters to plug the movie, traveling with a police convoy to make timetables for all showings, often ad libbing jokes and performing songs for the audience. Extra police were on duty as crowds jammed the streets and sidewalks at each theater Jolson visited. In Chicago, a few weeks later, he sang to 100,000people at Soldier Field, and later that night appeared at the Oriental Theatre with George Jessel where 10,000people had to be turned away.|$|E

He also stated that the future of the band <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the air following the project's completion, saying: [...] "as I said {{at the beginning of the}} Teargarden project, I looked at it like, OK, I'm going to take this journey, and when this journey is over—which it now will be with Day for Night—it will [...] be the beginning [...] a new era of what the Smashing Pumpkins could be in the 21st century, or it will be the end.

2500|$|Further {{evidence}} for the reported text theory is provided in how other plays are used throughout The Contention. For example, Marlowe's The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus is quoted in the witchcraft scene ("Now Faustus, what wouldst thou have me do?" [...] (1.3.36) is reproduced as [...] "Now Bolingbroke, what wouldst thou have me do?"), and Marlowe's Edward II is paraphrased in Act 3, Scene 1 (Marlowe's [...] "The wild O'Neill, with swarms of Irish kerns,/Lives uncontrolled within the English pale" [...] (2.2.163–164) becomes [...] "The wild O'Neill, my lords, <b>is</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> arms,/With troops of Irish kerns that uncontrolled/Doth plant themselves within the English pale"). Even a line from 3 Henry VI is used in Act 3, Scene 1 ("If our King Henry had shook hands with death" [...] (1.4.103)), all of which seems to suggest that, as is so often {{the case in the}} bad quartos, the reporter was filling in blanks (i.e. passages he couldn't remember) with extracts from other plays.|$|E
