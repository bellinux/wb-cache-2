50|$|The {{perimeter}} of Coney Island features man made structures designed {{to maintain its}} current shape. The beaches are currently not a natural feature with replenishing sand being cut off by the jetty at Breezy Point, Queens. Sand has been redeposited on the beaches via beach nourishment since 1922-1923, the first such project ever, and is {{held in place by}} around two-dozen groynes. Sheepshead Bay on the east side is, for the most part, <b>enclosed</b> in <b>bulkheads.</b>|$|R

The strakes were <b>enclosed</b> by transverse <b>bulkheads</b> of the same thickness. For much of the length of the main belt there was an upper belt of high-tensile steel, [...] thick, intended as splinter protection.|$|R

50|$|When {{a survey}} by the United States Army Corps of Engineers showed the harbor at Yaquina Bay to be deeper than had been supposed, {{interest}} in development of the area boomed. In April 1883, the beach front at Newport was <b>enclosed</b> by a <b>bulkhead</b> and filled to form Front Street, the first street in Newport, which effectively functioned as a long pier along the bay front. By 1885, the Oregon Pacific Railroad had been built from the Willamette Valley all the way through to Yaquina City.|$|R
500|$|The ship's {{waterline}} armor belt had {{a maximum}} thickness of [...] amidships and tapered to [...] towards {{the ends of}} the ship. Between the main gun barbettes it covered the entire side of the ship up {{to the level of the}} upper deck. The ends of the central armored citadel were <b>enclosed</b> by transverse <b>bulkheads</b> [...] thick. The forward barbette, the conning tower, and gun turrets were also protected by 150-millimeter armor while the aft barbette only had [...] of armor. Her deck armor ranged from [...] thick and the 6-inch guns on the upper deck were protected by gun shields.|$|R
50|$|The {{compartment}} outward of the inclined armor belt had {{a maximum}} depth of 1.5 m, {{and had a}} filling of ébonite mousse. Inward of this compartment, there was a 18 mm <b>bulkhead,</b> <b>enclosing</b> a void compartment 0.9 m deep, then an oil fuel bunker 3.4 m deep (0.5 m less than on Dunkerque), then a 10 mm bulkhead, containing a void compartment 0.67 m deep, backed by a 30 mm torpedo bulkhead of special steel. The maximum width was around 7 m. The reduction of 0.5 m comparing with Dunkerque was necessary to accommodate the boiler room design.|$|R
50|$|The ship's {{waterline}} armor belt had {{a maximum}} thickness of 150 mm amidships and tapered to 70 mm towards {{the ends of}} the ship. Between the main gun barbettes it covered the entire side of the ship up {{to the level of the}} upper deck. The ends of the central armored citadel were <b>enclosed</b> by transverse <b>bulkheads</b> 120 mm thick. The forward barbette, the conning tower, and gun turrets were also protected by 150-millimeter armor while the aft barbette only had 100 mm of armor. Her deck armor ranged from 20 to 40 mm thick and the 6-inch guns on the upper deck were protected by gun shields.|$|R
5000|$|The armour {{protection}} of the Renown-class ships {{was similar to that}} of Indefatigable; her waterline belt of Krupp cemented armour measured 6 in thick amidships. It ran from the midpoint of [...] "A" [...] barbette to the midpoint of [...] "Y" [...] barbette, a length of 462 ft, and was 9 ft high. Strakes of three-inch armour aft and four-inch armour forward continued the belt towards the ends of the ship, although neither reached the bow or the stern. The strakes were <b>enclosed</b> by transverse <b>bulkheads</b> of the same thickness. For much of the length of the main belt there was an upper belt of high-tensile steel, 1.5 in thick, intended as splinter protection.|$|R
50|$|The {{compartment}} {{outboard of}} the inclined armor belt had a maximum depth of 1.5 m and {{was filled with}} ébonite mousse. Inboard of this compartment, there was a 16 mm <b>bulkhead,</b> <b>enclosing</b> a void compartment 0.9 m deep, then an oil fuel bunker 3.9 m deep, then a 10 mm bulkhead containing a void compartment 0.70 m deep, backed by a 30 mm torpedo bulkhead of special steel. Abeam the magazines fore and aft, the torpedo bulkhead thickness was increased to 40-50 mm, and the fuel bunkers were replaced by a same-depth compartment filled with ébonite-mousse. The maximum depth was around 7.5 meters. This figure exceeded the depth of underwater protection on existing battleships, where it {{was no more than}} 5 meters.|$|R
5000|$|Coney Island Creek {{was still}} a {{minimally}} navigable waterway over its 3 mile length through {{the turn of the}} 20th century. In a period from the late 19th century through the early 20th century there were plans to turn the creek into the Gravesend Ship Canal. [...] The plan including re-dredging the creek into a canal running in a straight east-west line and filling all the marsh land either side of the creek to expand the urban grid {{to the edge of the}} canal. [...] The plan was eventually abandoned and by 1924 local land owners had filled a portion of the creek. A major section of the creek was further filled in to allow construction of the Belt Parkway in the 1930s. More fill was added in 1962 with the construction of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. This turned Coney Island Creek into an inlet with the western and eastern ends of the island becoming peninsulas. None of the creek remains at the eastern end and that terminus, Sheepshead Bay, has been dredged and, for the most part, <b>enclosed</b> in <b>bulkheads.</b> The path of the landfill of what used to be the creek follows Shore Parkway, Guider Avenue, and the triangular block between Neptune Avenue and Cass Place to a bulkhead at Sheepshead Bay.|$|R
500|$|Dunderbergs contract, as {{the ship}} was now named by Webb, was amended on 27 August to specify her armor scheme. Above the main deck, her armor was to be [...] thick. From the main deck {{to a depth of}} [...] below the waterline, the armor was to be [...] thick, {{tapering}} to [...] at its lower edge. The ship's main and casemate deck armor was [...] thick except {{at the rear of the}} ship. The main deck, from the rear of the casemate to the stern, was to consist of 4.5-inch armor plates that tapered to 2.5 inches in thickness. Dunderberg was to be given a complete double bottom and her engine and boiler rooms were to be completely <b>enclosed</b> by watertight <b>bulkheads.</b> She was also to be provided with two masts and the appropriate rigging.|$|R

50|$|Internally {{there was}} a single large inner space, lacking {{bulkheads}} separating the driver positions at both ends from the fighting room in the middle. This not being cluttered with girders, the most efficient position for the mechanical parts could be chosen, further decreasing weight and height. In the front the driver was seated on the left with the machine-gunner at his right. As {{there was a}} dual drive capacity, a second driver in the rear could immediately reverse the vehicle in an emergency situation without making a turn; he also could operate the rear machine-gun. To his left was the engine, <b>enclosed</b> by asbestos-reinforced <b>bulkheads</b> that formed a small engine compartment; these could be quickly removed to allow for repairs without leaving the vehicle. The engine could be accessed from the outside through a small subrectangular hatch in the roof or a large double hatch on the back that also provided ventilation, the slits being protected by conspicuous raised longitudinal covers. As the vehicle was largely symmetrical, {{it was not always}} easy to tell the front from the back, especially if the turret was reversed. This Landsverk turret was slightly less modern in appearance, {{in the form of a}} truncated cone; the turret originally designed for the Pantrado 2 had been lower and sleeker. In it were the commander and gunner, bringing the total number of crew members to five.|$|R
