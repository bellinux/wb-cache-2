5|$|Meanwhile, Kadaj and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>are</b> {{recruiting}} children {{infected with}} Geostigma. Denzel falls {{in with the}} group, attracted by their promises of a cure for the disease. Loz follows Tifa and Marlene to Aerith's church, where they had gone looking for Cloud, and attacks them. Tifa is knocked unconscious in the fight and Loz kidnapped Marlene. All the kidnapped children are taken to {{the ruins of the}} mystical Forgotten City, where Kadaj embraces them as brethren and announces his intention for them all to be reunited with Jenova. When Cloud arrives to rescue them, he is overpowered by Kadaj's gang, but is rescued by his old comrade Vincent Valentine. Demoralized by his failure, Cloud asks if sin can ever be truly forgiven, to which Vincent nonchalantly replies that he has never tried to forgive. Cloud decides to keep fighting and returns to the city, where Kadaj has summoned Bahamut SIN and other monsters to terrorize the population. With the help of his companions from Final Fantasy VII, Cloud engages and defeats the monsters.|$|E
25|$|Prosper {{associates}} Palladius' {{appointment with}} the visits of Germanus of Auxerre to Britain to suppress Pelagianism {{and it has been}} suggested that Palladius and his colleagues were sent to Ireland to ensure that exiled Pelagians did not establish themselves among the Irish Christians. The appointment of Palladius and his fellow-bishops was not obviously a mission to convert the Irish, but more probably intended to minister to existing Christian communities in Ireland. The sites of churches associated with Palladius and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>are</b> close to royal centres of the period: Secundus is remembered by Dunshaughlin, County Meath, close to the Hill of Tara which is associated with the High King of Ireland; Killashee, County Kildare, close to Naas with links with the kings of Leinster, is probably named for Auxilius. This activity was limited to the southern half of Ireland, and there is no evidence for them in Ulster or Connacht.|$|E

Daniel Cooke, Computer Science Department Chair, and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>are</b> working {{to develop the}} technical content of the Intelligent Systems Program, and have been awarded a five-year budget valued at $350million. University scientists have also teamed with NASA's guidance, navigation, and control engineers to develop the Onboard Abort Executive (OAE), software capable of quickly deciding {{the best course of}} action during an ascent failure. The Texas Tech Space Research Initiative has also partnered with NASA to perfect methods for growing fresh vegetables in space and to determine the most efficient ways to recycle wastewater. [...] In November 1996, the university dedicated the Charles A. Bassett II Pulse Laboratory to honor engineering alumnus and Gemini-era astronaut Charles A. Bassett II. [...] In total, Texas Tech has helped to produce three astronauts: Bassett, Paul Lockhart, and Rick Husband; Husband was commander of STS-107, the final flight of Space Shuttle Columbia.|$|E

500|$|Additionally, Fischbach and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>are</b> {{working on}} the Simons Simplex Collection (SSC), which is {{designed}} to identify genetic factors that increase the risk of autism. [...] Over 100 researchers and 13 universities have interviewed and collected blood samples from more than 2000 families to look for a genetic linkage to autism. The majority of tested individuals have moderate to severe autistic symptoms and do not display high levels of intellectual disability. [...] Additionally, autistic individuals from enrolled SSC families exhibit genetic deletions, duplications, and copy number variants (CNVs) that are not present in unaffected family members. [...] Siblings serve as ideal control groups to identify unique CNVs associated with autism. [...] Although CNVs are rare and are found in only up to 1% autistic individuals, the presence of multiple CNVs in autistic individuals may account for a larger fraction of autism cases. Ultimately, the goal of the SSC is to expand the number of individuals enrolled in the program in hope of identifying penetrant CNVs, small de novo mutations, and single nucleotide polymorphisms that are linked to a higher risk of autism.|$|E
500|$|Ferris Jabr of New Scientist {{approved}} of Contagion for accurately portraying the [...] "successes and frustrations" [...] of science. Jabr cites story {{elements such as}} [...] "the fact that before researchers can study a virus, they {{need to figure out}} how to grow it in cell cultures in the lab, without the virus destroying all the cells" [...] as examples of accurate depictions of science. Carl Zimmer, a science commentator, praised the film, stating, [...] "It shows how reconstructing the course of an outbreak can provide crucial clues, such as how many people an infected person can give a virus to, how many of them get sick, and how many of them die." [...] He also describes a conversation with the film's scientific consultant, W. Ian Lipkin, in which Lipkin defended the rapid generation of a vaccine in the film. Zimmer wrote that [...] "Lipkin and <b>his</b> <b>colleagues</b> <b>are</b> now capable of figuring out how to trigger immune reactions to exotic viruses from animals in a matter of weeks, not months. And once they've created a vaccine, they don't have to use Eisenhower-era technology to manufacture it in bulk." [...] Paul Offit, a pediatrician and vaccination expert, stated that [...] "typically when movies take on science, they tend to sacrifice the science in favor of drama. That wasn't true here." [...] Offit appreciated the film's usage of concepts such as R0 and fomites, as well as the fictional strain's origins, which was based on the Nipah virus.|$|E
