The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe Finnish parents ’ prenatal breastfeeding attitudes and their relationships with demographic characteristics. Methods: The electronic Breastfeeding Knowledge, Attitude and Confidence scale was developed and 172 people (123 mothers, 49 fathers) completed the study.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe Finnish parents' prenatal breastfeeding attitudes and their relationships with demographic characteristics. Methods The electronic Breastfeeding Knowledge, Attitude and Confidence scale was developed and 172 people (123 mothers, 49 fathers) completed the study. The data were analysed using factor analysis and nonparametric methods. Results Breastfeeding was regarded as important, but 54 % of the respondents wanted both parents to feed the newborn. The mean rank values of breastfeeding attitudes differed significantly when parity, gender, education, age, breastfeeding history and level of breastfeeding knowledge were considered.

Respondents with high levels of breastfeeding knowledge did not appear concerned about equality in feeding. Conclusions Both mothers and fathers found breastfeeding important. A father's eagerness to participate in their newborn's life should be included in prenatal breastfeeding counselling and ways in which to support breastfeeding discussed. Relevant information about breastfeeding should focus on the parents who are expecting their first child, those who are young, those with low levels of education or those who have gaps in breastfeeding knowledge, so that fears and negative views can be resolved. </p...|$|E

Along with the rapid development of <b>higher</b> <b>vocational</b> education in our country, the number of <b>higher</b> <b>vocational</b> colleges has become larger than that of undergraduate colleges. But, quite a few <b>higher</b> <b>vocational</b> colleges are upgraded from secondary vocational schools. Although they still belong to the institutions of the higher learning, the educational ideas and positioning of them are totally different from those of undergraduate colleges. So the teaching reform of physical education must change based on the new situation of <b>higher</b> <b>vocational</b> physical education teaching environments. Through the analysis about the present situation of <b>higher</b> <b>vocational</b> colleges, the author puts forward the idea and thoughts of education reform as below. ...|$|R
