[...] Stephanie Vander Weide of Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "C" [...] grade rating. She said that she liked the premise of the episode, but felt that the execution was sub-par, describing the augments as [...] "Khannabees" [...] and expressing her disappointment in the actions of Captain Archer.

2500|$|The {{noticeable}} {{disparity between}} the University of Edinburgh's research capacity, endowment and international status on the one hand, and its ranking in national league tables on the other, is largely {{on account of the}} central role which 'student satisfaction' plays in the latter. The University of Edinburgh was ranked bottom in the UK for teaching quality by its students in the 2012 National Student Survey. According to The Times and Sunday Times Good University Guide 2015, [...] "The university is trying to address undergraduates' concerns with a new personal tutor system and a peer support scheme.

In the 2017 guide, Edinburgh fell to its worst ever position of joint 37th (placed with local Heriot-Watt University) in a domestic league table. The fall was attributed to lower NSS scores combined with a significant drop (78.6% to 73%) in the prospects of its graduates.|$|E

[...] He {{was impressed with}} the graphics and the isometric three-quarter top down view, but felt the game lacked a sense of grandeur. He concluded [...] "The game has all the elements of a great quest -- what keeps it a bit lacking though is that nothing you do in the game really feels all that important. It's an enjoyable time, but most of the battles and quests feel rather trivial." [...] Matt Casamassina scored all other versions of the game 7.5 out of 10, feeling the gameplay was too similar to, and not as good as, Zelda games; [...] "try as this game may to copy Zelda, it lacks the intuitiveness and polish of the franchise, and this drawback is noticeable." [...] However, he praised the combat and the graphics. He concluded [...] "it's a well-made adventure game that will absolutely provide a good amount of entertainment and satisfaction for those seeking it.
