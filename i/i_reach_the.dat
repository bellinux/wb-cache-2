2500|$|In Tyler’s works, the {{characters}} are the driving forces behind the stories and {{the starting point for}} her writing: [...] “I do make a point of writing down every imaginable facet of my characters before I begin a book, trying to get to know them so I can figure out how they’ll react in any situation…..My reason for writing now is to live lives other than my own, and I do that by burrowing deeper and deeper….till <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> center of those lives.” ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> bottom muddy {{and bruised}} about the elbows, but safe.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> {{mainland}} again <b>I</b> {{had sworn}} that I had been floating.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> chamber where Oliver sat {{brooding}} alone, for Japhet was {{patrolling the}} line.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am getting}} deadly cold, all over, Ralph. I can't sink, of course; but I shall freeze to death, before <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> {{opposite}} bank." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see; you can't {{reply to}} a message you didn't get. But I'll send him round when <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> garage, if you like--and there's the telephone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I’ll {{call out}} when <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> water," [...] said Benson; [...] "then pay out three yards more quickly so that I {{can get to}} the bottom." ...|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> {{foot of the}} stairs, {{my father}} called me into his study.|$|R
60|$|Tal Hajus arose, and I, half fearing, half anticipating his intentions, {{hurried to}} the winding runway {{which led to the}} floors below. No one was near to {{intercept}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> main floor of the chamber unobserved, taking my station {{in the shadow of the}} same column that Tars Tarkas had but just deserted. As <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> floor Tal Hajus was speaking.|$|R
60|$|At last <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> belt of trees, and {{my fears}} grew into certainty. The place was deserted.|$|R
6000|$|... "My train {{leaves in}} an hour or so. <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> steamer at Southampton about three in the morning, and she starts with the full tide at six." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not more 'n {{three or}} four days. I'm expectin' word from Bimbel as soon as <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> Junction, and then I'll know just what {{he wants us to}} do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Leaping, you know, is a froglike accomplishment," [...] {{continued}} the Frogman modestly, [...] "but {{please tell me}} what I am to do when <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> {{other side of the}} wall." ...|$|E
60|$|But several inquiries, {{made here}} and there, set me right, and at length <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> large, open corridor.|$|R
60|$|Moving the opera-glass {{slowly along}} the {{semicircle}} formed by the seats, I suddenly stopped when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> middle.|$|R
60|$|I {{passed them}} both, and when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> crown <b>I</b> was riding {{level with the}} little, {{hard-faced}} English huntsman.|$|R
60|$|Then he said slowly:--"In {{despite the}} many {{weaknesses}} of your education, {{you have been}} good to me. I will speak of your tobacco when <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> Gods. I owe you much thanks for many kindnesses.|$|E
6000|$|... "You cannot {{imagine how}} sorry I am, prince," [...] she said, [...] "but {{as it is}} I must take a special train from Kendal, {{if there is not}} one {{starting}} soon after <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> station. I wish to reach London either this evening or very early in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You doubtless {{remember}} that by our father's will, Miles, my property becomes your's, if I die without children before <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> age of twenty-one; while your's {{would have been}} mine under the same circumstances. As I am barely twenty, {{it is out of}} my power to make a legal will." ...|$|E
60|$|I peered keenly {{into the}} blackness. At length <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> slope. Here <b>I</b> dropped to {{my hands and}} knees.|$|R
60|$|Afterward I {{learned that}} thern spies had {{been aware of}} my coming for hours before <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> hidden fortress.|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> hotel <b>I</b> found Miss Gage at the door, and Kendricks {{coming out}} of the office toward her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Liberty, Signore! We are our own masters; we {{have been}} so since the day when our fathers sacked the castles of the barons, and {{compelled}} their tyrants to become their equals. I think of this each time <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> warm plains of Italy, and return to my cottage a more contented man, for the reflection." ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> marble-streeted town, [...] Whose [...] "Sound" [...] outbreathes its air [...] Of sharp sea-salts; I see the {{movement}} {{up and down}} [...] As when she was there. Ships of all countries come and go, [...] The bandsmen boom in the sun [...] A throbbing waltz; The schoolgirls laugh along the Hoe [...] As when she was one.|$|E
6000|$|... [5] Laplace assumed his {{nebulosity}} heterogeneous, {{merely that}} [...] {{he might be}} thus enabled {{to account for the}} breaking up of the [...] rings; for had the nebulosity been homogeneous, they would not [...] have broken. <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> same result—heterogeneity of the [...] secondary masses immediately resulting from the atoms—purely [...] from an à priori consideration of their general [...] design—Relation.|$|E
50|$|He {{was educated}} at Radley College, Abingdon {{and served in}} the Irish Guards in World War <b>I</b> <b>reaching</b> <b>the</b> rank of Lieutenant.|$|R
6000|$|At length <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> next corner. On {{it stood}} a splendid {{building}} of marble, having {{over the door}} in raised letters:-- ...|$|R
60|$|In {{process of}} time <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> front, and chanced to {{arrive on the}} field of action at a {{somewhat}} critical moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is no {{possible}} to waken him? Escucha Vd, and please try to comprehend. If <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> sugar-mill too late {{you will be}} paid exactly what the Alcalde at Oratava says is your due. If I get there in time, and not otherwise, you will receive what I promised you. Now take out one of those horses, and I will help you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This instant," [...] he said. [...] "It will be slow enough {{work at the}} best, and we mustn't lose time. I shall {{probably}} have to go the rounds of all the managers, but I {{am not going to}} stop till I have gone the rounds. I shall begin with the highest, and I sha'n't stop till <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> lowest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I shall {{go first}} to my aunt in London; and if she won't have me, I'll work for a living. I have left my father for ever! What I should have done if I had not met you I cannot tell--I must have walked {{all the way to}} London, I suppose. Now I shall take the train as soon as <b>I</b> <b>reach</b> <b>the</b> mainland.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Who {{was it that}} {{strove to}} bring me to the Red Death before <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> sanctuary? Who shot the {{poisoned}} arrow, Priest?" ...|$|R
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> deck, <b>I</b> saw {{no one but}} a {{large man}} in a large {{dripping}} pea-jacket, who was calking down the main-hatches.|$|R
60|$|That {{moment came}} quickly. The steamer {{was not a}} hundred feet from me when <b>I</b> <b>reached</b> <b>the</b> deck. It passed me on the port side.|$|R
