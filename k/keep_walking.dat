She said [...] "While Rock Bottom {{is mostly a}} goofy episode, it's {{also one of the}} scarier episodes of SpongeBob." [...] She also said the episode has [...] "the ideal balance of cuteness and sheer terror – like SpongeBob running from a mysterious character, saying, 'Well, that place will be there tomorrow. I guess I'd better <b>keep</b> <b>walking.</b> Running. Better start running. Running. Sprinting! Yes, I just gotta keep sprinting!' (Before he hits a wall; 'Sitting, sitting, bleeding.')" [...] that made the episode [...] "so well-remembered." [...] Bill Treadway of DVD Talk gave the episode a 3 out of 5 rating.|$|E

The picture has been crawling and stumbling along and then it climbs a high wire and walks it and <b>keeps</b> <b>walking</b> it until we're almost dizzy from admiration.

6000|$|Ghibba {{tried in}} vain to catch exactly what they meant by these signs, for they had no word to {{describe}} their meaning to him. But after he had patiently watched and listened, he said: [...] "I think, Mulla-mulgars, they mean that if we <b>keep</b> <b>walking</b> along these slippery high banks, one by one, we shall topple head over heels into the torrent, and be drowned--over like that," [...] he said, and traced with his finger an arch in the air.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, it isn't so much that," [...] {{returned}} the girl. [...] "You <b>keep</b> <b>walking</b> {{on and on}} because it's so smooth and straight before you. We've been here so often that we know it all by heart--just how it looks at high tide, and how it looks at low tide, and how it looks after a storm.

Well, doctor, I don't care who the man is, 'tis a mercy you wasn't a drownded, or a splintered, or a hanged up to a tree like Absalom--also a handsome gentleman like yerself, as the prophets say." ...|$|E

Once the whole formation has passed the pivot, aus (here, lit. on or ahead, thus straight ahead) lets it return to full step.|$|R

6000|$|... "The {{authorities}} are all right. She had disappeared {{with him before}} the others noticed. It was a thing that happened; there was no design in it; {{that would have been}} out of character. They had got {{to the end of the}} wood-road, and into the thick of the trees where there wasn't even a trail, and they walked round looking for a way out till they were turned completely. They decided that the only way was to <b>keep</b> <b>walking,</b> and by and by they heard the sound of chopping. It was some Canucks clearing a piece of the woods, and when she spoke to them in French they gave them full directions, and Braybridge soon found the path again." ...|$|E
6000|$|Allan {{picked up}} the flask of whisky lying on the deck near him, and revived his spirits with a dram.

[...] "Three o'clock!" [...] he went on, looking at his watch, and settling himself comfortably on deck with {{his back against the}} bulwark. [...] "Daybreak isn't far off; we shall have the piping of the birds to cheer us up before long. I say, Midwinter, you seem to have quite got over that unlucky fainting fit. How you do <b>keep</b> <b>walking!</b> Come here and have a cigar, and make yourself comfortable. What's the good of tramping backward and forward in that restless way?" ...|$|E
60|$|One old woman, between fifty and sixty, a sheer wreck, I {{had noticed}} {{earlier in the}} night {{standing}} in Piccadilly, not far from Leicester Square. She seemed to have neither the sense nor the strength {{to get out of}} the rain or <b>keep</b> <b>walking,</b> but stood stupidly, whenever she got the chance, meditating on past days, I imagine, when life was young and blood was warm. But she did not get the chance often. She was moved on by every policeman, and it required an average of six moves to send her doddering off one man's beat and on to another's. By three o'clock, she had progressed as far as St. James Street, and as the clocks were striking four I saw her sleeping soundly against the iron railings of Green Park. A brisk shower was falling at the time, and she must have been drenched to the skin.|$|E

Then it shows group of girls come to the same road, they hear a gun shot, not sure of what to do. Then they see a floating mask in the wind.|$|R
50|$|On 14 February 2013, being Valentine's Day, {{the poster}} {{of the album}} was {{released}}, in which a character, a boy, stands on a cloud with a guitar on his back, when hearts and raindrops pour from the sky. A promo song from the album was released on YouTube on February 24, 2013. The song Oh..Mazhaye (ஓ..மழையே) became a hit among the youth because of a very hummable tune, and more than 100 people shared it on Facebook {{on the first day}} itself. The video of the song is a 2D animation, where the boy (the character in the poster) <b>keeps</b> <b>walking</b> and playing the guitar, throughout the video.|$|R

60|$|The {{shops are}} now {{completely}} opened, and apprentices and shopmen are busily engaged in cleaning and decking the windows for the day. The bakers’ shops in town {{are filled with}} servants and children waiting for the drawing of the first batch of rolls—an operation which was performed a full hour ago in the suburbs: for the early clerk population of Somers and Camden towns, Islington, and Pentonville, are fast pouring into the city, or directing their steps towards Chancery-lane and the Inns of Court. Middle-aged men, whose salaries have by no means increased in the same proportion as their families, plod steadily along, apparently with no object in view but the counting-house; knowing by sight almost everybody they meet or overtake, for they have seen them every morning (Sunday excepted) during the last twenty years, but speaking to no one. If they do happen to overtake a personal acquaintance, they just exchange a hurried salutation, and <b>keep</b> <b>walking</b> on either by his side, or in front of him, as his rate of walking may chance to be. As to stopping to shake hands, or to take the friend’s arm, they {{seem to think that}} as it is not included in their salary, they have no right to do it. Small office lads in large hats, who are made men before they are boys, hurry along in pairs, with their first coat carefully brushed, and the white trousers of last Sunday plentifully besmeared with dust and ink. It evidently requires a considerable mental struggle to avoid investing part of the day’s dinner-money in the purchase of the stale tarts so temptingly exposed in dusty tins at the pastry-cooks’ doors; but a consciousness of their own importance and the receipt of seven shillings a-week, with the prospect of an early rise to eight, comes to their aid, and they accordingly put their hats a little more on one side, and look under the bonnets of all the milliners’ and stay-makers’ apprentices they meet—poor girls!—the hardest worked, the worst paid, and too often, the worst used class of the community.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after the}} man walks out of an alley and {{stands in front of}} the woman while she's walking down the street, {{although}} she ignores him and <b>keeps</b> <b>walking.</b> He gets her attention by shouting, and then begins singing [...] "The Way You Make Me Feel" [...] to her while also dancing. Uninterested, she walks away. He follows her, having been cheered on by his friends to pursue her. Another dance routine begins, involving the man's friends, which leads to the man pursuing the woman throughout the neighborhood. The video ends with the man eventually winning the woman over, and embracing her, while a fire hydrant sprays out water. The videoclip also features an appearance by his sister La Toya as one of Thumbtzen's friends.|$|R

Bobby has to persuade the dealer to give him the cocaine without the money, a very risky proposition as the dealer will kill him if he fails to bring the money back. However, walking away with the drugs, Bobby is intercepted by the two plainclothes cops. He quickly hides the yellow plastic bag in a trash barrel and <b>keeps</b> <b>walking.</b> The cops drive off after a couple of blocks, but when Bobby runs back to the trash barrel, the yellow bag is missing.|$|R
