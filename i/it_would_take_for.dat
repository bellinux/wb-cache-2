5|$|The program's {{producers}} and Brockman met {{to review the}} videotape. They noticed that Larson would immediately celebrate after many of his spins instead of waiting the {{fraction of a second}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> a contestant to see and respond to the space he or she had stopped on, effectively showing he {{knew he was going to}} get something good. It was also noticed that Larson had an unusual reaction to his early prize of a Kauai trip, which was out of his pattern – he initially looked puzzled and upset, but then recovered and celebrated after a pause.|$|E
5|$|The team {{entered the}} season {{surrounded}} by questions {{of how they}} would overcome the late season collapse from last year and what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year. On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon {{made it clear that}} he would do whatever was necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump.|$|E
5|$|In January 2008 China and Germany inaugurated {{a long-distance}} freight train service between Beijing and Hamburg. Travelling {{a total of}} , the train uses the China Railways and the Trans-Mongolian line to travel from Xiangtan (in Hunan Province) to Ulaanbaatar, where it then {{continues}} north to the Trans-Siberian. After reaching {{the end of the}} Trans-Siberian at Moscow the train continues to Germany via rail links in Belarus and Poland. Total transit time is 15 days, as compared with the 30 days average <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> the freight to make the same journey by ship. The first train of 50 containers, carrying a mixed load of clothes, ceramics and electronics (for the Fujitsu company), travelled on tracks operated by six different railways.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, Roland, who {{was legally}} blind, {{suffered}} a detached retina in his good eye {{and had to}} have immediate surgery to repair <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> years <b>for</b> him to recover and he never returned to the BBS scene.|$|R
50|$|Harald's army {{approached}} from three routes to the south. Harald lined his army up {{to oppose the}} Anglo-Saxons, but he knew <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> hours <b>for</b> all of his troops to arrive. His least experienced troops {{were sent to the}} right and his best troops on the riverbank.|$|R

25|$|In 2007 the IWC {{passed a}} {{resolution}} asking Japan to refrain from issuing a permit for lethal research in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary – the main Japanese whaling area. After a visit to Tokyo by {{the chairman of the}} IWC, asking the Japanese for their co-operation in sorting out the differences between pro- and anti-whaling nations on the Commission, the Japanese whaling fleet agreed that no humpback whales would be caught for the two years <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> the IWC to reach a formal agreement.|$|E
25|$|Parliament {{revised and}} {{expanded}} the Militia Ordinance, {{replacing it with}} the Militia Act 1858. Some of the main changes were clauses enabling volunteers to be included under such terms and conditions as the Governor may specify. The act also outlined the purposes under which Militia could be called upon, including invasion. Debates in Parliament had included expressions of concern about Russian naval expansion in the northern Pacific, {{pointed out that the}} sole naval defence consisted of one 24-gun frigate, and the time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> Britain to come to the colony's aid.|$|E
25|$|Andrade {{goes on to}} {{question}} whether or not Europeans would have developed large artillery pieces {{in the first place}} had they faced Chinese style walls so resistant to projectiles, coming to the conclusion that such exorbitant investments in weapons unable to serve their primary purpose would not have been ideal. Yet Chinese walls do not fully explain the divergence in gun development as European guns grew not only bigger, but more effective as well. By 1490 the European gun had achieved the basic form <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> the next three centuries, during which it would dominate the fields of warfare. The Classic Gun had arrived, and in the 1510s and 1520s when the Chinese encountered European firearms, they fully recognized they were superior to their own.|$|E
50|$|The sodium-potassium {{exchange}} pump {{is relatively}} slow in operation. If a cell were initialized with equal concentrations of sodium and potassium everywhere, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> hours <b>for</b> the pump to establish equilibrium. The pump operates constantly, but becomes progressively less efficient as {{the concentrations of}} sodium and potassium available for pumping are reduced.|$|R
25|$|A {{report in}} the Greeley Tribune says that over the five years <b>it</b> <b>would</b> {{typically}} <b>take</b> <b>for</b> a new car owner {{to pay off the}} vehicle cost differential, a hybrid Camry driver could save up to $6,700 in gasoline at current gasoline prices, with hybrid tax incentives as an additional saving.|$|R
50|$|Analysts {{believe that}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> years <b>for</b> {{the armed forces}} to make any {{significant}} progress in reducing the territory held by the armed groups, since the Uribe administration progress in this topic has progressed far beyond expectations, where at this point, FARC forces are in retreat plan to the jungles and are constantly attacked by the Colombian army.|$|R
25|$|In Norden's {{version of}} the system, the bombardier first looked up the {{expected}} time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> the bombs to fall from the current altitude. This time was set into a countdown stopwatch, and the bombardier waited for the target to line up {{with a set of}} iron sights {{at the front of the}} bombsight. When the target passed through the sights, the timer was started, and the bombardier then rotated the telescope around its vertical axis to track the target as they approached it. This movement was linked to a second sight through a gearing system that caused the second to move twice as fast as the first. The bombardier continued moving the telescope until the timer ran out. The second sight was now at the correct aiming angle, or range angle; the bombardier moved his eyes to look through this second set of sights to time the drop.|$|E
25|$|Blow flies {{are usually}} the first insects to colonize a body, {{frequently}} within minutes after death. P. regina adults and larvae are attracted to the body because, during decomposition, the remains go through rapid physical, biological, and chemical changes. If a corpse is found, {{the early stages of}} dipterans present may be used in determining the PMI by reverse estimation of the time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> eggs to have been deposited and larvae to have developed to the stage they were collected, while taking into account environmental factors. The use of maggot age and development can give a date of death accurate to a day or less, and is used in the first few weeks after death. Blow flies will lay their eggs on the corpse, usually in a wound, if present, or in any of the natural orifices. Therefore, after a single blow fly generation has been completed, the time of death is determined using the first method, that of insect succession.|$|E
500|$|At about 8:45a.m., {{satisfied}} at {{the weakness}} in the enemy centre, Napoleon asked Soult how long <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> his men to reach the Pratzen Heights, to which the Marshal replied, [...] "Less than twenty minutes, sire." [...] About 15 minutes later, Napoleon ordered the attack, adding, [...] "One sharp blow and the war is over." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{estimate}} {{of how long}} <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> the fleet to reach Singapore after the outbreak of hostilities varied. It had to include {{the time required to}} assemble the fleet, prepare and provision its ships, and then [...] sally to Singapore. Initially, the estimate was 42 days, assuming reasonable advance warning. In 1938, it was increased to 70 days, with 14 more for reprovisioning. It was further increased in June 1939 to 90 days plus 15 for reprovisioning, and finally, in September 1939, to 180 days.|$|E
500|$|Historically, the Colorado transported from [...] of {{sediment}} or silt to the Gulf of California each year – {{second only to}} the Mississippi among North American rivers. This sediment nourished wetlands and riparian areas along the river's lower course, particularly in its [...] delta, once the largest desert estuary on the continent. Currently, the majority {{of sediment}}s carried by the Colorado River are deposited at the upper end of Lake Powell, and most of the remainder ends up in Lake Mead. Various estimates place the time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> Powell to completely fill with silt at 300 to 700 years. Dams trapping sediment not only pose damage to river habitat but also threaten future operations of the Colorado River reservoir system.|$|E
500|$|In 2001, R. Ernesto Blanco and Mazzetta {{evaluated}} the cursorial (running) capability of Giganotosaurus. They rejected the hypothesis by James Orville Farlow {{that the risk}} of injuries involved in such large animals falling while on a run, would limit the speed of large theropods. Instead they posed that the imbalance caused by increasing velocity would be the limiting factor. Calculating the time <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> a leg to gain balance after the retraction of the opposite leg, they found the upper kinematic limit of the running speed to be [...] They also found comparison between the running capability of Giganotosaurus and birds like the ostrich based on the strength of their leg-bones to be of limited value, since theropods, unlike birds, had heavy tails to counterbalance their weight.|$|E

50|$|The Reform Edicts {{severely}} curtailed {{the independence}} of regional officials and constituted the imperial court {{as a place of}} appeal and complaint about the people. In addition, the last edicts attempted to end certain social practices, in order to bring Japanese society more in line with Chinese social practices. Nonetheless, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> centuries <b>for</b> the conceptual idea of the Chinese-style emperor to take root in Japan.|$|R
5000|$|Snowshoe had {{originally}} been envisioned as a four season destination, although <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> years <b>for</b> mountain bike and horseback riding trails to become a significant draw. One key advantage for the mountain has continued to be its lower temperatures, due to its elevation. With a mean temperature of [...] in January and [...] in July, Snowshoe can be considerably cooler than nearby areas at lower elevations.|$|R
500|$|In 1961, Leader of the Opposition Lester Pearson asked John Ross Matheson {{to begin}} researching what <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> Canada {{to have a}} new flag. Pearson knew the Red Ensign with the Union Jack was unpopular in Quebec, a base of support for his Liberal Party, but {{strongly}} favoured by English Canada. By April 1963, Pearson was prime minister in a minority government and risked losing power over the issue. He formed a 15-member multi-party parliamentary committee in 1963 to select a new design, despite opposition leader Diefenbaker's demands for a referendum on the issue. On May 27, 1964, Pearson's cabinet introduced a motion to parliament for adoption of his favourite design, presented to him by artist and heraldic advisor Alan Beddoe, of a [...] "sea to sea" [...] (Canada's motto) flag with blue borders and three conjoined red maple leaves on a white field. This motion led to weeks of acrimonious debate in the House of Commons and the design {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Pearson Pennant", derided by the media and viewed as a [...] "concession to Québec".|$|E

5000|$|Inflationary pressures: It {{follows from}} the neglect of the {{agricultural}} sector that food shortages are likely to occur with industrialization. Though <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> time <b>for</b> investments in social overhead capital to yield returns, the demand would increase immediately, thus imposing inflationary pressures on the economy. Cost escalations may even cause projects to be postponed and the development process in general to slow down.|$|R

2500|$|Modern astronomers {{define the}} {{tropical}} year as {{time for the}} Sun's mean longitude to increase by 360°. The process for finding an expression {{for the length of}} the tropical year is to first find an expression for the Sun's mean longitude (with respect to ♈), such as Newcomb's expression given above, or Laskar's expression (1986, p.64). When viewed over a one-year period, the mean longitude is very nearly a linear function of Terrestrial Time. To find the length of the tropical year, the mean longitude is differentiated, to give the angular speed of the Sun as a function of Terrestrial Time, and this angular speed is used to compute how long <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>take</b> <b>for</b> the Sun to move 360° ( [...] ; Astronomical Almanac for the year 2011, L8).|$|E
