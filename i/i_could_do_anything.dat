500|$|Following {{the release}} of The Wraith: Shangri-La, Bruce {{admitted}} that he was considering not completing the production of Hell's Pit. He is quoted as describing Shangri-La as [...] "{{the end of the}} road. It's the end of the Joker's Cards. After this <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> I want, {{for the rest of my}} life. The positivity was so unbelievable". On August 31, 2004, Insane Clown Posse released their ninth studio album, Hell's Pit, the second exhibit of The Wraith, intended to warn listeners of the horrors of Hell. Bruce described the album as the darkest, most painful work he had ever done. Two versions of the album were released, each containing a different DVD. One release featured a live concert and a twelve-minute music video for the song [...] "Real Underground Baby", and another featured a short film for the song [...] "Bowling Balls", which was the first 3-D film shot in high-definition video. In 2005, D12 and Insane Clown Posse ended their feud, with the help of member Proof. Attempts to officially end the feud between Eminem and Insane Clown Posse have been unsuccessful, but Bruce states that the rivalry has ended.|$|E
500|$|Each main {{cast member}} auditioned for Friends having had {{some degree of}} prior sitcom experience. Before finally being cast in Friends, Cox's burgeoning success as an actress had heavily relied on her {{physical}} appearance. Unlike her previous roles in projects such as Family Ties and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective, the Los Angeles Times Steve Weinstein believes that Monica {{was the first major}} role in which Cox was cast based on her abilities as a comedic actress as opposed to her beauty. Cox believes that she owes winning the role to her brief stint as Gabriella Easden on the short-lived sitcom The Trouble With Larry, which she considers to be the first time she played a character who [...] "was the funny one", which in turn earned the actress a recommendation for Friends following its cancellation. When Friends premiered, Cox was the show's most famous main cast member among a cast of young, relatively unknown actors, and was thus initially perceived by critics and audiences as the show's star, despite Crane and Kauffman's efforts to promote Friends as an ensemble comedy. According to actress Lisa Kudrow, who portrays Phoebe, Cox is responsible for suggesting that the entire cast work together as a team. As the most experienced cast member at the time, Cox advised her co-stars to remain open to each other's ideas, notes and suggestions, while giving them permission to tell her [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> funnier". Cox was originally the highest-paid cast member. Preferring to be treated as equals, the entire cast negotiated for universal salaries, demanding that Warner Bros. accommodate their request of $100,000 per episode in season three, increased from their original inaugural season salary of $22,000 per episode. At one point, the actors went as far as threatening to boycott their own show should their demands be denied, temporarily refusing to renew their expired contracts. The studio eventually complied, and by season 10 each actor was being paid $1 million per episode, making Cox and her female co-stars the highest-paid television actresses of all time.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2006 interview, Cornell {{revealed}} {{that at the}} age of 14, he had a bad PCP experience and suffered from panic disorder and agoraphobia. [...] "I had a bad PCP [...] experience when I was 14 and I got panic disorder. And of course, I wasn't telling anyone the truth. It's not like you go to your dad or your doctor and say, 'Yeah, I smoked PCP and I'm having a bad time.' So I became more or less agoraphobic because I'd have flashbacks. From 14 to 16, I didn't have any friends. I stayed home most of the time. Up till then life was pretty great. The world was big and I felt <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> I wanted. Suddenly, I felt like I couldn't do anything. But in the isolation, my imagination really had time to run. I never did any drugs until my late 20s. Unfortunately, being a child of two alcoholics, I started drinking a lot, and that's what eventually got me back into drugs. You often hear that pot leads to harder drugs. But I think alcohol is what leads you to everything, because it takes away the fear. The worst drug experimentation I ever did was because I was drunk and didn't care." ...|$|E
