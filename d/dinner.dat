5|$|In 1992, {{during its}} time under the {{ownership}} of Britain-based Grand Metropolitan, Burger King experimented with table service. After 4pm, customers would place their order at the counter, and their order would be brought to them at their table. Customers were given complimentary popcorn to eat while waiting for their meal. To coincide with the offering, a series of meals called the <b>Dinner</b> baskets were introduced. The <b>dinner</b> baskets included the Whopper <b>Dinner</b> Basket, Steak Sandwich <b>Dinner</b> Basket, Fried Chicken <b>Dinner</b> Basket, and Shrimp <b>Dinner</b> Basket. In the New England region of the United States, BK sold a Fried clam Basket. The <b>dinner</b> came with two sides, including a choice of a side salad, cole slaw, French fries, or baked potato. Lasting approximately a year, the sit-down restaurant concept was abandoned in 1994 {{in favor of the}} original quick-service formula.|$|E

40|$|Background: Food-based dietary {{guidelines}} often recommend increased {{consumption of}} fish and reduced intake of red and processed meat. However, {{little is known about}} how changing the main protein source from red meat to fish may influence the choice of side dishes. Objective: To investigate whether side dish choices differed between red meat and fish <b>dinners.</b> Moreover, to compare intakes of macronutrients and selected micronutrients in red meat and fish <b>dinners</b> and to see whether whole-day intakes of these nutrients differed between days with red meat <b>dinners</b> and days with fish <b>dinners.</b> Design: Data were collected in a cross-sectional nationwide Norwegian dietary survey using two non-consecutive telephone-administered 24 -h recalls. The recalls were conducted approximately 4 weeks apart. In total, 2, 277 <b>dinners</b> from 1, 517 participants aged 18 – 70 were included in the analyses. Results: Fish <b>dinners</b> were more likely to include potatoes and carrots than red meat <b>dinners,</b> whereas red meat <b>dinners</b> more often contained bread, tomato sauce, and cheese. Red meat <b>dinners</b> contained more energy and iron; had higher percentages of energy (E%) from fat, saturated fat, and monounsaturated fat; and a lower E% from protein and polyunsaturated fat than fish <b>dinners.</b> Fish <b>dinners</b> contained more vitamin D, β-carotene, and folate than red meat <b>dinners.</b> Similar differences were found when comparing whole-day intakes of the same nutrients on days with red meat versus fish <b>dinners.</b> Conclusion: Fish <b>dinners</b> were accompanied by different side dishes than red meat <b>dinners.</b> With regard to nutrient content, fish <b>dinners</b> generally had a healthier profile than red meat <b>dinners.</b> However, iron intake was higher for red meat <b>dinners.</b> Information about associated foods will be useful both for developing public health guidelines and when studying associations between dietary factors and health outcomes...|$|R

25|$|Islam's holiest month, Ramadan, is {{observed}} through many events. As Muslims must fast {{during the day}} during Ramadan, mosques will host iftar <b>dinners</b> after sunset and the fourth required prayer of the day, maghrib. Food is provided, at least in part, {{by members of the}} community, thereby creating daily potluck <b>dinners.</b> Because of the community contribution necessary to serve iftar <b>dinners,</b> mosques with smaller congregations {{may not be able to}} host the iftar <b>dinners</b> daily. Some mosques will also hold suhoor meals before dawn to congregants attending the first required prayer of the day, fajr. As with iftar <b>dinners,</b> congregants usually provide the food for suhoor, although able mosques may provide food instead. Mosques will often invite poorer members of the Muslim community to share in beginning and breaking the fasts, as providing charity during Ramadan is regarded in Islam as especially honorable.|$|R
