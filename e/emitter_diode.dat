40|$|Nowadays {{conventional}} power pin-diodes {{have reached a}} mature development level in which no essential improvements can be expected. To drastically improve on state and switching properties, new design concepts are needed. Some solutions {{can be found in}} the literature. However, they show severe disadvantages from the chip fabrication and applicationpoint of view. New design concepts for silicon diodes with a blocking voltage larger than 2 - 3 kV arepresented in this work. Using an additional gate signal terminal, the emitter efficiency of the p-emitter can be controlled, resulting in a state dependent suitable on-state and turn off bahaviour. The diode is therefore called <b>Emitter</b> Controlled <b>Diode</b> = ECD. Additional advantages are the blocking capability under all operating conditions compared to otherdesign concepts, good turn off characteristics even under critical switching conditions and apositive temperature coefficient.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study on}} the use of low temperature co-fired ceramic (LTCC) material as a new platform for the packaging of multiple broad area single <b>emitter</b> <b>diode</b> lasers. This will address the recent trend in the laser industry of combining multiple laser diodes in a common package to reach the beam brightness and power required for pumping fibre lasers and for direct-diode industrial applications, such as welding, cutting, and etching. Packages based on multiple single emitters offer advantages over those derived from monolithic diode bars such as higher brightness, negligible thermal crosstalk between neighbouring emitters and protection against cascading failed emitters. In addition, insulated sub-mounted laser diodes based on telecommunication standards are preferred to diode bars and stacks because of the degree of assembly automation, and improved lifetime. At present, lasers are packaged on Cu or CuW platforms, whose high thermal conductivities allow an efficient passive cooling. However, as the number of emitters per package increases and improvements in the laser technology enable higher output power, the passive cooling will become insufficient. To overcome this problem, a LTCC platform capable of actively removing the heat generated by the lasers through impingement jet cooling was developed. It was provided with an internal water manifold capable to impinge water at 0. 15 lmin- 1 flow rate on the back surface of each laser with a variation of less than 2 °C in the temperature between the diodes. The thermal impedance of 2. 7 °C/W obtained allows the LTCC structure to cool the latest commercial broad area single <b>emitter</b> <b>diode</b> lasers which deliver up to 13 W of optical power. Commonly, the emitters are placed in a “staircase” formation to stack the emitters in the fast-axis, maintaining the brightness of the diode lasers. However, due to technical difficulties of machining the LTCC structure with a staircase-shaped face, a novel out-plane beam shaping method was proposed to obtain an elegant and compact free space combination of the laser beam on board using inexpensive optics. A compact arrangement was obtained using aligned folding mirrors, which stacked the beams {{on top of each other}} in the fast direction with the minimum dead space...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNT) {{have been}} proposed for many electronic applications, such as field <b>emitter,</b> <b>diode,</b> transistors, integrated circuit interconnections and thermal interface material (TIM). The growth temperature of high quality CNT typically takes place at high temperatures. The high growth temperature causes significant difficulty in the integration of CNT to the many common material used in electronics, such as, metal, glasses and most polymers. We prepare the high-density aligned CNT film on the silicon/silicon dioxide substrate using a plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) method. The aligned CNT film is kept intact after the supporting silicon dioxide layer is removed by hydrofluoric acid (HF) solution. The "lifted off " CNT film can be transferred to various substrates at room temperature. This method avoids the problem caused by the high temperature process, and retains the CNT film quality. Thermal characterization indicates that {{the resistance of the}} transferred CNT film is comparable with that of as-grown CNT film.

40|$|Various models using radiometric {{approach}} {{have been}} proposed {{to solve the problem}} of estimating the distance between a camera and an infrared <b>emitter</b> <b>diode</b> (IRED).

This paper proposes an alternative approach to remove temperature drift in the distance estimation method by eliminating the dependence on radiant intensity. The main aim was to use the relative accumulated energy together with other defined models, such as the zeroth-frequency component of the FFT of the IRED image and the standard deviation of pixel gray level intensities in the region of interest containing the IRED image. By using the abovementioned models, an expression free of IRED radiant intensity was obtained. Furthermore, the final model permitted simultaneous estimation of the distance between the IRED and the camera and the IRED orientation angle.

Selective Laser Melting (SLM) comprises of either a single or multiple deflected high energy fibre laser source(s) to raster scan, melt and fuse layers of metallic powdered feedstock. However this deflected laser raster scanning methodology is high cost, energy inefficient and encounters significant limitations on output productivity due to the rate of feedstock melting.

40|$|Fulltext: Currently the {{widespread}} application of fs-lasers {{is limited by}} price and complexity. One approach for userfriendly systems are diode-pumped Kerr-lens mode-locked (KLM) fs-lasers with Cr:LiSGaF or Cr:LiSAF as the gain-medium. However bulky optical systems are necessary, to focus the laser diodes through the folding mirrors of a standard x- or z-fold cavity into the crystal. Efficient KLM and a small lasing threshold requires to focus the resonator mode tightly into the laser crystal. But {{in this case the}} poor beam quality of available red single <b>emitter</b> <b>diode</b> lasers prohibits an efficient mode matching To overcome these problems we designed the very asymmetric resonator in Fig. 1 and optimized it for high self amplitude modulation (SAM). With this setup and very compact optics for the beam shaping and polarization combination of the diodes we achieve efficient mode matching in the 5 mm long Cr:LiSGaF-crystal at a moderate lasing threshold. The 4 mm thick SF 57 disk between a p air of folding mirrors with a ROC of 75 mm permits a very high SAM and self phase modulation (SPM). To compensate its group velocity dispersion (GVD) of 1920 fs 2 first used SF 10 prisms at 425 mm separation With a 2 per cent output-coupler and 660 mW power at the laser-crystal we achieved stable, nearly transform limited pulses centered at 837 nm of 68 fs duration, 56 mW average power and 100 MHz repetition rate. The laser was clearly soft aperture mode-locking, because we calculated, that only an aperture inside the laser-crystal or the SF 57 plate provides the necessary nonlinear loss modulation. To avoid a strong sideband in the mode-locked spectrum, we replaced the SF 10 prisms by a pair of LAK 31 prisms 865 mm apart. This reduced the calculated net third order dispersion (TOD) from - 11000 fs 3 to - 2800 fs 3, and with an 1 per cent output-coupler we achieved 34 fs pulses of 11 mW average power (Fig. 2). We measured a net GVD of - 130 fs 2 by the position of a sideband appearing at a lower amount of negative net GVD'. Despite the low intracavity power caused by resonator losses of 2 per cent, mode-locking is self-starting after running some 100 ms in continuos wave. The signal of a photodiode in Fig. 3 shows the change from continuos wave to mode-locking. Increasing SAM in relation to SPM by a more symmetric oscillator can reduce the tendency to generate sidebands' at a lower amount of net GVD and yield shorter pulses. However the beam diameter in the laser crystal and hence the lasing threshold rises with increasing symmetry. An improved surface finish of the SF 57 disc and the prisms will decrease optical loss and reduce threshold. Pumping with a fiber-coupled high power diodebar will lead to larger tolerable values of the lasing threshold...|$|E

The micro-fluidic device employed a photoswitchable micro-valve, controlled by white light and generated using a light emitting diode. This low-cost and low-power detector exhibited very low limits of detection (34 ± 0. 1 μg L- 1). Freshwater samples were analysed and the results were compared to those generated with a conventional UV-Vis spectrophotometer showing good agreement. The suitability of the analyser for the precise and continuous measurement of samples was established. In addition, its small size and low weight offered the advantage of portability, while its data logging capabilities allowed for independent nitrite monitoring. Moreover, integration of a wireless communication device allowed for the instrument to be controlled and results to be downloaded remotely...|$|R
