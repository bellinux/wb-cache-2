5|$|Krishna {{is often}} {{depicted}} wearing a peacock-feather wreath or crown, {{and playing the}} bansuri (Indian flute). In this form, he is usually shown standing with one leg bent in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in the Tribhanga posture. He is sometimes accompanied by cows or a calf, which symbolise the divine herdsman Govinda. Alternatively, he is shown as a romantic and seductive man with the gopis (milkmaids), often making music or playing pranks.|$|E
5|$|A bicycle kick, {{also known}} as an {{overhead}} kick or scissors kick, is a physical move in association football. It is achieved by throwing the body backward up into the air, making a shearing movement with the lower limbs to get one leg in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> in order to strike an airborne ball rearwards above head level, without resting on the ground. In most languages, the manoeuvre is named after either the cycling motion or the scissor motion that it resembles. Its complexity, and uncommon performance in competitive football matches, makes it one of association football's most celebrated skills.|$|E
5|$|Antlia is a faint constellation; its {{brightest}} star is Alpha Antliae, an orange giant {{that is a}} suspected variable star, ranging between apparent magnitudes 4.22 and 4.29. S Antliae is an eclipsing binary star system, changing in brightness as one star passes in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> Sharing a common envelope, the stars are so close they will one day merge to form a single star. Two star systems with known exoplanets, HD 93083 and WASP-66, lie within Antlia, as do NGC 2997, a spiral galaxy, and the Antlia Dwarf Galaxy.|$|E

5|$|Capella A {{consists}} of two yellow evolved stars that have been calculated to orbit each other every 104 days with a separation of around 100 million km. The pair is a non-eclipsing binary—that is, as seen from Earth, neither star passes in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The orbit is known extremely accurately {{and can be used}} to derive an orbital parallax with far better precision than the one measured directly. The stars are not near enough to each other for the Roche lobe of either star to have been filled and any significant mass transfer to have taken place, even during the red giant stage of the primary star.|$|E
5|$|Eclipsing {{variables}} are star systems that vary in brightness {{because of one}} star passing in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum {{of the system is}} A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.|$|E
5|$|This corvid {{is known}} to join mixed-species flocks with other species {{including}} unicolored jays and emerald toucanets. It is also known to travel in groups with two to ten other azure-hooded jays. It is a skulking and secretive species, rarely coming out into the open. Because of this habit, the bird {{is extremely difficult to}} observe in the wild and not much is known about its ecology. Mates are known to preen each other, a process which entails one bird bending over in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> and tugging on its throat feathers. The feathers of the crown are often moving swiftly, and it is believed that the condition of a mate can be determined by this movement.|$|E

5|$|Gee (Yaphet Kotto) tells Pembleton (Andre Braugher), an {{excellent}} detective but a lone wolf, {{that he must}} work with a partner. Pembleton ends up investigating {{the death of a}} 65-year-old man with rookie detective Bayliss (Kyle Secor). Bayliss initially believes the death to be a heart attack, but Pembleton correctly determines it is a murder because the man's car is missing. Police later arrest a man named Johnny (Alexander Chaplin) who is found driving the dead man's car. During an interrogation, Pembleton fools Johnny into waiving his Miranda Rights, then sneakily persuades him into confessing to the murder. Bayliss, although convinced of Johnny's guilt, nevertheless questions the ethics of Pembleton's approach, prompting Pembleton to yell angrily at him in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> officers. The episode ends with Bayliss responding to his first homicide as the primary detective: the brutal murder of an 11-year-old girl named Adena Watson.|$|E

5|$|Jack Broughton, {{a celebrated}} boxing {{champion}} (and another {{who was also}} a swordsman), had gone some way to defining the rules of prizefighting in 1743, based on earlier work by Figg, but by Johnson's time the rules were still interpreted very loosely. The style of fighting was also very different from modern boxing; the contestants stood facing each other squarely with their feet in line and their fists raised level in front of them, rather than the present-day stance of generally having one foot slightly in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> and one fist leading. Brute strength was the primary factor for success and knock-downs were frequent, a consequence of the instability inherent in the positioning of the fighters' feet. Rounds were not timed but instead lasted until a man was knocked down, with fighters permitted to wrestle each other to the ground. Moving around the ring, known as shifting, was deprecated and sometimes explicitly prohibited by the rules for a fight; going to ground without being hit could lead to claims that the man still standing had won. The fighters usually each provided an umpire of their choice, and there might also be a third, independent umpire present, to adjudicate between them.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim is to}} land on, or ideally surpass, a line marked {{across the}} hill called the 'K-point', 'critical point', or 'calculation line'. In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead of landing with simply both feet together (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> (without sliding the skis), both feet held {{no more than four}} ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose must be maintained until the 'outrun' – a line {{at the very end of}} the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement of landing is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a Telemark landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins to flatten out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a Telemark landing.|$|E
5|$|To keep low {{frequency}} sound {{focused on the}} audience area {{and not on the}} stage, and to keep low frequencies from bothering people outside of the event space, a variety of techniques have been developed in concert sound to turn the naturally omnidirectional radiation of subwoofers into a more directional pattern. Several examples of sound reinforcement system applications where sound engineers seek to provide more directional bass sound are music festivals, which often have several bands performing at the same time on different stages; large raves or EDM events, where there are multiple DJs performing {{at the same time in}} different rooms or stages; and multiplex movie theatres, in which there are many films being shown simultaneously in auditoriums that share common walls. These techniques include setting up subwoofers in a vertical array; using combinations of delay and polarity inversion; and setting up a delay-shaded system. With a cardioid dispersion pattern, two end-fire subwoofers can be placed one in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other.</b> The enclosure nearest the listener is delayed by a few milliseconds The second subwoofer is delayed a precise amount corresponding to the time it takes sound to traverse the distance between speaker grilles.|$|E

5|$|When the Indian flag is flown on Indian {{territory}} {{along with}} other national flags, the general rule is that the Indian flag should be {{the starting point of}} all flags. When flags are placed in a straight line, the rightmost flag (leftmost to the observer facing the flag) is the Indian flag, followed by other national flags in alphabetical order. When placed in a circle, the Indian flag is the first point and is followed by other flags alphabetically. In such placement, all other flags should be of approximately the same size with no other flag being larger than the Indian flag. Each national flag should also be flown from its own pole and no flag should be placed higher than another. In addition to being the first flag, the Indian flag may also be placed within the row or circle alphabetically. When placed on crossed poles, the Indian flag should be in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> flag, and to the right (observer's left) of the other flag. The only exception to the preceding rule is when it is flown along with the flag of the United Nations, which may be placed {{to the right of the}} Indian flag.|$|E
5|$|With every {{subsequent}} improvement made to {{the ground}} since the Second World War, the capacity steadily declined. By the 1980s, the capacity had dropped from the original 80,000 to approximately 60,000. The capacity dropped still further in 1990, when the Taylor Report recommended, and the government demanded that all First and Second Division stadia be converted to all-seaters. This meant that £3–5million plans to replace the Stretford End with a brand new stand with an all-standing terrace at the front and a cantilever roof to link {{with the rest of}} the ground had to be drastically altered. This forced redevelopment, including the removal of the terraces at the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> three stands, not only increased the cost to around £10million, but also reduced the capacity of Old Trafford to an all-time low of around 44,000. In addition, the club was told in 1992 that they would only receive £1.4million of a possible £2million from the Football Trust to be put towards work related to the Taylor Report.|$|E
5|$|Within Singapore, the {{national}} flag {{takes precedence over}} all other flags, subject to international practice. As such, when it is displayed or flown with other flags, it must {{be in a position}} of honour; that is, it should be positioned, where practical, either above all other flags or, if displayed side by side with other flags on the same level, {{to the left of the}} other flags (as seen by a person facing the flags). When the flag is raised or carried in a procession with other flags, it must be done so in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>other</b> flags in a single file, or on the right as seen by the standard bearers if the flags are carried side by side (i.e., on the left as seen by the viewer). The standard bearer must carry the flag high on his or her right shoulder.|$|E

40|$|An {{efficient}} {{approach for}} organizing large ad hoc networks is {{to divide the}} nodes into multiple clusters and designate, for each cluster, a clusterhead {{which is responsible for}} holding intercluster control information. <b>The</b> role <b>of</b> a clusterhead entails rights and duties.

But on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, <b>the</b> clusterhead role also has some associated costs. Hence, in order to prevent malicious nodes from taking control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group in a fraudulent way and avoid selfish attacks from suitable nodes, the clusterhead needs to be elected in a secure way.
