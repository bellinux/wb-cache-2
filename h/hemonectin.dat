40|$|Mutant Sl/Sld mice exhibit {{decreased}} marrow hematopoiesis. The defect {{is known}} to reside in the marrow microenvironment of these animals, which is reproduced in vitro by primary marrow explants {{as well as by}} cloned marrow stromal cell lines. Bone marrow progenitor cells are incapable of adhering to primary Sl/Sld stromal cells or cloned stromal cell lines derived from them to form cobblestone-islands and proliferate. The role of <b>hemonectin,</b> a marrow-specific adhesion protein in the defective hematopoiesis of the Sl/Sld mice, was studied. Indirect immunoperoxidase staining of marrow in situ from Sl/Sld mice showed little specific staining while specific staining was seen in a pericellular distribution in marrow from +/+ mice. <b>Hemonectin</b> expression in several cloned stromal cell lines from Sl/Sld mice was compared by immunoblotting with that in cloned stromal cell lines from normal +/+ littermates. Cell line Sld 3, which has the least hematopoiesis supportive capacity in vitro, showed no detectable <b>hemonectin</b> by immunoblotting, while Sld 1 and Sld 2 showed detectable but greatly reduced amounts compared with normal +/+ 2. 4, GBI/ 6, and D 2 XRII. Confluent cultures incubated with purified <b>hemonectin</b> and engrafted with enriched progenitors showed {{a significant increase in the}} cumulative number of cobbleston-islands and day 14 spleen colony-forming units (CFU-s) forming progenitors (39. 15 +/- 3. 6 /dish; 16. 3 +/- 3. 1 /dish, respectively), compared with untreated Sld 3 cultures (cobblestone-islands 8. 1 +/- 3. 6 /dish; CFU-s forming progenitors 8. 8 +/- 0. 05 /dish). Hemonectin-mediated progenitor cell binding to the Sld 3 stromal cells was specifically inhibited by antihemonectin but not by preimmune serum. These data support the role of <b>hemonectin</b> in early progenitor-stromal cell interactions...|$|E
