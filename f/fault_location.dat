40|$|Firewalls are the {{mainstay}} of enterprise security and the most widely adopted technology for protecting private networks. Ensuring the correctness of firewall policies through testing is important. In firewall policy testing, test inputs are packets and test outputs are decisions. Packets with unexpected (expected) evaluated decisions are classified as failed (passed) tests. Given failed tests together with passed tests, policy testers need to debug the policy to detect <b>fault</b> <b>locations</b> (such as faulty rules). Such a process is often time-consuming. To help reduce effort on detecting <b>fault</b> <b>locations,</b> we propose an approach {{to reduce the number}} of rules for inspection based on information collected during evaluating failed tests. Our approach ranks the reduced rules to decide which rules should be inspected first. We performed experiments on applying our approach. The empirical results show that our approach can reduce 56 % of rules that are required for inspection in fault localization. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a new robust linear {{decentralized}} controller {{is proposed}} {{to enhance the}} transient stability of nonlinear niultiniachine power systems. Only local measurements are required in the proposed controller. The feedback gain of each generator is obtained by solving an algebraic Riccati equation based on the bounds of the machine parameters. The stability analysis shows that the decentralized controller can guarantee the system stability over the whole operating region and regardless of <b>fault</b> <b>locations</b> or parameter uncertainties of the transmission network. Compared with nonlinear controllers, linear controllers are of simpler structure and easier to be implemented. A threemachine power system is considered as an application example. Simulation results show that despite the interconnections between different generators, nonlinearities in the system, different operating points, and different <b>fault</b> <b>locations,</b> the proposed robust decentralized controller can greatly enhance power system transient stability. © 1998 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

To enhance the identification accuracy, these features after normalization are given to AI algorithms for presenting and evaluating in this paper. Different AI techniques are then utilized to compare which identification algorithms are suitable to diagnose the SLGF for various power signatures in a NIFM system.
