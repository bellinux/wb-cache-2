25|$|The primary urge {{to breathe}} is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized {{and it needs to}} be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called hypocapnia. Hypocapnia reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people the first sign of low oxygen levels is a <b>greyout</b> or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.|$|E
5000|$|Curiosity in {{experiencing}} {{an altered}} state of consciousness, {{the experience of}} a <b>greyout,</b> or an imagined approximation to a near-death experience.|$|E
50|$|Usually {{recovery}} is rapid and a <b>greyout</b> {{can be readily}} reversed by lying down. This way, the cardiovascular system {{does not need to}} work against gravity for blood to reach the brain.|$|E
50|$|Another common {{occurrence}} of <b>greyouts</b> is in roller coaster riders. Many roller coasters put riders through positive g-forces, particularly in vertical loops and helixes. Roller coasters rarely have high enough negative g-forces to induce redouts, as most low-g elements {{are designed to}} simulate weightlessness.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} leader election in virtual traffic lights. A virtual traffic light (VTL) is a self-organizing traffic control system that allows road vehicles equipped with vehicle-to-vehicle communication facilities to implement the function of a traffic light {{without the support of}} a roadside installation. Previous research has shown {{that it is impossible to}} construct a leader election protocol that guarantees agreement among the participating vehicles in the presence of massive communication failures. The paper {{addresses the}} problem of calculating the probability of disagreement in situations where a large number of protocol messages are lost due to communication interference, so-called communication <b>greyouts.</b> To this end, we present a probabilistic analysis of a family of simple round-based consensus algorithms that solve the 1 - of-n selection problem. We propose to use these algorithms for the core logic of a VTL leader election protocol (LEP). Our analysis shows that the probability of disagreement depends on: i) the number of vehicles involved in the leader election, ii) the number of rounds of message exchange, iii) the probability of message loss, and iv) the decision criterion used by the LEP. We propose an optimistic and a pessimistic decision criteria for the proposed 1 -of-n selection algorithms. The analysis encompass two probabilistic failure models, one for symmetric communication failures and one for asymmetric communication failures...|$|R
50|$|A <b>greyout</b> (US English grayout) is a {{transient}} {{loss of vision}} characterized by a perceived dimming of light and color, sometimes accompanied by a loss of peripheral vision. It is a precursor to fainting or a blackout and is caused by hypoxia (low brain oxygen level), often due {{to a loss of}} blood pressure.|$|E
50|$|A redout {{occurs when}} the body {{experiences}} a negative g-force sufficient to cause a blood flow from the lower {{parts of the body}} to the head. It is the inverse effect of a <b>greyout,</b> where blood flows away from the head to the lower parts of the body. Usually, a redout will only ever be experienced by pilots, as planes are the most common devices that allow such negative g-forces to be exerted. Redouts are potentially dangerous and can cause retinal damage and hemorrhagic stroke.|$|E

50|$|A grey-out may be {{experienced}} by aircraft pilots pulling high positive g-forces as when pulling {{up into a}} loop or a tight turn forcing blood to the lower extremities {{of the body and}} lowering blood pressure in the brain. This is the reverse of a redout, or a reddening of the vision, which is the result of negative g-forces caused by performing an outside loop, that is by pushing the nose of the aircraft down. Redouts are potentially dangerous and can cause retinal damage and hemorrhagic stroke. Pilots of high performance aircraft can increase their resistance to <b>greyout</b> by using a g-suit, which controls the pooling of blood in the lower limbs but there is no suit yet capable of controlling a redout. In both cases symptoms may be remedied immediately by easing pressure on the flight controls. Continued, or heavy g-force will rapidly progress to g-LOC (g-force induced Loss of Consciousness).|$|E
50|$|If {{blood is}} allowed to pool in the lower areas of the body, the brain will be {{deprived}} of blood, leading to temporary hypoxia. Hypoxia first causes a <b>greyout</b> (a dimming of the vision), also called brownout, followed by tunnel vision and ultimately complete loss of vision 'blackout' followed by g-induced Loss Of Consciousness or 'g-LOC'. The danger of g-LOC to aircraft pilots is magnified because on relaxation of g there {{is a period of}} disorientation before full sensation is re-gained.A g-suit does not so much increase the g-threshold, but makes it possible to sustain high g longer without excessive physical fatigue. The resting g-tolerance of a typical person is anywhere from 3-5 g depending on the person. A g-suit will typically add 1 g of tolerance to that limit. Pilots still need to practice the 'g-straining maneuver' that consists of tensing the abdominal muscles in order to tighten blood vessels so as to reduce blood pooling in the lower body. High g is not comfortable, even with a g-suit. In older fighter aircraft, 6 g was considered a high level, but with modern fighters 9 g or more can be sustained structurally making the pilot the critical factor in maintaining high maneuverability in close aerial combat.|$|E
40|$|Small {{sample size}} (n less than 1 O) and {{inappropriate}} analysis of multivariate data have hindered previous attempts to describe which physiologic and demographic variables {{are most important}} in determining how long humans can tolerate acceleration. Data from previous centrifuge studies conducted at NASA/Ames Research Center, utilizing a 7 - 14 d bed rest protocol to simulate weightlessness, {{were included in the}} current investigation. After review, data on 25 women and 22 men were available for analysis. Study variables included gender, age, weight, height, percent body fat, resting heart rate, mean arterial pressure, Vo(sub 2) max and plasma volume. Since the dependent variable was time to <b>greyout</b> (failure), two contemporary biostatistical modeling procedures (proportional hazard and logistic discriminant function) were used to estimate risk, given a particular subject's profile. After adjusting for pro-bed-rest tolerance time, none of the profile variables remained in the risk equation for post-bed-rest tolerance <b>greyout.</b> However, prior to bed rest, risk of <b>greyout</b> could be predicted with 91 % accuracy. All of the profile variables except weight, MAP, and those related to inherent aerobic capacity (Vo(sub 2) max, percent body fat, resting heart rate) entered the risk equation for pro-bed-rest <b>greyout.</b> A cross-validation using 24 new subjects indicated a very stable model for risk prediction, accurate within 5 % of the original equation. The result for the inherent fitness variables is significant in that a consensus as to whether an increased aerobic capacity is beneficial or detrimental has not been satisfactorily established. We conclude that tolerance to +Gz acceleration before and after simulated weightlessness is independent of inherent aerobic fitness...|$|E
