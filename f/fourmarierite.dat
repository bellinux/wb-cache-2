50|$|The schoepite {{subgroup}} of the <b>fourmarierite</b> group: schoepite, metaschoepite, paraschoepite, and “dehydrated schoepite”, {{are closely related}} hexavalent uranium (uranyl) oxide hydrates/hydroxides. Schoepite was first described by T. L. Walker in 1923 and {{the determination of the}} relationship between the various subgroups has since been ongoing. Detailed X-ray powder diffraction and single crystal studies have led to a better understanding of the natural dehydration process of schoepite that result in the rest of the subgroup. “Dehydrated schoepite” has now been formally described as a mineral species by a team of geologists led by Joel Brugger of the University of Adelaide, Australia and given the name paulscherrerite, with the formula UO3 · 1.02H2O.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the copper {{for which it is}} known, Katanga was also rich in other minerals. The company controlled the exports of cobalt (the UMHK was responsible for 75 percent of world production during the 1950s), tin, uranium and zinc in its mines, among the richest in the world. Henri Buttgenbach, a famous Belgian metallurgist and administrator of UMHK from 1911, described cornetite, <b>fourmarierite,</b> cuprosklodowskite and thoreaulite. The finding of radium deposits in Katanga at the same time eventually led to a Belgian radium-extracting industry. Johannes Franciscus Vaes, who has studied minerals coming from the UMHK, is responsible for the discovery of billietite, masuyite, renierite, richetite, schuilingite-(Nd), sengierite, tudtite and vandendriesscheite. Gaston Briart, after whom Briartite is named, was a UMHK consultant.|$|E
40|$|Structures {{have been}} refined for twelve {{crystals}} of <b>fourmarierite</b> from various localities in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and one synthetic crystal. Single-crystal diffraction {{data were collected}} using MoKa X-radiation and a CCD-based detector mounted on a Bruker three-circle diffractometer. All crystals have orthorhombic symmetry, space group Bb 21 m. The natural crystals have similar unit-cell parameters: a 14. 00 – 14. 03, b 16. 40 – 16. 48, c 14. 32 – 14. 38 Å. The parameters for the synthetic crystal, which contains less Pb than the natural crystals, are a 13. 938 (2), b 16. 638 (3), c 14. 672 (2) Å. The structures refined to agreement indices (R 1) {{in the range of}} 3. 6 to 6. 2 %. The structure of <b>fourmarierite</b> contains uranyl pentagonal bipyramids that share edges and corners to form sheets oriented parallel to (001). There are two distinct Pb 2 + cations and eight H 2 O groups located in the interlayer. On the basis of the structure refinements, the site occupancy of Pb(1) in the natural crystals is typically deficient, ranging from 71 to 100 %, whereas the site occupancy of Pb(2) is ~ 100 % in the crystals studied. In the synthetic crystal the Pb(1) and Pb(2) occupancies are 13 % and 87 %, respectively. Increase of the Pb content is correlated with a minor increase in the a unit-cell parameter, as well as large decreases in the b and c unit-cell parameters, and the unit-cell volume. The substitution O 2 – $ (OH) – at two anion sites [O(12) and O(15) ] in the sheet of uranyl polyhedra provides the charge-balance mechanism associated with interlayer cation variation. The structural formula for <b>fourmarierite</b> may be written as Pb 1 –x[(UO 2) 4 O 3 – 2 x(OH) 4 + 2 x](H 2 O) 4, Z = 8, with the constituents of the sheet of uranyl polyhedra enclosed in square braces...|$|E
40|$|The {{morphology}} of basal {{faces of}} uranyl-sheet minerals is predicted {{by considering the}} bond-valence deficiency of the chains of polyhedra, the shift between the layers, and {{the arrangement of the}} interstitial complexes between the layers. The sheet struc-tural units of schoepite, [(UO 2) 8 O 2 (OH) 12](H 2 O) 12, and <b>fourmarierite,</b> Pb[(UO 2) 4 O 3 (OH) 4](H 2 O) 4, have the same underlying anion-topology. The stabilities of their edges differ because adjacent layers in schoepite are shifted by one chain of polyhedra, whereas adjacent layers are not shifted in <b>fourmarierite.</b> The minerals becquerelite, [7]Ca(H 2 O) 4 [(UO 2) 3 O 2 (OH) 3] 2 (H 2 O) 4, compreignacite, [7]K 2 (H 2 O) 3 [(UO 2) 3 O 2 (OH) 3] 2 (H 2 O) 4, billietite, [10]Ba(H 2 O) 4 [(UO 2) 3 O 2 (OH) 3] 2 (H 2 O) 3, protasite, [10]Ba(H 2 O) 3 [(UO 2) 3 O 3 (OH) 2], and masuyite, [10]Pb(H 2 O) 3 [(UO 2) 3 O 3 (OH) 2], all have structural units with the same basic anion-topology. The stabilities of their edges differ because of the different arrangements of interstitial species. In becquerelite, the interstitial cations are arranged in rows parallel to [010], whereas in billietite and compreignacite, the interstitial cations are arranged in rows parallel to [100]. For masuyite and protasite, the stability of their edges is defined by large differences in the bond-valence deficiencies of the chains of polyhedra with left and right terminations. The stabilities of edges in curite, Pb 3 [(UO 2) 8 O 8 (OH) 6](H 2 O) 3, are dictated by the low bond-valence deficiencies of the chains of polyhedra parallel to [001] and [011], and by the arrangement of cations in rows parallel to [001]. Minerals of the carnotite group contain the structural unit [(UO 2) 2 (V 2 O 8) ] 2 –, and the stability of the edges of their sheets is determined by the low bond-valence deficiency of chains o...|$|E

Two novel Pb uranyl oxide hydrates were found, with structural formulae Pb 2 (H 2 O) [(UO 2) 10 UO 12 (OH) 6 (H 2 O) 2] and Pb 0. 5 [(UO 2) 4 O 2 (OH) 5](H 2 O) 4 (Pb-poor <b>fourmarierite).</b> The synthesis products {{are related to the}} Pb:U molar ratio of the solution, and indicate a trend from curite, Pb 3 +x(H 2 O) 2 [(UO 2) 4 O 4 +x(OH) 3 –x] 2, to Pb 2 (H 2 O) [(UO 2) 10 UO 12 (OH) 6 (H 2 O) 2], then to Pb 0. 5 [(UO 2) 4 O 2 (OH) 5](H 2 O) 4 with decreasing Pb in the solution. The structure of Pb 2 (H 2 O) [(UO 2) 10 UO 12 (OH) 6 (H 2 O) 2], Z = 4, monoclinic, space group C 2 /c, a 13. 281 (5), b 10. 223 (4), c 26. 10 (1) Å, 103. 202 (6) °, V 3450 (2) Å 3, was solved by direct methods and refined on the basis of F 2 using 4065 unique reflections. The agreement index (R 1) was 6. 38 %, calculated for 1306 unique observed reflections (|Fo | ≥ 4 F). The structure contains complex chains of edge- and vertex-sharing uranyl pentagonal and square bipyramids, as well as distorted U 6 +O 6 octahedra, along both the [110] and [¯ 110] directions. The chains in the two orientations are linked at z ≈ 0. 25 and z ≈ 0. 75, forming a framework that contains elongate open channels.

40|$|Understanding the mechanism(s) of uranium-mineral {{dissolution}} {{is crucial}} for predictive modeling of U mobility in the subsurface. In order to understand how pH and type of cation in solution may affect dissolution, experiments were performed on mainly single crystals of curite, Pb 2 + 3 (H 2 O) 2 [(UO 2) 4 O 4 (OH) 3] 2, becquerelite, Ca(H 2 O) 8 [(UO 2) 6 O 4 (OH) 6], billietite, Ba(H 2 O) 7 [(UO 2) 6 O 4 (OH) 6], <b>fourmarierite</b> Pb 2 + 1 −x(H 2 O) 4 [(UO 2) 4 O 3 − 2 x(OH) 4 + 2 x] (x= 0. 00 - 0. 50), uranophane, Ca(H 2 O) 5 [(UO 2) (SiO 3 OH) ] 2, zippeite, K 3 (H 2 O) 3 [(UO 2) 4 (SO 4) 2 O 3 (OH) ], and Na-substituted metaschoepite, Na 1 −x[(UO 2) 4 O 2 −x(OH) 5 +x] (H 2 O) n. Solutions included: deionized water; aqueous HCl solutions at pH 3. 5 and 2; 0. 5 mol L− 1 Pb(II) -, Ba-, Sr-, Ca-, Mg-, HCl solutions at pH 2; 1. 0 mol L− 1 Na- and K-HCl solutions at pH 2; and a 0. 1 mol L− 1 Na 2 CO 3 solution at pH 10. 5. Uranyl mineral basal surface microtopography, micromorphology, and composition were examined prior to, and after dissolution experiments on micrometer scale specimens using atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Evolution of etch pit depth at different pH values and experimental durations can be explained using a stepwave dissolution model. Effects of the cation in solution on etch pit symmetry and morphology can be explained using an adsorption model involving specific surface sites. Surface precipitation of the following phases was observed: (a) a highly-hydrated uranyl-hydroxy-hydrate in ultrapure water (on all minerals), (b) a Na-uranyl-hydroxy-hydrate in Na 2 CO 3 solution of pH 10. 5 (on uranyl-hydroxy-hydrate minerals), (c) a Na-uranyl-carbonate on zippeite, (d) Ba- and Pb-uranyl-hydroxy-hydrates in Ba-HCl and Pb-HCl solutions of pH 2 (on uranophane), (e) a (SiOx(OH) 4 − 2 x) phase in solutions of pH 2 (uranophane), and (f) sulfate-bearing phases in solutions of pH 2 and 3. 5 (on zippeite...|$|E
