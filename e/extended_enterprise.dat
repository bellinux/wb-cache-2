40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the importance of Knowledge Management (KM) in <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Global competitiveness poses flexibility challenges in a time-based competition. One of the strategies adopted in industry is to develop <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises</b> by improving the level of collaboration between various autonomous firms. This coupled with several knowledge changes require a new focus on effective knowledge management. Judicious use of IT to form and support <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises</b> that gain from KM efforts is important. This paper presents the need and scope of Knowledge Management in enterprises facing the global competitive challenges. The emphasis of knowledge management as a process with a synergy between university and industry efforts is also outlined. A visionary approach based on a simulator and AI based architecture is discussed. It is suggested that models that promote IT based integration between objectives, decision and information (ODI) integration will be expedient for the evolving <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises</b> and virtual enterprises domains...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Extended</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Modeling Language (EEML) is {{from the}} late 1990s, {{developed}} in the EU project EXTERNAL as extension of the Action Port Model (APM) by S.

40|$|In <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises,</b> {{real-time}} {{manufacturing information}} tracking {{plays an important}} role and aims to provide the right information to the right person at the right time in the right format to achieve optimal production management among the involved enterprises. However, many enterprises are caused by lack of timely, accurate and consistent manufacturing data. The laggard information transfer flow and the unmatched information transfer method bring <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises</b> much more uncertainty and unknowingness. This paper proposes a RFID-enabled real-time manufacturing information tracking infrastructure (RTMITI) to address the real-time manufacturing data capturing and manufacturing information processing methods for <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Following the proposed infrastructure, the traditional manufacturing resources such as employees, machines and materials are equipped with RFID devices (Readers and Tags) to build the real-time data capturing environment. In addition, a series of manufacturing information processing methods are established to calculate and track the real-time manufacturing information such as real-time manufacturing cost, progress, WIP (Work-in-progress) inventory etc. in parts/assemblies/products at machines/shop floors/enterprises/ <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises</b> levels.

2500|$|<b>Extended</b> <b>Enterprise</b> Modeling Language (EEML) is a {{modelling}} language {{which combines}} structural modelling, business process modelling, goal modelling with goal hierarchies and resource modelling. It {{was intended to}} bridge the gap between goal modelling and other modelling approaches. According to Johannesson and Söderström (2008) [...] "the process logic in EEML is mainly expressed through nested structures of tasks and decision points. The sequencing of tasks is expressed by the flow relation between decision points. Each task has an input port and the output port being decision points for modeling process logic".|$|E

40|$|International audienceWhen {{it is made}} {{explicit}} by someone, knowledge becomes {{information source}} of knowledge for someone else. Thus knowledge sharing cannot be reduced to information sharing. The aim {{of this paper is}} promote knowledge sharing, whether tacit or "explicited" by individuals within <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises.</b> Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems aim at an integrated management of all product‐related information and processes within <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises</b> throughout the entire lifecycle of a product. In this paper, we propose (1) to outline a semantic interoperability between a collaborative platform and a Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) system, and (2) to highlight the conditions under which a piece of information shared through a PLM system may lead to one and only one interpretation. Step (1) allows individuals to construct a shared understanding, supporting tacit knowledge sharing, whereas step (2) leads to ensure explicited knowledge sharing, i. e. knowledge that has been made explicit by someone within a certain context. PLM systems are strongly integrated within <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises</b> and their use will illustrate in this paper how our approach supports knowledge sharing. The conditions and limits of our approach, as well as its study within industrial fields, are discussed {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|R

40|$|In <b>extended</b> <b>enterprises,</b> the {{traditional}} dichotomy between insiders and outsiders becomes blurred: consultants, freelance administrators and employees of business partners are both ?inside? and ?outside? of the enterprise. As a consequence, traditional controls to mitigate insider and outsider threat do not completely apply {{to this group}} of individuals, and additional or improved solutions are required. The ISO 27002 security standard, recognizing this need, proposes third-party agreements to cover security requirements in B 2 B relationships as a solution, but leaves open how to realize them to counter security problems of inter-organizational collaboration. To reduce this gap, this chapter presents a method for identifying external insiders and analyzing them from two perspectives: as threat and as possible mitigation. The output of the method provides input for further engineering of third-party agreements related to non-measurable IT security agreements; we illustrate the method using a manufacturer-retailer example.
