40|$|<b>Early</b> <b>adolescent</b> {{drinking}} {{has been}} identified as an important risk factor for the development of alcohol dependence. Both perceived peer drinking and personality profiles have been implicated as risk factors for <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> drinking. However, research is yet to determine how these 2 factors may interact to increase such risk. This study aimed to determine whether personality profiles moderated the relationship between perceived peer drinking and <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> drinking. Baseline data were utilized in the analyses, from 3, 287 adolescents (Mage = 13. 51 years, SD =. 58; 54 % female; 78 % born in Australia) participating in the Climate Schools Combined Study (a cluster randomized controlled trial with 75 schools located across Queensland, New South Wales, and Western Australia, Australia). Lifetime consumption of alcohol, perceived peer drinking, and personality profiles (Substance Use Risk Profile Scale) were measured. A moderated binary logistic regression found the personality profiles of impulsivity, sensation seeking, and hopelessness were positively related to <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> drinking, whereas anxiety sensitivity had a negative association. A significant interaction revealed that adolescents with higher levels of sensation seeking and who perceived their peers to be drinking {{were significantly more likely to}} report <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> drinking (consumption of a full standard drink; OR = 1. 043; 95 % CI [1. 018 – 1. 069]). These results indicate that perception of peer drinking is more strongly associated with <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> drinking, when adolescents are also high on sensation seeking. Prevention and intervention programs could consider targeting both sensation seeking and perceived peer drinking in adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved...|$|R

In particular, the associations of parental autonomy granting, behavioural control and warmth to adolescent depression, self-esteem, delinquent behaviours and substance use were investigated. Bi-directionality from <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> functioning to changes in parenting was also assessed. Results {{of a series of}} path analyses indicated that initial levels of parenting, particularly warmth, were related to <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> adjustment; and that initial levels of parental warmth were associated to changes in self-esteem, but not in the other indices of adjustment. Other findings revealed that changes in all three parenting practices were connected to change in the developmental trajectories of adolescents over a four-year period, from approximately age 13 at Time 1 year of the study and age 16 at Time 2. Transactional effects were found for two of the <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> variables, depression and substance use; these results revealed that <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> adjustment was linked to changes over time in parental behavioural control and warmth. These findings point to the potential significance of adapting parenting practices throughout adolescence to enhance adolescent well-being over time, {{as well as to the}} value of contributions from specific <b>early</b> <b>adolescent</b> adjustment variables to changes in parenting practices.

Thus, the study used a 2 × 2 factorial design representing {{two levels of}} gender (boy versus girl) and two levels of stage of development (early versus late adolescence). The measure of aggressive behaviour was administered on the sample for data collection. It was found that regardless of stage of development, boys expressed significantly higher rates of aggression than girls.

50|$|Aside from {{examining}} {{the impact of}} parental meta-emotion on children's affect and depressive symptomatology, some psychologists have researched the influence of meta-emotion {{on the development of}} children's coping strategies. Lagacé-Séguin & Gionet (2009) were interested in studying the nature versus nurture debate regarding children's development of coping strategies. To do so, they examined the impact of both temperament (nature) and parental meta-emotion philosophy (nurture) on the development of coping skills in <b>early</b> <b>adolescents.</b> The authors found many interactions between parental meta-emotion and the adolescent's temperament. For example, they found that emotion-coaching parenting was related to distraction coping strategies for children with lower negative affect and higher surgency. The authors concluded that parental meta-emotion philosophy styles can interact with a child's temperament and predict the adolescents' coping styles.|$|E

50|$|The chronological {{relationship}} between changing gender dynamics and {{the dissolution of}} organized, hierarchical cliques is well-established, but not fully understood. One theory asserts that sex cleavage both arises and wanes because cliques are largely sorted by common interests: girls and boys are generally interested in different activities until dating emerges, after which they share a highly valued activity.(164) This idea {{is consistent with the}} direct {{relationship between}} pubertal development and the appearance of other-sex friends.One possible explanation for this progression argues that children are socialized from childhood to conform to gender roles and during early adolescence cognitive developments promote active self-presentation and anxiety over peer-perceptions; as a result, <b>early</b> <b>adolescents</b> become more consciously aware of both the benefits of conventional gender identity and the threat of ridicule or rejection in response to unorthodox behavior. According to this framework, gender segregation subsides because the same inculcated gender roles that prompt children to distance themselves from anything associated with the opposite sex also encourage adolescents and adults to demonstrate heterosexual desire and sexual/seductive competence. This argument explains the drastic shift in the targets of ridicule from those who were too androgynous in middle school to those who can not or do not attract sexual attention in high school.|$|E

Consistent with expectations, mean levels of substance use did not differ by gender or ethnicity (Caucasians and Hispanics).

5000|$|The {{number of}} {{children}} with incarcerated parents has increased over the past 25 years. 1 in every 28 children (3.6 percent) has a parent incarcerated, two-thirds of these parents are incarcerated for non-violent offenses. Although there are many children who {{feel as though they}} have experienced loss due to their parents being in prison, there are more instances where black and Latino children are forced to live with the consequences of their parent's actions. Compared to the 1 in 110 white children who have at least one parent incarcerated, 1 in 15 black children and 1 in 41 Hispanic children have a parent who is incarcerated. The mental effects children of incarcerated parents are comparable to that of children who have lost their parent due to death or divorce. These children are more likely to experience an increased risk for mental health problems compared to other children their age. [...] The mental health problems are connected to the social stigma that they encounter when their parents are arrested, or when their peers find out that of their parent’s incarceration. Because of this fear that children will experience mental disparities, some parents and caregivers hide their incarceration from the children by telling them that the parent is on vacation or that they went away to college. These lies foster an overwhelming amount of stress and confusion on the child once they find out the truth. Age and gender is another factor that influences how children cope and react to their parent being incarcerated. Young children tend to develop mental and emotional trauma. Children between the ages of 2 and 6 are prone to feelings of separation anxiety, traumatic stress, and survivor’s guilt. <b>Early</b> <b>adolescents</b> may grow up and be unable to cope with future trauma, they develop poor concepts of themselves, and when faced with minor stress that might be unable to cope. As children get around the ages of 11-14 their reaction to their parent’s incarceration starts to reflect in their behavior. Males are more likely to express aggression and acts of delinquency, while females tend to internalize their emotions by acts of seeking attention. As these children become adults from the ages of 15-18, they prematurely take on the dependency, and tend to disconnect from their parents. This will lead to acts of criminal behavior and ultimately a cycle of incarceration.|$|E
