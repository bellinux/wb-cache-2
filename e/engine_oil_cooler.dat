25|$|The first Supra Turbo was {{introduced}} in 1987. The inter-cooled, turbo charged version of the 3.0-liter inline 6-cylinder engine boosted power to 230hp (172kW; 233 PS) 240lb·ft (325 N·m). The Turbo model also included an <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> and integrated rear spoiler. The sports package, which was standard on the Turbo and optional on the base model, included a limited slip differential (LSD), TEMS, and headlamp washers. A new Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) was optional on both models. Also in 87 a new beige/tan color combination was implemented, and only 1000 models were produced with this scheme. Toyota installed its variable induction technology into the DOHC twin turbo 1G-GT called T-VIS and also included it into the 7M-GT engine as well.|$|E

2500|$|The 428 CJ was {{no longer}} the top engine choice; the {{ultimate}} engine option was the 428-4V Super Cobra Jet (SCJ). This engine was specifically designed for drag racing, and the option package was referred to as the [...] "Drag Pack." [...] This engine option could be ordered with the Q-code 428-4V or the R-code 'Ram Air' equipped 428-4V.

2500|$|In 1993, three North American {{models were}} offered; the [...] "base", the touring, and the R models. The touring FD {{included}} a sunroof, fog lights, leather seats, a {{rear window wiper}} and a Bose Acoustic Wave system. The R (R1 in 1993 and R2 in 1994–95) models featured stiffer suspensions, an additional <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> an aerodynamics package, purple-hued microfiber seats, and Z-rated tires. [...] In 1994, the interior received a small update to include a passenger air bag, and a PEG (performance equipment group) model was offered. [...] This model featured leather seats and a sunroof. [...] It {{did not include the}} fog lights or Bose stereo of the touring package. [...] In 1995, the touring package was replaced by the PEP (popular equipment package).

2500|$|Powertrain {{detail of}} the Audi V8 {{featured}} one of two all-new, all-aluminium alloy engines – both petrol engines, and both in V8 configuration with 32 valves (four valves per cylinder) with dual valve springs, and four overhead camshafts (DOHC). The design set the pattern for future Audi-developed Volkswagen Group V8 engines. In addition to using an all-aluminum alloy cylinder block (when the established material was grey cast iron), the camshafts were driven using a hybrid method. A rubber/kevlar toothed timing belt, driven {{from the front of}} the crankshaft operated only the exhaust camshaft in each bank. [...] The inlet camshafts were then operated via a simplex roller chain from the exhaust camshaft – the right bank, (cylinders 1–4) at the rear of the engine, and the left bank (cylinders 5–8) at the front of the engine, immediately behind the timing belt. This method reduced the complexity of the timing belt layout, and as a result, required fewer components, such as idler rollers and guides, and lead to easier and less costly maintenance of the timing belt and associated components. [...] The intervals for changing the timing belts varied; the 3.6V8 (PT) required changing every , whereas the 4.2V8 (ABH) had a longer interval at [...] A thermostatically controlled electric cooling fan also became standard, replacing the engine-driven viscous fans on earlier cars. [...] This not only provided forced airflow for the engine coolant radiator, but also for the smaller <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{test centre}} {{assisted}} the BMW firm {{in developing the}} factory-produced forward cowling — which had the <b>engine's</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> integrated into it from the beginning — for the Bavarian firm's BMW 801 fourteen-cylinder radial engine used in many German Luftwaffe military aircraft, most importantly the Fw 190A; trials indicated {{it was possible to}} reduce drag enough to save , as well as to maximize pressure build-up to assist cooling. [...] It also helped in development of the Argus As 014 pulsejet used in the V-1. In collaboration with Göttingen and DVL (Berlin-Adlershof), it also contributed {{to the development of the}} swept wing (what Germans called Pfeilflüge, or [...] "arrow wing").|$|R

5000|$|The Fiat-Abarth 850TC Berlina (Turismo Competizione, or [...] "touring competition") was {{introduced}} {{towards the end}} of 1960. It uses the Fiat 600 bodywork with some modifications, most notably a boxlike structure ahead of the front bumper which held the <b>engine's</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooler.</b> The rear fenders were usually blistered, so as to accommodate larger wheels. The engine is a four-cylinder model based on a Fiat unit, with 847 cc capacity and [...] CUNA rating. Overall length is 3090 mm, overall width is 1400 mm, height is 1380 mm, wheelbase is 2000 mm, and its front and rear track are 1160 mm.

2500|$|The engine line-up {{received}} major changes, {{and only}} the 250 CID I-6, 302-2V and the 351W-2V were carried over from 1969. [...] Most models continued to feature the 250 CID I-6 as the standard engine. Optional engines included the 302-2V (standard on GT and Brougham models), 351W-2V, the new 351 Cleveland available with a 2- or 4-barrel carburetor, and the new 429-4V 385 Series V8 (standard on the Cobra models). It {{should be noted that}} selecting the 351-2V on the option list could have resulted in the buyer receiving either the 351W-2V or the 351C-2V; both shared the same power rating and VIN code. The 429-4V was available in three different versions. The first was the 429 Thunder Jet, the standard engine for the Cobra, rated at [...] Next was the 429 CJ (Cobra Jet), rated at , which included a 2-bolt main block, hydraulic lifters, a 700 CFM Holley or 715 CFM Rochester Quadrajet carburetor, and was available with or without Ram Air. The top 429 option was the 429 SCJ (Super Cobra Jet), rated a , and was part of the [...] "Drag Pack" [...] option. Selecting the [...] "Drag Pack" [...] option turned a 429 CJ into a 429 SCJ. The drag pack required either the 3.91:1 or the 4.30:1 axle ratio, and included a 4-bolt main engine block, forged pistons, 780 CFM Holley carburetor, <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooler,</b> and a solid lifter cam. The [...] "Detroit Locker" [...] rear differential was included when the 4.30:1 axle was ordered while the [...] "Traction-Lock" [...] limited-slip differential was included with the 3.91:1 axle. The 429 SCJ was available with or without Ram Air induction, both versions sharing the same power ratings. Ram Air induction was also optional on the 351C-4V. The Ram Air option was revised to include a new [...] "shaker hood" [...] where the scoop was attached {{to the top of the}} air cleaner assembly, and protruded through a hole in the hood. The 'shaker' nickname came from the fact that it vibrated, or shook, when the engine was running. A 3-speed transmission was standard on all models except the Cobra. The Cruise-O-Matic and 4-speed transmissions remained options.|$|E

5000|$|Inline and radial engines {{were both}} {{incorporated}} into the Kraftei concept : the Junkers Jumo 211 was a pioneering example of engine unitization, as used on both the Junkers Ju 88 using a novel annular radiator for both main engine coolant and <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> needs, with exactly the same nacelle packaging used to power the Messerschmitt Me 264 V1's first flights. Both the examples of the Dornier Do 217 medium bomber powered by inline engines, and the Axis Powers' largest-flown powered aircraft of any type, the Blohm & Voss BV 238 flying boat used essentially the same unitized Daimler-Benz DB 603 powerplants, complete with [...] "chin" [...] radiators under the nacelles as integral components. A differing Kraftei physical packaging is also {{believed to have been}} crafted by the Heinkel firm for the DB 603 engines used on its Heinkel He 219A night fighter, as {{what appears to be the}} same exact engine installation design used for the He 219A was also used for the quartet of ordered airframes for the same firm's He 177B four-DB 603-engined heavy bomber design's prototype series, as both airframe types' engine [...] "units" [...] used annular radiators and cylindrical cowls of identical appearance to enclose them.

50|$|Engine reject heat can be {{used for}} {{building}} heating or heating a process. In an engine, roughly half the waste heat arises (from the <b>engine</b> jacket, <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> and after-cooler circuits) as hot water which can be at up to 110 °C. The remainder arises as high-temperature heat which can generate pressurised hot water or steam by the use of an exhaust gas heat exchanger.|$|R
50|$|Similarly, it {{is usually}} {{desirable}} to minimize the number of heat transfer stages {{in order to maximize}} the temperature difference at each stage.

50|$|Its engine, transmission, and {{cylinder}} heads were constructed of light alloy. An <b>engine</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> (located {{in the engine}} fan's shroud) ensured optimal engine operating temperature and long engine life, optimized by a thermostat that bypassed the oil cooler when the engine was cold. Later models of the carburetor featured an automatic choke. Engine intake air passed through a metallic filter, while heavier particles were captured by an oil bath.

40|$|This work {{describes}} a simplified methodology to model (air-side) a heat exchanger within a {{computational fluid dynamics}} analysis of an <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> device for aerospace applications. Although several CFD solvers provide specific tools to simulate a heat exchanger, sometimes the available data, as for example, cooling plate geometries, dimensions and their arrangement in the heat exchanger, are not exhaustive enough {{to set up the}} numerical simulation. Hence, in the present research was used a porous media model to simulate the main effects of the heat exchanger, such as pressure drop and heat rejection, on the flowfield occurs place inside an aircraft <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> system. In this way, the need to model the real complex geometry of the heat exchanger is avoided. In this framework, present analyses aim at verifying that the heat exchanger, under investigation, is able to satisfy the system requirements in terms of heat rejection of the <b>engine's</b> <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> system, foreseen for the aircraft operating conditions. In particular, the paper analyzes a turboprop <b>oil</b> <b>cooler</b> heat exchanger when the aircraft is flying at cruise conditions, namely 2743 m (9000 ft) altitude, focusing attention on several heat exchanger flow field features such as air pressure drop, temperature change and mass flow rate. Finally, those numerical results are analyzed in detail and compared to experimental data available for the heat exchanger, thus pointing out that this design approach represents a viable option in the framework of <b>oil</b> <b>cooling</b> heat exchanger performance investigation. © 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
