In April 2009, Murphy told the Los Angeles Times {{that he would like}} to have Mays perform the song on Glee.

Colfer re-iterated his desire to perform [...] "Time Warp" [...] at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International, which prompted Murphy to reveal that a Glee episode devoted to Rocky Horror was planned for the show's second season. At the 2010 Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, Murphy stated he would be directing the episode, and also revealed that Adam Shankman would guest-direct one of the first ten episodes of the season.

[...] The Lanterns Alex Antonetz wrote that both [...] "Numb" [...] and [...] "Euphoria" [...] are future Charlie Bear fare. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush commented that the song <b>is</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> the clubs. Ryan Hadfield of Consequence of Sound labeled [...] "Numb" [...] together with [...] "Can't Stop Won't Stop" [...] and [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] as essential tracks on Looking 4 Myself. Andrew Unterberger of Popdust wrote that the single's production is appropriate for an Usher and Swedish House Mafia collaboration, though criticised its lack of originality. Despite this, Unterberger commended the song, writing [...] "it does have the mind-numbing, body-activating effect the song is so explicitly searching for" [...] and even though you can call it [...] "an EDM cash-in [...] Usher was embracing club music way before most of his American pop star peers hopped on the bandwagon".|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club awarded [...] "Wake Up" [...] and [...] "Escape {{from the}} Citadel" [...] an [...] "A". Sava praised Nanjiani's [...] "delightfully low-key" [...] {{performance}} in the former, noting that his [...] "soft, smooth voice <b>is</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> a character that is so laid back he's completely flat, and his casual delivery of ominous lines helps keep the tone light as the material gets heavier." [...] Furthermore, {{he noted that the}} jokes were more pronounced in this episode, making the opening scene during Prismo's party that much funnier. Sava felt that the Lich's monologue to Finn in [...] "Escape from the Citadel" [...] was [...] "even creepier thanks to Ron Perlman's gravely voice for The Lich and the evocative staging by writers/storyboard artists Tom Herpich and Steve Wolfhard", who were able to [...] "achieve a fascinating combination of terror and hope when Finn touches The Lich with Guardian blood and starts a grotesquely stunning transformation that strips the villain of his power by making him a giant baby." [...] Sava also complimented the episode for being full of harsh realizations concerning Finn's father and the vulnerability of his body. Ultimately he concluded that [...] "the developments of these two episodes dramatically alter the series' status quo to give this season an added boost of momentum from the very beginning." ...|$|E

500|$|Most of {{the fifth}} (and final) book is a {{discussion}} of paranatellonta via the myth of Andromeda and Perseus. Manilius recalls how Andromeda was chosen to be sacrificed to a sea monster by her parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia. Andromeda was chained to a cliff, but, before the creature could consume its victim, Perseus (who had just vanquished Medusa) stumbled onto the scene. He instantly {{fell in love with}} Andromeda, killed the sea monster, and saved the young woman's life. According to Green, the digression, which is by far the longest in the poem, [...] "is very well chosen, in as much as no other mythological episode involves so many future constellations interacting at the same time: Andromeda (e.g.5.544), Perseus (e.g.5.67), the Sea Monsterstrictly, Cetus (cf.5.600), but often referred to in more generic terms during this story as belua (5.544, 608) and monstrum (5.581)Medusa's head (e.g.5.567), and Andromeda's parents, Cepheus and Cassiopeia". Green contends that the story <b>is</b> <b>perfect</b> <b>for</b> Manilius (he is able to use it to justify the constellations' proximity to one another and their eternal arrangement, as he had previously argued in 1.354360). Conversely, Housman compared it unfavorably to Ovid's version of the story, and called Manilius's retelling [...] "a sewn-on patch of far from the best purple" [...] (purpurae non sane splendidissimae adsutus pannus). A similar sentiment was expressed by the Cambridge classicist Arthur Woollgar Verrall, who wrote that while the episode {{was meant to be a}} [...] "show piece", it comes across as [...] "a poor mixture of childish rhetoric and utter commonplace". Between lines 5.70910, there is a large lacuna (raising the possibility that the Astronomica is an unfinished work), and then the last few lines of the book [...] concern stars and other stellar phenomena, and the book ends with a simile about the [...] "res publica of stars". This sectionin which Manilius proposes that the stars constitute an elaborate and organized commonwealth, defined by a hierarchy that prevents [...] "cosmic disaster"seems to be a way for Manilius to assert the legitimacy of the Roman state through analogy.|$|E
