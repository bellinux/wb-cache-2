50|$|Many zebra chip {{symptoms}} are evident before the potato is even harvested; foliar signs include chlorosis, leaf scorching, swollen nodes, vascular tissue browning, and curled leaves. Subterranean signs include collapsed stolons, <b>enlarged</b> <b>lenticels,</b> vascular tissue browning, medullary ray discoloration, and necrotic flecking of tuber tissue. The University of Nebraska cites the subterranean signs as the unique identification of zebra chip {{from all other}} known potato diseases. Zebra chip has been noted among potato disease experts as being unusually complex, and possibly the product of two separate pathogens, as has been discovered before for basses richesses (SBR) and spraing.|$|E
40|$|Nearly all {{understory}} {{plant species}} in semi-permanently flooded cypress-tupelo swamp forests grow on microsites located {{above the water}} level, as opposed to growing on the flooded forest floor. Our field study indicates that one such species, Itea virginica (Saxifragaceae), has a strong association with elevated microsites that changes with life stage: adults are found significantly more often {{on the forest floor}} than seedlings, although not as frequently as expected for the amount of forest floor vs. elevated microsites present. High water level may inhibit seedling establishment, but not adult growth, thus suggesting a potential ontogenetic expansion of flooding tolerance. We conducted greenhouse flooding experiments on seedlings and adults of various sizes with three treatments: high flood (a percentage of aboveground biomass submerged), waterlogged (only root systems submerged), and control (no flooding). The effect of initial height above water and treatment on relative growth rate was significant for the seedlings: RGR decreased with increasing flood level; however, there was no significant effect for adults. Seedlings were more negatively affected by flooding than adults due primarily to their small size rather than any differences in ability to produce flood responses (i. e., <b>enlarged</b> <b>lenticels</b> or adventitious roots). Additionally, we conducted seed experiments investigating the effects of different substrates and durations of flooding on germination success; there were no significant effects of either factor on seed germination. This study increases our understanding of regeneration biology and can be valuable in planning restoration activities in cypress-tupelo swamps...|$|E
40|$|Claviradulomyces xylopiae sp. nov. is {{introduced}} for a fungus occurring {{in association with}} abnormal (<b>enlarged,</b> spongy) <b>lenticels</b> of Xylopia sericea (Annonaceae), a common tree of the Atlantic forest and Cerrado ecosystems in Brazil. This is the second species described in the genus and, although it is morphologically distinct from the type species, C. dabeicola from West Africa, it possesses the same characteristics. Apothecial ascomata have periphysoids and paraphyses that are inflated apically (clavate), and ornamented with denticles (raduliform). Furthermore, similar to the type species, it also has long-cylindric or acerose, aseptate ascospores and conidia. An additional asexual morph was produced in culture and is described. Molecular studies of C. dabeicola and the new species confirmed a placement in Ostropales, although a relationship to Odontotremataceae was not supported. Both species were consistently in association with abnormal lenticular development on their woody hosts. It remains to be ascertained, however, if these are the causal agents of the bark disorders, or, simply, opportunistic colonisers. The finding of the second species in the genus Claviradulomyces on a plant from a distantly related family {{to that of the}} host of C. dabeicola (Erythroxylaceae) for the genus on a different continent suggests that fungi in this genus may be common on lenticels of other woody plants, and could even have a pantropical distribution. It is possible that fungi in the genus have remained unreported until now because lenticels have remained neglected as a habitat surveyed by mycologists...|$|R
40|$|Lenticels are {{macroscopic}} openings occurring on {{the surface}} of roots, shoots and some fruits like apples, pears, avocados and mangos and are responsible for gaseous exchange and transpiration. The discolouration of the lenticels of some mango cultivars is a serious problem, affecting the economic value of the fruit, especially in ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ while problems with lenticel discolouration are seldom found in ‘Kent’. Mango fruit lenticels develop from ruptured stomata on fruit from about 20 mm in ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ and 30 to 40 mm in ‘Kent’. <b>Lenticels</b> <b>enlarge</b> as the fruit grows due to stretching of the fruit surface, reaching their maximum size on adult fruit. Fully developed lenticels of ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ are larger in size than those of ‘Kent’. ‘Kent’ lenticels are also better insulated than ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’, having a thick cuticle in the lenticel cavity and in some instances a phellogen is also present, while both of above mentioned characteristics are absent in ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’. Resin present in the skin of the fruit {{plays an important role in}} the discolouration of ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ lenticels. The resin of both ‘TA’ and ‘Keitt’ fruit contain a considerable amount of an aggressive compound termed terpenes. These terpenes are volatile and are able to move out of the resin ducts via the sublenticellular cells to the outside of the fruit through the lenticels. The integrity of tonoplasts of the sublenticellular cells are lost due to the action of the terpenes, causing vacuolar bound phenols to come into contact with polyphenol oxidase present in the cell walls. The product of the resultant reaction is a quinone accumulating as a brownish deposit in the cell walls, visible from the outside as black markings around the lenticels. Lenticel discolouration may, however also occur due to maltreatment or rough handling of fruit, high temperatures in the warm water bath, extended brushing on packline or breaking of the cold chain and spilling of resin onto the surface of the fruit.
