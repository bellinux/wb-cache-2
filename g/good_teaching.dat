Deadlocks were a problem, but they were the {{exception}} rather than the norm; many legislatures did not deadlock over elections at all. Most of those that did in the 19th century were the newly admitted western states, which suffered from [...] "inexperienced legislatures and weak party discipline...as western legislatures gained experience, deadlocks became less frequent." [...] While Utah suffered from deadlocks in 1897 and 1899, they became what Zywicki refers to as [...] "a <b>good</b> <b>teaching</b> experience," [...] and Utah never again failed to elect senators. Another concern was that when deadlocks occurred, state legislatures were unable to conduct their other normal business; James Christian Ure, writing in the South Texas Law Review, notes that this did not in fact occur. In a deadlock situation, state legislatures would deal with the matter by holding [...] "one vote at the beginning of the day—then the legislators would continue with their normal affairs".|$|E

40|$|Context and {{objectives}} <b>Good</b> clinical <b>teaching</b> {{is central to}} medical education but there is concern about maintaining this in contemporary, pressured health care environments, This paper aims to demonstrate that good clinical practice is at the heart: of <b>good</b> clinical <b>teaching.</b> Methods Seven roles are used {{as a framework for}} analysing <b>good</b> clinical <b>teaching.</b> The roles are medical expert, communicator, collaborator, manager, advocate, scholar and professional. Results The analysis of clinical teaching and clinical practice demonstrates that they are closely linked. As experts, clinical teachers are involved in research, information retrieval and sharing of knowledge or <b>teaching.</b> <b>Good</b> communication with trainees, patients and colleagues defines teaching excellence. Clinicians can 2 ̆ 7 teach 2 ̆ 7 collaboration by acting as role models and by encouraging learners to understand the responsibilities of other health professionals. As managers, clinicians can apply their skills to the effective management of learning resources. Similarly skills as advocates at the individual, community and population level can be passed on in educational encounters. The clinicians 2 ̆ 7 responsibilities as scholars are most readily applied to teaching activities. Clinicians have clear roles in taking scholarly approaches to their practice and demonstrating them to others. Conclusion <b>Good</b> clinical <b>teaching</b> is concerned with providing role models for good practice, making good practice visible and explaining it to trainees. This is the very basis of clinicians as professionals, the seventh role, and should be the foundation for the further development of clinicians as excellent clinical teachers...|$|R

2500|$|Alexander Sutherland Neill {{was born}} in Forfar, Scotland, on 17 October 1883 to George and Mary Neill. He was their fourth son, {{one of the eight}} that survived of 13. He was raised in an austere, Calvinist house with values of fear, guilt, and adult and divine authority, which he later repudiated. As a child, he was obedient, quiet, and uninterested in school. His father was the village dominie (Scottish schoolmaster) of Kingsmuir, near Forfar in eastern Scotland, and his mother had been a teacher before her marriage. The village dominie held a {{position}} of prestige, hierarchically beneath that of upper classes, doctors, and clergymen. As typical of Scottish methods at the time, the dominie controlled overcrowded classrooms with his tawse, as corporal punishment. Neill feared his father, though he later claimed his father's imagination as a role model for <b>good</b> <b>teaching.</b> Scholars have interpreted Neill's harsh childhood as the impetus for his later philosophy, though his father was not shown to be harsher to Allie (as Neill was known) than to anyone else. Neill's mother ( [...] Sutherland Sinclair) held high standards for her family, and demanded comportment to set the family apart from the townspeople.|$|E

[...] Tom Bennett, the UK government's expert on pupil behaviour, said teachers had been [...] "dazzled" [...] by school computers. Andreas Schleicher, education director at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, urged schools to ensure that children gain a good grasp of reading, writing and mathematics, opining that school technology had raised [...] "too many false hopes (...) If you look at the best-performing education systems, such as those in East Asia, they've been very cautious about using technology in their classrooms," [...] (...) Those students who use tablets and computers very often tend to do worse than those who use them moderately.". In September 2015, a survey conducted by the OECD into the impact of heavy investments in digital technology within the classroom, showed that Pisa test results for reading, mathematics or science showed [...] "no noticeable improvement". In October 2015, a study by researchers at the University of Washington, Stanford University and the Mathematica policy research group discovered that on-line pupils fell far behind counterparts who studied within the classroom. The National Study of Online Charter Schools found [...] "significantly weaker academic performance" [...] in maths and reading in 'virtual schools' when compared with the conventional school system.|$|E

You know it was said of Dean Swift that he could write an admirable poem upon a broomstick, and the man who has a real knowledge of science can make the commonest object in the world subservient to an introduction to the principles and greater truths of natural knowledge. It is in that way that your science must be taught {{if it is to be}} of real service. Do not suppose any amount of book work, any repetition by rote of catechisms and other abominations of that kind are of value for our object. That is mere wasting of time. But take the commonest object and lead the child from that foundation to such truths of a higher order as may be within his grasp. With regard to drawing, I do not think there is any practical difficulty; but in respect to the scientific object lessons you want teachers trained in a manner different from that which now prevails.|$|E
