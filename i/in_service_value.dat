40|$|Nicht angegebenService {{oriented}} Utility Computing paves the {{way towards}} realization of service markets, which promise metered services through negotiable Service Level Agreements (SLA). A market does not necessarily imply a simple buyer-seller relationship, rather it is the culmination point of a complex chain of stake-holders with a hierarchical integration of value along each link in the chain. <b>In</b> <b>service</b> <b>value</b> chains, services corresponding to different partners are aggregated in a producer-consumer manner resulting in hierarchical structures of added value. SLAs are contracts between service providers and service consumers, which ensure the expected Quality of Service (QoS) to different stakeholders at various levels in this hierarchy. This thesis addresses the challenge of realizing SLA-centric infrastructure to enable service markets for Utility Computing. Service Level Agreements play a pivotal role throughout {{the life cycle of}} service aggregation. The activities of service selection and service negotiation followed by the hierarchical aggregation and validation of services <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>value</b> chain, require SLA as an enabling technology. This research aims at a SLA-centric framework where the requirement-driven selection of services, flexible SLA negotiation, hierarchical SLA aggregation and validation, and related issues such as privacy, trust and security have been formalized and the prototypes of the service selection model and the validation model have been implemented. The formal model for User-driven service selection utilizes Branch and Bound and Heuristic algorithms for its implementation. The formal model is then extended for SLA negotiation of configurable services of varying granularity in order to tweak the interests of the service consumers and service providers. ...|$|E

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} the paper is to adapt the SERVQUAL {{instrument}} and provide a unique analysis of service quality, value, customer satisfaction and loyalty of Singapore stock investors. Design/methodology/approach - The paper uses results from a mail survey with 300 copies of a self-administrated questionnaire utilising the SERVQUAL instrument with experienced stock investors using stockbroker (remisier) services in Singapore. Altogether, 169 useable returns (56 percent response rate) were analyzed. Findings - Investors expect high quality service from brokers, particularly in terms of reliability. There was a 15 percent gap in service quality, and a 20 percent gap <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>value.</b> Customers who relied on brokers' advice perceived higher service quality. Brokers need more empathy with customers. SERVQUAL translated to Singapore stock broking customers with good reliability. Research limitations/implications - Results may not generalize beyond Singapore or to other financial services. Practical implications - Brokers {{need to focus on}} personal, empathetic relationships with investors and aim for near perfect reliability in accurate and timely execution of customers' orders. Customers' level of expertise is important and brokers need to make more effort to educate their clients, and proactively advise them. Originality/value - Service quality, customer perceived value, customer satisfaction and loyalty of customers have been important research areas in the marketing literature.

Inorder to create effective {{and reliable}} deliveries, activities {{that do not}} create value for the customer,namely the wastes, need to be reduced or eliminated. Value Stream mapping is a Leanmanagement tool that aims to clean processes from the wastes. With this as a starting point, studieshave previously been conducted to customize the tool for use on service processes. The studyresulted <b>in</b> <b>Service</b> <b>value</b> stream management, a model implemented in six steps. When the modelis applied in service processes, {{there is a wide}} variety of problems that may occur, it is therefore considered not possible to collect all problems in order to provide suggestions for improvements. This study aims to investigate whether the tool can be modified to better suit an internal serviceprocess in the pulp and paper industry. The literature review that has been conducted, revealedthat the existing model does not contain certain, according to the theory, important elementsadapted for Lean service. Beside the waste and tools that the model already consists of, fourrelevant wastes and twelve tools were found during the literature review. Other interestingcomponents that emerged through the literature review, were the views of what an organizationshould learn about and how successes should be measured. In order to fulfill the purpose of ourstudy, the Lean tool Service value stream management, was tested with the additions found duringthe literature review. The test was conducted at an internal service process at a case company tosee if there is evidence to add or remove some of the new wastes, tools or components to themodel. At the case company, data was collected through interviews and observations as well asthrough a survey. The study resulted in the 5 K-model which consists five steps to eliminate andreduce wastes.

40|$|Abstract This study explores {{customer}} perceived {{value in}} the context of emerging technology-intensive business service, in particular a mobile advertising service that is at the application phase of development. The purpose of the study is to conceptualise customer perceived value as a multidimensional concept by exploring 1) the complex interaction between benefits and sacrifices 2) temporality and 3) learning. This way the study contributes to the existing research within services marketing and business relationships. The empirical part of the study is conducted {{in the form of a}} qualitative single-case study. The empirical setting organised to acquire data is qualitative real-life experiment. It consists of three field experiments that were organised by the research project to simulate real-life situations and to gain understanding of developing technological services that are not yet in commercial use. Interviews, observations and personal experiences form the main sources of information and are complemented by secondary documental data. In this study the sources of value are first identified, which enhances understanding of what kind of value customers perceive from emerging technological service. In addition, value sub-elements have a complex interaction <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>value</b> co-creation, since certain sacrifices made by users may increase the benefits they perceive, whereas some benefits can increase the sacrifices and thus reduce the customer perceived net value. Second, the concepts of expected value, realised value and potential value are identified which enables deeper understanding of the temporality of customer perceived value. Third, learning has an important role in customer perceived value. When looking at learning at the process level, it is a sacrifice, but at the outcome level it turns into a benefit and thus also amplifies the customer perceived net value. Learning is needed from the customer to be able to use the new technological service and utilise it effectively, which in turn leads the customer to perceive higher value from the service. Moreover, the temporal dimensions of value are connected to each other through the customer’s learning that varies according to its type and object at different points of time. For the service providers of new technological services understanding value related to the service and its production is essential. The future success and viability of these kinds of services requires that service providers know what kind of value their customers perceive from the service and especially what kind of future expectations they have for it. This study provides implications for the service providers on how to co-create value with their business customers and thus make technology-intensive business service a profitable business in the future...|$|E
40|$|The University of Arkansas {{has been}} a site of {{population}} and urban growth {{since its inception in}} 1871. This urban development has caused extreme changes in land use, and with this has also come a change in ecosystem services provided by the area. Ecosystem services are benefits acquired by humans that are provided by functions are an ecosystem (Constanza et al., 1997). Constanza developed a method for quantifying ecosystem services. In this method, Constanza valuated ecosystem services for biomes. These service values were based on the economic value of the service provided, and were given in dollar per hectare-year. A case study of Mullins Creek, an urban stream with its head waters located on the University of Arkansas campus, was the focus of this research project. Using delineation data from a previous research project on this stream, the watershed for Mullins Creek on campus was mapped in ArcGIS and the land use and land cover areas for the watershed found. The land use and land covers given in ArcGIS were converted to biomes as defined by Constanza. The geometric area for each biome in hectares was multiplied by the service value defined by Constanza, and a total dollar per year value for the watershed was calculated. After the present ecosystem service value for the watershed was found, the predeveloped watershed was considered. The land use and land cover for this watershed was estimated using historical information regarding the university. The land use areas were acquired from ArcGIS and multiplied by the service value for each land area to receive the dollar per year service value of the pre-developed watershed. With the present and pre-developed service values known, it was found that there was a significant loss in ecosystem service values since the university was founded. Therefore, a design for improvements was developed in order to recover some of the service values lost due to urbanization. A ?possible? watershed was developed with land use changes suggested that would increase service value without drastically changing current infrastructure and function of the urban area. Green roofs and pervious pavements were two land covers considered. Green roofs were suggested for specific buildings within the watershed, and pervious pavement was suggested for specific parking lots. These specific locations were identified in ArcGIS and the new land use areas found. These areas were again multiplied by the service values for each land use, with green roofs considered grass/rangelands at 75 % value, and pervious pavements as grass/rangelands at 50 % value. The calculated results showed that with the land use changes suggested, there would be a 7 % increase <b>in</b> <b>service</b> <b>value.</b> An economic analysis was performed to calculate the actual cost of implementing the suggested land use changes, and the costs were much more than the service value received. These results should not be a deterrent in considering land use changes for ecosystem service increase. The values found are not explicit values, but should be used for comparisons of land use change over time...|$|E

40|$|The {{unprecedented}} {{growth of}} urban areas {{all over the}} globe is nowadays maybe most apparent in China having undergone rapid urbanization since the late 1970 s. The need for new residential, commercial and industrial areas leads to new urban regions challenging sustainable development and the maintenance and creation of a high living standard as well as the preservation of ecological functionality. Therefore, timely and reliable information on land-cover changes and their consequent environmental impacts are needed to support sustainable urban development. The objective of this research is the analysis of land-cover changes, especially the development of urban areas in terms of speed, magnitude and resulting implications for the natural and rural environment using satellite imagery and the quantification of environmental impacts with the concepts of ecosystem services and landscape metrics. The study areas are the cities of Shanghai and Stockholm and the three highly-urbanized Chinese regions Jing-Jin-Ji, the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. The analyses are based on classification of optical satellite imagery (Landsat TM/ETM+ and HJ- 1 A/B) over the past two decades. The images were first co-registered and mosaicked, whereupon GLCM texture features were generated and tasseled cap transformations performed to improve class separabilities. The mosaics were classified with a pixel-based SVM and a random forest decision tree ensemble classifier. Based on the classification results, two urbanization indices were derived that indicate both the absolute amount of urban land and the speed of urban development. The spatial composition and configuration of the landscape was analysed by landscape metrics. Environmental impacts were quantified by attributing ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>values</b> to the classifications and the observation of value changes over time. ivThe results from the comparative study between Shanghai and Stockholm show a decrease in all natural land-cover classes and agricultural areas, whereas urban areas increased by approximately 120 % in Shanghai, nearly ten times as much as in Stockholm where no significant land-cover changes other than a 12 % urban expansion could be observed. From the landscape metrics analysis results, it appears that fragmentation in both study regions occurred mainly due to the growth of high density built-up areas in previously more natural environments, while the expansion of low density built-up areas was for the most part in conjunction with pre-existing patches. Urban growth resulted <b>in</b> ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>value</b> losses of ca. 445 million US dollars in Shanghai, mostly due to a decrease in natural coastal wetlands. In Stockholm, a 4 million US dollar increase <b>in</b> ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>values</b> could be observed that {{can be explained by the}} maintenance and development of urban green spaces. Total urban growth in Shanghai was 1, 768 km 2 compared to 100 km 2 in Stockholm. Regarding the comparative study of urbanization in the three Chinese regions, a total increase in urban land of about 28, 000 km 2 could be detected with a simultaneous decrease <b>in</b> ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>values</b> corresponding to ca. 18. 5 billion Chinese Yuan Renminbi. The speed and relative urban growth in Jing-Jin-Ji was highest, followed by the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta. The increase in urban land occurred predominately at the expense of cropland. Wetlands decreased due to land reclamation in all study areas. An increase in landscape complexity in terms of land-cover composition and configuration could be detected. Urban growth in Jing-Jin-Ji contributed most to the decrease <b>in</b> ecosystem <b>service</b> <b>values,</b> closely followed by the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta.
