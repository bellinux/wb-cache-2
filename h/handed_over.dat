When the letters of HAND and FIST are assigned their aphabetical values (a= 1, b= 2 etc.) HAND (8 + 1 + 14 + 4) = 27 and FIST (6 + 9 + 19 + 20) = 54.

5000|$|After {{cards are}} dealt, the scum must <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his best two cards to the president, while the vice-scum must <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> his best card to the vice-president. Variations {{with more than}} two top and two bottom {{positions}} sometimes require the scum to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> more than two cards to the president, up {{to the number of}} top positions in the game. For example, a game with a secretary and clerk might call for the scum to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> three cards to the president, the vice-scum to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> two cards to the vice-president and the clerk to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> one card to the secretary. In any event, the players who receive cards from the bottom positions always hand back an equal number of any [...] "junk" [...] cards they do not want. They are not obliged to pass back their [...] cards, but often do.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results from a Human-Robot Interaction study that investigates the issues of participants’ preferences {{in terms of the}} robot approach direction (directionRAD), robot base approach interaction distance (distanceRBAID), robot <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> <b>hand</b> distance (distanceRHOHD), robot <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> arm gesture (gestureRHOAG), and the coordination of both the robot approaching and gestureRHOAG {{in the context of a}} robot <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> an object to a seated person. The results from this study aim at informing the development of a Human Aware Manipulation Planner. Twelve participants with some previous human-robot interaction experience were recruited for the trial. The results show that a majority of the participants prefer the robot to approach from the front and hand them a can of soft drink in the front sector of their personal zone. The robot <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> <b>hand</b> position had the most influence on determining from where the robot should approach (i. e distanceRAD). Legibility and perception of risk seem to be the deciding factor on how participants choose their preferred robot arm-base approach coordination for <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> a can. Detailed discussions of the results conclude the paper...|$|R
