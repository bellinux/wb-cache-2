50|$|<b>Gusperimus</b> {{is used in}} {{therapeutic}} cycles. The {{daily dose}} {{and the length of}} each cycle as well as the length of the treatment free interval depend on the degree of leukopenia/neutropenia caused by <b>gusperimus.</b> It is recommended to obtain complete WBC (White Blood Cell) counts during and after each cycle frequently.|$|E
50|$|The European Commission {{assigned}} {{orphan drug}} status to <b>Gusperimus</b> in 2001 {{for the treatment}} of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, a serious form of vasculitis frequently associated with permanent disability and/or fatal outcome. There have been many cases of patients resistant to all forms of usual treatment responding very well to <b>Gusperimus.</b>|$|E
50|$|There {{is little}} {{information}} about the pharmacokinetic properties of <b>gusperimus.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Gusperimus</b> was {{developed}} by Bristol-Myers Squibb. Currently, it is manufactured and sponsored for use as an orphan drug and for clinical studies by the Japanese company Euro Nippon Kayaku. The patent claim (see quotation) is that <b>Gusperimus</b> may be useful {{for a variety of}} hyperreactive inflammatory diseases such as autoimmune diseases. The drug is available in vials containing 100 mg each.|$|E
50|$|Reaction {{with the}} glyoxilamide from spermidine (shown as its hydrate) leads to {{displacement}} {{of one of}} the hydroxyl groups and formation of the corresponding carbinolamine, <b>gusperimus.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Gusperimus</b> may {{possibly}} {{be of use}} in more common diseases and conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn's disease, lupus erythematosus, and the prevention and therapy of transplant rejection or graft-versus-host disease.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not known}} if therapy with <b>gusperimus</b> may {{increase}} the risk of malignant diseases (lymphoma, leukemia, solid tumors), {{as is the case with}} other highly potent immunosuppressant agents such as ciclosporin or tacrolimus.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gusperimus</b> is an {{immunosuppressive}} drug. It is {{a derivative}} of the antitumor antibiotic spergualin, and inhibits the interleukin-2-stimulated maturation of T cells to the S and G2/M phases and the polarization of the T cells into IFN-gamma-secreting Th1 effector T cells, {{resulting in the}} inhibition of growth of activated naive CD4 T cells.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that <b>gusperimus</b> may benefit patients with the neurological disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS or Lou Gehrig's disease). ALS causes permanent motor deficits and disabilities {{up to the point}} that almost all motor functions, including breathing and bladder control, are lost. Patients usually have no intellectual impairments. Currently, there are no results from controlled studies in ALS patients.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Type 1 {{diabetes}} mellitus is a chronic metabolic disease caused by autoimmune destruction of pancreatic beta cells. The {{theory of the}} disease onset is derived from study of a disease course in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, in which the diabetes occurs due to a dysregulation of the immune system. Experimental and clinical studies showed that the autoimmunity may be abrogated by immune intervention, which if initiated early enough may at least slow down the ongoing beta cells lost and preserve residual insulin secretion. But immune intervention alone {{is not sufficient to}} restore normoglycemia in the majority of cases. Several interventional studies showed that stimulation of proliferation and/or regeneration of beta cells are necessary to restore normoglycemia in animal models. Aim of the study: To find out, if the combination of a potent immunosuppression (murine anti-thymocyte globulin (mATG), <b>gusperimus)</b> together with stimulation of islet regeneration (sitagliptin) will be able to slow down or reverse the course of the disease. Another aim is to identify the mechanism by which the substances act. Material and methods: All experiments were performed in female NODShiLtJ (H 2 g 7) mice. The following parameters were examined at day 0, 7, 14 and 28 : blood glucose, subpopulations of [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The {{therapy for}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) {{has changed dramatically}} over the past decade. Recent immunobiological findings and current pathophysiological concepts together with advances in biotechnology, improvements in clinical trial design and development of magnetic resonance imaging {{have led to a}} variety of evaluable therapeutic approaches in MS. However, in contrast to the successfully introduced and established immunomodulatory therapies (e. g. interferon-beta and glatiramer acetate), there have been a remarkable number of therapeutic failures as well. Despite convincing immunological concepts, impressive data from animal models and promising results from phase I/II studies, the drugs and strategies investigated showed no benefit or even turned out to have unexpectedly severe adverse effects. Although to date there is no uniformly accepted model for MS, there is agreement on the significance of inflammatory events mediated by autoreactive T cells in the CNS. These can be modified therapeutically at the individual steps of a hypothetical pathogenetic cascade. Crucial corners like: (i) the prevalence and peripheral activation of CNS-autoreactive T cells in the periphery; (ii) adhesion and penetration of T cells into the CNS; (iii) local activation and proliferation and; (iv) de- and remyelination processes can be targeted through their putative mediators. Like a 'specificity pyramid', therapeutic approaches therefore cover from general immunosuppression up to specific targeting of T-cell receptor peptide major histocompatibility (MHC) complex. We discuss in detail clinical MS trials that failed or were discontinued for other reasons. These trials include cytokine modulators [tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha antagonists, interleukin- 10, interleukin- 4, transforming growth factor-beta 2], immunosuppressive agents (roquininex, <b>gusperimus,</b> sulfasalazine, cladribine), inducers of remyelination [intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) ], antigen- derived therapies [oral tolerance, altered peptide ligands (APL), MHC-Peptide blockade], T cell and T-cell receptor directed therapies (T cell vaccination, T-cell receptor peptide vaccination), monoclonal antibodies against leucocyte differentiation molecules (anti-CD 3, anti-CD 4), and inactivation of circulating T cells (extracorporeal photopheresis). The main conclusions that can be drawn from these 'negative' experiences Lire as follows. Theoretically promising agents may paradoxically increase disease activity (lenercept, inflixiniab), be associated with unforeseen adverse effects (e. g. roquinimex) or short-term favourable trends may reverse with prolonged follow-up (e. g. sulfasalzine). One should not be too enthusiastic about successful trials in animal models (TNFalpha blockers; oral tolerance; remyelinating effect of IVIg) nor be irritated by non-scientific media hype (deoxyspergualine; bone marrow transplantation). More selectivity can imply less efficacy (APL, superselective interventions like T-cell receptor vaccination) and antigen- related therapies can stimulate rather than inhibit encephalitogenic cells. Failed strategies are of high importance for a critical revision of assumed immunopathological mechanisms, their neuroimaging correlates, and for future trial design. Since failed trials add to our growing understanding of multiple sclerosis, 'misses' are nearly as important to the scientific process as the 'hits'...|$|E
