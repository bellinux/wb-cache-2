She states that 3 themes throughout the books are widely predominant '1) the value of tolerance and respect for difference; 2) opposition to violence and punitiveness; and 3) the dangers of authoritarianism.' She suggests that these themes are also present {{in the presidential election}} and it may {{play a significant role in}} <b>how</b> <b>Americans</b> have responded to the campaign.|$|E

25|$|By 1786, {{the church}} had succeeded in {{translating}} episcopacy to America and in revising the Book of Common Prayer to reflect American political realities.

25|$|In 1776, the Thirteen Colonies, acting {{through the}} Second Continental Congress, {{declared}} political independence from Great Britain during the American Revolution. The new states, though independent {{of each other}} as nation states, recognized the necessity of closely coordinating their efforts against the British. Desiring to avoid anything that remotely resembled a monarchy, Congress negotiated the Articles of Confederation to establish an alliance between the states. As a central authority, Congress under the Articles was without any legislative power; it could make its own resolutions, determinations, and regulations, but not any laws, nor any taxes or local commercial regulations enforceable upon citizens. This institutional design reflected <b>how</b> <b>Americans</b> believed the deposed British system of Crown and Parliament ought to have functioned {{with respect to the}} royal dominion: a superintending body for matters that concerned the entire empire. Out from under any monarchy, the states assigned some formerly royal prerogatives (e.g., making war, receiving ambassadors, etc.) to Congress, while severally lodging the rest within their own respective state governments. Only after all the states agreed to a resolution settling competing western land claims did the Articles take effect on March 1, 1781, when Maryland became the final state to ratify them.|$|E
500|$|Bush {{appeared}} on NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno on November 19, 2013, {{along with the}} former First Lady, Laura Bush. When asked by Leno why he does not comment publicly about the Obama administration, Bush said, [...] "I don't think it's {{good for the country}} to have a former president criticize his successor." [...] Despite this statement, on Saturday, April 25, 2015, Bush criticized President Barack Obama {{at a meeting of the}} Republican Jewish Coalition at the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas. Bush criticized Obama's handling of Iran, specifically with respect to sanctions and a nuclear deal, saying: [...] "You think the Middle East is chaotic now? Imagine what it looks like for our grandchildren. That's <b>how</b> <b>Americans</b> should view the deal." [...] Bush also attacked Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq in 2011, calling it a [...] "strategic blunder", borrowing a term that had been used by South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.|$|E
500|$|The 1960s was {{a tumultuous}} {{era in the}} United States, and public {{interest}} in civil liberties underwent an explosive growth. Civil liberties actions in the 1960s were often led by young people, and often employed tactics such as sit ins and marches. Protests were often peaceful, but sometimes employed militant tactics. The ACLU {{played a central role}} in all major civil liberties debates of the 1960s, including new fields such as gay rights, prisoner's rights, abortion, rights of the poor, and the death penalty. Membership in the ACLU increased from 52,000 at the beginning of the decade, to 104,000 in 1970. In 1960, there were affiliates in seven states, and by 1974 there were affiliates in 46 states. During the 1960s, the ACLU underwent a major transformation tactics; it shifted emphasis from legal appeals (generally involving amicus briefs submitted to the Supreme Court) to direct representation of defendants when they were initially arrested. At the same time, the ACLU transformed its style from [...] "disengaged and elitist" [...] to [...] "emotionally engaged". The ACLU published a breakthrough document in 1963, titled <b>How</b> <b>Americans</b> Protest, which was borne of frustration with the slow progress in battling racism, and which endorsed aggressive, even militant protest techniques.|$|E

500|$|Meyer {{moved to}} Boulder, Colorado because he [...] "just {{wanted to get}} {{as far from the}} New York {{environment}} as [...] could." [...] There, he wrote a film script for Letterman; the project was dropped due to the success of Letterman's show, although several of its jokes were later used in The Simpsons when no other ideas could be found. He spent time [...] "skiing, going to poetry readings, and trying to meet girls from the University of Colorado." [...] He founded the humor zine Army Man; he wrote the eight-page first issue almost wholly by himself, publishing just 200 copies which he gave to his friends. Meyer had been disappointed by the decline of the National Lampoon and felt that there was no longer a magazine which has the sole purpose of being funny. By starting Army Man he [...] "tried to make something that had no agenda other than to make you laugh." [...] He claimed that [...] " [...] didn't know what [...] was doing," [...] and reprinted material without obtaining permission, including a review of Cannonball Run II. He added: [...] "I like to think that Army Man was somewhere between a real publication and a very irresponsible, lawbreaking zine." [...] Army Man gained a strong following and was listed on Rolling Stones [...] "Hot List" [...] in 1989. Meyer noted: [...] "The only rule was that the stuff had to be funny and pretty short. To me, the quintessential Army Man joke was one of John Swartzwelder's: 'They can kill the Kennedys. Why can't they make a cup of coffee that tastes good?' It's a horrifying idea juxtaposed with something really banal-and yet there's a kind of logic to it. It's illuminating because it's kind of <b>how</b> <b>Americans</b> see things: Life's a big jumble, but somehow it leads to something I can consume. I love that." [...] Meyer suspended publication with the third issue, after offers to take the magazine national made him fear that it would lose its best qualities. According to The Believer: [...] "In comedy circles, [...] taken on almost mythological proportions." [...] This was met with varying reactions from Meyer, who felt [...] "embarrassed when people build it up as this monumental work of comedy. It was just a silly little escapade, never meant to be enshrined." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tucker's Blackstone sold {{well from}} the beginning, and {{it quickly became}} the major {{treatise}} on American law in the early 19th century. Law reporter Daniel Call described it as [...] "necessary to every student and practitioner of law in Virginia". Lawyers arguing before the Supreme Court of the United States would frequently cite to Tucker's Blackstone - more often than any other commentator until 1827. The U.S. Supreme Court itself cited Tucker's Blackstone frequently, referring to it in over forty cases, many of them significant. Modern lawyers, legal scholars, and judges still refer to this work as an important tool for determining <b>how</b> <b>Americans</b> understood both English and American law {{in the early days}} after the United States's independence.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1996, PC Graphics Report {{interviewed a}} Japanese {{executive}} associated with Bandai.

In particular, computer illiterate people did not know what an [...] "@" [...] sign was, as in @WORLD. Consumers in America could not grasp the idea of surfing the Internet using such a device. The executive could not understand <b>how</b> <b>Americans</b> might not be interested in surfing the Internet. Even among internet surfers, the Apple Pippin was not necessarily the console of choice. A July 1996 article in Electronic Gaming Monthly pointed out that the competing Sega Saturn and its separately sold Netlink device combined still cost under $400, making it a far less expensive internet option than the Pippin. And, any device that wasn't simple to use would be a failure in the U.S. market.|$|E
2500|$|Striking, pushing, pulling, pinching, kicking, {{strangling}} and {{hand-to-hand fighting}} are forms of touch {{in the context}} of physical abuse. In a sentence like [...] "I never touched him/her" [...] or [...] "Don't you dare to touch him/her" [...] the term touch may be meant as euphemism for either physical abuse or sexual touching. [...] The word touch has many other metaphorical uses. One can be emotionally touched, referring to an action or object that evokes an emotional response. To say [...] "I was touched by your letter" [...] implies the reader felt a strong emotion when reading it. It usually does not include anger, disgust or other forms of emotional rejection unless used in a sarcastic manner. Stoeltje (2003) wrote about <b>how</b> <b>Americans</b> are ‘losing touch’ with this important communication skill. During a study conducted by University of Miami School of Medicine, Touch Research Institutes, American children were said to be more aggressive than their French counterparts while playing at a playground. It was noted that French women touched their children more often than the American parents.|$|E
