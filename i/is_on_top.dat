25|$|The lantern {{at the top}} of the Medici Chapel is {{made out}} of marble and has an “….unusual {{polyhedron}} mounted on the peak of the conical roof,”. The orb that <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the lantern has seventy-two facets and is about two feet in diameter. The orb and cross, that <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the orb, are traditional symbols of the Roman and Christian power, and recalls the similar orbs on central dome plan churches like St. Maria del Fiore and St. Peter’s. But because it is on a private mausoleum, the Medici family is promoting their own personal power with the orb and cross, laurel wreath and lion heads, which are all symbols of status and power.|$|E

While immersed plane curves, up to regular homotopy, are determined by their turning number, knots have a very rich and complex structure.|$|E

25|$|In an {{intervening}} {{phase in}} volcanism predominantly sediments were deposited. Yarralumla Formation {{was named after}} the suburb of Yarralumla by Öpik in 1958. It consists mainly of mudstone which may be cemented by lime, or originally derived from tuff. There are some beds inserted of quartz sandstone or limestone. The bottom of the formation <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the Mount Painter Volcanics. The top of the formation grades up into pyroclastics from the Deakin Volcanics.|$|E
25|$|Letters {{are formed}} by a {{dominant}} hand, which <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of or alongside {{the other hand}} {{at the point of}} contact, and a subordinate hand, which uses either the same or a simpler handshape as the dominant hand. Either the left or right hand can be dominant.

25|$|Depending on the {{location}} of the camshaft, the cam operates the valves either directly or through a linkage of pushrods and rockers. Direct operation involves a simpler mechanism and leads to fewer failures, but requires the camshaft to be positioned {{at the top of the}} cylinders. In the past when engines were not as reliable as today this was seen as too much trouble, but in modern gasoline engines the overhead cam system, where the camshaft <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the cylinder head, is quite common.|$|E

25|$|The gimbal {{was first}} {{described}} by the Greek inventor Philo of Byzantium (280–220 BCE). Philo described an eight-sided ink pot with an opening on each side, which can be turned so that while any face <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top,</b> a pen can be dipped and inked — yet the ink never runs out through the holes of the other sides. This {{was done by the}} suspension of the inkwell at the center, which was mounted on a series of concentric metal rings so that it remained stationary no matter which way the pot is turned.|$|E
25|$|NEMA wall {{receptacles}} can {{be found}} installed in any orientation. Neither NEMA nor the US National Electrical Code nor the Canadian Electrical Code specify a preferred orientation, but the National Electrical Contractors Association's National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) specify that the preferred location of the ground <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top.</b> When the ground blade of a receptacle is on the bottom, the neutral blade is on the upper left and the hot blade is on the upper right. All descriptions below assume this orientation (i.e. clockwise order is ground, neutral, hot for 120V receptacle versions; and counter-clockwise for plug versions).|$|E
25|$|The {{flags of}} Japan and Bangladesh {{both have a}} red circle {{in the middle of}} {{different}} colored backgrounds. The flag of the Philippines has a red trapezoid on the bottom signifying blood, courage, and valor (also, if the flag is inverted so that the red trapezoid <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> and the blue at the bottom, it indicates a state of war). The flag of Singapore has a red rectangle on the top. The field of the flag of Portugal is green and red. The Ottoman Empire adopted several different red flags during the six centuries of its rule, with the successor Republic of Turkey continuing the 1844 Ottoman Flag.|$|E

25|$|In March 2017, Beijing saw over 200,000 dockless shared bikes {{from various}} {{companies}} entered service. Near {{the end of}} 2017 it has grown to 2.35 million for-hire bikes from 15 companies. The bikes are accessible via an app, and cost 1 RMB per hour plus a refundable damage deposit of 299 RMB. This <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of the existing municipal run dock based bike network with 86,000 bikes. The Beijing municipal government has pledged to improve management and parking availability {{in response to the}} rapidly growing fleets of dockless bikes shares. Beijing cycling mode share increased from 5.5% to 11.6% after the arrival of these dockless bike systems.|$|E
25|$|The 5-15 socket is {{standard}} in Canada, the United States, Mexico and Panama. It {{is also used}} in Central America, the Caribbean, northern South America (Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela and, as a legacy, parts of Brazil), Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Saudi Arabia. This socket is recommended in IEC standard 60906-2 for 120 volt 60Hz installations. Looking directly at a NEMA 5-15 socket in the commonly found orientation of ground (earth) at the bottom, the neutral slot is on the left, and the line slot is on the right. However, in the US the National Electrical Installation Standards (NECA 130-2010) specifies that the ground hole should be on top. Sideways installation is also permitted; in this case, NECA 130-2010 specifies the neutral (long) slot <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top.</b>|$|E
25|$|This marble obelisk <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of {{a square}} base with three reliefs on it. The {{south side of}} the base has a relief of Benjamin Grenup {{at the time of his}} death. The relief shows Grenup being run over by a fire water wagon and his fellow firefighters {{reacting}} to the accidental death—one has his arms in the air while the other firefighters stop the wagon. The west side of the base has a relief of a fire hose and two nozzles. The east side has a relief of a fire axe, torch and spanner wrench tied together with a rope. Egg-and-dart motif along with garland and ribbons decorate the sculpture. The sculpture sits on a triangle plot surrounded by a fence. Fire hydrants sit at each of the three corners of the base.|$|E

25|$|One {{thing that}} is {{different}} about the Basilica of Our Lady of Piat was its entrance arch. It was {{at the back of}} the church and one has to go around from the entrance to see the church façade. The arch has the phrase, Basilica Minore Nuestra Señora de Piat (Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Piat). Our Lady of Piat Basilica sports a simple facade flanked with a tall belfry. It <b>is</b> <b>on</b> <b>top</b> of a hill in the midst of Cagayan River with the intention of avoiding floods brought about by the seasonal overflowing of the river. The church structure is mainly made of red bricks, which is common among churches in Cagayan Valley. It is a contrast to old churches made of limestone and coral stone in many parts of the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{very large and}} high, and is {{somewhat}} falcate (sickle-shaped); it originates over the bases of the pectoral fins. The second dorsal fin is much smaller, but similar in shape, and originates over the rear tips of the pelvic fins. Both dorsal fins bear stout spines on their leading edges. The pectoral fins are large; the pelvic fins are {{much smaller than the}} first dorsal fin. The anal fin is placed well in front of the caudal fin, which is broad with a short lower lobe and a long upper lobe bearing a strong ventral notch near the tip. The dermal denticles are large and rough, particularly {{on the sides of the}} body. The coloration is light brown, with a series of diffuse-edged, darker wide bands interspersed with narrower stripes from snout to tail, numbering 1114 in all.
