We discuss a compositional approach for specifying concurrent behavior of components with <b>data</b> <b>states</b> on the basis of interface theories. The dynamic aspects of a system are specified by modal I/O-transition systems, whereas changes of <b>data</b> <b>states</b> are specified by pre- and postconditions. In this setting we study refinement and behavioral compatibility of components. We show that refinement is compositional and that compatibility is preserved by refinement; thus the requirements for interface theories are satisfied. As a consequence, our approach supports independent implementability and reusability of concurrently interacting components with <b>data</b> <b>states.</b> 1...|$|R

50|$|A {{transaction}} is {{a logical}} unit of processing delimited by BeginTransaction and CommitTransaction, or Rollback, operations. All updates performed during a transaction are atomic; they either all appear in the database {{at the same time}} or none appear. Any subsequent updates by other transactions are invisible to a transaction. However, a transaction can update only data that has not changed in the meantime; else the operation fails at once without waiting. Read-only transactions never need to wait, and update transactions can interfere only with one another updating transaction. Transactions which are terminated by Rollback, or by a system crash, leave no trace on the database. In general, the <b>data</b> <b>state</b> is restored on Rollback to what it was prior to BeginTransaction.|$|E

50|$|While {{the use of}} {{protocol}} layering {{is today}} ubiquitous across the field of computer networking, it has been historically criticized by many researchers for two principal reasons. Firstly, abstracting the protocol stack in this way may cause a higher layer to duplicate functionality of a lower layer, a prime example being error recovery on both a per-link basis and an end-to-end basis. Secondly, it is common that a protocol implementation at one layer may require <b>data,</b> <b>state</b> or addressing information that is only present at another layer, thus defeating the point of separating the layers in the first place. For example, TCP uses the ECN field in the IPv4 header {{as an indication of}} congestion; IP is a network layer protocol whereas TCP is a transport layer protocol.|$|E
50|$|Transaction {{operations}} are logged and the log is flushed to disk during each commit to transaction level 0. This allows {{the recovery process}} to redo updates made by transactions which commit to transaction level 0, and undo changes made by transactions which did not commit to transaction level 0. This type of recovery scheme {{is often referred to}} as a ‘roll-forward/roll-backward’ recovery scheme. Logs can be retained until the data is safely copied via a backup process described below, or logs can be reused in a circular fashion as soon as they are no longer needed for recovery from system crash. Circular logging minimizes the amount of disk space needed for the log but has implications on the ability to recreate a <b>data</b> <b>state</b> in the event of a media failure.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{present a}} {{compositional}} approach for specifying concurrent behavior of components with <b>data</b> <b>states</b> {{on the basis}} of interface theories. The dynamic aspects of a system are specified by modal input/output automata, whereas changing <b>data</b> <b>states</b> are specified by pre- and postconditions. The combination of the two formalisms leads to our notion of modal input/output automata with data constraints (MIODs). In this setting we study refinement and behavioral compatibility of MIODs. We show that compatibility is preserved by refinement and that refinement is compositional w. r. t.  synchronous composition, thus satisfying basic requirements of an interface theory. We propose a semantic foundation of interface specifications where any MIOD is equipped with a model-theoretic semantics describing the class of its correct implementation models. Implementation models are formalized in terms of guarded input/output transition systems and the correctness notion is based on a simulation relation between an MIOD and an implementation model which relates not only abstract and concrete control states but also (abstract) data constraints and concrete <b>data</b> <b>states.</b> We show that our approach is compositional in the sense that locally correct implementation models of compatible MIODs compose to globally correct implementations, thus ensuring independent implementability...|$|R

50|$|SOA {{promises}} to simplify testing indirectly. Services are autonomous, stateless, with fully documented interfaces, and {{separate from the}} cross-cutting concerns of the implementation. If an organization possesses appropriately defined test data, then a corresponding stub is built that reacts to the test data when a service is being built. A full set of regression tests, scripts, data, and responses is also captured for the service. The service can be tested as a 'black box' using existing stubs corresponding to the services it calls. Test environments can be constructed where the primitive and out-of-scope services are stubs, while {{the remainder of the}} mesh is test deployments of full services. As each interface is fully documented with its own full set of regression test documentation, it becomes simple to identify problems in test services. Testing evolves to merely validate that the test service operates according to its documentation, and finds gaps in documentation and test cases of all services within the environment. Managing the <b>data</b> <b>state</b> of idempotent services is the only complexity.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a class of}} programmable devices that can discriminate between two quantum states. We consider two cases. In the first, both states are unknown. One copy {{of each of the}} unknown states is provided as input, or program, for the two program registers, and the <b>data</b> <b>state,</b> which is guaranteed to be prepared in one of the program states, is fed into the data register of the device. This device will then tell us, in an optimal way, which of the templates stored in the program registers the <b>data</b> <b>state</b> matches. In the second case, we know one of the states while the other is unknown. One copy of the unknown state is fed into the single program register, and the <b>data</b> <b>state</b> which is guaranteed to be prepared in either the program state or the known state, is fed into the data register. The device will then tell us, again optimally, whether the <b>data</b> <b>state</b> matches the template or is the known state. We determine two types of optimal devices. The first performs discrimination with minimum error, the second performs optimal unambiguous discrimination. In all cases we first treat the simpler problem of only one copy of the <b>data</b> <b>state</b> and then generalize the treatment to n copies. In comparison to other works we find that providing n > 1 copies of the <b>data</b> <b>state</b> yields higher success probabilities than providing n > 1 copies of the program states.
