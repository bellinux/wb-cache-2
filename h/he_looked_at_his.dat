500|$|In 1999, The New York Times {{reported}} that Jesse Ventura first approached Trump {{about a possible}} 2000 presidential run while both were in attendance at a wrestling event in Atlantic City. [...] Trump's ambitions may have spawned earlier. The America We Deserve co-writer Dave Shiflett said Trump first thought about running in late 1998, when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> political advantages in money and name recognition, and concluded that he was [...] "at least as competent" [...] as then President Bill Clinton. According to Shiflett, this prompted Trump to ask top aide Roger Stone to find the [...] "most eminent hack writer in America" [...] to put Trump's political ideas into a book. [...] Stone reached out to Shiflett, a contributor to The American Spectator. In spring 1999, Shiflett met with Trump about the project that would later become The America We Deserve. [...] During the initial meeting, Shiflett claims Trump raised concerns about a suitcase bomb destroying Manhattan.|$|E
2500|$|Captain Joseph Hazelwood, who {{was widely}} {{reported}} to have been drinking heavily that night, {{was not at the}} controls when the ship struck the reef. However, as the senior officer, he was in command of the ship even though he was asleep in his bunk. In light of the other findings, investigative reporter Greg Palast stated in 2008, [...] "Forget the drunken skipper fable. As to Captain Joe Hazelwood, he was below decks, sleeping off his bender. At the helm, the third mate never would have collided with Bligh Reef had <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> RAYCAS radar. But the radar was not turned on. In fact, the tanker's radar was left broken and disabled {{for more than a year}} before the disaster, and Exxon management knew it. It was just too expensive to fix and operate." [...] Exxon blamed Captain Hazelwood for the grounding of the tanker.|$|E
2500|$|In 1887, prematurely {{gray and}} badly ailing, Holliday {{made his way}} to the Hotel Glenwood, near the hot springs of Glenwood Springs, Colorado. [...] He hoped to take {{advantage}} of the reputed curative power of the waters, but the sulfurous fumes from the spring may have done his lungs more harm than good. As he lay dying, Holliday is reported to have asked the nurse attending him for a shot of whiskey. When she told him no, <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> bootless feet, amused. The nurses said that his last words were, [...] "This is funny." [...] He always figured he would be killed someday with his boots on. Holliday died at 10am on November 8, 1887. He was 36. [...] Wyatt Earp did not learn of Holliday's death until two months afterward. Horony later said that she attended to him in his final days, and one contemporary source appears to back her claim.|$|E
6000|$|... "Janet," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch, [...] "if Mr Gresham and Mr Frank call, {{show them}} into my study. What {{are you going}} to do with yourself, my dear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Or {{without your}} making any {{exertion}} to save them, Mrs. Dolly," [...] answered Archibald drily.--"But I am surprised {{we do not}} hear the bell yet," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> watch.|$|R
50|$|If {{the dealer}} expose {{any of his}} own cards the deal stands good. If he expose any of his adversary's cards, the non-dealer, before <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hand, may claim a fresh deal.|$|R
2500|$|Rubin first {{conceived}} of the dating aspect for the film, [...] "being {{able to use}} your superior knowledge to pick up women", {{which led to the}} film to lean more into the comedy side. He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but that had little fanfare, which the film could be played annually similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman. Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and [...] "rules" [...] for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.|$|E
2500|$|The album's themes include {{mortality}} and growing older, or, as Taylor described it, [...] "just realizing, 'I'm not {{as young as}} I used to be, what am I {{going to do with}} myself? I don't have eternity to stay here so I need to get up and do something and make it worthwhile'—whatever that means." [...] Pierre's lyricism includes a mix of fact and fiction, which is intended to leave the listener guessing. The album's tone is reflective, which was spurred from Pierre having time to sit at home to write and think. <b>He</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> relationship with lead guitarist Joshua Cain, noting that the two had written and played music together for 15 years at that point. Pierre felt [...] "overwhelmed with the eventual demise of everything," [...] and considered the fact that [...] "nothing lasts forever" [...] is one of the album's most important points. Occasionally, Pierre's lyricism was considered too personal or dark by other members. One lyric from [...] "Timelines", paraphrased by Pierre in an interview as [...] "rushing into every pore, the whiskey stench of open sores", was changed to [...] "scattered seeds of sycamore," [...] as Cain found the lyric gross, noting it [...] "literally made [...] stomach sick." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike his {{previous}} postings at Aldershot and Osnabrück, while stationed in Aden, Nilsen {{had his own}} room. This afforded him the privacy to masturbate without discovery. His developed fantasies of sex with an unresistant or deceased partner unfulfilled, Nilsen compensated by imagining sexual encounters with an unconscious body as he masturbated as <b>he</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> own prone, nude body in a mirror. On one occasion, Nilsen discovered that, by using a free-standing mirror, he could create an effect whereby if positioning the mirror so his head was out of view, he could visualise himself engaged in a sexual act with another man. To Nilsen, this ruse created the ideal circumstance in which he could visually [...] "split" [...] his personality: in these masturbatory fantasies, Nilsen alternately envisaged himself as being both the domineering and the passive partner. These fantasies gradually evolved to incorporate his own near-death experience with the Arab taxi driver, the dead bodies {{he had seen in}} Aden, and imagery within a 19th-century oil painting entitled The Raft of the Medusa, which depicted an old man holding the limp, nude body of a deceased youth as he sat aside the dismembered body of another young male. In his most vividly recalled fantasy, a slender, attractive young blonde soldier who had been recently killed in battle would be dominated by a faceless [...] "dirty, grey-haired old man" [...] who would wash the body before engaging in intercourse with the spreadeagled corpse.|$|E

50|$|If {{the dealer}} turn {{up more than}} one card, the non-dealer, before <b>he</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> hand, may choose which of the exposed cards shall be the trump, or may claim a fresh deal.

50|$|A nobleman {{who is both}} Liselsia's {{father and}} a famous Fortelle player. <b>He</b> <b>looks</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> daughter's efforts in singing with great disdain and frustration, and this has {{resulted}} in him employing rather drastic means to force his daughter to follow in his footsteps.|$|R

5000|$|The {{scene in}} which Wesley has phone sex with Lilah was written by creator Joss Whedon when the episode came in short. Actor Alexis Denisof, who plays Wesley, {{explains}} that throughout this season his character is [...] "flirting with and investigating {{the dark side of}} himself. <b>He's</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> relationships with all the people and with Angel, and <b>he's</b> definitely <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>his</b> whole purpose {{and trying to figure out}} how he wants to be.
