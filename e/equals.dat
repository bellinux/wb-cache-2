40|$|We {{introduce}} the polynomial time version, in short {{less than or}} <b>equal</b> to(T) (P) -introreducibility, {{of the notion of}} introreducibility studied in Recursion Theory. We give a simpler proof of the known fact that a set is less than or <b>equal</b> to(T) (P) -introreducible if and only if it is in P. Our proof generalizes to virtually all the computation bounded reducibilities less than or <b>equal</b> to(r), showing that a set is less than or <b>equal</b> to(r) -introreducible if and only if it belongs to the minimum less than or <b>equal</b> to(r) -degree. It also holds for most unbounded reducibilities like less than or <b>equal</b> to(m), less than or <b>equal</b> to(c), less than or <b>equal</b> to(d), less than or <b>equal</b> to(p), less than or <b>equal</b> to(tt), etc., but it does not hold for less than or <b>equal</b> to(T). A very strong way for a set L to fail being less than or <b>equal</b> to(r) -introreducible is that L is not less than or <b>equal</b> to(r) -reducible to any coinfinite subset of L. We call such sets less than or <b>equal</b> to(r) -introimmune. It is known that less than or <b>equal</b> to(T) -introimmune sets exist but they are not arithmetical. In this paper we ask for which reducibilities less than or <b>equal</b> to(r) there exist arithmetical less than or <b>equal</b> to(r) -introimmune sets. We show that they exist for the reducibilities less than or <b>equal</b> to(c) and less than or <b>equal</b> to(m) (N). Finally, we prove separation results between introimmunities...|$|R
