Ask for his or her name. • Get the correct spelling and pronunciation if you plan to use the name in your story. 5. Listen. • Interviews can go in a different direction than the one you planned. Go with the flow. Listen for cues to interesting questions and ask follow-up questions. If you hear something you want to know more about, ask the interviewee to tell you more. 6. Make eye contact. • Don’t stare at your questions. Glance down occasionally to keep things flowing, but also engage your interviewee. This makes him or her feel more comfortable, and usually results in better answers. 7. Take notes. • Make a note of items you’d like to use in your piece so you remember where they are later. 8. Leave personal biases at the door. • Your job is to be objective and capture the interviewee’s point of view. If you ask inappropriate questions or make the person feel uncomfortable, your subject won’t be as open with you as they could be. 9. Record interesting background noise. • Make sure the sounds fit with the story. If you’re interviewing someone about the health effects of working in an office, record some office sounds, such as the person checking e-mail, rifling through papers or answering the phone. 10. Say thank you. • Send your interviewee a note thanking him or her for the interview. Be courteous. Think of everyone you talk to as a contact you may need in the future...|$|E
40|$|This {{scenario}} {{highlights the}} mismatch of expectations that can arise in a mentoring {{relationship between a}} graduate student and a research adviser. The adviser wants a solely professional relationship, but the student seeks a more personal relationship. Their inconsistent desires lead to inconsistent expectations about how long they should meet and what they should discuss, and subsequently to misunderstandings about the preliminary results. Some {{of the problems in}} this scenario could have been avoided had the adviser and student negotiated mutual expectations and responsibilities when they first began working together. In general, a professor and student should agree on expectations, such as how frequently they would meet, and how quickly the professor would review the student’s draft manuscripts. They should update these expectations periodically. As the student matures from apprentice to colleague, the student should take increasing responsibility for the direction of the research, and the professor should shift from providing technical advice to guiding the student in professional networking and in career preparation. A professor should recognize that different students need different amounts and kinds of guidance at different years of their studies. 	The ideal mentoring relationship is both personal and professional: a mentor is more than an adviser but less than a friend. Besides providing technical and professional advice, a mentor should instruct the student in the norms in the discipline, such as how colleagues should interact with each other, and in the standards of research practice, such as how research data should be managed. A mentor should advocate for the student by recommending the student for fellowships and awards, by introducing the student to researchers at other institutions, and by helping the student find professional employment, including postdoctoral and faculty positions. As in any close interpersonal relationship, conflicts in the mentoring relationship are inevitable. A professor and student may disagree over the inclusion of co-authors on a paper, or over the interpretation of experimental results. Students can feel inhibited from honestly expressing serious disagreements because professors hold great power over their advancement. Rarely can a single professor provide all of the advice that a graduate student needs to develop professionally. The student should therefore find multiple senior mentors. In addition, the student can benefit from the diversity of perspectives of multiple mentors. This role-play scenario illustrates a common situation in which each person starts with only partial information: the professor does not know that the preliminary results were actually only anticipated results, and the student does not know that the professor is annoyed by the student’s lack of focus on technical work. To ensure that each person receives complete information, the professor and student must communicate openly: the student should convey the bad news about the results clearly, and the professor should criticize the student’s behavior constructively. But the situation is risky because each person will be disappointed by the other’s information. To communicate in a risky situation (Patterson et al., 2002), each person should first state the facts and his or her own interpretation of the facts, then invite the other’s interpretation. Each person should use tentative language. Each should listen carefully to the other, asking questions for clarification. The professor might say, “I notice that you are {{spending a lot of time}} organizing social events. (States facts.) I am concerned that you do not seem committed to the research project and developing independence.

40|$|After 12 {{years as}} Director of CTA Daniel Assoumou Mba has now {{completed}} his assignment. From the outset {{he has led}} his institute with discretion and courtesy. During these years the tasks, personnel and budget of the Centre have expanded to create an institute capable of effectively fulfilling its mandate. Mr Assoumou undertook his duties with a rigorous commitment to development and clear-sighted policies. He always insisted that Spore, which {{he was responsible for}} naming, should be a publication oriented towards development information and not a publicity bulletin for CTA. Spore asked Daniel Assoumou Mba about his experiences and his vision for CTA. Spore: You have led CTA since its creation in 1983. With hindsight, {{what do you see as}} the main phases in the Centre's development? D Assoumou Mba: When CTA was established the mandate given to us by Lomé II was very broad: to improve access by ACP countries to information, research and training and also to agricultural development innovations. This was an enormous task! CTA's initial activities in 1983 began from a hotel room in Wageningen. There were only two staff members at the time: a driver-messenger and myself. Within one year eight people were recruited and a programme-budget for the subsequent year was drawn up. Initially the Centre's activities were mainly focused on demonstrating the importance of scientific and technical information (STI) in relation to food security, income generation and natural resource conservation. In other words, that STI should be regarded as an input in agricultural production. We gradually became aware of the constraints that ACP countries have to face in terms of information dissemination: lack of national or regional STI policies, difficulty in accessing information sources and a shortage of human and financial resources. At the same time, it was necessary to identify which groups of agricultural development workers should become our target groups: e. g. planners, researchers, trainers, extension workers and information managers. Based on the requirements expressed by the ACP countries CTA launched its first information dissemination activities through studies, scientific and technical meetings, and publications on research and extension. Spore: What strategies has CTA adopted to accomplish its objectives? D Assoumou Mba: We have been able to establish and maintain close links with organizations involved in agricultural development in ACP countries at all levels: national, regional and international. CTA commissions experts from European Union and ACP countries to carry out specific tasks. The Centre has established regional offices in the Caribbean and the Pacific to improve its effectiveness in those regions. In Africa, we maintain close links with regional economic bodies and research-coordinating institutes. CTA also works closely with ACP national research, training, extension, and information and documentation services. The value of CTA's early work was recognized five years after its establishment. An evaluation of CTA's work during this period was very positive. Spore: What are the Centre's current activities? D Assoumou Mba: The Centre's activities focus on agriculture, including livestock, fishing and forestry; and the socio-economic aspects of any activity are always taken into account. CTA currently serves 70 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries which are divided into six regions. Spore: <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> future beyond Lomé IV? D Assoumou Mba: Lomé IV covers the period 1991 - 2000 and has broadened the Centre's mandate by emphasizing the need to develop capacity in ACP countries. The Convention aims to integrate information within agricultural development strategies and our role is to provide scientific and technical support in the preparation of information programmes. According to the 1994 evaluation of CTA 'the Centre has moved from a position of considerable uncertainy in 1984 to one of growing importance and tangible achievements. The Centre now has an identity and infrastructure, a sound programme and funding base, and a widely recognized contribution to the information needs of ACP countries [...] . '. However, the Centre's role as a catalyst in formulating STI programmes can only bring about major changes if the Centre works to enable ACP countries to ultimately take over CTA's responsibilities and to meet their own agricultural information needs more adequately. CTA's role remains relevant today. However, it will have to put special effort into defining and setting up regional programmes. This is the key to its future success. After 12 years as Director of CTA Daniel Assoumou Mba has now completed his assignment. From the outset he has led his institute with discretion and courtesy.

40|$|Restoring lost land in Cameroon Cue: In much {{of north}} Cameroon the clay soils are very {{sensitive}} to erosion. With the pressure of increased population, fallow periods have shortened and land degradation has become severe. An estimated 30 % of land in the area is degraded, and nearly 20 % has been abandoned. So, in a joint venture, soil scientists and foresters have for some years been working with farmers to try to find ways of regenerating the lost land. And by combining tree and crop species, and using existing water harvesting methods, they appear to have developed a sustainable system that can restore productivity to these abandoned fields. Tunde Fatunde recently spoke to one of the researchers, Oscar Eyog Matig, to find out how a simple intercropping of crops and trees could bring lost land back into production. But Oscar began by explaining that their initial efforts had not been successful. IN:		?The first step was that scientists tried to use very heavy machinery. ? OUT:		?. Are needed? Yes. ? DUR?N		 6 ? 57 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Oscar Eyog Matig on a research project that has been helping farmers to restore degraded farmland in north Cameroon. Transcript Matig		The first step was that scientists tried to use very heavy machines to plough the land, to allow the land to increase its water holding capacity. And after two years we discovered that the soil will come back at the initial level of degradation. Fatunde	So two years of wasted effort? Matig	Because you have a very good yield of cotton or rice the first year but later on, two or three years after the yield becomes as it was at the beginning. Fatunde	Then what was the next solution to that? Matig	The next solution was how to sustain this. To sustain it we need to continue to harvest water and secondly to provide people and the land with crops which will continue to provide products to the farmers. Fatunde	Yes and what are these? Matig	And the practice that we used was farmer practice. The way they are harvesting water in that type of land and they are digging small dams, with all of those practices which can harvest the maximum of the rainfall. The species that we planted was tree species that have available water all the time and {{because of a lack of}} amount of water we decided also to make inter-cropping. Fatunde	Inter-cropping between what kind of trees and what kind of crops? Matig		As the water was in a very huge quantity we decided to use rice. Fatunde	Rice. Matig	And for the trees, we used two types of trees. The first one is what we call Acacia senegal, which is producing Gum Arabic. Fatunde	So Acacia senegal means Gum Arabic trees? Matig	Yes and the second was a fruit tree, local fruit trees which is called a marula but the scientific name is Sclerocarya birrea Fatunde	Two trees? Matig		Two trees. Fatunde	Now how did you marriage, through inter-cropping, these two trees and rice? Matig	You have the rice in the middle because the trees are planted 4 metres by 4 metres and in between you have the rice. Fatunde	What purpose do the trees serve? Matig	With this system we have three advantages. The first is that we have almost lost 20 % of the farmland in the region which we have now recovered. The second benefit is that we have planted a crop. Even if you are planting it only the two first years they can use it as additional, add value. Now for the third benefit, is the trees. You have Gum Arabic which is well known in the world, used to produce this chewing gum, used to produce coca cola. And you have also Sclerocarya birrea which is a fruit, a local fruit tree. Those ones will continue providing a product for the farmers. Fatunde	While at the same time rice production is going on seasonally? Matig		Yes. Fatunde	After two years or three years of this experimentation what was the reaction of the farmers who were working on a pilot project? Matig	The farmers were very surprised because for them this land was lost completely and they have noticed that we have regenerated the land. So for them it?s a very? even if it was the only success of the project it was enough. Fatunde	But that was not the only success of the project? Matig	But it was not the only success, they were producing crop as inter-cropping and it was another success for them because they were involved, it was they who were planting those crops and harvesting it. Fatunde	Did they also go ahead to multiply, reproduce this experiment on their own farms? Matig	Yes. Let me tell you one thing which is a major concern for the farmer to implement the same system by his own. There is a problem of land tenure. Whenever you have to plant a tree you should be the owner of the land. It is only those who are owners and mainly the chief who are able to implement the same system. Fatunde	Were they also able to have enough money to also build wells and so on? Matig	Yes because as I told you the system we use was learned from the farmers. Even the well or the small dams they are doing it themselves for other purpose. They are doing it for what we call a very specific variety of sorghum, we call muskwari. We are doing it already. Fatunde	Oh, they were doing it. What you people did was to do inter-cropping now? Matig	Now it?s only awareness, to tell them that what you are doing with the sorghum you can sustain it by putting very very important species and permanent species which can provide them incomes. When an Acacia senegal is well managed you have the Gum Arabic forever. Fatunde	I see. Now going back to the farmers, since you?ve visited some of them, how did you evaluate the progress you saw from what they learnt from your pilot project? Matig	The progress in the farmer when you have a new technology is very slow because the farmer was very happy to implement it as soon as possible. As I have told you they have the land constraints but this can be solved because it?s a problem of meeting local authorities and also it?s at policy level. So this can be solved. Technically what we found was that few farmers have started planting their own trees within the farmland. So when they started planting trees within the sorghum land it was an improvement. What we noticed was a very big demand of tree seedlings by farmers. Fatunde	So <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> future of this inter-cropping system you have introduced among the farmers in northern Cameroon? What is your own evaluation based on what you saw in the ground? Matig	What I saw on the ground is that this technology can quickly take off but they need some assistance, a policy support by the government and technical support by the scientists in the region. Fatunde	Are needed? Matig	Yes. End of track. Researcher Oscar Eyog Matig explains how intercropping of trees and cereal crops, combined with water harvesting, has restored degraded land in north Cameroon...|$|E
40|$|Diversifying crops {{for food}} and trade Suggested introduction: Across the Caribbean {{it is clear that}} {{agriculture}} needs to diversify. The loss of preferences in EU markets, for example, threatens the economic viability of traditional export crops such as sugar and bananas, and if farmers are to survive they will need to change what they grow, and how they grow it. So what are the options? One basic question is whether countries that traditionally import most of their food should be looking to increase the amount and variety of food crops grown on their own soil. Or should they simply grow other cash crops with strong export potential and sell these to fund continuing food imports? It?s a question that came under discussion at a recent conference focussing on food and nutrition security held in Belize. Susanna Thorp spoke to several participants about their vision of the future of agricultural diversity and trade, and how these link to the nutrition and food security of Caribbean people. In this report she begins by asking extension agent and agronomist, Richard Allport, about the situation regarding food, nutrition and trade, in his home country of Dominica. IN:		?Generally Dominica has always been considered [...] ? OUT:		? themselves as well as trade internationally. ? DUR?N		 8 ? 58 ? Back announcement: Sandra Plummer of the FAO ending that report on the links between crop diversification, income generation and supply of food in the Caribbean. Transcript Allport	Generally Dominica has always been considered as a food secure nation in terms of its food balance. Generally we have exported more food than we have imported in terms of value. However {{over the last few years}} we have seen some deterioration in the food and nutrition situation because we have seen some declines in the economy. Thorp	So why in particular has there been an impact on the economy, why has that been declining in the last couple of years? Allport	I think the major reason has been the decline of the banana industry and the whole question of the WTO negotiations and the impact on our economy. We now have a very open economy and many times we have been flooded with cheaper imports. That has caused a decline in incomes to farmers and as a result it has caused us to have less disposable income. Thorp	So what are you trying to do as an extension department to try and support farmers in this serious situation? Allport	The most effect that we can have is to try to raise productivity among farmers so that they can increase incomes. But we also would like our production to be consumed locally and many times we bring up issues of protection. Under our WTO obligations we cannot protect but there still is a reason why we need to protect our farmers. Furthermore I think that if our farmers are not protected it means that our country?s ability to even purchase from outside in the long run is affected. So if the economy is totally destroyed our ability to import is also destroyed or compromised. Thorp	And what about trying to diversify? If farmers have relied heavily on growing bananas in the past but this is not going to be a viable option in the future, what other options for growing other crops, perhaps more nutritional crops are there? Allport	Well the options are always there in terms of diversifying to feed our population. That is why I consider us still food secure. But then our ability to export agricultural produce is always compromised. So I think that is where the resources have to be put. Do we really have a comparative advantage in terms of exporting to other countries out there? So I think those are the real issues, it is not just the ability to feed ourselves but can we diversify into other crops that we can export like we did bananas for so many years. Thorp	And what about the issues of raising productivity, I mean how feasible is it to raise productivity beyond what you are doing already? Allport	I think it is feasible. We really have to embrace science and technology. But sometimes - even under our WTO obligations - raising productivity requires infrastructure and sometimes people see the required infrastructure as subsidies and they ask us not to subsidise. When the developed world?s agriculture is highly subsidised both in the EU and in the US. So those are other concerns of ours. Thorp	What about with policymakers, do you feel that they are doing enough to resolve the situation? Allport	I think our policymakers see it, but I think many times our hands are tied in terms of the kind of resources that we can generate to make those changes. I mean we are a poor underdeveloped country striving to compete in the developed world. NARR	In St Kitts and Nevis the government is already in the process of planning which crops it should prioritise, as it reduces its dependence on sugar exports. Jeffrey Berry, an extension officer with the Department of Agriculture, is concerned that this process is ignoring the capacity that the country?s own farmers have, to contribute to the national food supplies. Berry	Yes we have to feed a nation, but are the people, the population, the farmers benefiting from feeding ourselves? Thorp		Presumably they are not? Berry	They are not because what is really happening is that when we set out to look what crops should we produce we are looking from a marketing point of view as to what crops can we produce competitively, not necessarily to feed our nation. So I think somewhere along the line we have to draw the line and to break a kind of equilibrium as to production first of all in feeding yourself, feeding up to at least certain basic commodities. Thorp	Is there a possibility of being able to diversify so that farmers can grow some competitive crops but they can also be encouraged to grow nutritionally valuable crops too? Berry	That is the approach we are trying to do because St Kitts is moving out of sugar right now. I think this year is the last year that we are producing sugar for export. So we are looking at a diversification programme. And I think this is the downfall of the whole thing: we are going about it kind of one sided in the sense that we are just looking at it from a marketing point of view as to what kinds of crops we can produce competitively. I think we have to look at producing other crops that are nutritionally beneficial for the nation, on a smaller scale, but I think that is an integral part that we have to look at apart from the crops that we are producing to be competitive. NARR	While Jeffrey Berry stresses the importance of farmers growing at least some of their crops for domestic consumption, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation is currently running a pilot project to support farmers in production of some alternative cash crops. Sandra Plummer, a food security specialist with the project, which is operating in the 15 member states of CARICOM plus the Dominican Republic, explained how it is working. Plummer	You know that we have a lot of problems in terms of especially sugar and banana because of the erosion of the preferences with the European Union. I think countries are now in transition, in terms of where they should go where they would not be so dependent upon those preferences. Thorp	So what is the FAO pilot project doing to support farmers in this transition phase? Plummer	The project actually is attempting to improve the productivity of these selected crops and it is basically cash crops with the potential for trade in what we call the non-traditional commodities which find markets in places like Canada, the United States. Especially in those areas where you have the West Indian diaspora who are accustomed to eating a particular type of food and they are willing to buy it. So there is a kind of niche market there. Thorp	So what sort of interventions or technologies are you putting into place in order to support the growing of those crops? Plummer	The technology that is being used is drip irrigation because in many countries they have a problem of water and the management of the water. Thorp	So with having irrigation does this allow farmers to grow crops outside the traditional seasons? Plummer	That is exactly the whole point because what happens is that I can give you an example of one village in a country where everybody grew the same kind of crop. So you had a glut during the actual reaping season and then between seasons you had a deficit in terms of availability of food as well as availability of income. So the drip irrigation actually helps to stagger the production throughout the year so that the troughs and the heights of the cycle will actually be reduced. So you get little blips instead of huge hills and valleys. Thorp	So are there countries where there are particular lessons that would be valuable do you think that are already coming out of the project? Plummer	The country which has gone the furthest and has actually started to reap the first crop cycle is Belize. And I think Belize has the advantage and it is probably the reason why they were one of the first countries to actually start the production, in that they already have an intersectoral Animal Health and Food Safety Agency which co-ordinates all the requirements from the Ministries of Health and Agriculture and Trade. And hence it makes it easier for persons who are wishing to export crops. They do not need to go to eight different departments. They can go to one agency and get all the paperwork and documentation done. Thorp		So <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>the</b> way forward for the future? Plummer	I think in terms of regional development, as in Caribbean region, we hope to get a framework of food and nutrition security strategy for the region, which would then be able to advise programmes and plans of action of the different CARICOM and CARIFORUM member states. I think part of the process is the establishment of, for example, regional databases, regional marketing intelligence, so countries can all access it and be able to trade amongst themselves as well as trade internationally.

40|$|Repeated {{exposures}} to thin-idealized body shapes may alter women’s perceptions of what normal (e. g., accepted) and ideal (e. g., desired) bodies {{in a cultural}} environment look like. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether exposure to thin and round body shapes may change the subsequent esthetic appreciation of others’ bodies and the perceptual and cognitive–affective dimensions of self-body image in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN). Thirteen AN patients and 13 matched healthy controls were exposed to pictures of either thin or round unfamiliar body models and, before and after exposure, they were required to either express liking judgments about round and slim figures of unfamiliar bodies (esthetic task) or to adjust distorted pictures of their own body to their perceptual (<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> yourself?), affective (<b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> feel yourself?), metacognitive (<b>How</b> <b>do</b> others <b>see</b> <b>you?)</b> and ideal (How would you like to look like?) body image (self-body adjustment task). Brief {{exposures to}} round models increased liking judgments of round figures in both groups. However, only in AN patients, exposure to round models induced an increase in thin figures liking, which positively correlated with their preoccupation with dieting. Furthermore, exposure to round bodies in AN patients, but not in controls, increased the distortion for the perceptual body image and decreased the size of the ideal one. No differences between the two groups were obtained after adaptation to thin models. Our results suggest that AN patients’ perception of their own and others’ body is more easily malleable by exposure to round figures as compared to controls. Crucially, this mechanism may strongly contribute to the development and maintenance of self-body image disturbances. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
