5|$|When {{the crew}} awaken, they find {{themselves}} out of the control beds {{with no sign of}} the Gangers. However, their own personal belongings <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> through and the TARDIS has sunk into acid-corroded ground. The Doctor explains that they have likely been unconscious {{for more than an hour}} and the Gangers have gained sentience. They soon discover that two of the Gangers are amongst them, posing as Cleaves and Jennifer (Sarah Smart), when the two give themselves away by turning pale-white. Jennifer also exhibits the ability to contort and stretch her body well beyond human limits. The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge. The Gangers plan an attack, and the Doctor accuses Cleaves of killing a living being which Cleaves refuses to acknowledge. The Ganger Jennifer hunts her human counterpart to kill her. The Doctor determines that in a monastery, the safest place to be is the chapel, and directs everyone there. The Gangers, in acid-protection suits, bear down on the chapel. Rory responds to the sound of Jennifer screaming by deliberately separating from the group, against Amy's wishes. In the chapel, Amy and the Doctor discover a Ganger version of the Doctor.|$|E

2500|$|... 1999 - The Centre for Archaeology {{undertook}} {{an interim}} {{assessment of the}} milecastle. [...] The investigation reported that a very clear, distinct terrace {{could be seen in}} the ground. [...] Two trenches were dug in the area. [...] The first was a 6m by 2m trench outside the milecastle which showed a linear gully and a shallow pit which were dated to the Roman period by a pottery sherd. [...] The second trench was 8m long and 2m wide and crossed the west wall of the milecastle, it showed the structure to be buried beneath a deep layer of hillwash. [...] Post-Roman walls were found to have been built within the milecastle, which were presumed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>gone</b> by the 19th century as they are not mentioned by earlier reports. [...] Finds included pottery, charcoal, coal, slag, tiles, cattle bones and fired clay. [...] An unfinished 3rd century jet ring was discovered that was probably made in Whitby.|$|E
