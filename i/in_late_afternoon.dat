5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} the sun is {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. <b>In</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because the sun is at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|In May 1800 Napoleon, by {{then the}} undisputed leader of France, brought his troops across the Alps to Italy once again. On 14June his army met the Austrian forces at the Battle of Marengo (near Alessandria). Austrian troops were {{initially}} successful; by mid-morning they were {{in control of the}} field of battle. Their commander, Michael von Melas, sent this news south towards Rome. However, fresh French troops arrived <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> and Napoleon attacked the tired Austrians. As Melas retreated in disarray with the remains of his army, he sent a second courier south with the revised message. The Neapolitans abandoned Rome, and the city spent the next fourteen years under French domination.|$|E
5|$|In {{areas where}} the heavy {{rainfall}} {{is associated with a}} wind shift, the wet season is known as the monsoon. Rainfall in the wet season is mainly due to daytime heating which leads to diurnal thunderstorm activity within a pre-existing moist airmass, so the rain mainly falls <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> and early evening in savannah and monsoon regions. Further, much of the total rainfall each day occurs in the first minutes of the downpour, before the storms mature into their stratiform stage. Most places have only one wet season, but areas of the tropics can have two wet seasons, because the monsoon trough, or Intertropical Convergence Zone, can pass over locations in the tropics twice per year. However, since rain forests have rainfall spread evenly through the year, {{they do not have a}} wet season.|$|E

5|$|The rally began <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon.</b> Vizzini {{had agreed}} to permit the meeting as long as land problems, the large estates, or the Mafia were not addressed. Both {{speakers}} who preceded Li Causi, among which was Pantaleone, followed Vizzini’s commands. Li Causi did not. He denounced the unjust exploitation by the Mafia, and when Li Causi started {{to talk about how}} the peasants were being deceived by ‘a powerful leaseholder’ – a thinly disguised reference to Vizzini – the Mafia boss hurled: It’s a lie. Pandemonium broke out. The rally ended in a shoot-out which left 14 people wounded including Li Causi and Pantaleone. Six months later Vizzini acquired the lease for the Miccichè estate.|$|E

The Shakatavuyha Kaurav army tightly protected Jayadratha, however, preventing Arjuna from attacking him. Finally, <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> Arjuna found Jayadratha guarded by the mighty Kaurav army. Seeing his friend's plight, Lord Krishna raised his Sudarshan Chakra to cover the sun, faking a sunset. Arjun fought a powerful battle with Jayadrath and finally defeated him. Then, Arjuna shot a powerful arrow decapitating Jayadrath.|$|E
25|$|In late March, Major General Burnside’s army {{advanced}} on Fort Macon, a casemated masonry fort that {{commanded the}} channel to Beaufort, 35 miles (56km) southeast of New Bern. The Union force invested the fort with siege works and on April 25 opened an accurate {{fire on the}} fort, soon breaching the masonry walls. Within a few hours the fort's scarp began to collapse, and <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> the Confederate commander, Colonel Moses J. White, ordered the raising of a white flag. Burnside's terms of surrender were accepted, and the Federal troops took possession of the fort the next morning.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Kelly's Ford, {{also known}} as the Battle of Kellysville or Kelleysville, took place on March 17, 1863, in Culpeper County, Virginia, as part of the cavalry {{operations}} along the Rappahannock River during the American Civil War. It set the stage for Brandy Station and other cavalry actions of the Gettysburg Campaign that summer. Twenty-one hundred troopers of Brig. Gen. William W. Averell's Union cavalry division crossed the Rappahannock to attack the Confederate cavalry that had been harassing them that winter. Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee counterattacked with a brigade of about 800 men. After achieving a localized success, Union forces withdrew under pressure <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> without destroying Lee's cavalry.|$|E
25|$|A 60-minute special titled The Winner's Story is {{broadcast}} {{each year}} over the festive period, featuring the winner of that year's X Factor. Cameras follow the winner from {{the announcement of the}} result through the lead-up to the Christmas number one. As from 2010, one week before each series due to start, there features a special called X Factor Rewind looking back at the previous year's contestants and what happened to them during The X Factor and what has happened to them since the show ended. In Series 12, these programmes aired <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> slots on weekends. They started two weeks before the show began, and finished the day the show started, {{for the first time on}} ITV. In 2016, the same format was used, but with only 2 episodes, and airing on ITV2.|$|E
25|$|Jackson's {{inaction}} allowed some {{units to}} be detached from Franklin's corps <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> {{to reinforce the}} Union troops at Glendale. Jackson did not inform Lee of his situation and Lee did not send anyone to find Jackson {{until it was too}} late to make a difference. Although Jackson's wing of the Army and Franklin's corps comprised tens of thousands of men, the action at White Oak Swamp included no infantry activity and was limited to primarily an artillery duel. The Confederates lost 3 artillerymen killed and 12 wounded, but there is no exact record of the number of Union casualties; historian Brian K. Burton estimates as many as 100 Union casualties, with the highest losses in the 5th New Hampshire, which had 5 men killed and 9 wounded.|$|E

25|$|On 22 January 1944, San Francisco sortied with TF 52 {{and again}} {{headed for the}} Marshalls. On 29 January, the division, {{screened}} by destroyers, left the formation and moved against Japanese installations on Maloelap to neutralize them during the conquest of Kwajalein. Following the bombardment, the ships proceeded on to Kwajalein. San Francisco arrived off the atoll at about 0630 on 31 January. At 0730, she opened fire on targets of opportunity, initially a small ship inside Kwajalein lagoon. At 0849, she ceased firing. At 0900, she resumed firing at targets on Berlin and Beverly islands. Through the day, she continued to shell those islands, and, <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon,</b> added Bennett Island to her targets. During the next week, she provided pre-landing barrages and support fire for operations against Burton, Berlin, and Beverly islands. On 8 February, the cruiser sailed for Majuro, whence she would operate as a unit of TF 58, the fast carrier task force.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> the two {{lined up}} as {{bystanders}} watched the confrontation. They stood {{with their backs}} to each other at twenty paces. At {{the sound of a}} signal (the gunshot from a pistol) the two quickly turned to each other and fired their weapons. Their initial shots missed but soon after Anderson hit McCluskie in the mouth and neck while the latter hit Anderson in the arm. More shots were fired and McCluskie managed to hit Anderson in the stomach. However, the first one to fall was McCluskie, after Anderson emptied his pistol into him. Unfortunately for Anderson, McCluskie wounds were not fatal, and the two resumed their duel with knives. The second round saw Anderson and McCluskie repeatedly stabbing each other, and ultimately McCluskie fell for a second time, which ended the duel. He was rushed to a boarding house but died a day later. It was said that Anderson lived a short time longer before dying from his wounds as well. The duel was recorded {{in an article in the}} New York World on July 22, 1873.|$|E
25|$|The Confederate {{plan was}} once again marred by poor execution. Huger's men were slowed by felled trees obstructing the Charles City Road, {{spending}} hours chopping a new road through the thick woods. Huger failed to take any alternative route, and, fearing a counterattack, failed {{to participate in the}} battle. Magruder marched around aimlessly, unable to decide whether he should be aiding Longstreet or Holmes; by 4 p.m., Lee ordered Magruder to join Holmes on the River Road and attack Malvern Hill. Stonewall Jackson moved slowly and spent the entire day north of the creek, making only feeble efforts to cross and attack Franklin's VI Corps in the Battle of White Oak Swamp, attempting to rebuild a destroyed bridge (although adequate fords were nearby), and engaging in a pointless artillery duel. Jackson's inaction allowed some units to be detached from Franklin's corps <b>in</b> <b>late</b> <b>afternoon</b> to reinforce the Union troops at Glendale. Holmes's relatively inexperienced troops made no progress against Porter at Turkey Bridge on Malvern Hill, even with the reinforcements from Magruder, and were repulsed by effective artillery fire and by Federal gunboats on the James.|$|E
