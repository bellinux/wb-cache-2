25|$|ST Ericsson was a {{multinational}} manufacturer of wireless products and semiconductors, supplying to mobile device manufacturers. ST-Ericsson was a 50/50 joint venture of Ericsson and STMicroelectronics established on February 3, 2009, and dissolved on August 2, 2013. Headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland, {{it was a}} <b>fabless</b> company, outsourcing semiconductor manufacturing to foundry companies.|$|E
25|$|Most of {{the leading}} <b>fabless</b> {{semiconductor}} companies such as Apple Inc., Qualcomm, Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), MediaTek, Marvell, STMicroelectronics and Broadcom are customers of TSMC, as well as emerging players such as Spreadtrum, AppliedMicro, Allwinner Technology and HiSilicon, and many smaller companies. Leading programmable logic device companies Xilinx and Altera also make use of TSMC's foundry services.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{so-called}} <b>fabless</b> semiconductor companies, STMicroelectronics {{owns and}} operates its own semiconductor wafer fabs. The company owned five 8inch (200mm) wafer fabs and one 12inch (300mm) wafer fab in 2006. Most of the production is scaled at 0.18µm, 0.13µm, 90nm and 65nm (measurements of transistor gate length). STMicroelectronics also owns back-end plants, where silicon dies are assembled and bonded into plastic or ceramic packages.|$|E
25|$|PMC-Sierra {{provides}} broadband {{communications and}} storage semiconductors for metro, access, fiber to the home, wireless infrastructure, enterprise and channel storage, laser printers and customer premises equipment. PMC {{has more than}} 250 different semiconductor devices that are sold to equipment manufacturers, who in turn supply their equipment to communications network service providers and enterprises. As a <b>fabless</b> semiconductor company, PMC-Sierra designs and tests products, but outsources wafer fabrication and assembly functions to third party suppliers.|$|E
25|$|Intrinsity was {{a privately}} held Austin, Texas based <b>fabless</b> {{semiconductor}} company; {{it was founded}} in 1997 as EVSX on the remnants of Exponential Technology and changed its name to Intrinsity in 2000. It had around 100 employees and supplied tools and services for highly efficient semiconductor logic design, enabling high performance microprocessors with fewer transistors and low power consumption. The acquisition of the firm by Apple Inc. was confirmed on April 27, 2010.|$|E
25|$|Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) is an American {{multinational}} semiconductor {{company based}} in Sunnyvale, California, United States, that develops computer processors and related technologies for business and consumer markets. While initially it manufactured its own processors, the company later outsourced its manufacturing, a practice known as <b>fabless,</b> after GlobalFoundries was spun off in 2009. AMD's main products include microprocessors, motherboard chipsets, embedded processors and graphics processors for servers, workstations and personal computers, and embedded systems applications.|$|E
25|$|With the {{spin-off}} of its foundries, AMD {{became a}} <b>fabless</b> semiconductor manufacturer, designing products {{to be produced}} at for-hire foundries. Part of the GlobalFoundries spin-off included an agreement with AMD to produce some number of products at GlobalFoundries. Both prior to the spin-off and after AMD has pursued production with other foundries including TSMC and Samsung. It {{has been argued that}} this would reduce risk for AMD by decreasing dependence on any one foundry which has caused issues in the past.|$|E
25|$|For most of 2014, TSMC saw a {{continuing}} increase in revenues {{due to increased}} demand, primarily due to chips for smartphone applications. TSMC raised its financial guidance in March 2014 and posted ‘unseasonably strong’ first-quarter results. For Q2 2014, revenues came in at NT$183 billion, with 28 nanometer technology business growing more than 30% from the previous quarter. Lead times for chip orders at TSMC increased due to a tight capacity situation, putting <b>fabless</b> chip companies at risk of not meeting their sales expectations or shipment schedules, and in August 2014 {{it was reported that}} TSMC's production capacity for the fourth quarter of 2014 was already almost fully booked, a scenario that had not occurred for many years, which was described as being due to a ripple-effect due to TSMC landing CPU orders from Apple.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fabless</b> licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer {{has the ability to}} perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist (high clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While ARM Holdings does not grant the licensee the right to resell the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. Merchant foundries can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to re-manufacture ARM cores for other customers.|$|E

2500|$|The {{semiconductor}} industry, including IC manufacturing, design, and packing, forms a {{major part}} of Taiwan's IT industry. Due to its strong capabilities in OEM wafer manufacturing and a complete industry supply chain, Taiwan has been able to distinguish itself from its competitors. The sector output reached US$39 billion in 2009, ranking first in global market share in IC manufacturing, packaging, and testing, and second in IC design. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) are the two largest [...] contract chipmakers in the world, while MediaTek is the fourth-largest <b>fabless</b> supplier globally. In 1987, TSMC pioneered the <b>fabless</b> foundry model, reshaping the global semiconductor industry. From ITRI's first 3-inch wafer fabrication plant built in 1977 and the founding of UMC in 1980, the industry has developed into a world leader with 40 fabs in operation by 2002. In 2007, the semiconductor industry overtook that of the United States, second only to Japan. Although the global financial crisis from 2007 to 2010 affected sales and exports, the industry has rebounded with companies posting record profits for 2010. Taiwan has the largest share of 300nm, 90nm, and 60nm manufacturing capacities worldwide, and was expected to pass Japan in total IC fab capacity by mid-2011.|$|E

[...] At the same time, he was the technical leader for the XC4000 design automation software. [...] He led the architecture definition group for the Xilinx XC4000X device families. [...] He developed a Time-Multiplexed FPGA and software to map to it in the 1990s, long before Tabula commercialized the time-folded FPGA. [...] He is an inventor on approximately thirty patents in this area. [...] In the early 1990s, he edited and co-wrote Field-Programmable Gate Array Technology, introducing the first generation of academic researchers to the industrial side of programmable-logic architecture, tools and design.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Jodi Shelton, {{along with}} {{a half a dozen}} CEOs of <b>fabless</b> companies, {{established}} the <b>Fabless</b> Semiconductor Association (FSA) to promote the <b>fabless</b> business-model globally.|$|E
50|$|These {{conditions}} underlay {{the birth}} of the <b>fabless</b> business model. Companies were manufacturing integrated circuits (ICs) without owning a fabrication plant. Simultaneously, the foundry industry was established by Dr. Morris Chang with the founding of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation (TSMC). Foundries became the cornerstone of the <b>fabless</b> model, providing a non-competitive manufacturing partner for <b>fabless</b> companies.|$|E
5000|$|Spreadtrum Communications, Inc. (...) is a Chinese <b>fabless</b> {{semiconductor}} company {{headquartered in}} Shanghai which produces chipsets for mobile phones. It is the world's 17th-largest <b>fabless</b> semiconductor company measured by 2011 revenues.|$|E
50|$|The {{model has}} been further {{validated}} by the conversion of major IDMs to a completely <b>fabless</b> model, including (for example) Conexant Systems, Semtech, and most recently, LSI Logic. Today most major IDMs including Apple Inc., Freescale, Infineon and Cypress Semiconductor have adopted the practice of outsourcing chip manufacturing as a significant manufacturing strategy. As of 2007, the <b>fabless</b> model is the preferred business model for the semiconductor industry. The same year GSA tracked 10 separate <b>fabless</b> companies that had each surpassed $1 billion in annual revenues.|$|E

5000|$|The {{credit for}} {{pioneering}} the <b>fabless</b> concept {{is given to}} Bernie Vonderschmitt of Xilinx and Gordon A. Campbell of Chips and Technologies. The first <b>fabless</b> semiconductor company, the Western Design Center, was founded in 1978. Xilinx, founded in 1984, {{was the first to}} [...] "truly" [...] separate the design of chips from their manufacture.|$|E
50|$|In April 2001 IDT {{acquired}} Solidum Systems, an Ottawa-based <b>fabless</b> semiconductor company.|$|E
50|$|The terms <b>fabless</b> (fabrication-less), foundry, and IDM are {{now used}} to {{describe}} the role a company has in a business relationship. For example, Freescale owns and operates fabrication facilities (fab) where it manufactures many chip product lines, as a traditional IDM would. Yet it is known to contract with merchant foundries for other products, as would <b>fabless</b> companies.|$|E
50|$|When FSA was {{established}} in 1994, {{there were only three}} <b>fabless</b> companies—Cirrus Logic, Adaptec, and Xilinx—each with revenues in excess of $250 million. During the 1990s, industry pundits acknowledged the financial success of <b>fabless</b> companies, such as Nvidia, Broadcom, and Xilinx, and such companies as Cyrix produced competitively-priced products, benefiting consumers and driving the global market for computing devices.|$|E
