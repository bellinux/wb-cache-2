40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether and}} how socio-economic status is associated with children’s behavioural development in today’s children. Using a large cohort of English children born in the early 1990 s we find significant social inequalities in several dimensions of child behaviour at age 7. We examine whether these inequalities are associated with characteristics of the child’s early home environment and parental behaviours. These include the material quality of the child’s home, maternal mental health, parental conflict and child diet. Most of these factors are socially graded and so could potentially account for the gradient in behaviours, but none singly account for {{a large part of}} the gradient in behavioural outcomes. However, taken together, these differences in the home environment can explain up to <b>half</b> the social <b>gradients</b> in child behaviours...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDue {{to ongoing}} global changes, it is {{essential}} to establish a baseline record from which to determine future shifts in species distributions and community assembly patterns. In this context, we used digitised historical bryophyte distribution data along a 1021 m elevational gradient in Terceira Island (Azores) to determine how bryophyte species distribution varies with elevation and which spatial and climatic drivers contribute to this variation. We used ordinary least squares analysis to test for climatic and spatial data as explanatory variables for bryophyte richness and Mid-Domain Null simulations to assess the influence of spatial constraints on species distributions. Bryophyte richness follows a hump-shaped pattern, with mosses predominating in the first <b>half</b> of the <b>gradient</b> and liverworts in the second half. While moss richness did not correlate to any climatic variables and responded weakly to the presence of forest cover, liverwort presence was related to temperature, rainfall, humidity and the occurrence of native forest areas, suggesting that these plants are more sensitive to changes in their environment and can thus be used as better indicator species for climate change. Despite their inherent biases, our study shows that historically compiled data can be a valuable tool for preliminary assessment of macroecological patterns...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCytochrome c oxidase is a {{superfamily}} of membrane bound enzymes catalyzing the exergonic {{reduction of}} molecular oxygen to water, producing an electrochemical gradient across the membrane. The gradient is formed {{both by the}} electrogenic chemistry, taking electrons and protons from {{opposite sides of the}} membrane, and by proton pumping across the entire membrane. In the most efficient subfamily, the A-family of oxidases, one proton is pumped in each reduction step, which is surprising considering the fact that two of the reduction steps most likely are only weakly exergonic. Based on a combination of quantum chemical calculations and experimental information, it is here shown that from both a thermodynamic and a kinetic point of view, {{it should be possible to}} pump one proton per electron also with such an uneven distribution of the free energy release over the reduction steps, at least up to <b>half</b> the maximum <b>gradient.</b> A previously suggested pumping mechanism is developed further to suggest a reason for the use of two proton transfer channels in the A-family. Since the rate of proton transfer to the binuclear center through the D-channel is redox dependent, it might become too slow for the steps with low exergonicity. Therefore, a second channel, the K-channel, where the rate is redox-independent is needed. A redox-dependent leakage possibility is also suggested, which might be important for efficient energy conservation at a high gradient. A mechanism for the variation in proton pumping stoichiometry over the different subfamilies of cytochrome oxidase is also suggested.

40|$|We analyze {{optical and}} {{near-infrared}} data {{of a sample}} of 11 barred spiral galaxies, {{in order to establish}} a connection between star formation and bar/spiral dynamics. We find that 22 regions located in the bars, and 20 regions in the spiral arms beyond {{the end of the bar}} present azimuthal color/age gradients that may be attributed to star formation triggering. Assuming a circular motion dynamic model, we compare the observed age gradient candidates with stellar populations synthesis models. A link can then be established with the disk dynamics that allows us to obtain parameters like the pattern speed of the bar or spiral, as well as the positions of resonance radii. We subsequently compare the derived pattern speeds with those expected from theoretical and observational results in the literature (e. g., bars ending near corotation). We find a tendency to overestimate bar pattern speeds derived from color gradients in the bar at small radii, away from corotation; this trend can be attributed to non-circular motions of the young stars born in the bar region. In spiral regions, we find that ~ 50 % of the color gradient candidates are "inverse", i. e., with the direction of stellar aging contrary to that of rotation. The other <b>half</b> of the <b>gradients</b> found in spiral arms have stellar ages that increase in the same sense as rotation. Of the 9 objects with gradients in both bars and spirals, six (67 %) appear to have a bar and a spiral with similar Omega_p, while three (33 %) do not. Comment: Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effect of rib {{stiffeners}} on the free and forced vibration of a gradient coil in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. Several reinforcement schemes are studied in this paper. One scheme utilizes the existing holes in the gradient coil structure (typically reserved for magnetic shims) to produce the reinforcement. Non-ferrous, non-magnetic carbon fibre rib stiffeners are employed to fill these holes in several ways to strengthen a gradient coil. Another scheme replaces the inner <b>half</b> of the <b>gradient</b> coil material with a grid of interconnected axial and circumferential rib stiffeners. It is found that the structural stiffness of the gradient coil increases substantially when the coil is reinforced by carbon fibre rib stiffeners. The reinforcement affects the noise and vibration response of the gradient coil structure in the following ways. It increases the frequency range of forced response of the gradient coil at low frequencies due to the increased resonant frequency of the fundamental mode of the coil. Secondly, it reduces the forced response amplitude of the coil structure (which is governed by the structural stiffness of the coil). Thirdly, it reduces the number of natural modes in the low and medium frequency range and therefore lessens the chance of the coil structure being excited resonantly by magnetic resonance signal acquisition sequences. It is shown that gradient coils modelled by solid finite element models have higher stiffness along the coil’s circumference and lower stiffness in the axial direction than those using shell finite element models...|$|R
40|$|Receiver {{functions}} {{from three}} 30 -station IRIS-PASSCAL small-aperture arrays (2 – 15 km station spacing) operated for 10 months {{each in the}} northern Rocky Mountains show a ubiquitous negative polarity P to S conversion just preceding the 410 -km discontinuity arrival. Data from the three arrays were sorted into NW, SE, and SW back-azimuth quadrants and stacked to form nine quadrant stacks. Remarkably, the negative polarity arrival (NPA) is apparent in 8 of the 9 quadrant stacks, with 7 of the 8 having well-correlated waveforms. Each quadrant stack also contains clear P to S conversions from the 410 - and 660 -km discontinuities. Moveout analysis shows that all the major phases display the correct moveout for forward scattered P-S phases. The waveshapes for the seven similar NPA- 410 km discontinuity arrivals are modeled with a five-parameter “double gradient slab” model that is parameterized as follows: a top gradient thickness and shear velocity decrease; a constant velocity layer; bottom gradient thickness; and shear velocity increase. Model misfit is assessed via a grid search over the model space using a reflectivity code to calculate synthetic seismograms. Model likelihood is determined by calculating 1 - and 2 -D marginal probability density functions (PDF) for the five parameters. The 1 -D marginals display a range of peak values, although significant overlap is observed for the top gradient thickness and its associated velocity decrement. From the peak value of the summary PDF, we find the top velocity gradient to be sharp (s). Defining an effective thickness of the low-velocity layer as the mean layer thickness plus <b>half</b> the mean <b>gradient</b> thicknesses, the 410 low-velocity layer thickness {{is found to be}} 22 km. A review of changes in the physical state required to match our new 410 -LVL constraints suggests that the water-filter model remains an operative hypothesis to test...|$|R
40|$|Aims Invasion {{resistance}} in experimental plant communities {{is known to}} increase with increasing diversity and further {{to depend on the}} presence of particular functional groups. To test whether these effects also hold true for the invader establishment phase beyond the seedling stage, we studied survival and performance of Centaurea jacea L. (brown knapweecl) planted into experimental grassland communities of varying plant biodiversity over three consecutive years. Moreover, we analysed the role of insect herbivory and biomass of the recipient community for mediating diversity effects. Methods In 2005, seedlings of Centaurea were transplanted into experimental grassland communities (the Jena Experiment) covering a species richness (1 - 60) and functional group richness (1 - 4) <b>gradient.</b> <b>Half</b> of these transplants and the community surrounding them in each plot were sprayed with insecticide while the other half served as control. In 2006 and 2007 (during the second and third year after transplantation), we recorded survival, growth-related (e. g. transplant biomass, height) and reproduction-related traits (e. g. number of flower heads). Annual data on community aboveground biomass served as covariate to investigate mediating effects of aboveground competition with the recipient community. Important Findings Species richness was the most important factor responsible for Centaurea limitation. Higher levels of diversity decreased survival and all performance traits in both years. These diversity effects were partly driven by community biomass, but not fully explained by that covariate, suggesting the importance also of further processes. The influence of functional group richness was strong in the second year after transplantation and weaker in the third year. Among the particular functional groups, only the presence of legumes showed strong negative effects on Centaurea survival and weak negative effects on growth and reproduction, the latter two being mediated by biomass. Insect herbivore reduction considerably benefited Centaurea in sprayed monocultures, where it grew significantly larger than in all other diversity levels and than in the control subplots. We conclude that effects of plant community properties on invading individuals change in the course of establishment, that plant species richness effects are also important during later stages of establishment, and that biomass (especially at high diversity) and herbivory (especially at low diversity) of the recipient community are important in mediating community effects on invaders...|$|R
40|$|In {{power quality}} monitoring, {{determining}} {{the type of}} power quality disturbance occurring in the power system is important. Some disturbances such as, voltage dip, momentary interruption, voltage swell, or oscillatory transients in power systems may result internal-function or failure {{in the operation of}} some devices. Knowing the location where the disturbances occur in the system can yield an effective and efﬁcient result when an appropriate method is applied in the attempt to solve the power quality issues. Some traditional strategies such as, wavelet or Fast Fourier transforms have been applied to detect and locate power quality disturbances, suffer from the complexity of the algorithm and the calculation load. In this thesis, mathematical morphology has been investigated for this purpose due to the merits of robustness and the simple calculations needed. In this thesis, some novel strategies using mathematical morphology are presented to ﬁnd the time location of the disturbances, that is deﬁned as the start and end points when the disturbance occur in the time domain. The ﬁrst method was using morphology gradient, top-hat transform, and Skeletonization to identify the time location of the disturbances and noise in the system, and then plotting the results in 3 D for pattern recognition. This Skeletonization is also combined with Morphology Edge Detection to ﬁnd the accurate time location of disturbances in the system for both noise free signals and signals with noise. The overall result shows the reduction of the error was signiﬁcant compared to the result of morphology edge detection strategy. Another novel strategy is presented by converting a signal to an image then applying image processing techniques, which are then evaluated using a control chart to ﬁnd the time location of any disturbances. This conversion strategy is also applied for detecting the times of power quality disturbances uses short data samples of the signal (4 samples), {{so that it can be}} implemented as a real time detection strategy. The results show an accurate strategy in detecting disturbances. <b>Half</b> Multi-resolution Morphology <b>Gradients</b> (HMMG) based on multi-resolution morphology gradients (MMG) is also presented as a novel strategy and it operates in level 1 only, reducing the processing and increase the speed of detection of disturbance. The results show accurate detection when disturbances occur in the system. Other applications of MM are also presented such as a new alternative method in estimating the frequency in a signal based on top-hat and bottom-hat transforms with the results showing the ability of this method to handle low frequencies when the signal is a noise free signal. Neural networks are also implemented with MM for the identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of disturbances. All the novel strategies using Skeletonization, signal/image conversion and HMMG for disturbances detection were then evaluated using a real dataset and an experimental dataset. Overall results show that this three methods can detect disturbances accurately...|$|R
