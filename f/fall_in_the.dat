5|$|The Chilean {{government}} delayed their naval plans after {{a financial}} depression {{brought on by}} the 1906 Valparaíso earthquake and a drastic <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nitrate market in 1907, but these economic problems were not enough to stop them from countering the dreadnoughts purchased by their traditional rival Argentina.

5|$|Beer {{ranges from}} less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this {{strength}} can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> range of 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session beers being around 4% abv. Some beers, such as table beer are of such low alcohol content (1%–4%) that they are served instead of soft drinks in some schools.|$|E
5|$|Clevedon is {{situated}} on and round seven hills called Church Hill, Wain's Hill (which is topped by {{the remains of}} an Iron Age hill fort), Dial Hill, Strawberry Hill, Castle Hill, Hangstone hill and Court Hill which is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. On a clear day there are far reaching views across the Severn estuary to Wales. When the visibility is good the islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm in the Bristol Channel can be seen. The tidal rise and <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada.|$|E
5|$|Critics commented {{upon the}} character's {{resemblance}} both to horror film killers such as Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter, {{as well as}} to American Evangelists and to the biblical Jesus Christ. The series also follows Danes' rise and <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> public eye and the precariousness of fame. Though critics questioned the wisdom of having a pedophile as a character, the show's creative team was adamant that they had deliberately made him unlikable. In killing the character off, the creative team did not wish to suggest that the character had been redeemed for his earlier crimes, and made sure that this was emphasised even in his final act of self-sacrifice. Pullman has expressed interest in reprising the role in a future Torchwood series.|$|E

5|$|Dayton {{consistently}} has {{had one of}} {{the highest}} crime rates among US cities. Dayton has experienced an improving public safety environment since 2003, with crime declining in key categories according to FBI Uniform Crime Reports and Dayton Police Department data. In 2009, crime continued to <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city of Dayton. Crime in the categories of forcible rape, aggravated assault, property crime, motor vehicle theft, robbery, burglary, theft and arson all showed declines for 2009. Overall, crime in Dayton dropped 40% over the previous year. The Dayton Police Department reported a total of 39 murders in 2016, which marked a 39.3% increase in homicides from 2015.|$|E
5|$|Denny Island {{is a small}} rocky {{island of}} , with scrub vegetation, {{approximately}} three miles north of Portishead. Its rocky southern foreshore marks the boundary between England and Wales, but the island itself is reckoned administratively to Monmouthshire, Wales. The tidal rise and <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel can be as great as , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada. There has been concern about pollution levels from industrial areas in Wales and at {{the eastern end of}} the Bristol Channel; however, this tends to be diluted by the Atlantic waters. There are measurable levels of chemical pollutants, but little is known about their effects. Of particular concern are the levels of cadmium and to a lesser degree residual pesticides and hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{manufacturing}} developments The Churchill Machine Tool Co {{experienced a}} lean period from 1921 to 1934, {{being unable to}} distribute a dividend on its ordinary share capital. The commencement of European rearmament from 1935 is given {{as the cause of}} a dramatic turnaround in fortunes. A dividend of 12% was paid in that year; in the following year it was quadrupled and there was a special dividend of 125%. An adjustment to the share capital was made, and in 1938 the dividend was 40%, with an additional scrip bonus of 33.3%. There was a subsequent <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> yield to 30%, but in cash terms, allowing for capital restructuring, the payment remained the same.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, fuel {{stocks were}} used by the armies, and were {{unavailable}} to farmers. This allowed horses to remain a key aspect of agriculture and transportation {{until the end of}} the war. After the war, farmers rapidly mechanized their operations. The Auxois and other draft breeds were quickly abandoned in favor of machines, and population numbers began to <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 1950s and collapsed completely in the 1960s. By the 1970s, the Auxois had almost disappeared, although many villages in the breed's homeland retained a small number of mares for traditional competitions.|$|E
5|$|It is {{very rare}} for snow to <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. state of Florida, {{especially}} in the central and southern portions of the state. With {{the exception of the}} far northern areas {{of the state and the}} Jacksonville area, most of the major cities of Florida have never recorded measurable snowfall, have only recorded trace (T) amounts, or have only reported flurries in the air, usually just a few times each century. In the Florida Keys and Key West there is no known occurrence of snow flurries since the settlement of the region.|$|E
5|$|Negative {{pressure}} {{is believed to}} be a property of vacuum energy, but the exact nature and existence of dark energy remains one of the great mysteries of the Big Bang. Results from the WMAP team in 2008 are in accordance with a universe that consists of 73% dark energy, 23% dark matter, 4.6% regular matter and less than 1% neutrinos. According to theory, the energy density in matter decreases with the expansion of the universe, but the dark energy density remains constant (or nearly so) as the universe expands. Therefore, matter made up a larger fraction of the total energy of the universe in the past than it does today, but its fractional contribution will <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> far future as dark energy becomes even more dominant.|$|E

5|$|Some contemporaries {{alleged that}} Bonaparte was put {{under house arrest}} at Nice for his {{association}} with the Robespierres following their <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Thermidorian Reaction in July 1794, but Napoleon's secretary Bourrienne disputed the allegation in his memoirs. According to Bourrienne, jealousy was responsible, between the Army of the Alps and the Army of Italy (with whom Napoleon was seconded at the time). Bonaparte dispatched an impassioned defense {{in a letter to}} the commissar Saliceti, and he was subsequently acquitted of any wrongdoing.|$|E
5|$|The Mines Inspectorate {{began an}} enquiry, chaired by the mining {{engineer}} William Galloway. The report was published on 15 July. It {{stated that the}} mine was hot {{with high levels of}} coal dust present. The method used to load coal onto underground trucks created quantities of dust, which had aggravated a small explosion and created a chain reaction of related explosions throughout the workings. An inquest held in October concluded that various safety precautions had not been followed, and had the mine been sufficiently watered it would have reduced the coal dust held in the air. The colliery had further problems in October 1910 when a heavy roof <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mafeking return released trapped firedamp, which caused the mine to be temporarily evacuated.|$|E
5|$|The {{arterial}} partial {{pressures of}} oxygen {{and carbon dioxide}} in the arterial blood are homeostatically controlled. A rise in the arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and, to a lesser extent, a <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arterial partial pressure of oxygen, will reflexly cause deeper and faster breathing till the blood gas tensions return to normal. The converse happens when the carbon dioxide tension falls, or, again to a lesser extent, the oxygen tension rises: the rate and depth of breathing are reduced till blood gas normality is restored.|$|E
