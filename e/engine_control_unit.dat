5|$|Some drivers {{elected to}} make pit stops under caution. Fittipaldi had his <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and spark box changed on lap 17 after he {{reported}} {{a problem with}} his car. Bräck remained the leader at the lap-21 restart and {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field. Andretti began to reduce the gap between Bräck and himself between laps 31 and 33. Tagliani reduced his pace between the second and third turns on lap 42, and was ordered by his engineer to enter the pit lane. His crew removed his car's left sidepod and retired on the next lap with a battery problem. A second caution was necessitated on the 46th lap when debris was located in turn two. The leaders made their pit stops because of the mandatory pit stop window. Fittipaldi's car problem re-emerged on the 44th lap despite having his vehicle's coils and springs changed; he drove to the pit lane to retire because his team's mechanics could not rectify the issue. Franchitti stalled his car because of a clutch issue. Bräck maintained the first position at the lap-52 restart, followed by Takagi. Nine laps later, Takagi attempted to pass Bräck around the outside for the first position but was unable to complete the manoeuvre because of the presence of slower cars.|$|E
5|$|Webber passed Rast for sixth place, while Poulsen retired {{because of}} {{accident}} damage {{while attempting to}} return to the pit lane. Dumas held a 24-second advantage over Lotterer with di Grassi in third, while Evans moved back into the LMP2 lead. Both Toyota cars were battling for fourth position with Webber close behind. Webber overtook Davidson for fifth at the Radillion corner exit moving ahead of Sarrazin on the Kemmel straight one lap later. Di Grassi slowed with technical problems and limped into his garage for an <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> and front-left nose change. Toyota's No. 1 car was pushed into its garage with mechanical problems; it rejoined the circuit for a few laps until a throttle problem emerged, causing the car to run at a reduced pace. Lotterer retook the lead after the No. 18 Porsche driver switch took longer than expected. Rast passed Conway around the outside for fourth at the Bus Stop chicane. Vilander challenged Lietz for second in LMGTE Pro until Vilander was issued a track limit abuse penalty. Lotterer and Lieb battled each other for first place. Lotterer drove defensively after passing slower traffic going into Les Combes corner to keep the position. Lieb ran wide off the track at the Stavelot corner exit while lapping a slower car.|$|E

25|$|The Prius Plug-in {{has three}} drive modes, all-electric (EV), and two hybrid modes: Eco and Power. The EV mode is user-selectable and when running in this mode the hybrid <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU) {{operates}} the vehicle using only the larger motor-generator (MG2) if pre-determined parameters are satisfied, such as sufficient battery {{state of charge}} (SOC) and vehicle speed within EV mode range. The Eco mode is designed to maximize fuel savings for any driving conditions, and modifies or smoothes out the electronic throttle control program to reduce throttle response, reducing the throttle opening to a maximum of 11.6%, and also modifies the operation of the air conditioning system. As an additional benefit, the Eco mode improves performance in low-traction conditions because the reduced output helps to minimize wheel skidding such as those caused by ice and snow. Power mode increases throttle response in the middle range more than normal.|$|E
25|$|In {{petrol engine}} {{turbocharger}} applications, boost pressure {{is limited to}} keep the entire engine system, including the turbocharger, inside its thermal and mechanical design operating range. Over-boosting an engine frequently causes damage to the engine {{in a variety of}} ways including pre-ignition, overheating, and over-stressing the engine's internal hardware. For example, to avoid engine knocking (also known as detonation) and the related physical damage to the engine, the intake manifold pressure must not get too high, thus the pressure at the intake manifold of the engine must be controlled by some means. Opening the wastegate allows the excess energy destined for the turbine to bypass it and pass directly to the exhaust pipe, thus reducing boost pressure. The wastegate can be either controlled manually (frequently seen in aircraft) or by an actuator (in automotive applications, it is often controlled by the <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit).</b>|$|E
500|$|In August 1974, {{the first}} RB.199 powered flight of a {{prototype}} Tornado occurred; the engine completed its qualification tests in late 1978. The final production standard engine met both reliability and performance standards, though the development cost had been higher than predicted, {{in part due}} to the ambitious performance requirements. At the time of the Tornado's introduction to service, the turbine blades of the engine suffered from a shorter life span than desired, which was rectified by the implementation of design revisions upon early-production engines. Several uprated engines were developed and used on both the majority of Tornado ADVs and Germany's Tornado ECRs. The DECU (Digital <b>Engine</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Unit)</b> is the current <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> for RB 199 engines superseding the analogue MECU (Main <b>Engine</b> <b>Control</b> <b>Unit)</b> also known as CUE.|$|E

500|$|A key {{innovation}} in the Brazilian flex technology was avoiding {{the need for an}} additional dedicated sensor to monitor the ethanol-gasoline mix, which made the first American M85 flex fuel vehicles too expensive. This was accomplished through the lambda probe, used to measure the quality of combustion in conventional engines, is also required to tell the <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit</b> (ECU) which blend of gasoline and alcohol is being burned. This task is accomplished automatically through software developed by Brazilian engineers, called [...] "Software Fuel Sensor" [...] (SFS), fed with data from the standard sensors already built-in the vehicle. The technology was developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of Boschin 1994, but was further improved and commercially implemented in 2003 by the Italian subsidiary of Magneti Marelli, located in Hortolândia, São Paulo. A similar fuel injection technology was developed by the Brazilian subsidiary of Delphi Automotive Systems, and it is called [...] "Multifuel", based on research conducted at its facility in Piracicaba, São Paulo. This technology allows the controller to regulate the amount of fuel injected and spark time, as fuel flow needs to be decreased and also self-combustion needs to be avoided when gasoline is used because ethanol engines have compression ratio around 12:1, too high for gasoline.|$|E
2500|$|In 1981 Alfa Romeo {{developed}} {{in collaboration with}} the University of Genoa a semi-experimental Alfetta version, fitted with a modular variable displacement engine and an electronic <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit.</b> Called Alfetta CEM (Controllo Elettronico del Motore, or Electronic Engine Management), it was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The [...] 2.0-litre modular engine featured fuel injection and ignition systems governed by an <b>engine</b> <b>control</b> <b>unit,</b> which could shut off two of four cylinders as needed in order to reduce fuel consumption. An initial batch of ten examples were assigned to taxi drivers in Milan, to verify operation and performance in real-world situations. According to Alfa Romeo during these tests cylinder deactivation was found to reduce fuel consumption by 12% in comparison to a CEM fuel-injected engine without variable displacement, and almost by 25% in comparison to the regular production carburetted 2.0-litre. After the first trial, in 1983 a small series of 1000 examples was put on sale, offered to selected clients; 991 examples were produced. Despite this second experimental phase, the project had no further developments.|$|E

2500|$|The load {{regulator}} {{is essentially a}} large potentiometer that controls the main generator power output by varying its field excitation and hence the degree of loading applied to the engine.
