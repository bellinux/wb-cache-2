25|$|Subjective {{estimates}} of an individual's SA {{may also be}} made by experienced observers (e.g., peers, commanders, or trained <b>external</b> <b>experts).</b> These observer ratings may be somewhat superior to self-ratings of SA because {{more information about the}} true state of the environment is usually available to the observer than to the operator, who may be focused on performing the task (i.e., trained observers may have more complete knowledge of the situation). However, observers have only limited knowledge about the operator's concept of the situation and cannot have complete insight into the mental state of the individual being evaluated. Thus, observers are forced to rely more on operators' observable actions and verbalizations in order to infer their level of SA. In this case, such actions and verbalizations are best assessed using performance and behavioral measures of SA, as described next.|$|E
