In the first part the synthesis of two mycolic acid diastereomers (I and II) was achieved, thereby completing {{the full range of}} the cisdicyclopropane a-mycolic acid diastereomers. The second part comprised {{the development of a new}} method for the synthesis of the a-alkyl-B-hydroxy fragment of mycolic acids; two novel routes that involved fewer steps ted using L-malic as starting material. The first route which was via <b>diethyl</b> <b>malate</b> was achieved in fewer steps without a significant reduction in percentage yield. The second route via dimethyl malate was also completed successfiilly. Finally, a model cord facto III of a B-hydroxy carboxylic acid without an a-alkyl chain was prepared.

40|$|Thesis (MA (Sociology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. South Africa is {{a country}} of great diversity. Different climate zones {{and a host of}} {{different}} habitats make South Africa the perfect platform for rich floral diversity. This floral diversity lends itself to the study of natural products by discovering new natural drugs {{that can be used in}} the treatment of many illnesses. Studies into the antioxidant properties of plants that are used in traditional medicine are an important aspect of research to determine the rationale of the use of plants by traditional healers. Many neurodegenerative diseases, like epilepsy, Parkinson s and Alzheimer s diseases, are linked to oxidative stress. Antioxidants could play a major role as neuroprotective agents and could alter the progression of these diseases. Epilepsy is one of the world s most prevalent central nervous system disorders and affects more than seventy per one thousand children in South Africa. Most of these cases are people in rural areas of South Africa where communities rely on the use of traditional medicine. Cotyledon orbiculata L. var orbiculata (Haw.) DC. is widely used in traditional medicine to treat epilepsy and other central nervous system disorders. The need to screen these plants for activity and toxicity is very important to understand the complex mechanism of action in the treatment of patients. In this study the methanol extract and three different fractions of the methanol extract of Cotyledon orbiculata were used to test for antioxidant activity and toxicity towards neuroblastoma cells. The freeze dried leaves of Cotyledon orbiculata were extracted with methanol using a Soxhlet apparatus. The concentrated extracts were analysed using HPLC (high pressure liquid chromatography) and three major peaks were selected for isolation. Three assays were performed to assess the antioxidant activity and toxicity of the isolated compounds. The thiobarbituric acid assay (TBA) quantifies the extent of the inhibition of lipid peroxidation in rat brain homogenates by the isolated fractions. All of the samples were able to attenuate lipid peroxidation as seen from the results obtained from the TBA assay. The methanol extract showed the best attenuation of lipid peroxidation in the rat brain homogenate with fraction 1 and 2 showing greater attenuation of lipid peroxidation than fraction 3. The nitroblue tetrazolium assay (NBT) quantifies the ability of the fractions to scavenge superoxide radicals in a rat brain homogenate. All samples were able to scavenge superoxide radicals as indicated by the NBT assay. The methanol extract showed the best superoxide scavenging abilities in the assay whereas fraction 1 showed better scavenging abilities than fraction 2 and 3. The 3 –(4, 5 –dimethylthiazol– 2 –yl) – 2, 5 –diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay (MTT) indicates the toxicity of the fractions towards neuroblastoma cells. The methanol extract and fraction 2 in the highest concentration of 10 mg/ml were the only samples that showed toxicity towards neuroblastoma cells. The molecular structure of a compound from fraction 2 was determined by using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), infrared spectroscopy (IR), and mass spectroscopy (MS). This compound was identified as <b>diethyl</b> <b>malate.</b> <b>Diethyl</b> <b>malate</b> is an artefact that is generated in HPLC procedures in the presence of malic acid (which naturally occurs in the leaves of Cotyledon orbiculata) and ethanol. The methanol extract of Cotyledon orbiculata has high antioxidant activity and could be due to the presence of malic acid in the leaves of the plant. The rationale in the use of Cotyledon orbiculata in the treatment of epilepsy could not be determined due to the isolation of an artefact, <b>diethyl</b> <b>malate,</b> obtained from the fraction. Further research should include methods to prevent artefact formation and purification of the samples that are obtained. Master...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{feasibility}} of different extraction procedures was evaluated {{in order to test}} their potential for the extraction of the volatile (VOCs) and semi-volatile constituents (SVOCs) from wines. In this sense, and before they could be analysed by gas chromatography–quadrupole first stage masss spectrometry (GC–qMS), three different high-throughput miniaturized (ad) sorptive extraction techniques, based on solid phase extraction (SPE), microextraction by packed sorbents (MEPS) and solid phase microextraction (SPME), were studied for the first time together, for the extraction step. To achieve the most complete volatile and semi-volatile signature, distinct SPE (LiChrolut EN, Poropak Q, Styrene-Divinylbenzene and Amberlite XAD- 2) and MEPS (C 2, C 8, C 18, Silica and M 1 (mixed C 8 -SCX)) sorbent materials, and different SPME fibre coatings (PA, PDMS, PEG, DVB/CAR/PDMS, PDMS/DVB, and CAR/PDMS), were tested and compared. All the extraction techniques were followed by GC–qMS analysis, which allowed the identification of up to 103 VOCs and SVOCs, distributed by distinct chemical families: higher alcohols, esters, fatty acids, carbonyl compounds and furan compounds. Mass spectra, standard compounds and retention index were used for identification purposes. SPE technique, using LiChrolut EN as sorbent (SPELiChrolut EN), was the most efficient method allowing for the identification of 78 VOCs and SVOCs, 63 and 19 more than MEPS and SPME techniques, respectively. In MEPS technique the best results in terms of number of extractable/identified compounds and total peak areas of volatile and semi-volatile fraction, were obtained by using C 8 resin whereas DVB/CAR/PDMS was revealed the most efficient SPME coating to extract VOCs and SVOCs from Bual wine. <b>Diethyl</b> <b>malate</b> (18. 8 ± 3. 2 %) was the main component found in wine SPELiChrolut EN extracts followed by ethyl succinate (13. 5 ± 5. 3 %), 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol (13. 2 ± 1. 7 %), and 2 -phenylethanol (11. 2 ± 9. 9 %), while in SPMEDVB/CAR/PDMS technique 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol (43. 3 ± 0. 6 %) followed by diethyl succinate (18. 9 ± 1. 6 %), and 2 -furfural (10. 4 ± 0. 4 %), are the major compounds. The major VOCs and SVOCs isolated by MEPSC 8 were 3 -methyl- 1 -butanol (26. 8 ± 0. 6 %, from wine total volatile fraction), diethyl succinate (24. 9 ± 0. 8 %), and <b>diethyl</b> <b>malate</b> (16. 3 ± 0. 9 %). Regardless of the extraction technique, the highest extraction efficiency corresponds to esters and higher alcohols and the lowest to fatty acids. Despite some drawbacks associated with the SPE procedure {{such as the use of}} organic solvents, the time-consuming and tedious sampling procedure, it was observed that SPELiChrolut EN, revealed to be the most effective technique allowing the extraction of a higher number of compounds (78) rather than the other extraction techniques studied...|$|E
40|$|Imidacloprid is a {{neonicotinoid}} insecticide that {{is effective}} against house fly, Musca domestica L., {{which is a}} major pest {{with the ability to}} develop resistance to insecticides. In the present study, we investigated the inheritance mode, the cross-resistance pattern and the mechanisms of resistance to imidacloprid. A near-isogenic house fly line (N-IRS) with 78 -fold resistance to imidacloprid was used to demonstrate the mode of inheritance. The overlapping confidence limits of LC 50 values and the slopes of the log concentration-probit lines between the reciprocal F 1 and F 1 ' progenies suggest that imidacloprid resistance is inherited autosomally in the house fly. There was incomplete dominant inheritance in the F 1 and F 1 ' progenies, based on dominance values of 0. 77 and 0. 75, respectively. A monogenic inheritance model revealed that imidacloprid resistance is governed by more than one factor. Compared to the field strain (CFD), the N-IRS strain developed more cross-resistance to chlorfenapyr and no cross-resistance to chlorpyrifos and acetamiprid, but showed negative cross-resistance to beta-cypermethrin and azamethiphos. Three synergists, <b>diethyl</b> <b>malate</b> (DEM), s,s,s-tributylphosphorotrithioate (DEF), and piperonyl butoxide (PBO), showed significant synergism against to imidacloprid (4. 55 -, 4. 46 - and 3. 34 -fold respectively) in the N-IRS strain. However, both DEM and PBO had no synergism and DEF only exhibited slight synergism in the CSS strain. The activities of carboxylesterase (CarE), glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) and cytochrome P 450 in the N-IRS strain were significantly higher than in the CSS strain. But similar synergistic potential of DEF to imidacloprid between the CSS and N-IRS strain suggested that GSTs and cytochrome P 450 played much more important role than esterase for the N-IRS strain resistance to imidacloprid. These results should be helpful for developing an improved management strategy to delay the development of imidacloprid resistance in house fly...|$|E
