40|$|Semiconductor {{strain gauges}} {{were used to}} measure the {{internal}} strain along the axes of spherical and disk plaster specimens when subjected to lithotripter shock pulses. The pulses were produced by one of two lithotripters. The first source generates spherically diverging shock waves of peak pressure approximately 1 MPa at the surface of the specimen. For this source, the incident and first reflected pressure (P) waves in both sphere and disk specimens were identified. In addition, waves reflected by the disk circumference were found to contribute significantly to the strain fields along the disk axis. Experimental results compared favorably to a ray theory analysis of a spherically diverging shock wave striking either concretion. For the sphere, pressure contours for the incident P wave and caustic lines were determined theoretically for an incident spherical shock wave. These caustic lines indicate the location of the highest stresses within the sphere and therefore the areas where damage may occur. Results were also presented for a second source that uses an ellipsoidal reflector to generate a 30 -MPa focused shock wave, more closely approximating the wave fields of a clinical <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>lithotripter...</b>|$|E

40|$|The <b>extracorporeal</b> {{shock wave}} <b>lithotripter</b> (SD- 3) was used on 30 {{patients}} with upper urinary tract calculi from December, 1988 to March, 1989. At {{one month after}} the treatment, 11 patients (36. 7 %) were free from stones and 9 (30. 0 %) had stone fragments than 5 mm in diameter, making an effective rate of treatment of 66. 7 %. Gross hematuria, skin ecchymosis, pain and fever were observed as side effects, but none of them were serious. We concluded that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy using SD- 3 for upper urinary tract stones is an effective treatment without any serious side effects...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: To compare extracorporeal {{shock wave}} {{lithotripsy}} (ESWL) and laser induced shock wave lithotripsy (LISL) of retained bile duct stones to stone free rate, number of therapeutic sessions, and costs. PATIENTS: Thirty four patients {{were randomly assigned}} to either ESWL or LISL therapy. The main reasons for failure of standard endoscopy were due to stone impaction (n = 12), biliary stricture (n = 8), or large stone diameter (n = 14). METHODS: An <b>extracorporeal</b> piezoelectic <b>lithotripter</b> with ultrasonic guidance and a rhodamine 6 G laser with an integrated stone tissue detection system were used. LISL was performed exclusively under radiological control. RESULTS: Using the initial methods complete stone fragmentation was achieved in nine of 17 patients (52. 4 %) of the ESWL group and in 14 of 17 patients (82. 4 %) in the LISL group, or combined with additional fragmentation techniques 31 of the 34 patients (91. 2 %) were stone free at the end of treatment. In comparison LISL tended to be more efficient in clearing the bile ducts (p = 0. 07, NS). Significantly less fragmentation sessions (1. 29 v 2. 82; p = 0. 0001) and less additional endoscopic sessions (0. 65 v 1. 6; p = 0. 002) were necessary in the LISL group. There were no major complications in either procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with ESWL, fluoroscopically guided LISL achieves stone disintegration more rapidly and with significantly less treatment sessions, which leads to a significant reduction in cost...|$|R
40|$|Cavitation bubble {{nucleation}} following {{the passage of}} an <b>extracorporeal</b> shock wave <b>lithotripter</b> pulse is investigated experimentally and numerically. In the experiments two configurations are considered: Free passage of the shock wave, and reflection of the shock wave from a rigid reflector. The nucleation and the early growth phase of the bubbles including radial and translatory motion is compared with a commonly used model for bubble dynamics, the Gilmore model, which is coupled to a one-dimensional model for translatory motion. Reasonable agreement is found for the predicted translatory motion of the bubble center; however, considerable disagreement between a simple cavitation inception theory and the experiment exists: Cavitation bubbles expand later than predicted pointing to a more complex inception scenario than a single stabilized gas pocket. A hypothesis is proposed to explain the delayed growth of the bubbles. Additional findings are the formation of bands with diminished bubble activity, which very much resemble the structure found by Sokolov et al. (2001). High-speed photographs suggest that bubble¿bubble interaction {{plays an important role}} in the formation of structured bands...|$|R

We conducted preliminary clinical trials with the apparatus from April to June 1991. In this report we discuss our experience with the first 40 patients (52 stones) treated in a total of 52 extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) sessions. Follow up observation was conducted for three months. Except in one case, invasive anesthesia was not used. A double J-catheter was inserted in 13 cases, a ureteral catheter in 7 cases, and percutaneous nephrolithotripsy (PNL) was used after ESWL in one case. After one month of follow-up, 27 patients (67. 5 %) were completely free from stone fragments, while at 3 months after treatment, 34 patients (85. 0 %) were free from stone fragments. No serious complications were observed after ESWL. We concluded that the Dornier MFL- 5000 -(U) apparatus is effective for renal and ureteral stones and generates no serious complications...|$|R
40|$|An {{electrohydraulic}} lithotripter {{has been}} designed that mimics {{the behavior of the}} Dornier HM 3 <b>extracorporeal</b> shock wave <b>lithotripter.</b> The key mechanical and electrical properties of a clinical HM 3 were measured and a design implemented to replicate these parameters. Three research lithotripters have been constructed on this design and are being used in a multi-institutional, multidisciplinary research program to determine the physical mechanisms of stone fragmentation and tissue damage in shock wave lithotripsy. The acoustic fields of the three research lithotripters and of two clinical Dornier HM 3 lithotripters were measured with a PVDF membrane hydrophone. The peak positive pressure, peak negative pressure, pulse duration, and shock rise time of the focal waveforms were compared. Peak positive pressures varied from 25 MPa at a voltage setting of 12 kV to 40 MPa at 24 kV. The magnitude of the peak negative pressure varied from - 7 to - 12 MPa over the same voltage range. The spatial variations of the peak positive pressure and peak negative pressure were also compared. The focal region, as defined by the full width half maximum of the peak positive pressure, was 60 mm long in the axial direction and 10 mm wide in the lateral direction. The performance of the research lithotripters was found to be consistent at clinical firing rates (up to 3 Hz). The results indicated that pressure fields in the research lithotripters are equivalent to those generated by a clinical HM 3 lithotripter. © 2000 American Institute of Physics...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} emission from cavitation in {{the field}} of an <b>extracorporeal</b> shock wave <b>lithotripter</b> has been studied using a lead zirconate titanate piezoceramic (PC 4) hydrophone {{in the form of a}} 100 -mm diameter focused bowl of 120 -mm focal length. With this hydrophone directed at the beam focus of an electrohydraulic lithotripter radiating into water, it is possible to identify signals well above the noise level, at the 1 -MHz resonance of the hydrophone, which originate at the beam focus. Light emission, attributed to sonoluminescence, is also shown to originate at the focal region of the lithotripter, and the signal obtained from a fast photomultiplier tube directed at the focus has similarities in structure and timing to the detected acoustic signals. The multiple shock emission resulting from a single discharge of an electrohydraulic source is shown to result in two separate bursts of cavitational activity separated by a period of 3 - 4 ms. The signal burst corresponding to the primary shock has a duration of about 600 us with little noticeable structure. The signal burst associated with the secondary shock has a reproducible structure with two distinct peaks separated by about ~ 200 us depending on the shock amplitude. The timing and structure of each burst is shown to be in reasonable agreement with the theoretical predictions made by Church (1989) based on the Gilmore model of bubble dynamics. In particular, it is shown that it is possible to obtain precise measurements of the time delay between the separate peaks within the signal burst detected following the secondary shock and this may, as predicted, provide a method of determining the size of bubbles remaining after the primary shock...|$|R
