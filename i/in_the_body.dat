5|$|Psilocybin (O-phosphoryl-4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine, 4-PO-Psilocin, or 4-PO-HO-DMT) is a prodrug that is {{converted}} into the pharmacologically active compound psilocin <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> by a dephosphorylation reaction.

60|$|From whence I {{think it}} easy to draw this observation,--that the ideas of primary qualities of bodies are resemblances of them, and their {{patterns}} do really exist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> themselves, but <b>the</b> ideas produced <b>in</b> us by these secondary qualities have no resemblance of them at all. There is nothing like our ideas, existing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> themselves. They are, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> we denominate from them, only a power to produce those sensations in us: and what is sweet, blue, or warm in idea, is but the certain bulk, figure, and motion of <b>the</b> insensible parts, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bodies</b> themselves, which we call so.|$|R

5|$|Anatomy can {{be studied}} using both {{invasive}} and non-invasive methods {{with the goal of}} obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems. Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures. Angiography using X-rays or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies are protein {{components}} of an {{adaptive immune system}} whose main function is to bind antigens, or foreign substances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body,</b> and target them for destruction. Antibodies can be secreted into the extracellular environment or anchored in the membranes of specialized B cells known as plasma cells. Whereas enzymes are limited in their binding affinity for their substrates by the necessity of conducting their reaction, antibodies have no such constraints. An antibody's binding affinity to its target is extraordinarily high.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations that are as much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E

5|$|Because of titanium's {{superior}} {{strength and}} light weight {{relative to other}} metals (steel, stainless steel, and aluminium), and because of recent advances in metalworking techniques, its use has become more widespread {{in the manufacture of}} firearms. Primary uses include pistol frames and revolver cylinders. For the same reasons, it is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> of laptop computers (for example, in Apple's PowerBook line).|$|E
5|$|Because {{titanium}} is non-ferromagnetic, {{patients with}} titanium implants {{can be safely}} examined with magnetic resonance imaging (convenient for long-term implants). Preparing titanium for implantation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> involves subjecting it to a high-temperature plasma arc which removes the surface atoms, exposing fresh titanium that is instantly oxidized.|$|E
5|$|Cancer, {{particularly}} when metastatic (spread {{to other places}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body),</b> is a recognised risk factor for thrombosis. A number of mechanisms have been proposed, such as activation of the coagulation system by cancer cells or secretion of procoagulant substances. Furthermore, particular cancer treatments (such {{as the use of}} central venous catheters for chemotherapy) may increase the risk of thrombosis further.|$|E

5|$|Due {{to their}} similar atomic radii, {{rubidium}} and caesium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> mimic potassium and are taken up similarly. Rubidium has no known biological role, but may help stimulate metabolism, and, similarly to caesium, replace potassium <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>body</b> causing potassium deficiency. Partial substitution {{is quite possible}} and rather non-toxic: a 70kg person contains on average 0.36g of rubidium, {{and an increase in}} this value by 50 to 100 times did not show negative effects in test persons. Rats can survive up to 50% substitution of potassium by rubidium. Rubidium (and to a much lesser extent caesium) can function as temporary cures for hypokalemia; while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems, caesium is never able to do so. There is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in goats; even if this is true, the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough.|$|E
