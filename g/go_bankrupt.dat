5|$|Unbeknownst to Wall Street, a new {{crisis was}} being averted in the background. On Sunday, Morgan's associate, George Perkins, was {{informed}} that the City of New York required at least $20 million by November 1 or it would <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt.</b> The city tried to raise money through a standard bond issue, but failed to gather enough financing. On Monday and again on Tuesday, New York Mayor George McClellan approached Morgan for assistance. In an effort to avoid the disastrous signal that a New York City bankruptcy would send, Morgan contracted to purchase $30 million worth of city bonds.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E. Cheese's Pizza Time Theatres company, {{which was founded in}} 1977. Only one major project was made out of the new studio, an animated Christmas movie for NBC starring Chuck E. Cheese and other PTT mascots. The animation movement would be made using Tweening instead of traditional cel animation. After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined with the Computer Division of LucasFilm. Coincidentally, Steve Jobs, a main Apple shareholder and former CEO, worked under Bushnell in 1973 as a technician at his other company Atari, which Bushnell sold to Warner Communications in 1976 to focus on PTT. PTT would later <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt</b> in 1985 and be acquired by ShowBiz Pizza Place.|$|E

25|$|Heap leach is {{significantly}} cheaper than traditional milling processes. The low costs allow for lower grade ore to be economically feasible (given {{that it is}} the right type of ore body). Environmental law requires that the surrounding ground water is continually monitored for possible contamination. The mine will also have to have continued monitoring even after the shutdown of the mine. In the past mining companies would sometimes <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt,</b> leaving the responsibility of mine reclamation to the public. Recent additions to the mining law require that companies set aside the money for reclamation before the beginning of the project. The money will be held by the public to insure adherence to environmental standards if the company were to ever <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt.</b>|$|E

From the 1980s, the largest cities introduced toll rings to finance new road projects. A banking crisis hit Norway in the late 1980s, causing the largest banks, such as Den norske Bank, Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, to be nationalized.

25|$|Banks {{throughout}} Italy {{went through}} many {{changes in the}} late 1800s to early 1900s. One of the Milanese banks, the SBI, had many issues resolving its resources. It did not have support from foreign banks nor enough savings domestically. Other banks during this time in Italy, specifically during the 1907 international crisis, had high liquid assets and {{would have had to}} <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt</b> without the help from Banca d'Italia. A group of industrialists and bankers from Milan transformed the banking institute Figli di Weil Schott e C. into the Società Bancaria Milanese.|$|E

He was however able to avoid paying the taxes by transferring the assets of Steaua to a newly formed company, AFC Steaua Bucureşti, allowing the old association to <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt.</b> As of 2007, Becali detains no official link to the club, as he gradually renounced his shares in favour of his nephews.|$|E
25|$|From 1911 the {{government}} required {{the company to}} establish a fund which would aid the workers should the company <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt.</b> This was introduced after several large industrial companies had collapsed {{in the past decade}} and large costs had befallen the state. Just as the first expansion was competed, Sydvaranger decided that it needed to further expand its export capacity to 650,000 tonnes. Financing was secured through issuing new shares worth NOK3million. Investments included a new steam shovel, three steam cranes, three locomotives, a new briquetting plant; the work was completed in 1913. In 1913 the company had 1,150 employees.|$|E

25|$|West's {{next film}} was The Heat's On (1943) for Columbia Pictures. She {{initially}} {{did not want}} to do the film, but after actor/producer/director and personal friend Gregory Ratoff (producer Max Fabian in All About Eve) pleaded with her and claimed he would <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt</b> if she could not help, West relented as a personal favor. Censors by now, though, had curtailed the sexual burlesque of the West characterization. The studio had orders to raise the neck lines and clean up the double entendres. This was the only film for which West was virtually not allowed to write her own dialogue, and as a result the film suffered.|$|E
25|$|The French began {{building}} their line quickly, and finished construction in 1895, while the British worked slowly. At {{the time of}} the Beirut–Damascus line's inception, Pilling's company only managed to build a special port in Haifa to aid in the line's construction. Eight kilometers of standard gauge railroad were laid, between Haifa and Yagur, and a 20km dike was created for the next stage of construction. Due to the competition from the French railway in Beirut, the port of Haifa became less attractive to international traders and that, coupled with strife within the Syria Ottoman Railway Company, caused Pilling to <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt</b> and lose the permit for the railway.|$|E
25|$|The housing {{cooperative}} {{is a special}} legal entity, regulated in Swedish law. It has the same obligations of bookkeeping and issuing annual reports as companies and it can take mortgages in the property if needed. In addition, each member may also take mortgages in his bostadsrätt in order to finance his acquisition of it. The monthly fee paid by the members to the cooperative is intended to cover the operational and financial expenditures of the cooperative. The financial situation of the Swedish cooperatives vary a lot, and on rare occasions cooperatives may <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt.</b> If bankruptcy occurs, the property is sold and the remaining assets are shifted out to the members (who may stay on as tenants or try {{to form a new}} cooperative).|$|E

25|$|One {{week after}} the {{contracts}} were executed, Flood & Conklin declared bankruptcy. In 1965, shortly before {{the first of its}} annual payments was due, Prima paid its first installment into an escrow account and told Flood's attorneys that it considered the consulting agreement breached. F & C responded with a notice of intent to arbitrate. Near the end of its permitted response period, Prima instead petitioned the Southern District of New York to rescind the contracts and enjoin Flood & Conklin from arbitration. Since that company had represented itself as solvent during the negotiations only to <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt</b> shortly after signing the deal, Prima argued, the contracts had been fraudulently induced and thus the arbitration clauses by extension could not be enforced.|$|E
25|$|Although {{converts}} to Islam made up roughly 10% {{of the native}} population – {{most of the people}} living under Umayyad rule were not Muslim – this percent was significant due to the very small number of Arabs. Gradually, the non-Arab Muslims outnumbered the Arab Muslims, causing alarm among the Arab nobility. Socially, this posed a problem as the Umayyads viewed Islam as the property of the aristocratic Arab families. There was a rather large financial problem posed to the Umayyad system as well. If the new {{converts to}} Islam from non-Arab peoples stopped paying the jizya tax stipulated by the Qur'an for non-Muslims, the empire would <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt.</b> This lack of civil and political rights eventually led the non-Arab Muslims to support the Abbasids, despite the latter also being Arab.|$|E
25|$|Construction was {{authorized}} on July 24, 2011, before advanced planning had been completed. The project will cost NIS 1.95 billion {{and will be}} funded partly by real estate revenue from selling the Eilat Airport's land. The planning budget, approved on May6, 2010, is NIS 56million. There was a plan to make the airport a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, but the Israel Airports Authority (IAA) objected, and the government authorized it to plan and oversee the project. Despite this, {{it is estimated that}} if the IAA takes on the funding completely on its own, it will <b>go</b> <b>bankrupt</b> and default on its debts. Danya Cebus will build the passenger terminal. The terminal is set to feature a duty-free shop, a feature which was not present in Eilat Airport. Mer Group will provide command and control for the airport, including CCTV and perimeter protection.|$|E
