5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of the forearm. The medial <b>epicondyle</b> of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the forward thrust of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
25|$|Posteriorly {{below the}} knee joint, the popliteus {{stretches}} obliquely from the lateral femoral <b>epicondyle</b> down to the posterior surface of the tibia. The subpopliteal bursa is located deep to the muscle. Popliteus flexes the knee joint and medially rotates the leg.|$|E

2500|$|A [...] is {{the round}} {{prominence}} {{at the end}} of a bone, most often part of a joint – an articulation with another bone. The [...] refers to a projection near a condyle, particularly the medial <b>epicondyle</b> of the humerus. These terms derive from Greek.|$|E
5000|$|The {{ulnar nerve}} {{runs in a}} groove {{on the back of}} this <b>epicondyle.</b> The medial <b>epicondyle</b> protects the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve is {{vulnerable}} because it passes close to the surface along the back of the bone. Striking the medial <b>epicondyle</b> causes a tingling sensation in the ulnar nerve. This response is known as striking the “funny bone”. [...] The name funny bone could be from a play on the words humorous and humerus, the bone on which the medial <b>epicondyle</b> is located. The medial <b>epicondyle</b> is located on the distal end of the humerus. Additionally, the medial <b>epicondyle</b> is inferior to the medial supracondylar ridge. It is also proximal to the olecranon fossa.|$|E
5000|$|The medial <b>epicondyle</b> of the humerus is an <b>epicondyle</b> of the humerus bone of {{the upper}} arm in humans. It is larger and more {{prominent}} than the lateral <b>epicondyle</b> and is directed slightly more posteriorly in the anatomical position. In birds, where the arm is somewhat rotated compared to other tetrapods, {{it is called the}} ventral <b>epicondyle</b> of the humerus. In comparative anatomy, the more neutral term entepicondyle is used.|$|E
50|$|A supracondylar humerus {{fracture}} is {{a fracture}} of the distal humerus {{just above the}} <b>epicondyles.</b> While relatively rare in adults {{it is one of}} the more common fractures to occur in children and is often associated with the development of serious complications.|$|R
30|$|Two fresh-frozen {{right-handed}} {{upper limb}} cadaver specimens without evidence of previous trauma, surgery or deformity {{were prepared to}} mimic an arthroscopic setting. These specimens were derived from bodies that entered the department of anatomy through a donation program.

40|$|Many authors {{presented}} the epicondylar axis as the fixed {{axis of rotation}} of the femoral condyles during flexion of the knee. Positioning of the femoral component of a total knee arthroplasty (TKA) based on the <b>epicondyles</b> has been proposed. This work is a critical analysis of this concept. Metallic bodies were inserted {{at the level of}} collateral ligament insertions on 16 dried femurs, allowing us to locate the surgical epicondylar axis. The dried femurs were studied using standard radiographs and CT-scan. CT cuts were made perpendicular to the epicondylar axis. The medial mechanical femoral angle and the epicondylar angle were measured on the radiographs. The posterior and distal epiphyseal rotations relative to the epicondylar axis (Posterior Condylar Angle, PCA, and Distal Condylar Angle, DCA, respectively) were measured on the CT-scans. PCA and DCA values were compared. The centre of the posterior femoral condyles was located on sagittal reconstructions using the tangent method and was confirmed with circular templates, and then compared to the location of the <b>epicondyles.</b> Circle-fitting of the entire femoral condylar contours centred on the <b>epicondyles</b> was also tried. The mechanical femoral axis was nearly perpendicular to the epicondylar axis but with important variations. The average PCA and DCA were 1. 9 ± 1. 8 and 3. 1 ± 2. 1, respectively. No relationship could be established between the mechanical femoral angle and the PCA. The individual differences between the PCA and the DCA averaged 2. 2. A significant distance was found between the centre of the condylar contours and the epicondyles: 6. 5 mm in average on the lateral side (range 2. 3 – 11. 3 mm) and 8. 4 mm on the medial side (range 4. 0 – 11. 6 mm). Circle-fitting of the entire medial or lateral femoral condylar contours centred on the <b>epicondyles</b> was not possible. The centre of the posterior femoral condyles is significantly different from the epicondylar axis, thus refuting the conclusions of previous authors. Furthermore, considering the differences between the distal and posterior condylar angles shown here, as well as the difficulty of repeatably locating the <b>epicondyles</b> during surgery, using the epicondylar axis as the only landmark to position the femoral component during a first intention TKA is not recommended. The surgical epicondylar axis {{does not appear to be}} an adequate basis for the understanding of the shape of the distal femur...|$|R
30|$|More {{recently}} {{the phenomenon of}} the atypical femoral shaft fracture (or atypical femoral fracture, AFF) has become recognised. This describes the occurrence of femoral stress fractures affecting the femoral diaphysis (between the immediate subtrochanteric area to just proximal to the <b>epicondyles)</b> but with atypical features compared with a “typical” femoral shaft stress fracture.|$|R
30|$|Although many use crossed pin fixation, {{controversy}} persists {{regarding the}} number of Kirschner wires {{to be used for}} fixation. A greater number of wires inserted in each of the <b>epicondyles</b> may offer more stability, but multiple entry points over a small cartilaginous area would increase the chances of skin nipping, nerve entrapment, and pin-tract infections.|$|R
5000|$|The humeral head, {{the larger}} and more superficial, arises from the medial supracondylar ridge {{immediately}} superior to the medial <b>epicondyle</b> of the humerus, and from the common flexor tendon (which arises from the medial <b>epicondyle).</b>|$|E
50|$|Each condyle is surmounted by an elevation, the <b>epicondyle.</b> The medial <b>epicondyle</b> {{is a large}} convex {{eminence}} {{to which}} the tibial collateral ligament of the knee-joint is attached. At its upper part is the adductor tubercle and behind it is a rough impression which gives origin to the medial head of the gastrocnemius. The lateral <b>epicondyle</b> which is smaller and less prominent than the medial, gives attachment to the fibular collateral ligament of the knee-joint.|$|E
50|$|The supracondylar {{process of}} the humerus (also known as an avian spur) is a bony {{projection}} on the anteromedial aspect of the upper arm bone (humerus), about 5 cm above the medial <b>epicondyle.</b> It is directed downward, forward and medially pointing to the medial <b>epicondyle.</b> It is an anatomical variation which occurs in about one percent of all people. A fibrous band, Struthers ligament, may connect this process to the medial <b>epicondyle.</b>|$|E

30|$|During the scan, {{the subject}} {{was placed in a}} supine {{position}} with their knee in a relaxed and extended position. Axial slices perpendicular to the femoral long axis in which the <b>epicondyles</b> were the most prominent were used to place points 1 – 8. Oblique slices were created by resampling the image stack in order to be orthogonal to the axial plane; points 9 and 10 were placed on these images.|$|R
40|$|An {{anatomical}} {{study of}} the brachial portion of the radial nerve with surgical implications is proposed. Thirty specimens of arm from 20 fresh cadavers (11 male, 9 female) were {{used to examine the}} topographical relations of the radial nerve with reference to the following anatomical landmarks: acromion angle, medial and lateral <b>epicondyles,</b> point of division between the lateral and long heads of the triceps brachii, lateral intermuscular septum, site of division of the radial nerve into its superficial and posterior interosseous branches and entry and exit point of the posterior interosseous branch into the supinator muscle. The mean distances between the acromion angle and the medial and lateral levels of crossing the posterior aspect of the humerus were 109 (+/- 11) and 157 (+/- 11) mm, respectively. The mean length and calibre of the nerve in the groove were 59 (+/- 4) and 6 (+/- 1) mm, respectively. The division of the lateral and long heads of the triceps was found at a mean distance of 126 (+/- 13) mm from the acromion angle. The mean distances between the lateral point of crossing the posterior aspect of the humerus and the medial and lateral <b>epicondyles</b> were 125 (+/- 13) and 121 (+/- 13) mm, respectively. The mean distance between the lateral point of crossing the posterior aspect of the humerus and the entry point in the lateral intermuscular septum (LIS) was 29 (+/- 6) mm. The mean distances between the entry point of the nerve in the LIS and the medial and lateral <b>epicondyles</b> were 133 (+/- 14) and 110 (+/- 23) mm, respectively. Our study provides reliable and objective data of surgical anatomy of the radial nerve which should be always kept in mind by surgeons approaching to the surgery of the arm, in order to avoid iatrogenic injuries...|$|R

30|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} variations of recommended pinning techniques. Swenson [3], Flynn et al. [4], and Nacht et al. [5], using two pins, inserted medially and laterally through the medial and lateral <b>epicondyles.</b> The risk of iatrogenic ulnar nerve injury is always a concern during insertion of the medial pin with a reported incidence of 2 – 8 % [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. Arino et al. [11] recommended inserting the two wires through the lateral <b>epicondyles</b> to avoid ulnar nerve injury. Biomechanically, fixation provided by the two lateral pins is less secure, as it may allow rotation of the fracture, with the medial column rotating posteriorly. It {{was found that the}} torque required to produce 10 ° of rotation is 37 % less with the use of two lateral parallel pins than with the use of medial and lateral pins [4, 12]. It has been argued that insertion of two lateral cross-pins will provide a biomechanically stable fixation with avoiding the risk of ulnar nerve injury [13]. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the results of percutaneous lateral cross-wiring technique in treatment of unstable or irreducible type II and III supracondylar humeral fractures in children.|$|R
50|$|When in {{anatomical}} position {{there are four}} main bony landmarks of the elbow. At {{the lower part of}} the humerus are the medial and lateral <b>epicondyles,</b> on the side closest to the body (medial) and on the side away from the body (lateral) surfaces. The third landmark is the olecranon found at the head of the ulna. These lie on a horizontal line called the Hueter line. When the elbow is flexed, they form an equilateral triangle called the Hueter triangle.|$|R
30|$|While closed {{manipulation}} and percutaneous Kirschner wire stabilization is the accepted treatment of displaced supracondylar fractures of the humerus in children, {{there is still}} argument on the optimal configuration of those Kirschner wires. Danielsson and Pettersson [20] used only one pin and noted a loss of reduction. Swenson [3], Flynn et al. [4], and Nacht et al. [5] have, using two pins, introduced through the medial and lateral <b>epicondyles,</b> respectively. The two-wire cross-fixation is {{the most commonly used}} and good results have been reported, but injury of the ulnar nerve when inserting the medial wire has been documented ranging from 2 to 8 % [6, 7, 8, 9, 10].|$|R

50|$|Though {{the elbow}} is {{similarly}} adapted for stability through {{a wide range}} of pronation-supination and flexion-extension in all apes, there are some minor differences. In arboreal apes such as orangutans, the large forearm muscles originating on the <b>epicondyles</b> of the humerus generate significant transverse forces on the elbow joint. The structure to resist these forces is a pronounced keel on the trochlear notch on the ulna, which is more flattened in, for example, humans and gorillas. In knuckle-walkers, on the other hand, the elbow has to deal with large vertical loads passing through extended forearms and the joint is therefore more expanded to provide larger articular surfaces perpendicular to those forces.|$|R
30|$|After {{weeks of}} studies, the patient still {{maintained}} symptoms. At a second clinical evaluation, the patient endorsed some tenderness at rest. The patient {{was instructed to}} exercise, during which she performed burpees, push-ups, and medicine ball tosses until pain and tightness in the forearm were felt (at 10  min). She then continued 5  min longer, totaling 15  min of exercise. Upon evaluation, the surgeon found discoloration of the right forearm, tenderness to touch over both <b>epicondyles,</b> and pain in the flexor and extensor compartments. The patient also presented with stiffness {{and a feeling of}} heavy pressure within the right forearm. Consequently, a bilateral pre-exercise and post-exercise MRI was ordered to work up possible exercise-induced compartment syndrome.|$|R
50|$|The elbow {{includes}} prominent landmarks {{such as the}} olecranon (the bony prominence at {{the very}} tip of the elbow), the elbow pit, the lateral and medial <b>epicondyles,</b> and the elbow joint. The name for the elbow in Latin is cubitus, and so the word cubital is used in some elbow-related terms, as in cubital nodes for example.The elbow is specific to humans and other primates. The elbow joint is the is the synovial hinge joint between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the forearm and hand to be moved {{towards and away from}} the body. The superior radioulnar joint shares the joint capsule with the elbow joint but plays no functional role at the elbow.|$|R
