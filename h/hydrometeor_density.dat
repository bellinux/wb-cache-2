40|$|A simple {{scheme that}} is based on the shape and {{intensity}} of the radar bright band is used to infer the density of hydrometeors just above the freezing level in Sahelian mesoscale convective systems (MCS). Four MCS jointly observed by a ground-based X-band radar and by an instrumented aircraft as part of the Megha-Tropiques algorithm-validation campaign during August 2010 in Niamey, Niger, are analyzed. The instrumented aircraft (with a 94 -GHz radar and various optical probes on board) provided mass-diameter laws for the particles sampled during the flights. The mass-diameter laws derived from the ground-radar vertical profile of reflectivity (VPR) for each flight are compared with those derived from the airborne measurements. The density laws derived by both methods are consistent and encourage further use of the simple VPR scheme to quantify <b>hydrometeor</b> <b>density</b> laws and their variability for various analyses (microphysical processes and icy-hydrometeor scattering and radiative properties) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{data from}} Japan and the U. S. (the Virginia Precipitation Scatter Experiment) show {{excellent}} {{agreement between the}} two-component rain scatter model predictions and bistatic scatter measurements. In employing the model, all the scattering geometries should be classified as backscattering as defined by Crane (1974). The forward scatter model should only be used for great circle paths with both antennas pointed at the horizon and {{at each other in}} a typical troposcatter communication system geometry. The forward scatter model can also be used for main-lobe, side-lobe coupling when one antenna is pointed toward the other along the great circle path. The forward scatter observations made over the Prospect Hill - Mt Tug path show that the two-component model is incomplete. Much stronger signals were observed at Ku-band than expected based on simultaneous C-band measurements. The discrepancies may be due to: (1) scattering by ice/snow at height (posssible in April) at the 1 km height of the scattering volume), (2) the coherent effects of turbulent fluctuations in the <b>hydrometeor</b> number <b>densities</b> and (3) errors in the modeling of the statistical relationship between attenuation along the path and scattering in the common volume...|$|R
40|$|Precipitation Radar (PR) {{on board}} the TRMM {{satellite}} shows that the average height of 30 dBz in convective rain areas of the tropics varies significantly from one region to the other. When the convection is weak this height is shallow and when convection is strong this height extends deeper into the troposphere. The brightness temperature (Tb) measured by the microwave radiometer by itself does not reflect this nature of convection satisfactorily. Radiative transfer simulations of Tbs reveal {{that this could be}} due to the variations in the vertical distribution of optically active water and ice <b>hydrometeors</b> and their <b>density,</b> shape, and size. These variations are not coupled uniquely to the strength of the convective updrafts, and as a result the Tbs do not reflect properly the convective strength indicated by PR. Because of this deficiency in the Tbs the rain rate deduced from them differs from that of PR. For this reason, to improve the estimation of rain rate we have developed an empirical method. In this method a parameter based on the areal extent of the Tbs that exceed a certain magnitude is included along with the Tbs. Rain rate deduced with this approach is better correlated with that of PR when compared to the current Version 5 operational algorithm. The percentage of rain volume as a function of rain rate, for a given region of 5 deg lat. X 5 deg long. over a period of three months, deduced from this method, is also in better agreement with that of the PR...|$|R
40|$|A non-hydrostatic, {{three-dimensional}} cloud {{model was}} {{used in conjunction with}} a radiative transfer model to study the sensitivity o f the model-simulated storms and their remotely-sensed characteristics to the microphysical parameterizations used in the cloud model. Understanding the sensitivity o f the cloud-radiation databases to the assumptions that went into their building is o f particular importance since such cloudradiation databases are extensively used in the development o f algorithms for retrieval o f rainfall and latent heating from microwave observations o f precipitating systems. This study was conducted with the intent to shed more light on how the microphysical parameter choices affect not just a particular storm characteristic but the storm's microand macro-structure and evolution. Three types o f sensitivity tests were performed. The first evaluated sensitivity to the choice o f microphysical parameterization scheme. For that purpose tw o microphysical schemes were compared - Tao's and Perrier's. Both schemes share the parameterizations. Their main differences are in the treatment of the cloud ice initiation processes and the subsequent growth of snow. The second test evaluated the sensitivity of modeled storms to the selection of ice aggregation parameters and to the assumed number of ice crystals that are activated at 0 ? C. The third test evaluated the sensitivity of simulated storms to the selection of the <b>hydrometeor?s</b> descriptive parameters (<b>density,</b> terminal velocity, and particle size distributions). The storm dynamics and remotely?sensed characteristics are affected by the microphysical parameterization philosophies and by the choice of microphysical parameters and hydrometeor descriptive parameters. Different storm characteristics show sensitivity to different microphysical assumptions. This rinding suggests that by using coincidental observations of a variety of storm characteristics {{it would be possible to}} discriminate between simulations and to determine what microphysical setup produces storms that compare best to observations. Being able to reproduce the storm in its entirety will indicate that the complex intercorrelations between the different processes and scales are, indeed, properly represented by the model. This in turn, will give a high fidelity in the rainfall and latent heating retrieval algorithms using cloud model databases...|$|R
40|$|The optical {{extinction}} of a laser due to scattering of particles {{is a well-known}} phenomenon. In a laboratory environment, this physical principle {{is known as the}} Beer-Lambert law, and is often used to measure the concentration of scattering particles in a fluid or gas. This method has been experimentally shown to be a usable means to measure the dust density from a rocket plume interaction with the lunar surface. Using the same principles and experimental arrangement, this technique can be applied to hydrometeor size distributions, and for launch-pad operations, specifically as a passive hail detection and measurement system. Calibration of a hail monitoring system is a difficult process. In the past, it has required comparison to another means of measuring <b>hydrometeor</b> size and <b>density.</b> Using a technique recently developed for estimating the density of surface dust dispersed during a rocket landing, measuring the {{extinction of}} a laser passing through hail (or dust in the rocket case) yields an estimate of the second moment of the particle cloud, and hydrometeor size distribution in the terrestrial meteorological case. With the exception of disdrometers, instruments that measure rain and hail fall make indirect measurements of the drop-size distribution. Instruments that scatter microwaves off of hydrometeors, such as the WSR- 88 D (Weather Surveillance Radar 88 Doppler), vertical wind profilers, and microwave disdrometers, measure the sixth moment of the drop size distribution (DSD). By projecting a laser onto a target, changes in brightness of the laser spot against the target background during rain and hail yield a measurement of the DSD's second moment by way of the Beer-Lambert law. In order to detect the laser attenuation within the 8 -bit resolution of most camera image arrays, a minimum path length is required. Depending on the intensity of the hail fall rate for moderate to heavy rainfall, a laser path length of 100 m is sufficient to measure variations in optical extinction using a digital camera. For hail fall only, the laser path may be shorter because of greater scattering due to the properties of hailstones versus raindrops. A photodetector may replace the camera in automated installations. Laser-based rain and hail measurement systems are available, but they are based on measuring the interruption of a thin laser beam, thus counting individual hydrometeors. These systems are true disdrometers since they also measure size and velocity. The method reported here is a simple method, requiring far less processing, {{but it is not a}} disdrometer...|$|R
