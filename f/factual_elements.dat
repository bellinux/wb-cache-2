40|$|Polazište analize pojma i pravne prirode državine su deset pojava (počev od dodira sa stvari do nasledničke državine) koje se sreću u oba kontinentalnoevropska koncepta državine. Legalna definicija državine kao faktičke vlasti nema veliku upotrebnu vrednost. Raznovrsnost slučajeva državine i njenih funkcija, a ni klasični način definisanja nisu prepreka za jedinstveni pojam. On je bolje rešenje nego usko definisati državinu, a druge pojave odrediti kao fikcije državine ili ih pravno izjednačavati sa njom. Autorova funkcionalna definicija nije, kako objašnjava, ni tautološka, a ni smetnja u delu u kom je negativna. Faktička vlast nije specifikum pravne ustanove državina. I ona, kao i neke druge stvarnopravne ustanove, spaja faktičko sa pravnim. Jedna njena osobenost je promenljiva priroda prava na državinu, dok su stvarnopravne prirode pravo na zaštitu državine i pravo isljučenja trećih od uticaja na državinu. Autor eksplicira pravo isključenja trećih, koje se ne navodi u zakonodavstvu, praksi i teoriji, a koje je vezivni član između državine i prava na zaštitu državine. Iz neuočavanja da to pravo postoji proističe i tvrdnja da se u posesornom postupku štiti državina tj. fakt, a ne pravo, dok se u stvari štiti pravo isključenja trećih od uticaja na državinu. The article {{discusses}} {{the two of}} the three most widely discussed aspects of possession: the notion of possession and its legal nature. There are numerous inconsistencies and controversies in the theory and the practice of the two civil law (Continental-European) concepts of possession, despite pregnant formulas (possessio = corpus + animus; Besitz = tatsächlicher Sachherrschaft). The author singles out ten phenomena of the factual nature (such as, direct spatial relationship with a thing, temporary impossibility of carrying out of will regarding to a thing, indirect possession, hereditary possession, etc.), that are under both concepts qualified as possession, although sometimes under different names, and analyses the possibility to find a uniform definition of possession. The existing legal definitions, where the physical control over a thing or good is central, are not useful. Some authors argue that the uniform notion of possession is not possible, because of different functions of possession (so called relativity of the notion of possession), or because of diversity of phenomena to which the possession is related, or because the classic definition of possession is not suitable (per genus proximum et differentiam specificam). The author of this article does not support this view and argues that the uniform definition is possible. In his view it presents a better solution than alternative techniques according to which only some factual phenomena (physical control over a thing or good) can be qualified as possession, whereas for the rest of phenomena can be determined that they are legally equalized with a possession. The author builds the uniform notion of possession functionally and determines the possession as a physical control or factual state in regard to a thing or good that can respond to the right of ownership (owner-possession), to another right (limited-right-possession) or to the obligation (obligation-possession) and for those with respect to which the legal rules on possession are appropriate and not those on detention. The author argues that this definition is not tautological or negative, because a distinction should be made between the possession itself and the legal rules on possession (legal regime of possession) and it is about the legal rules that are sufficiently determined. Also there is no doubt which legal rules are rules on detention (legal regime). Regarding legal nature, possession is a fact (physical control or factual state of certain characteristics), whereas a legal institution of possession is a combination of that fact and legal categories – authorities. Possession as a physical control or state is only one, and that, a <b>factual</b> <b>element</b> of a legal institution of possession. When answering the question, what is protected in the proceedings in disputes for disturbance of possession, it is necessary to take three further elements from the structure of institution of possession, which are legal in their nature: the right of possession, the right to exclude the third persons from affecting the possession and the right to protect the possession. <b>Factual</b> <b>element</b> (physical control and factual state) is not, however, a peculiarity of the legal concept of possession, because some other proprietary rights (such as pledge, retention, rent) have in their structure an <b>element</b> of <b>factual</b> nature besides legal elements as well. Other characteristics of the institution of possessions are: persons entitled to property rights (titulars), for example, an owner or a pledgee can not be the owner or the pledgee respectively if {{they do not have the}} right concerned (thus the right of ownership or the right of pledge); but a possessor can be the possessor without having the right of possession. Authorities that constitute ownership or other property rights always have the same legal nature, namely, the property law nature, but the right of possession has such a legal nature that has the right, within which it appears. For example, the right of possession has a nature of the law on obligations, if it is the right of a borrower to possession, but the right of possession has a property law nature, if it is the right of a pledgee to possession. Usually it is suggested that a peculiarity of the proceedings in disputes for disturbance of possession lies in the protection of the fact and not in the protection of rights. But the present author disagrees with this view, because one protects also the right in these proceedings: the right to exclude the third persons from affecting the possession. If this right is infringed, there is the right of the judicial protection of the possession as well as the right of protection of possession out of the court. This right is peculiar among other rights, because it is recognised also in cases when the possessor does not have the basic right in regard to a thing or the right of the possession or even when his possession violates the possessory right of another person. The third basic question on possession is usually formulated as follows: why is the fact protected in the proceedings in disputes for disturbance of possession even if it is not based on right? Instead, it is more appropriate to formulate this third question as follows: why we acknowledge and protect the right to exclude the third persons from affecting the possession in the proceedings in disputes for disturbance of possessions even when this right is based on none of rights to possession...|$|R

Sadler applies the Fulfordian account to diagnostic manuals to resolve their inconsistencies. I find Fulford’s initial and later arguments incongruent. His account is also too evaluative given the absence of any restrictions on the place and role of values. Furthermore, it is relatively easy to conclude that given the prominent position of values, facts need not exist as they are essentially evaluative terms with merely an overt factual connotation. Moreover, values provide the benchmark against which facts are assessed (for their degree of value-ladenness) and identified; and this makes facts dependent on and a subclass of values...|$|R

40|$|Research {{into the}} {{effectiveness}} of comic books as health education tools overwhelmingly consists of studies evaluating the information learnt {{as a result of}} reading the comic, for example using preintervention and postintervention questionnaires. In essence, these studies evaluate comics in the same way in which a patient information leaflet might be evaluated, but they fail to evaluate the narrative element of comics. Health information comics have the potential to do much more than simply convey facts about an illness; they can also support patients in dealing with the social and psychological aspects of a condition.

40|$|Continuing {{a season}} of {{exhibitions}} investigating parallels between art and cinema, g 39 presents a new group exhibition inspired by the film Short Cuts (1993). Directed by Robert Altman and drawn from nine short stories and a poem by Raymond Carver, the film traces the actions of twenty-two principal characters, both in parallel and at occasional loose points of connection. Short Cuts does not conform to traditional narrative Hollywood cinema. There is narrative, to be sure, though {{the manner in which}} narrative operates moves far and away from classical Hollywood style. The movie employs a non-linear, dynamic and somewhat negotiable framework of stories. This show brings together work from Tim Freeman, Henry Gwiazda, Rick Niebe and Lisa Stansbie, who all offer their own hypertext on a variety of narratives. Like the film, the works shown here offer parallel themes and fiction within each of the works, depending on and determined by the interpretation of the viewer. Lisa Stansbie continues an exploration of sculpture, film and photography through the use of Airfix model kits, informed by ambiguous narratives and stories. Through the use of out-dated analogue film stock and digital manipulation, Wales-based Tim Freeman’s Anti Nature uses un-doctored photographic images alongside manipulated ones, raising questions of the <b>factual</b> and fictitious <b>elements</b> of photography. Rick Niebe focuses his attention on ordinary anonymous images as well as on fragments from cinematographic history whilst Henry Gwiazda uses CGI moving image informed by his sound composition practice, aiming to disorient the viewer whilst playing a game between memory and formation of new meanings.
