40|$|Premature {{failure of}} {{concrete}} pavement contraction <b>joint</b> <b>seals</b> {{is an ongoing}} and costly problem for the Iowa Department of Transportation. Several <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> test sections consisting of variations in sawing methods, joint cleaning techniques, sealant installation, and sealant types have been established {{over the past few}} years. Laboratory analysis and field inspections were done {{as a part of the}} tests, and core samples were taken for laboratory adhesion pull tests. Such methods often cover specifically small areas and may not expose hidden failures. Some tests are also labor-intensive and destructive, especially that of coring. An innovative, nondestructive, broad coverage <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> tester that yields quick results has been designed and developed for evaluation of pavement <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> performance. The Iowa vacuum <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> tester (IA-VAC) applies a low vacuum above a <b>joint</b> <b>seal</b> that has been spray-covered with a foaming water solution. Any unsealed area or leak that exists along the joint will become quickly and clearly visible by the development of bubbles at the leak point. By analyzing the results from the IA-VAC tests, information on the number and types of leaks can be obtained; such information will help identify the source of the problem and direct efforts toward a solution...|$|R
40|$|Most {{pavement}} contraction <b>joint</b> <b>seals</b> in Iowa, in general, {{have been}} performing {{in less than}} a satisfactory manner. The effective life of the seals, in maintaining a watertight joint, has been only from two to five years. In search of improvements, research was proposed to evaluate preformed neoprene <b>joint</b> <b>seals.</b> The performance of those seals was to be compared mainly with the hot poured rubberized asphalt sealants and cold applied silicone sealants or other sealants commonly used at the time this research began. Joint designs and methods of sawing were also investigated. All evaluations were done in new portland cement concrete (PCC) pavements. Three projects were initially selected and each included a research section of <b>joint</b> <b>sealing.</b> Some additional sites were later added for evaluation. Several joint sealants were evaluated at each research site. The various sites included high, medium and low levels of traffic. Evaluations were done over a five-year period. Neoprene <b>joint</b> <b>seals</b> provided better performance than hot or cold field formed joints...|$|R

40|$|The {{procedures}} for regeneration of the structurized <b>sealing</b> <b>compounds</b> on {{base of the}} thiokol by the compounds of the thiazole class and scientific-technical bases of this process have been developed firstly. The hypothesis about regeneration mechanism of the structurized <b>sealing</b> <b>compounds</b> according to which the damage of the polymer <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> base is realized both according to the disulphide bonds and acetal ones has been proposed.

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} drive towards {{improvements}} and achieving success in effective and long term sealing of portland cement concrete pavement contraction joints. A variety of <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> products and procedures have been applied in Iowa in search of improvements in seal performance. Hot poured rubberized asphalt products were mainly used for <b>sealing</b> all <b>joints</b> in earlier years for highways. In the 1980 s, silicone sealant products were becoming popular, especially for the major highways. As {{a high level of}} sealant performance was not achieved from silicones in Iowa conditions, other sealing products were tried. Preformed neoprene compression seals are being tried as a substitution for silicone sealants. Due to high costs of materials and installation with neoprene seals, the search for improvements through other <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> products and procedures continued. An agreement was made with Phoenix, North America, Inc., to provide and install preformed Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) compression <b>joint</b> <b>seals.</b> The research site was a 600 ft (183 m) test section of northbound I- 29 in Pottawattamie County, Iowa.

50|$|Pavement {{technology}} is still evolving, albeit in not easily noticed increments.

40|$|Interlayer cooling {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to enable heat removal scaling in true 3 D integration. This technology will unavoidably expose tier interconnects to coolant. If using electrically conductive liquids, such as water based coolants, the interconnects require a sealing mechanism to protect from short-circuiting. As an efficient technological solution we present a concentric ring sealing, realized around the interconnect in the very same alloy, thereby forming a joint of its own. We compare different aspect ratios of upper and lower joining parts, as well as single <b>joint</b> <b>sealing</b> and multiple <b>joint</b> <b>sealing.</b> We demonstrate the post-bonding states of the sealing using CuSnAg, AuSn transient liquid phase bonding (TLPB) and Cu-Cu thermos-compression bonding.

40|$|The joint {{between two}} lanes of asphalt {{pavement}} {{is often the}} first area of a roadway which shows signs of deterioration and requires maintenance. As the final lift of hot asphalt is being placed in a construction project, it is being forced p against the adjoining lane of cold asphalt, forming the longitudinal joint. The mating of the two lanes, to form a high quality seal, is often not fully successful and later results in premature stripping or raveling as water enters the unsealed joint. The application of a hot poured rubberized asphaltic joint sealant along the joint face in {{the final stage of}} construction should help to form a watertight <b>joint</b> <b>seal.</b> A new product, especially formulated for the longitudinal joint in asphalt pavements was proposed to improve <b>joint</b> <b>sealing.</b> The following describes the experimental application of the new product, Crafco, PN 34524...|$|R

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of a cooperation project, ceramic components of alumina, Al 2 O 3, were sealed in a gastight manner for chemical applications using a <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> based on ceramic raw materials. The sealing is adapted to the Al 2 O 3 ceramic with respect to expansion coefficient and wettability and it is inert, mechanically stable, chemically resistant and above all gastight at application temperatures of approx. 1000 degreesC. This was achieved with high reproducibility by a composition in the SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 - CaO-K 2 O quaternary system. The ceramic <b>sealing</b> <b>compound</b> is selectively crystallized by adequate temperature control and shows then the required high temperature resistance. The strengths achieved are sufficient for the planned application as a sealing material for a ceramic microreactor. The temperature cycling resistance and the thermal shock resistance are also adapted to Al 2 O 3. Additional tests of commercial glass sealants were carried out to evaluate the results obtained.
