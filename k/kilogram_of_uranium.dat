40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "Since the 1940 s, one mission of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessor agencies has been processing uranium {{as a source of}} nuclear material for defense and commercial purposes. A key step in this process is the enrichment of natural uranium, which increases its concentration of uranium- 235, the isotope of uranium that undergoes fission to release enormous amounts of energy. Before it can be enriched, natural uranium must be chemically converted into uranium hexafluoride. The enrichment process results in two principal products: (1) enriched uranium hexafluoride, which can be further processed for specific uses, such as nuclear weapons or fuel for nuclear power plants; and (2) leftover "tails" of uranium hexafluoride. These tails are also known as depleted uranium because the material is depleted in uranium- 235 compared with natural uranium. Since 1993, uranium enrichment activities at DOE-owned uranium enrichment plants have been performed by the U. S. Enrichment Corporation (USEC), formerly a wholly owned government corporation that was privatized in 1998. However, DOE still maintains approximately 700, 000 metric tons of depleted uranium tails in about 63, 000 metal cylinders in storage yards at its Paducah, Kentucky, and Portsmouth, Ohio, enrichment plants. It must safely maintain these cylinders because the tails are dangerous to human health and the environment. Uranium hexafluoride is radioactive and forms extremely corrosive and potentially lethal compounds if it contacts water. DOE also maintains large inventories of natural and enriched uranium that are also surplus to the department's needs. Tails have historically been viewed as a waste product because considerable enrichment processing is required to further extract the remaining useful quantities of uranium- 235. In the past, low uranium prices meant that these enrichment services would cost more than the relatively small amount of uranium- 235 extracted would be worth. However, an approximately tenfold increase in uranium prices [...] from approximately $ 21 per <b>kilogram</b> <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> in the form of uranium hexafluoride in November 2000 to about $ 200 per kilogram in February 2008 [...] has potentially made it profitable to re-enrich some tails to further extract uranium- 235. Even with the current higher uranium prices, however, only DOE's tails with higher concentrations of uranium- 235 (at least 0. 3 percent) could currently be profitably re-enriched, according to industry officials. About one-third of DOE's tails contain uranium- 235 concentrations at that level or higher. In this context, Congress asked us to determine (1) DOE's potential options for beneficially reusing or indefinitely storing its tails, and (2) the potential value of DOE's tails and factors that affect the value. ...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{demand for}} energy {{will be more}} than 50 % greater by 2030 if governments {{continue}} their present energy policies. Australia is a net exporter of energy, and is well placed to meet this demand. Australia has significant reserves of coal, and has 36 % of the world’s low cost uranium reserves. This paper by Stewart Smith focuses on the role of uranium and nuclear power to meet the world’s rising demand for energy. In 2004, uranium was produced in 19 countries. Just two countries, Australia and Canada, accounted for 51 % of world production. Australia has the largest reserves of low cost uranium in the world. At the end of 2004, a total of 440 commercial nuclear reactors were operating, requiring about 67, 320 tonnes of uranium. Worldwide, identified resources of uranium are sufficient for some 85 years at current usage rates. Advanced reactor technologies involving the recycling of used fuel could extend nuclear resources for thousands of years. The process of nuclear fission in elements such as uranium produces heat. In a nuclear reactor, this heat is used to generate steam, which drives a generator to produce electricity. Nuclear fission is an extremely potent source of energy. The energy released by the fission of one <b>kilogram</b> <b>of</b> <b>uranium</b> in a typical reactor is equivalent to that released by about 22, 000 kg of coal. Uranium ore is extracted from the earth in much the same manner as other minerals. The ore is then milled to produce uranium oxide, or ‘yellow cake’. This is the product that Australia exports. However, uranium oxide cannot be simply fed into a nuclear power station like coal to produce steam. It must be first converted into uranium hexafluoride, enriched, and fabricated into fuel rods. There are many different types of nuclear reactors. The paper explains their operation and differences. More recently, advanced nuclear reactors are being developed with commissioning dates from 2015 expected. Nuclear waste is often cited as the most important unresolved issue concerning nuclear energy. It is claimed that there is a broad scientific consensus that high level radioactive waste can be safely stored in geological repositories. However, critics of this view note the long time frames involved and that geological landforms change over time. The economics of nuclear power have been well studied. It can be concluded that in a liberalised electricity market, new nuclear power stations are unlikely to be built without some form of government assistance. This is due to their high capital cost, uncertain construction costs, and the fact that private investors are likely to require a substantial risk premium over coal and gas fired power stations to finance at least the first few nuclear plants. The Commonwealth Government has commissioned two separate reviews into the role of the nuclear fuel cycle in Australia. In contrast, the NSW Government has stated that legislation introduced in 1986 prohibiting uranium mining or the construction of a nuclear power station will remain...|$|E
