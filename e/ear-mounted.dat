5000|$|Without Peter's presence, Walter {{has even}} {{less of a}} grip of reality, {{becoming}} agoraphobic, afraid to leave the lab, hypersensitive to germs {{that may or may}} not be there, and prone to destructive [...] "episodes". In order to cope with this, he has Astrid examine crime scenes while wearing an <b>ear-mounted</b> microphone and video camera, while he watches. He also sets up a bed in the lab, with an FBI agent stationed outside whenever he sleeps. Olivia appears to have a calming effect on him, and their relationship is more gentle and crutch-like than in the original timeline.|$|E
50|$|Pince-nez {{spectacles}} {{were worn}} by {{both men and}} women. Since they can be uncomfortable to wear for extended periods if the wrong bridge size is chosen, and also because the constant wearing of glasses was out of fashion at the time, pince-nez were often suspended from a ribbon or chain worn around the neck, tied to the buttonhole of a lapel, or attached to a special <b>ear-mount</b> or to a hair-pin. Women often used a special brooch-like device pinned to the clothing, which would automatically retract the line to which the glasses were attached {{when they were not}} in use.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} year, Space Police {{was also}} revived, becoming Space Police II, {{to oppose the}} new Blacktron. The set designs featured black and grey with transparent green canopies and red trim. The standardized jail cells from the original were retained, though only three vehicles could accept them. The theme also lacked a permanent installation like Space Police I's Space Lock-Up Isolation Base. However, {{it was the first}} Space theme to replace the standard Lego smiley face minifigure head with a more complex print (in this case, the face augmented by a fringe of hair and an <b>ear-mounted</b> microphone). Finally, Space Police II ships were known for being under-armed; several vehicles sported no overt weapons (such as the Galactic Chief, whose epaulet-wearing pilot is armed with only a hand-held blaster that might actually be a megaphone), and the others featured only two small cockpit-mounted weapons (including the theme's heavyweight multi-module spaceship, the Galactic Mediator).|$|E
5000|$|In early 1950, at age 55, Kimball, who {{had never}} smoked or used tobacco, began {{experiencing}} persistent hoarseness and, after a physical examination, underwent a biopsy of a white spot in his throat. The biopsy caused some brief voice impairment, and indicated that Kimball had a throat infection but not cancer. In late 1956, Kimball's hoarseness returned, coupled with occasional bleeding {{in the back of}} his throat. Kimball's physician sent him to New York City to meet with Dr. Hayes Martin (1892 - 1977), an expert on cancers of the head and neck. Martin performed another biopsy, which indicated [...] "borderline malignancy", and in early 1957 Martin recommended immediate surgery. Kimball had neglected to seek approval from church president David O. McKay regarding his 1957 biopsy, a procedure which in the 1950s could itself cause permanent vocal damage. He felt that as an apostle he should have sought McKay's approval before undergoing surgical procedures which could render him incapable of fulfilling apostolic duties. McKay stated that he believed Kimball could still serve as an apostle even if he underwent a complete laryngectomy, and advised him to go forward with the procedure. Martin subsequently surgically removed one of Kimball's vocal cords and half of the other, leaving him barely able to speak above a hoarse whisper. After several weeks of enforced silence, Kimball slowly recovered, and by November 1957 was allowed by his physician to resume speaking in public.

40|$|Background Satellite {{telemetry}} studies {{provide information}} that {{is critical to the}} conservation and management of species affected by ecological change. Here we report on the performance and retention of two types (SPOT- 227 and SPOT- 305 A) of <b>ear-mounted</b> Argos-linked satellite transmitters (i. e., platform transmitter terminal, or PTT) deployed on free-ranging polar bears in Eastern Greenland, Baffin Bay, Kane Basin, the southern Beaufort Sea, and the Chukchi Sea during 2007 – 2013. Results Transmissions from 142 out of 145 PTTs deployed on polar bears were received for an average of 69. 3  days. The average functional longevity, defined as the number of days they transmitted while still attached to polar bears, for SPOT- 227 was 56. 8  days and for SPOT- 305 A was 48. 6  days. Thirty-four of the 142 (24 %) PTTs showed signs of being detached before they stopped transmitting, indicating that tag loss was an important aspect of tag failure. Furthermore, 10 of 26 (38 %) bears that were re-observed following application of a PTT had a split ear pinna, suggesting that some transmitters were detached by force. All six PTTs that were still on bears upon recapture had lost the antenna, which indicates that antenna breakage was a significant contributor to PTT failure. Finally, only nine of the 142 (6 %) PTTs—three of which were still attached to bears—had a final voltage reading close to the value indicating battery exhaustion. This suggests that battery exhaustion was not a major factor in tag performance. Conclusions The average functional longevity of approximately 2  months for <b>ear-mounted</b> PTTs (this study) is poor compared to PTT collars fitted to adult female polar bears, which can last for several years. Early failure of the <b>ear-mounted</b> PTTs appeared to be caused primarily by detachment from the ear or antenna breakage. We suggest that much smaller and lighter <b>ear-mounted</b> transmitters are necessary {{to reduce the risk of}} tissue irritation, tissue damage, and tag detachment, and with a more robust antenna design. Our results are applicable to other tag types (e. g., iridium and VHF systems) and to research on other large mammals that cannot wear radio collars...|$|E
40|$|The {{working memory}} plays an {{important}} role in successfully overcoming adverse listening conditions andshould consequently be considered when designing and testing hearing aids. A number of studies have established therelationship between hearing in noise and working memory involvement, but with the Sentence-final Word Identificationand Recall (SWIRL) test, it is possible to show that working memory is also involved in listening under favorableconditions and that noise reduction has a positive influence in situation with very little noise. Although the capacity of theworking memory is a finite individual size, its involvement can differ with fatigue and other factors and individualizationof hearing aids should take this into account to obtain the best performance. A way of individually adapting hearing aidsis based on changes in the electrical activity of the brain (EEG). Here we present the possibilities that arise from usingEEG and show that <b>ear-mounted</b> electrodes is able to record useful EEG that can be explored for individualization ofhearing aids.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} novel method for mapping and {{localization}} in indoor environments using a wearable gesture interface. The <b>ear-mounted</b> FreeDigiter device {{consists of an}} infrared proximity sensor and a dual axis accelerometer. A user builds a topological map of a new environment by walking through the environment wearing our device. The accelerometer is used to identify footsteps while the proximity sensor detects doorways. While mapping an environment, finger gestures are used to label detected doorways. Once a map is constructed, a particle filter is employed to track a user walking through the mapped environment while wearing the device. In this tracking mode, the device {{can be used as}} a context-aware gesture interface by responding to finger gestures differently according to which room the user occupies. We present experimental results for both mapping and localization in a home environment. ...|$|E

When given a 3 D location, El-E can autonomously approach the location and pick up a nearby object. Based on interviews of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), we have developed and tested three distinct interfaces that enable a user to provide a 3 D location to El-E and thereby select an object to be manipulated: an <b>ear-mounted</b> laser pointer, a hand-held laser pointer, and a touch screen interface. Within this paper, we present the results from a user study comparing these three user interfaces with a total of 134 trials involving eight patients with varying levels of impairment recruited from the Emory ALS Clinic. During this study, participants used the three interfaces to select everyday objects to be approached, grasped, and lifted off of the ground. The three interfaces enabled motor impaired users to command a robot to pick up an object with a 94. 8 % success rate overall after less than 10 minutes of learning to use each interface. On average, users selected objects 69 % more quickly with the laser pointer interfaces than with the touch screen interface. We also found substantial variation in user preference. With respect to the Revised ALS Functional Rating Scale (ALSFRS-R), users with greater upper-limb mobility tended to prefer the hand-held laser pointer, while those with less upper-limb mobility tended to prefer the <b>ear-mounted</b> laser pointer. Despite the extra efficiency of the laser pointer interfaces, three patients preferred the touch screen interface, which has unique potential for manipulating remote objects out of the user’s line of sight. In summary, these results indicate that robots can enhance accessibility by supporting multiple interfaces. Furthermore, this work demonstrates that the communication of 3 D locations during human-robot interaction can serve as a powerful abstraction barrier that supports distinct interfaces to assistive robots while using identical, underlying robotic functionality...|$|E
