500|$|Digital Spy {{mentioned}} Body Count, Terminator 2: The Arcade Game, and Mad Dog McCree as Menacer's other notable games. Terminator 2 was {{the first}} external game {{to work with the}} Menacer, the only one confirmed as of December 1992. Terminator programmers, Probe Software, later began work on another Menacer-compatible game. Terminator 2 has a two-player mode that uses one Menacer light gun and one controller. Sega Force reported that Menacer gameplay registered faster than the Genesis controller. Mad Dog McCree, a live action Wild West shoot 'em up for the Sega CD, used either a controller or a choice of several light guns: the Menacer, the Konami <b>Justifier,</b> or the game developer's own compatible light gun. In the 1994 Body Count, the player defends Earth from an alien invasion. The Irish Times wrote that the game is [...] "ideally suited for the ... Menacer" [...] and is [...] "to be avoided" [...] otherwise. The Menacer is also compatible with Corpse Killer and American Laser Games' other titles, such as Who Shot Johnny Rock? The light gun does not work with Konami's Lethal Enforcers games or Snatcher, which use the Konami <b>Justifier.</b>|$|E
500|$|Other {{peripherals}} {{were released}} to add functionality. The Menacer is a wireless, infrared light gun peripheral used with compatible games. [...] Other third parties created light gun peripherals for the Genesis, {{such as the}} American Laser Games Pistol and the Konami <b>Justifier.</b> [...] Released for art creation software, the Sega Mega Mouse features three buttons and is only compatible with a few games, such as Eye of the Beholder.

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} {{paper we propose a}} system of propositional logic for {{reasoning}} about justification, truthmaking, and the connection between <b>justifiers</b> and truthmakers. The logic of justification and truthmaking is developed according to the fundamental ideas introduced by Artemov. <b>Justifiers</b> and truthmakers are treated in a similar way, exploiting the intuition that <b>justifiers</b> provide epistemic grounds for propositions to be considered true, while truthmakers provide ontological grounds for propositions to be true. This system of logic is then applied both for interpreting the notorious definition of knowledge as justified true belief and for ad-vancing a new solution to Gettier counterexamples to this standard definition...|$|R

60|$|Third. It is {{apparent}} that God is satisfied with Christ's blood for our sins, because he hath declared that he can justify those that believe in, or rely upon, that blood for life, in a way of justice and righteousness--'Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: {{that he might be}} just, and the <b>justifier</b> of him that believeth in Jesus' (Rom 3:24-26).|$|E

But man returned to his wicked way, and then the bright Spirit of Good, who is of us called Osiris, but who has many names, offered himself up for the evil-doing of the race that had dethroned him. And from him and the Divine Mother, of whom all nature is, sprang another spirit who is the Protector of us on earth, as Osiris is our <b>justifier</b> in Amenti.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide an {{intuitive}} semantics for systems of justification logic which allows us to cope with the distinction between implicit and explicit <b>justifiers.</b> The paper is subdivided into three sections. In the first one, the distinction between implicit and explicit <b>justifiers</b> is presented and connected with a proof-theoretic distinction between two ways of interpreting sequences of sentences; that is, as sequences of axioms in a certain set and as proofs constructed from that set of axioms. In the second section, a basic system of justification logic for implicit and explicit <b>justifiers</b> is analyzed and some significant facts about it are proved. In the final section, an adequate semantics is proposed, and the system is proved to be sound and complete whit respect to it...|$|R

60|$|Ans. He ever {{lives to}} make intercession {{for all that}} come unto God by him (Heb 7:25). That is, they shall come out of {{themselves}} to him, and venture their souls on {{what he did and}} suffered when he was on earth, and is doing now in heaven; shall certainly be saved: For he ever lives to save them, that do thus come to the Father by him. And it is, because he spilt his blood for all that shall by the faith of God's elect lay hold upon him. And thus it is written where he saith, 'Being justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, [Mark this] whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness, [that is, to declare God's righteousness] for the remission of sins that are past, through the forbearance of God; to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the <b>justifier</b> of him which believeth [or layeth hold] in Jesus' (Rom 3:24-26).|$|E
60|$|We {{have said}} that Petawanaquat had smoked and pondered deeply in the evenings that winter over his wigwam fire. His {{slightly}} enlightened mind had been busy with those difficult problems about good and evil, God and man, which seem to exercise all earnest souls {{more or less in}} every land, savage as well as civilised. The revenge which he had taken on Mr Ravenshaw was sweet--very sweet, for his indignation against that irascible old gentleman was very bitter; justifiably so, he thought. But the clergyman at Red River had enlightened the red man's conscience, and conscience being once aroused cannot easily be put to sleep again. His reasoning powers told him that the revenge which he had taken was far in excess of the injury which he had received. This was unjust, and conscience told him that injustice was wrong. The great Manitou Himself could not be unjust. Had He not taken the guilt of man on Himself in the person of Jesus, in order that, without injustice, He might be the <b>justifier</b> of sinners? Injustice is wrong, reiterated conscience again and again; but revenge is sweet, thought the Indian.|$|E
6000|$|... 3. I believe, {{that the}} offer of this righteousness, as {{tendered}} in the gospel, is to be received by faith; we still in {{the very act of}} receiving it, judging ourselves sinners in ourselves. 'Oh wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from the body of this death? I thank God through Jesus Christ' (Rom 7:24,25). 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved' (Acts 16:31). The gospel is preached in all nations for the obedience of faith. 'Being justified freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus; whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation, [a sacrifice to appease the displeasure of God] through faith in his blood. To declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past through the forbearance of God; to declare I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the <b>justifier</b> of him which believeth on Jesus' (Rom 3:24-26). 'Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses' (Acts 13:38,39).|$|E

60|$|Ans. Although {{you speak}} this in great derision to faith when it worketh right, yet know that {{therefore}} (seeing you would hear it) I say, therefore hath our Saviour merited pardon, and bestowed it on men freely, and bid them believe or receive it, and have it; that thereby {{they might be}} encouraged to live to him, and love him, and comply with his commandments. 'For scarcely for a righteous man will one die, yet peradventure for a good man some would even dare to die: But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. Much more then, being NOW justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him' (Rom 5). Now, as here {{we are said to}} be justified by his blood, that is, as his blood appeaseth the justice of God; so again, it is said that this blood is set forth by God for us to have faith in it, by the term of a propitiation. 'Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation [or a sacrifice to appease the displeasure of God] through faith in his blood.--To declare at this time his righteousness, that he might be just, and the <b>justifier</b> of him which believeth in Jesus' (Rom 3:25,26).|$|E
60|$|Blood must be pleaded in Christ's intercession, {{because of}} justice, {{and to stop}} {{the mouth of the}} enemy, and also to {{encourage}} us to come to God by him. Justice, since that is of the essence of God, must concur in the salvation of the sinner; but how can that be, since it is said at first, 'In the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely die,' unless a plenary16 satisfaction be made for sin to the pleasing of the mighty God. The enemy also would else never let go his objecting against our salvation. But now God has declared that our salvation is grounded on justice, because merited by blood. And though God needed not to have given his Son to die for us that he might save us, and stop the mouth of the devil in so doing, yet this way of salvation has done both, and so it is declared, we are 'justified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past--to declare, I say, at this time his righteousness: that he might be just, and the <b>justifier</b> of him which believeth in Jesus.' (Rom 3:24,25) So, then, here is also a ground of intercession, even the blood shed for us before.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was with}} them and their {{dispensation}} as this similitude gives you to understand:--Set the case that there be two men who make a covenant that the one should give the other ten thousand sheep on condition the other give him two thousand pound; but forasmuch as the money {{is not to be}} paid down presently, therefore if he that buyeth the sheep will have any of them before the day of payment, the creditor requesteth a surety; and upon the engagement of the surety there is part of the sheep given to the debtor even before the day of payment, but the other at and after. So it is here; Christ covenanted with His Father for His sheep--"I lay down My life for My sheep," [...] saith He--but the money was not to be paid down so soon as the bargain was made, as I have already said, yet some of the sheep were saved even before the money was paid, and that because of the Suretyship of Christ; as it is written, [...] "Being justified," [...] or saved, [...] "freely by His grace through the redemption," [...] or purchase, [...] "that is in Christ Jesus. Whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in His blood, to declare His righteousness for the remission of sins that are past," [...] or the sinners who died in the faith before Christ was crucified, through God's forbearing till the payment was paid; to declare, I say, at this time His righteousness; [...] "that He might be just, and the <b>justifier</b> of him which believeth in Jesus" [...] (Rom 3:24-26).|$|E
