6000|$|At this I {{was moved}} by a sudden fear for Kerner to a softer and more {{pleading}} mood. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> gray man's sleeve and besought him: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Two beers," [...] said I nonchalantly to the barkeeper, {{and while}} he drew them, the Swede and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bar and yearned {{secretly}} for the arm-chairs by the stove.|$|E
60|$|Wiping the {{perspiration}} from my face, I {{made my way}} to {{the forward}} deck. But few people were on board, and quite undisturbed, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> railing to review the situation.|$|E
50|$|Dongting Lake, {{inscribed on}} the Deer Antler Temple WallRains clear and clouds disperse,A bright moon fills the river.Winds subside and waves die down;A single leaf of a ship.Mind awake at midnightWith dreams of past, present and future.Thousands of miles parted;Sadly <b>I</b> <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ship’s windowAnd sleep a little.|$|R
25|$|And when he intimated {{over the}} entrée that the {{wrongdoing}} went further, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall on my inside banquette {{and looked at}} him in frank astonishment.|$|R
6000|$|The breath sighed itself away. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> {{my cheek}} <b>against</b> <b>the</b> unanswering hand, and chafed it with mine. Where now? Where now? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, and a sob {{broke from}} me. Then, in an instant, the passage {{was flooded with}} light, and in the open doorway Giuliana stood all white before me, her arms held out.|$|E
60|$|I stood helplessly {{rooted to}} the spot which I had first {{selected}} upon entering the room. Too weak to stand unsupported, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table. My perverse silence must have astonished the woman, but she talked on loquaciously, appearing not to notice my lack of interest.|$|E
60|$|Thus we {{gained the}} gallery. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stout oaken balustrade, {{and looked down}} into the black pit of the hall, broken in the centre by the circle of light from the two tapers that burnt upon the table. The other torches had all been quenched.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} in the African forest," [...] Maxwell replied simply, as though that were {{sufficient}} explanation. [...] "Thank you, but <b>I</b> would rather <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> railing here." ...|$|R
60|$|Mironsac, Castelroux, and La Fosse stood {{babbling}} around me, but I paid no heed {{either to}} Castelroux's patois or to La Fosse's misquotations of classic authors. The combat had been protracted, {{and the methods}} I had pursued had been of a very exhausting nature. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> now <b>against</b> <b>the</b> porte-cochere, and mopped myself vigorously. Then Saint-Eustache, who was engaged in binding up his principal's arm, called to La Fosse.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{lifted the}} three-hundred-pound stone god, {{and carried him}} {{into the back room}} of the café--the temple, <b>I</b> mean--and <b>leaned</b> him <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall. It was more work than {{bouncing}} three live ones from an all-night Broadway joint on New-Year's Eve.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Jean Marie, {{to be out}} of the way, clambered on to one of the cross- beams that {{supported}} the roof, whilst <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> side wall, as near as I could get to the aperture that served for a window, to avoid the smells, which were overpowering.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{possible}} that either the Indians or Simon Kenton had attempted to cross such a place where one must flounder around with noise enough to proclaim his every movement, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> trunk of a tree fully realizing all the mischief I had wrought.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rail, dismissing premonitions of disaster, I {{could not}} help {{thinking}} of Miss West below, bustling and humming {{as she made her}} little nest. And from her my thought drifted on to the everlasting mystery of woman. Yes, I, with all the futuristic contempt for woman, am ever caught up afresh by the mystery of woman.|$|E
60|$|As <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my face <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bed, his feeble hand {{could just}} move itself {{enough to touch}} me. I hope the touch was penitent. It tried to hold my dress and keep hold, but the fingers were too weak to close.|$|R
60|$|That {{finished}} him, and I am free {{to admit}} that I was mighty glad of it. There was a great tree close behind me, and, stepping within its shade, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> it, wiping <b>the</b> perspiration from my face, for the day was hot, and the exertion and excitement left me exhausted.|$|R
5000|$|In August 1972, Gray and Smith had lunch. According to Smith, {{during this}} lunch Gray {{mentioned}} details of Donald Segretti and John Mitchell's {{involvement in the}} Watergate burglaries. Smith quotes Gray:"Gray {{told me about a}} guy who burned his palm, and about Donald Segretti (by name).And when he intimated over the entrée that the wrongdoing went further, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall on my inside banquette and looked at him in frank astonishment."The attorney general?" [...] I asked.He nodded.I paused."The president?" [...] I asked.He {{looked me in the eye}} without denial—or any comment. In other words, confirmation." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{balustrade}} all numb, {{watching them}} depart. I saw Cosimo come upon her {{other side and}} lean over her as he moved, so slim and graceful, beside her own slight, graceful figure. Then I sank to the cushions of the seat she had vacated, and stayed there with my misery until the night had closed about the place, and the white marble pillars looked ghostly and unreal.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{wall and}} cried. It {{was the first}} time in many years that I had cried. I {{remember}} noting, even in my extremity, the warmth of the tears on my cheeks and the salt taste when they reached my lips. Then I had a chill, and for a time shook as with an ague. Abandoning the openness of the yard as too impossible a feat for one in my condition, still shaking with the chill, crouching close to the protecting wall, my hands touching it, I started to skirt the yard.|$|E
60|$|I was so terror-stricken by {{this fight}} in the dark that <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> ladder, {{trembling}} and unable to ascend. And upon me was that old sickness at the pit of the stomach, caused always by the spectacle of physical violence. In this instance I could not see, but I could hear {{the impact of the}} blows—the soft crushing sound made by flesh striking forcibly against flesh. Then there was the crashing about of the entwined bodies, the laboured breathing, the short quick gasps of sudden pain.|$|E
40|$|I SAT IN T H E BARN WINDOW. It was Friday night - {{the first}} night I 2 ̆ 7 d been home for three months—{{the first night}} for three months that I 2 ̆ 7 d seen my brother, Rog, or helped him with the chores or sat in the barn window like this with my knees propped {{up in front of}} me. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> pitted side sill and looked up [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Governments in more {{developed}} economies partially compensate import-competing industries when world prices fall, <b>i.</b> e. they <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wind. In less developed economies we often observe liberalization {{in response to}} the same shock. We use a political-support maximization model with revenue motives to derive conditions under which a rational policy-maker would respond to lower world prices by reducing tariff protection for an import-competing industry. An initial tariff that exceeds the maximum revenue level proves necessary but not sufficient for politically optimal liberalization following a fall in the world price of the importable good...|$|R
60|$|How {{she came}} there I did {{not at the}} moment trouble to reflect. She was there. That was the hideous fact that made me doubt the sight of my own eyes, made me {{conceive}} almost that I was at my disordered visions again, the fruit of too much brooding. I felt {{as if all the}} blood were being exhausted from my heart, as if my limbs would refuse their office, and <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> for support <b>against</b> <b>the</b> terminal of the balustrade by which I stood.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> rail in {{the lee of}} the wheel-house, {{and stared}} up at the lofty spars and myriad ropes that I could guess were there. No, I decided I was not keen on the voyage. The whole {{atmosphere}} of it was wrong. There were the cold hours I had waited on the pier-ends. There was Miss West coming along. There was the crew of broken men and lunatics. I wondered if the wounded Greek in the 'midship house still gibbered, and if Mr. Pike had yet sewed him up; and I was quite sure I would not care to witness such a transaction in surgery.|$|E
6000|$|When Pilate {{came out}} again his words for Antipas' {{jurisdiction}} {{could not be}} heard, for all the mob was shouting that Pilate was a traitor, that if he let the fisherman go he was no friend of Tiberius. Close before me, as <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall, a mangy, bearded, long-haired fanatic sprang up and down unceasingly, and unceasingly chanted: [...] "Tiberius is emperor; there is no king! Tiberius is emperor; there is no king!" [...] I lost patience. The man's near noise was an offence. Lurching sidewise, as if by accident, I ground my foot on his to a terrible crushing. The fool seemed not to notice. He was too mad {{to be aware of}} the pain, and he continued to chant: [...] "Tiberius is emperor; there is no king!" ...|$|E
6000|$|I set him right. I {{told him}} that the vicar had married my mother's sister, and that the two had been father and mother to me since the death of my parents. He asked if he might venture to call on Doctor Starkweather the next day, {{mentioning}} the name of a friend of his, with whom he believed the vicar to be acquainted. I invited him to visit us, {{as if it had been}} my house; I was spell-bound under his eyes and under his voice. I had fancied, honestly fancied, myself to have been in love often and often before this time. Never in any other man's company had I felt as I now felt in the presence of this man. Night seemed to fall suddenly over the evening landscape when he left me. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> Vicarage gate. I could not breathe, I could not think; my heart fluttered as if it would fly out of my bosom--and all this for a stranger! I burned with shame; but oh, in spite of it all, I was so happy! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{gazed at}} me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features, which showed me that he knew me. He {{staggered}} back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth chattered in his head. At the sight, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my back <b>against</b> <b>the</b> door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was good}} advice, I thought, and I {{ran to the}} door, but as I came {{out into the open}} air my head swam round and <b>I</b> had to <b>lean</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> porch to save myself from falling. Consider all that I had been through, the anxiety of my escape, the long, useless flight in the storm, the day spent amid wet ferns, with only bread for food, the second journey by night, and now the {{injuries}} which I had received in attempting to deprive the little man of his clothes. Was it wonderful that even I should reach the limits of my endurance? ...|$|R
6000|$|I woke with {{stiff and}} cramped muscles from having slept {{long on the}} incommodious seat of a day coach. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my head <b>against</b> <b>the</b> seat and tried to think. After a long time I said to myself: [...] "I must have a name of some sort." [...] I searched my pockets. Not a card; not a letter; not a paper or {{monogram}} could I find. But I found in my coat pocket nearly $3,000 in bills of large denomination. [...] "I must be some one, of course," [...] I repeated to myself, and began again to consider.|$|R
6000|$|That I {{was alive}} and unscratched when I {{got as far as}} the tavern is a marvel. Amongst all the passion-lit faces which {{surrounded}} me I could get no sight of Nick's, and I managed to make my way to a momentarily quiet corner of the porch. As <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall there, trying to think what I should do, there came a great cheering from a little way up the street, and then I straightened in astonishment. Above the cheering came the sound of a drum beaten in marching time, and above that there burst upon the night what purported to be the [...] "Marseillaise," [...] taken up and bawled by a hundred drunken throats and without words. Those around me who were sufficiently nimble began to run towards the noise, and I ran after them. And there, marching {{down the middle of the}} street at the head of a ragged and most indecorous column of twos, in the centre of a circle of light cast by a pine-knot which Joe Handy held, was Mr. Nicholas Temple. His bearing, if a trifle unsteady, was proud, and--if I could believe my eyes--around his neck was slung the thing which I prized above all my possessions,--the drum which I had carried to Kaskaskia and Vincennes! He had taken it from the peg in my room.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wooden rail of the piazza, {{looking across}} the grounds. Within a dozen yards or so of us, several of Mrs. Van Reinberg's guests, with a {{collection}} of golf sticks, were clambering into a huge automobile. Beyond the pleasure gardens was a range of forest-covered hills, yellow and gold now with the glory of the changing foliage. In the valley was a small steeplechase course, towards which several people were riding. The horse which had been saddled for me was still being led about a little way down the avenue. With the exception that there was no shooting party, it was very much like the usual sort of gathering at an English country house. And yet it all seemed wholly unreal to me! I felt a strong inclination--perhaps a little hysterical--to burst out laughing. This was surely a gigantic joke, planned against the proverbial lack of humor of my countrymen! I was not expected to take it seriously! And yet, in a moment, I remembered certain established facts, of which these things were but the natural sequel. I remembered, too, a certain air of seriousness, and a disposition towards confidential talk, manifested among the older members of the party. Mrs. Van Reinberg's suppressed but earnest voice again broke the silence. She called me back to her side.|$|E
6000|$|... 7.30 P.M.--My {{deliberate}} {{opinion is}} that we are commanded by a madman. Nothing else can account for the extraordinary vagaries of Captain Craigie. It is fortunate that I have kept this journal of our voyage, as it will serve to justify us in case we have to put him under any sort of restraint, a step which I should only consent to as a last resource. Curiously enough it was he himself who suggested lunacy and not mere eccentricity as the secret of his strange conduct. He was standing upon the bridge about an hour ago, peering as usual through his glass, while I was walking up and down the quarterdeck. The majority of the men were below at their tea, for the watches have not been regularly kept of late. Tired of walking, <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bulwarks, and admired the mellow glow cast by the sinking sun upon the great ice fields which surround us. I was suddenly aroused from the reverie into which I had fallen by a hoarse voice at my elbow, and starting round I found that the Captain had descended and was standing by my side. He was staring out over the ice with an expression in which horror, surprise, and something approaching to joy were contending for the mastery. In spite of the cold, great drops of perspiration were coursing down his forehead, and he was evidently fearfully excited.|$|E
60|$|The lane debouched into a close-bitten field, {{and out of}} this empty {{land the}} farm rose up with its {{buildings}} like a huddle of old, painted vessels floating in still water. White fowls went stepping discreetly through the mild sunshine and the shadow. <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my bicycle <b>against</b> <b>the</b> grey, silken doors of the old coach-house. The place was breathing with silence. I hesitated to knock at the open door. Emily came. She was rich as always with her large beauty, and stately now with the stateliness of a strong woman six months gone with child.|$|R
2500|$|With this {{painting}}, Munch met his {{stated goal}} of [...] "the {{study of the}} soul, {{that is to say}} the study of my own self". Munch wrote of how the painting came to be: [...] "I was walking down the road with two friends when the sun set; suddenly, the sky turned as red as blood. <b>I</b> stopped and <b>leaned</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fence, feeling unspeakably tired. Tongues of fire and blood stretched over the bluish black fjord. My friends went on walking, while I lagged behind, shivering with fear. Then I heard the enormous, infinite scream of nature." [...] He later described the personal anguish behind the painting, [...] "for several years I was almost mad… You know my picture, 'The Scream?' I was stretched to the limit—nature was screaming in my blood… After that I gave up hope ever of being able to love again." ...|$|R
60|$|Then I went {{forth with}} a full heart. The night was very still, and none were {{stirring}} in the temple courts. I hurried through them, and reached {{the entrance to the}} pylon that is at the outer gate. Then, seeking solitude, and, as it were, to draw near to heaven, I climbed the pylon's two hundred steps, until at length I reached the massive roof. Here <b>I</b> <b>leaned</b> my breast <b>against</b> <b>the</b> parapet, and looked forth. As I looked, the red edge of the full moon floated up over the Arabian hills, and her rays fell upon the pylon where I stood and the temple walls beyond, lighting the visages of the carven Gods. Then the cold light struck the stretch of well-tilled lands, now whitening to the harvest, and as the heavenly lamp of Isis passed up to the sky, her rays crept slowly down to the valley, where Sihor, father of the land of Khem, rolls on toward the sea.|$|R
