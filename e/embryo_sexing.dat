There is also some {{evidence}} that females adjust their investment in offspring depending on the <b>sex</b> of the <b>embryo</b> during egg formation. Differential maternal investment to the eggs depending on their sex is usually interpreted as an adaptive strategy, by which females can increase competitive abilities of the smaller sex, or preferentially invest towards the sex with the potentially higher fitness returns. Here, we studied variation in egg size in relation to <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> and laying order in the European Blackbird. We found male and female eggs to differ in size, with larger eggs containing male embryos, as well as a significant interaction between <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> and laying order.

40|$|Abstract. In {{domestic}} animals {{of the family}} Bovidae, sex preselection of offspring has been demanded for convenience of milk/beef production and animal breeding. Development of the nonsurgical embryo transfer technique and sexing methods of preimplantation embryos made it possible. Sexing based on detection of Y chromosome-specific DNA sequences is considered the most reliable method to date. PCR enables amplification of a target sequence from {{a small number of}} blastomeres. However, it requires technical skill and is time consuming. Furthermore, PCR has the risk of false positives because of DNA contamination during handling of the PCR products in duplicate PCR procedures and/or electrophoresis. Therefore, for <b>embryo</b> <b>sexing</b> to become widely used in the cattle embryo transfer industry, a simple, rapid and precise sexing method needs to be developed. Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) is a novel DNA amplification method, and the reaction is carried out under isothermal conditions (range, 60 to 65 C) using DNA polymerase with strand displacement activity. When the target DNA is amplified by LAMP, a white precipitate derived from magnesium pyrophosphate (a by-product of the LAMP reaction) is observed. It is noteworthy that LAMP does not need special reagents or electrophoresis to detect the amplified DNA.

Buffalo oocytes collected from slaughtered animals were matured, fertilised and cultured in vitro for 7 days. On day 7 embryos were evaluated and divided in to six groups according to developmental stage (2, 4, 8, 16 cells, morulae and blastocyst). Each embryo was stored singly in phosphate-buffered saline at - 20 degreesC until PCR. Two different methods of extraction of DNA were compared: a standard procedure (ST), using a normal extraction by phenol-chloroform, isoamyl alcohol and final precipitation in absolute ethanol and a direct procedure (DT), using a commercial kit (Qiaquik-Qiagen mini blood). A pair of bovine satellite primers and two pairs of different bovine Y-chromosome-specific primers (BRY 4. a and BRY. 1) were used in the PCR assay on embryos and on whole blood samples collected from male and female adult buffaloes, used as control. The trial was carried out on 359 embryos (193 for ST and 166 for DT).

40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of primary offspring sex ratio adjustment is being extensively studied, yet {{knowledge of the}} underlying proximate mechanism is still mainly hypothetical. Female birds are the heterogametic sex, thus potentially controlling {{the sex of the}} gamete to be fertilized. In several bird species, independent studies showed effects of maternal plasma testosterone, corticosterone, or condition on primary offspring sex ratio. Our objective was to investigate the causal relation between these two maternal hormones, body condition, and offspring sex ratio in homing pigeons (Columba livia domestica). Following our earlier study, we again implanted females with testosterone and determined <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> of first eggs. To identify the pathway of sex ratio adjustment, we repeatedly measured not only maternal plasma testosterone and mass but also plasma corticosterone, cholesterol, and glucose, all indicators of body condition. We also calculated the temporal change in these parameters, which has been proposed to be a more accurate predictor of offspring sex ratio compared with the absolute values. Furthermore, we analyzed testosterone concentrations in outer yolk layers, which potentially influence the first meiotic division of the gamete. We found no relation between plasma parameter and <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> of first eggs; testosterone treatment did not affect any of the measured parameters. However, females that increased in mass produced more male embryos, irrespective of treatment group. Outer yolk layer testosterone concentrations did not differ between treatment groups or between male and female eggs.

Maternal androgens in the eggs of vertebrates may mediate such adaptive early maternal effects. However, the evolution of early maternal effects mediated by egg androgens may be constrained by the inability of mothers to differentially allocate androgens to eggs with a male or a female if androgens have different effects on sons and daughters. In this study, we increased the concentration of androgens in the eggs of barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) within the physiological range of variation and analyzed the effect on nestling growth and begging behavior. Egg androgens increased body size and mass of sons but reduced these characters in daughters when compared to two control groups in a repeated-measures analysis of variance of data collected at different ages. However, the differential effect of androgen on the two sexes was no longer significant when the analysis was restricted to the age of 12 days, when final body size is attained.

The effect of modified IVF media on post-fertilization embryo development, duration of sperm-oocyte co-incubation, and on blastocysts 2 ̆ 7 viability following vitrification was also investigated. Although in vitro production of mammalian embryos {{has led to the}} use of several culture media, combinations of culture media such as KSOM and SOF without co-culture have not been systematically tested previously. The rate of embryo development in KSOM or KSOM-SOF was investigated to determine if they affect blastocyst survival rate post-vitrification, and whether male and female embryos survive vitrification differently. This research has clearly demonstrated that IVF media affects post-fertilization embryo development and blastocyst survival post-vitrification.

First, assume {{what may be}} impossible, that the perfect animal can be defined or that {{only a limited number}} of definitions of “perfect” are needed. Then, can the “perfect” animal to match a definition be found? Suppose such an animal is found. Then the question to be answered before trying to clone as a method of genetic improvement becomes “Is the animal perfect because of phenotype or genotype?” In other words, the P = G + E problem exists, which requires traditional methods of genetic evaluation and testing to determine whether genotype (G) or random environmental (E) effects or a combination leads to the apparent perfection in the phenotype (P). For most traits, additive genetic variance accounts for 10 to 50 % of total variance, a fraction denoted as heritability. With a simple model, the best prediction of genotypic value is to reduce the apparent phenotypic superiority by multiplying by heritability. Cloning the “perfect” animal also could capture optimum dominance and epistatic genetic effects that are otherwise difficult to select for. For some traits, maternal effects are important. In that case, clones as breeding animals must be “perfect” for both direct and maternal genotypes, or alternatively terminal and maternal clone lines would need to be developed. The use of clones to increase uniformity can be only partially successful. If heritability is 25 %, then the standard deviation among clones would be 87 % of that of uncloned animals. Only if heritability is 100 % will clone mates have complete uniformity. Fixing the genotype could increase susceptibility to failure if environment changes or if the cloned genotype is susceptible to a new disease or if economic conditions change.

40|$|Introduction Secondary {{sex ratio}} (SSR) is the {{proportion}} of males to females at birth. It {{has been shown in}} many different mammalian species, many factors are associated with SSR. Changes in secondary sex ratio in dairy cows is considered economically important and the ability to change it could affect the revenues and profitability of a dairy farm. Thus, sperm or <b>embryo</b> <b>sexing</b> techniques in recent years has attracted more attention. Most breed of dairy cattle {{are more likely to have}} female calf is born to use them as replacement heifers and in order to maintain their productive herd number. On the contrary, when the goal is the production of meat, bull calves due to higher growth rates and production efficiency, are more convenient and more economically efficient. The aim of present study was to investigate some key factors affecting SSR in Iranian Holstein cows. According to Fisher, the sex ratio in the population under the control of natural selection is not always the same. There is overwhelming evidence to support the theory that shows Fisher Primary and secondary sex ratio sex ratio can deviate from this balance and natural selection caused a change in this ratio can be in certain circumstances. For example, the secondary sex ratio of 52 : 48 has been reported in dairy cows. Studies on mammalian species suggest that several factors, including latitude of the location, the dominant regional climate model, time and frequency of mating to ovulation, diet, age of parents, physical score, breed and produced eggs from ovarian left or right can have a significant effect on the secondary sex ratio. Weather conditions may modify the internal environment and the effect on physiological mechanisms or through the impact on the frequency and type of foods available to parents, the secondary sex ratio is impressive. The impact on the quantity and quality of parent's access to food sources in many species of mammals, the sex ratio has been fixed. Previous reports have shown that high environmental temperature and higher rates of evaporation from a week to a month before conception secondary sex ratio was increased.

This method was then improved by taking {{it a step further}} and combining it with a reverse transcription phase to allow for the detection of RNA. RT-LAMP is a one step nucleic acid amplification method that is used to diagnose infectious disease caused by bacteria or viruses. Although it has not been formally recognised by NAT, the method has been developed into many commercial kits {{that can be used for}} the identification of pathogens. The commonly used PCR method is able to generate millions of copies of the target strand. This process relies on thermal cycling, cycles of heating and cooling to facilitate the DNA replication. RT-LAMP does not require these cycles and is performed at a constant temperature between 60 and 65 °C. Similar to RT-PCR, RT-LAMP uses reverse transcriptase to synthesize complementary DNA (cDNA) from RNA sequences. This cDNA is then amplified using DNA polymerase, generating 10^9 copies per hour.|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluating of different methods applicable to the single cell DNA preparation for <b>embryos</b> <b>sex</b> determination in the early stages. In this study, we have introduced an efficient protocol for DNA extraction step in the single cell PCR method. We compared three different lysis methods including; one physical (nitrogen freezing and thaw) and two chemicals (potassium hydroxide/dithiothreitol; KOH/DTT lysis protocol) and (Nonidet P 40 /Proteinase K protocol) for utilizing in the single cell PCR procedure. The results of multiplex nested single cell PCR using NP 40 /PK protocol was eminently more repeatable and efficient for routine applications in the laboratory in compared with the other protocols analyzed in this study. Present results showed that the efficiency of amplification of the target genes in the single blastomer PCR was 94 % with NP 40 /PK protocol, 88 % for KOH/DTT lysis protocol and 64 % by using of freeze and thaw protocol. We concluded that the NP 40 /PK protocol was the most efficient method for extracting DNA from a single cell and could be particularly useful for <b>sexing</b> of bovine <b>embryos</b> in the early stages...|$|R
40|$|SummaryLoss of the kinase MAP 3 K 4 causes mouse {{embryonic}} gonadal sex reversal due {{to reduced}} expression of the testis-determining gene, Sry. However, because of widespread expression of MAP 3 K 4, the cellular {{basis of this}} misregulation was unclear. Here, we show that mice lacking Gadd 45 γ also exhibit XY gonadal sex reversal caused by disruption to Sry expression. Gadd 45 γ is expressed in a dynamic fashion in somatic cells of the developing gonads from 10. 5  days postcoitum (dpc) to 12. 5 dpc. Gadd 45 γ and Map 3 k 4 genetically interact during sex determination, and transgenic overexpression of Map 3 k 4 rescues gonadal defects in Gadd 45 γ-deficient <b>embryos.</b> <b>Sex</b> reversal in both mutants is associated with reduced phosphorylation of p 38 MAPK and GATA 4. In addition, embryos lacking both p 38 α and p 38 β also exhibit XY gonadal sex reversal. Taken together, our data suggest a requirement for GADD 45 γ in promoting MAP 3 K 4 -mediated activation of p 38 MAPK signaling in embryonic gonadal somatic cells for testis determination in the mouse...|$|R
40|$|Most {{systems for}} {{producing}} mammalian embryos in vitro use glucose as an energy source despite putative toxic effects. It {{is known that}} female embryos are more sensitive to negative effects of glucose during IVC. The aim of this work was to evaluate whether replacing glucose with myo-inositol and citrate during IVC affects sex ratio. Abattoir-derived oocytes were matured and fertilized in vitro using standard procedures. After 20 – 22 h of gametes co-incubation, zygotes were denuded and cultured in SOF containing either 1. 5 mM glucose or 2. 77 mM myo-inositol and 0. 34 mM citrate, for 7 days. The percentages of blastocysts were recorded and the embryos (on average 122 per group) were sexed by PCR as previously described (Alomar, 2008, Anim. Reprod. Sci. 107 48 - 61.). Differences in blastocyst rates and in the percentages of female embryos between groups were analyzed by Chi-Square test. The {{results of this study}} showed that myo-inositol-citrate increased both blastocyst yield (37. 4 vs 29. 5 %, respectively; P< 0. 01) and the percentage of female embryos compared to glucose (61. 5 vs 45. 6 % respectively; P< 0. 05). In conclusion, these results suggest to use myo-inositol and citrate in culture media to switch <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> ratio towards females...|$|R
40|$|This study {{provides}} the first {{detailed information on}} the reproductive biology of the smooth butterfly ray Gymnura micrura. A total of 905 individuals were sampled, 377 of which {{were used for the}} reproductive study. Juveniles accounted for 75 % of the sample, but all life cycle stages were present in the study area. The disc width at which 50 % were mature (WD 50) was estimated at 269 and 405 mm for males and females, respectively. The WD 50 V(based on the onset of vitellogenesis) was estimated at 359 mm. Uterine fecundity (mean +/- s. d. = 3. 8 +/- 1. 3; range: 16) was positively correlated with female size. A 3564 % gain in mean wet mass was observed from egg to full-term embryo in utero. Size at birth ranged from 135 to 175 mm WD (19. 5 to 55. 0 g), with a mean of 165. 1 mm WD (43. 3 g). The <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> ratio was not significantly different from 1 : 1. The ovaries of pregnant females were undergoing vitellogenesis during gestation, with females ready to ovulate soon after parturition. Gymnura micrura may have an asynchronous reproductive cycle, with females reproducing continuously throughout the year.

40|$|The {{invention}} of the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method a decade ago has given new impetus towards development of point of care diagnostic tests based on amplification of pathogen DNA, a technology {{that has been the}} precinct of well-developed laboratories. The LAMP technology amplifies DNA with high sensitivity relying on an enzyme with strand displacement activity under isothermal conditions. Additionally, the technology uses four to six specially designed primers recognising six to eight regions of the target DNA sequence, hence a high specificity. The auto-cycling reactions lead to accumulation of a large amount of the target DNA and other reaction by-products, such as magnesium pyrophosphate, that allow rapid detection using varied formats [1], [2]. Over the last 10 years, LAMP has been used widely in the laboratory setting to detect pathogens of medical and veterinary importance, plant parasitic diseases, genetically modified products, and tumour and <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> identification, among other uses [3]. However, its application under field conditions has been limited, partly due to the infancy of the technologies associated with LAMP, such as field-based template preparation methods and product detection formats. In this Viewpoint, the author highlights the essential technologies that require development before the LAMP platform can be progressed into a realistic point of care format for resource-poor endemic areas...|$|R
40|$|The {{use of an}} {{internal}} control in a multiplex-PCR assay for sex determination of In Vitro-produced bovine embryos was evaluated in biopsies of groups of 54 fresh and 44 frozen embryos. The internal controls used were the primers BOV 1 and BOV 2, which amplify a product with 626 base pairs (bp) of bovine mitochondrial DNA ND 5 gene. The primers BRY. 4 aF and BRY. 4 aR were used for bovine Y chromosome sequence amplification. The specificity of multiplex- PCR reactions realized in biopsies corresponding to about 20 % of each fresh embryo (10 male and 10 female) by means of confirming the sexing in the remaining embryo content (~ 80 %) presented 100 % specificity. Amplicons of the internal control and Y chromosome were both amplified until dilution corresponding to 6. 25 % of total extracted DNA from a male <b>embryo.</b> <b>Sex</b> determination was possible in 53 (98. 1 %) fresh embryos and 40 (90. 9 %) frozen embryos. The products related to the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA were simultaneously amplified in 34 (63 %) fresh embryos and 27 (61. 4 %) frozen embryos, showing a male <b>embryo.</b> The female <b>sex,</b> distinguished by internal control amplification only, was detected in 19 (35. 2 %) and 13 (29. 5 %) biopsies, respectively, of fresh and frozen embryos. In one (1. 8 %) and four (9. 1 %) biopsies of fresh and frozen embryos, respectively, neither product was amplified, most likely due {{to the absence of}} embryonic cells or the presence of embryonic cells going through apoptosis. The multiplex-PCR assay developed in this work showed avoided the limitation of a lack of {{an internal}} standard, and was also sensitive, specific, and efficient in reaction failure identification. This technique shows great potential for use on a commercial scale in routine sex determination of In Vitro-produced embryos...|$|R
40|$|IVF often {{requires}} embryo cryopreservation through vitrification. During the vitrification process, the embryos can be collapsed by withdrawing the blastocoele fluid. The metabolomic profile of blastocoele fluid has been recently investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry to provide metabolite {{information that can}} help estimations of implantation efficiency. However, the presence of embryo DNA in blastocoele fluid has not been reported to date. This study shows using real-time PCR that genomic DNA was present in about 90 % of blastocoele fluid samples harvested during the vitrification procedure. Moreover, the potential for determining <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> directly from blastocoele fluid is demonstrated by amplifying the multicopy genes TSPY 1 (on the Y chromosome) and TBC 1 D 3 (on chromosome 17). This opens up the possibility of screening embryos from couples carrying an X-linked disorder to identify male embryos {{at high risk of}} disease. The application of whole-genome amplification technologies to fluid samples is also shown to be feasible, potentially allowing more comprehensive genetic tests. As proof of principle, microarray comparative genomic hybridization was attempted to confirm the <b>sex</b> of <b>embryos</b> as well as detect several aneuploidies. However, further studies are needed to validate this approach and confirm that the accuracy is sufficient for diagnostic purposes. © 2013, Reproductive Healthcare Ltd. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This study {{analyzed}} broiler breeder age (29 or 60 wk-old) {{effects on}} physical characteristics of eggs (initial mass, mass loss, volume, diameter, surface area and density) and of eggshells(weight, volume, thickness, conductance, and porosity), {{as well as}} the influence of <b>embryo</b> <b>sex</b> on hematological parameters and body, liver and heart weights during incubation (at days 13, 15, 18 and 21). Physical parameter values were lower in 29 -wk-old broiler breeder eggs than those of 60 -wk-old breeders, except for relative eggshell weight, which was higher. In both male and female embryos, erythrocytic parameters and the body, liver, and heart weights increased during the incubation. The embryos and their organs were heavier when derived from 60 -wk-old breeder eggs as compared to 29 -wk-old breeder eggs. At hatching, hematocrit values were higher in males than in females. Thrombocytes were the most frequent leukocytes in the blood. Thrombocyte percentage decreased and lymphocyte percentage increased during the last days of incubation. The results showed maternal age influence only on body, heart and liver weights, focal sex-related influence the hematocrit at hatching, and temporal effect of incubation on body and organ weights, as well as on red blood cell count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, plasma glucose, and lymphocytes, which increased during the incubation period, while mean corpuscular volume and thrombocyte values decreased...|$|R
