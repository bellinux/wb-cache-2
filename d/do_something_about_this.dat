When Brave New World was {{released}}, Russell {{thought that}} Huxley's book {{was based on}} his book The Scientific Outlook, released the previous year. Russell contacted his own publisher and asked whether he should <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> [...] "apparent plagiarism". His publisher advised him not to, and Russell followed this advice.|$|E

According to Azerrad after exploring the punk era [...] "it skipped and went straight from Talking Heads to Nirvana. [...] "I thought, This is insane. Did I black out for 10 minutes?

I suggest to this Conference that we have coal mines with us... but they <b>did</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> problem: they closed them down. This was a complete reversal of the policy... that was promised by the Labour Government before it was put into office... this represents a betrayal of the mining industry.|$|R

In school he {{was not allowed to}} participate in plays unless he was dancer, in the Army as a soldier he was discriminated against, and as a supply clerk for the Veterans Administration he had many limits because of his skin color. He wanted to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> to end discrimination against African Americans.|$|E
50|$|Each year, World Toilet Day {{provides}} an opportunity {{to raise awareness of}} the importance of sanitation, and stimulate momentum towards reaching everyone, everywhere with equitable and improved sanitation.Sanitation is a global development priority. The Sustainable Development Goals, launched in 2015, include a target to ensure everyone everywhere has access to toilets by 2030.The objective of World Toilet Day is to raise awareness about all the people who {{do not have access to}} a toilet, and the urgent need to end the sanitation crisis. Another objective is to encourage people to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> sanitation crisis.|$|E
50|$|The need to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> {{discovery}} was the initiator of the ITD Movement. There were two goals: to drive change in state policy, and to facilitate {{positive change in}} {{the attitudes of the}} Indonesian people towards diversity in all its forms. The first step was taken. In March 2012, Denny JA published his collection of poetic essays entitled Atas Nama Cinta, or In the Name of Love. These were stories of discrimination in different guises, based on ethnicity, religion or religious understanding, gender and sexual oriententation.|$|E

5000|$|In 1936 Green [...] "{{thought of}} <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> He {{thought of a}} listing, as {{comprehensive}} as possible, of all first-class hotels throughout the United States that catered to Negroes." [...] He collected information on hotels, restaurants and gas stations that served African Americans for his first edition of The Negro Motorist Green Book. Since some towns {{did not have any}} hotels or motels that would accept African American guests, he listed [...] "tourist homes," [...] where owners would rent rooms to travelers. His first edition had data for facilities only in the New York metropolitan area. In his introduction, Green wrote:"There will be a day sometime in the near future when this guide will not have to be published. That is when we as a race will have equal rights and privileges in the United States." ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has become}} a truism in {{national}} public policy discourse that Indigenous affairs are a classic ‘wicked’ problem. The issues and interests in scope are without question all-encompassing and include every level of the Australian federation, social/economic/environmental policy, debates about rights, responsibilities and welfare conditionality, cultural diversity, historical injustices, and geographical disparities from urban to remote communities (see Head 2008). Serious Whitefella Stuff by Mark Moran confronts the conundrum and inevitable complexity of Indigenous policy and shines a very practical light on the mixed results in policy delivery and program implementation. Importantly, Moran proposes <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> unsatisfactory reality. Six case studies relating to remote communities in Queensland and the Northern Territory provide the narrative and evidence base for this book. The policy and delivery issues covered are diverse and complex including alcohol management, the outstations movement, rebuilding local community culture, home ownership and sustainable housing, and local impacts of a ‘shared responsibilities’ agenda...|$|R
5000|$|The {{early years}} of Joan van Hoorn's term of office were marked by the war then raging - the First Javanese War of Succession (1704 - 1708) [...] At first the Company wanted {{to stay out of}} the conflict, but {{eventually}} they had to take sides. In 1705, Joan van Hoorn concluded an agreement with Mataram, which ceded West Java to the Company. Joan van Hoorn experimented with coffee plantation. Prices were determined by the merchants at Mocha so to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> the Company tried growing coffee in other regions. Subsequently, there was great expansion of coffee growing, especially in the Priangan uplands near Batavia.|$|E

His grave was unmarked for almost thirty years, until Steve Salter (president of the Killer Blues Headstone Project) {{wrote a letter to}} Blues Revue magazine, saying, [...] "This piano great is lying in an unmarked grave. Let's <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> deplorable situation". Blues enthusiasts from around the world sent {{donations}} to purchase a headstone. On June 6, 1999, the marker was unveiled in a private ceremony. The stone is inscribed, [...] "Otis played the deepest blues we ever heard - He'll play forever in our hearts".|$|E

Writer Tony Grounds explained: [...] "When I was asked to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> age group I {{wanted to do something}} different. I didn't want to talk about pensions and bus passes." [...] Executive producer Jessica Pope said: [...] "The underlying theme that you're never too old to make changes in your life is universal. Jim and Ray take a course they couldn't contemplate in their youth, but they grasp the opposite now. They don't bow to others' expectations about how old men should behave." ...|$|E

The odds are that development will be about 70% from on-the-job experiences - working on tasks and problems; about 20% from feedback and working around good and bad examples of the need; and 10% from courses and reading.” ...|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} about a lower middle class boy Haider Ali (Sheraz) who {{is the son of}} a Pesh Imam (Nadeem Baig). He is in love with his {{neighborhood}} girl Sara (Kashaf Ali). Haider’s uncle (Irfan Khoosat) is a normal government officer who does not consider taking bribes to be a sin. Haider gets hooked by the local SHO (Shafqat Cheema) in a mob firing case. Ultimately after getting away with this case, Haider´s life takes a drastic change. Haider now sees the bigger and bitter picture of the current system, and how it affects everybody. He decides to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> system, and in the process, his education, family, friends and love are at stake.|$|E

That is totally absurd. Here's an umpire in the American League that knows nothing about the game of baseball. They have got to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> They have got some guys in this league that have no business umpiring. They have no business umpiring because they don't know what the game of baseball is about." ...|$|E
50|$|Clarity and Flinx reunite, but {{suddenly}} {{the ground beneath}} them erupts. Several of Flinx’s old friends, the Ulru-Ujurrians, emerge and ask for Flinx’s assistance in understanding a new threat that could end all life. They have discovered an alarm on Horseye that warns of impending danger, but all else is unknown. They project Flinx’s consciousness across space, and he finds something terrible and incomprehensible. He returns to his body and decides his mission {{in life is to}} <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> horrible threat. He promises the Ujurrians that he will learn more about the danger, and then they will meet again. He extends an invitation to Clarity to accompany him on his journey to understand himself and this new threat, but she declines, needing a break.|$|E

A great many schools within range of WSAZ-TV's signal had purchased TV equipment just to receive this program. A lot of people were very upset. Paul Blazer meant to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>This</b> was his home territory. These were the children of his company's families who were being trifled with.|$|R
5000|$|Poems such as “Etta Moten’s Attic” and “Africa, Drifting Through Me Sings” {{demonstrate}} Danner's growing {{passion for}} black African arts, cultures and {{peoples in the}} 1940s and 1950s. She looked to National Geographic magazines, anthropology books and American museums for information and images. Professing “the power of the African pull to be stronger than Western Civilization in my psyche,” Danner framed many of her poems around encounters with African art objects. She wrote in 1968, “I believe (and have tried {{for many years to}} <b>do</b> <b>something</b> positive <b>about</b> <b>this</b> conviction) that the Black should be awakened to his vast beauty.” ...|$|R

50|$|The Snake River wound through wheat-producing {{regions of}} eastern Washington. Farmers {{in these areas}} wanted to ship their {{products}} out as cheaply as possible, and looked to riverine transport {{as a way to}} do it. The problem was there were too many rapids and other obstructions to allow economic use of the river in its natural state. O.S.N. pressured the government to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> <b>this,</b> and so in 1867, the Corps of Engineers launched a two year survey of the upper Columbia and the Snake River, targeting rapids and other areas for work to improve navigability. During the next few years, rapids and obstructions at various points in both these rivers were removed or meliorated, largely at government expense.|$|E

50|$|The {{situational}} {{theory of}} publics, developed by Professor James E.

40|$|Research on {{real-world}} problems—like {{restoration of}} wetlands, {{the needs of}} the elderly, effective disaster response {{and the future of the}} airline industry—requires expert knowledge from a range of disciplines, as well as from stakeholders affected by the problem and those in a position to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>This</b> book charts new territory in taking a systematic approach to research integration using dialogue methods to bring together multiple perspectives. It links specific dialogue methods to particular research integration tasks. Fourteen dialogue methods for research integration are classified into two groups: 1. Dialogue methods for understanding a problem broadly: integrating judgements 2. Dialogue methods for understanding particular aspects of a problem: integrating visions, world views, interests and values. The methods are illustrated by case studies from four research areas: the environment, public health, security and technological innovation...|$|R

She sent secretly to Roland a proposition on this matter. Roland jumped at the opportunity: anything {{to be able to get}} out of jail. In fact, that is all he really wanted and would say and promise anything just to get out. Camiola then legally drew up all the necessary documents and arranged for his release. She had to pay two thousand ounces of silver for his release, which was half her wealth. She handed over the agreed amount to gain his release.|$|E

We could ban religious education in schools, but they will then pass it into their churches". On 31 January 1952 the Yugoslav authorities abolished religious education in state-run public schools, as part of the programme of separating church and state in Yugoslavia.

40|$|Overview: In {{partnership}} with the Sustainable Living Festival, Simran Sethi shares her wisdom on food, sustainability and climate change with the Wheeler Centre. The {{good news for the}} human among us (i. e. everyone) is that her approach is both passionate and imperfect. For example, she eats – and ‘loves’ – meat, despite her status as a high-profile environmental journalist and educator. She believes we’re trapped in a poisonous cycle of judgement, when we should be putting our energy into doing our individual best, whether that’s reflected in our supermarket shopping or the way we eat and cook at home. It’s not just up to the big corporations to create change, she says: we all contributed to the environmental catastrophe we face, and it’s on all of us to <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> it. <b>This</b> is a chance to get ideas on we can each do our part, in ways that are eminently manageable, to combat climate change and promote sustainability – in our everyday lives.  ...|$|R
