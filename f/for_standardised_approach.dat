40|$|Abstract Low-grade or minimal hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (MHE) is characterised by relatively mild neurocognitive impairments, and {{occurs in a}} substantial percentage of patients with liver disease. The presence of MHE {{is associated with a}} significant compromise of quality of life, is predictive of the onset of overt {{hepatic encephalopathy}} and is associated with a poorer prognosis for outcome. Early identification and treatment of MHE can improve quality of life and may prevent the onset of overt encephalopathy, but to date, there has been little agreement regarding the optimum method for detecting MHE. The International Society on Hepatic Encephalopathy and Nitrogen Metabolism convened a group of experts for the purpose of reviewing available data and making recommendations <b>for</b> a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> <b>for</b> neuropsychological assessment of patients with liver disease who are at risk of MHE.

40|$|Amongst {{the many}} {{identified}} mechanisms leading to diabetic foot ulceration, ill-fitting footwear is one. There is anecdotal evidence {{that people with}} diabetic peripheral neuropathy wear shoes that are too small {{in order to increase}} the sensation of fit. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether people with diabetic sensory neuropathy wear appropriate length footwear. Methods A case–control design was used to compare internal shoe length and foot length differences between a group of people with diabetes and peripheral sensory neuropathy and a group of people without diabetes and no peripheral sensory neuropathy. Shoe and foot length measurements were taken using a calibrated Internal Shoe Size Gauge® and a Brannock Device®, respectively. Results Data was collected from 85 participants with diabetes and 118 participants without diabetes. The mean difference between shoe and foot length was not significantly different between the two groups. However, a significant number of participants within both groups had a shoe to foot length difference that lay outside a previously suggested 10 to 15 mm range. From the diabetic and non-diabetic groups 82 % (70 / 85) and 66 % (78 / 118), respectively had a foot to shoe length difference outside this same range. Conclusions This study shows that although there is no significant difference in shoe-length fit between participants with and without neuropathy, a significant proportion of these populations wear shoes that are either too long or too short for their foot length according to the 10 to 15 mm value used for comparison. The study has highlighted the need <b>for</b> <b>standardised</b> <b>approaches</b> when considering the allowance required between foot and internal shoe length and for the measurement and comparison of foot and shoe dimensions...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{problems}} related to simulation model documentation and model exchange between users are discussed. Complex simulation models have gained popularity in the environmental field, but require extensive documentation to allow independent implementation. The existence of different simulation platforms puts high demands {{on the quality of}} the original documentation. Recent experiences from cross-platform implementations with the ASM 2 d and ADM 1 models reveal that error-free model documentation is difficult to obtain, and as a consequence, considerable time is spent on searching for documentation and implementation errors of various sources. As such, the list of errors and coding pitfalls provided for ASM 2 d and ADM 1 in this paper is vital information for any future implementation of both models. The time needed to obtain an error-free model implementation can be significantly reduced if a standard language for model documentation and exchange is adopted. The extensible markup language (XML) and languages based on this format may provide a remedy to the problem of platform independent model documentation and exchange. In this paper the possibility to apply this to environmental models is discussed, whereas the practical model implementation examples corroborate the necessity <b>for</b> a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Reporting {{adherence}} to intervention delivery and uptake is a detailed way of describing what was actually delivered and received, {{in comparison to}} what was intended. Measuring and reporting adherence is not routinely done well in complex interventions. The OK Diabetes trial (ISRCTN 41897033) aimed to develop and subsequently test the feasibility of implementing a supported self-management intervention in adults with a learning disability and type 2 diabetes. A key study objective {{was to develop a}} measure of {{adherence to}} the intervention. Methods We conducted a systematic review of published literature, extracting data from included papers using a standardised proforma. We undertook a narrative synthesis of papers to determine the form and content of methods for adherence measurement for self-management interventions in this population that had already been developed. We used the framework and data extraction form developed for the review as the basis for an adherence measurement tool that we applied in the OK Diabetes trial. Results The literature review found variability in the quality and content of adherence measurement and reporting, with no <b>standardised</b> <b>approach.</b> We were able to develop an adherence measure based upon the review, and populate it with data collected during the OK Diabetes trial. The adherence tool proved satisfactory for recording and measuring adherence in the trial.

40|$|Diet is {{well known}} to have {{beneficial}} health properties that extend beyond traditionally accepted nutritional effects. The approach involved in elucidating these beneficial physiological effects is becoming more important, as reflected by increasing research being undertaken. With growing consumer awareness of foods and food constituents {{and their relationship to}} health, the key questions for regulators, scientists and the food industry continue to relate to: (1) how consumers could be protected and have confidence that the health claims on foods are well supported by the evidence; (2) how research on physiological effects of food (constituents) and their health benefits could be stimulated and supported; (3) how research findings could be used in the development of innovative new food products.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus (HCV) -infected {{patients}} {{are at risk}} of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Individuals at heightened riskcould be targeted by intensive follow-up surveillance. We have conducted a systematic review of the literature to identify host genetic predisposition to HCC in HCV-infected patients. A comprehensive search of Medline and Embase databases was performed and the strength of evidence of associations for each gene on development of HCC was evaluated. We identified 166 relevant studies, relating to 137 different genes, or combinations thereof. 17 genes were classified as having “good” evidence of an association, a significant association was observed for 37 genes but this finding had not yet been replicated, 56 genes had mixed or limited evidence of an association, and 27 genes showed no association. IFNL 3 / 4, TNF-α and PNPLA 3 genes had the most evidence of an association. There was, however, considerable heterogeneity in study design and data quality. In conclusion, we identified a number of genes with evidence of association with HCC, but also a need <b>for</b> more <b>standardised</b> <b>approaches</b> to address this clinically critical question. It is important to consider the underlying mechanism of these relationships and which are confounded by the presence of other HCC risk factors and response to therapy. We also identified many genes where the evidence of association is contradictory or requires replication, {{as well as a number}} where associations have been studied but no evidence found. These findings should help to direct future studies on host genetic predisposition to HCC in patients with HCV infection...|$|R
40|$|Introduction:	Recent {{concerns}} over high failure rates in some metal-on-metal hip replacement bearings have highlighted the need <b>for</b> a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> to wear analysis of such components at retrieval. There {{is a need}} for a traceable metrological approach to the quantification and characterisation of in vivo wear as currently {{there are a number of}} approaches that have been adopted in literature and industry with a greater or lesser reference paid to good and reliable measurement practice. Method:	This paper shows the development of a comprehensive method for measuring the wear geometry of retrieved bearings. This is achieved using currently recognised co-ordinate metrology methods. Assessment and quantification of both the magnitude and effect of the three-dimensional measurement uncertainty on the measurement process as a whole is presented. The developed method is fully in accordance with established international standards. Results and Discussion:	Through initial measurements and simulated data, it has been shown that even for a CMM with a low maximum permissible error, the task-related volumetric uncertainty associated with measurement of spherical hip surfaces can be of the order of 1 - 2 mm 3. It is further shown in the data presented that uncontrolled measurement variables have a deleterious effect on the validity of the measurement result thus increasing the measurement uncertainty. With the precision required for accurate quantification of wear in new generation metal-on-metal bearing surfaces the magnitude of this uncertainty is significant. Conclusion:	An unambiguous statement of uncertainty is vital in measuring retrieved components as a means of comparison between studies and as a measure of confidence in measurement data. It is suggested that great care be taken when performing wear measurements on retrieved bearings...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} in tree rings {{could provide}} palaeoclimate reconstructions with perfect annual resolution and statistically defined confidence limits. Recent advances make the approach viable for non-specialist laboratories. The relevant literature is, however, spread across several disciplines, with common problems approached in different ways. Here we provide the first overview of isotope dendroclimatology, explaining the underlying theory and describing the steps taken in building and interpreting isotope chronologies. Stable carbon isotopes record {{the balance between}} stomatal conductance and photosynthetic rate, dominated at dry sites by relative humidity and soil water status and at moist sites by summer irradiance and temperature. Stable oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios record source water, which contains a temperature signal, and leaf transpiration, controlled dominantly by vapour pressure deficit. Variable exchange with xylem (source) water during wood synthesis determines the relative strength of the source water and leaf enrichment signals. Producing long Holocene chronologies will require a change in emphasis towards processing very large numbers of samples efficiently, whilst retaining analytical precision. A variety of sample preparation and data treatment protocols have been used, {{some of which have}} a deleterious effect on the palaeoclimate signal. These are reviewed and suggestions made <b>for</b> a more <b>standardised</b> <b>approach.</b> r 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1...|$|R
40|$|Nurses in {{the cardiac}} {{catheter}} procedure environment provide care for patients undergoing investigation and intervention for {{diagnosis and treatment}} of heart disease. It is evident that such patients undergoing cardiac catheterisation will experience heightened anxiety. Consequently, psychological assessment should be incorporated throughout all aspects of nursing care in this setting. Routine assessment is important to enable early identification of patient anxiety and inform management strategies to be applied to best support the patient. However, there is evidence from across cardiac patient populations that anxiety is not routinely asse ssed in the acute care setting. Moreover, evidence supports that nursing assessment of anxiety may be unreliable and does not always reflect the patient experienced anxiety. The objective {{of this study was to}} utilise a qualitative approach to study nursing practices in regards to anxiety assessment and management when caring for patients undergoing cardiac catheter procedures. The study was undertaken from a single site cardiac catheter procedure unit in a large tertiary hospital. Data was collected through document analysis, chart review and semi-structured individual interviews with five cardiac nurses. This study found that nursing assessment and management of patient anxiety for patients in this setting was not clearly defined or actively implemented. The research also identified that there were negative outcomes for both patients and nursing staff when patient anxiety was not identified or managed in a timely manner. Unique organisational and cultural factors were found to influence these aspects of care in this environment. Findings also identified the need <b>for</b> a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> to nursing assessment of anxiety and its subsequent management. Timely anxiety assessment and application of suitable nursing interventions to minimise patient anxiety are needed to yield positive outcomes for both patients and nursing staff. It is suggested that a suitable assessment tool to support standardised anxiety measurement be developed...|$|R
40|$|COST Action E 33 Forest for {{recreation}} and nature tourism (FORREC) is {{a network of}} researchers and practitioners {{working in the field}} from all around Europe. The work was devided into three working groups. The aim of Working Group 2 (WG 2) was to evaluate {{the state of the art}} of the present information basis {{for recreation}} in European countries. This report is an output of WG 2. The focus of WG 2 was on recreation monitoring, i. e. the information basis developed continuously and systematically to offer a national, regional or site-specific coverage of information, and information on changes over time. Recreation monitoring provides the information base for planning and management to achieve equal opportunities for close-to home outdoor recreation across Europe and among different social groups within individual countries. Information on recreational opportunities and capacity is essential for successful and sustainable nature tourism. Thus, the European Union needs comparable and consistent information on the recreational opportunities and on the demand for outdoor recreation and nature tourism within European countries. COST E 33 WG 2 recommends actions for developing better recreation information basis. These actions include recommendations for individual countries to produce recreation information which is comparable between regions and between countries, and which is consistent over time. Secondly, recreation information is needed to feed into indicators and standards for proactive planning for sustainable forestry, for allocation of resources and funding, and for successful management of forest resources in general. Thirdly, in order to achieve the goal of producing comparable recreation information across Europe, actions are needed to develop an advanced, harmonised methodology <b>for</b> a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach.</b> A <b>standardised</b> outdoor recreation monitoring programme at a European level is highly recommended...|$|R
40|$|The {{literature}} on vehicle crash reconstruction provides {{a number of}} empirical or classical theoretical models for the distance pedestrians are thrown in impacts with various types of vehicles and impact speeds. The aim {{of this research was}} to compare the predictions offered by computer simulation to those obtained using the empirical and classical theoretical models traditionally utilised in vehicle-pedestrian accident reconstruction. Particular attention was paid to the pedestrian throw distance versus vehicle impact speed relationship and the determination of pedestrian injury patterns and associated severity. It was discovered that computer simulation offered improved pedestrian kinematic prediction in comparison to traditional vehicle-pedestrian accident reconstruction techniques. The superior kinematic prediction was found to result in a more reliable pedestrian throw distance versus vehicle impact speed relationship, particularly in regard to varying vehicle and pedestrian parameters such as shape, size and orientation. The pedestrian injury prediction capability of computer simulation was found to be very good for head and lower extremity injury determination. Such injury prediction capabilities were noted to be useful in providing additional correlation of vehicle impact speed predictions, whether these predictions were made using computer simulation, traditional vehicle-pedestrian accident reconstruction methods or a combination of both. A generalised approach to the use of computer simulation for the reconstruction of vehicle-pedestrian accidents was also offered. It is hoped that this approach is developed and improved by other researchers so that over time guidelines <b>for</b> a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> to the simulation of vehicle-pedestrian accidents might evolve. Thoracic injury prediction, particularly for frontal impacts, was found to be less than ideal. It is suspected that the relatively poor thoracic biofidelity stems from the development of pedestrian mathematical models from occupant mathematical models, which were in turn developed from cadaver and dummy tests. It is hoped that future research will result in improved thoracic biofidelity in human mathematical models...|$|R

40|$|Phenotyping {{requires}} measuring traits {{chosen for}} their socio-economic importance or their cognitive value. Needs for phenotyping {{depend on the}} trend in breeding methods and production systems, and also on technological developments allowing <b>for</b> high throughput <b>standardised</b> <b>approaches</b> at a reasonable cost. Considering animal breeding, implementation of genomic selection introduces the concept of reference population, where specific phenotypes not routinely available can be obtained to associate genetic markers with performance. Association between markers and phenotypes also open the way towards individual diagnostic to support herd management. Robotics and individual electronic identification require important investments but offer quite new prospects for phenotyping traits such as feed efficiency or behaviour. Complementary tools are provided by technological developments in functional genomics and by spectral analysis of proteins, which can unravel underlying mechanisms and refine the definition of phenotypes at the molecular scale. The concept of biomarker has emerged in human medicine in order to predict phenotype {{and is expected to}} be applied also to farm animals. The closer the phenotyping is from the biological mode of action, the more accurate will be the detection of genes determining phenotypic variation. More particularly, the search for genome regions controlling gene expression (eQTL) makes possible to explore the mechanisms responsible for the variability of complex traits. Great progress can thus be expected for the identification of genes underlying QTL thanks to simultaneous improvements in phenotyping and genome sequencing. ...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{characteristics of}} consultations {{that do not}} conform to the traditionally understood communication 'dyad', in order to highlight implications for medical education and develop a reflective 'toolkit' for use by medical practitioners and educators in the analysis of consultations. DESIGN: A series of interdisciplinary research workshops spanning 12  months explored the social impact of globalisation and computerisation on the clinical consultation, focusing specifically on contemporary challenges to the clinician-patient dyad. Researchers presented detailed case studies of consultations, taken from their recent research projects. Drawing on concepts from applied sociolinguistics, further analysis of selected case studies prompted the identification of key emergent themes. SETTING: University departments in the UK and Switzerland. PARTICIPANTS: Six researchers with backgrounds in medicine, applied linguistics, sociolinguistics and medical education. One workshop was also attended by PhD students conducting research on healthcare interactions. RESULTS: The contemporary consultation is characterised by a multiplicity of voices. Incorporation of additional voices in the consultation creates new forms of order (and disorder) in the interaction. The roles 'clinician' and 'patient' are blurred as they become increasingly distributed between different participants. These new consultation arrangements make new demands on clinicians, which lie beyond the scope of most educational programmes for clinical communication. CONCLUSIONS: The consultation is changing. Traditional consultation models that assume a 'dyadic' consultation do not adequately incorporate the realities of many contemporary consultations. A paradox emerges between the need to manage consultations in a 'super-diverse' multilingual society, while also attending to increasing requirements <b>for</b> <b>standardised</b> protocol-driven <b>approaches</b> to care prompted by computer use. The tension between standardisation and flexibility requires addressing in educational contexts. Drawing on concepts from applied sociolinguistics and the findings of these research observations, the authors offer a reflective 'toolkit' of questions to ask of the consultation in the context of enquiry-based learning...|$|R

40|$|Troponins are {{regulatory}} {{proteins and}} part of the contractile apparatus that is integral to muscle contraction in skeletal and cardiac muscle but not smooth muscle and are important clinically because cardiac troponins (cTn) are sensitive indicators of myocyte injury and have become integral to the definition of myocardial infarction. There are several issues surrounding the significance of troponin and how it should be used, both for the assessment of cardiac disease and in settings of non-cardiac illness. This thesis examines a number of these areas of uncertainty. This thesis focuses initially on the analytical validation of troponin assays and I offer guidelines <b>for</b> a <b>standardised</b> <b>approach</b> to undertaking the verification of these analytical characteristics. I report on these characteristics for 2 highly sensitive assays and their application to a cardio-healthy population. In the second part of this thesis I focus on the physiology of troponin in the normal population. I describe studies undertaken with a cohort of healthy children and demonstrate the significance of population coning when determining the 99 th percentile of the upper reference limit using 2 highly sensitive troponin assays. The final part of this thesis investigates the significance of troponin in the acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and non ACS setting. I offer a hypothesis suggesting that bleb formation is a mechanism for troponin release. I describe how improvements in sensitivity of troponin T assays allow better prognostic information regarding all cause mortality in end stage renal disease patients, demonstrate troponin release after strenuous exercise in elite cyclists and I describe a cross-sectional study looking at troponin concentrations in subjects with non cardiac illness and the general community. Using data mining techniques I demonstrate how the use of a new high sensitivity troponin I assay can offer greater assistance to the clinician in stratifying patients at risk of a major adverse cardiac event (MACE). I provide evidence that suggests the use of a multi-marker approach to identifying patients at risk is potentially viable...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{practices}} of those individuals acting as foreign credential evaluators {{with a focus on}} postgraduate access at Irish higher education institutions (HEIs). Using a research design that involves a refined form of Grounded Theory (Glaser and Strauss 1967; Charmaz 2000, 2006; Glaser 2001), the researcher explores what constitutes and influences practice in differing local contexts for credential evaluators. A preliminary research phase aided the development of four research questions which facilitated the conducting of 14 semi-structured interviews and two focus group interviews with credential evaluators. Each of the four research questions concern a key aspect of the work of credential evaluators. - Role: What do credential evaluators feel their role entails, and what are their priorities when evaluating foreign qualifications? - Values: What values are important to credential evaluators in evaluating foreign qualifications? - Processes: What resources, tools and procedures are used in carrying out credential evaluation? - Policy: What policies impact on the work of a credential evaluator and how? These specific questions do not exhaust the broader aims of the research. These are concerned with advancing understanding of credential evaluation practice at HEIs, thereby offering a reliable means of improving practice, based on an analysis of best available information and knowledge. Based on the researcher’s interpretation of the data, five key issues impacting on credential evaluation practice emerged from the interviews. I. Discrepancies in approach to credential evaluation in higher education institutions II. Benefits and difficulties in using UK NARIC as an authority in credential evaluation III. Differing levels of professional support for credential evaluation within and across higher education institutions IV. Understanding credential evaluation practice through connections with existing policies and activities V. Tensions between the needs of the individual applicant, the credential evaluator and the higher education institution The issues highlighted above are interdependent with the matter of professional identity offered by the researcher as the main connecting thread. Firstly, there is as yet no designated role of evaluator of foreign credentials in Irish HEIs, leading to a lack of clarity. Secondly, extensive use of UK NARIC services, although helpful in some key respects, can also exacerbate confusions where the role of Irish HEIs as competent recognition authorities is concerned. The duration and depth of experience of a credential evaluator have a strong impact on his/her capability, especially when seeking and accessing appropriate assistance for credential evaluation activities. This experience factor is all the more important currently, as the context for foreign credential evaluation is changing rapidly. The global demand for higher education has increased exponentially, resulting in increased mobility of potential students {{and the development of a}} plethora of credential evaluation tools. This dynamic has led to greater demands on HEIs for transparency, fairness and accountability in how foreign qualifications are recognised. Finally, while the Lisbon Recognition Convention provides a legal and ethical framework to guide practice, the research undertaken for this thesis suggests that decision-making is highly individualised. It frequently relies on tacit knowledge, experience and informal networks and is impacted on by the prevailing organisational culture. There is a tension between the push <b>for</b> <b>standardised</b> <b>approaches</b> to practice on the one hand and the pressures of internationalisation, and the autonomy of academics and institutions on the other. In summary, credential evaluation at Irish HEIs is shown to be an emergent, rather than established practice. Based on analysis of the findings, the thesis explores the merits of promoting community of practice approaches (Wenger 1998) to address fruitfully the main issues of concern investigated during the research. The study concludes by offering a number of recommendations for attention and action by credential evaluators and management staff at HEIs in particular. A number of reflections by the researcher are also offered...|$|R
