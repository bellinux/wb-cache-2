5000|$|A color {{scroller}} {{or color}} changer is an electro-mechanical lighting accessory used in theater, film, dance and concerts {{to change the}} color projected by stage lighting instruments without the need of a person {{to be in the}} vicinity of the light. A color scroller moves plastic [...] "gel" [...] color <b>gel</b> <b>dyed</b> polyester and/or other base materials coated with dyes into the beam of the light. It is generally attached to the gel frame holder at the transmitting end of a lighting fixture, so color is introduced after the beam characteristics have been defined by the optics of the lighting instrument. Most scrollers are controlled via DMX512 protocol, but some models (e.g. Wybron's Coloram IT) also utilize the RDM protocol. When color scrollers were first introduced around 1980, a number of companies produced them, including: Avolites, GAM Products, Morpheus Lights, Rainbow, Rosco Laboratories and Wybron Inc.

50|$|The method {{works by}} pairing the {{targeted}} genetic sequence with custom designed complementary bits of DNA called primers. In {{the presence of}} the target sequence, the primers match with it and trigger a chain reaction. DNA replication enzymes use the primers as docking points and start doubling the target sequences. The process is repeated over and over again by sequential heating and cooling until doubling and redoubling has multiplied the target sequence several million-fold. The millions of identical fragments are then purified in a slab of <b>gel,</b> <b>dyed,</b> and can be seen with UV light. It is not prone to contamination. Irrespective of the variety of methods used for DNA analysis, only PCR in its different formats has been widely applied in GMO detection/analysis and generally accepted for regulatory compliance purposes. Detection methods based on DNA rely on the complementarity of two strands of DNA double helix that hybridize in a sequence-specific manner. The DNA of GMO consists of several elements that govern its functioning. The elements are promoter sequence, structural gene and stop sequence for the gene.|$|R

40|$|Following hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCF), {{it is important to}} determine whether engraftment is successful and to track the dynamic changes of the graft. Tandem repeats such as minisatellites and microsatellites are currently the most established markers for chimerism application. We have developed a reliable method to quantitatively evaluate engraftment status in post-allogeneic HSCT patients using variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers and ``lab-on-a-chip'' microfluidic electrophoresis technology. Following identification of an informative marker by conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), donor chimerism percentage was calculated based on a standard curve generated from artificially mixed patient-donor DNA-specific alleles in serial dilutions. All PCR products were mixed with commercial <b>gel</b> <b>dye</b> and loaded into Agilent DNA 1000 microfluidic LabChips for DNA sizing and quantitation. In 44 patients, separation of pretransplant and donor DNA fragments was resolved clearly and accomplished rapidly within 30 min. Chimerism analysis using this platform is able to detect an amount as low as 6. 3 % donor DNA with acceptable coefficient of variation values. We also demonstrated concordant chimerism, analysis findings using both microchip tandem repeats and real-time PCR quantitation of insertion-deletion polymorphisms. This microchip platform obviates the need for fluorescently labeled primers or any post-PCR sample manipulation. Quantitative monitoring of post-HSCT chimerism status using microfluidic electrophoresis is a useful tool for both large- and small-scale post-HSCT chimerism centers. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: A cadaver {{study in}} {{preparation}} of a facial allograft transplantation in humans requires accurate dissection of the arterial, venous and nerve pedicles.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight fresh cadavers aged 55 - 89 years at the time of death were studied. Five were female and three were male. All injections were performed within four post-mortem days. RESULTS: Our method determined the perfusion territories of the human face without risk of spillage of the dye from capillary structures and showed the arteries very clearly. Vascular patterns of the face were interpreted after <b>dyed</b> <b>gel</b> mixture injection.

Moreover, as shown in Additional file  1 : Table S 5, Bn-Am could gel organic solvents which have smaller densities than water (e.g., toluene, o-xylene, 1, 3, 5 -trimethylbenzene and ethylbenzene) and Gn-Am showed strong gelation properties towards organic solvents which are heavier than water (e.g., nitrobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane). Additionally, Gn-Am showed strong abilities to selectively gel nitrobenzene/o-dichlorobenzene from the mixture with wastewater (containing 0.5 [*]M sodium nitrate and 0.5 [*]M sodium sulfate) without employing co-solvents and a heating-cooling process.

40|$|The {{gelation}} {{efficiency of}} {{low molecular weight}} bolaamphiphilic hydrogelators 1 and 2 {{is influenced by the}} presence of SDS micelles. Similarly, the critical micellar concentration value of SDS is reduced {{in the presence of the}} studied molecular hydrogelators. Rheological measurements indicate that the strength of the hydrogels can be modulated with SDS, the gels becoming weaker in the presence of micelles This behavior has been rationalized with the help of NMR studies using diffusion measurements and NOE correlations. The results obtained clearly point to the formation of mixed micelles composed of SDS and the hydrogelators. In the case of 1, the gelator:SDS ratio in the mixed micelles has been estimated from solubility studies to be ca. 1 : 2. 5. Electron microscopy reveals that when SDS is present, the morphology of the xerogels is modified in its appearance at the micrometer scale but fibers with diameter in the nanometer range are observe in all the cases. The interplay between the surfactant and the gelators provides with new possibilities for the modulation of both gel and micelle formation.
