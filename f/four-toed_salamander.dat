50|$|<b>Four-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> feed {{mostly on}} small invertebrates, such as spider, worms, ticks, springtails (collembola), ground beetles (Carabidae) and other insects. Larvaes love small aquatic crustaceans.|$|R
50|$|Mating {{occurs in}} {{terrestrial}} areas throughout the fall months. In early spring the females nest on land, {{along the banks}} of small ponds. After the 4-6 week embryonic period, the larvae hatch and {{make their way to the}} adjacent pond. <b>Four-toed</b> <b>Salamanders</b> undergo a relatively short aquatic larval period, when compared to other species of the same family, ranging between 3 and 6 weeks.|$|R
40|$|<b>Four-toed</b> <b>salamanders</b> in Arkansas {{represent}} a disjunct population {{separated from their}} main range in the eastern United States and Canada. Until recently, the distribution of this species was documented by a few individual specimens collected or observed from widely spaced localities which has resulted in its being considered rare and vulnerable. Recent investigations of distribution and habitat utilization indicate this species may be more common than previously believed, but also reaffirms {{the need to protect}} riparian habitat, springs, ponds, woodland seeps and other preferred, moist habitats containing mossy areas used as primary egg deposition sites...|$|R
50|$|In Canada, the <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> can {{be found}} in {{southern}} Ontario and Quebec, in Nova Scotia and a single population was found in New Brunswick in 1983. In the United States, it {{can be found}} from Maine to Wisconsin and as far as Alabama in the south.|$|E
50|$|The dwarf {{salamander}} (Eurycea quadridigitata) is {{a species}} of salamander native to the southern United States, from North Carolina to Oklahoma, south to Texas along the Gulf of Mexico states to northern Florida.

5000|$|The <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> can be {{recognized}} by its white underbelly sprinkled with black dots. Its back varies from orange-brownish to red-brownish; its flanks are grayish. The body and the limbs are elongated. The snout is short, and the eyes are prominent. The tail color is usually brighter than the back, and you can observe a constriction at the body/tail junction. The posterior limbs have four toes (hence its name), a good identification criterion but hard {{to use in the}} field. This species rarely exceeds 10 cm in length. The sexes are alike except for the shape of the head. Males have elongated and almost square snouts, whereas the females' snouts are short and round. The juveniles show a tail shorter than the body.The <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> can be easily mistaken for the redback salamander (Plethodon cinereus) in the wild. The redback’s underbelly is more of a [...] "salt & pepper" [...] color. There is no constriction at the tail and posterior limbs show five digits.|$|E
50|$|This species favored {{habitats}} are sphagnum bogs, grassy areas surrounding beaver {{ponds and}} deciduous or mixed forests rich with mosses. The <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> {{will use the}} sphagnum bogs during reproduction, but uses the forest habitat during the summer. It overwinters in terrestrial habitat, using old burrows or cavities created by rotting roots, below the freezing depth. It will frequently overwinter in groups, sometimes with other amphibians such as the Redback Salamander.|$|E

50|$|The <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> {{has three}} main forms of self-defense against predators. The {{first is that}} it {{purposely}} sheds off its tail to distract the enemy. When the tail comes of, it is still wiggling around. The enemy gets distracted giving the salamander time to get away. The second form of defense is playing dead. When threatened, this salamander will have a short burst of violent trashes and then stop dead in its tracks. It will stay frozen like this until it feels the threat is gone (Sass and Anderson, 2011). The third and final form of defense is it will curl up and put its tail on its back offering it in exchange for its life.|$|E
50|$|The Woodbourne Forest and Wildlife Preserve is a {{protected}} area managed by The Nature Conservancy covering 648 acre in northeastern Pennsylvania. The preserve contains old fields, meadows, creeks, bogs, and forests that {{are home to}} a wide variety of animals. These include over 180 species of birds such as pileated woodpeckers, great horned owls, and winter wrens. The preserve's wetlands harbor frogs, snakes, and nine species of salamander, including the spring salamander, northern two-lined salamander, and <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander.</b> The preserve's forests, part of the Allegheny Highlands forests ecoregion, contain 120 acre of old growth northern hardwood forest that includes eastern hemlock, sweet birch, sugar maple, northern red oak, white ash, and American beech. Visitor activities include hiking, snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, birdwatching, and photography.|$|E
5000|$|In its 1981 {{environmental}} impact report on a flood control project, Army Corps of Engineers discussed the unique natural spring environment in the Reservation, providing habitat for six species of salamander: [...] "Scattered along the northwest slopes above Blue Brook in the Watchung Reservation, from the [...] "Glen" [...] to Seeley's Pond, are numerous springs that are of apparent great antiquity.The springs in the Reservation are the only series of intact and relatively undisturbed springs remaining in the area, others having been destroyed, disturbed or altered in some way by human activities.Most springs will have one to three species of salamanders (Dusky, Two-lined, Red) that carry out their entire life cycles {{in the vicinity of}} the spring. The addition of any others indicates very long periods of stability. The <b>Four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> is a rare relictual species, the presence of which makes these springs unique. The Long-tailed salamander is an even greater indicator of long term stability since it utilizes the underground portions of the springs as well as the surface portions. It also adds uniqueness to these springs since the Reservation is the only place outside the Kittatinny Ridge and Valley of Sussex County where populations are known to occur at present.No other system of springs in New Jersey appears to contain all five of the salamander species found in the Reservation.There have also been reports of sightings of the Blue-spotted salamander in the springs of Watchung Reservation." ...|$|E
50|$|Rising 150-200 feet (45-60 m) {{above the}} low terrace of Green Bay, the steep {{carbonate}} cliffs and outcrops support numerous rare land snails including the cherrystone drop snail (Hendersonia occulta), a state-threatened species. Aspen, sugar maple, red oak, hemlock, and white cedar {{grow out of}} the talus affording complete shade to the escarpment maintaining the cool and damp conditions, which support a lush growth of mosses. The unique site conditions also support such uncommon species as climbing fumitory, mountain maple, bulbet fern, common polypody, and fragile fern. Above the escarpment is a dry-mesic forest of red and white pine with red oak. The ground layer is dominated by round-leaved dogwood with northern bush honeysuckle, zig-zag goldenrod, big-leaved aster, and bracken fern. The site slowly grades into a richer, more mesic forest containing sugar maple, beech, and red oak with hemlock, and white pine. Also present is a wet-mesic forest of white cedar, big-tooth aspen, and black ash. Several white cedars reach impressive sizes here. Below the escarpment are seasonally flooded forests dominated by silver maple, and green ash with swamp white oak, American bladdernut, and great water-leaf. The site contains many rare plants including dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris). Other noteworthy species within the SNA are variegated horsetail (Equisetum variegatum), Hooker's orchid (Platanthera hookeri), long-spurred violet (Viola rostrata), and large-flowered ground-cherry (Leucophysalis grandiflora). Rare animals include red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), Midwest Pleistocene vertigo (Vertigo hubrichti), Iowa Pleistocene vertigo (V. iowaensis) and <b>Four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> (Hemidactylium scutatum). Significant portions of the Bayshore Blufflands are owned by the Door County Land Trust.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{movement}} phenology of the <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> (Hemidactylium scutatum) {{is essential to}} guide management practices. I {{examined the relationship between}} environmental variables and the directionality, timing, and magnitude of <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> movements at two locations in eastern Massachusetts. Four-toed salamanders move from upland habitats to wetland areas in early spring and move away from wetlands in late spring. Adult movements increased with more precipitation and less moon light. Juvenile movements were similarly affected, and in addition {{they were more likely to}} move when temperatures were warm and days long. My results can be used to implement management strategies aimed at reducing human-related impacts on migrating four-toed salamanders (e. g., road closures to reduce road mortality). In addition, I developed and evaluated the accuracy of classification and regression tree (CART) models at multiple spatial scales to predict suitable habitat and potential species occurrences of the <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> (Hemidactylium scutatum) in Massachusetts. I analyzed <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> Element Occurrence (EO) observations reported during 1990 - 2009 in response to fifteen environmental predictor variables at six different local and landscape-scales. The landscape-scale model measured at 2000 m was most successful at predicting <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> habitat. It correctly classified 92. 4 % of the training data and 87. 7 % of the verification data. When the 2000 m model was applied statewide, 30, 195 wetlands were determined to be potentially suitable habitat for the <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander.</b> The results of this study confirm the potential and value of classification and regression tree models for identifying potential habitat for rare or cryptic species...|$|E
40|$|Conserving {{amphibian}} populations requires {{knowledge of}} a species and its habitat relationships. The <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> (Hemidactylium scutatum) is listed as Special Concern in Maine and 11 additional states and provinces, Threatened in Illinois, and Endangered in Indiana (Appendix A). Little is known of H. scutatum ecology despite the species ' extensive range. Infrequent sightings of H. scutatum throughout its range may indicate either low numbers or that the species ' behavior make detection difficult. Records for H, scutatum in Maine existed from only 32 sites before my study, and {{the total number of}} occurrences of this species in Maine is unknown (P. deMaynadier, Maine Department of Inland Fisheries and Wildlife, personal communication). I found 238 <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> nests in 36 wetlands, which were new sites. The survey protocol, natural history descriptions, and definitions of wetland and shoreline habitat presented will increase detections of this species and thus improve the monitoring and management of H, scutatum and the wetland habitat that this species occupies. In the first chapter, I compare monitoring techniques for the species, document new points in which I found the species, and present natural history information. ...|$|E
40|$|The Author(s) 2015. Published by Oxford University Press, {{on behalf}} of the Society of Systematic Biologists. All rights reserved. Deep phylogenetic {{relationships}} of the largest salamander family Plethodontidae have been difficult to resolve, probably reflecting a rapid diversification early in their evolutionary history. Here, data from 50 independent nuclear markers (total 48, 582 bp) are used to reconstruct the phylogeny and divergence times for plethodontid salamanders, using both concatenation and coalescence-based species tree analyses. Our results robustly resolve the position of the enigmatic eastern North American <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> (Hemidactylium) as the sister taxon of Batrachoseps + Tribe Bolitoglossini, thus settling a long-standing question. Furthermore, we statistically reject sister taxon status of Karsenia and Hydromantes, the only plethodontids to occur outside the Americas, leading us to new biogeographic hypotheses. Contrary to previous long-standing arguments that plethodontid salamanders are an old lineage originating in the Cretaceous (more than 90 Ma), our analyses lead to the hypothesis that these salamanders are much younger, arising close to the K-T boundary (~ 66 Ma). These time estimates are highly stable using alternative calibration schemes and dating methods. Our data simulation highlights the potential risk of making strong arguments about phylogenetic timing based on inferences from a handful of nuclear genes, a common practice. Based on the newly obtained timetree and ancestral area reconstruction results, we argue that (i) the classic "Out of Appalachia" hypothesis of plethodontid origins is problematic; (ii) the common ancestor of extant plethodontids may have originated in northwestern North America in the early Paleocene; (iii) origins of Eurasian plethodontids likely result from two separate dispersal events from western North America via Beringia in the late Eocene (~ 42 Ma) and the early Miocene (~ 23 Ma), respectively...|$|E
40|$|Pleistocene {{glaciation}} of New England excluded both terrestrial {{and aquatic}} herpetofauna {{from the region}} until the retreat of the ice began approximately 22, 500 years ago. Three general dispersal routes appear to dominate the post-Pleistocene re-colonization of New England by reptiles and amphibians. (1) As the ice sheet receded beyond the St. Lawrence River, immigration from refugia in the Mississippi Valley was facilitated by the newly formed Prairie Peninsula corridor which channeled organisms north and east into New York and the Champlain Basin. (2) The Coastal Lowlands Corridor, connecting the southern coastal regions and the southern Appalachian refugia with coastal New England. (3) Exposed regions of Coastal Plain {{off the coast of}} New England allowed regional re-colonization. ^ The mudpuppy (Necturus maculosus) a wholly aquatic, perennibranchiate salamander, is the largest salamander found in New England (20 – 33 cm TL). Annual samples of Necturus were collected from 1990 – 1998, during the draw-down of a canal adjacent to the Connecticut River. Snout vent lengths were taken and animals were allotted to year class based on length. Skeletochronology confirmed the age/length correlation. The location of a subset of animals was marked and the depth at which they were found was calculated. The age of the animals was correlated with bottom structure and depth. ^ The <b>four-toed</b> <b>salamander</b> (Hemidactylium scutatum), is the smallest and rarest of New England 2 ̆ 7 s salamanders. As adults, four-toed salamanders are terrestrial. Observations show that female four-toed salamanders migrate in early spring into wetland breeding sites where they nest colonially. Embryonic development is temperature dependent with hatching occurring in late spring. The pond-type larvae wriggle from the nest chamber into the water where, after six or seven weeks, they metamorphose into small terrestrial juveniles. ^ Massachusetts populations of the eastern spadefoot (Scaphiopus holbrookii) are at the extreme northern limits of the species 2 ̆ 7 range. Breeding sites and upland habitat are frequently destroyed by development. A survey of historic sightings and major museum collections shows the historical distribution of spadefoots. New collections and records were made of existing populations in Massachusetts. The habitat and other ecological requirements to maintain a viable population are characterized. ...|$|E
