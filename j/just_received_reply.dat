Lee Chan reveals {{that his father}} sent him off to cable America, and he has <b>just</b> <b>received</b> a <b>reply</b> which indicates that the real Agent Andrews was murdered in San Francisco three weeks earlier. The false [...] "James Andrews" [...] is really {{the leader of the}} Marloff gang, and intended to have the gang murder Charlie in a shoot-out when they descended through the trap door. Charlie knew Andrews did not really call the police, and had Lee summon them instead. Nash's escape from police custody was planned by Charlie. Charlie reveals that Forrest used the ink pad to put Nash's thumbprint on the revolver to frame him. Nash is declared innocent, and Andrews and Forrest go to jail.|$|R

Statistics from threads that <b>received</b> <b>replies</b> were compared to threads that did not <b>receive</b> <b>replies.</b> The average number of terms used in threads that <b>received</b> <b>replies</b> was lower than threads that did not <b>receive</b> <b>replies</b> across all 13 groups.

Adopting {{a social}} network {{analysis}} approach, the present study examined social capital and network dynamics of online support seeking and support provision in a depression forum. We constructed a depression forum network by mapping {{out all of the}} users and the reply ties among them. The findings showed a consistently reciprocal pattern between users’ replies sent to others and <b>replies</b> <b>received</b> from others. Forum users’ bridging social capital was positively associated with the source diversity of their <b>received</b> <b>replies</b> and negatively associated with the average length of their <b>received</b> <b>replies.</b> Furthermore, forum users’ bonding social capital was positively associated with the average length of their <b>received</b> <b>replies</b> and negatively associated with the source diversity of their <b>received</b> <b>replies...</b>|$|R

Gentlemen [...] Yours of the 22 nd <b>just</b> <b>received</b> and in <b>reply</b> {{would say}} that I saw Robert {{for a few minutes}} on Sunday and that he {{mentioned}} he had received a box from Bryant and that they never seemed to forget their men. He left Washington on Dec. 12 to go to O. C. S. in Miami Beach and last week came to Harvard Statistical School to complete the O C. S. course. Apparently the box was forwarded from Washington to Miami and reached there shortly before he left for Boston along with a box that left Pawtucket on Dec. 3 which he received at the same time. He {{said he was going to}} write you the first spare minute he had. He expects to be at Harvard for six weeks. I will personally notify you of his new address when he leaves there. I do, as well as he does, appreciate all you have done for the service men. At present his address is O/C Robert E. Southworth A. A. F. Statistical School Mellon Hall Rm.

30|$|In Algorithm 1, start_time and arrival_time are {{the local}} clock {{times at which}} a test is started and the {{corresponding}} reply arrives at the tester, respectively. Variable test_time corresponds to the time a tester takes to <b>receive</b> a <b>reply.</b> Variable mean maintains the weighted mean of the time to <b>receive</b> <b>replies.</b> The dispersion of the time to <b>receive</b> a <b>reply</b> is kept in variance and is also computed as a weighted mean. The higher the variance, the larger the timeout. Constants α and β were assigned 0.9 and 4, respectively, which are frequently used as approximations of the original values proposed by Jacobson [52]. Variable threshold is computed by adding the timeout to a factor defined by the user. This factor is frequently added to avoid false positives, i.e., incorrect suspicions.|$|R

50|$|First called ShareNet or S-Net, {{this network}} {{operating}} system (NOS) was later called Novell NetWare. NetWare {{was based on the}} NetWare Core Protocol (NCP), which is a packet-based protocol that enables a client to send requests to and <b>receive</b> <b>replies</b> from a NetWare server. Initially NCP was directly tied to the IPX/SPX protocol, and NetWare communicated natively using only IPX/SPX.|$|R
50|$|The client uses a {{database}} connection to send commands to and <b>receive</b> <b>replies</b> from the server.
