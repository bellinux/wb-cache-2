The engine was modified for the enclosed scooter by having a <b>drive</b> <b>pulley</b> on the crankshaft driving a fan by means of a Vee belt. There were four foot-operated gears.|$|E
50|$|Any V-belt's {{ability to}} <b>drive</b> <b>pulleys</b> depends on {{wrapping}} the belt around a sufficient {{angle of the}} pulley to provide grip. Where a single-V-belt {{is limited to a}} simple convex shape, it can adequately wrap at most three or possibly four <b>pulleys,</b> so can <b>drive</b> at most three accessories. Where more must be driven, such as for modern cars with power steering and air conditioning, multiple belts are required. As the polygroove belt can be bent into concave paths by external idlers, it can wrap any number of <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys,</b> limited only by the power capacity of the belt.|$|R

Curiously enough the DECSYSTEM 2020 can support an RM03 with its Unibus-based interface due to a highly buffered Unibus-to-memory interface.|$|E
50|$|In April 1953, Simplex added a {{variable}} speed automatic transmission with centrifugal shoe-type clutch and belt-type automatic transmission. The ratio was changed by {{expanding and contracting}} the <b>drive</b> <b>pulley,</b> with a low ratio of approximately 18:1 and a high ratio of approximately 7:1. The transmission was belt-driven and drove the real wheel by belt, with automatic belt tensioning by jockey pulley.|$|E
50|$|An {{underdrive}} pulley {{refers to}} a crankshaft or accessory pulley (a/c, alternator, power steering, water pump, etc.) designed to turn at a slower speed than stock. To Underdrive means to slow the rate of rotation in a system. Underdrive is achieved by either making the crank/main (<b>drive)</b> <b>pulley</b> smaller or the accessory (driven) pulley larger than the original diameter pulleys.|$|E
50|$|The winch house {{associated}} with the cable system is extant on the site just {{to the north of}} the pithead. This structure is a brown, chamfer board hut with a corrugated iron roof. The hut contains a large electric motor connected to a belt <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> system. The <b>pulleys</b> <b>drive</b> a large metal winding drum. A small section of cable remains connected to the drum. A number of operational signs remain extant on the walls of the hut together with chalked notes dating from the early 1980s.|$|R
50|$|The DAF 600 was {{the first}} car to have a {{continuously}} variable transmission (CVT) system - the innovative DAF Variomatic., the same system was carried over to the 750 and its variants. The DAF Variomatic employs centrifugal weights to control the drive ratio of the transmission and is enhanced by the engine manifold vacuum. The action of the bob weights and inlet vacuum combined to pull together the cheeks of two, variable diameter, driving <b>pulleys,</b> <b>driven</b> directly from the engine. These were connected, by rubber 'V' belts, to two similar <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys,</b> connected to the drive wheels. The cheeks of the <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys</b> were held together by spring tension, which was progressively overcome as the <b>drive</b> <b>pulleys</b> expanded and the tension of the belts increased. The DAF Variomatics were thereby the only cars ever produced which went faster by the simple expedient of gently and gradually releasing the accelerator once top engine speed had been reached, as the increased vacuum took over from the reducing bob weight speed. The Variomatic also permitted increased engine braking by operating a switch on the dashboard which reversed {{the action of the}} vacuum on the pulley's diaphragm, seeking a lower ratio with increased manifold vacuum. Two separate transmissions ran the two driving wheels, eliminating the need for a differential. The two transmissions could provide different drive ratios, permitting the wheels to rotate at different speeds. The duplication also provided redundancy. If one belt broke, the vehicle could still be driven.An interesting feature: putting the car in reverse reversed the entire drive system. This enabled the vehicle, at least the earlier examples, in theory to reach the same top speed in reverse as forward.|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} {{of a local}} reduction of stiffness in a synchronous belt was experimentally studied by monitoring the vibrations of {{the support of the}} <b>driven</b> <b>pulley.</b> The lack of teeth in a synchronous belt is the cause of variations in the forces exchanged between the belt and pulley compared to the forces exchanged in a healthy belt. These variations in force lead to a different vibratory behavior of the bodies of the transmission and can be highlighted by analyzing the vibratory signals. A workbench for the diagnostic study of mechanical transmissions was equipped, and acceleration measurements were performed on the support of the <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> under the working conditions of some healthy and defective belts. Comparing the power spectra of the measured accelerations in both cases, meaningful variations in the amplitude of the peaks were observed at frequencies multiple of the frequency of turn of the belt. This result was obtained using some particular test and measurement conditions. A diagnostic procedure for detecting defects in synchronous belts was developed...|$|R

The skyline's cable loop runs around a <b>drive</b> <b>pulley,</b> generally at the central delivery end, and the return pulley at the collection end; the collection-end pulley may be moved radially to other locations within {{the constraints of the}} system, and may operate over large areas.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 19th century, British millwrights {{discovered}} that multi-grooved pulleys connected by ropes outperformed flat pulleys connected by leather belts. Wire ropes were occasionally used, but cotton, hemp, manila {{hemp and flax}} rope saw the widest use. Typically, the rope connecting two pulleys with multiple V-grooves was spliced into a single loop that traveled along a helical path before being returned to its starting position by an idler pulley that also served to maintain the tension on the rope. Sometimes, a single rope was used to transfer power from one multiple-groove <b>drive</b> <b>pulley</b> to several single- or multiple-groove driven pulleys in this way.|$|E
40|$|During {{the work}} of {{transmitter}} with jagged belt, where the belt is ingrained with the pulleys, the power transmits from the driving <b>pulley</b> to <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> through two kinds of forces (the force between the ingrained teeth in pulling layer of belt and the force the acts aside the ingrained teeth).

50|$|The {{second type}} of E engines was a single {{overhead}} cam design, used to replace the OHV A series. The SOHC head was a new aluminum alloy design fitted to a cast iron block. It {{was derived from the}} A series by simply fitting a belt <b>drive</b> <b>pulley</b> to the nose of the crankshaft. The jackshaft being in place of the OHV camshaft still drove the oil pump as before. The E-series engine was first introduced in 1981 on the N10 Pulsar/Cherry series, and shortly afterwards on the B11 Sentra/Sunny models. The E-series was gradually replaced by the GA-series in 1988/89, although it soldiered on in secondary markets such as Southeast Asia. The Malaysian built B11 Nissan Sunny 130Y used the E13 until at least 1996.|$|E
50|$|On 17 June 2005, the company's sole flying {{technology}} demonstrator reached a rotorcraft milestone, but crashed {{on the next}} flight. The aircraft had been flying at 160 mph when the <b>drive</b> <b>pulley</b> to the propeller drive-shaft bolts failed in flight, reversing propeller thrust. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair but both crew members were unharmed. The accident set the company's development back at least ten months as a small wingless autogyro was not flown until 2006, and the Carter PAV (a subsequent 4-place manned compound rotorcraft, the N110AV) was not flown until 2011. Design of the PAV was begun during 2005. Carter says it has flown 186 kn at 18,000 feet and reached a Mu of 1.13, and Carter has applied to the FAA to change the PAVs certificate from research and development to demonstration.|$|E
50|$|A {{conveyor}} belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system {{is one of}} many types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of carrying medium—the {{conveyor belt}}—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the belt forward. The powered pulley is called the <b>drive</b> <b>pulley</b> while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley. There are two main industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand, overburden and more.|$|E

The teeth on the belt keep the camshaft <b>drive</b> <b>pulleys</b> indexed. On older Ducati motors, prior to 1986, drive was by solid shaft that transferred to the camshaft through bevel-cut gears. This method of valve actuation was used on many of Ducati's older single-cylinder motorcycles — the shaft tube is visible {{on the outside of}} the cylinder.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} work closed form {{relationships}} {{for the power}} losses in rubber V-belt CVT are obtained, together with expressions for the axial thrust on both the driving and <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys,</b> starting fromsimple physical hypotheses. Losses have been grouped into threemain contributions: frictional sliding losses, longitudinal and lateral material hysteresis and frictional losses due to the engagement/disengagement of the belt at the entrance and exit from the pulleys. In {{order to keep the}} model simple and to obtain a closed form solution, circumferential slip is assumed to take place mainly in the <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> and the sliding angle is assumed constant along the sliding portion of the contact arc. Themodel was validated through comparisonwith experimental results obtained on a dedicated test bench capable of measuring the transmitted torques and the axial thrusts on both pulleys, the pulleys rotating speeds and the total belt tension. The sliding angle γ and the damping coefficient Ψ,which were introduced in the analytical relationships,were determined by a best fit procedure {{on the basis of the}} obtained experimental results. After having obtained those parameters, the model appeared to be capable of reproducing with a fairly satisfactory agreement the power losses, as well as the axial loads on the pulleys, which were obtained in different operating conditions; thus it is proposed as a useful tool for the design of this kind of transmission...|$|R
40|$|Serpentine {{belt drive}} systems {{are widely used}} in {{automobiles}} due to their compactness and long life. These systems are composed of a belt, a driving <b>pulley,</b> <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys,</b> and a spring-loaded tensioner. The <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys</b> may include such accessories as the alternator, air conditioner, or power steering pump. Serpentine belt drives experience {{many different types of}} steady state motions and transient vibrations due to the different parameters in the system. As a result of this, it is important to create a mathematical model that allows the designer to extract information about the system such as the natural frequency and the mode shapes. The accuracy of the model will depend primarily on the assumptions used. In particular, a key assumption is whether transverse and rotational motions of the belt are coupled due to the motion of the automatic belt tensioner. This coupling is often neglected by authors who model only longitudinal belt response and in effect decouple the transverse and rotational motions. Using a solution based upon coupled motion as well as a solution employing rotational motion only, the importance of this coupling will be assessed. Both solution results will be compared against published experimental data. In addition, a parametric study will be performed to determine the ability of the coupled and decoupled models to accurately predict changes in system natural frequencies and mode shapes due to changes in system parameters...|$|R
50|$|In {{this most}} common CVT system, {{there are two}} V-belt pulleys that are split {{perpendicular}} to their axes of rotation, with a V-belt running between them. The gear ratio is changed by moving the two sheaves of one pulley closer together and the two sheaves of the other pulley farther apart. The V-shaped {{cross section of the}} belt causes it to ride higher on one pulley and lower on the other. This changes the effective diameters of both pulleys, which changes the overall gear ratio. As the distance between the pulleys and the length of the belt does not change both pulleys must be adjusted (one bigger, the other smaller) simultaneously {{in order to maintain the}} proper amount of tension on the belt. Simple CVTs combining a centrifugal <b>drive</b> <b>pulley</b> with a spring loaded driven pulley often use belt tension to effect the conforming adjustments in the driven pulley. The V-belt needs to be very stiff in the pulley's axial direction in order to make only short radial movements while sliding in and out of the pulleys.|$|E

The result is that the required degree of timing accuracy could not otherwise be maintained.|$|R
40|$|An {{iterative}} modeling {{strategy is}} applied to low power rubber-belt continuously variable transmissions (CVTs) with the aim to (1) gain understanding of the belt-pulley force interactions, particularly for helically constrained pulley halves, and (2) generate steady-state models of CVT behavior. In addition, new designs for driver pulleys are presented and evaluated which incorporate direct electro-mechanical actuation of the CVT. Two of these new designs are built and tested to evaluate their performance and to validate the modeling work. The results of the belt-pulley force interaction research indicates that (1) the iterative modeling strategy is a viable approach for discovering the physics that dominate {{the behavior of the}} CVT, (2) the torque distribution between helically constrained pulley halves is not equal, (3) the torque distribution between helically constrained pulley halves depends very strongly on the speed difference between the pulley halves, the shear stiffness properties of the belt, and the coefficient of friction between the belt and the pulley halves, and (4) there is considerable value to pursuing further the understanding of the physics of the load sharing on helically constrained pulley halves, because most <b>driven</b> <b>pulleys</b> for rubber-belt CVTs are of this type. The results of the steady-state modeling effort for CVTs indicates that (1) helically constrained driver pulley halves are probably not viable design options, and (2) understanding the load sharing on the <b>driven</b> <b>pulley</b> halves is key to modeling the complete CVT, especially for belt engagement and low ratio operation. The prototype evaluation showed that the new designs are viable, and confirmed the modeling predictions. ...|$|R
