As the ratio between the logic {{capacity}} {{and the number of}} I/Os for each FPGA generation is increasing, FPGA I/Os are becoming a scarce resource. In order to resolve pin limitation problem, cut nets are sent between FPGAs in a pipelined way using the Time-Division-Multiplexing technique. The maximum number of cut nets passing through one FPGA I/O is called the TDM ratio. There are three inter-FPGA communication architectures: Logic Multiplexing, ISERDES/OSERDES and Multi-Gigabit Transceiver (MGT). Only Logic Multiplexing and ISERDES/OSERDES are today used for Time-Division-Multiplexing in the multi-FPGA based prototyping.

One of its advantages is the possibility to share the capacity of any wavelength among more than one user, through TDM/WDM <b>hybrid</b> <b>multiplexing.</b> However, it is still an open issue which transmission technology (DWDM transmitters, colorless transmitters, coherent detection, direct detection) can more effectively satisfy the requirements and characteristics of the future long-reach access network.

40|$|The volume {{holographic}} correlator (VHC) is {{a highly}} parallel processor. For an angularly multiplexed VHC, the processing speed {{is limited by the}} ratio of the maximum angle range and the minimum angle interval of the reference beam. Limited by the angle scanning range of the reference beam, the pure angular multiplexing in the reference beam of the VHC can only establish thousands of parallel correlation channels, which is far from the high parallelism demand for real-time applications. In this paper, the maximum multiplexing number of the VHC system is increased. The polarized and phase-encoded multiplexing methods are introduced into the object beam, with the angular multiplexing method in the reference beam. The mutual orthogonality of the polarization multiplexing, phase-encoded multiplexing and angular multiplexing methods are verified with experiment. This shows that the number of parallel channels can be increased with the object beam both polarized and phase-encoded multiplexed and with the reference beam still angularly multiplexed in the VHC.

40|$|The main {{theme of}} this paper is the traffic {{management}} for the broadband networks operating under the Asynchronous T’ransfer Mode (ATM). The design of hybrid traffic management algorithms for the multiplexing of heterogenous classes of data over a common digital channel is of particular interest. Within the Broadband Integrated Services Digital Network (B-ISDN) environment, we focus on the following traffic classes: voice, video, high-speed data and low speed data. Each tr&c category imposes different Quality of Service (QOS) requirements while simultaneously presenting traffic input rates which may vary dynamically. The prime issue is the deployment of <b>Hybrid</b> <b>Multiplexing</b> Algorithms (HMAs) which satisfy both the constraints and QOSs of all traffic categories, while simultaneously attaining high channel utilization and induce low implementation overhead. A class of HMAs corresponds to a semidynamic capacity allocation approach, generally applicable to environments where traffic rates vary relatively slowly and their statistics are parametrically known. These semidynamic HMAs induce frame structures, where the capacity allocation per frame is dictated by a superimposed traffic monitoring algorithm (TMA). A key attribute of our TMA is its ability to quickly detect shifts in the rates of the traffics it monitors. The decisions induced by the TMA represent traffic characterization. For traffic management they dictate pertinent capacity allocations per traffic class and may also be fed back to the input traffic cells to control the traffic load accordingly. I...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{multiple}} access protocol and a call acceptance algorithm for voice and data integration in a microcellular mobile communication system is presented. The protocol supports three service classes, namely, circuit-mode voice, burst-mode voice, and data. A <b>hybrid</b> <b>multiplexing</b> scheme with no boundaries is employed, which performs statistical multiplexing of connections of three classes at two different levels, the call-level (for circuit-mode voice) and the talkspurt/message-level (for burst-mode voice and data). This scheme achieves high {{utilization of the}} available bandwidth compared to the pure-circuit-switching scheme. The penalty paid is a lower quality in the latter two classes, due to the delay experienced during channel access on each talkspurt/message. A two-party transaction modeling for each class is implemented giving a realistic load on uplink and downlink. Data messages are segmented before transmission and a lower priority of the preemptive type at segment boundaries is assigned to them, {{in favor of the}} voice talkspurts transmission.

40|$|Volume Holographic Data Storage Systems (HDSS) {{has been}} of {{interest}} for almost seven decades, and are now considered as a viable option for Write Once Read Many (WORM) cold data storage applications. Thanks to the Bragg selectivity of thick volume holograms, HDSS stores several hundreds of holograms {{on top of each}} other, called multiplexed data pages, by which data recording density can be substantially increased compared to surface recordings. On the other hand, signal intensity upon reconstruction of such multiplexed data pages inversely scales with number of multiplexing squared. Therefore, longer detection time and/or a high power laser along with a large dynamic range material is needed to make HDSS a truly viable "fast and high density" option for WORM applications. Historically, the trade-off between data density and data rate is well recognized. The challenge has been partially solved by continuous efforts such as improvement of materials, optical architectures, opto-mechanical systems and signal processing [1, 2]. In this dissertation, we provide an additional pathway for HDSS to further increase both data density and transfer rates which is Cavities Enhancement Techniques for HDSS, to overcome the fundamental tradeoff. Key ideas are: recycling light with cavity to enhance data rate, and increasing number of multiplexing by combining cavity-eigenmode multiplexing, a subset of orthogonal phasecode multiplexing, with angular multiplexing. Based on this idea, we design and demonstrate Cavity-enhanced HDSS {{in such a way that}} we increase data rate and/or data density by at least factor of 2 while taking advantage of previous improvements as they are, or only with the minimum amount of modifications. In Section 1, we review history of HDSS and summarize the latest research results of HDSS and requirements on modern optical data storage systems as they relate to our solutions. In Section 2, theory of volume holography is reviewed by emphasizing understanding of angular and orthogonal phase code multiplexing. In Section 3 the theory of cavity enhanced reference arms is presented.

Design/methodology/approach: Ti 6 Al 4 V substrates were diffusion hardened with interstitial O or N atoms with use of glow discharge plasma in the atmosphere Ar+O 2 or Ar+N 2. Next they were deposited with a hard gradient TiCxNy layer and with a hard amorphous a-C coating as the top one. The morphology, microstructure, chemical and phase composition, chemical bonds, microhardness and tribological properties during dry friction of the alloy after multiplex treatment have been investigated with use of SEM, EDS, XRD, XPS, Vickers diamond indenter and ball-on-plate test. Findings: An important increase of hardness of the near surface zone of the Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy has been achieved (from ~ 350 VHN to ~ 1000 VHN), good adhesion between the gradient TiCxNy coating and the Ti 6 Al 4 V substrate {{as well as an}} important decrease of dry friction coefficient (down to ~ 0. 15) and a substantial increase of the resistance to wear (up to two orders of magnitude in comparison with non treated Ti alloy).

The model also simply shows how coherent QPSK is more affected by XPM than incoherent DQPSK, and allows to infer that even more impact is expected when the baudrate is further reduced through polarization multiplexing.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the recent {{applications}} of optical parametric amplifiers (OPAs) in <b>hybrid</b> wavelength division <b>multiplexing</b> (WDM) /time division multiplexing (TDM) local area passive optical networks have been modeled and parametrically investigated over {{wide range of}} the affecting parameters. Moreover, we have analyzed {{the ability of the}} hybrid WDM/TDM Passive optical networks to handle a triple play solution, offering voice, video, and data services to the multiple users. Finally, we have investigated the maximum time division multiplexing (MTDM) bit rates for optical network units (ONUs) for maximum number of supported users with optical parametric amplifier technique across the single mode fiber (SMF) or highly nonlinear fiber (HNLF) cables to achieve both maximum network reach and quality of service (QOS).
