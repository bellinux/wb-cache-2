40|$|The paper {{examines}} {{possible reasons}} behind expanded outsourcing by modeling outsourcing decisions when {{intellectual property rights}} are <b>imperfectly</b> <b>protected.</b> Firms in the North develop higher quality levels of existing products and then decide whether to shift some stages of production to the South. Production in the South lowers costs but entails risk of imitation by Southern firms. In this setting, a lower risk of imita-tion or larger labor supplies can cause increased outsourcing, {{a higher rate of}} innovation, and a lower North-ern relative wage. Damage due to lower incomes can be offset by gains in terms of better quality products. 1...|$|R

40|$|This paper models {{outsourcing}} decisions when {{intellectual property}} rights are <b>imperfectly</b> <b>protected.</b> Firms in the advanced North develop higher quality levels of existing products and then decide whether to shift a basic stage of production to the South, where production costs are lower. However, production of even the basic stage in the South entails a risk of imitation by Southern Þrms. The larger this risk of imitation, the lower the rate of innovation,and the higher the relative wage. The increased relative wage raises the cost savings from outsourcing, which offsets {{the reduction in the}} expected duration of proÞts due to imitation. Additionally, a larger world labor supply has the opposite effect — accelerating innovation while reducing the relative wage...|$|R

40|$|In {{a recent}} spate of highly publicized incidents, {{citizens}} have used cell phones equipped with video cameras to record violent arrests. Oftentimes they post their recordings on the Internet for public examination. As {{the courts have}} recognized, this behavior lies close {{to the heart of}} the First Amendment. But the Constitution <b>imperfectly</b> <b>protects</b> this new form of government monitoring. Fourth Amendment doctrine generally permits the warrantless seizure of cell phones used to record violent arrests, on the theory that the recording contains evidence of a crime. The Fourth Amendment inquiry does not evaluate a seizing officer 2 ̆ 7 s state of mind, permitting an official to seize a video for the very purpose of suppressing its contents. Moreover, Supreme Court precedent is typically read to ignore First Amendment interests implicated by searches and seizures. This result is perverse. Courts evaluating these seizures should stop to recall the Fourth Amendment 2 ̆ 7 s origins as a procedural safeguard for expressive interests. They should remember, too, the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s jurisprudence surrounding seizures of obscene materials—an area in which the Court carefully shaped Fourth Amendment doctrine to protect First Amendment values. Otherwise reasonable seizures can become unreasonable when they threaten free expression, and seizures of cell phones used to record violent arrests are of that stripe. Courts should therefore disallow this breed of seizure, trusting the political branches to craft a substitute procedure that will <b>protect</b> law-enforcement <b>interests</b> without doing violence to First Amendment freedoms...|$|R

40|$|Using {{a dynamic}} {{framework}} with strategic interactions, we study {{the management of}} a non-renewable natural resource when property rights are generally weak. Under generally weak property rights both the resource stock and the revenues from exploiting it are <b>imperfectly</b> <b>protected,</b> due to trespassing and theft respectively. Trespassing and theft affect the legitimate owner 2 ̆ 019 s extraction decision: extracting the resource today protects the stock against trespassing but exposes the revenues to theft. Moreover, in an evolving institutional setting, the anticipation {{of a change in}} the strength of property rights further distorts the extraction decision: e. g., if the owner anticipates stronger property rights in the future, extraction is delayed. Our results indicate that the depletion of the resource is decreasing in the intensity of theft. In addition, when the owner and the trespassers are affected by theft, the depletion of the resource is below (above) the social optimal level if the intensity of theft is high (low) ...|$|R
