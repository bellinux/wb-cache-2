2500|$|Waste streams rich in {{hardness}} ions as from de-ionisation processes {{can readily}} lose the hardness ions in {{a buildup of}} precipitated calcium and magnesium salts. This precipitation process can cause severe furring of pipes and can, in extreme cases, cause the blockage of disposal pipes. [...] A 1-metre diameter industrial marine <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> serving a major chemicals complex was blocked by such salts in the 1970s. Treatment is by concentration of de-ionisation waste waters and disposal to landfill or by careful pH management of the released wastewater.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1990s, {{state and}} federal health and {{environmental}} agencies identified an increased incidence of childhood cancers in Toms River from the 1970-1995 period. [...] Multiple investigations by {{state and federal}} environmental and health agencies indicated that the likely source of the increased cancer risk was contamination from Toms River Chemical Plant (then operated by Ciba-Geigy), which had been in operation since 1952. [...] The area was designated a United States Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site in 1983 after an underground plume of toxic chemicals was identified. [...] The following year, a <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> was shut down after a sinkhole {{at the corner of}} Bay Avenue and Vaughn Avenue revealed that it had been leaking. [...] The plant ceased operation in 1996. [...] A follow up study from the 1996-2000 period indicated that while there were more cancer cases than expected, rates had significantly fallen and the difference was statistically insignificant compared to normal statewide cancer rates. [...] Since 1996, the Toms River water system has been subject to the most stringent water testing in the state and is considered safe for consumption. Dan Fagin's Toms River: A Story of Science and Salvation, the 2014 Pulitzer Prize winning book, examined the issue of industrial pollution in detail.|$|E
60|$|In the meantime, {{he watched}} the pump. The engine carried a {{dangerous}} load and the spouting <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> was swollen. Throbbing and rattling, she fought the water that held Arcturus down. A greaser touched the crosshead-slides with a tallow swab, and a panting fireman thrust a bar through the furnace door. Their skin was blackened by sweat and coal dust; soaked singlets, tight like gloves, clung to their lean bodies. Nobody else, however, was actively occupied. The negroes lay on the deck and the white men lounged {{in the shade of}} the awning. They had done all that flesh and blood could do, in a climate that breaks the white man's strength, and now the tide ought to finish their labor. But they did not know, and some doubted.|$|E

60|$|Lister got up with {{an effort}} {{and went to the}} pump, which {{presently}} began to throb. The mended engine ran well and the regular splash of water, flung out from the big <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe,</b> drowned the languid rumble of the surf. The hull shook; shadowy figures crossed the beam of light from the furnace, and vanished in the dark. Twinkling lamps threw broken reflections on the water that looked like black silk, lightning flashed in the background, and when the swell broke with phosphorescent sparkles about the wreck Lister marked the height the pale illumination crept up her plates. She would not lift that tide, but the pump was clearing the hold, and he hoped much water was not coming in. If the leakage was not excessive, her bow ought to rise when the next tide flowed.|$|E
50|$|A {{positive}} displacement pump makes a fluid move by trapping a fixed amount and forcing (displacing) that trapped volume into the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe.</b>|$|E
50|$|Water heaters {{potentially}} can explode {{and cause}} significant damage, injury, or death if certain safety devices are not installed. A safety device called a temperature and pressure relief (T&P or TPR) valve, is normally fitted {{on the top}} of the water heater to dump water if the temperature or pressure becomes too high. Most plumbing codes require that a <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> be connected to the valve to direct the flow of discharged hot water to a drain, typically a nearby floor drain, or outside the living space. Some building codes allow the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> to terminate in the garage.|$|E
30|$|The use of porous ducts {{to deliver}} water to {{agricultural}} fields {{is an old}} technique which helps saving water and prevents ground erosion. Designing porous duct is not as a simple task as it looks and apparently {{has never been the}} subject of mathematical research. Here the problem is addressed making use of a double rescaling of space and velocity variables, which allows the derivation of the governing equations starting from the study of the classical Navier Stokes equations in a pipe. Such equations are then solved obtaining results of practical interest in design of irrigation pipes, both for low <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> (small plants) and for high <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> (large plants).|$|R
30|$|In {{this paper}} we will analyze the {{low and high}} <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> separately.

25|$|One {{disadvantage}} of land-based facilities {{arises from the}} turbulent wave action in the surf zone. OTEC <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> should be placed in protective trenches to prevent subjecting them to extreme stress during storms and prolonged periods of heavy seas. Also, the mixed discharge of cold and warm seawater {{may need to be}} carried several hundred meters offshore to reach the proper depth before it is released, requiring additional expense in construction and maintenance.|$|R
25|$|One {{way that}} OTEC systems can avoid {{some of the}} {{problems}} and expenses of operating in a surf zone is by building them just offshore in waters ranging from 10 to 30 meters deep (Ocean Thermal Corporation 1984). This type of plant would use shorter (and therefore less costly) intake and <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes,</b> which would avoid the dangers of turbulent surf. The plant itself, however, would require protection from the marine environment, such as breakwaters and erosion-resistant foundations, and the plant output would need to be transmitted to shore.|$|R
50|$|An airlift pump is a pump {{that has}} low suction and {{moderate}} discharge of liquid and entrained solids. The pump injects compressed {{air at the}} bottom of the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> which is immersed in the liquid. The compressed air mixes with the liquid causing the air-water mixture to be less dense than the rest of the liquid around it and therefore is displaced upwards through the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> by the surrounding liquid of higher density. Solids may be entrained in the flow and if small enough to fit through the pipe, will be discharged with the rest of the flow at a shallower depth or above the surface. Airlift pumps are widely used in aquaculture to pump, circulate and aerate water in closed, recirculating systems and ponds. Other applications include dredging, underwater archaeology, salvage operations and collection of scientific specimens.|$|E
50|$|Dredge pipe {{pieces are}} a variety of pipes on board of {{dredgers}} like bend pipe, T-pipe, pitched T-pipe, Y-pipe, cross pipe, strait pipe, and conical pipe. These dredge pipe pieces are used on-board of dredgers to connect the dredge pump with the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe.</b> Mostly the pipes are made from cast steel. Sometime welded pipes are used.|$|E
50|$|There is also {{an issue}} {{surrounding}} the pollution of the lagoon. Nearby freezing works have previously pumped waste water into the lagoon. Workers in charge of checking this <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> also noted thinning of the barrier as early as 1897. More recently there has been concern about the pollution runoff from the Washdyke industrial area immediately {{to the west of}} the lagoon.|$|E
50|$|The dam was 72 feet (22 m) {{high and}} 931 feet (284 m) long. Between 1881 when the South Fork Fishing and Hunting Club was opened, and 1889, the dam {{frequently}} sprang leaks. It was patched, mostly with mud and straw. Additionally, a previous owner had removed and sold for scrap the three cast iron <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> that previously allowed a controlled release of water. There {{had been some}} speculation as to the dam's integrity, and concerns had been raised {{by the head of}} the Cambria Iron Works downstream in Johnstown.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to closing on Ruff's purchase, Congressman Reilly had crucial <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> {{removed and}} sold for their value as scrap steel, {{so there was}} no {{practical}} way to lower the level of water behind the dam should repairs be indicated. [...] Ruff, while he was not a civil engineer, had a background that included being a railroad tunnel contractor and supervised the repairs to the dam, which did not include a successful resolution of the inability to discharge the water and substantially lower the lake for repair purposes.|$|R

50|$|Rotodynamic pumps (or dynamic pumps) are {{a type of}} {{velocity}} pump {{in which}} kinetic energy {{is added to the}} fluid by increasing the flow velocity. This increase in energy is converted to a gain in potential energy (pressure) when the velocity is reduced prior to or as the flow exits the pump into the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe.</b> This conversion of kinetic energy to pressure is explained by the First law of thermodynamics, or more specifically by Bernoulli's principle.|$|E
50|$|On Wednesday 21 November 1900, the Fenella {{departed}} Douglas at 09:00hrs on {{a regular}} service to Liverpool. As Fenella cleared to the southeast of Douglas Bay she developed problems with her <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe,</b> {{as a consequence of}} the condenser being choked. Fenella had been moored in the outer harbour at Douglas the previous night, and refuse discharges from a hopper barge had been washed up by the incoming tide, choking the pipe. The problem was quickly rectified, and the Fenella returned to service.|$|E
50|$|The inner {{diameter}} of dredge ball joint pipes ranges from 400 mm to 1200 mm. Dredge ball joint liners {{can be produced}} from steel and hard iron materials. To allow for variations of the tilting angle, the ball turning angle of a dredge ball joint is 15 degrees to 18 degrees, and the <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> variation for a dredge ball joint ranges from 10 mm to 30 mm. The dredge ball joints are made to operate at low, medium and high pressure.|$|E
40|$|The {{first section}} of this diploma thesis pursues an {{algorithm}} design of flood wave transformation in Excel software and its application afterwards.

50|$|The 3 {{cast iron}} <b>discharge</b> <b>pipes</b> had {{previously}} allowed a controlled release of water. When the initial renovation was completed under Ruff's oversight, {{it was now}} impossible to drain the lake to repair the dam properly. Moreover, {{in order to provide}} a carriageway across the dam, the top was leveled off, lowering it, leaving it only a few feet above the water level at its lowest point. To compound the problem, the owners and managers had erected fish screens across the mouth of the spillway, and these became clogged with debris, restricting the outflow of water.|$|R

50|$|Fulton's design {{expanded}} the facility to three pools in 1940. The first pool contained the spring itself and was 18' x 10' and mostly 8 feet deep; the middle pool was 170' x 25' and 3 feet deep; the last pool was 140' x 25' and 8 feet deep. Total volume {{was more than}} 300,000 gallons. It included 1 meter and 3 meter springboards. The pool's drain is on the bottom beneath the 3 meter concrete platform, where water flows through a <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> and creates the Glen Springs Run.|$|E
50|$|In 1966, {{around the}} same time as the first JX wagons were being constructed, a handful of {{components}} were used to build the first two FX wagons for flour transport.

In 1970-71 the class was increased to 17, though these were built to a slightly different design, with only one <b>discharge</b> <b>pipe</b> instead of three. By 1978 the earlier wagons had been modified to match the later design. In 1979 the code was altered to VPFX.|$|E
30|$|The jet {{velocity}} Vj {{coming out}} from <b>discharging</b> <b>pipe</b> outlet having opening area of Ï€Â·DÂ·YÂ·cosÎ¸ can be calculated by dividing the discharge, Q, by the opening area of flow at the device exit.

This constant jet length is used with each inclination angle jets so that the comparative analysis of the jet angles would be uniform.|$|R
