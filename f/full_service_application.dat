5000|$|The {{most common}} use {{case for the}} ATS system was to alert the {{railroad}} engineer of an impending hazard and if the alert was not acknowledged, stop the train {{by means of a}} <b>full</b> <b>service</b> <b>application</b> of the brakes. When attached to signals the shoe would be energized when the signal was displaying a [...] "Clear" [...] indication. Any other signal indication would de-energize the shoe and trigger an alarm in the cab. If the engineer did not cancel the alarm within 5-8 seconds a penalty brake application would be initiated and could not be reset until the train came to a complete stop. Unlike mechanical train stops or other train stop systems, IIATS was not generally used to automatically stop a train if it passed a stop signal and in practice could not be used for this purpose as the shoes were placed only {{a few feet from the}} signal they protected and would not present sufficient braking distance for the train to stop.|$|E
