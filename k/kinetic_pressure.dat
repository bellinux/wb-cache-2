A P(0) of roughly (3. 9 + or - 0. 6) x 10 to the - 12 th dyn/sq cm is obtained, with roughly equal contributions from magnetic field, cosmic ray, and kinetic terms. This boundary condition restricts both the magnitude of gravity and the high z-pressure. It favors lower gravity and higher values for the cosmic ray, magnetic field, and probably the <b>kinetic</b> <b>pressures</b> than have been popular in the past.

40|$|We derive {{a number}} of {{solution}} for one-dimensional dynamics of relativistic magnetized plasma {{that can be used}} as benchmark estimates in relativistic hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic numerical codes. First, we analyze the properties of simple waves of fast modes propagating orthogonally to the magnetic field in relativistically hot plasma. The magnetic and <b>kinetic</b> <b>pressures</b> obey different equations of state, so that the system behaves as a mixture of gases with different polytropic indices. We find the self-similar solutions for the expansion of hot strongly magnetized plasma into vacuum. Second, we derive linear hodograph and Darboux equations for the relativistic Khalatnikov potential, which describe arbitrary one-dimensional isentropic relativistic motion of cold magnetized plasma and find their general and particular solutions. The obtained hodograph and Darboux equations are very powerful: system of highly non-linear, relativistic, time dependent equations describing arbitrary (not necessarily self-similar) dynamics of highly magnetized plasma reduces to a single linear differential equation.

Mass inertia moment vectors and corresponding deviational vector components for pole and oriented axis are defined by K. Hedrih in 1991. These kinematical vectors rotators are defined for a system with {{two degrees of freedom}} as well as for rheonomic system with two degrees of mobility and one degree of freedom and coupled rotations around two coupled axes without intersection as well as their angular velocities and intensity. As an example of defined dynamics, we take into consideration a heavy gyrorotor disk with one degree of freedom and coupled rotations when one component of rotation is programmed by constant angular velocity. For this system with nonlinear dynamics, a series of tree parametric transformations of system nonlinear dynamics are presented.

40|$|It is a {{well known}} model of either fully ionized matter or of simple metals, the system which {{consists}} of an assembly of point charges (either ions or electrons) immersed in a neutralizing background and which was introduced by E. Wigner in 1938. In the last decades, this model {{has given rise to}} extensive numerical, heuristic and rigourous investigations. However, the fact that, until recently, most of the many-body theoretical investigations and of the numerical simulations (particularly in 2 and 3 D.) have been carried out on systems subject to periodic boundary conditions, has not permitted to consider the questions dealt with in this paper. We report new results on the equation of state of the classical version of this model, known as one component plasma, obtained by imposing free boundary conditions on the system, i. e. by confining the particles in a given domain [1, 5]. These conditions enable be the investigation of the physically meaningfull <b>kinetic</b> <b>pressure,</b> i. e. the pressure due to the transfer of momentum flow of the particles at the walls of the domain with the background being considered as strictly passive. It is shown i) that the <b>kinetic</b> <b>pressure</b> is equal to the virial pressure; ii) that it consists always of the thermal pressure (erroneously called virial pressure in the litterature), plus an excess pressure which can be analyzed in therms of a wall part and a bulk part; iii) that, in the thermodynamic limit, the bulk part of the excess pressure is a linear functional of the long range order parameter (periodic charge density), It is pointed out that since the <b>kinetic</b> <b>pressure</b> is ⩾ 0 while the thermal pressure becomes < 0, in all dimensions for low enough temperatures, then the excess pressure has {{to make up for the}} difference. This means in particular that, in the ground state, the excess pressure compensates exactly the Madelung pressure. Theoretical and numerical results obtained from molecular dynamics simulations (1 D.

Here, the magnetic instability is discussed in (A, beta) space (A is the anisotropy in {{the temperature of the}} plasma species and beta is the ratio of the <b>kinetic</b> <b>pressure</b> to the magnetic pressure), which can occur in generalized non-Maxwellian plasmas with an inverted population of different species...|$|E

40|$|Expansion of {{magnetized}} plasma in {{the magnetic}} field of a solenoid is studied by means of simulations using a 3 -dimensional hybrid code. The plasma expands against a high- density and slow plasma stream (PS). The expansion causes inflation of {{the magnetic field}}; near the solenoid the magnetic field variation with increasing distance (r) remains as B(alpha) r(sup - 3), but at farther distances B(alpha) r(sup -p), where the exponent p {{is found in the}} range 0. 5 approx. less than p approx. less than 1. 2 forming a plateau in the magnetic field distribution B(r). At the start of injection of plasma from the ends of the solenoid, the PS interacts with the solenoid magnetic field and creates a bow shock at a distance where the Larmor radius (r(sub il)) of the PS ions in the solenoid magnetic field nearly equals the scale length (L) of B(r), that is, r(sub il) approx. L = (B(sup - 1) dB L /dr) (sup - 1). As the injected plasma accumulates in the solenoid magnetic field, it expands inflating the magnetic field and the bow shock moves outward. The speed of the expansion front and the shock progressively decreases and eventually a stand-off occurs when the PS dynamic pressure is eventually balanced by the magnetic and <b>kinetic</b> <b>pressures</b> of the expanding plasma and the inflating magnetic field.
