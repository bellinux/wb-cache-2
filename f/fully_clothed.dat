5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{described}} as being as red as the hibiscus flower or as bright as a million suns. She is usually depicted as red or orange in complexion and sometimes as black. She is depicted mostly nude; however, she is so posed that her genitals are generally hidden or a multi-hooded cobra or jewellery around the waist covers them. She is depicted as being young and slim. She {{is described}} as a sixteen-year-old girl with full breasts, adorned with lotuses or having a single blue lotus near her heart. Sometimes, she is partially or <b>fully</b> <b>clothed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Chatwin spent an {{increasing}} {{amount of time}} in New York City. He continued to have affairs with men, but most of these affairs were short-lived. In 1977 he began his first serious affair with Donald Richards, an Australian stockbroker. Richards introduced him to the gay nightclub scene in New York. During this period Chatwin became acquainted with Robert Mapplethorpe, who photographed him. Chatwin {{is one of the few}} men Mapplethorpe photographed <b>fully</b> <b>clothed.</b> Chatwin later contributed the introduction to a book of Mapplethorpe's photographs, Lady, Lisa Lyon (1983).|$|E
5|$|Johansson {{has criticized}} {{the media for}} {{promoting}} an image that causes unhealthy diets and eating disorders among women, believing that being skinny is not attractive. In one article she wrote for HuffPost, Johansson encouraged the reader to maintain a healthy body. She appeared nude {{on the cover of}} the March 2006 issue of Vanity Fair alongside actress Keira Knightley and <b>fully</b> <b>clothed</b> fashion designer Tom Ford. This caused some controversy as it was believed the photo demonstrated that women are forced to flaunt their sexuality more often than men. In September 2011, nude photographs of Johansson hacked from her cell phone were published online. Following an FBI investigation, the perpetrator was arrested, pled guilty, and was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Johansson said the photos had been sent to her then-husband, Reynolds, three years before the incident. In 2014, Johansson won a lawsuit against French publisher, JC Lattès, for using her name and featuring a look-alike model of her in the novel The First Thing We Look At by Gregoire Delacourt. Johansson was awarded $3,400, a fraction of the $68,000 she had claimed.|$|E
5000|$|Later, Milton is startled when Vivian {{shows up}} in the middle of his act and starts doing a fan dance (though it is clear she is <b>fully,</b> if skimpily, <b>clothed).</b> When he drags her off the stage, the {{audience}} riots, and they all end up in jail. That leaves the carnival in dire financial straits, and owner Jason [...] "Pop" [...] Carter in danger of losing it to potential buyer Mrs. Minerva Henkle and unable to post bail for most of his people. Bogel reveals that he is now working for Mrs. Henkle. Faced with ruin, Pop reluctantly agrees to sell.|$|R
50|$|When a {{messenger}} informs Prescot that the Shanks, a mysterious race of raiders have attacked {{an island of}} Valka and he rushes out with a small force to beat them back. The small force, including Delia and Drak, are trapped in an island village and under attack when Prescot is teleported away by the Star Lords. He resists and refuses to take up battle in his new location, instead returning to Delia. The Gdoinye warns him of his foolishness to resist and once more he is teleported, arriving {{for the first time}} <b>fully</b> armed and <b>clothed.</b> Again he defies the Star Lords and for this he is banished to Earth, seemingly for good.|$|R
2500|$|Harrison's next magazine, Eyeful (1942–1955), {{was similar}} to Beauty Parade. The {{depicted}} women were still <b>fully,</b> or partially, <b>clothed</b> but were placed in more intimate positions. The models still had the girl-next-door look ("Glorifying the American Girl") and would feature a Wall Street secretary, Bettie Page, then supplementing her income for acting lessons. During this period Harrison hired Edythe Farrell from the National Police Gazette. Farrell, a psychology major from Hunter College, [...] "introduced her new boss to Krafft-Ebing's Psychopathia Sexualis {{and the idea that}} whips and chains and spike heels would sell." [...] Titter (1943–1955), which focused on sadomasochist themes—with women in bondage, handling whips or being spanked—began Harrison's move from [...] "wholesome" [...] looking models. Wink (1944–1955) also featured sadomasochist imagery, but contained a stronger element of fetishism. After World War II Harrison created Flirt (1947–1955), which mainly featured fetishist photo-stories. Harrison was not beyond posing himself with the models, [...] "playing everything from pith-helmeted white slaver to wife spanker." [...] To enhance sales he used three leading Petty Girl-like artists of the day to do the covers: Peter Driben, Earl Moran (AKA Steffa) and Billy De Vorss.|$|R

25|$|Boelcke won {{his first}} {{individual}} aerial combat while flying in E.3/15 on 19 August 1915. Just nine days later, {{he was a hero}} on the ground. He dived into a canal near his aerodrome, <b>fully</b> <b>clothed,</b> and rescued a drowning French boy, Albert DePlace. The child's parents wanted Boelcke to be awarded the French Legion d'Honneur; instead, he received the Prussian Lifesaving Medal.|$|E
25|$|The {{bodies of}} Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. Richardson were {{ejected from the}} plane on impact and {{probably}} tumbled along with the wreckage across the icy field before the mangled plane came to rest against a barbed-wire fence. While Peterson's body remained entangled in the main mass of plane wreckage, the <b>fully</b> <b>clothed</b> bodies of Holly and Valens came to rest several {{feet away from the}} wreckage on open ground.|$|E
25|$|Old skin {{body parts}} were {{available}} separately, so buyers could easily get pieces and assemble their own custom doll. After {{the change to}} pure skin, only certain hands and feet are available to buy as optional parts, {{and only a few}} pure skin head molds and body types are readily available as completed standard models. The majority of Super Dollfie models are now only available as limited editions, already assembled, painted, and <b>fully</b> <b>clothed.</b>|$|E
25|$|A vivid {{account of}} the {{conditions}} in Kolyma is that of Brother Gene Thompson of Kiev's Faith Mission. He recounts how he met Vyacheslav Palman, a prisoner who survived because {{he knew how to}} grow cabbages. Palman spoke of how guards read out the names of those to be shot every evening. On one occasion a group of 169 men were shot and thrown into a pit. Their <b>fully</b> <b>clothed</b> bodies were found after the ice melted in 1998.|$|E
25|$|When PAS was {{defeated}} in Terengganu, enforcement of female dress codes was reduced. The state PAS government in Kelantan bans traditional Malay dance theatres, banned advertisements depicting women who are not <b>fully</b> <b>clothed,</b> and enforced the wearing of headscarves, although they allowed gender segregated cinemas and concerts. Some government-controlled bodies pressure non-Muslims to also wear headscarves, and all students of the International Islamic University of Malaysia and female officers in the Royal Malaysian Police are required to wear headscarves in public ceremonies.|$|E
25|$|Omm Sety {{believed}} in the curative powers of water from certain holy places. She would heal herself by jumping into the sacred pool in the Osireion <b>fully</b> <b>clothed.</b> Friends report how she not only healed herself but others using this method. A baby brought to her by distraught parents because of breathing difficulties recovered after using water from the Osireion. Omm Sety reported that she no longer needed glasses, was cured of arthritis and appendicitis using {{the waters of the}} Osireion.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally the attire of the Igbo {{generally}} {{consisted of}} little clothing as {{the purpose of}} clothing then was to conceal private parts, although elders were <b>fully</b> <b>clothed.</b> Children were usually nude from birth till their adolescence (the {{time when they were}} considered to have something to hide) but sometimes ornaments such as beads were worn around the waist for medical reasons. Uli body art was also used to decorate both {{men and women in the}} form of lines forming patterns and shapes on the body.|$|E
25|$|The goddesses {{chose to}} place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice {{into the hands of}} Paris, a Trojan prince. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida where Troy was situated, the goddesses {{appeared}} before Paris for his decision. In the extant ancient depictions of the Judgement of Paris, Aphrodite is only occasionally represented nude, and Athena and Hera are always <b>fully</b> <b>clothed.</b> Since the Renaissance, however, western paintings have typically portrayed all three goddesses as completely naked.|$|E
25|$|During {{the cruise}} to Japan, Alice {{jumped into the}} ship's pool <b>fully</b> <b>clothed,</b> and coaxed Congressman Longworth to join her in the water. (Years later Bobby Kennedy would chide her about the incident, saying it was {{outrageous}} for the time, to which the by-then-octogenarian Alice replied that it would only have been outrageous had she removed her clothes.) In her autobiography, Crowded Hours, Alice made note of the event, pointing {{out that there was}} little difference between the linen skirt and blouse she had been wearing and a lady's swimsuit of the period.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, the United States Environmental Protection Agency {{declared}} {{a goal of}} making the river swimmable by 2005. In 1996, Governor William Weld plunged, <b>fully</b> <b>clothed,</b> into the river to prove his commitment to cleaning up the river. On November 12, 2004, Christopher Swain became {{the first person to}} swim the Charles River's entire length, in an effort to raise public awareness of the river's environmental health. In July 2007, the river hosted the Charles River Masters Swim Race, the first sanctioned race in the Charles in over five decades.|$|E
25|$|On {{the morning}} of May 9, 1989, Whitley awoke and spoke with his mother briefly on the phone. He was then visited by his {{brother-in-law}} Lane Palmer, and the two had coffee and they were planning a day of golf and having lunch, after which Whitley had planned to start writing songs for Lorrie Morgan and himself to record when she returned from her concert tour. Palmer departed at approximately 8:30a.m., informing Whitley {{to be ready to}} leave within an hour. Upon returning, Palmer found Whitley face down on his bed, <b>fully</b> <b>clothed.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because {{the use of}} nude female models was controversial, {{relatively}} few such drawings were made before the 17th century, when academic life classes were established. Before that boys or young men, typically studio apprentices, were used as models for figures of both sexes, as is sometimes rather apparent. Exceptions from the Italian Renaissance include Raphael, who made nude drawings, apparently of his mistress, and Lorenzo Lotto, who recorded in his account book having used women of ill repute as life models. In Florence, Michelangelo and Raphael initiated the practice of making preparatory studies of the nude prior to painting the figure <b>fully</b> <b>clothed,</b> {{in order to better}} understand the underlying structure of the body.|$|E
25|$|Over the {{following}} three years, the band toured extensively to promote the album, including concerts in the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to record Buckley's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer. In 1997, Buckley moved to Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue. On May 29, 1997, while awaiting the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim, <b>fully</b> <b>clothed,</b> in the Mississippi River when he {{was caught in the}} wake of a passing boat; his body was found on June 4.|$|E
25|$|In October 2002, Myskina had {{a series}} of photos taken for GQ {{magazine}} by the photographer Mark Seliger for a spread in the October 2002 edition of GQ, in which one approved photo of her <b>fully</b> <b>clothed</b> was published. After she won the French Open in 2004, some photographs from the shoot, in which she appeared topless, were published in the Russian magazine Medved (Bear). In August 2004, she filed an US$8 million lawsuit against GQ for allowing her topless photographs to appear in Medved without her consent. On 19 June 2005, U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, later United States Attorney General, ruled that Myskina could not stop the distribution of the topless photos, because she had signed a release. Myskina had claimed that she did not understand the photo release form and that she was not fluent in English at the time.|$|E
25|$|Richard Griffin {{was born}} August 31, 1916. He was a 29-year-old war veteran who was {{discharged}} from the Seabees in November 1945. He was a carpenter and painter and handled his own contracting. He was living with his mother, Mrs. R. H. Griffin, at 155 Robison Courts which was built for servicemen returning from World War II and has since been demolished. Griffin attended school in Linden, Texas and Union Chapel, Cass County.

500|$|In August 2005, Jack Thompson, {{an activist}} who campaigns against video games, {{demanded that the}} Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) change its rating for Killer7 from [...] "M" [...] (for Mature, ages 17 and up) to [...] "AO" [...] (for Adults Only, ages 18 and up). He cited Casamassina's review of the game at IGN, {{claiming}} that [...] "full-blown sex sequences" [...] present in the game would be harmful to minors. Casamassina rebutted that the scene in question involved two <b>fully</b> <b>clothed</b> adults and that a similar scene in a film would garner [...] "only a PG-13 or, worst, R-rating".|$|E
500|$|Perry {{thoroughly}} enjoyed {{what he was}} doing, {{saying in}} a 1989 interview, [...] "I {{got a kick out}} of live television. The spontaneity was the fun of it." [...] Spontaneity and the ability to be himself came in handy for swimmer/actress Esther Williams' guest appearance of March 16, 1957. A wardrobe malfunction meant that viewers were seeing more of Esther than 1950s television considered to be in good taste; more live show mishaps followed. At the show's end, Williams was swimming in a pool specially constructed on the set for her appearance. Como simply said, [...] "Goodnight, folks," [...] and leaped, <b>fully</b> <b>clothed,</b> into the swimming pool.|$|E

David Yeates said that the family [...] "had been told to prepare for the worst" [...] and expressed relief that his daughter's body had been recovered. Funeral arrangements were delayed as investigators retained the body. The pathologist Dr Nat Carey consented to the release of the body on 31 January 2011.|$|E
500|$|Dahl and Meier won a local Emmy {{award for}} a {{television}} special {{they did in}} 1981 called, Greetings from Graceland, which was a comedy spoof on the tourist shrine and featured Elvis Presley's [...] "Uncle Vester" [...] selling Elvis cookbooks from the guardhouse. [...] They briefly had a morning television show, called It's Too Early on local Chicago station, WFBN-TV, which nationally syndicated columnist Bob Greene called [...] "the best program on television", [...] "amazing", and [...] "hypnotic" [...] in his June 20, 1983 column.
