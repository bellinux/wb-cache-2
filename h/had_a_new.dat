5|$|An {{adaptation}} of the comics was originally envisioned by producer Tonino Cervi.

The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.|$|E
5|$|By 1912, the Cardiff Football Ground, as it {{was then}} known, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> south stand and {{temporary}} stands on the north, east and west ends of the ground.
