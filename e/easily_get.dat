5|$|The rook is {{then used}} to support a piece attack against White's castled King. Black can <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The queen's arrival on the h4-square is {{facilitated}} {{by the absence of}} a white knight on the f3-square (that would otherwise cover the h4-square) and of a black knight on the f6-square (that would block the way for the black queen). If White tries to defend with h2–h3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file.|$|E
5|$|The move 4.Nf3 {{develops}} a piece and covers the sensitive d2-square. After 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2Nc6 6.a3 Black can <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> {{confused by the}} move-order. The natural 6...Nxd2 7.Bxd2 Bxd2+ 8.Qxd2 Qe7 9.Qc3 transposes {{in the same position}} as after 5.Bd2, but White can also try 6...Nxd2 7.axb4! Nxf3+ 8.gxf3 Nxe5 9.Rg1 Qe7 10.Ra3! with a strong initiative. White can even retain his bishop with 6...Nxd2 7.Nxd2 and now Borik recommends 7...Bf8 with difficult play for Black as he is not certain to gain his pawn back. To avoid these possibilities Lalic advises the move-order 6...Bxd2+ 7.Bxd2 Nxd2 8.Qxd2 Qe7, but does not mention the possibility of White answering 6...Bxd2+ with 7.Nxd2. A possible improvement for Black (after 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2) would be 5...d5 with compensation for the pawn in all lines.|$|E
5|$|Mason {{had long}} battled against Alexandria merchants who he felt unfairly {{dominated}} the county court, {{if only because}} they could more <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> to the courthouse. In 1789, he drafted legislation to move the courthouse {{to the center of}} the county, though it did not pass in his lifetime. In 1798, the legislature passed an authorizing act, and the courthouse opened in 1801. Most of those at Gunston Hall, both family and slaves, fell ill during the summer of 1792, experiencing chills and fever; when those subsided, Mason caught a chest cold. When Jefferson visited Gunston Hall on October 1, 1792, he found Mason, long a martyr to gout, needing a crutch to walk, though still sound in mind and memory. Additional ailments, possibly pneumonia, set in. Less than a week after Jefferson's visit, on October 7, George Mason died at Gunston Hall, and was subsequently buried on the estate, within sight of the house he had built and of the Potomac River.|$|E

For example, if many do well in a paper, there is a potential reduction of the raw score and vice versa, despite differences in performances each year. For example, an average student would get a score of 210+ if he/she scored 3 low As and a high B. A highly proficient student would <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> a score of 250 and above if they scored 2 or 3 A*s and high As.|$|E

25|$|For Major League baseball, the Metrodome {{was widely}} {{thought of as}} a hitter's park, with a low (7ft) left-field fence (343ft) that favored {{right-handed}} power hitters, and the higher (23ft) but closer (327ft) right-field Baggie that favored left-handed power hitters. Because the roof is very nearly the same color as a baseball, and transmits light, the Metrodome had a far higher error incidence than a normal stadium during day games, so instead of losing a fly ball in the sun, as is common for non-roofed stadiums, fly balls could <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> lost in the ceiling. Unlike most parks built during this time, Metrodome's baseball configuration had asymmetrical outfield dimensions.|$|E
25|$|The {{surface of}} the Earth is a {{rotating}} reference frame. To solve classical mechanics problems exactly in an Earth-bound reference frame, three fictitious forces must be introduced: the Coriolis force, the centrifugal force (described below) and the Euler force. The Euler force is typically ignored because the variations in the angular velocity of the rotating Earth surface are usually insignificant. Both of the other fictitious forces are weak compared to most typical forces in everyday life, {{but they can be}} detected under careful conditions. For example, Léon Foucault was able to show that the Coriolis force results from the Earth's rotation using the Foucault pendulum. If the Earth were to maintain its current shape but rotate twenty times faster (making each day only ~72 minutes long), people could <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> the impression that such fictitious forces were pulling on them, as on a spinning carousel--those in temperate and tropical latitudes would, in fact, need to hold on in order to avoid being launched into orbit by the centrifugal force.|$|E
25|$|The campus {{bus system}} was {{established}} in 1969 as the Student Senate Transit Services (now UMass Transit). In 1973, a demonstration grant secured money {{to set up a}} fare-free transit system. This, coupled with increased parking fees and strict parking regulations, was used to alleviate vehicular congestion and parking problems on campus. In 1976, the University of Massachusetts Transit Services became a contractor for PVTA. UMass Transit (UMTS) introduced an honor-based system in which any potential rider (not including students with valid UCards) during certain reduced service periods times of the year (or PVTA employees at any time of year) is expected to possess a ticket purchased locally in Amherst that grants either single or multiple rides, or a days or weeks pass purchased in Amherst or from a Springfield or Northampton bus. UMTS is a contractor for the PVTA, and runs its Amherst routes from a garage based on campus. It serves not only the University of Massachusetts campus, but also the surrounding colleges and communities. This bus system is run primarily by University students, and is free for students, which allows them to <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> to classes at the other four colleges.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{gave the}} film an {{overwhelmingly}} positive response, {{in particular the}} ensemble cast's performance and credibility. Although The Indian Express spoke positively of the cinematography and the film's story, it noted that [...] "the message that the film carries with it tends to get diluted towards the climax. Praising the film's cast for their performance and the cinematography of Binod Pradhan, Taran Ardash wrote that the film would be successful with the urban audiences. The Hindustan Times summarized the film as being a [...] "well-scripted, skilfully crafted [...] thought-provoking entertainer". Saisuresh Sivaswamy of Rediff.com wrote that films like Rang De Basanti can <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> into [...] "preachiness", but believed Mehra got his message across while avoiding this, also appreciating the music, cinematography, dialogues and art direction. The Hindu credited Kamlesh Pandey for writing a story {{that would have been}} a difficult film to make, but it added by saying that the transformation of the youngsters into heroes seemed poetic. Although the screenplay, direction and the cast were also well-appreciated, the reviewer felt that Rahman's soundtrack lacked pace.|$|E
500|$|Approximately 35micrograms of {{beryllium}} {{is found}} in the average human body, an amount not considered harmful. Beryllium is chemically similar to magnesium and therefore can displace it from enzymes, which causes them to malfunction. Because Be2+ is a highly charged and small ion, it can <b>easily</b> <b>get</b> into many tissues and cells, where it specifically targets cell nuclei, inhibiting many enzymes, including those used for synthesizing DNA. Its toxicity is exacerbated {{by the fact that the}} body has no means to control beryllium levels, and once inside the body the beryllium cannot be removed. Chronic berylliosis is a pulmonary and systemic granulomatous disease caused by inhalation of dust or fumes contaminated with beryllium; either large amounts over a short time or small amounts over a long time can lead to this ailment. Symptoms of the disease can take up to five years to develop; about a third of patients with it die and the survivors are left disabled. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) lists beryllium and beryllium compounds as Category 1 carcinogens. In the US, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has designated a permissible exposure limit (PEL) in the workplace with a time-weighted average (TWA) 0.002mg/m3 [...] and a constant exposure limit of 0.005mg/m3 over 30 minutes, with a maximum peak limit of 0.025mg/m3. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of constant 0.0005mg/m3. The IDLH (immediately dangerous to life and health) value is 4mg/m3.|$|E
