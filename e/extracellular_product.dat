50|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of BPF is {{not well}} established but {{it is thought that}} patients become pharyngeal or conjunctival carriers of H. aegyptius, which is followed by spreading to the bloodstream. This hypothesis is supported by the isolation of from both the conjunctiva and oropharynx of documented BPF cases with H. aegyptius bacteremia. Possible virulence factors of H. aegyptius include lipooligosaccharides (LOS), capsular polysaccharides, pilus proteins (mediates adhesion to mucosal membrane), immunoglobulin A1 (IgA1), membrane associated proteins, and extracellular proteins. In a study conducted by Barbosa et al., a 60 kilodalton hemagglutinating <b>extracellular</b> <b>product</b> was suggested to be the major pathogenic factor linked to the hemorrhagic manifestations of BPF. This molecule was found to be absorbable by human O-type erythrocytes. After the molecule had been injected into rabbits, they showed reactions similar to that of BPF patients. Further research is being conducted to determine the mechanisms involved with the other virulence factors of H. aegyptius. The overall pathogenesis of BPF probably involves multiple steps and a number of bacterial factors.|$|E

We describe the effects of different translation initiation rates on the dynamic range of a p-coumaric acid biosensor based on the Bacillus subtilis transcriptional repressor PadR by varying its ribosomal binding site.

The streptococcal antigen utilized {{in these studies}} was first purified on SDS gels and then eluted from the gel, resulting in a single protein band on SDS electrophoresis. Double diffusion studies revealed that only nephritis patients reacted to this <b>extracellular</b> <b>product</b> associated with nephritogenic strains, whereas rheumatic fever sera produced no line of precipitation. An assay of serial bleedings from nephritis patients suggested that the antibody reactive to the NASP was in higher titre in the acute phase {{of the disease and}} decreased with convalescence.

A striking increase was detected in the reactivity of nephritis patients (96 %) compared to non-nephritis sera (15 - 20 %). Comparison between acute and convalescent sera using this technique confirmed the finding of decreasing antibody titre with resolution of disease.

40|$|The enteric {{microflora}} {{represents one}} of the densest microbial populations in the biological world; as a consequence, the intestinal immune system is constantly exposed to high concentrations of antigenic materials. One of the major frontline defences in the innate immune system is the intestinal epithelial layer, which presents both a physical barrier and an immune sensor to the antigens of the lumen. The latter function is performed by the expression of pattern recognition receptors, which recognise a wide variety of bacterial antigens, and the production of inflammatory cytokines, which stimulate, or inhibit, inflammation. The overall aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the immunomodulatory potential of <b>extracellular</b> <b>products,</b> from non-pathogenic bacteria, with intestinal epithelial cells. Two in vitro human intestinal epithelial cell lines HT 29 - 19 A and Caco- 2 were shown to exhibit different expression levels of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL) - 8 and IL- 10. These differences were reflected in their sensitivity (monitored by IL- 8 release) to known TLR agonists, isolated from pathogenic bacteria. Caco- 2 cells were also shown to form physiologically active tight junctions, with the formation and maintenance of domes. Both cell lines exhibited sensitivity to the cytotoxic <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> of the enteropathogen Clostridium difficile. <b>Extracellular</b> <b>products,</b> in crude cell-free supernatants and bacterial sonicates, from the commensal Gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli C 25, significantly increased IL- 8 release in both cell lines. Lipopolysaccharides and membrane vesicles were shown to contribute to the proinflammatory effects of C 25 -derived <b>extracellular</b> <b>products.</b> These <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> were also shown to regulate bacterial internalisation in both cell lines. Crude cell free supernatants and bacterial sonicates from two lactobacilli strains Lactobacillus acidophilus 5 e 2 and Lactobacillus helveticus sp. Rosyjski were also found to be biologically active, stimulating IL- 8 release and TLR expression modification in both intestinal epithelial cell lines. In addition, ultrapure EPSs, isolated from these lactobacilli strains, were also found to possess immunomodulatory potential. HT 29 - 19 A cells, pre-treated with EPSs, were found to be ‘primed’ to bacterial agonists, peptidoglycan and flagellin, with a significantly potentiated release in IL- 8 observed. Finally, EPSs were also found to modify bacterial adherence and internalisation in both cell lines. In conclusion, data presented in this investigation has shown that the use of the intestinal epithelial cell lines, HT 29 - 19 A and Caco- 2, presents a reasonable model for investigating the interaction of bacterial <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> with the intestinal epithelium. Additionally, it has demonstrated that <b>extracellular</b> <b>products,</b> isolated from non pathogenic, enteric-associated bacteria, possess immunomodulatory potential in vitro. If these effects were also to occur in vivo, then they could potentially contribute to intestinal homeostasis and the innate ‘priming’ of the epithelial layer to pathogens and their products...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} the iron content of the medium on the yields of <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> by seven {{distinct}} strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was examined. All strains showed at least an 85 % decrease in toxin A yields when grown in medium containing 5. 0 μg of iron per ml (high iron) as compared to 0. 05 μg/ml (low iron), whereas bacterial growth increased approximately twofold. During the course of examining <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> produced by P. aeruginosa, we found many strains that produced an extracellular factor which agglutinated erythrocytes. This hemagglutinin was nondialyzable, heat stable, and resistant to Pronase and trypsin. The effect of iron on extracellular yields of hemagglutinin was strain dependent; four of seven strains showed decreases in hemagglutinin yields in high-iron medium. Similarly, the effect of increasing the iron concentration of the growth medium on yields of total extracellular proteases or on elastase was strain dependent. The amount of total extracellular protein was decreased by at least 31 % in the high-iron medium for all strains of P. aeruginosa examined. Detailed studies on one strain (WR- 9) showed that, {{in the presence of}} increasing amounts of iron in the medium, the extracellular yields of toxin A, protease, and hemagglutinin were decreased in a similar manner. In addition, the kinetics of release of these <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> were similar at a given iron concentration.

In this study, we demonstrate that <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> of a commensal bacterium, Escherichia coli C 25, elicit a moderate release of proinflammatory IL- 8 and stimulate transcriptional up-regulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in intestinal epithelial cell lines, HT 29 - 19 A and Caco- 2.

40|$|Abstract Salt {{stress is}} one of the most serious factors {{limiting}} the productivity of rice, the staple diet in many countries. Gibberellic acid has been reported to reduce NaCl-induced growth inhibition in some plants including rice. Most paddy soils have a natural population of Cyanobacteria, prokaryotic photosynthethic microorganisms, which synthesize and liberate plant growth regulators such as gibberellins that could exert a natural beneficial effect on salt stressed rice plants. The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of the cyanobacterium Scytonema hofmanni <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> on the growth of rice seedlings inhibited by NaCl and to compare it with the effect of the gibberellic acid in the same stress condition. Growth (length and weight of the seedlings) and biochemical parameters (5 -aminolevulinate dehydratase activity, total free porphyrin and pigments content) were evaluated. Salt exposure negatively affected all parameters measured, with the exception of chlorophyll. Chlrorophyll concentrations nearly doubled upon exposure to high salt. Gibberellic acid counteracted the effect of salt on the length and dry weight of the shoot, and on carotenoid and chlorophyll b contents. <b>Extracellular</b> <b>products</b> nullified the salt effect on shoot dry weight and carotenoid content; partially counteracted the effect on shoot length (from 54 % to 38 % decrease), root dry weight (from 59 % to 41 % decrease) and total free porphyrin (from 31 to 13 % decrease); reduced by 35 % the salt increase of chlorophyll a; had no effect on root length and chlorophyll b. Gibberellic acid and <b>extracellular</b> <b>products</b> increased 5 -aminolevulinate dehydratase activity over the control without salt. When coincident with high salinity, exposure to either EP or GA 3, resulted in a reversal of shoot-related responses to salt stress.

Experiments with a diffusion chamber and attempts to precipitate a postulated enzyme from the culture of these strains by ammonium sulfate suggest that this action is due to an <b>extracellular</b> <b>product</b> of the bacteria. The meaning of these data in the physiopathology of rheumatic cardiac lesions is briefly discussed...|$|E
40|$|During growth group A streptococci {{elaborate}} {{a variety}} of products which can be identified in the supernatant broth by their respective biological activities. Among the better known of these extracellular products are the erythrogenic toxins, streptolysins O and S, streptokinase, and streptococcal hyaluronidase, desoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, proteinase, amylase, and diphosphopyridine nucleotidase (1, 2). Investigation of the individual properties of these products and of their possible significance in the pathogenesis of streptococcal diseases and their complications has been hampered {{by the nature of}} the preparations available for study. Crude concentrates of the extracellular products contain a mixture of the known streptococcal enzymes) additional streptococcal substances of uncertain nature, and considerable amounts of constituents from the growth medium. Although some of the extracellular substances have been obtained in a more purified state, only streptococcal proteinase and its precursor have been crystallized (3). In the present investigation, concentrates of the <b>extracellular</b> <b>product...</b>|$|E

The bacteria spreads via infected phagocytes, mainly macrophages. This spread can be rapid, and lethal effects may occur {{within a few days}} of challenge, affecting tissues containing large numbers of the pathogens (Evelyn, 1996).|$|R
