40|$|Based {{on current}} {{models of the}} Cosmic X-ray Background (CXB), heavily {{obscured}} Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are expected to make up ~ 10 % of the peak emission of the CXB and ~ 20 % {{of the total population}} of AGN, yet few of these sources have been recorded and characterized in current surveys. Here we present the Chandra follow-up observation of 14 AGN detected by Swift-BAT. For five sources in the sample, NuSTAR observations in the 3 - 80 keV band are also available. The X-ray spectral fitting over the 0. 3 - 150 keV energy range allows us to determine the main X-ray spectral parameters, such as the photon index and the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption,</b> of these objects, and to make hypotheses on the physical structures responsible for the observed spectra.

These quasars cover a redshift range of z = 0. 11 - 5. 41 and a magnitude range of i = 15. 3 - 20. 7. Substantial numbers of radio-loud (70) and broad absorption line (51) quasars exist within this sample. Significant X-ray detections at ≥ 2 σ account for 87 % of the sample (685 quasars), and 473 quasars are detected at ≥ 6 σ, sufficient to allow X-ray spectral fits. For detected sources, ∼ 60 % have X-ray fluxes between F 2 − 10 keV = 1 - 10 x 10 − 14 ergs cm − 2 s − 1. We fit a single power-law, a fixed power-law with <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> left free to vary, and an absorbed power-law model to all quasars with X-ray S/N ≥ 6, resulting in a weighted mean photon index Γ = 1. 91 ± 0. 08, with an intrinsic dispersion σΓ = 0. 38. For the 55 sources (11. 6 %) that prefer <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption,</b> we find a weighted mean NH = 1. 5 ± 0. 3 x 10 21 cm − 2.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is the study of}} the optical {{properties}} of InP quantum dots (QDs) and the exploration of a new method for the synthesis of InP/CdS core-shell QDs. A multitude of research on colloidal QDs requires detailed knowledge of the relation between optical and structural properties, namely the sizing curve, the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient and the molar extinction coefficient. In this work, InP QDs were synthesized and structurally and optically characterized. The sizing curve was established from the average QD diameter, obtained by transmission electron microscopy, and the position of the first excitonic <b>absorption</b> peak. The <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient and molar extinction coefficient were determined from quantitative elemental analysis and the absorbance of the nanocrystals at short wavelengths. We found that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> coefficient is size-independent in this wavelength region and the molar extinction coefficient increases linearly with the QD volume. The focus of our study was then shifted to the fabrication of core-shell QD heterostructures, based on a recently reported method that used a more sustainable and much cheaper phosphorus precursor for the synthesis of high-quality InP/ZnS QDs. Using this procedure, we synthesized highly luminescent InP/CdS QDs and their emission could be tuned in the visible and near-infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, time-resolved photoluminescence measurements were performed on samples of InP/ZnS and InP/CdS QDs. We also report an exploratory study on the mechanism of formation of InP QDs with this new method. A thorough understanding of the reaction mechanism will enable a better control over the synthesis products and is potentially relevant for the fabrication of QDs consisting of other III-V semiconductors (e. g.

We present an analysis of the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> lines in the high-resolution (∼ 7 km/s) far-UV spectrum which was obtained from observations with the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The spectrum spans wavelengths from 1150 Å to 1710 Å, and shows strong emission lines from O VI and Lyα. Associated absorption lines are present on the blue wings of the high-ionization emission doublets O VI λλ 1032, 1038 and N V λλ 1238, 1242, as well as the Lyman lines through Lyϵ. These <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> features are resolved into several distinct kinematic components, covering rest-frame velocities from - 40 to - 2800 km/s, with respect to the systemic redshift of z_em= 0. 3721.

For 76 (85 %) of these sources we have spectroscopic or photometric redshifts, and therefore {{we are able to}} derive their intrinsic properties from X-ray spectral analysis, namely <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> and total X-ray luminosities. We find that the population of submillijansky radio sources with X-ray counterparts is composed of a mix of roughly 1 / 3 star forming galaxies and 2 / 3 AGN. The distribution of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> among X-ray detected radio sources is {{different from that of the}} X-ray selected sample. Namely, the fraction of low absorption sources is at least two times larger than that of X-ray selected sources in the CDFS. This is mostly due to the larger fraction of star forming galaxies present among the X-ray detected radio sources. If we investigate the distribution of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>absorption</b> among sources with L_X> 10 ^ 42 erg s^- 1 in the hard 2 - 10 keV band (therefore in the AGN luminosity regime), we find agreement between the X-ray population with and without radio emission.
