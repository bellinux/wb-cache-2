25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been stashed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his topcoat. Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, {{the object is}} found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp metal fitting that can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E

He also confesses that he killed the Pope with an overdose of heparin, a powerful anticoagulant because the Pope revealed he had fathered a child.|$|E

She takes off a shoe and leaves it at the river side, and then hides in the bush. Mu Renzhi and his men find the shoe and assume that Xi'er has drowned herself in the river, and they report to the landlord as such.|$|E
25|$|Wooden cages made of tiny {{rods and}} planks were once {{the most common}} type of insect house. The people of Shanghai and Hangzhou areas still use stool-shaped cages for keeping captive grasshoppers. Elsewhere, cages were {{historically}} used for keeping captive cicadas. They were suspended outdoors, at the eaves of the houses and from tree branches. Their use declined when the Chinese concentrated on keeping crickets. Small cages are still used for transporting crickets. Some are curved to follow the shape of a human body; crickets need warmth and prefer to be kept close to the body. The cage is placed in a tao, a kind of protective silk bag, and is ideally carried <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> a shirt. A special type of funnel-shaped wire mesh cage is used to temporarily contain the cricket while its main home is being cleaned.|$|E
25|$|On 6 July, it was {{reported}} widely that the Cambridge store of Boots and also the Edinburgh Woolen Mill in {{the centre of the}} city had caught on fire. The Boots branch burnt for four hours completely destroying the building and the wool clothing store was badly damaged with the entire stock ruined. Two more devices were then found, both leather shops, one of which was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> a sheepskin coat. The ARM claimed all four devices, causing Cambridge city centre to be cordoned off whilst officers searched for two more devices that the cell claimed would explode the following day at 12pm. After an extensive search, it was concluded that the additional two devices claimed were a hoax, with no further devices exploding the following day. A month later, another leather shop was destroyed and the same wool mill suffered minor damage after devices went off, with two more recovered in leather shops and one in a fur shop.|$|E

25|$|Hutchinson {{made another}} {{movement}} on the 21st and invested the town of Giza with the Anglo Ottoman force encamped close to the French advanced works {{on the other side}} of the river. By this time the force besieging Cairo had swelled to 20,000 men. An important letter had been found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> a French General named Roiz who was killed in the action on the 21st written by Menou expressing an apprehension that the British would cut the embankment which formed the canal of Alexandria and thereby to let the waters of the sea into Lake Mariout cutting off any chance of escape for the French. This was subsequently done by the engineers and water rushed in flooding the area and making the canal unusable and making the French with no escape route whatsoever. Some slight skirmishing took place in the evening on both banks of the Nile wherein the Mamelukes forced back a French sortie. On the 22nd preparations were made to besiege Cairo and its different forts by the allied forces.|$|E
25|$|With the Bolshevik victory, Swenson {{found not}} just two schooners but his entire Siberian {{business}} and stock impounded and a warrant {{out for his}} arrest. The issues besides alcohol (if that was really an issue) were taxes and his perceived close association with the Whites. He briefly discusses allegations of selling guns to the Whites, suggesting they were inflated, and attributes some allegations to disgruntled competitors. (Hunting arms and ammunition were {{a regular part of}} his business.) He does not mention an allegation of a check for $500,000 found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> an executed White officer. Swenson reports he declined an offer from a former White officer to raid the coast and recover the furs by force. Instead he and R.S. Pollister (Vice President of Olaf Swenson & Co.) went to China to obtain a Soviet visa and began a long slow process of negotiation to release the furs, trading stock, and books. The ultimate resolution was a contract entered in 1925 to deliver goods in Siberia to Moscow's specification on a cost-plus basis and export furs. This contract was renewed for five years in 1926 and expanded in 1928 after negotiations {{with the head of the}} Soviet fur trust in London. Other associates in this venture were Maurice Cantor and Irving W. Herskovits of New York. In this period, the business name often appears as Swenson Trading Company or Swenson Fur Trading Company. Local trade was handled by a Soviet government trading organization which specified the goods and set fur prices. Swenson reports prices paid to the trappers were reduced in this period and the range of trade goods narrowed to necessities.|$|E

The letter was never officially made public, but was leaked in November 1990 to Francine Pelletier, and {{published}} in the newspaper La Presse. In his suicide letter, Lépine claimed political motives, blaming feminists for ruining his life. He considered himself rational and expressed admiration for Denis Lortie, who had mounted {{an attack on the}} Quebec National Assembly in 1984 for political reasons, killing three Quebec government employees. The letter also contained a list of nineteen Quebec women whom Lépine apparently wished to kill because of their feminism. [...] Another letter, written to a friend, promised the explanation to the massacre lay by following clues left in Lépine's apartment. The hunt led only to a suitcase of computer games and hardware.|$|E

500|$|Crispy Gamer {{was created}} by Chris Heldman, head of media {{entertainment}} at Google; John Keefer, editorial director of GameSpy; Chris Hoerenz, chief marketing officer from eMusic; E2open engineer Andre Srinivasan; and Aldis Porietis. The website was first conceived by Chris Heldman under the idea of [...] "The Game Trust", a chosen group {{of some of the}} finest writers in the industry. He pitched the idea of creating a new gaming website to John Keefer at the E3 2007. Keefer, initially adamant, agreed with the stipulation of a [...] "separation of church and state" [...] in terms of being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> video game companies. The company was based in New York City, setting up office in October 2007. The site was in beta for six months before launching on October 26, 2008, with twenty employees, ranging from Entertainment Weekly to Wired. The website announced the same day that it raised $8.25 million in venture capital from J. P. Morgan's Constellation Ventures. In February 2009, Crispy Gamer signed a syndication deal with Tribune Media Services, McClatchy Tribune Information Services, and gamerDNA.|$|E
500|$|At Stonehenge, the Doctor, Amy, and River find {{a passage}} to an {{underground}} area. Inside, {{they find the}} Pandorica, a giant metal box outfitted with every type of lock imaginable. While examining the Pandorica, Amy confronts the Doctor about an engagement ring she had previously found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> his jacket and feels a strong emotional attachment to; he says that it belonged to a [...] "friend", and that nothing is ever truly forgotten. The Pandorica is transmitting a signal amplified by Stonehenge's rocks across the universe, and River warns the Doctor that the signal is drawing [...] "everything that ever hated [...] " [...] to Earth that night. The Doctor is aided by a volunteer group of Roman legionaries; the centurion in charge of them is revealed to be Amy's fiancé, Rory. Neither Rory nor the Doctor can explain Rory's presence, as he was consumed by {{a crack in the}} universe during the events of [...] "Cold Blood" [...] and erased from existence. When Amy comes around after being knocked out by a damaged Cyberman, she does not remember Rory, which upsets him greatly. The Doctor assures Rory that Amy will remember in time, and hands him the engagement ring.|$|E
500|$|McLaren's {{domination}} continued throughout , and the Prost-Senna {{struggle for}} supremacy {{put them on}} a collision course. Mutual admiration turned to all-out hatred, with the Frenchman accusing his Brazilian teammate of [...] "dangerous driving" [...] and of receiving more than a fair share of attention from both McLaren and Honda. For his part, Senna accused Prost of being <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> <b>of</b> FISA's French president Jean-Marie Balestre. The animosity between the two drivers came to a head at Round 2 in San Marino. The drivers made an agreement between them that whoever won the start would not be challenged by the other going into the first turn (in this case, the Tosa bend on the Imola circuit). Prost kept to the agreement after Senna won the first start. Prost however won the restart (caused by Gerhard Berger's fiery crash in his Ferrari), but was passed by Senna under brakes for Tosa. Prost went to a friend of his, a French journalist, and told him about the broken agreement between him and Senna. Against Prost's wishes, the journalist went public with the story. During testing at Pembrey in Wales, Senna denied in public any such agreement had ever existed between himself and Prost, but the Frenchman's claim was backed up by Marlboro's John Hogan who had been present when the agreement was made.|$|E
