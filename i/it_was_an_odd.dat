Bowerman wrote that he was certain Prefontaine would become the world's {{greatest}} distance runner if he decided to run at Oregon. Although <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> promise, Prefontaine was up for the challenge. Sometime after Prefontaine announced that he signed a letter of intent to attend the University of Oregon on the first of May in 1969, Bowerman wrote a letter addressed to the community of Coos Bay describing his appreciation for their role in helping Steve become a great runner.|$|E
500|$|Jason Newman of Rap-Up {{began his}} review, [...] "For a singer long {{accustomed}} to stadiums, Sunday's show {{was the most}} intimate performance most fans would see from the ubiquitous superstar." [...] He highlighted how she [...] "split the difference between hushed torch singer and stadium belter", and favored her ability to display both [...] "stamina and vigor, which make for a stadium-perfect show". Newman concluded, [...] "The medley combined the quick blasts of a Las Vegas revue with the emotional candor of a singer-songwriter performing to a near-empty room. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd,</b> yet effective juxtaposition; a global superstar who could effortlessly shuffle between slick, bombastic R and awkwardly honest confessions of a tumultuous career. By {{the end of the}} set though, humility, as one expects from a singer with 16 Grammy awards and more than 75 million records sold worldwide, turned to sly confidence." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times was impressed by the show, complimenting Beyoncé's performances of [...] "underdog tracks" [...] such as [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "Love on Top".

500|$|The {{first issue}} of Fantastic was impressive, with a cover that sf {{historian}} Mike Ashley has described as [...] "one of the most captivating of all first issues"; the painting, by Barye Phillips and Leo Summers, illustrated Kris Neville's [...] "The Opal Necklace". [...] The fiction included some stories by well known names; in particular, Raymond Chandler's [...] "Professor Bingo's Snuff" [...] would have caught readers' eyes—the story had appeared the year before in Park East magazine, but would have been new to most readers. [...] It was a short mystery in which the fantasy element was invisibility, achieved by magical snuff. [...] Isaac Asimov and Ray Bradbury also contributed stories, and the issue led with [...] "Six and Ten Are Johnny", by Walter M. Miller. [...] The rear cover reprinted Pierre Roy's painting [...] "Danger on the Stairs", which depicted a snake on a staircase; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> choice, but subsequent back covers were more natural fits for a fantasy magazine. [...] The quality of the fiction continued to be high for the first year; sf historian Mike Ashley comments that almost every story in the first seven issues was of high quality, and historian David Kyle regards it as an [...] "outstandingly successful experiment". Science fiction bibliographer Donald Tuck dissents, however, regarding {{the first few years}} as containing [...] "little of note", and James Blish wrote a contemporary review of the second issue which found it lacking: Blish dismissed three of the seven stories in the Fall 1952 issue as being essentially crime stories written for the sf market, and commented that of the remaining four, only two were [...] "reasonably competent and craftsmanlike".|$|E

2500|$|Built in 1955 as a foyer {{area of the}} {{restaurant}} block, becoming a store area, converted to a studio in 1996 for Children's BBC.

It opened onto the Blue Peter Garden allowing presentation to take place there. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> <b>odd</b> shape, and was used for invision continuity for CBBC until 2004, when they broadcast links for the CBBC Channel only.
