5|$|Discerning {{dynamical}} <b>families</b> {{within the}} Jupiter trojan population {{is more difficult}} {{than it is in}} the asteroid belt, because the Jupiter trojans are locked within a far narrower range of possible positions. This means that clusters tend to overlap and merge with the overall swarm. By 2003 roughly a dozen dynamical <b>families</b> were identified. Jupiter-trojan <b>families</b> are much smaller in size than <b>families</b> in the asteroid belt; the largest identified family, the Menelaus group, consists of only eight members.|$|E
5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four <b>families</b> of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five <b>families</b> of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 <b>families</b> of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among <b>families</b> of frogs are still debated.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to empirically explore the determinants of <b>family</b> harmony in small and medium-sized <b>family</b> farms. Data from 244 questionnaires from 36 <b>family</b> farms were collected and analysed.

The impact of the existence of <b>family</b> forums and conflict management on <b>family</b> harmony was examined by means of multiple linear regression analysis. The results indicate that a significant proportion of the variation in <b>family</b> harmony among <b>family</b> members in <b>family</b> farms is explained by the existence of <b>family</b> forums and the management of conflict among <b>family</b> members.
