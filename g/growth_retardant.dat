40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} influence of single foliar flurprimidol treatment on morphology and transpiration of ‘Roman’ and ‘Freedom Red’ poinsettias. The <b>growth</b> <b>retardant</b> flurprimidol (Topflor 015 SL) was applied once as a foliar spray at concentrations of 5, 10 or 15 mg × dm- 3 when lateral shoots were about 5 cm in length. Single foliar flurprimidol treatment was sufficient to inhibit stem elongation of both poinsettia cultivars. The degree of growth inhibition depended on cultivar and <b>growth</b> <b>retardant</b> concentration. As compared to the control, the shoots of flurprimidol treated ‘Roman’ and ‘Freedom Red’ plants were up to 44 % and 37 % shorter, respectively. The desirable plant heights for ‘Roman’ and ‘Freedom Red’ poinsettias were obtained with flurprimidol at concentrations of 5 and 10 mg × dm- 3, respectively. The shoots of flurprimidol sprayed poinsettia were also more rigid and aligned relative {{to each other and}} thus the bracts on the plant were placed on the same level. The diameters of <b>growth</b> <b>retardant</b> treated poinsettias were up to 13 % narrower. The leaf areas, petiole lengths, fresh and dry weights of ‘Roman’ and ‘Freedom Red’ poinsettias treated with flurprimidol were substantially smaller as compared to the control. The bract diameters of both poinsettia cultivars were only slightly affected by <b>growth</b> <b>retardant</b> application. Plants exposed to flurprimidol had also intensified green leaf pigmentation. There was almost no abscission of the oldest leaves in the low portions of <b>growth</b> <b>retardant</b> treated plants, compared to those of the control ones.

The levels of phytohormone-like substances in the root and in the various shoot tissues were analyzed by immunoassay. After seed treatment with both compounds, shoot growth was reduced more intensively than root growth. Both compounds decreased, on a fresh weight basis, the amount of various immunoreactive gibberellins {{when compared with the}} levels in control plants, especially in the shoot tip. Likewise, the <b>growth</b> <b>retardants</b> lowered the levels of abscisic acid-like material, particularly in the primary leaf, the epicotyl and the root. In contrast, the levels of trans-zeatin-riboside and dihydrozeatin-riboside-type cytokinins were considerably elevated by the <b>growth</b> <b>retardants,</b> mainly in the primary leaf, epicotyl, and hypocotyl. On the other hand the level of isopentenyladenosine-like material was less influenced. In general, the immunoreactive 3 -indoleacetic acid content in the different plant parts was changed only slightly. It is assumed that besides their effect on gibberellin content both compounds interfere directly or indirectly with the regulation of the endogenous levels of abscisic acid and cytokinins.

40|$|Controlling plant size {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} aspects of greenhouse crop production. Growers can control crop height genetically, environmentally, culturally, or chemically. Genetic control of plant height is primarily achieved by selecting shorter cultivars. Environmental control involves manipulating light (increasing light intensity, minimizing far-red light, and photoperiod) or temperature (reducing the difference between the day and night temperatures, or DIF). Cultural control includes moisture management (stress) and phosphorus or nitrogen deprivation. These techniques can be effective height-suppressing strategies for some crops, but when growers are faced with greenhouses containing large varieties of genera, species, or cultivars, these techniques may not work equally well for each crop under a common environment. An alternative, effective strategy for controlling plant height is to use chemical plant <b>growth</b> <b>retardants</b> (PGRs). Plant <b>growth</b> <b>retardants</b> are an incredibly useful tool.

Quaternary ammonium compounds (chlormequat chloride, mepiquat chloride, Amo- 1618), triazoles (uniconazole and several experimental compounds), and the norbornanodiazetine tetcyclacis inhibited GA biosynthesis in both fungal species. Concentrations between 2 × 10 − 4 and 10 − 9 m were required for a 50 % inhibition of the production of gibberellin A 3 in Gibberella fujikuroi and of giberellin A 4 in Sphaceloma manihoticola.

Compared to the <b>growth</b> <b>retardants</b> mentioned above, the biological activity of chlorphonium chloride was low. The acylcyclohexanediones prohexadione and LAB 198 999 had virtually no activity. Most likely, this lack of activity is due to a rapid metabolism of the compounds in the cultures. For the triazole-type compounds and tetcyclacis, a relatively distinct correlation exists in their ability to inhibit GA formation in fungal cultures, to block ent-kaurene oxygenase in a cell-free system, and to reduce shoot growth of rice seedlings.
