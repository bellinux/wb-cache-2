50|$|The 180MW Francis turbine-generator {{running at}} full speed was instantaneously stopped by a foreign body left in the {{penstock}} following maintenance.

After initial consternation regarding the integrity of the wall (declared safe after lengthy assessment), the <b>hydro</b> <b>installation</b> was repaired/replaced but was off-line for several years. A breach of the wall would have obliterated only a couple of small towns and a sparsely settled agricultural area in the relatively narrow 120km Mitta Mitta valley below the dam, but more significantly, would have resulted in the over-topping and probable failure of the earthen walls of the 40m high 3,038GL Lake Hume, 200km downstream on the Murray River. This is immediately upstream of the regional cities of Albury and Wodonga and a much more intensively settled irrigation area, and consequences would have been disastrous.|$|E

30|$|It {{shows that}} wind turbine will produce 37 % {{of the total}} energy while the {{remaining}} 63 % {{will come from the}} diesel plant. Expected diesel consumption is also shown in Figure 8, and it is less than what is shown in Figure 5. Figure 8 shows that most of the electricity will be produced by wind energy during the winter season, and less energy should be expected during the summer season. Therefore, during summer, most of the electricity demand will be met from the diesel. Figure 8 also shows that the total electrical energy required for that area is 4, 281, 096 [*]kW[*]h/year, and 37 % of that will be met by the wind energy including the system peak demand. Figure 8 shows the monthly statistics and expected frequency histogram of battery state of charge. On average, the battery will be 70 % charged (i.e., upper reservoir will be 70 % full). The battery will be most used in July and August, while it will be least used in May. Effectively, this battery represents a pump hydro energy storage system with an overall efficiency of 70 %. During our visit to Ramea in September 2009, we looked for small ponds or lakes which can be used for a pumped <b>hydro</b> <b>installation.</b> We found two small ponds whose elevation is a few meters above sea level. A head of few meters is not good for a pump <b>hydro</b> <b>installation.</b> The hills in Ramea can be used for such a purpose.|$|E
40|$|Energy need is {{a primary}} {{requirement}} of our society. Many interests and concerns turn around this matter. It includes policy, economy, environment, etc [...] . Renewable energy {{is considered to be}} a good alternative from fossil sources and nuclear power. Renewable sources are known as “green” because of the low impact on the Earth equilibriums. Furthermore they are not exhaustible because they utilize the ecosystem cycles. Hydroelectricity is an established technology. In most of the industrialized countries large scale hydropower has been widely exploited, but there are possibilities of growth for mini-hydro schemes. In developing countries the unexploited potential is considered to be bigger. This thesis details an analysis into various aspects of hydropower, in particular it deals with micro-hydro and pico-hydro applications. A literature review about existing plants is presented; a few cases are shown in which pico hydro plants are used for the electrification of remote communities in developing countries. A feasibility study has been carried out for a hydroelectric installation on the Arno river (Italy). Three different solutions have been proposed for the realization of the scheme. One of them is a pico <b>hydro</b> <b>installation.</b> Hypothetical benefits from the plant realization have been evaluated, together with the scenario in which this plant would operate...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{availability}} of the electricity supply when the sources consist of a combination of solar energy and a small <b>hydro</b> <b>installation.</b> Instead of flow-of-river, a small reservoir is used. By not using the hydro energy during sunny periods, the natural flow-of-river fills up the reservoir for later use. A model for global solar radiation is proposed with an astronomical part (deterministic) and a meteorological part (stochastic). The meteorological part is based on a Markov model of the cloud coverage. The solar model does not require solar radiation measurements, just cloud observations. A case study has been performed for Timbuktu (16. 75 degreesN, 0. 07 degreesW) in which generation availability is simulated for four different cases: solar power only; solar power with storage; solar and hydro power and solar and hydro, power with storage. To be able to use exclusively renewable energy sources, a combination of sources is needed to secure the reliability of the supply. Using solar cells in combination with a small reservoir is favorable. Even with a weak flow the affect of the flow on the day time reliability is minor, but great benefits can be found for reliability during low load hours (night time) ...|$|E

Very low head installations of only a few meters may use propeller-type turbines in a pit.

40|$|When {{planning}} the production for certain hydropower plants, minimum pressure {{is one of}} the major critical points. Violation of the minimum pressure causes the power plant to automatically shut down, hence violating the obligations of the plant. Automatic pressure switches and pressure constraints are difficult to model in particular when embedded in a complex water way. This problem is expected to increase when retrofitting <b>hydro</b> <b>installations</b> with new parallel units and increased exploitation of inflow resources. From a scheduling point of view, however, such switches become hard to integrate in an optimal operation plan as the constraint depends on the system state. This paper introduces a novelty in short-term production planning, namely a solution for modelling minimum pressure height in regulated watercourses when optimizing the energy production of hydropower plants. This solution is integrated in the short-term hydropower scheduling tool SHOP. The tool finds an optimal strategy to run a power station with such minimum pressure restrictions and the state dependent topological couplings within the water system. We apply the model on a complex topology, the Sira-Kvina water system, where Norway's largest hydropower station Tonstad Kraftstajon is operationally subject to this rigorous pressure constraint. First, in order to illustrate the concepts of the model, we apply the model on a simplified water course including one reservoir. Next, the outcome and tests are demonstrated on the final model of two reservoirs whose respective outflows are joining together above the pressure gauge, as found in the Sira-Kvina water system...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a simplified propeller turbine unit to produce power in a low head micro hydroelectric power installation. To be appropriate for remote areas and developing countries, a micro hydro system needs to be simple in design. There are good turbine designs for medium to high heads but traditional designs for heads under about 10 m, ie, the crossflow turbine and waterwheel, are slow running, requiring substantial speed increase to drive an AC generator. Propeller turbines have a higher running speed but are normally too complicated for micro <b>hydro</b> <b>installations.</b> In this thesis a suitable propeller turbine was developed. The effect of flat blades and optimum turbine blade and guide vane angles has been determined, as has the effect of various cones attached to the downstream end of the hub. The large hub diameter is an important compromise. A prototype turbine for installation on a New Zealand farm was developed from model tests. The turbine has a hub diameter to blade tip diameter ratio of 0. 66 and 8 flat blades set at 30 ° to tangential (60 ° from axial). The best efficiency of the model turbine was 62 %, with an efficiency of 57 % at the best power point. Using scaling laws it is predicted that the prototype, with a blade tip diameter of 0. 410 m, will produce 6. 0 kW at 612 RPM from a head of 2. 7 m and a flow rate of 0. 41 m³/s. This gives 4. 3 kW output from the 50 Hz 2 -pole generator. This prediction is for no cone fitted on the downstream end of the hub, but model tests indicate that the power could be improved by about 5 % {{with the addition of a}} straight sided cone on the hub...|$|R
50|$|Micro hydro {{is a type}} of {{hydroelectric}} power that typically produces from 5 kW to 100 kW of electricity using the natural flow of water. Installations below 5 kW are called pico <b>hydro.</b> These <b>installations</b> can provide power to an isolated home or small community, or are sometimes connected to electric power networks, particularly where net metering is offered.There are many of these installations around the world, particularly in developing nations as they can provide an economical source of energy without the purchase of fuel. Micro hydro systems complement solar PV power systems because in many areas, water flow, and thus available hydro power, is highest in the winter when solar energy is at a minimum. Micro hydro is frequently accomplished with a pelton wheel for high head, low flow water supply. The installation is often just a small dammed pool, {{at the top of a}} waterfall, with several hundred feet of pipe leading to a small generator housing.|$|R
40|$|Introduction In May 2006 many {{rivers and}} creeks in the {{interior}} of Suriname caused flooding and a lot of inhabitants were surprised by the water. Over 22, 000 people were struck {{in a way that the}}ir houses were (temporarily) uninhabitable. In the most places the duration of the flooding was limited to three to six days, after that the waterlevel quickly dropped. Heavily struck villages were amongst others situated in the Upper?Suriname area. As a result of the flooding students of the TU Delft took the initiative to help the people {{in the interior}}. In August and September 2006 two groups of students of the TU Delft en de Anton de Kom University van Suriname visited the Upper?Suriname area. The first group did research regarding the drinking water situation and the second group did research regarding the implementation of an early warning system. The results of this research are published in “Leven met de Overstromingen, de implementatie van een waarschuwingssysteem in de binnenlanden van Suriname”. In September 2007 a follow up on this research has been undertaken by a new project group of the TU Delft. Once more the Upper?Suriname area has been visited with the goal of improving the warning system, do more research to the drinking water situation and to investigate the possibilities of micro hydro power. Warning system Because the last flooding happened such a long time ago a lot, people have been building their houses closer to the river, especially younger people. Therefore the damage caused by the flooding of May 2006 was extra large. The people were surprised by the fast raising water which caused flooding. Some of the houses even were totally under water or were washed away. The eventual goal of this part of the project is to implement an adequate warning system in a way that the inhabitants along the river Suriname can be warned in time for a flooding event. The technique behind such a system is a hydrological model to predict water levels. For such a model a lot of data of water levels and precipitation in the Upper?Suriname area is needed. Goal of this research is to make an improvement of the warning model with the use of this data and supplementary work in the area itself. Furthermore there has been worked together with the stakeholders on the implementation of a warning system. The work in the interior consisted of the repairing en replacement of the staff gauges which were placed by the project group 2006, doing discharge measurement en the determination of a location for autographic water level recorders. By making discharge?water level relations it is possible to estimate the velocity of the flood wave. Also water level relations between villages have been determined. Besides this a rainfall runoff model on a monthly scale is made. These models are far from perfect. Although it is a positive thing that two independent models generate result which are in the same order of magnitude. These models are however not yet good enough. When there are consistent data series of rainfall and water levels in the four visited villages and discharges at Pokigron all on a daily scale it will be possible to improve the models. The placing of autographic water level recorders can be a good addition to the present measurements. Drinking water In the Upper?Suriname area various organizations and governmental institutions are trying to improve the drinking water situation. The results however are mostly not sufficient despite the fact that the technical implementation is often good. The causes for this can be several, accordingly there are also a lot of different options that can lead to improvement. Therefore the various problems regarding the drinking water situation are analysed. The first problem is the different wet and dry periods. The wet periods result in turbid river water and the dry periods cause the creeks and the DURO?tanks to run dry. Secondly there is only a little awareness of the health risks with regard to pathogen organisms. As a result of that stomach and intestine inflammations are not related to the bad quality of the drinking water. Thirdly there is a lack of maintenance and management of the large scale as well as the small scale drinking water facilities. Lastly there are the problems with mercury in the water as a result of illegal gold mining; luckily this is not the case yet in the visited area. There are several methods available to easily improve the drinking water quality, taking into account all the problems mentioned above. It is advised to ‘organize’ a system for the improvement of the drinking water quality that has little costs, needs only little maintenance, does not rely on a single source type, has understandable functioning and fulfils the desires and needs of the people that will use it. There is a system in development that could fulfil these demands. Different aspects of this system still need to be worked out such as: the technicalities (with as goal purified and bacteriological reliable drinking water), the design (adapted to the environment of implementation), social acceptation (willingness of the people to use the system) and the local availability of the different parts of the system. The research which has been done in the Upper?Suriname area consisted of three different parts and experiments. The first experiment consisted of the social research in several villages within in village cluster. In this social the main focus was the way people of the interior use their ‘drinking’water. From this boundary conditions can be derived for the system that is currently in development. A second experiment was the research to the working of UV?disinfection of water in the area. The third experiment was based on the use of DURO?tanks. These DURO?tanks, which are being used to collect rain water are distributed along the village, some tanks are meant for private and others for public use. Calculations have been made the numbers, the exact location and the volumes of the DURO?tanks. With a simulation of rainfall and wateruse whether there is enough water for consumption throughout the year. This was however not the case, which confirmed the supposition that DURO?tanks are not a soundly solution. Micro hydro power At this moment electricity is hardly available in time as well as quantity in the villages of the Upper?Suriname area. Some small villages do not have electricity facilities at all. The Dutch government sees basic electricity facilities as crucial for the reaching of all the millennium development goals. Micro hydro power is one of the possibilities to supply electricity in remote areas. To make a decent consideration between micro hydro power and other options, one has to know all the pros and cons. To make a good decision there are several things one needs to know, the demand for electricity, the organization for the financial management, which kind of maintenance and operational management can fit in the culture and the possibilities and desires to undertake economic activities with the supplied power. More specific for micro hydro power one has to know what energy potential is available against which price, because one cannot just place a micro <b>hydro</b> power <b>installation</b> just anywhere and a large part of the costs (75 %) depend on the chosen location. There one needs to know all the hydrological and spatial limiting conditions, such as the head drop and the discharge throughout the year, the distance to the village en the distance within the villages and the population density. As much missing information concerning the spatial and hydrological limiting conditions has been added in such a way that a good consideration of the pros and cons can be made, if completed with other information beyond the scope of this research, such as the social structure of the area and options based on that to set up a maintenance, management and financial structure. Concluded from the known hydrological and hydraulical limiting conditions it is very well possible to build a micro <b>hydro</b> power <b>installation</b> in the Upper?Suriname area. Tapawatra seems to be the most logical option, bearing in mind the vicinity of the villages, but in a hydrological sense also Gran Dan offers good possibilities. A year of measurements is however required before this can be said with more certainty. For the technical design there are also a lot of options and it seems to be the case that a relatively expensive installation is most suitable for this case. It is of course tempting to build as cheap as possible, but this is perhaps less so than it seems, bearing in mind the remoteness of the area and the lacking local knowledge. In case there is a small problem to the cheap maintenance sensitive installation, this would already result in long downtime. It pays off to invest in a reliable, robust installation.
