5|$|Humans {{began the}} {{physical}} {{exploration of space}} during the 20th century {{with the advent of}} high-altitude balloon flights, followed by manned rocket launches. <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> was first achieved by Yuri Gagarin of the Soviet Union in 1961, and unmanned spacecraft have since reached all of the known planets in the Solar System. Due to the high cost of getting into space, manned spaceflight has been limited to low <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> and the Moon.|$|E
5|$|Apollo set major {{milestones}} {{in human}} spaceflight. It stands alone in sending manned missions beyond low <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit,</b> and landing humans on another celestial body. Apollo 8 {{was the first}} manned spacecraft to orbit another celestial body, while Apollo 17 marked the last moonwalk and the last manned mission beyond low <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> to date. The program spurred advances {{in many areas of}} technology peripheral to rocketry and manned spaceflight, including avionics, telecommunications, and computers. Apollo sparked interest in many fields of engineering and left many physical facilities and machines developed for the program as landmarks. Many objects and artifacts from the program are on display at various locations throughout the world, notably at the Smithsonian's Air and Space Museums.|$|E

50|$|The {{eccentricity}} of the <b>Earth's</b> <b>orbit</b> {{is currently}} about 0.0167; the <b>Earth's</b> <b>orbit</b> is nearly circular. Venus and Neptune have even lower eccentricities. Over {{hundreds of thousands}} of years, the eccentricity of the <b>Earth's</b> <b>orbit</b> varies from nearly 0.0034 to almost 0.058 as a result of gravitational attractions among the planets (see graph).|$|R

5000|$|The asteroid's orbit {{must not}} cross <b>Earth's</b> <b>orbit.</b> The most {{commonly}} used definition of this (which Wikipedia uses) is that it never orbits closer to the Sun than Earth's average distance from the Sun (1.000 AU). A more strict definition is that [...] "at any point along the asteroid's <b>orbit,</b> <b>Earth's</b> <b>orbit</b> {{is closer to the}} Sun". This takes into consideration the fact that <b>Earth's</b> <b>orbit</b> ranges between 0.983 and 1.016 AU from the Sun.|$|R

5|$|Black Arrow, officially capitalised BLACK ARROW, was a British {{satellite}} carrier rocket. Developed {{during the}} 1960s, {{it was used}} for four launches between 1969 and 1971.

In February 2010, President Barack Obama's administration proposed eliminating public funds for the Constellation program and shifting greater responsibility of servicing the ISS to private companies. During {{a speech at the}} Kennedy Space Center on April 15, 2010, Obama proposed a new heavy-lift vehicle (HLV) to replace the formerly planned Ares V. In his speech, Obama called for a manned mission to an asteroid as soon as 2025, and a manned mission to Mars orbit by the mid-2030s. The NASA Authorization Act of 2010 was passed by Congress and signed into law on October 11, 2010. The act officially canceled the Constellation program.|$|E

5|$|Flights from Earth {{to other}} planets in the Solar System {{have a high}} energy cost. It {{requires}} almost {{the same amount of}} energy for a spacecraft to reach Jupiter from Earth's orbit as it does to lift it into orbit in the first place. In astrodynamics, this energy expenditure is defined by the net change in the spacecraft's velocity, or delta-v. The energy needed to reach Jupiter from an <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> requires a delta-v of about 9km/s, compared to the 9.0–9.5km/s to reach a low <b>Earth</b> <b>orbit</b> from the ground. Gravity assists through planetary flybys (such as by Earth or Venus) can be used to reduce the energetic requirement (i.e. the fuel) at launch, at the cost of a significantly longer flight duration to reach a target such as Jupiter when compared to the direct trajectory. Ion thrusters capable of a delta-v of more than 10 kilometers/s were used on the Dawn spacecraft. This is more than enough delta-v to do a Jupiter fly-by mission from a solar orbit of the same radius as that of Earth without gravity assist.|$|E
