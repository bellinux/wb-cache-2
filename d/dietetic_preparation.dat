40|$|The {{present study}} compares, in healthy subjects, {{the effects of}} red cooked meat and of a <b>dietetic</b> <b>preparation</b> with an {{equivalent}} amount of protein but with another distribution of amino acids. Our findings would imply that all proteins do not share the same capacity to induce glomerular hyperfiltration. Thus, {{the nature of the}} proteins has {{to be taken into account}} in the dietetic prescription.

40|$|A dietary {{approach}} {{has proven to}} be effective in alleviating symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. In our previous studies, magnesium improved premenstrual irritability and mood scoings. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we evaluated the effects of a new <b>dietetic</b> <b>preparation</b> (Sillix Donna(R), Giuliani) in 40 patients affected by mild to moderate premenstrual syndrome. Premenstrual symptoms were scored in both follicular and luteal phases, at baseline, at 2 nd, 4 th and 6 th month of treatment by using the Menstrual Distress Questionnaire (MDQ). Twenty patients were randomised to receive the active preparation and 20 placebo. MDQ scores at baseline were similar in the two groups. Five patients of the placebo group dropped out because of treatment failure. No side effects were observed. Both treatments reduced symptoms already in the 2 nd month, but the active preparation was more effective at all time controls (p < 0. 05); at the 6 th month it significantly reduced premenstrual MDQ scores to 18 % of baseline values, placebo only to 73 %. These data demonstrate that Sillix Donna is effective in reducing premenstrual distress...|$|E
40|$|Highest {{share in}} {{products}} with whey proteins addition belongs to aromatised drinks, aromatised protein bars and various <b>dietetic</b> <b>preparations.</b> In {{the last few}} years, there is increased use of the extrusion process for production of food products. This process is, besides other things, used for obtaining directly expanded products, which are immediately packed and sent on market after mechanical and thermal treatment in extruder, or after drying for a short time. One of these food products is “snack” food. Snack food is made with twin corotating screw extruders, in which raw materials are submitted to high temperatures and short time, with intensive expansion and rapid pressure drop. For the production of this category of food products, basic ingredients like corn, wheat, rye and rice, with the maximum of 9 % of proteins, are used. With the development of extrusion technology, special {{attention is focused on}} the enrichment of extruded products with different types of proteins, including proteins. In this paper, review of the newest research and achievements in embedding various types of whey concentrates in snack food will be represented. This category of food products for direct consummation is constantly increasing, and addition of whey protein concentrate adds better nutritional value and increased functionality...|$|R
40|$|Lectins are a {{structurally}} diverse {{class of}} (glyco) proteins which bind mono- and oligosaccharides with high specificity {{and in a}} reversible way. For many years, the unique sugar binding properties of plant lectins have been exploited {{for the development of}} biochemical tools for glycoprotein isolation and characterisation, and the use of lectins as a glycoprofiling tool has became much more sophisticated with the advent of lectin microarrays, in which a panel of lectins are immobilized on a single chip for glycomic analysis. Among the numerous lectins studied so far, those from legumes represent the largest family. They can be present at relatively high amounts depending on genetic as well as environmental factors, and are accumulated especially in the seeds. For this reason, some lectins as the phytohemagglutinin from the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris constitute a possible risk, since consumption of raw or incorrectly processed beans has been shown to cause outbreaks of gastroenteritis, nausea and diarrhoea. On the other hand, for these anti-nutritional properties, bean extracts enriched in lectins or in lectin-related amylase inhibitors are also finding a growing use as active ingredients of "weight-blockers" in <b>dietetic</b> <b>preparations</b> for obesity treatment. Current methods to determine the lectin levels in foods are based on immunoenzymatic or toxicity tests, which are largely aspecific. Very recently, the availability of proteomic methodologies has allowed to start development and validation of sensitive and specific assays for detecting trace amounts of harmful lectins in either raw or processed foods. In this review, the main aspects of current and perspective applications of mass spectrometry and proteomic technologies to the structural characterisation of legumes are presented, with focus on issues related to detection, identification, and quantification of phytohemagglutinins relevant for their biochemical, immunological and toxicological aspect...|$|R
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the student {{perception}} of competency development in nutrition and dietetics and the perceived impact of pre-placement preparation, the clinical placement learning environment, learning exposures and supervision on this. Methods: A qualitative investigation using semistructured interviews with 26 graduate students who had recently completed their final clinical placement, recruited purposively from three Australian universities was employed. Thematic analysis of the interview transcripts and triangular analysis of data was undertaken by the research team, with a mix of descriptive and interpretive analysis. Results: Students across all three universities generally described the placement experience as intense, personally challenging and a steep learning curve. Students felt they had adequate theoretical knowledge prior to placement but were less prepared for the practical application of their skills in a clinical setting. The learning environment varied across placement sites, with physical, organisation and social environmental factors all contributing to the students reported pathway to confidence and competence in practice. The style of supervision and supervisory practices varied considerably and emerged as a significant factor impacting on competency development. Conclusions: Nutrition and dietetic students appear to have a hierarchy of psychosocial and educational needs that need to be met in the placement environment in order to achieve competency. The present study provides a framework for enhancing the student experience and the effectiveness of clinical placements as a component of <b>dietetic</b> workforce <b>preparation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{describe}} {{the size and}} demographic, education, experience and practice attributes of the core academic dietetic educator (ADEd) workforce in Australia. Methods: A self-administered, cross-sectional survey was electronically distributed to ADEds at 18 Australian universities offering dietetic programs. Data from survey responses were collated and descriptively analysed. Results: From a total sample frame of 147 ADEds identiﬁed by websites, responses were received from 91 eligible ADEds (response rate = 62 %), {{with at least one}} participant from each university offering a dietetics program in Australia. The sample was not representative of more senior ADEds, and therefore the core ADEd workforce. Rather, the sample was typically female aged 30 – 39 years with a Lecturer level, full-time appointment who cited clinical dietetics as their main area of practice specialisation. Around half of the sample had yet to complete a PhD and had ﬁve years or less of experience working as a dietetic educator or a dietetic researcher. Conclusions: The ﬁndings were limited to emerging ADEds due to the non-participation and underrepresentation of more credentialed ADEds. The sample was relatively young and inexperienced in dietetic education and research. This may reﬂect the rapid expansion of dietetic education programs in Australia over the past decade and limited workforce surge capacity. Nevertheless the data reﬂect a small workforce group with the capacity to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence future dietetic practitioners. Ongoing research and workforce development strategies are required to support the dietetic educator workforce and further enhance <b>dietetic</b> workforce <b>preparation</b> in Australi...|$|R
