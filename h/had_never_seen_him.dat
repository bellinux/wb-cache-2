5|$|The {{funeral service}} for Pat Nixon {{took place in}} the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. It was a rare display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> more distraught.|$|E
500|$|He {{died of a}} self-inflicted {{gunshot wound}} after the {{shooting}} ended. ABC News reports that his behavior seemed to become more erratic in {{the weeks leading up}} to the shooting, and that it is believed he stopped taking medication beforehand. His girlfriend, Jessica Baty, confirmed that Kazmierczak was taking Xanax (anti-anxiety), Ambien (sleep aid), and Prozac (antidepressant), all of which were prescribed to him by a psychiatrist. She said that he stopped taking Prozac about three weeks prior to the February 14 shooting. She also said that, during their two-year courtship, she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> display violent tendencies and she expressed bewilderment over the cause of the rampage. [...] "He was anything but a monster," [...] Baty said. [...] "He was probably the nicest, most caring person ever." ...|$|E
500|$|MacLaren {{was invited}} by the Melbourne Cricket Club {{to bring a}} team to Australia during the English winter of 1901–02. This was the last privately {{organised}} team to represent England at Test level in Australia, with subsequent ones playing under the colours of the MCC. Many leading players were unavailable—Yorkshire's Wilfred Rhodes and George Hirst were not permitted to tour by their captain Lord Hawke. The team was judged to be weak, but contained several players {{at the beginning of}} their careers who went on to success at Test level. Sydney Barnes was chosen by MacLaren after playing only a handful of county matches. Barnes' success on his single appearance for Lancashire in 1901 convinced MacLaren of his worth, to the surprise and disparagement of commentators, most of whom <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> Barnes began the tour well, but did not get on with his captain. During a storm on part of the sea journey, MacLaren, speculating on their chances of survival, commented to a team member: [...] "If we go down, at least that bugger Barnes will go down with us." [...] The team lost their first match and continued to struggle. MacLaren clashed with authorities in Melbourne over his right to choose an umpire, but he began to bat well at Sydney, where he scored 145 and 73 in a tour match.|$|E

2500|$|Davis {{said the}} legal team had filed a writ {{of habeas corpus}} on Al-Utaybi's behalf in September 2005. He said that the DoD claimed their writ was invalid because they had spelled his name wrong. The {{department}} did not grant them the security clearances necessary to visit Al Utaybi, so they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> Davis said that the DoD would not deliver their mail to Al Utaybi although official policy was that detainees could not [...] "lose mail privileges for any reason.": ...|$|E
2500|$|After a {{year and}} a half of marriage, his new wife <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> perform in front of an audience, and the first {{occasion}} came unplanned. As told by actor comedian Alan King, it happened during a dinner by the New York Friars' Club at the Waldorf Astoria in 1946, honoring the career of Sophie Tucker. Jolson and his wife were in the audience along with a thousand others, and George Jessel was MC. He asked Al, privately, to perform at least one song. Jolson replied, [...] "No, I just want to sit here." ...|$|E
2500|$|EastEnders lead {{director}} Matthew Robinson {{recommended the}} actor Leslie Grantham for the part. Grantham had previously {{appeared on the}} London Fringe in a stage play Robinson had written. His only TV appearance at that point had been as Kiston, a small part in a 1984 Doctor Who serial Resurrection of the Daleks directed by Robinson. Julia Smith remembered that she had taught Grantham at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and regarded him as a [...] "mature student", although she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> [...] "in action". They needed the character of Den to have [...] "panache, charisma and electricity". They were initially uncertain about casting Grantham, but they both felt that the actor had [...] "something", which {{they went on to}} describe as a [...] "tensed up internal emotion of some sort, that was being held in. There was something behind the eyes, too. Barely contained violence almost..." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Show me him,' {{said the}} lady, eagerly. 'I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> yet; I am {{actually}} dying to know him. You {{know we have}} just come to town.' ...|$|R
60|$|DORA. Perhaps, Master Dobson. I can't tell, for I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> But {{my sister}} {{wrote that he}} was mighty pleasant, and had no pride in him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> and <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> any {{portrait}} or {{photograph of}} him,' Lyon said. 'I'm surprised at his <b>never</b> <b>having</b> had anything done--at their waiting all these years.' ...|$|R
60|$|His {{face was}} moving strangely. They <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> so discomposed.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} he {{is a sad}} old rascal," [...] said Herbert, smiling, [...] "but I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him.</b> Don't you smell rum? He is always at it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Raine {{said that}} Bell was [...] "entirely devoid of humor", and [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> smile {{except when he}} was telling how he had {{hammered}} the Western Federation." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not again. I {{was married}} {{eighteen}} {{years ago in}} Russia. My husband was transported to Siberia {{a few days after}} we were married, and I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> since." ...|$|R
60|$|Alec {{began to}} {{walk up and down}} excitedly. Dick <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before in such a state.|$|E
60|$|The Duke {{looked at}} her for a moment as I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> look at any living person.|$|E
60|$|Alick's {{response}} was to bend over her, and kiss her brow. She <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> so much gratified.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{reminds me}} of somebody," [...] she said absently, [...] "but I can't think who it is. Of course, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before. What a good face he has!" ...|$|R
60|$|Thyme thought: 'I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{as bad as}} this!' She {{drew him}} on more quickly. With deep relief she saw her father, {{latchkey}} in hand, turning into the Old Square.|$|R
6000|$|The Duchess. No, no! for God's sake, no, Miss Mary! He <b>has</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> {{from his}} birth: {{he does not}} know him. He will disown him. He will curse him,--will curse me! ...|$|R

60|$|The dog first {{attracted}} his attention; then {{he heard}} her, and turned round. She <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> looking so despondent.|$|E
60|$|Tho. No, no, I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> before, to be sure; but, for all that, I know 'twas the Devil.|$|E
6000|$|Fred had {{not meant}} to tell this, but he was obliged now to say, [...] "Yes, he was. But I suppose it was an {{accidental}} thing. I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> there before." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, {{disappeared}} utterly and forever. We hunted {{high and}} low for him and offered a big reward for any information. It was useless. We <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> or heard a word of him since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>see</b> <b>him</b> {{more from}} the family point of view, I suppose," [...] Letitia observed, [...] "and yet, in a way, he is rather a {{wonderful}} person. For instance, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> hurry, I <b>have</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>him</b> angry, in the ordinary sense of the word; in fact he has the most amazing complacency I ever knew. Of course, Aunt Caroline," [...] she went on, turning to the Duchess a few moments later, [...] "if {{you want to stay}} with the men, pray do so. If not, you might take into account the fact that I have been trying to catch your eye for the last three minutes." ...|$|R
