Place and Duration of Study: Laboratory of <b>Food</b> <b>Biochemistry</b> and Tropical Products Technology, and the laboratory of Biotechnology and Food Microbiology, University of Nangui Abrogoua, Abidjan, between October 2010 and December 2011. Study Design: Method based on AOAC tests and AFNOR for microbiological analysis. A two-way analysis of variance and t-test were used. Methodology: The proximate composition of soaked and non soaked cowpea grains was determined and microbiological (bacteriological and mycological) analysis of these grains was also performed. Results: The major components were 28 % and 26. 25 % protein, 48. 35 % and 47. 99 % carbohydrate, 41. 66 % and 40. 05 % starch for the RC (red cultivar) and WC (white cultivar) respectively. Lipids are less represented in the 2 cultivars (2. 5 %). There were significant reductions in {{the contents of the}} major components {{as a result of the}} treatment. Plain water soaking brought about a significant decrease in the proximate composition causing a mean reduction of 3. 14 % and 10. 02 % protein, 28. 23 % and 29. 30 % carbohydrate, 29. 47 % and 28. 94 % starch, 18. 80 % and 22. 02 % energy for the RC and WC respectively. The mean decrease for mineral was 23. 13 % and 47. 66 % iron, 2. 32 % and 8. 15 % calcium, 9. 30 % and 2. 10 % phosphorus for the RC and WC respectively. In general the highest reduction was observed in the WC variety.

In order to set an experiment in a growth chamber, grey brown podzolic soil formed from loesses and taken from a mechanically treated belt of black fallow was used. The soil (1000 g) was watered every 8 days with 100 ml of examined chitosan solutions per pot. Control soil was watered with sterile distilled water. Seven days after each watering, soil samples were taken for microbiological analysis. Then 25 runner bean seeds were sown into each pot. After six weeks of plants' growth the experiment was finished and the number of plants was counted, their healthiness determined and soil microbiological analysis was performed. Regardless of chitosan form introduced to the soil it stimulated the growth of bacteria and fungi, since in these experimental combinations was found a significantly higher number of microorganisms as compared with the control. A particular high {{increase in the number of}} microorganism colonies was observed with simultaneous growth of plants and the application of chitosan. A considerable increase of fungi colonies from the Trichoderma genus was found in the soil treated with chitosan in the form ofboth a microcrystalline gel and a liquid. The species of this genus are considered to be antagonists; it affects pathogenic fungi through competition, antibiosis and over-parasitism. An increase in colonies of saprophytic microorganisms, including antagonistic ones of Bacillus spp. and Pseudomonas spp. was observed in the soil treated with chitosan. On the other hand, in the soil after the growth of bean and treated watered with chitosan only few colonies of Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. phaseoli- bean pathogen were found. The healthiness of plants grown in soil treated with chitosan was significantly better as compared to the control.

40|$|Rubus species, {{including}} raspberries, {{have been}} used since ancient times {{for the treatment of}} wounds, diarrhea, colic pain, diabetes, etc. [1]. Being among the fruits with higher antioxidant contents, raspberries are receiving increasing attention as a source of potentially healthy compounds that can help prevent cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus [2]. A large part of the health effects attributed to berries is supposed to be due to polyphenolic compounds. The majority of raspberries polyphenols are ellagitannins, but they also contain large amounts of anthocyanins (in red raspberries) and smaller amounts of hydroxycinnamic acids, flavonols, flavan- 3 -ols and proanthocyanidins [3]. Yellow raspberries, which lack anthocyanins at all, seem to be as effective or even more effective than their red counterparts at inhibiting enzymes with potential impact on chronic diabetes or hypertension [4, 5]. From the biosynthetic point of view there is as yet no information on where the block of the anthocyanin pathway in yellow raspberries could be. In this study a targeted UPLC-MS/MS method recently developed by our lab was used to screen 140 phenolic compounds including benzoates, phenylpropanoids, coumarins, stilbenes, dihydrochalcones and flavonoids, using MRM transitions for accurate quantification. The fruits of different plants of 4 red and 6 yellow raspberry varieties, at different ripening stages (green, turning and ripe) where analyzed. Around 34 phenolic compounds where detected above the quantification limit at the different ripening stages. This allowed to obtain not only a profile of the phenolic composition of the different raspberry varieties, at different stages, but also to highlight the different tendencies in the variation of concentration of each of the different compounds during ripening. Furthermore, a general biosynthetic scheme and a prediction of the mechanism underlaying the loss of anthocyanisn in yellow raspberries can be predicted [1] G. Rocabado, L. Bedoya, M. Abad, P.

Its {{purpose is to}} advance public education, training, research and development {{in the field of}} food science and technology through its main database Food Science and Technology Abstracts (FSTA). FSTA summarizes as an 'abstract' each item of the world's literature that is relevant to food science and technology as it is published. FSTA is therefore an information source in itself, a pointer to thousands of other sources, and a barometer of what is new in research and development. FSTA is growing at the rate of nearly 18, 000 entries per year {{and by the end of}} 1992 the overall number of entries totalled 415, 000. These cover basic sciences relevant to <b>food</b> (<b>biochemistry,</b> microbiology, biotechnology, toxicology, etc.) as well as food processing, food products, and economics and legislation. The abstracts provide a concise, informative summary of the original item, and special arrangements for access to the original literature are in place for users who cannot obtain it locally. FSTA and its photocopy back-up service provide a lead into the world's literature on food science and technology and stress the importance of applying research to development activities. FSTA is available in print, online and on magnetic tape, and on compact disc (CD-ROM). The CD-ROM version of FSTA is fast and easy to search using Silver Platter information retrieval software (SPIRS). Quarterly updates of FSTA on CD-ROM are available from 1993. As a new service IFIS offers Food science profiles (FSP) which are monthly bibliographies retrieved from FSTA with a choice of 30 tailored food topics. They are available in print as well as on diskette suitable for use with micro-CDS/ISIS. IFIS' policy for the future is to provide information services on food that meet the needs of people in the research and development, industrial, teaching and government sectors. Identifying information needs that could be met by new products and services for a worldwide clientele in this way is a major undertaking for the next few years.

For this purpose, a pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design was used, with a non-equivalent control group. The sample was constituted by 154 students, divided into 4 groups: G 1 (n= 29) was the one that received the whole program; G 2 (n= 18) was the one that only received psychological support; G 3 (n= 61) was the group that exclusively received academic tutoring in the critical subjects; and finally G 4 (n= 46), the control group that did not received any type of support. The obtained results show that the program produced a significant improvement of the academic performance of the students, which was reflected in the passing grades of previously failed subjects in comparison to the ones obtained by the control group.
