40|$|Significant R&D {{progress}} {{has been done in}} the area of SHM technologies in recent years. However real SHM application on aircraft board is still challenging and puts specific requirements on the SHM system design and operation. These challenges <b>include</b> <b>assurance</b> <b>of</b> reliable and provable damage detection capabilities, taking over decision-making responsibilities instead of a human inspector and other challenges related to on-board installation and operation during the flight. Further, minimal weight and dimension, and system reliability and durability should be considered. Due to these challenging requirements the SHM has not been widely implemented in aerospace industry yet. The paper deals with system architecture and operational concept of SHM system for L- 410 NG commuter aircraft. The SHM system is based on excitation, sensing and analysis of ultrasonic guided waves using PZT actuators / sensors. The SHM system is designed for monitoring of PSEs of metallic airframe that are hard to access or completely inaccessible for common inspection methods used in the aircraft maintenance. The design puts emphasis on integration of the SHM system within aircraft avionic system in order to achieve highly automated data acquisition and data transfer process to make the health data available for on-ground analysis. Finally, scenario of the SHM system operation in accordance to the L- 410 NG maintenance plan is proposed in the paper. The scenario assumes replacement of common inspections that are done within regular maintenance checks by the automated inspections using SHM system. Challenges of the proposed scenario {{from the point of view}} of the aircraft certification and operation are discussed as well. 1...|$|R

Distinguishing Methodist doctrines <b>include</b> an <b>assurance</b> <b>of</b> salvation, imparted righteousness, the possibility of perfection in love, the works of piety, and the primacy of Scripture. Most Methodists teach that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, died for all of humanity and that salvation is available for all; in theology, this view is known as Arminianism. This teaching rejects the Calvinist position that God has pre-ordained the salvation of a select group of people. However, Whitefield and several others were considered Calvinistic Methodists and held to the Calvinistic position. Methodism emphasises charity and support for the sick, the poor, and the afflicted through the works of mercy. These ideals are put into practice by the establishment of hospitals, orphanages, soup kitchens, and schools to follow Christ's command to spread the gospel and serve all people.|$|R

Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and South Carolina held conventions in 1865, while Texas' convention did not organize until March 1866. Johnson hoped to prevent deliberation over whether to re-admit the Southern states by accomplishing full ratification before Congress reconvened in December.

5000|$|In Reformed theology, the {{practical}} syllogism (syllogismus practicus) {{is a concept}} relating <b>assurance</b> <b>of</b> salvation to evidence in a person's life of such, such as good works and sanctification.

Works {{are said to be}} the epistemological ground of faith and justification, rather than the ontological ground, because the evidences of faith only make faith apparent; they do not create it.John Calvin recognizes that outward signs of God's favor may confirm faith, but warns against inferring election from such signs.
