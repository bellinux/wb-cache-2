5|$|Copernicium is {{calculated}} to have several properties {{that differ from}} its lighter homologues in group 12, zinc, cadmium and mercury; due to relativistic effects, it may even give up its 6d electrons instead of its 7s ones. Copernicium <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> calculated to possibly show the oxidation state +4, while mercury shows it in only one compound of disputed existence and zinc and cadmium do not show it at all, although more recent calculations cast doubt on this possibility. It <b>has</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> predicted {{to be more difficult}} to oxidize copernicium from its neutral state than the other group 12 elements.|$|E
2500|$|Forged {{cancellations}} <b>have</b> <b>also</b> <b>been</b> {{applied to}} genuine stamps, {{in cases where}} the stamps are worth much more postally used.
