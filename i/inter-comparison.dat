[...] Winds are often used to measure intensity as they commonly cause notable impacts over large areas, and most popular tropical cyclone scales are organized around sustained wind speeds. [...] However variations in the averaging period of winds in different basins make <b>inter-comparison</b> difficult. [...] In addition, other impacts like rainfall, storm surge, area of wind damages, and tornadoes can be significant variations in storms with similar wind speeds. [...] Pressure {{is often used to}} compare tropical cyclones because measurements is easier to measure and consistent. [...] Tropical cyclones can attain some of the lowest pressures over large areas on Earth. [...] However, although there is strong connection between lowered pressures and higher wind speeds, storms with the lowest pressures may not have the highest wind speeds, as each storm's relationship between wind and pressure is slightly different.|$|E

The {{issue of}} {{comparability}} of measurements (and thus bias, accuracy, and precision of measurement) from diverse laboratories is one {{which has been}} the focus of some attention both within the radiocarbon community and the wider user communities.

The different technologies currently on the market, each have certain strengths and weaknesses when it comes to operating in different environments. There is a plethora of comparative tests on-going with sometimes contradictory results. This paper investigates device behaviour of contrasting thin film technologies, specifically a-Si and CIGS derivatives, and places this analysis into context with results reported by others. Specific consideration is given to the accuracy of module <b>inter-comparisons,</b> as most outdoor monitoring at this scale is conducted to compare devices against one another. It is shown that there are five main contributors to differences in energy delivery and the magnitude of these depends on the environments in which the devices are operated. The paper shows that two effects, typically not considered in <b>inter-comparisons,</b> dominate the reported energy delivery. Environmental influences such as light intensity, spectrum and operating temperature introduce performance variations typically in the range of 2 – 7 % {{in the course of a}} year. However, most comparative tests are carried out only for short periods of time, in the order of months.

40|$|The World Ocean Database 2005 as of May 2009 {{is used to}} {{estimate}} temperature and sample depth biases of expendable (XBT) and mechanical (MBT) bathythermographs by comparing bathythermograph temperature profiles with more accurate bottle and conductivity/temperature/depth (CTD) data. It is shown that the application of depth corrections estimated earlier from side-by-side XBT/CTD <b>inter-comparisons,</b> without accounting for a pure thermal bias, leads to even larger disagreement with the CTD and bottle reference temperatures. Our calculations give evidence for a depth-variable XBT fall-rate correction with the manufacturer-derived depth being underestimated in the upper 200 m and overestimated below this depth. These results are in agreement with side-by-side <b>inter-comparisons</b> and direct fall-rate estimates. Correcting XBT sample depths by a multiplicative factor which is constant with depth does not allow an effective elimination of the total temperature bias throughout the whole water column. The analysis further suggests a dependence of the fall rate on the water temperature which was reported earlier in the literature. Comparison among different correction schemes implies a significant impact of systematic biases on the estimates of the global ocean heat content anomaly. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The GCSS {{working group}} on cirrus focuses on an <b>inter-comparison</b> of model {{simulations}} ranging from very detailed microphysical and dynamical models through to general circulation models (GCMs). The past GCSS cirrus cloud <b>inter-comparison</b> highlighted the wide range in modelling results that {{was a surprise to}} the modelling community. That <b>inter-comparison</b> was idealised and, therefore, a key issue was that it did not benefit from observations to help distinguish between model performances. In this work, we aim to address this key issue by developing an observationally based case study to be used for the GCSS cirrus modelling <b>inter-comparison</b> study. We focused on developing a case that had sufficient observations with which to evaluate models, to help identify which models in the <b>inter-comparison</b> are performing well and highlight areas for model development. Furthermore, it will provide a base case for future model comparisons or testing of new or updated models. This paper outlines the modelling case development and the <b>inter-comparison</b> results will be presented in a follow-on paper. The case was based on the 9 March 2000 Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Southern Great Plains (SGP) during an intensive observation period (IOP). The case was developed utilising various observations including ARM SGP remote sensing including the MilliMeter Cloud Radar (MMCR), radiometers, radiosondes, aircraft observations, satellite observations, objective analysis and complemented with results from the Rapid Update Cycle (RUC) model as well as bespoke gravity wave simulations used to provide the best estimate for large scale forcing. The retrievals of ice water content, ice number concentration and fall velocity provide several constraints to evaluate model performances. Initial testing of the case has been reported using the UK Met Office Large Eddy Simulation Model (LEM) which suggests the case is appropriate for the model <b>inter-comparison</b> study. To our knowledge, this case offers the most detailed case study for cirrus comparison available and we anticipate this will offer significant benefits over past comparisons which have mostly been loosely based on observations...|$|E

40|$|VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imager Radiometer Suite) onboard the Suomi NPP (National Polar-orbiting Partnership) {{satellite}} {{has been}} acquiring Earth observations {{for more than}} a year. During that time, SNO (Simultaneous Nadir Overpass) events have provided many opportunities for <b>inter-comparisons</b> between VIIRS and the MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) instruments from the Aqua and Terra satellites. The SNOs have occurred over snow-covered Antarctica, which provided bright surfaces in the visible and near-infrared bands, as well as over northern Alaska, Canada, Greenland, Scandinavia, Siberia, and ocean, with both dark and bright scenes that frequently include clouds. Top-of-atmosphere reflectance values measured by VIIRS during the SNO events were found to be highly correlated with the MODIS data for the corresponding spectral bands. The SNO comparisons have helped improve VIIRS radiometric performance and accuracy of its data products. Comparing VIIRS with two MODIS instruments has not only reduced uncertainty of the SNO measurements, but also allowed for <b>inter-comparisons</b> between the MODIS instruments from two spacecraft. For most of the reflective solar bands, biases between VIIRS and MODIS are small and are similar for both MODIS instruments. Radiative transfer modeling has shown that the observed discrepancies can be attributed to differences between spectral responses of VIIRS and MODIS. With some exceptions, inferred biases between MODIS measurements are within uncertainty of the radiometric calibrations. The largest bias occurs {{in the case of the}} 488 -nm band from MODIS on Terra, despite improved radiometric calibration of the MODIS Level 1 B Collection 6 data products.

40|$|Radiocarbon {{measurement}} is a well-established, routinely used, yet complex {{series of}} inter-linked procedures. The degree of sample pre-treatment varies considerably {{depending on the}} material, the methods of processing pre-treated material vary across laboratories and the detection of 14 C at low levels remains challenging. As in any complex measurement process, the questions of quality assurance and quality control become paramount, both internally, i. e. within a laboratory and externally, across laboratories. The issue of comparability of measurements (and thus bias, accuracy and precision of measurement) from the diverse laboratories {{is one that has}} been the focus of considerable attention for some time, both within the 14 C community and the wider user communities. In the early years of the technique when there was only a small number of laboratories in existence, <b>inter-comparisons</b> would function on an ad hoc basis, usually involving small numbers of laboratories (e. g. Otlet et al, 1980). However, as more laboratories were set-up and the detection methods were further developed (e. g. new AMS facilities), the need for more systematic work was recognised. The international efforts to create a global calibration curve also requires the use of data generated by different laboratories at different times, so that evidence of laboratory offsets is needed to inform curve formation. As a result of these factors, but also as part of general good laboratory practice, including laboratory benchmarking and quality assurance, the 14 C community has undertaken a wide-scale, far-reaching and evolving programme of global <b>inter-comparisons,</b> to the benefit of laboratories and users alike.
