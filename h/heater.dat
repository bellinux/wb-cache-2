50|$|Although oil <b>heaters</b> {{are more}} {{expensive}} to run and provide far less spatial heating than gas <b>heaters,</b> they are still commonly used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because gas <b>heaters,</b> especially when unflued, are not suitable for bedroom use - gas <b>heaters</b> cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced oxygen, and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered <b>heaters,</b> such as oil <b>heaters</b> and fan <b>heaters,</b> as the only alternative.|$|R

5|$|A typical {{feature in}} Vanajas was over-engineered {{structures}} which were robust rather than optimised. The main components were sourced from well-established suppliers. VAT also showed progressive thinking in driver ergonomics; the comfortably sprung and hydraulically damped driver's seat was positioned {{close to the}} door, to ease reversing. The seat had several {{ways in which it}} could be adjusted. Hanging pedals, which were set to the same level, became standard at an early stage. Vanaja's interior <b>heater,</b> which produced 9,000kcal/h, was possibly the most efficient available in lorries by the 1960s. Many Vanaja drivers valued the particularly soft suspension of the vehicles. Two-axle lorries were available in 4×2 and 4×4 layouts; the three-axle models were produced as 6×2, 6×4, 4×4+2 and 6×6.|$|E
5|$|According to a NASA document, Laika {{was placed}} in the capsule of the {{satellite}} on 31 October 1957—three days {{before the start of the}} mission. At that time of year, the temperatures at the launch site were extremely cold, and a hose connected to a <b>heater</b> was used to keep her container warm. Two assistants were assigned to keep a constant watch on Laika before launch. Just prior to liftoff on 3 November 1957, from Baikonur Cosmodrome, Laika's fur was sponged in a weak alcohol solution and carefully groomed, while iodine was painted onto the areas where sensors would be placed to monitor her bodily functions.|$|E

5|$|Before take-off, D'Mario placed three cloth-covered foam {{cushions}} {{on top of}} {{a heating}} vent under the instructor navigator's seat in the aft section of the lower deck. Shortly after take-off, another cushion was placed under the seat. The flight was uneventful until the scheduled mid-air refueling from a KC-135 Stratotanker, which had to be conducted manually because of an error with the B-52G's autopilot. About one hour after refueling, while the aircraft was circling above its designated area, Captain Haug directed co-pilot Svitenko to take his rest period. His seat was taken by the spare pilot, D'Mario. The crew was uncomfortable because of the cold, although the heater's rheostat was turned up, so D'Mario opened an engine bleed valve to draw additional hot air into the <b>heater</b> from the engine manifold. Because of a <b>heater</b> malfunction, the air barely cooled as it traveled from the engine manifold to the cabin's heating ducts. During the next half-hour, the cabin's temperature became uncomfortably hot, and the stowed cushions ignited. After one crew member reported smelling burning rubber, they looked for a fire. The navigator searched the lower compartment twice before discovering the fire behind a metal box. He attempted to fight it with two fire extinguishers, but could not put it out.|$|E
5|$|During {{periods of}} low demand gas {{is taken from}} the National Transmission System (NTS) at Beltoft, North Lincolnshire and {{transferred}} via a 12-inch diameter 15km pipeline to the Lindholme Compression Site. Here gas is heated in a water bath <b>heater</b> then through a pressure let-down skid and via a 16-inch 1.5km pipeline to the Hatfield Moor well site for injection into the reservoir for storage. The sandstone reservoir has a capacity of about 4.1 billion cubic feet (116 million cubic metres). During periods of high demand gas is withdrawn from the reservoir and through the 16-inch pipeline to the Lindholme site. Here the gas is dehydrated with glycol and compressed using a gas-turbine driven compressor to a pressure suitable for export to Beltoft and into the NTS.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rainfall}} {{from the}} typhoon breached a flood-retaining wall at Camp Fuji, a training facility for the United States Marine Corps near Yokosuka. Marines inside the camp weathered the storm inside huts {{situated at the}} base of a hill which housed a fuel farm. The breach led to hoses being dislodged from two rubber storage bladders, releasing large quantities of fuel. The fuel flowed down the hill and was ignited by a <b>heater</b> used to warm one of the huts. The resultant fire killed 13 Marines, injured 68, and caused moderate damage to the facility. The facility's barracks were destroyed, along with fifteen huts and several other structures. The barracks were rebuilt, and a memorial was established for those who lost their lives in the fire.|$|E
50|$|Electric heating or {{resistance}} heating converts electricity {{directly to}} heat. Electric heat {{is often more}} expensive than heat produced by combustion appliances like natural gas, propane, and oil. Electric resistance heat can be provided by baseboard <b>heaters,</b> space <b>heaters,</b> radiant <b>heaters,</b> furnaces, wall <b>heaters,</b> or thermal storage systems.|$|R
50|$|Small {{appliances}} {{are typically}} small household electrical machines,also very useful and easily carried and installed. Some are classified with white goods, and relate to {{heating and cooling}} such as: fans and window mounted air conditioners, and <b>heaters</b> such as space <b>heaters,</b> ceramic <b>heaters,</b> gas <b>heaters,</b> kerosene <b>heaters,</b> and fan <b>heaters.</b> Yet another category {{is used in the}} kitchen, including: juicers, electric mixers, meat grinders, coffee grinders, deep fryers, herb grinders, food processors, electric kettles, waffle irons, coffee makers, blenders and dough blenders, rice cookers, toasters and exhaust hoods.|$|R
50|$|The {{two primary}} health risks from <b>heaters</b> are {{the risk of}} fire {{and the risk of}} carbon {{monoxide}} poisoning. The latter risk applies to gas and kerosene <b>heaters</b> but not electric <b>heaters.</b> The risk of fire from <b>heaters</b> may be mitigated by low surface temperatures (as found on oil-filled convective <b>heaters),</b> or by switches that cut power in the event of the device inadvertently being tipped over (often found in the bases of halogen <b>heaters),</b> or by thermal cut-out switches. Natural Stone <b>Heaters</b> do not pose a fire or carbon monoxide poisoning risk, and can be a safer alternative. However, the surface temperatures of the stone <b>heaters</b> can be considerable, though they may not cause an instant burn as the heat transfer is slow. For that reason they are usually mounted high on walls or ceilings, away from the reach of infants.|$|R
5|$|A {{wind energy}} {{penetration}} figure {{can be specified}} for different duration of time, but is often quoted annually. To obtain 100% from wind annually requires substantial long term storage or substantial interconnection to other systems which may already have substantial storage. On a monthly, weekly, daily, or hourly basis—or less—wind might supply as much as or more than 100% of current use, with the rest stored or exported. Seasonal industry might then take advantage of high wind and low usage times such as at night when wind output can exceed normal demand. Such industry might include production of silicon, aluminum, steel, or of natural gas, and hydrogen, and using future long term storage to facilitate 100% energy from variable renewable energy. Homes can also be programmed to accept extra electric power on demand, for example by remotely turning up water <b>heater</b> thermostats.|$|E
5|$|After his {{accidental}} discovery, Reinitzer did {{not pursue}} studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who {{realized that he}} had encountered a new phenomenon and {{was in a position to}} investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a <b>heater)</b> enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the Zeitschrift für Physikalische Chemie.|$|E
5|$|More than 30 actresses were {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Esther. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet, a relative newcomer to film, was cast as Esther on May 16, 1958, after providing a 30-second silent screen test. Wyler had met her at the Cannes Film Festival, where she impressed him with her conversational skills and force of personality. Sam Jaffe was cast as Simonides on April 3, 1958, and Finlay Currie was cast as Balthasar on the same day. Wyler had to persuade Jack Hawkins to appear in the film, because Hawkins was unwilling to act in another epic motion picture so soon after The Bridge on the River Kwai. Hugh Griffith, who gained acclaim in the post-World War II era in Ealing Studios comedies, was cast as the colorful Sheik Ilderim. The role of Jesus was played by Claude <b>Heater</b> (uncredited), an American opera singer performing with the Vienna State Opera in Rome when he was asked to do a screen test for the film.|$|E

5|$|The {{first step}} in the {{manufacture}} of a typical shoe polish is the melting of the wax with the highest melting point in an electric <b>heater.</b> Following this, all other waxes are added, usually by descending order of melting point. While this wax is held at a constant temperature, the emulsion—a mixture of the various oils and, if used, fats, is then heated separately, at around 85°C. The heated emulsion is then added to the waxes, along with distilled water. When the mixture reaches around 80°C, turpentine oil is added. This mixture is then mixed and continually stirred for half an hour. Dyes are added and mixed in turpentine oil if it is not a neutral polish. The mixed mass is reduced slowly to 50°C, and as its viscosity increases, it is poured through a closed funnel into a cooling chamber. The poured mass is allowed to settle slowly, providing uniform distribution. The process is considered straightforward and the required equipment is relatively easy to acquire. The cost of establishing shoe polish manufacturing facilities has been estimated at around $600,000 (as of 2005).|$|E
5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the installation of new windows, {{the addition of a}} new <b>heater,</b> and the removal of partitions in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the installation of fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|E
25|$|For example, a {{temperature-controlled}} circulating bath has two PID controllers in cascade, {{each with}} its own thermocouple temperature sensor. The outer controller controls the temperature of the water using a thermocouple located far from the <b>heater</b> where it accurately reads the temperature of the bulk of the water. The error term of this PID controller is the difference between the desired bath temperature and measured temperature. Instead of controlling the <b>heater</b> directly, the outer PID controller sets a <b>heater</b> temperature goal for the inner PID controller. The inner PID controller controls the temperature of the <b>heater</b> using a thermocouple attached to the <b>heater.</b> The inner controller's error term is the difference between this <b>heater</b> temperature setpoint and the measured temperature of the <b>heater.</b> Its output controls the actual <b>heater</b> to stay near this setpoint.|$|E
5000|$|... industrially <b>heaters</b> of {{this type}} have an {{isolated}} heating element embedded in a glass fibre mat.

40|$|The U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) {{recently}} completed a rulemaking process in which it amended the existing energy efficiency standards for residential water <b>heaters.</b> A key factor in DOE?s consideration of new standards is the economic impacts on consumers.

This paper describes the method used to conduct the life-cycle cost (LCC) and payback period analysis for gas and electric storage water <b>heaters.</b> It presents the estimated change in LCC associated with more energy-efficient equipment, including heat pump electric water <b>heaters</b> and condensing gas water <b>heaters,</b> for a representative sample of U.

The study included a detailed accounting of installation costs for the considered design options, with a focus on approaches for accommodating the larger dimensions of more efficient water <b>heaters.</b> For heat pump water <b>heaters,</b> the study also considered airflow requirements, venting issues, and the impact of these products on the indoor environment. The results indicate that efficiency improvement relative to the baseline design reduces the LCC in the majority of homes for both gas and electric storage water <b>heaters,</b> and heat pump electric water <b>heaters</b> and condensing gas water <b>heaters</b> provide a lower LCC for homes with large rated volume water <b>heaters...</b>|$|R
25|$|A block <b>heater</b> warms {{the engine}} of an {{automobile}} in order to ease and speed starting and vehicle warm-up in cold weather. The most common type is an electric heating element connected through a power cord often routed through the vehicle's grille. The block <b>heater</b> may replace one of the engine's core plugs, or may be installed in line {{with one of the}} radiator or <b>heater</b> hoses. The block <b>heater,</b> first known as a head bolt <b>heater,</b> was invented in 1945 by Andrew Freeman in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Freeman used some scrap hoses and copper tubing onto the heating element of an old flat-iron and produced the first headbolt <b>heater,</b> which warmed the engine's water jacket and the oil film between cylinder heads and pistons. U.S. patent #2,487,326 was filed on November 4, 1946 and issued to Freeman on November 8, 1949.|$|E
25|$|A fan <b>heater,</b> {{also called}} a forced {{convection}} <b>heater,</b> is {{a variety of}} convection <b>heater</b> that includes an electric fan {{to speed up the}} airflow.

40|$|Natural gas is {{transferred}} in high pressure by piping system from refiners to city gate stations. For public consumption the gas pressure is reduced in gas pressure reducing stations. The pressure is reduced in regulators {{and leads to}} a sudden drop of temperature and consequently the formation of gas hydrates. Preventing hydrate formation, natural gas is heated by passing through water bath gas <b>heaters.</b> In this study, the thermodynamic efficiencies of water bath gas <b>heaters</b> were conducted. The effect of air-fuel ratio and the flow rate of the fuel on the efficiency of this instrument were studied. Also, the variations of efficiencies versus flame temperature have been considered and the optimum points in each state were obtained. From these comparisons, {{it can be concluded}} that, first law efficiency is suitable meanwhile second law efficiency is very low. The main reason of low second law efficiency is that high availability generation by fuel causes low enhancement in the availability of natural gas, passed through <b>heaters.</b> Also, one dimensional simulation has been employed to compute temperature distribution numerically in whole of a gas pressure reducing station with water bath gas <b>heaters</b> and with shell and tube <b>heaters</b> (inline <b>heaters).</b> Comparison between these two stations show that the gas pressure reducing station with inline <b>heaters</b> is more appropriate than the one with water bath gas <b>heaters.</b> Finally, water bath gas <b>heaters</b> and inline <b>heaters</b> have been studied economically by utilizing energy flow optimization model, EFOM. It is shown that the inline <b>heaters</b> have less cost of heat generation and they are more economical...|$|R
