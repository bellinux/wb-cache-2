2500|$|Describing {{the origins}} of Hawkman, Fox recalled, [...] "I was faced {{with the problem of}} filling a new book that {{publisher}} Max Gaines was starting... As I sat by the window <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> bird collecting twigs for a nest. The bird would swoop down, pick up the twig, and fly away. I thought, 'Wouldn't it be great if the bird was a lawman and the twig a crook!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|South Korea also {{refers to}} Ulleung-Do Sajuk (울릉도 사적). This work was {{compiled}} by Korean government officer Jang Han-sang (장한상; 張漢相) in 1696 after the An Yong-bok incident under {{orders from the}} Joseon kingdom. In it, he states that, from Ulleung-do, [...] "to the west can be seen the rugged mountains of Daegwallyeong; beholding the sea to the east, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> faint island in the jin (辰) direction (east-south-east), not {{more than one-third of}} the size of Ulleung, and not possibly more than 300 li (approximately 100km) away." [...] Furthermore, Jang also states in a later part of the work that [...] "I climbed to the peak of the island in order to see the boundaries of Japan, but no Japanese islands could be seen at all, and I cannot, therefore, fathom the distance to the border." [...] This evidence is used by South Korean experts to demonstrate that contemporary Koreans regarded this island to the south-east as under Korean control.|$|E
60|$|When he {{appeared}} at last in his real character, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> remarkable {{change in his}} behaviour.|$|E
60|$|Old Deleglise {{would not}} hear of it; but {{a week or}} two later <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>an</b> {{addition}} to old Deleglise's studio furniture {{in the shape of a}} handsome old carved cabinet twelve feet high.|$|R
60|$|At this moment, {{just when}} the dhow was yet quivering with the strain, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>an</b> {{expression}} of abject fear {{on the face of}} Ustâni. His dark countenance was positively blanched with horror, and his teeth chattered.|$|R
6000|$|... "The matter," [...] replied Andrew, [...] "cannot be {{dismissed}} in that way. Reasonable or not, I do undoubtedly experience sensations similar to Clarrie's. But in my love <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>a</b> distinct ebb and flow. There {{are times when}} I don't care a hang for her." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{looked at}} me more attentively, and <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> quick {{movement}} of her hands towards each other.|$|E
60|$|Feb. 10.--The first chirping, almost singing, {{of a bird}} to-day. Then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> {{couple of}} honey-bees spirting and humming about the open window in the sun.|$|E
60|$|Upon {{reaching}} the wharf, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> scythe and three spades, all apparently new, {{lying in the}} bottom of the boat in which we were to embark.|$|E
60|$|I thought <b>I</b> had <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> subtle {{change in}} the last two numbers.|$|R
60|$|Four {{days later}} I {{was in the}} club at the same hour, and again Major Selby entered. This time he walked with {{considerable}} difficulty, and <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>an</b> expression of pain and malaise upon his rubicund countenance. He ordered a whisky and soda from the servant, and then sat down near me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw nothing, your Highness," [...] Dick said humbly, [...] "save the tiger. That he was {{standing}} over <b>a</b> fallen figure <b>I</b> <b>noticed.</b> <b>As</b> soon as my eye fell on him I fired at once, and the second time {{as soon as the}} smoke cleared so that I could catch a glimpse of him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought it}} a large well-lighted room," [...] Mr. Rayburn answered. [...] "And <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> doorway in the wall, with a {{handsome}} curtain hanging over it." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{supposed}} she {{was thinking}} of the young gentleman who specialised in South American rails, for <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> ring on the third finger of her left hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was very}} simple; <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> hat and dress of hers which she owned she had made. The girl has some talent; I'm only sorry I can't keep her busy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Mr. Palliser {{was asking}} {{if you were}} up, sir, and they’re getting breakfast now,” he said, and then glanced at the clothes. “I’ve been giving them a brush. There was some mud on the trousers, and <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>a</b> seam split in the coat. I could ask one of the maids to put a stitch in it before it gets worse.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The soup we'll gladly eat," [...] {{said the}} {{corporal}} very pleasantly. [...] "As for shelter ... well! I {{am afraid that}} this nice warm coffee-room will not exactly serve our purpose. We want {{a place where we}} can lie hidden, {{and at the same time}} keep a watch on the road. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>an</b> outhouse as we came. By your leave we will sleep in there." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> that <b>a</b> big, blue-checked cloth {{was spread}} on the parapet before me, over the parapet of heaven. I {{wondered}} why it hung there.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was, {{as far as}} <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> <b>a</b> plain black gondola," [...] Francis said. [...] "The men {{concerned}} in {{the affair}} were all dressed in dark clothes, without any distinguishing badges." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> man {{bending over}} a chess-board, but {{could see only}} a large felt hat and a red beard. We {{threaded}} our way among the tables till we came to him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'In {{the fair}} maiden who {{sat at the}} organ,--a pretty girl, rather. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> sort of by-play going on between them occasionally, during the sermon, which meant mating, if I am not mistaken.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Tom {{lost his}} temper. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>a</b> person 'most always does that's got {{laid out in}} an argument. He told us to shut up, and maybe we'd feel better. Then he see a town clock away off down yonder, and he took up the glass and looked at it, and then looked at his silver turnip, {{and then at the}} clock, and then at the turnip again, and says: ...|$|R
60|$|At a London Committee meeting <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>a</b> {{middle-aged man}} who {{slips into the}} room for a moment, whispers {{something}} to the secretary, lays three or four shillings on a table, and slips out. I am told {{that he is an}} Irish board-school teacher who, in early life, took an oath neither to drink nor smoke, but to contribute the amount so saved weekly to the Irish Cause.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>a</b> {{tendency}} {{in the times}} that {{makes it harder for}} a married man to succeed than it used to be. I think, on the whole, my advice would be to keep out of it altogether. More men fail on that account, I observe, than upon any other. You see it's so infernally hard to tell what kind of a woman your girl is going to turn out." ...|$|R
60|$|He was {{so weak that}} he {{staggered}} as he approached me. Leading him to a chair, <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> wild look in his eyes, and a flush on his haggard cheeks. Something had happened.|$|E
60|$|While the {{pleasing}} {{tones of}} her voice were still ringing in my ears <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> puff of smoke rising from near my left toe. It came from the chimney of that house. Johnny.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{returned}} to the inn <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> man standing {{at the entrance of}} a driveway which appeared to lead back to the stable-yards. [...] "Here is some one who may talk," [...] I thought, and I stopped.|$|E
60|$|The {{four of us}} were at table, and it {{was very}} comfortable, in spite of the Elsinore's violent antics. The room was warm. The storm-racks on the table kept each dish in its place. The steward served and moved about with ease and {{apparent}} unconcern, although <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>an</b> occasional anxious gleam in his eyes when he poised some dish at a moment when the ship pitched and flung with unusual wildness.|$|R
60|$|Ambrose kicked sulkily at {{the loose}} stones lying about him. <b>I</b> <b>noticed,</b> with <b>a</b> certain {{surprise}} that his favorite stick {{was not in}} his hand, and was not lying near him.|$|R
3000|$|... and {{for every}} self-adjoint {{operator}} A and B on a Hilbert space H whose spectra are contained in <b>I.</b> <b>Notice</b> that <b>a</b> function f is operator concave if −f is operator convex.|$|R
60|$|I {{found him}} in his own apartments, and strangely disordered. He went to and fro, raving--beginning so soon as I entered the room. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> book half out of its cover, flung {{carelessly}} {{into the corner of}} the room.|$|E
60|$|At noon we dined in {{the house}} of the other brother, Mr. Edmund Sturge. Here <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> {{full-length}} engraving of Joseph Sturge. He is represented as standing with his hand placed protectingly on the head of a black child.|$|E
60|$|When we {{were out}} on the road by the brook Emily looked at me with shamefaced, {{laughing}} eyes. <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> small movement of her lips, and in an instant I found myself kissing her, laughing with some of the little woman's wildness.|$|E
6000|$|I am {{beginning}} {{to associate with}} actors. I detest them, {{but it is only}} in their company that I can feel I am not glaringly conspicuous. Their talk infects me. <b>I</b> <b>notice</b> <b>a</b> growing tendency to dramatic brevity, to dashes and pauses in my style, to a punctuation of bows and attitudes. Barnaby has remarked it too. I offended Wembly by calling him [...] "Dear Boy" [...] yesterday. I dread the end, but I cannot escape from it.|$|R
60|$|I got. And, {{like the}} old woman, I {{continued}} to get; for every time I dozed, a policeman was there to rout me along again. Not long after, when I had given this up, I was walking with a young Londoner (who had been out to the colonies and wished he were out to them again), when <b>I</b> <b>noticed</b> <b>an</b> open passage leading under a building and disappearing in darkness. A low iron gate barred the entrance.|$|R
60|$|One {{can always}} know at once whether {{a man has}} home claims upon his life or not. <b>I</b> have <b>noticed</b> <b>a</b> very, very sad {{expression}} {{in the eyes of}} so many married men.|$|R
