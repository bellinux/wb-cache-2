500|$|Azaria played Gargamel in the computer-animated/live-action {{adaptation}} of The Smurfs (2011). Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, buck teeth, eyebrows and a wig, {{as well as}} shaving his head. He spent approximately 130 hours in the make-up chair {{over the course of}} the production. Azaria considered Gargamel's voice to be the most important part of his performance. The producers wanted an [...] "old, failed, Shakespearean actor" [...] voice, but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European. He eventually selected a voice similar to that of Paul Winchell's from the cartoon. Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired, and considered Gargamel too one-dimensional a character and [...] "just this straight villain"; he opted to make Gargamel [...] "more sarcastic" [...] than in the cartoon, but [...] "discovered that there's no way to play Gargamel without screaming your head off at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs". He interpreted him as [...] "very lonely", adding that [...] "he hates the Smurfs because they're such a happy family. He wants in really badly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to be embraced as a Smurf". Azaria worked with the writers to [...] "infuse" [...] the script with some of his ideas about the character, [...] "particularly with the 'married' relationship between Gargamel and [...] Azreal [...] " [...] which Azaria conceived.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Criss as Blaine, a gay {{member of}} a rival glee club, the Dalton Academy Warblers. In September 2010, a casting call was released for an actor to portray a [...] "cute, charismatic, gay high school junior" [...] who would lead a competing glee club. Criss had auditioned for Glee several times before, once {{for the role of}} Finn Hudson. The character breakdown for Blaine was the first he believed he had a chance of securing, and indeed his audition was successful. Blaine was introduced primarily as a mentor to Kurt. Criss explained, [...] "At this point, Kurt's [...] has been such a sense of discord in his life. Blaine finds [...] empowering. He embraces who he is, and sees Kurt [...] the same things that he had to deal with, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to impart that knowledge." [...] Murphy described Blaine as a character with [...] "great self-loathing" [...] and regret for having run away from his own tormentors; he intended this to form part of his story arc for the season, as Blaine tries to set right some past mistakes. Neither he nor Criss knew whether Blaine would eventually become Kurt's boyfriend—a role originally intended for new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) until the producers decided to change Sam to heterosexual and paired him with Quinn—but based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy later decided to pair them romantically.|$|E

6000|$|... "Leslie {{passed her}} up the gangway," [...] said another man, adding, with a suggestive laugh as he {{answered}} another question: [...] "Why did he do it?

60|$|January 12.--Mathews {{last night}} {{gave us a}} very perfect {{imitation}} of old Cumberland, who carried the poetic jealousy and irritability further than any man I ever saw. He was a great flatterer too, the old rogue. Will Erskine used to admire him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> originality. A very high-bred man in point of manners in society.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Winters, whom I shall always hate for it, {{has been}} telling that at some battle in Virginia, where he got his hurt, you were seen {{crouching}} behind a tree. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to injure you in my regard, which he knows the story would do if I believed it.

6000|$|... "Personally," [...] {{she told}} him, [...] "I {{believe that it}} is just the call of England to a man who lived very near the soil--her heart. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> the smell of spring flowers, the stillness of an English autumn, the winds of February in the woods he was brought up in. It is a form of heart-sickness, you know. I have felt it myself so often. It is {{scarcely}} possible that after all these years he is still nursing that bitter hatred of us both." ...|$|E

5000|$|In September 2014, it was {{announced}} that Coronation Street producers had signed up former Emmerdale and Bad Girls star Claire King for a guest stint as Erica Holroyd. It was revealed that the newcomer's arrival leads to some happier times for Nick as Erica immediately sets her sights on him, leading to a fling between the pair. Producer Stuart Blackburn said: [...] "Erica is a woman who lives life to the full. Nick doesn't stand a chance once she has set her sights on him, but he's not complaining." [...] Speaking about the storyline for the first time, Price said: [...] "He's copped a stunner - I think {{he is going to have}} the best time of his life. He has had a depressing few years so I think this is great for him, really. I think he is just enjoying the moment - she is perfect for him at the minute. She's light, funny, has been around a bit and she is an adult about things. He has still got issues so he is not looking for anything serious. I think he is still struggling with himself and how he feels, so I think he just wants a laugh and a bit of fun." [...] Price also revealed that he doesn't think Nick is ready for a long term relationship at the moment saying; [...] "I think he needs a bit of time a new relationship especially after Leanne has come back to the Bistro," [...] Price said. [...] "It's great - he has seen what he has lost now but he is not the guy he was, so it will take a while to get back, I think." [...] Praising the pairing, King revealed that Erica and Nick work well together as neither of them wants anything more serious; [...] "Erica wants it to be a fling and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> the same, but she's worried because it's New Year's Eve and she has to tell him that, not knowing how he really feels, Luckily he's thinking the same so it's quite a good little catch. She continued: [...] "Perhaps because she's more mature and not a kid, she can handle just being friends with benefits. I think he's quite capable of doing that and enjoys having her around - she brings him out of his shell as well as his suits. It has been really good for both of them, so they possibly could just go on and there wouldn't be any jealousy and negative things you can get with someone that is a bit younger. They are both mature enough to handle it and to enjoy themselves sexually too." [...] In April 2015, it was revealed that Nick would be given a huge surprise when Erica arrived back in Weatherfield and tells Nick that she is pregnant with his baby. Speaking of Nick's reaction to the pregnancy, Price said; [...] "He's supposed to meet Carla and Erica puts her hands over his eyes which makes it a bit awkward, because he thinks she's Carla. Then he thinks great, she's a mate. When he finds out she's pregnant, it's very tricky for him. Not that he'd run away because he's always wanted a kid - it's just not the best situation. It's a shock! His reaction is that he's shocked, but he's there for her. They may not be a couple but he's there for her and she just needs to tell him what she needs. He's very practical about it." [...] Asked if Erica wants them to bring up the baby together as a couple, Price answered; [...] "No, she doesn't want them to be a couple. She's absolutely cool about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|On January 20, 2010, Franz Nicolay {{confirmed}} on {{his official}} website {{that he had}} left the band. Regarding his departure, vocalist and guitarist Craig Finn stated: [...] "Franz is a real ambitious guy, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to do a lot of}} different things, and we want to really follow this one Hold Steady thing to its logical end. And it takes up a lot of time. It was an amicable departure, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we all wish him the best. He’ll do a lot of interesting, cool things." ...|$|R
5000|$|Steve Gerber came {{on board}} with issue #97, {{initially}} scripting over Conway's plots, but Gene Colan's long stint as Daredevil's penciler {{had come to an}} end. Gerber recollected, [...] "Gene and I did a few issues together, but Gene was basically trying to move on at that point. He'd just started the Dracula book, and he'd been doing Daredevil for God knows how many years. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to do something else." [...] After six issues with fill-in pencilers, including several with Don Heck, Bob Brown took over as penciller.|$|R

5000|$|Andrew Clements of The Guardian said it [...] "ranks {{alongside}} Ligeti's utterly different concerto as {{the most}} important for piano and orchestra since Bartók." [...] The pianists Leif Ove Andsnes and Louis Lortie have similarly considered it {{to be one of the}} great piano concertos of the late 20th century. [...] Lortie said of the piece, [...] "I like it because Lutoslawski isn't trying to go against the nature of the instrument, the way some modern composers do. Lutoslawski was a fine pianist himself, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to create something he himself would enjoy playing." ...|$|R
6000|$|I heard Cavor's {{voice in}} alarm and entreaty. Even then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{compromise}} with these creatures. [...] "I say, Bedford," [...] he cried, [...] "I know a way!" [...] But {{the sting of}} that second stab seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy in my being. Instantly the link of the wrist-chain snapped, and with it snapped all considerations that had held us unresisting {{in the hands of}} these moon creatures. For that second, at least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of consequences. I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the goad. The chain was twisted round my fist.|$|R
60|$|The {{next night}} he came again. I should {{say he was}} a bird {{with a sense of}} humour. Thinking this might happen, I had, however, taken the {{precaution}} to have a few stones ready. I opened the window wide, and fired them one after another into the tree. After I had closed the window, he hopped down nearer, and cawed louder than ever. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> me to throw more stones at him: he appeared to regard the whole proceeding as a game. On the third night, as I heard nothing of him, I flattered myself that, in spite of his bravado, I had discouraged him. I might have known rooks better.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll reach Echo Lodge {{before the}} rain gets very heavy, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Anyway, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to go back}} tonight. Well, I've had a splendid visit, but I'm {{glad to see you}} dear folks again. 'East, west, hame's best.' Davy, have you been growing again lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> outside now. <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> what <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> Would you--would {{you mind}} being {{kind enough to}} go and send him away?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jacobs was {{not sure}} that Marcia left her home to deliver cookies to Marie Maxwell. He {{suggested}} {{she might have been}} planning to meet up with Womack. Jacobs said he thought that someone Marcia knew lured her into the garage. He did not know if it was Womack or just an [...] "adolescent teenager with his hormones blitzing." [...] "The suspect just raped someone. It was probably a new experience for him, and it was a new experience for Marcia. It was a tense situation. Marcia screamed. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> the perpetrator wanted to kill her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to gain control of her and make her be quiet." [...] In contrast to Miller (his former boss), Jacobs did not believe that Marcia was sexually assaulted by more than one person.|$|R
5000|$|Chamberlain {{wanted to}} veer the music towards a more pop-oriented {{direction}} while Thompson opted {{to keep the}} sound experimental. As Thompson explained, [...] "there wasn't much for him to do, in a way, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to say what he}} felt about the record, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it closer in the direction of pop, because Jesse, that's always been one of his gifts, and I was determined to make the record work, and thought that it could, and should, and working with Geoff Travis, using his insights into the way music works, {{there was no other way}} it could be..." [...] The conflict of interest caused a strain on their musical partnership, although they later worked again on another record in a similar vein, Three Songs on a Trip to America, the cover of which referenced Soldier-Talk.|$|R
5000|$|More than 30 years on, TVNZ's Sunday {{programme}} {{tracked down}} the French spy who planted the bombs. Jean Camas, who {{retired from the}} DGSE in about 2000, confessed to planting both bombs on the hull of the ship. After the bombing on 10 July, Camas, using the alias Jacques Camurier, and several others posed as tourists, and took a ferry to the South Island, went skiing at Mt Hutt, and then left the country using false documents about 10 days later. Reporter John Hudson, who spent two days with Camas in France, said that Camas [...] "wanted {{an opportunity to talk}} about his role in the bombing... It has been on his conscience for 30 years. He said to us, 'secret agents don't talk', but <b>he</b> is talking. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be understood." [...] Camas considered the mission [...] "a big, big failure".|$|R

You know, I guess, take care of each other. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> would <b>want</b> us to take care of each other." ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2012, Dylan {{commented on}} I'm Not There in an {{interview}} published in Rolling Stone. When journalist Mikal Gilmore asked Dylan whether he liked the film, he responded: [...] "Yeah, I {{thought it was all}} right. Do you think that the director was worried that people would understand it or not? <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> cared one bit. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to make a good movie.
