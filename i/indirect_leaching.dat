The correlation between pyrite biooxidation and adhesion of Leptospirillum spp. bacteria on mineral surface has been found. It has been revealed that in case of mixed culture the cells of Leptospirillum sp. str. ZC are adhered on pyrite surface only after its initial colonization by sulfur oxidizing bacteria.

30|$|In this study, {{only the}} {{performance}} of the supernatant in metal leaching was investigated. This is also referred to <b>indirect</b> or two-step <b>leaching</b> compared to direct or one-step leaching by using microbial cells (Brandl et al. 2001). This approach considered the difficulty in separating cells from residual fly ash. In particular, if fungi are used, leached metals are often adsorbed to or enclosed by the fungal mycelium (Jain and Sharma 2004) (Hopfe et al. 2017), which makes separating residual solid substrates from fungal biomass nearly impossible. Thus, for the three heterotrophic microorganisms, the strategy we used was to grow the microbes first and then use the metabolites in the supernatant for quantitative leaching.|$|R

After the deposition of only few polyelectrolyte layers, {{the skin of the}} fruits was changed from hydrophobic to hydrophilic as shown by contact angles measurements decreasing from 90 ° to 10 °. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to confirm the deposition of the PEM coating on the fruit which was then used as a matrix to load curcumin as model compound.

30|$|Coal fly ash {{originated}} from coal combustion has {{high concentrations of}} metals. If suitable leaching techniques are identified, then coal fly ash {{could serve as a}} useful source of valuable minerals including rare earth elements (REEs). In this study, three microbial strains, Candida bombicola, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Cryptococcus curvatus were tested on their performance of leaching trace elements and REEs from fly ash. Through comparing mineral loss and leaching efficiencies resulting from <b>indirect</b> <b>leaching</b> or use of the culture supernatant, C. bombicola was identified to be the best leading to the highest mineral loss and extracting efficiencies of trace elements and REEs among the three strains. The highest mineral loss observed from using the supernatant of this yeast strain was 59.7 %. Among all trace elements, As and Mo had the highest leaching efficiency of 80.9 % and 79.5 %, respectively. The same leaching test led to 67.7 % of Yb and 64.6 % of Er dissolved from the ash. This study, thus, demonstrated that bioleaching is feasible for leaching metals out of fly ash. The C. bombicola strain deserves further investigation due to its robust actions on metal leaching.|$|E
40|$|A semiempirical {{model for}} {{bacterial}} growth and bioleaching of Acidithiobacillus spp. was developed {{based on the}} concept of transport phenomena. Only one mathematical equation and three parameters evaluated from the experimental data are required to describe the complicated bioleaching process, regardless of the source and concentration of the microorganism, the concentration, composition, and physical characteristics (particle size, shape, distribution, and porosity, etc.) of the solid substrate, the concentrations of the leaching products and byproducts, and the leaching conditions (pH, temperature, agitation, etc.). In order to evaluate the semiempirical model, five kinetic models proposed previously were compared. The results of mean deviations show that our model fits their experimental data explicitly well, even better than the corresponding models. Furthermore, the semiempirical model can be successfully used to predict the bacterial growth and bioleaching behaviors in different leaching systems, i. e. direct, indirect, direct and <b>indirect,</b> and simultaneous <b>leaching...</b>|$|R
40|$|Experiments on the {{leaching}} {{of copper}} from chalcopyrite mineral by the bacterium Thiobacillus ferrooxidans show that, {{in the presence}} of adequate amounts of sulphide, iron-grown bacteria preferentially oxidise sulphur in the ore (through direct attachment) rather than ferrous sulphate in solution. At 20 % pulp density, the leaching initially takes place by a predominantly direct mechanism. The cell density in the liquid phase increases, but the Fe 2 + is not oxidised. However, in the later stages when less solid substrate is available and the cell density becomes very high, the bacteria start oxidising Fe 2 + in the liquid phase, thus contributing to the <b>indirect</b> mechanism of <b>leaching.</b> Contrary to expectations, the rate of leaching increased with increasing particle size in spite of the decreasing specific surface area.

40|$|Calcium {{and iron}} removal from a bauxite ore by Bacillus polymyxa has been demonstrated. Within {{a period of}} 7 days, the above {{organism}} could remove all the calcium and about 45 % of iron from the ore {{in the presence of}} 2 % sucrose in a Bromfield medium. The highest removal of calcium and iron corresponded with the maximum in extracellular polysaccharide production by the organism. Scanning electron microscopy of the biobeneficiated bauxite surfaces indicated tenacious attachment of the bacteria onto the ore particle. Some calcium and iron removal was observed even in the presence of bacterial metabolites such as polysaccharides, organic acids and slime. However, the calcium removal in the absence of microorganism (by metabolites alone) was found to be 50 % of that obtained in its presence. These observations clearly indicate that both a direct mechanism through bacterial attachment to the ore and an <b>indirect</b> mechanism through <b>leaching</b> with metabolites are involved in the biobeneficiation proces...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} some of {{the important}} microbiological and engineering challenges in scaling up biobeneficiation of bauxite. A soil bacterium Paenibacillus polymyxa was recently shown to selectively remove calcium and iron impurities from low grade bauxite (< 50 % Al), for abrasive and refractory applications, respectively. An industrial scale formulation of Bromfield medium (called ISF- 2), based on cane sugar and tap/mine water, is developed to successfully culture P. polymyxa under septic conditions. The culture {{is found to be}} efficient in removing calcium from bauxite ore, carried out as cascade operations in total recycle slurry reactors. In cascade leaching experiments with pre-grown culture, calcium removal was observed to occur solely by indirect mechanism in an initial rapid phase lasting few minutes, followed by a gradual phase comprising of direct attack as well as indirect mechanisms. An alternative mechanism of <b>indirect</b> <b>leaching</b> is proposed based on solubilisation of accessible calcium in the culture metabolite, up to a saturation solubility limit. The saturation solubility theory gives an explanation for the need to perform cascade experiments, and also successfully predicts the possibility of pulse leaching experiments. Some of these recent advances are likely to enable successful commercialisation of bauxite biobeneficiation...|$|E
40|$|The {{importance}} of Leptospirillum ferrooxidans for leach processes has been evaluated {{by studying the}} lithotrophic flora of three mine biotopes and a heap leaching operation, by percolation experiments with inoculated, sterilized ore, and by morphological, physiological, and genetic investigations of pure and mixed cultures of L. ferrooxidans, Thiobacillus ferrooxidans, and Thiobacillus thiooxidans. In biotopes of 20 °C or above, Leptospirillum-like bacteria are as abundant as T. ferrooxidans. Leptospirilli represent at least one-half of the ferrous-iron-oxidizing population. Percolation experiments confirmed this result. Leptospirilli were as numerous as T. ferrooxidans. At reduced temperatures, the generation times of leptospirilli increase more so than those of T. ferrooxidans. At 14 °C, Leptospirillum grows slowly and T. ferrooxidans dominates the population. Physiological investigations indicate that L. ferrooxidans is a strict chemolithoautotroph, metabolizing only ferrous iron and pyrite. Even an addition of 0. 05 % (wt/vol) yeast extract inhibited its growth. The maximum ferrous-iron-oxidizing activity of L. ferrooxidans amounts to about 40 % of the activity of T. ferrooxidans. After growth on sulfidic ore, both species exhibit reduced iron-oxidizing activities, L. ferrooxidans exhibiting one-third and T. ferrooxidans exhibiting one-seventh of their maximum activities. Surprisingly, the absolute values are similar. For <b>indirect</b> <b>leaching,</b> L. ferrooxidans {{is as important as}} T. ferrooxidans. This was confirmed by the results of percolation experiments. L. ferrooxidans together with T. thiooxidans mobilized metals at least as well as T. ferrooxidans did.

40|$|Recent {{increases}} in nitrate {{concentrations in the}} Suwannee River and associated springs in northern Florida have raised concerns over the contributions of non-point sources. The Middle Suwannee River Basin (MSRB) is of special concern because of prevalent karst topography, unconfined aquifers and sandy soils which increase vulnerability of the ground water contamination from agricultural operations [...] a billion dollar industry in this region. Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production poses a challenge in the area due to the shallow root system of potato plants, and low water and nutrient holding capacity of the sandy soils. A four-year monitoring study for potato production on sandy soil was conducted on a commercial farm located in the MSRB to identify major nitrogen (N) loss pathways and determine their contribution to the total environmental N load, using a partial N budget approach and the potato model SUBSTOR. Model simulated environmental N loading rates were found to lie within one standard deviation of the observed values and identified leaching loss of N as the major sink representing 25 to 38 % (or 85 to 138 kg ha(- 1) N) of the total input N (310 to 349 kg ha(- 1) N). The crop residues left in the field after tuber harvest represented {{a significant amount of}} N (64 to 110 kg ha(- 1) N) and posed potential for <b>indirect</b> <b>leaching</b> loss of N upon their mineralization and the absence of subsequent cover crops. Typically, two months of fallow period exits between harvest of tubers and planting of the fall row crop (silage corn). The fallow period is characterized by summer rains which pose a threat to N released from rapidly mineralizing potato vines. Strategies to reduce N loading into the groundwater from potato production must focus on development and adoption of best management practices aimed on reducing direct as well as indirect N leaching losses...|$|E

Realgar {{is one of the}} most abundant arsenic sulphide minerals and usually treated as waste in industry. The aim of the present study was to screen an arsenic tolerant bacterium used for bioleaching arsenic from realgar. Results: An acidophilic iron-oxidizing bacterium BYQ- 12 was isolated from Wudalianchi volcanic lake in northeast China. BYQ- 12 was a motile, rod-shaped gram-negative bacterium with an optimum growth at 30 °C and pH  2. 5. 16 S rDNA phylogeny showed that BYQ- 12 was a new strain of Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans. The inhibitory concentrations (ICs) of arsenite and arsenate were 32 and 64  mM, respectively. A significant second-order model was established using a Box–Behnken design of response surface methodology (BBD-RSM) and it estimated that a maximum arsenic bioleaching rate (73. 97 %) could be obtained when the pulp concentration, pH and initial ferrous ion concentration were set at optimized values of 0. 95 % w/v, 1. 74 and 3. 68  g/L, respectively. SEM, EDS and XRD analyses also revealed that there was direct bioleaching besides <b>indirect</b> electrochemical <b>leaching</b> in the arsenic bioleaching system. Conclusion: From this work we were successful in isolating an acidophilic, arsenic tolerant ferrous iron-oxidizing bacterium. The BBD-RSM analysis showed that maximum arsenic bioleaching rate obtained under optimum conditions, and the most effective factor for arsenic leaching was initial ferrous ion concentration. These revealed that BYQ- 12 could be used for bioleaching of arsenic from arsenical minerals...|$|R
50|$|Phthalates {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of common products, and are {{released}} into the environment. There is no covalent bond between the phthalates and plastics; rather, they are entangled within the plastic as a result of the manufacturing process used to make PVC articles. They can be removed by exposure to heat or with organic solvents. Due to the ubiquity of plastics (and therefore plasticizers) in modern life, the vast majority of people are exposed to some level of phthalates, and most Americans tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have metabolites of multiple phthalates in their urine. Phthalate exposure may be through direct use or by <b>indirect</b> means through <b>leaching</b> and general environmental contamination. Diet is believed to be the main source of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and other phthalates in the general population. Fatty foods such as milk, butter, and meats are a major source.

40|$|Although {{bacterial}} leaching of sulphidic minerals {{is a well-known}} phenomenon, {{it is only in}} the last ten years that full-scale {{bacterial leaching}} plants have been commissioned for gold processing. In order for bacterial leaching to compete successfully with other pretreatment processes for refractory ores, particularly with established technologies such as roasting and pressure leaching, it needs to be efficient. This requires the optimization of the parameters affecting the leaching reaction and the growth of bacteria. The entire biotreatment process is agitation leaching, carried out in stirred reactors or Pachuca type reactors. The bacterial oxidation is a complex reaction involving gaseous, liquid and solid phases. The interactions are highly complex, and analysis is complicated by the presence of solids in the leaching medium. Inspite of the amount of research that has been performed, kinetic and process models are underdeveloped. Since kinetic data varies widely with the type and source of concentrate, experimental data should be generated before doing the full-scale reactor design. In sizing reactors for a commercial scale process, it would be useful to have a mathematical model that one could use to predict the amount and rate of release of metal, as a function of the various operating parameters of the system. G. R. Halli arsenical gold sulphide concentrate obtained from Hutti Gold Mines Ltd., Karnataka, was chosen for our study, because of its high refractoriness. An indegenous strain of Thiobacillus ferrooxidans was used for biooxidation. The experiments were conducted in a well-agitated stirred tank reactor under controlled conditions. Sparged air was supplemented with carbon-dioxide for optimized growth. In this work, more than 90 % gold and 95 % silver could be recovered from the sulphidic gold concentrate when bioleaching was used ahead of cyanidation, compared to 40 % and 50 % by direct cyanidation. A generalized model, which accounts for both direct bacterial attack and <b>indirect</b> chemical <b>leaching,</b> has been proposed for the biooxidation of refractory gold concentrates. The bacterial balance, therefore, accounts for its growth both on solid substrate and in solution, and for the attachment to and detachment from the surface. The overall process is considered to consist of several sub-processes, each of which can be described in terms of a mechanism and related rate expressions. These sub-processes were studied seperately under kinetically controlled conditions. The key parameters appearing in the rate equations were evaluated using the experimental data. Since the refractory concentrate contains pyrite and arsenopyrite as the major leachable entities, leaching studies have been done on pure pyrite and arsenopyrite as test minerals and the key parameters in the rate equations are evaluated using this data. The model so developed is tested with the leaching kinetics of the concentrate. The growth of bacteria is dependent on the availability of the substrate, ferrous iron, and the dependence is modelled by the widely accepted Monod equation. The effect of carbon dioxide supplementation on the bacterial activity was studied and the optimal concentration for growth was found to be l%(v/v). Studies on <b>indirect</b> chemical <b>leaching</b> showed that the rate is sensitive to surface area of concentrate. Indirect rate constant of arsenopyrite was found to be greater than that of pyrite, since pyrite is more nobler than arsenopyrite. Conditions of direct leaching alone was obtained at high pulp density and using substrate adapted bacteria. The rate constant of arsenopyrite was found to be greater than that of pyrite. The parameters obtained were tested with the overall batch leaching data of the concentrate and favourable comparision was obtained. Thus, it has been possible to isolate the various simultaneous sub-processes occurring during the leaching and propose useful models to describe these processes in some detail. The model has been extended successfully to predict the continuous leaching behaviour using the parameters obtained from the batch data. Studies on the effect of residence time and pulp density on steady state behaviour showed that there is a critical residence time and pulp density below which washout conditions occur. The critical residence time at 10 % pulp density was found to be 11 hrs. Operation at pulp densities lower than 5 % and residence times lower than 72 hrs is not favourable for efficient leaching. Studies on the effect of initial ferric iron concentration showed that there exists an optimum concentration of ferric iron at which the time required to reach steady state is minimum...|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{screening}} of the mine water sample from bauxite ore deposits in Jamnagar, India showed the presence of heterotrophic bacteria B. polymyxa. Growth conditions for the bacteria to bring about max. beneficiation were standardized by using the enriched Bromfield medium. B. polymyxa brought {{significant changes in the}} surface modifications of the mineral magnetite. The interaction resulted in surface chem. changes both on the cell and on the mineral surface by studying their electrophoretic mobility using Zeta meter 3. 0. Dissoln. studies in the presence of microorganisms establish the foundation in which these processes could be used for the utility of beneficiation in the efficient sepn. of the impurities from the ore, thus confirmed that B. polymyxa has greater affinity towards magnetite and could be efficiently used to remove iron from magnetite. Expts. with respect to the bauxite ore was initiated after confirming the above result. Iron removal from bauxite ore by B. polymyxa has been demonstrated under 2 ​% sucrose concns. brought about 12. 5 ​% removals in four days and under similar conditions the control in absence of B. polymyxa only 6 ​% iron removal was seen. Thus, B. polymyxa plays a significant role in biobenficiation of bauxite mineral. These observations clearly indicate that a direct mechanism through bacterial attachment to the ore and an <b>indirect</b> mechanism through <b>leaching</b> with metabolites are involved in the biobeneficiation process...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Red-billed quelea (Quelea quelea) are {{controlled}} at breeding colonies and roosts by organophosphate sprays or explosions. Contamination with organophosphates after sprays and with petroleum products and phthalates after explosions was assessed. RESULTS: Concentrations in {{soil of the}} organophosphate fenthion the day after sprays were uneven (0 – 29. 5 μg g− 1), which was attributable to excess depositions at vehicle turning points, incorrect positioning of nozzles and poor equipmentmaintenance. A laboratory study using field-collected samples provided an estimate of 47 days for the half-life of fenthion. After sprays,fenthion persisted in soil for up to 188 days. High concentrations were detected 5 months after negative results at the same sites, providing <b>indirect</b> evidence of <b>leaching.</b> Concentrations of total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPHs) and phthalates ranged from 0. 05 to 130. 81 (mean 18. 69) μg g− 1 and from 0 to 1. 62 (mean 0. 55) μg g− 1 respectively in the craters formed by the explosions, but declined to means of 0. 753 and 0. 027 μg g− 1 at 10 m away. One year after an explosion, mean TPHs of 0. 865 and mean phthalates of 0. 609 were detected. CONCLUSION: Localisation of high concentrations of fenthion likely to have effects on soil biota could be mitigated by improved spray management. Given a half-life in the soil of 47 days for fenthion {{and the possibility of}} its leaching months after applications raises concerns about its acceptability.

40|$|Veterinary {{medicines}} (VMs) from {{agricultural industry}} {{can enter the}} environment {{in a number of}} ways. This includes direct exposure through aquaculture, accidental spillage and disposal, and <b>indirect</b> entry by <b>leaching</b> from manure or runoff after treatment. Many compounds used in animal treatments have ecotoxic properties that may have chronic or sometimes lethal effects when they come into contact with non-target organisms. VMs enter the environment in mixtures, potentially having additive effects. Traditional ecotoxicology tests are used to determine the lethal and sometimes reproductive effects on freshwater and terrestrial organisms. However, organisms used in ecotoxicology tests can be unrepresentative of the populations that are likely to be exposed to the compound in the environment. Most often the tests are on single compound toxicity but mixture effects may be significant and should be included in ecotoxicology testing. This work investigates the use, measured environmental concentrations (MECs) and potential impact of sea lice treatments on salmon farms in Scotland. Alternative methods for ecotoxicology testing including mixture toxicity, and the use of in silico techniques to predict the chronic impact of VMs on different species of aquatic organisms were also investigated. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) provided information on the use of five sea lice treatments from 2008 - 2011 on Scottish salmon farms. This information was combined with the recently available data on sediment MECs for the years 2009 - 2012 provided by SEPA using ArcGIS 10. 1. In depth analysis of this data showed that from a total of 55 sites, 30 sites had a MEC higher than the maximum allowable concentration (MAC) as set out by SEPA for emamectin benzoate and 7 sites had a higher MEC than MAC for teflubenzuron. A number of sites that were up to 16 km away from the nearest salmon farm reported as using either emamectin benzoate or teflubenzuron measured positive for the two treatments. There was no relationship between current direction and the distribution of the sea lice treatments, nor was there any evidence for alternative sources of the compounds e. g. land treatments. The sites that had MECs higher than the MAC could pose a risk to non-target organisms and disrupt the species dynamics of the area. There was evidence that some marine protected sites might be at risk of exposure to these compounds. To complement this work, effects on acute mixture toxicity of the 5 sea lice treatments, plus one major metabolite 3 -phenoxybenzoic acid (3 PBA), were measured using an assay using the bioluminescent bacteria Aliivibrio fischeri. When exposed to the 5 sea lice treatments and 3 PBA A. fischeri showed a response to 3 PBA, emamectin benzoate and azamethiphos as well as combinations of the three. In order to establish any additive effect of the sea lice treatments, the efficacy of two mixture prediction equations, concentration addition (CA) and independent action ii(IA) were tested using the results from single compound dose response curves. In this instance IA was the more effective prediction method with a linear regression confidence interval of 82. 6 % compared with 22. 6 % of CA. In silico molecular docking was carried out to predict the chronic effects of 15 VMs (including the five used as sea lice control). Molecular docking has been proposed as an alternative screening method for the chronic effects of large animal treatments on non-target organisms. Oestrogen receptor alpha (ERα) of 7 non-target bony fish and the African clawed frog Xenopus laevis were modelled using SwissModel. These models were then ‘docked’ to oestradiol, the synthetic oestrogen ethinylestradiol, two known xenoestrogens dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and bisphenol A (BPA), the antioestrogen breast cancer treatment tamoxifen and 15 VMs using Auto Dock 4. Based on the results of this work, four VMs were identified as being possible xenoestrogens or anti-oestrogens; these were cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenbendazole and teflubenzuron. Further investigation, using in vitro assays, into these four VMs has been suggested as future work. A modified recombinant yeast oestrogen screen (YES) was attempted using the cDNA of the ERα of the zebrafish Danio rerio and the rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. Due to time and difficulties in cloning protocols this work was unable to be completed. Use of such in vitro assays would allow for further investigation of the highlighted VMs into their oestrogenic potential. In conclusion, VMs used as sea lice treatments, such as teflubenzuron and emamectin benzoate may be more persistent and have a wider range in the environment than previously thought. Mixtures of sea lice treatments have been found to persist together in the environment, and effects of these mixtures on the bacteria A. fischeri can be predicted using the IA equation. Finally, molecular docking may be a suitable tool to predict chronic endocrine disrupting effects and identify varying degrees of impact on the ERα of nine species of aquatic organisms...|$|R
