60|$|His {{reflections}} were disturbed. A fowl, cackling in wild alarm, {{came down}} the ventilator shaft that pierced the ceiling of his small room. It struck the rack above the folding washstand, and Kit's hairbrush {{and a box of}} brass buttons fell. The buttons rolled about the floor and under his berth. Then the fowl swept his desk with fluttering wings and the inkpot overturned. Kit frowned and put his letter in the envelope. His friends on board liked a rude joke, and a fowl had come down the shaft before. Kit had thought he had spoiled the joke by painting the inside of the bowl-head on deck, but the paint did not long <b>keep</b> <b>wet.</b> He tried to catch the fowl, with the object of putting it in Macallister's bed, and finding he could not, opened the door, and drove it out. Soon afterward Macallister came in and indicated the stained desk.|$|E

30|$|The hydride {{electrodes}} {{were prepared}} by mixing 0.3  g alloy powder (200 mesh) with 1.2  g carbonyl nickel powder. The mixture was then cold-pressed under a pressure of 20  MPa into a pallet of 15  mm {{in diameter and}} 1  mm in thickness. The prepared pellet, together with a Ni strip soldered on the surface, was inserted into folded current collector Ni foam, and the rims of the wrapped pellet were firmly spot-welded to keep the electrochemical contact well between the pellet, Ni strip, and Ni foam. The electrodes were immersed in 6  M KOH solution for 24  h to <b>keep</b> <b>wet</b> thoroughly before the tests. Electrochemical measurements were performed at 303  K in a standard three-electrode open cell consisting of a working electrode (hydride electrode), a sintered Ni(OH) 2 /NiOOH counter electrode with excess capacity, and a Hg/HgO reference electrode immersed in 6  M KOH electrolyte. The emphasis of these measurements was on the electrochemical properties of the working electrode, and thus, the discharge capacity of the counter electrode {{was designed to be}} much higher than that of the hydride electrode. Electrochemical tests were carried out on DC- 5 automatic battery testing instrument. Each electrode was charged at 100  mA g− 1 for 5  h followed by a 15  min break, and then discharged at 60  mA g− 1 to a cut-off cell voltage of −[*] 0.5  V versus the Hg/HgO reference electrode.|$|E
50|$|Water-based fungicides, {{because they}} are water-based, can be washed-away in time if the wood they are applied to <b>keeps</b> getting <b>wet.</b> This is another reason why it is {{important}} to fix leaks and keep the wood dry and with an alkaline environment, and seal the wood and especially the end grain to prevent ongoing exposure to hungry spores.|$|R

50|$|In the absorbed {{glass mat}} design, or AGM for short, the spaces between the cells is {{replaced}} by a glass fibre mat soaked in electrolyte. There is only enough electrolyte in the mat to <b>keep</b> it <b>wet,</b> and if the battery is punctured the electrolyte will not flow out of the mats. Likewise, the mat greatly reduces evaporation, {{to the point that the}} batteries do not require periodic refilling of the water. This combination of features allows the battery to be completely sealed, which makes them useful in portable devices and similar roles.|$|R
60|$|Making no reply, the man shook Olfan and {{the other}} two captains by the hand, saluted Juanna, and {{vanished}} into the darkness. Then they all sat {{down in front of the}} mouth of the tunnel to wait and watch, and very glad were they of the goat-skin cloaks which had belonged to the priests, for as the night drew towards the dawn, the cold became so bitter that they could scarcely bear it, but were obliged to rise and stamp to and fro to <b>keep</b> their <b>wet</b> feet from freezing.|$|R

60|$|Note 1. Many {{people at}} home have asked me how such thin things can <b>keep</b> out the <b>wet</b> of the snow.

When it becomes wet in spring, Europeans adopt ordinary English shoes, and Indians do not mind the wet.|$|R
50|$|Ran Tai - The first {{city the}} marines reach {{on the far}} side of the Tarstan Mountains. Located in a valley high above sea level, the valley is a rather idillic spot for humans as the {{temperature}} is around 25 degrees with little humidity (a break from the constant steam bath of the jungle). However, Mardukans find it almost unbarably cold and dry, forcing the natives to wear clothes that they <b>keep</b> constantly <b>wet</b> and swimming in the local lake (blessedly bereft of predators). The city itself is needed to support the Mardukans who grow spices and plants that need to cold and dry air to grow and for the gold, silver, iron and gems mined from the mountains.|$|R
50|$|The pad itself acts as {{a rather}} {{effective}} air filter when properly maintained; {{it is capable of}} removing a variety of contaminants in air, including urban ozone caused by pollution , regardless of very dry weather. Refrigeration-based cooling systems lose this ability whenever there is not enough humidity in the air to <b>keep</b> the evaporator <b>wet</b> while providing a frequent trickle of condensation that washes out dissolved impurities removed from the air.|$|R
30|$|The {{contact angle}} {{which is the}} angle on the contact {{interface}} between the liquid and solid is a popular index for expressing surface wettability of general materials such as metals, glasses, and resins [22]. However, measurement of the contact angle on high wettability surfaces such as hydrogels and cellular tissues is seldom done, because the liquid drop is immediately fused with the material surface. Furthermore, {{in the case of}} cellular tissues, the wet condition of tissues must be maintained, because drying on the surface causes cell damage. To <b>keep</b> the <b>wet</b> condition, a captive-bubble based contact-angle measurement was developed [14], however, this measurement is difficult to apply to cell culture dish systems in vitro because the entire culture dish must be immersed into a liquid pool.|$|R

60|$|RECIPE FOR GERMAN COFFEE Take {{a barrel}} of water {{and bring it to}} a boil; rub a chicory berry against a coffee berry, then convey the former into the water. Continue the boiling and {{evaporation}} until the intensity of the flavor and aroma of the coffee and chicory has been diminished to a proper degree; then set aside to cool. Now unharness the remains of a once cow from the plow, insert them in a hydraulic press, and when you shall have acquired a teaspoon of that pale-blue juice which a German superstition regards as milk, modify the malignity of its strength in a bucket of tepid water and ring up the breakfast. Mix the beverage in a cold cup, partake with moderation, and <b>keep</b> a <b>wet</b> rag around your head to guard against over-excitement.|$|R
60|$|They {{travelled}} in the night, halting {{an hour or}} {{two after}} daybreak, and lying by until the twilight fell. The escort were so wretchedly clothed, that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged shoulders to <b>keep</b> the <b>wet</b> off. Apart from the personal discomfort of being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying his musket very recklessly, Charles Darnay did not allow the restraint that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for, he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations, confirmable by the prisoner in the Abbaye, that were not yet made.|$|R

50|$|In all his incarnations, Namor {{possesses}} superhuman strength and, {{with the}} possible exceptions of Orka and Tyrak at their full sizes, is the strongest Atlantean ever known. The exact level of his strength is dependent upon his physical contact with water, in which he needn't be submerged. It has been shown as sufficient to effortlessly toss a water-filled ocean-liner, despite the underwater viscosity. His strength diminishes slowly the longer {{he is out of}} contact with water, though an extended period on land does not result in his death, as it would for a typical Atlantean, and his power is retained in full as long as he <b>keeps</b> himself <b>wet.</b> Namor possesses superhuman stamina and resistance to injury due to his hybrid nature. Namor's strength level is such that he has held his own in hand-to-hand combat with beings as powerful as the Hulk in the past.|$|R
