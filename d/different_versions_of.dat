5|$|A {{theory of}} strings that {{incorporates}} {{the idea of}} supersymmetry is called a superstring theory. There are several <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> superstring theory which are all subsumed within the M-theory framework. At low energies, the superstring theories are approximated by supergravity in ten spacetime dimensions. Similarly, M-theory is approximated at low energies by supergravity in eleven dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Emerson and Lake {{recruited}} Carl Palmer from Atomic Rooster {{and formed}} Emerson, Lake & Palmer (ELP). In 1971, the posthumous Nice album Elegy was released. It included <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> previously released tracks, two being studio versions and two {{live from the}} 1969 US tour. Emerson had no involvement with compiling the album, which was done by Jackson, Davison and Charisma Records. The album reached No.5 in the UK.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{selection}} acts on an organism's phenotype, {{or physical}} characteristics. Phenotype {{is determined by}} an organism's genetic make-up (genotype) and {{the environment in which}} the organism lives. When different organisms in a population possess <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> a gene for a certain trait, each of these versions is known as an allele. It is this genetic variation that underlies differences in phenotype. An example is the ABO blood type antigens in humans, where three alleles govern the phenotype.|$|E

5|$|Some conversations, due {{to their}} private nature, were fictionalized; Ottaviani makes up Marsh's lobby to Congress and what {{happened}} during his meeting with President Grant, and P.T. Barnum never told off Marsh {{the way he did}} in the novel. Ottaviani also wove the story Marsh tells about the Mastodon from several <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> the legend.|$|E
5|$|The Independent and Ledger offered <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> events, {{the former}} more {{sympathetic}} to the Nelsons. According to the Independent, Laura grabbed another gun, a Winchester rifle hidden behind a trunk. L. D. grabbed the Winchester at the same time, and during the struggle for the gun, it went off. A shell passed through Constable Martin's pant legs, grazing him in the thigh, then hit Loney in the hip and entered his abdomen. He walked outside and died a few minutes later.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or penis during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of the penis, and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (<b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> the same structure).|$|E

5|$|After Calabi–Yau {{manifolds}} {{had entered}} physics {{as a way}} to compactify extra dimensions, many physicists began studying these manifolds. In the late 1980s, Lance Dixon, Wolfgang Lerche, Cumrun Vafa, and Nick Warner noticed that given such a compactification of string theory, {{it is not possible to}} reconstruct uniquely a corresponding Calabi–Yau manifold. Instead, two <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> string theory called type IIA string theory and type IIB can be compactified on completely different Calabi–Yau manifolds giving rise to the same physics. In this situation, the manifolds are called mirror manifolds, and the relationship between the two physical theories is called mirror symmetry.|$|E
5|$|After {{the final}} photo was selected, Heiden {{commissioned}} two <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> the album cover. The original image {{was taken in}} black-and-white, and Heiden experimented {{with a variety of}} treatments of the photo, {{to go along with the}} album's title, and finally arrived at the blue toned, hand tinted version of the image. The LP and CD album cover is a cropped image of a longer picture including torso, more of which is seen in the cover of the cassette tape edition, and was also included as a fold-out poster in the initial pressings of the LP. A poster of Madonna, mirroring the cover art, was included within the vinyl versions of the album.|$|E
5|$|Between 1200 and 1600 several laws {{emerged that}} {{drastically}} altered the game. Checkmate became a requirement to win; a player could not win by capturing {{all of the}} opponent's pieces. Stalemate was added, although the outcome has changed several times (see History of the stalemate rule). Pawns gained the option of moving two squares on their first move, and the en passant rule was a natural consequence of that new option. The king and rook acquired the right to castle (see Variations throughout history of castling for <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> the rule).|$|E

5|$|Due to its graphic content, {{there are}} several <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> Cannibal Holocaust in {{circulation}} which are edited to varying degrees. In the UK, the film was originally released on VHS by Go Video in 1982 with approximately six minutes of cuts. These cuts were self-imposed by the distributor, possibly due to technical limitations of the tape. In 2001, the film was passed for release on DVD by the BBFC with 5 minutes and 44 seconds of cuts to remove scenes of animal cruelty and sexual violence; all but 15 seconds of these cuts were waived for a re-release in 2011. The latter release also includes a new edit sponsored by Deodato which reduces the violence toward animals.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle has closely {{associated}} with the legend of Sir Guy the Seeker since at least the early 19th century. <b>Different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> the story vary slightly in their details, but typically involve a knight, Sir Guy, arriving at Dunstanburgh Castle, where he was met by a wizard and led inside. There he comes across a noble lady imprisoned inside a crystal tomb and guarded by a sleeping army. The wizard offers Guy a choice of either a sword or a hunting horn to help free the lady; he incorrectly chooses the horn, which wakes the sleeping knights. Sir Guy finds himself outside Dunstanburgh Castle, and spends {{the rest of his life}} attempting to find a way back inside.|$|E
5|$|Guitar Hero On Tour: Decades was {{announced}} on July 15, 2008, at the 2008 E3 conference, and released on November 16, 2008. Executive Producer David Nathanielsz {{stated that the}} short time between releases was to help give DS players the same depth of content as available to the console players of Guitar Hero. Additionally, Vicarious Visions incorporated the ability to share songs between <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> the game through the wi-fi capabilities of the DS in order to expand the number of potential songs to more than 50.|$|E

5|$|In Japan, eight DVD compilations, {{in regular}} and special editions, were {{released}} containing three episodes each, between June 23, 2006, and January 25, 2007. The regular and special editions {{are similar in}} content, but the special editions are packaged in jacket sleeve, and contain an original booklet which includes additional merchandise such as portable plates and straps. The special edition includes <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> the opening and closing themes, and deleted scenes. Media Blasters released five English-subtitled DVDs of Strawberry Panic between March 4, 2007 and November 11, 2008. The English-subtitled DVDs contain five episodes, except for its first release, which contains six. The series premiered on Toku in the United States on December 31, 2015.|$|E
5|$|Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, {{waiting for}} Comic-Con tickets {{to go on}} sale online. After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} be able to attend, especially as they had spent so much time on their costumes, intending to go as <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>different</b> <b>versions</b> <b>of</b> {{the events}} were set down and {{distributed}} {{due to the}} excitement around the trial and the public demand for entertainments based on the murder, making it hard for modern readers to discern fact from melodramatic embellishment. Good official records exist from the trial, and the best record of the events surrounding the case is {{generally considered to be}} that of James Curtis, a journalist who spent time with Corder and two weeks in Polstead interviewing those concerned. He was apparently so connected with the case that a newspaper artist who was asked to produce a picture of the accused man drew a likeness of Curtis instead of Corder.|$|E
