25|$|While Middlebury College {{certainly}} {{began the}} sporting craze for quidditch, an independent {{form of the}} sport originated {{in the early spring}} of 2007 {{on the campus of the}} University of North Georgia in Dahlonega, Georgia. This version of the sport uses a <b>Flying</b> <b>Disk</b> as its quaffle, dodge balls as bludgers, and a golden-yellow 'super ball' for the snitch. This form of the game (known affectionately as 'Corrigan Quidditch' after its originator, an English professor at the university who taught a Harry Potter class that term and developed the game for tournament play as an outgrowth of that course) does not call for players to hold a broom between the legs. Additionally, all of the playing apparatus is located within the playing pitch (quaffle, bludgers, snitch, beater's bats, and keeper's brooms). The two brooms are used only to defend the goals, which rise five, ten, and fifteen feet above the pitch at each end of an elongated octagonal playing field approximately 200 feet long. 'Corrigan Quidditch', as does the Middlebury version, has its own official rule book but features whimsical offenses including a 'Queensbury' (moving both feet whilst holding the quaffle) and an 'Impermissible' (which allows the offended chaser to run with the quaffle (without incurring a Queensbury offense) and make a 'try' at the goals, defended only by the opposing keeper). Play includes non-participating teams who stand around the pitch and take control of both 'bludgering' players as well as 'sending off' the snitch at irregular intervals during play to allow the seekers (who are kept secret during play) to attempt a game-winning catch. 'Corrigan Quidditch' was the form of play originally covered in the world press during that significant summer when the seventh Harry Potter book (and fifth Harry Potter movie) was released. Unlike the world-popular Middlebury version, 'Corrigan Quidditch' remains a local event still played on its originating campus.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the integration of}} thin film ZnO strain sensors onto hard disk drive suspensions for improved vibra-tion suppression for tracking control. Sensor location was de-signed using an efficient optimization methodology based on lin-ear quadratic gaussian (LQG) control. Sensors were fabricated directly onto steel wafers that were subsequently made into in-strumented suspensions. Prototype instrumented suspensions were installed into commercial hard drives and tested. For the first time, a sensing signal was successfully obtained while the suspension was <b>flying</b> on a <b>disk</b> as in normal drive operation.

40|$|AbstractBurnish head {{is widely}} used for {{burnishing}} process {{which is one of}} the critical ways to remove such asperities from the disk surface prior to assembly into hard disk drive. To achieve glide performance for ultra-low <b>flying</b> height, <b>disk</b> media with asperities that exceed the flying height of the magnetic head must be eliminated. One of critical parameter of burnish head is the rail dimension which required very deep etching at > 30 microns. To produce such etching depth, a Cr hard mask is needed. Wet etching process for Cr film was selected to form the Cr hard mask. In this study, the interactions of wet etching condition with the Cr hard mask were investigated in terms of the process impact to the mask wall angle. The chemical reaction was studied and discussed here in term of mass transportation condition. XPS revealed that the etch byproduct was Cr nitrate (Cr(NO 3) 3) and Cr oxide (Cr 2 O 3). These byproducts passivated the metal surface and limited the fresh etchant arrival onto unetched surface. From the etched topography study, the process is said to be under mass transport control, and the reaction rate was determined to be influenced by the rate of mass transfer of reactants and products to and from the surface...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{the next}} {{generation}} near-field optical data storage systems, higher data transfer rate and higher data density require the optical pickup head to maintain a constant sub-micrometer flying height above the rotating disk surface without any collisions. However, suspension vibration and force disturbance, as well as disk vibration {{make it difficult to}} maintain the desired <b>flying</b> height during <b>disk</b> operation in the near-field optical disk drives (ODD). It is proposed in this paper to design a hybrid actuator system which combines both advantages of the flying slide used in hard disk drives and the voice coil actuator used in optical disk drives. Then based on the developed model of the hybrid actuator, an adaptive regulation approach is proposed to regulate the flying height at its desired value, despite the unknown vibrations and the unknown force disturbance. The performance of the proposed approach is analyzed and simulation results are presented to illustrate the capability of the proposed adaptive regulation approach to achieve and maintain the desired flying height.

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the external cavity laser diode are investigated. Emphasis {{is placed on the}} short external cavity configuration. The general governing model equations which include the multiple reflection effect are derived. It is shown that the coupling coefficient becomes a complex function of the external cavity length and the near field beam size of the laser diode due to the diffraction loss of an open resonator. The validity of this open resonator model is proven experimentally by the asymmetry in optical power versus external cavity length characteristic curve. For analysis of the ultra short external cavity laser, it is necessary to include this complex coupling coefficient. As an example, the <b>flying</b> optical <b>disk</b> head is studied using this model. In some cases, especially when the external cavity length is longer than several micrometers, the external cavity may be simply regarded as a lossy resonator. With this constant loss per roundtrip approximation, the feedback operator can be reduced to the closed form. The stationary and transient solutions are investigated analytically and numerically. The single mode condition, and dynamical stability condition are derived. Also, the simple expression for the relaxation oscillation frequency of the short external cavity laser is given for the first time. With our model, it {{can not be expected to}} find the strange attractor for the constant biased autonomous operation. However, the chaotic behavior in the current modulated nonautonomous operation is investigated. It seems that the route to chaos in this system is not limited to the period-doubling route, which has been believed as the only route in the modulated solitary laser diode so far. Generally, it is suggested that the operating external cavity length should be close to the constructive interference position, as it will give superior properties. Some experimental results applying the short external cavity laser as a laser diode sensor are given...|$|R

50|$|When {{playing as}} the Predator, the player's {{objective}} is to reach and kill the Alien queen in order to claim her skull. The Predator can use elevators to travel between levels but he cannot travel through the air ducts. He can carry medical kits and use them later to recover health, and can use a cloaking device to become invisible from the Aliens and the Marines. Weapons and scoring are based on how the Predator kills enemies. Killing an enemy while invisible results {{in a loss of}} honor points, which can in turn result in losing equipped weapons. Killing an enemy while visible result in an increase in honor points, which in turn allows access to more weapons.

40|$|Publisher横浜The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{improvement}} in skill with and without immediate image feedback during the learning of a sidearm throw in <b>flying</b> <b>disk</b> sports. We utilized the Dart Trainer Pro application program (Dart Fish Co. LTD) in a personal computer; this program has a feature of delayed image playback.

The aim of all the students in the class was to acquire the skill of throwing using a straight disk by a sidearm throw. According to the results, the success rate of throwing a straight disk and self-evaluation for the acquisition of skill in the image feedback group were higher than those observed in the group that did not receive feedback. It was confirmed that immediate image feedback was very effective in improving the throwing skill. In addition, by using the analytical function of Dart Trainer Pro, we demonstrated an instance of improvement / non-improvement in the throwing skill depending on the motion.
