This {{study was conducted to}} design a mechanism of oil palm fresh fruit bunches catchment and its potential energy utilization. The potential energy of falling fruit bunches during oil palm harvesting that stored in the flat <b>spiral</b> <b>spring,</b> and used to drive the wheelbarrow. The actual energy potential and torque performance of flat <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> was measured by using a torque and potential energy measuring apparatus. The results showed that the potential energy from falling fruit bunches could store in the flat <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> mechanism, with storage efficiency of 39. 39 %. By means of 1. 5 rotation of flat <b>spiral</b> <b>spring,</b> the maximum torque of the flat <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> was 53. 35 Nm. The utilization of potential energy that stored in the flat <b>spiral</b> <b>spring</b> has been successfully used to drive the wheelbarrow, with utilization efficiency of 80. 39 %. By using the potential energy of 38. 64 J, wheelbarrow could move as far as 0. 41 m to evacuate 48 kg of total weight loads...|$|R

The geometric parameters of spring are determined. The maximum deformation and the stress distribution of spring are obtained. Moreover, the modal analysis of spring is carried out and the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of first 20 orders are obtained. The relationship between the natural frequency and deformation is also analyzed.
