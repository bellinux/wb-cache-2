5|$|The harbour town of Svendborg in {{the south}} east of Funen {{dates back to the}} 13th century. Real {{prosperity}} emerged in the 19th century when shipbuilding and trade became important drivers. The town subsequently underwent a period of renovation with new brick and stone buildings lining <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> streets. The old town has now become an important tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|The scenery is {{now less}} wild, the cliffs less high. Rumps Point has Iron Age defences across <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> neck but the path heads {{straight}} past to Pentire Head then swings eastwards again into Polzeath. The estuary of the River Camel forces a detour {{away from the}} sea to Rock and the Black Tor Ferry that takes walkers into Padstow.|$|E
5|$|A {{little further}} on, I found the older and smaller wall, {{which used to}} enclose the pent-up inner prison where nobody was put, except for ceremony. But, whosoever goes into Marshalsea Place, turning out of Angel Court, leading to Bermondsey, will find {{his feet on the}} very paving-stones of the extinct Marshalsea jail; will see <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> yard to the right and to the left, very little altered if at all, except that the walls were lowered when the place got free; will look upon the rooms in which the debtors lived; and will stand among the {{crowding}} ghosts of many miserable years.|$|E

5|$|In {{a threat}} display, the mamba usually opens its inky black mouth, spreads <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> neck-flap and {{sometimes}} hisses. It {{is capable of}} striking at considerable range and occasionally may deliver a series of bites in rapid succession. Its venom is primarily composed of potent neurotoxins that may cause fast onset of symptoms. Despite its reputation for being formidable and highly aggressive, like most snakes, it usually attempts to flee from humans unless threatened or cornered. The black mamba is rated as least concern on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN)'s Red List of Endangered species.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, Llantwit {{developed}} into a dormitory town and grew about 15 times in size to accommodate the Royal Air Force at St Athan. Despite its modernization and rapid growth, it retains its pre-modern feel with <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> winding streets, high walls, old town hall and gatehouse, and several inns and houses dated to the 16th century. Llantwit Major railway station on the Vale of Glamorgan Line was reopened in June 2005. In 2014, it was rated {{one of the most}} attractive postcode areas to live in Wales.|$|E
5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. <b>Its</b> <b>narrow</b> road had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp bend in the Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E

5|$|The cookiecutter shark {{exhibits}} {{a number of}} specializations to its mouth and pharynx for its parasitic lifestyle. The shark first secures itself to the body surface of its prey by closing its spiracles and retracting its basihyal (tongue) to create pressure {{lower than that of}} the surroundings; its suctorial lips ensure a tight seal. It then bites, using <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> upper teeth as anchors while its razor sharp lower teeth slice into the prey. Finally, the shark twists and rotates its body to complete a circular cut, quite possibly aided by the initial forward momentum and subsequent struggles of its prey. The action of the lower teeth may also be assisted by back-and-forth vibrations of the jaw, a mechanism akin to that of an electric carving knife. This shark's ability to create strong suction into its mouth is likely also of utility in capturing smaller prey such as squid.|$|E
5|$|As {{late as the}} mid-1970s, Doi Mae Salong was {{strictly}} off-limits to outsiders. Since 1994, Santikhiri has capitalised on its unique history and has developed into a tourist attraction, with <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> winding streets lined with inns, noodle shops and teashops. As a result, Santikhiri {{has become one of}} Thailand's top ten destinations among backpackers today. The former soldiers had settled down, some of them having married ethnic Chinese brides who crossed the border after the fighting stopped, and others having married local Thais. The old soldiers carry on their normal lives peacefully now, but still retain their Chinese identity; the main language spoken remains Yunnanese. Among their local-born descendants, some have adopted a Thai identity and no longer identify with their Chinese ancestry. As of 2007, General Lue Ye-tien, aged 90 and Tuan's former right-hand man, {{is the leader of the}} group, after taking over the leadership on Tuan's death in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being more}} powerfully built than other large cats, Smilodon had a weaker bite. Modern big cats have more {{pronounced}} zygomatic arches, while these were smaller in Smilodon, which restricted the thickness and therefore {{power of the}} temporalis muscles and thus reduced Smilodons bite force. Analysis of <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> jaws indicates that it could produce a bite only a third as strong {{as that of a}} lion. There seems to be a general rule that the saber-toothed cats with the largest canines had proportionally weaker bites. Analyses of canine bending strength (the ability of the canine teeth to resist bending forces without breaking) and bite forces indicate that the saber-toothed cats' teeth were stronger relative to the bite force than those of modern big cats. In addition, Smilodons gape could have reached almost 120 degrees, while that of the modern lion reaches 65 degrees. This made the gape wide enough to allow Smilodon to grasp large prey despite the long canines.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the great}} {{prosperity}} the dock afforded the city, within 20 {{years of its}} construction the Albert Dock was beginning to struggle. Designed and constructed to handle sailing ships of up to 1,000tonnes, {{by the start of}} the 20th century only 7% of ships into the Port of Liverpool were sailing vessels. The development of steam ships in the later 19th century meant that soon the dock simply wasn't large enough, as <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> entrances prevented larger vessels from entering it. Its lack of quayside was also becoming an issue. Generally steamships could be loaded and unloaded far quicker than sailing ships, and in a cruel twist of irony, the dockside warehouses that had once made the Albert Dock so attractive, were now hindering its future development. Nonetheless the Albert Dock remained {{an integral part of the}} dock system in Liverpool and in 1878 the pump house was built as part of redevelopment that saw the majority of the cranes converted to hydraulic use, whilst in 1899, part of the north stack was converted to allow for ice production and cold storage.|$|E
5|$|In 1928 China adopted GR as the nation's {{official}} romanization system. GR {{was used}} to indicate pronunciations in dictionaries of the National (Mandarin-based) Language. Its proponents hoped one day to establish it as a writing system for a reformed Chinese script. But despite support from {{a small number of}} trained linguists in China and overseas, GR met with public indifference and even hostility due to its complexity. Another obstacle preventing its widespread adoption was <b>its</b> <b>narrow</b> basis on the Beijing dialect, in a period lacking a strong centralized government to enforce its use. Eventually GR lost ground to Pinyin and other later romanization systems. However, its influence is still evident, as several of the principles introduced by its creators have been used in romanization systems that followed it. Its pattern of tone spelling was retained in the standard spelling of the Chinese province of Shaanxi (shǎnxī, 陝西), which cannot be distinguished from Shanxi (shānxī, 山西) when written in pinyin without diacritics.|$|E
