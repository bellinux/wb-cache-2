40|$|One of {{the major}} factors {{hindering}} the use of qualitative simulation techniques to reason about the behavior of complex dynamical systems is intractable branching due to a phenomenon called chatter. This paper presents two general abstraction techniques that {{solve the problem of}} <b>chatter.</b> <b>Eliminating</b> the problem of chatter significantly extends the range of models that can be tractably simulated using qualitative simulation. Chatter occurs when a variable's direction of change is constrained only by continuity within a region of the state space. This results in intractable, potentially infinite branching within the behavioral description due to irrelevant distinctions in the direction of change. While a number of techniques have been proposed to <b>eliminate</b> <b>chatter,</b> none of them provide a general solution that can eliminate all instances of chatter.

40|$|In this {{treatment}} a control algorithm is developed to zero {{the states of}} a class of nominally linear systems while considering accumulation of a state dependent cost. Due to physical limits on actuators {{and the presence of}} unknown disturbances that cannot be accounted for explicitly in the system mathematical model, the control problem addressed is actually nonlinear. Lyapunov optimizing control (LOC) techniques are used to specify a control law; LOC combines Lyapunov stability theory with function minimization to provide controls that consider stability of the origin and minimization of cost. LOC techniques, combined with trajectory following optimization (TFO) methods, provide a means to <b>eliminate</b> the <b>chatter</b> phenomenon which is notorious for the considered problem class. A control law that produces discontinuous chatter is undesirable; instantaneous switching of mechanical actuators can excite resonant modes, induce vibration, and produce a number of other detrimental effects. It has been shown that to provide a satisfactory system response using these methods a large gain must be introduced in an appropriately defined augmented system of governing differential equations. This creates a “stiff ” set of differential equations which are difficult to treat analytically and numerically. To deal with this issue, an alternate TFO control implementation is proposed which greatly reduces the effect of the stiff differential equations. Ultimately, a control law that stabilizes the target, considers cost, and <b>eliminates</b> <b>chatter</b> in the presence of unknown disturbance is realized. In addition, the theory of LOC is extended by proving the stability results for instances when traditional LOC algorithms cannot...|$|R
