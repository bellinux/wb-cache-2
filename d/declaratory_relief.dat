5|$|On {{behalf of}} Bryan, Legal Services {{attorney}} Patrick Moriarty then sued {{the state and}} Itasca County in the District Court of Itasca County, seeking <b>declaratory</b> <b>relief</b> and an injunction which would prevent the state and county from collecting taxes from Indians on tribal land. This was filed as a class action suit. There was no dispute as to {{the facts of the}} case, so the matter was submitted as a question of law to Judge James F. Murphy. In 1973, the district court held that the state and county were authorized to collect such taxes under Public Law 280. Murphy noted that while the Chippewa had at one time been a sovereign Indian nation, their members were now citizens of Minnesota and received benefits from the state such as county services, the court system, and other like services.|$|E
