60|$|They had marched {{more than}} thirty {{kilometres}} since dawn, along the white, hot road where occasional thickets of trees threw a moment of shade, then out into the glare again. On either hand, the valley, wide and shallow, glittered with heat; dark green patches of rye, pale young corn, fallow and meadow and black pine woods spread in a dull, hot diagram under a glistening sky. But right in front the mountains ranged across, pale blue and very still, snow gleaming gently out of the deep atmosphere. And towards the mountains, on and on, the regiment marched between the rye fields and the meadows, between the scraggy fruit trees set regularly on either side the high road. The burnished, dark <b>green</b> <b>rye</b> threw on a suffocating heat, the mountains drew gradually nearer and more distinct. While {{the feet of the}} soldiers grew hotter, sweat ran through their hair under their helmets, and their knapsacks could burn no more in contact with their shoulders, but seemed instead to give off a cold, prickly sensation.|$|E

For the next week the French pressed hard upon the rear of the retreating Russians, but failed to bring on a battle, while they themselves suffered from an incessant downpour of rain which made the roads well-nigh impassable. The commissariat train broke down, and a hundred pieces of cannon and 5000 ammunition waggons had to be abandoned. The rain, and a bitterly cold wind that accompanied it, brought on an epidemic among the horses, which were forced to depend solely upon the <b>green</b> <b>rye</b> growing in the fields. Several thousands died; the troops themselves suffered so much from thirst and hunger that no less than 30,000 stragglers fell out from the ranks and spread themselves over the country, burning, ravaging, plundering, and committing terrible depredations. Such dismay was caused by their treatment that the villages were all abandoned, and the whole population retired before the advance of the French, driving their flocks and herds before them, and thus adding greatly to the difficulties of the invaders.|$|E

40|$|The phylogenetic {{structure}} of the microbial community residing in a fermentation sample from a production-scale biogas plant fed with maize silage, <b>green</b> <b>rye</b> and liquid manure was analysed by an integrated approach using clone library sequences and metagenome sequence data obtained by 454 -pyrosequencing. Sequencing of 109 clones from a bacterial and an archaeal 16 S-rDNA amplicon library revealed that the obtained nucleotide sequences are similar but not identical to 16 S-rDNA database sequences derived from different anaerobic environments including digestors and bioreactors. Most of the bacterial 16 S-rDNA sequences could be assigned to the phylum Firmicutes with the most abundant class Clostridia and to the class Bacteroidetes, whereas most archaeal 16 S-rDNA sequences cluster close to the methanogen Methanoculleus bourgensis. Further sequences of the archaeal library most probably represent so far non-characterised species within the genus Methanoculleus. A similar result derived from phylogenetic analysis of mcrA clone sequences. The mcrA gene product encodes the α-subunit of methyl-coenzyme-M reductase involved in the final step of methanogenesis. BLASTn analysis applying stringent settings resulted in assignment of 16 S-rDNA metagenome sequence reads to 62 16 S-rDNA amplicon sequences thus enabling frequency of abundance estimations for 16 S-rDNA clone library sequences. Ribosomal Database Project (RDP) Classifier processing of metagenome 16 S-rDNA reads revealed abundance of the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes and Euryarchaeota and the orders Clostridiales, Bacteroidales and Methanomicrobiales. Moreover, a large fraction of 16 S-rDNA metagenome reads could not be assigned to lower taxonomic ranks, demonstrating that numerous microorganisms in the analysed fermentation sample of the biogas plant are still unclassified or unknown...|$|E

Results showed that, although treatment effects on dryland wheat grain yield was not significant, but maximum grain yield (2484 kg ha - 1) was obtained from application of <b>rye</b> <b>green</b> manure along with 26 kg N ha - 1; which is 22 % more than check (without <b>rye</b> <b>green</b> manure) treatment. Green manure application with or without nitrogen increased EC (dS m - 1), but decreased OC, P (av.), Cu (av.), Mn (av.), Zn (av.) and sand in the soil. In contrast to green manure, application of nitrogen along with green manure increased saturation and clay. In the stage of stem appearance, soil moisture content decreased 8 % in green-manure application but with nitrogen application the moisture increased 6 % compared with check in 0 - 20 cm depth. It can be concluded that, green manure application is useful along with nitrogen fertilizer application in long term. This treatment could increase soil moisture content, which leads to higher wheat grain yield in dryland areas. In addition, green manure application could change some soil characteristics such as soil TNV%, which decreases availability of some essential nutrients for dryland wheat...|$|R

50|$|Danish {{cooking is}} rooted in the peasant dishes served across the country before the Industrial Revolution in 1860. It was based on the need to make use of natural {{products}} available on or near the family farm. As a result, a variety of brassicas, bread, fish, pork and later potatoes, were eaten everywhere. Families had their own storage of long-lasting dry products, rye for making bread, barley for beer, dried peas for soup and smoked or salted pork. While industrialization brought increases in the consumption of fresh meat and <b>green</b> vegetables, <b>rye</b> bread and potatoes continued to be staples. With the arrival of dairy cooperatives {{in the second half of}} the 19th century, milk also gained favor. Wood-fired ovens and meat grinders contributed to a range of new dishes including frikadeller (meat balls), roast pork, poached cod and steaks of ground beef.

40|$|Understanding the {{transfer}} of mercury (Hg) from soil to crops is crucial due to Hg toxicity and Hg occurrence in terrestrial systems. Previous {{research has shown that}} available Hg in soils contributes to plant Hg levels. Plant Hg concentrations are related to soil conditions and plant characteristics. Mechanistic models describing such soil–plant interactions are however difficult to quantify. Here we performed a field study in agricultural, mining and industrial areas in Portugal to evaluate potential food chain risks. The uptake of Hg by Italian ryegrass, ryegrass, orchard grass, collard <b>greens</b> and <b>rye</b> was measured to calculate daily intakes (DI) of Hg for cows and sheep grazing. A total of 136 soil samples and 129 plant samples were analysed. Results show that total Hg concentrations ranged from 0. 01 to 98 mg kg- 1 in soils; 0. 01 – 5. 4 mg kg- 1 in shoots and 0. 01 – 42 mg kg- 1 in roots. Calculated DI ranged from 0. 18 to 132 mg d- 1 for cows, and from 0. 028 to 23 mg d- 1 for sheep. In 27 grassland sites, daily intakes exceeded the acceptable daily intake of both cows and sheep in view of food safety considering Hg in animal kidneys evidencing potential risks to human health. The transfer of Hg from soil to crops was described using empirical Freundlich-type functions. For ryegrass, orchard grass and collard greens, the soil-to-root or soil-to-shoot transfer of Hg appeared to be controlled by the total soil Hg concentration and levels of Alox and Feox. Empirical functions allowed us to obtain realistic estimates of Hg levels in crops and can be used as an alternative to mechanistic models when evaluating food chain risks of Hg contamination in agricultural soils...|$|R

The a-amylase gene fragment from Anoxybacillus sp. denoted as ASKA was cloned into pET- 22 b(+) and transformed into Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3). However, the reactivity and productivity of this amylase is underexplored. The main {{objective of this}} project is to optimize the reducing sugars production using Response Surface Methodology (RSM). The ASKA substrate specificity was determined using soluble starch and nine different commercial starches: corn, tapioca, wheat, potato, rice, sago, <b>rye,</b> <b>green</b> peas and glutinous rice starch. Sago starch {{was found to be}} the best substrate with highest reducing sugars production. Variable parameters such as reaction temperature, sago starch and ASKA concentration were screened using one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) approach before they were optimized through two-level full factorial design and central composite rotatable design (CCRD). Statistical analysis showed that all the three parameters were significant factors in 23 full factorial design before further optimized the reducing sugars production with CCRD. The final optimized parameters using CCRD was capable to produce 7. 97 g/L reducing sugars with 2. 64 % (w/v) sago starch and 0. 375 unit ASKA under 66. 9 ºC reaction temperature. The hydrolysis products were determined using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Maltose was the major hydrolysis product and no glucose production was detected.

The aim of the investigation was to establish the weediness’ dynamics of crops in a six-field crop rotation of an organic farming system. The field was certified as being organic. Crop rotation: 1. triticale/ <b>rye</b> (for <b>green</b> manure in spring), 2. oil radish (for <b>green</b> manure) / <b>rye</b> (for <b>green</b> manure in autumn), 3. potatoes, 4. oats, 5. vetch-oats mix (for green forage) with an undersown mixture of red clover and timothy, 6. red clover and timothy. Conventional soil tillage was done according to the requirements of the crops. The weeds were counted two times during the vegetation period of crops: at the early development stages of crops (for instance, at the tillering of cereals) and before the crop harvesting. The composition of weed flora comprised from 59 species in the crops’ stands. The annual dicotyledonus were dominating groups of the weed flora. The most abundant weeds were lambsquarters (Chenopodium album L.), quackgrass (Elytrigia repens (L.) Nevski), common yellow rocket (Barbarea vulgaris R. Br. p. p.). The significantly smaller amount of weeds among crop rotation links was observed in the link rye/ oil radish/ rye – potatoes – oats. Much worse suppression of weeds was obtained in the crop rotation link red clover and timothy – triticale/ rye – oil radish/ rye. The number of weeds in the fields of crop rotation in the organic farming system is dependent on the cultivated crops, the succession of crops in the crop rotation links and crop cultivation technologies...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} study, was to {{evaluate}} the effect of winter cover crop residues on speed of seed  potato emergence and percentage of organic carbon, soil specific weight and soil temperature. An experiment was carried out at the Research Farm of Agriculture Faculty, Bu-AliSinaUniversity, in 2008 - 2009. The experiment was a randomized complete block design with three replications. Winter cover crops consisted of rye, barley and oilseed rape, each one with common plant density (rye and barley at 190 kg. ha- 1 and oilseed rape at 9 kg. ha- 1) and triple plant densities(rye and barley 570 kg. ha- 1 and oilseed rape, 27 kg. ha- 1) and control (without cover crop). The results showed that rye and barley with triple plant densities produced higher biomass (1503. 5 and 1392. 2 g/m 2, respectively) than other treatments. Soil physicochemical properties were affected significantly by using cover crops. Rye, barley, and oilseed rape with triple rate and rye with common rape of plant densities produced, the highest organic carbon. <b>Green</b> manure of <b>rye</b> and barley with triple and rye with common rate plant densities, reduced soil specific weights by 17. 3, 18 and 18 percent {{as compared with the}} control treatment (without cover crop planting). Rye and barley with triple plant densities increased average soil temperature by 12 and 11 percent respectively in comparison with control treatment. These treatments increased speed of seed potato emergence by 20 and 12 percent respectively as compared with that of control treatment, respectively. Other treatments showed no significant difference as compared to control. Cover crop residues increased plants speed of seed potato emergence through improving soil conditions...|$|R
40|$|Finland’s {{policy of}} subsidising the {{conversion}} to organic production precipitated {{the rapid growth}} of organic farming in the 1990 ’s. As a consequence, many stockless farms encountered the problems of nitrogen deficit, poor grain quality, and weed control. Since the spreading of green mulch on cash crops is very common especially in tropical agriculture, organic fertilisers like green mulch may be an alternative that would compensate for the prohibition on the use of mineral N-fertilisers. However, one problem is that presently there is no appropriate technique available to substitute for the strenuous handwork of spreading green mulch. The main subject of this research report is the technique of green mulch spreading. Between 1994 and 1997, a green mulch spreading prototype was developed and tested. An evaluation of four different spreading techniques, including the prototype, revealed that the optimal technique was still not found and that none of the techniques considered in this report achieved the quality of hand work. The prototype did, however, allow us to perform experiments using different green mulch crops and/or mixtures of green mulch crops to a greater extent. From 1996 - 1999 experiments were conducted using the following crops as <b>green</b> mulch: <b>rye</b> Secale cereale, red clover Trifolium pratense, alfalfa Medicago sativa, timothy Phleum pratense, meadow fescue Festuca pratensis, reed canary grass Phalaris arundinaceae and different mixtures of them. Green mulch was applied to following cash crops: Cabbage Brassica oleracea var. capitata, burdock Arctium lappa, valerian Valeriana, peppermint Mentha piperita, anise hyssop Agastache foeniculum, stinging nettle Urtica dioica, spring wheat Triticum aestivum, and spring barley Hordeum vulgare. The experiments produced the following results: 1) The fertilising effect of green mulch application is ambiguous. 2) Weather conditions influence both the mineralisation and the quantity of green mulch, the timing, and the frequency of mulching. 3) Persisting green mulch cover can be achieved using rye or reed canary grass. 4) An area ratio of 4 : 1 green mulch crop : cash crop seems to be sufficient for weed control. 5) With the exception of wet young red clover, all of the green mulch crops used were suitable for the prototype machine. On condition that the weather is suitable, the strip intercropping technique in combination with the row mulching machine of Fischer Ltd. is presently the best available green mulch spreading-technique. Only zero traffic technology such as gantry technology offers perfect green mulch spreading which is independent from weather and soil conditions. However, even improved spreading technique does not solve the other problem, which is caused by weather conditions: Uncertain growth and mineralisation of green mulch. This is mainly a problem in North European countries where conditions are the opposite of those in tropical areas. In tropical areas, temperature and humidity always ensure both, vigorous growth and rapid mineralisation. In any event, a legume-rich crop rotation and organic manure from livestock would be the better alternative for fertilisation in organic farming under North European conditions. Another alternative is the use of milled seeds of legumes, hornmeal or cake of Ricinus communis. For these materials, traditional fertilising machinery is available. The application of these organic fertilisers is not weather dependent and they can be produced and purchased far from the location of application. The worldwide application of green mulch is essential for a sustainable agriculture. Although in most tropical countries spreading is still done by hand, the mechanisation of green mulch spreading will gain increasing importance in the near future.

[...] Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, [...] screams, weeps, [...] Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are [...] scatter'd, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel, [...] Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to [...] the mare, where the cock is treading the hen, [...] Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks, [...] Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie, [...] Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles [...] far and near, [...] Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived [...] swan is curving and winding, [...] Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her [...] near-human laugh, [...] Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the [...] high weeds, [...] Where band-neck'd partridges roost in a ring on the ground with [...] their heads out, [...] Where burial coaches enter the arch'd gates of a cemetery, [...] Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees, [...] Where the yellow-crown'd heron comes to the edge of the marsh at [...] night and feeds upon small crabs, [...] Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon, [...] Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over [...] the well, [...] Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves, [...] Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs, [...] Through the gymnasium, through the curtain'd saloon, through the [...] office or public hall; [...] Pleas'd with the native and pleas'd with the foreign, pleas'd with [...] the new and old, [...] Pleas'd with the homely woman as well as the handsome, [...] Pleas'd with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously, [...] Pleas'd with the tune of the choir of the whitewash'd church, [...] Pleas'd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, [...] impress'd seriously at the camp-meeting; [...] Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, [...] flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass, [...] Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn'd up to the clouds, [...] or down a lane or along the beach, [...] My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle; [...] Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek'd bush-boy, (behind me [...] he rides at the drape of the day,) [...] Far from the settlements studying the print of animals' feet, or the [...] moccasin print, [...] By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient, [...] Nigh the coffin'd corpse when all is still, examining with a candle; [...] Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure, [...] Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any, [...] Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him, [...] Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while, [...] Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side, [...] Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars, [...] Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the [...] diameter of eighty thousand miles, [...] Speeding with tail'd meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest, [...] Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly, [...] Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning, [...] Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing, [...] I tread day and night such roads.|$|R
