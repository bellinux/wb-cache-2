We determined the effects of 4 different warm-up protocols followed by 20 minutes of basketball activity on flexibility and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Subjects participated in 6 weeks (2 times per week) of warm-up and basketball activity. The warm-up groups participated in ballistic stretching, static stretching, sprinting, or basketball shooting (control group). We asked 3 questions. First, what effect does 6 weeks of warm-up exercise and basketball play have on both flexibility and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height?</b> We <b>measured</b> sit and reach and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> before (week - 1) and after (week 7) the 6 weeks. Flexibility increased for the ballistic, static, and sprint groups compared to the control group (p 3 ̆c 0. 0001), while vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> did not change for any of the groups. Our second question was what is the acute effect of each warm-up on vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height?</b> We <b>measured</b> vertical <b>jump</b> immediately after the warm-up on 4 separate occasions during the 6 weeks (at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6). Vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was not different for any group. Finally, our third question was what is the acute effect of each warm-up on vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> following 20 minutes of basketball play? We <b>measured</b> vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> immediately following 20 minutes of basketball play at weeks 0, 2, 4, and 6. Only the ballistic stretching group demonstrated an acute increase in vertical jump 20 minutes after basketball play (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Coaches should consider using ballistic stretching as a warm-up for basketball play, as it is beneficial to vertical jump performance...|$|R
40|$|Common {{methods to}} {{estimate}} vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (VJH) {{are based on}} the measurements of flight time (FT) or vertical reaction force. This study aimed to assess the measurement errors when estimating the VJH with flight time using photocell devices in comparison with the gold standard <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> <b>measured</b> by a force plate (FP). The second purpose was to determine the intrinsic reliability of the Optojump photoelectric cells in estimating VJH. For this aim, 20 subjects (age: 22. 50 ± 1. 24 years) performed maximal vertical jumps in three modalities in randomized order: the squat jump (SJ), counter-movement jump (CMJ), and CMJ with arm swing (CMJarm). Each trial was simultaneously recorded by the FP and Optojump devices. High intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) for validity (0. 98 - 0. 99) and low limits of agreement (less than 1. 4 cm) were found; even a systematic difference in <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was consistently observed between FT and double integration of force methods (- 31 % to - 27 %; p 1. 2). Intra-session reliability of Optojump was excellent, with ICCs ranging from 0. 98 to 0. 99, low coefficients of variation (3. 98 %), and low standard errors of measurement (0. 8 cm). It was concluded that there was a high correlation between the two methods to estimate the vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height,</b> but the FT method cannot replace the gold standard, due to the large systematic bias. According to our results, the equations of each of the three jump modalities were presented in order to obtain a better estimation of the <b>jump</b> <b>height...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between lower limb strength and two Australian football (AF) skills were assessed for 19 sub-elite AF players. Knee extension (KE) and knee flexion (KF) strength were assessed using a Biodex isokinetic dynamometer at angular velocities of 60, 240 and 360 degrees/sec. The two AF skills evaluated were running vertical jump (VJ) and kicking performance (KP). VJ performance {{was defined as}} the maximal <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> <b>measured</b> with a Yardstick device. KP was gauged through video analysis, as the post-contact resultant ball velocity (BV) during maximal effort drop punt kicking. Strength was measured as the isokinetic peak torque (PT value. No significant correlations were detected between the isokinetic knee strength values and maximal kicking velocity. Low to moderate significant correlations (r = 0. 55 - 0. 69, p < 0. 05) were detected between the isokinetic <b>measures</b> and VJ <b>height.</b> It may be inferred that additional strengthening of the knee musculature may enhance running VJ performance, but not necessarily kicking velocity for this group of sub-elite AF players...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between vertical jump measures and sprint speed over 10, 20, and 40 m in professional basketball players. Thirty-three professional basketball players aged (±SD) (27. 4 ± 3. 3 years), body mass (89. 8 ± 11. 1 kg), and stature (192 ± 8. 2 cm) volunteered to participate in this study. All participants were tested on squat jump, countermovement jump, and 40 -m running speed. The results show that all jump measures in absolute terms were correlated significantly to running performance over 10 -, 20 -, and 40 -m sprint times. None of the jumping performance peak powers and reactive strength were found to have a correlation to running speed times in absolute term. Furthermore, all <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> <b>measures</b> relative to body mass except reactive strength had a marked and significant relationship with all sprint performance times. The results of this study indicate that while there is a strong and marked relationship between 10 -, 20 -, and 40 -m sprint, there is also a considerable variation within the factors that contribute to performance over these distances.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} whether a deep squat depth can improve vertical counter-movement <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> as predicted by theoretical models after a training period for neuromusclar adaptation. Five male subjects peformed a baseline test of vertical counter-movement jump performance using their normal and a deeper squat depths. <b>Jump</b> <b>height</b> was <b>measured</b> by the centre of mass displacement using a motion capture system. After that, they underwent three weeks of daily training (2 sets of 10 deep jumps) before returning for a post-test. Overall, subjects jumped higher in the deep compared with the normal positions on both days (pre-test: normal= 52. 8 cm, deep= 55. 5 cm; post-test: normal= 55. 8 cm, deep= 58. 3 cm). There were, however, large variations in individual response to training and squath depth. KEY WORDS: neuromuscular adaptation, training, deep squat. INTRODUCTION: The vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> achieved in flight is determined by the impulse generated during the ground contact for standing jumps. Adopting a deeper squat position may potentially enhance jumping performance due to the longer time available for muscles to generate force.

We aimed to compare age- and gender- related trends in countermovement vertical jump (CMJ) performance (<b>jumping</b> <b>height)</b> <b>measured</b> with a means of ground force plate during a longitudinal study of 4 - to 6 -year old children (N= 79; 43 % boys). Furthermore, we classified children CMJ arm-leg coordination into poor, average, or excellent on the grounds of high speed video footage. We found that CMJ height progresses significantly with age when arms are used (P<. 001, η 2 =. 632) and without the use of arms (P<. 001, η 2 =. 620). There were no sex effects. After classification of CMJ arm - leg coordination we found that children with excellent CMJ coordination progress more intensively than those with average coordination, whereas poorly coordinated jumpers do not progress at all. After extrapolating our data with the data of others, we found logarithmic CMJ height trends until the age of 16 in both sexes, athlete boys jumping higher than the non-athletes after the ages of 14 or 15. It seems that the initial movement patterns level, in this case the observed jumping technic, develops and refines in 4 - to 6 -year old children at that age. We conclude that jumping coordination is a very important factor of CMJ performance in the studied age span...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} {{the effects of a}} therapeutic massage on delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle function following downhill walking. Eight male subjects performed a 40 -min downhill treadmill walk loaded with 10 % of their body mass. A qualified masseur performed a 30 -min therapeutic massage to one limb 2 hours post-walk. Muscle soreness, tenderness, isometric strength, isokinetic strength, and single leg vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> were <b>measured</b> on two occasions before, and 1, 24, 72 and 120 hours post-walk for both limbs. Subjects showed significant (p< 0. 004) increases in soreness and tenderness for the non-massaged limb 24 hours post-walk with a significant (p< 0. 001) difference between the two limbs. A significant reduction in isometric strength was recorded for both limbs compared to baseline 1 hour post-walk. Isokinetic strength at 60 °/sec and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> were significantly lower for the massaged limb at 1 and 24 hours post-walk.

40|$|Background: Vitamin D {{deficiency}} {{is common}} in {{the general public and}} athletic populations and may impair skeletal muscle function. We therefore assessed the effects of vitamin D supplementation on serum 25 [OH]D concentrations and physical performance. Methods: 30 club-level athletes were block randomised (using baseline 25 [OH]D concentrations) into one of three groups receiving either a placebo (PLB), 20 000 or 40 000 IU/week oral vitamin D for 12 weeks.

Forty-two healthy, physically active males (aged 18 - 24) voluntarily participated in this investigation and were {{randomly assigned to one of}} three groups (1 set of 20 seconds dynamic stretch, 1 set of 20 second static stretch, or control). The knee and hip range of motion, sit and reach, and <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> were <b>measured</b> before and after the treatment condition. The same measures were performed on the control group that sat for 12 minutes. All subjects began with a five minute warm-up on a cycle ergometer.

40|$|PURPOSE: Patellar tendon {{abnormality}} (PTA) on {{diagnostic imaging}} {{is part of}} the diagnostic criteria for patellar tendinopathy. PTA and altered landing strategies are primary risk factors that increase the likelihood of asymptomatic athletes developing patellar tendinopathy. Therefore, the aim {{of this study was to}} examine the risk factors that are predictors of the presence and severity of a PTA in junior pre-elite athletes. METHODS: Ten junior pre-elite male basketball athletes with a PTA were matched with 10 athletes with normal patellar tendons. Participants had patellar tendon morphology, Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) score, body composition, lower limb flexibility, and maximum vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> <b>measured</b> before performing five successful stop-jump tasks. During each stop-jump task, both two-dimensional and three-dimensional kinematics and ground reaction forces were recorded. Multiple regression analyses were used to identify factors for estimating PTA presence and severity, and discriminate analysis was used to classify PTA presence. RESULTS: Sixty-eight percent of variance for presence of a PTA was accounted for by hip joint range of motion (ROM) and knee joint angle at initial foot-ground contact (IC) during stop-jump task and quadriceps flexibility, whereas hip joint ROM during stop-jump task and VISA score accounted for 62 % of variance for PTA severity. Prediction of the presence of a PTA was achieved with 95 % accuracy and 95 % cross-validation. CONCLUSIONS: An easily implemented, reliable, and valid movement screening tool composed of three criteria enables coaches and/or clinicians to predict the presence and severity of a PTA in asymptomatic athletes. This enables identification of asymptomatic athletes at higher risk of developing patellar tendinopathy, which allows the development of effective preventative measures to aid in the reduction of patellar tendinopathy injury prevalence...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To compare in vivo {{effects of}} {{eccentric}} and concentric calf muscle training on Achilles tendon stiffness, in subjects without tendinopathy. Methods: Thirty-eight recreational athletes completed 6 weeks eccentric (6 males, 13 females, 21. 6 ?±? 2. 2 years) or concentric training (8 males, 11 females, 21. 1 ?±? 2. 0 years). Achilles tendon stiffness, tendon modulus and single-leg <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> were <b>measured</b> {{before and after}} intervention. Exercise adherence was recorded using a diary. Results: All data are reported as mean?±?SD. Groups were matched for height and weight but the eccentric training group were more active at baseline (P?<? 0. 05). Tendon stiffness was higher in the eccentrically trained group at baseline compared to the concentrically trained group (20. 9 ?±? 7. 3 N/mm v 13. 38 ?±? 4. 66 N/mm; P?=? 0. 001) and decreased significantly after eccentric training (to 17. 2 (?±? 5. 9) N/mm (P?=? 0. 035)). There was no stiffness change in the concentric group (P?=? 0. 405). Stiffness modulus showed similar changes to stiffness. An inverse correlation was found between initial, and subsequent, reduction in stiffness (r?=?? 0. 66). <b>Jump</b> <b>height</b> did not change and no correlation between stiffness change and adherence was observed in either group (r?=? 0. 01). Conclusions: Six weeks of eccentric training can alter Achilles tendon stiffness while a matched concentric programme shows no similar effects.

Background: Quadriceps {{strength}} {{is associated with}} hop distance and <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in persons who have undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR). However, it is unknown whether the ability to rapidly generate quadriceps torque in the early phase of recovery is associated with future hopping and jumping performance in this population. Objective: To evaluate the prospective associations among quadriceps strength and rate of torque development (RTD) and single-leg hop for distance, vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height,</b> vertical ground reaction force (vGRF), and vertical force loading rate during a landing task in persons who have undergone ACLR. Methods: Seventy patients with unilateral ACLR participated. At 6 weeks post ACLR, isometric quadriceps strength and RTD were measured using a dynamometer. At 6 months post ACLR, patients performed the single-leg hop-for-distance test. Patients also performed the single-leg vertical jump test on a forceplate which <b>measured</b> maximum <b>jump</b> <b>height,</b> vGRF, and average loading rate during landing. Results: Both quadriceps strength and RTD at 6 weeks post ACLR were associated with all hopping and jumping measures at 6 months post ACLR (P≤ 0. 04). Single-leg hop distance was associated more closely with quadriceps strength than with quadriceps RTD (P= 0. 05) whereas vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> and vGRF <b>measures</b> were associated more closely with quadriceps RTD than with quadriceps strength (P= 0. 05 and P< 0. 01, respectively).

In total, 64 8 – 11 -year-old schoolchildren (27 boys and 37 girls) were studied. All children were at Tanner stage 1. The subjects’ height and body mass were measured and BMI calculated. The following anthropometric parameters directly connected with leg were measured: skinfolds – front thigh and medial calf; girths – gluteal, thigh, mid-thigh, calf and ankle; lengths – iliospinale height, trochanterion height, trochanteriontibiale laterale, tibiale-laterale height and tibiale mediale-spyrion tibiale; and breadths – biiliocristal, foot length and biepicondylar femur. Total body and legs fat mass and fat %, lean body mass (LBM) and both legs BMD were measured by DXA. Maximal <b>jumping</b> <b>height</b> was <b>measured</b> on the contact mat. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated that body height in boys (54. 6 %; R 2 x 100) and body mass in girls (57. 3 %) were the most important basic anthropometric parameters that influenced BMD in legs. From the measured skinfolds, that of the front thigh characterized legs BMD by 24. 9 – 35. 6 %. From the girths, the most important parameter to characterize legs BMD was that of calf (50. 0 – 59. 1 %). Tibiale laterale height was the only length parameter which was highly related with legs BMD (51. 1 – 54. 5 %). Biepicondylar femur was the most important breadth parameter which characterized legs BMD (51. 0 – 54. 8 %).

40|$|Background: Extensive {{literature}} has described {{a decrease in}} force output performance in the local muscle groups after static stretching, and static stretching has therefore been recommended not to be performed during warm-ups. A recent study showed evidence of a cross-over effect in regard to static stretching, i. e. non-local muscles were also affected by static stretching. This result could however be due to fatigue in the muscle groups stretched, and a fatigued condition has previously shown cross-over effects in several studies. Aim: The aim {{of the study was}} to (1) examine if upper-limb static stretching and muscle fatigue display a cross-over effect that show changes in force output in the lower limbs, and (2) if there was a difference between the effects of the static stretch protocol and the muscle fatigue protocol for the purpose of examining if fatigue is the larger factor for cross-over. Methods: Concentric maximal <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> of 15 subjects with previous strength training experience of at least one year was measured and the subjects subsequently performed both intervention protocols in a random order. After each protocol concentric <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was <b>measured</b> again. The static stretch protocol consisted of a static stretch for the shoulder at an intensity of “Very hard”, 10 repetitions of 30 second stretches with 15 seconds rest in between repetitions. The muscle fatigue protocol consisted of 10 repetitions of 30 seconds isometric muscle contraction in the same position with 15 seconds rest between repetitions at an intensity of “Very hard”. The data was collected on an infra-red contact mat and differences between the mean <b>jump</b> <b>heights</b> pre- and post each protocol and between the different protocols were analyzed with pair sample t-test.   Result: Mean concentric <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (± standard deviation, SD) was 25. 31 (± 9. 4) cm for the baseline jumps, 23. 66 (± 8. 89) cm post static stretch intervention jumps and 24. 13 (± 8. 90) cm post muscle fatigue intervention jumps. This indicates a cross-over effect on force output in the legs post static stretching with a mean reduction of 1. 65 cm (p= 0. 001). Upper-limb muscle fatigue indicated a cross-over effect on force output in the legs with a mean reduction of 1. 18 cm (p= 0. 032). There was no statistical significance between the two protocols (p= 0. 146). Conclusion: The results presented a cross-over effect on both conditions. This is in line with previous research in the area. The results implicate that static stretching and muscle fatigue effects the central nervous system, which can lead to impairments in performance in non-local muscles. This can be considered in warm-up and exercise program design when force output is of great importance for performanc...|$|R
40|$|Young {{soccer players}} are usually trained with adult-training methods, {{even though the}} {{physiological}} adaptations {{are likely to be}} very different compared with adults. In contrast, some have suggested training preadolescents only with coordination training. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate whether coordination or repeatedsprint training better improved speed over 20 m, with and without the ball. Sixteen soccer players (mean age 11 ± 0. 5 y) were randomly assigned to a sprint-training group (STG = 7) or a coordination-training group (CTG = 9). The STG trained twice a week for 12 wk and performed 20 repetitions of 20 - and 10 -m sprints; the CTG performed coordination training (eg, speed ladder running) for the same training duration. Maximal <b>jump</b> <b>height,</b> anthropometric <b>measures,</b> and 20 -m sprint time, with and without ball, were evaluated before and after the training period. Statistical significance was determined using two-way ANOVA with repeated measure and Pearson test for correlation. Both groups improved speed without the ball: STG = 3. 75 ± 0. 10 s to 3. 66 ± 0. 09 s (P . 05) for STG and 4. 04 ± 0. 12 s and 3. 82 ± 0. 15 s (P <. 05) for CTG, with a significant difference between groups posttraining (P <. 05). There were significant correlations between sprint time without ball, CMJ, and SJ. These data suggest that coordination training increases the speed with the ball more than typical repeated-sprint training. It can be hypothesized that running speed with ball improved more in CTG because this particular action requires improvements in coordination...|$|R
40|$|Protein {{glycosylation}} via O-linked N-acetylglucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) is {{an important}} post-translational regulatory mechanism mediated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT) and responsive to nutrients and stress. OGT attaches an O-GlcNAc moiety to proteins, while O-GlcNAcase (OGA) catalyzes O-GlcNAc removal. In skeletal muscle of experimental animals, prolonged increase in O-GlcNAcylation associates with age and muscle atrophy. Here we {{examined the effects of}} hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and power training (PT) on muscle OGT and OGA gene expression in postmenopausal women generally prone to age-related muscle weakness. In addition, the associations of OGT and OGA gene expressions with muscle phenotype were analyzed. Twenty-seven 50 - 57 -year-old women participated in a yearlong randomized placebo-controlled trial: HRT (n = 10), PT (n = 8) and control (n = 9). OGT and OGA mRNA levels were measured from muscle samples obtained at baseline and after one year. Knee extensor muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), knee extension force, running speed and vertical <b>jumping</b> <b>height</b> were <b>measured.</b> During the yearlong intervention, HRT suppressed the aging-associated upregulation of OGT mRNA that occurred in the controls. The effects of PT were similar but weaker. HRT also tended to increase the OGA mRNA level compared to the controls. The change in the ratio of OGT to OGA gene expressions correlated negatively with the change in muscle CSA. Our results suggest that OGT and OGA gene expressions are associated with muscle size during the critical postmenopausal period. HRT and PT influence muscle OGT and OGA gene expression, which {{may be one of the}} mechanisms by which HRT and PT prevent aging-related loss of muscle mass...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{study was}} {{performed}} to determine relationship between anthropometric properties with vertical jump on 40 male elite volleyball players (27. 93 ± 3. 92 years old and 8 ± 1. 53 years sport history) in Iran premier league. 42 anthropometric parameters were measured using caliper and flexible tape meter (JAMAR STAINLESS®). In order to decrease parameters covering the same measurements among 42 anthropometric properties, multiple correlation were applied and parameters with coefficient higher than 0. 8 were selected for further analysis, so number of parameters decreased to 17. Using principle component analysis method on 17 parameters, three main components including 70 % of data variance were extracted. In the main components, parameters with coefficient more than 0. 7 including weight, seated height in fixture, shank length, foot length, torso circumference at hip level, maximum calf circumference, abdomen fat, middle tight circumference and tight length were used for further analysis. The difference in distance between the standing reach <b>height</b> and the <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was <b>measured</b> as the vertical jump records. To determine differences between vertical jump records and also relationship between anthropometric properties with vertical jumps, one way variance analysis (F- Test) and regression coefficients were used. There are significant differences between vertical jump of spikers and liberos, also between setters and liberos, {{but there are no}} significant differences between vertical jump of spikers and setters. There is significant relationship between vertical jumps with shank length, maximum calf circumference, foot length for spikers and setters, also tight circumference and weight for liberos...|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine the effect of short-term high-impact jump activity on bone turnover in female college-aged non-athletes. Twenty six healthy females were randomly assigned to a control or jump group. The subjects jumped 5 days per week for 2 weeks. The participants completed 10 jumps per session. A general health questionnaire and a bone-specific physical activity assessment instrument (BPAQ) were completed. BPAQ scores were calculated based on the past history of exercise. Blood draws were taken in both groups before and after the two-week experimental period. The vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) of all <b>jumps</b> and <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> were <b>measured</b> for each subject daily and the osteogenic index (OI) was measured. Concentrations of serum osteocalcin (OC), Bone Specific Alkaline Phosphatase (BAP), C-Terminal Telopeptides of Type I Collagen (CTX) and plasma Tartrate-Resistant Acid Phosphatase (TRAP 5 b) were assessed pre and post jump protocol to measure bone formation and resoprtion respectively. A significant interaction (time x group) was found in TRAP 5 b, and BAP values (p < 0. 05). There was a significant decrease in CTX and BAP values in the jump group (p < 0. 05) after the two week jump protocol. No significant interactions or changes were observed in OC values for either the jump or the control group. Two weeks of jump activity consisting of 10 jumps/day for 5 days/week with a weekly osteogenic index of 52. 6 significantly decreased markers of bone resorption (TRAP 5 b and CTX) and bone formation (BAP) in young female non- athletes...|$|R

A vertical leap in basketball also involves rapid & repeated muscle contraction & stretching. Various {{methods have been}} used to improve the vertical leap in players, but only few studies mention about plyometrics. Aim: To determine the effect of Plyometric training on vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in high school basketball players & compare them with their untrained counterparts. Methods and Materials: 144 students were randomly selected & distributed in Group I (Pre-pubertal) & Group II (Pubertal) which was further divided into Group A (trained players) & Group B (untrained students). A gender wise distribution followed this. Plyometric training of 6 weeks was conducted & the vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> pre & post training were recorded & compared. Results: Vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> improved significantly post Plyometric in Group Bcompared to Group A. Boys showed improvement in Group B, however girls were better in Group A. Correlation of BMI with vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was negative & significant in Group B. Conclusion: Plyometric training brought significant change in untrained students.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{efficacy}} of lower limb compression garments on recovery in club level rugby players. Nineteen participants (age, 20. 3 ± 1. 7 years, height, 184. 2 ± 7. 5 cm and body mass, 89. 5 ± 9. 9 kg) completed a rugby specific, muscle damaging protocol before being assigned to a compression garment group (n = 10) or a SHAM ("recovery" drink) treatment (n = 9). The compression group wore the garments for 48 h post-exercise, while SHAM consumed a sweetened, low energy drink within an hour of protocol completion. Perceived muscle soreness (PMS), Creatine Kinase (CK), maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) and countermovement <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (CMJ) were <b>measured</b> at baseline, post, 24 and 48 h post-exercise. Perceived muscle soreness was significantly lower in the compression group compared to SHAM at both 24 and 48 h post-exercise (p ≤ 0. 05). The compression group was also subject to lower CK values than SHAM, as demonstrated by a significant time by group effect (p ≤ 0. 05). There was no significant group effect for MVIC or CMJ (p > 0. 05). Wearing compression garments following a rugby specific, muscle damaging protocol appears to reduce PMS and circulating concentrations of CK, suggesting improved recovery from muscle damaging exercise...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine the effects of {{different}} sport surfaces on athletic performance by means of muscle performance. Twenty two elite male basketball players, aged between 17 and 28, participated in this study. This study was executed on 7 different sport surfaces: asphalt, synthetic grass, natural grass, tile powder, soil, wooden parquet and EPDM (Ethylene Propylene Diene Monomer). Leg strength (LS) and vertical <b>jumping</b> <b>height</b> (VJH) were <b>measured</b> at rest and after a given training protocol on each surface. Surface compliance was evaluated with a drop test using a medicine ball. Asphalt and synthetic grass were the most fatiguing, natural grass, soil and tile powder were moderately fatiguing, parquet and EPDM were the least fatiguing surfaces. The results of surface compliance were inconsistent with those obtained in LS and VJH tests. As the compliance of the surface increased LS and VJH increased, i. e. performance was decreased. The results {{of the present study}} suggest that it is better to use parquet and EPDM in construction of indoor sport surfaces. On the other hand, it may be appropriate to build outdoor surfaces with natural grass because of its aesthetic and visual impacts and its contribution to the amount of urban green area...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} the effects of carbohydrate and caffeine ingestion on simulated rugby league interchange performance. Eight male elite rugby league forwards completed two trials of a rugby league simulation protocol for interchange players seven days apart in a randomized crossover design, ingesting either carbohydrate (CHO; 40 g·h- 1) or carbohydrate and caffeine (CHO-C) (40 g·h- 1 + 3 mg·kg- 1) drink. Movement characteristics, heart rate, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and countermovement <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (CMJ) were <b>measured</b> during the protocol. CHO-C resulted in likely to very likely higher mean running speeds (ES 0. 43 to 0. 75), distance in high intensity running (ES 0. 41 to 0. 64) and mean sprint speeds (ES 0. 39 to 1. 04) compared to CHO. Heart rate was possibly to very likely higher (ES 0. 32 to 0. 74) and RPE was likely to very likely lower (ES - 0. 53 to 0. 86) with CHO-C. There was a likely trivial to possibly higher CMJ in CHO-C compared to CHO (ES 0. 07 to 0. 25). The co-ingestion of carbohydrate with caffeine has an ergogenic effect to reduce the sense of effort and increase high intensity running capability that might be employed to enhance interchange running performance in elite rugby league players...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Hamstring strains {{are among}} {{one of the}} most common acute {{injuries}} that occur in soccer players. Previous research has shown that reduced hamstring flexibility is a risk factor for injury, however this is modifiable through stretching. Some stretching techniques have contributed to decreased performance on measures important to success in sport. Proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) is one effective stretching technique to improve hamstring flexibility, but requires a trained partner or clinician to perform properly. It is unknown if the performance of PNF stretching without a clinician’s assistance could be as effective. It is also unknown if PNF stretching affects soccer related performance outcomes of force output and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Objective: To determine the effects of clinician assisted versus unassisted contract-relax PNF stretching on hamstring flexibility, maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVIC) of the hamstring muscle group, and athletic performance via vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Design: Controlled laboratory study. Participants: A sample of twenty-six physically active male and female college students with restricted hamstring flexibility, defined as limited passive hip flexion range of motion with the leg straight (3 ̆c 90 degrees), participated in this study. Procedures: Subjects were randomly allocated to one of three groups; the clinician assisted, unassisted, or control groups following confirmation of inclusion criteria. The control group completed pre- and post- test measures only. The intervention groups completed a 6 -week stretching intervention (12 total sessions) either with the assistance of a clinician or utilizing a stretching strap. Pre- and Post- intervention measurements were recorded for all outcome variables. Main Outcome Measures: Hip flexion range of motion was measured passively with the knee extended. Hamstring MVIC was assessed using a handheld dynamometer and normalized to each participant’s body mass. Maximal vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was <b>measured</b> using a Vertec. Three trials were recorded for each measure and the arithmetic mean was used to calculate change scores (Post – Pre). Change scores were utilized for data analysis. Separate one-way ANOVA’s were performed to identify differences between groups in the magnitude of change. Results: The one-way ANOVA for hip flexion ROM change scores was significant (F (2, 25) = 9. 853, p = 0. 001), indicating there were significant differences in the amount of change in ROM when compared across groups. Post-hoc comparisons found both the Unassisted (10. 26 ° ± 6. 03, p = 0. 002) and Assisted (10. 27 ° ± 3. 81, p = 0. 004) PNF intervention groups had a greater improvement in ROM compared to the Control group (- 0. 41 ° ± 7. 00). There were no differences between the amount of change in the Unassisted group compared to the Assisted group. The one-way ANOVA found no significant changes in MVIC (F (2, 25) = 2. 542, p = 0. 101), and vertical <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (F (2, 25) = 0. 133, p = 0. 877). Conclusion: Both the Assisted and Unassisted PNF stretching techniques were successful in improving hamstring flexibility. Performance measures were not impacted by the stretching intervention. Teaching a patient to perform the contract-relax PNF stretching technique to target hamstring flexibility is as effective as the clinician providing the assistance. These results may provide time saving benefits to clinicians while promoting improved flexibility and independence in patients...|$|R

40|$|Plyometrics {{has been}} widely researched, finding it an {{effective}} method for improving <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> and lower body power. It has not however been researched as a trampoline specific strength and conditioning intervention. Aim: This study aims to assess {{the effectiveness of a}} six-week plyometric program on the lower body power and on trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in trampoline gymnasts. Method: In a mixed experimental study 19 competitive trampolinists (16 ± 3 years) were assigned to either a control or plyometric training group. The training group performed a progressive 6 -week plyometric intervention, whilst the control group performed no plyometrics. All participants were tested pre- and post-intervention. Force plates were used to assess <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> and impulse of countermovement (CMJ) and squat jumps (SJ). Trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> was assessed using time of flight (ToF) of 10 straight jumps. Data was analysed for differences between pre- and post-testing measures. Results: No significant differences were found, in neither lower body power (p> 0. 05) nor trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> (p> 0. 05), between pre- and post-testing in the control group. The training group showed no significant difference in trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> between pre- and post-testing (p> 0. 05). The training group showed significant increases in power, with both significantly increased CMJ and SJ height (p< 0. 05) and impulse (p< 0. 05), between pre- and post-testing. Conclusion: Results suggest that a 6 -week plyometric training program was effective for significantly improving trampolinists lower body power on the floor. However, the plyometrics did not cause significant improvements on the trampoline, with no increases in trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Future research needs to further validate these findings, with greater sample sizes, as well as further investigation into the physiological demands of trampolining. Additionally, investigation of plyometrics on compliant surfaces would be beneficial due to the greater similarity to trampoline training and potential greater improvements in trampoline <b>jump</b> <b>height...</b>|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{investigating}} the biomechanical {{factors associated with}} maximal countermovement <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> have typically utilised cross-sectional data. An alternative but less common approach is to use pre-to-post training change data, where the relationship between an improvement in <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> and a change in a factor is examined more directly. Our study compared the findings of these approaches. Such an evaluation is necessary because cross-sectional studies are currently a primary source of information for coaches when examining what factors to train to enhance performance. The countermovement jump of forty four males was analysed before and after an eight week training intervention. Correlations with <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> were calculated using both cross-sectional (pre-training data only) and pre-to-post training change data. Eight factors identified in the cross-sectional analysis were not significantly correlated with a change in <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> in the pre-to-post analysis. Additionally, only six of eleven factors identified in the pre-to-post analysis were identified in the cross-sectional analysis. These findings imply that: (a) not all factors identified in a cross-sectional analysis may be critical to <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> improvement, and (b) cross-sectional analyses alone may not provide an insight into all of the potential factors to train to enhance <b>jump</b> <b>height.</b> Coaches {{must be aware of}} these limitations when examining cross-sectional studies to identify factors to train to enhance jump ability. Additional findings highlight that while exercises prescribed to improve <b>jump</b> <b>height</b> should aim to enhance concentric power production at all joints, a particular emphasis on enhancing hip joint peak power may be warranted...|$|R
