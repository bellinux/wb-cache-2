40|$|In {{this article}} we examine the {{transient}} performance of a <b>flexible</b> <b>machine</b> <b>centre</b> that processes several classes of jobs with significant setup times and with priority scheduling. Our {{results show that the}} transient performance of the system over typical observation intervals can be significantly different from the performance predicted by steady-state analysis. The <b>machine</b> <b>centre</b> serves three classes of jobs [...] class 1, class 2 and class 3 : class 3 jobs have non-preemptive priority over jobs of class 1 and class 2. The results show that the throughput and cycle time of class 1 and class 2 jobs are affected quite dramatically by the arrival of class 3 jobs. However, over a typical observation period in the initial evolution of the system, steady-state results overestimate this effect of the high priority jobs whereas the more credible estimates are given by transient analysis. The transient analysis is carded out by solving explicitly the corresponding Markov chains, using a higher level stochastic Petri net model to generate the Markov chains...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a framework for}} the concurrent modelling of workpieces and cutting tools (dual flow) and introduces a computer aided tool, the dual-flow emulator, {{for use in the}} initial investment phase of high-cost <b>flexible</b> <b>machining</b> cells (FMC) and their subsequent short-term scheduling. This facility enables designers to make decisions based on the economic performance and enhancement of proposed designs. The focus of the work is on machining cells, where an individual <b>machining</b> <b>centre's</b> cost can be in excess of one million pounds, with the tooling being three/four times more expensive than conventional tooling. With these high-cost investments, where there is a small number of expensive machines, it is essential that designers are assured a greater chance of economic success. This makes it necessary to model both the flow and management of the workpieces and cutting tools. A framework for the concurrent modelling of workpieces and cutting tools (dual flow) is introduced and the dual-flow emulator described. This dual-flow emulator can be used to explore the relative merits of alternative operating strategies and, finally, as a short-term scheduling tool as an operational performance aid. An industrial-based study has been undertaken and the economic performance of two strategies is discussed in terms of the overall specification and operational performanc...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the {{availability}} and productivity of manufacturing systems, process monitoring has become an important matter in modern automated plants. The traditional monitoring technologies are based on single sensors and are insufficient, especially for manufacturing processes of highly complicated and automated systems. Instead, multi-sensor based technologies are developing rapidly and are widely used for such monitoring tasks. This paper introduces a multi-sensor based process monitoring system for an existing <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The system can monitor the major manufacturing process faults or abnormalities of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> and provide maintenance planning through measuring and analysing multiple sensor parameters such as power, vibration, temperature and pressure of spindle, feed axes, and hydraulic and pneumatic systems of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre.</b> The general structure of the monitoring system and {{the implementation of the}} main steps of the monitoring system development are presented in detail...|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This thesis outlines the evolution of computer hardware and software architectures which are suitable for the programming and control of modular robots and distributed manipulators. Fundamental aspects of automating manufacturing functions are considered {{and the use of}} <b>flexible</b> <b>machines,</b> constructed from components of a family of mechanical modules and associated control system elements, are proposed. Many of the features of these <b>flexible</b> <b>machines</b> can be identified with those of conventional industrial robots. However a broader class of manufacturing machine is represented in as much as the industrial user defines the kinematics and dynamics of the manipulator. Such <b>flexible</b> <b>machines</b> can be referred to as "modular robots" or, where the mechanical modules are arranged in concurrently operating but mechanically decoupled groups, as "distributed manipulators". The main body of the work reported centred on the design of a family of computer control system elements which can serve a range of distributed manipulator and modular robot forms. These control system elements, whose cost is commensurate with the size and complexity of the manipulator's mechanical configuration, necessarily have many of the features found in robot controllers but also require properties of reconfigurability, programmability, and control system performance for the considerable array of manipulator configurations which can be constructed [continued] [...] ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceKey {{performances}} of industrial {{systems can be}} characterised by performances both related to the system itself but also the product/service it is delivering. It can be particularised in the manufacturing domain, by the performances related to the part manufactured (e. g. dimensional deviation, surface roughness) and to the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> (e. g. productivity, availability). The mastering of {{these two types of}} performances is nowadays mostly considerate separately, in the sense that current approaches lead to control product or machine performances mainly in an isolated way. Only few approaches try to take them into account jointly to permit to control {{performances of}} one thanks to the control of performances of the other and this all along the time. Thus a challenge in manufacturing {{is to be able to}} control part deviations from the mastering of the <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> degradation. In that way, this paper is first proposing a review on current approaches able to support these two performance considerations and then to investigate scientifically, in the frame of automotive sector, a specific approach able to control part performances directly from <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a simulation study of a typical flexible manufacturing system (FMS) that has routing flexibility. The objective in this study is to test the effectiveness of the modified dissimilarity maximization method (modified DMM) for real time FMS scheduling. modified DMM method is an improvement of the DMM method. Modified DMM method is an alternative process plan selection method developed for routing selection in real time FMS scheduling. A computer simulation model, which mimics a physical system, is used to evaluate the effect of DMM and Modified DMM rules on the system performance. The typical FMS employed in this study includes seven <b>machining</b> <b>centres,</b> a loading and unloading area, and six different part types. The part type has alternative routings because of the existence of identical <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> in the system. The DMM and Modified DMM are used for selecting an incoming part and later routing it to a <b>machining</b> <b>centre</b> for its next operation. The result show that the Modified DMM outperforms DMM on system throughput in saturation case, increases utilization of the machines and increases utilization of the handling system...|$|R
