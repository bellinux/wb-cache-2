40|$|Gaussian beams {{are often}} used in optical systems. The {{fundamental}} Gaussian TEM 00 mode {{is the most common}} of the Gaussian modes present in various optical devices, systems and equipment. Within an optical system, it is common that this Gaussian TEM 00 beam passes through a <b>circular</b> <b>aperture</b> of a finite diameter. Such <b>circular</b> <b>apertures</b> include irises, spatial filters, circular Photo-Detectors (PDs) and optical mounts with circular rims. The magnitude of optical power passing through a finite-sized <b>circular</b> <b>aperture</b> is well-documented for cases where the Gaussian beam passes {{through the center of the}} clear <b>circular</b> <b>aperture,</b> and is chopped off symmetrically in all radial directions on a given plane. More often than not, a non-axial incident Gaussian Beam is not blocked in a radially uniform manner by a <b>circular</b> <b>aperture.</b> Such situations arise due to a lateral displacement of the beam from tilted glass blocks, manufacturing errors and imperfect surface flatness or parallelness of surfaces. The fraction of optical power of a laterally-shifted Gaussian Beam passing through a <b>circular</b> <b>aperture</b> is calculated in this paper through conventional integration techniques.
