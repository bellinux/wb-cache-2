2500|$|The Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh {{arrived in}} England on 7 March 1874. The town of Windsor was {{decorated}} in their honour, with Union Jacks and Russian flags, and Maria {{was given a}} great welcome by the waiting crowds. Queen Victoria met them at the South-Western Station and recorded their arrival in her journal: [...] "I took dear Marie <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> kissed her warmly several times. I was quite nervous and trembling, so long had I been in expectation ... Dear Marie has a very friendly manner, a pleasant face, beautiful skin and fine bright eyes ... She speaks English wonderfully well." [...] Later on, [...] Queen Victoria described her new daughter-in-law as [...] "most pleasing natural, unaffected and civil" [...] even if [...] "she was not pretty or graceful and held herself badly". [...] "I have formed a high opinion of her," [...] Queen Victoria reported, impressed with [...] "her wonderfully even, cheerful, satisfied temper – her kind and indulgent disposition, free from bigotry and intolerance, and her serious, intelligent mind – so entirely free from everything fast – and so full of occupation and interest in everything, makes her a most agreeable companion. Everyone must like her." [...] The queen also noted that Marie was [...] "not a bit afraid of Affie and I hope will have the very best influence upon him." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 13, 1920, Pickford {{gave his}} account of that night to the Los Angeles Herald-Examiner:We arrived back at the Ritz hotel at about 3 o'clock in the morning. I had already booked {{airplane}} seats for London. We were going Sunday morning. Both of us were tired out. We both had been drinking a little. I insisted that we had better not pack then, but rather get up early before our trip and do it then. I went to bed immediately. She fussed around and wrote a note to her mother. ... She was in the bathroom.Suddenly she shrieked: 'My God.' I jumped out of bed, rushed toward her and caught her in my arms. She cried to me {{to find out what}} was in the bottle. I picked it up and read: 'Poison.' It was a toilet solution and the label was in French. I realized what she had done and sent for the doctor. Meanwhile, I forced her to drink water in order to make her vomit. She screamed, 'O, my God, I'm poisoned.' I forced the whites of eggs down her throat, hoping to offset the poison. The doctor came. He pumped her stomach three times while I held Olive.Nine o'clock in the morning I got her to the Neuilly Hospital, where Doctors Choate and Wharton took charge of her. They told me she had swallowed bichloride of mercury in an alcoholic solution, which is ten times worse than tablets. She didn't want to die. She took the poison by mistake. We both loved each other since the day we married. The fact that we were separated months at a time made no difference in our affection for each other. She even was conscious enough the day before she died to ask the nurse to come to America with her until she had fully recovered, having no thought she would die.She kept continually calling for me. I was beside her day and night until her death. The physicians held out hope for her until the last moment, until they found her kidneys paralyzed. Then they lost hope. But the doctors told me she had fought harder than any patient they ever had. She held onto her life as only one case in fifty. She seemed stronger the last two days. She was conscious, and said she would get better and go home to her mother. 'It's all a mistake, darling Jack,' she said. But I knew she was dying.She was kept alive only by hypodermic injections during the last twelve hours. I was the last one she recognized. I watched her eyes glaze and realized she was dying. I asked her how she was feeling and she answered: 'Pretty weak, but I'll be all right in a little while, don't worry, darling.' Those were her last words. I held her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> she died an hour later. Owen Moore was at her bedside. All stories and rumors of wild parties and cocaine and domestic fights since we left New York are untrue.|$|E

60|$|I did try, but {{something}} seemed to prevent me from accomplishing my purpose {{of giving the}} carving back to Zikali as I wished to do. First <b>my</b> pipe got <b>in</b> the way of my hand, then the elephant hairs caught in the collar of my coat; then a pang of rheumatism to which I was accustomed from an old lion-bite, developed of a sudden <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arm,</b> <b>and</b> lastly I grew tired of bothering about the thing.|$|R
60|$|I recoiled before {{contemplation of}} that frightful death, {{and for a}} moment I entertained the wild idea of seizing Maud <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> leaping overboard. Then I {{resolved}} to wait, and at the last moment, when we entered on the final stretch, to take her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> proclaim my love, and, with her in my embrace, to make the desperate struggle and die.|$|E
60|$|She turned away, half-laughing, half-crying; but I {{caught her}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> crushed her sweet lips against mine.|$|E

60|$|Now but for {{the respect}} in which I held her, I could have taken the pretty Duchesse <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> kissed her.|$|E
60|$|I took Margaret <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> kissed her. Her {{eyes were}} wet with tears. She clung {{to me and}} was near, I felt, to sobbing.|$|E

60|$|Oh! I won't {{say that}} she threw herself <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> then <b>and</b> there. No, no! She demurred. All young girls, it seems, demur under the circumstances; but she was adorable, coy and tender in turns, pouting and coaxing, and playing like a kitten till she had taken the papers from me and, with a woman's natural curiosity, had turned the English letters over and over, even though she could not read a word of them.|$|R

6000|$|Mother {{was waiting}} for us on the porch, tremulous with excitement, too eager to remain in doors, and as I took her <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> <b>and</b> kissed her, I said, [...] "Mother, I've brought your new daughter." ...|$|E
60|$|And then I {{went back}} and took Ajor <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms</b> <b>and</b> kissed the tears from her eyes and a smile to her lips while {{together}} we watched {{the last of the}} Americans disappear into the forest.|$|E
6000|$|... "As he said (I read it long {{afterward}} {{in one of}} his letters to her): 'To hold you <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>arms,</b> close, <b>and</b> yet not close.
