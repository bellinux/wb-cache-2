5|$|Blues harpist Cyril Davies ran the London Skiffle Club at the Roundhouse {{public house}} in London’s Soho, {{which served as}} {{a focal point for}} British skiffle acts. Like guitarist Alexis Korner, he had worked <b>for</b> <b>Chris</b> Barber, playing in the R segment Barber {{introduced}} to his show and as part of the supporting band for visiting US artists. They began to play together as a duo and in 1957, deciding their central interest was blues, they closed the skiffle club and reopened a month later as The London Blues and Barrelhouse Club. It acted as a venue for visiting artists and their own performances. The visit of Muddy Waters in 1958 had a major impact on the duo and on the nature of British R in general. Initially British audiences were shocked by Waters's amplified electric blues, but he was soon playing to ecstatic crowds and receiving rave reviews. Where British blues had often emulated Delta blues and country blues in the emerging British folk revival, Davies and Korner, who had supported Waters on tour, now began to play high-powered electric blues, forming the band Blues Incorporated.|$|E
