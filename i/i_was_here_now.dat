6000|$|... "I suppose I did," [...] she {{admitted}} with a smile. [...] "You know I helped {{you in a}} mysterious plot the last time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>here.</b> <b>Now</b> it would be selfish of me {{to ask you to}} wait if you think you'd better not." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forget and forgive," [...] {{she cried}} passionately. [...] "I loved {{you all the}} time, {{remember}} that, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here,</b> <b>now,</b> in your arms." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "John Briggs, John Briggs, if I did {{not mean}} you good, should <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>now?</b> Now do, like a {{reasonable}} man, {{tell me what you}} intend to do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, indeed, my man," [...] {{returned}} the merchant; [...] "but I {{have reason to}} be supremely thankful that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> in any condition of mind and body worthy of being recognised." ...|$|R

60|$|Grey horror seared his flesh. Folding {{the page}} {{into his pocket}} he turned into Eccles street, hurrying homeward. Cold oils slid along his veins, {{chilling}} his blood: age crusting him with a salt cloak. Well, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now.</b> Yes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now.</b> Morning mouth bad images. Got up {{wrong side of the}} bed. Must begin again those Sandow's exercises. On the hands down. Blotchy brown brick houses. Number eighty still unlet. Why is that? Valuation is only twenty-eight. Towers, Battersby, North, MacArthur: parlour windows plastered with bills. Plasters on a sore eye. To smell the gentle smoke of tea, fume of the pan, sizzling butter. Be near her ample bedwarmed flesh. Yes, yes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not without reason," [...] she {{retorted}} quickly. [...] "Did I not {{sit quietly}} by you after you had acted {{in that way}} towards me, {{waiting for you to}} speak--to explain, and you were silent? Well, se√±or, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now,</b> waiting again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know," [...] he interrupted; [...] "but {{why should}} <b>I</b> <b>be</b> solicitous for his life? That <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> <b>is</b> no thanks to him, {{and why should}} I give up mine {{for the sake of}} him who meant to make an end of me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{is none of}} your warriors, sir," [...] {{answered}} Bladud, [...] "but one of {{your guests}} who has, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> told, challenged whoever will to fight him for the hand of your fair daughter. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> to accept that challenge and to fight with Gunrig if he will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then for her sake," [...] Dominey {{suggested}} in a softer tone, [...] "can't you forget how thoroughly you disapprove of me? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> {{with only one}} object: I want you {{to point out to}} me any way in which we can work together for the improvement of my wife's health." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{had already}} written out Ruth's history," [...] Arnold said, his voice shaking a little. [...] "He had written {{it out in}} pencil {{on a couple of}} sheets of foolscap. He gave them to me to bring away with me. I read them coming up. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> to repeat their purport to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{all very}} well," [...] my literal mind continues, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>were</b> in Greenwich <b>I</b> might <b>be</b> in yesterday. Strange {{things happen in}} Greenwich. But I know as sure as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> living that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here,</b> <b>now,</b> in to-day, June 7, and that I took the sun <b>here,</b> <b>now,</b> to-day, June 7. Therefore, I must correct the sun <b>here,</b> <b>now,</b> to-day, June 7." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} be accused in that way without {{defending}} myself. Let it be fancy or what not, I love Marion Fay, and I have come here to tell her so. If I can make any impression on her I shall come again and tell her father so. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> because <b>I</b> {{think that you can}} help me. If you will not, I shall go on without your help." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Courage, Philip," [...] she murmured. [...] "Remember {{that what}} you did ... well, {{in a way it}} was for my sake, wasn't it?--for love of me? <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> and we <b>are</b> both free. The old days are passed. Even their shadow cannot trouble us any longer. Don't be a sentimentalist. Listen and I'll tell you something--at {{the bottom of my heart}} I rather admire you for what you did. Don't you want your reward?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You like misery, I think, Mr. Dishart," [...] McQueen {{said when}} Gavin came to him, [...] "at least <b>I</b> <b>am</b> always finding {{you in the}} thick of it, and that <b>is</b> why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now.</b> <b>I</b> have a rare job for you if you will jump into the machine. You know Nanny Webster, who lives on the edge of Windyghoul? No, you don't, for she belongs to the other kirk. Well, at all events, you knew her brother, Sanders, the mole-catcher?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, candidly,' said Miss Sinnett severely. 'I {{was very}} much scandalised; and <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> telling you my story if it hadn't been for your mother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|She was silent; and not {{wishing to}} dwell on a subject that seemed to pain her, I continued: [...] "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now,</b> but you will not stay with me and talk freely! Will it always be the same if I remain with you? Why are you always so silent in the house, so cold with your old grandfather? So different--so full of life, like a bird, when you are alone in the woods? Rima, speak to me! Am I no more to you than your old grandfather? Do you not like {{me to talk to}} you?" ...|$|R
500|$|Kemp was a {{voracious}} reader, and {{his political}} beliefs were founded in early readings of Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, Ayn Rand's libertarian novels, such as The Fountainhead, and Friedrich von Hayek's The Constitution of Liberty. He also brought from his football career a belief in racial equality, which came from playing football with black teammates: Kemp said, [...] "I wasn't there with Rosa Parks or Dr. King or John Lewis. But <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> going to yell from the rooftops about {{what we need to}} do." [...] Kemp's football colleagues confirmed this influence: John Mackey explained that [...] "the huddle is colorblind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh do {{come in and}} {{sit down}} a minute, Susan, please,' said Polly. 'This is my sister Jemima, this <b>is.</b> Jemima, <b>I</b> don't know what I should ever do with myself, if it wasn't for Susan Nipper; <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> but for her.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pshaw!" [...] {{returned}} Harding. [...] "We all {{get into}} scrapes. <b>I</b> wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> if other people hadn't dragged me clear of a mower-knife, and once {{out of the}} way of a locomotive when my team balked in the middle of the track." ...|$|R
5000|$|Mrs Perkins: (referring to Mr Meaker) <b>I</b> wish he <b>was</b> <b>here</b> <b>now.</b> For two pins, Id {{tell him}} what I think of him! ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{drew back}} still farther. [...] "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "or <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>now.</b> There! that must suffice you. And {{if you wish}} me still to believe you, you will not speak of this again while we are out together. Come, let us {{go back to the}} horses." ...|$|R
40|$|Thanks to God for {{the blessing}} to {{finishing}} this master thesis project {{which is about}} an FDM Prototype for Pathway and Protein Interaction data. I {{would like to say}} my deepest gratitude and thank you to: 1. Graham Kemp, as lecturer, supervisor and colleague for this project for the time, talks, discussions, help and advice during the courses and master project.

6000|$|... 'I am wasting time, {{and there}} is none to spare; yet if I hadn't thought of all, <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>now.</b> Wretchedness and ruin came on me, <b>I</b> say. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> made a {{short-lived}} toy, and flung aside more cruelly and carelessly than even such things are. By whose hand do you think?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a pity," [...] I went on, {{following}} up what I thought a fortunate lead, [...] "that we city people see {{so little of}} the farming life when we come into the country. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> for several seasons, {{and this is the}} first time <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> inside a farmer's house." ...|$|R
60|$|June 2.--This is {{the fourth}} day of a dark {{northeast}} storm, wind and rain. Day before yesterday <b>was</b> my birthday. <b>I</b> have now enter'd on my 60th year. Every day of the storm, protected by overshoes and a waterproof blanket, I regularly {{come down to the}} pond, and ensconce myself under the lee of the great oak; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> writing these lines. The dark smoke-color'd clouds roll in furious silence athwart the sky; the soft green leaves dangle all around me; the wind steadily keeps up its hoarse, soothing music over my head--Nature's mighty whisper. Seated here in solitude <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> musing over my life--connecting events, dates, as links of a chain, neither sadly nor cheerily, but somehow, to-day here under the oak, in the rain, in an unusually matter-of-fact spirit.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is there {{anything}} else that I can tell you? I may say that I have, personally, no influence whatever at court. I have never failed to express myself strongly, {{in reference to the}} policy of persecution; and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only <b>here,</b> <b>now,</b> in obedience to the royal orders to present myself at court." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS. MEGAN. I dunno. [She shivers.] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> standin' <b>here</b> just <b>now</b> {{when you}} was talkin', and when I heard 'im, it cam' over {{me to do}} it--like.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I {{have wanted}} to put a bullet into that knot from the trees back there ever since <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>here,</b> and <b>now</b> let's see if I struck it fairly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps {{that would}} be best, father. Indeed I don't know what I should do if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to stop <b>here</b> <b>now</b> {{with nothing to do}} but to worry about him." ...|$|R
60|$|CHARLES. Yes, faith, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> so <b>now.</b> <b>Here,</b> my honest Rowley, here, get me {{this changed}} directly, {{and take a}} hundred pounds of it {{immediately}} to old Stanley.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{considered}} you, Lute," [...] he began doggedly. [...] "I did consider {{you at the}} very first. I should never have gone on with it. I should have gone away. I knew it. And I considered you {{in the light of}} that knowledge, and yet... I did not go away. My God! what <b>was</b> <b>I</b> to do? I loved you. I could not go away. I could not help it. I stayed. I resolved, but I broke my resolves. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> like a drunkard. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> drunk of you. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> weak, <b>I</b> know. I failed. I could not go away. I tried. I went away--you will remember, though you did not know why. You know now. I went away, but I could not remain away. Knowing that we could never marry, I came back to you. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here,</b> <b>now,</b> with you. Send me away, Lute. I have not the strength to go myself." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then, smiling sweetly, [...] "Dear boy," [...] said he, [...] "were I such as you fancy, {{how should}} <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>here</b> <b>now,</b> discoursing with you {{concerning}} truth, instead of conning my speech for the Pnyx, like Alcibiades, that I {{may become a}} demagogue, deceiving the mob with flattery, and win for myself houses, and lands, and gold, and slave-girls, and fame, and power, even to a tyranny itself? For in this way I might have made my tongue a profitable member of my body; but now, being hurried {{up and down in}} barren places, like one mad of love, from my longing after fair youths, I waste my speech on them; receiving, as is the wont of true lovers, only curses and ingratitude from their arrogance. But tell me, thou proud Adonis-This spirit of truth in thee, which thou thoughtest, and rightly, thy most noble possession- did it desire truth, or not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the same}} reason that in summer you never see Snowflake and Wanderer the Horned Lark and some others I might name," [...] replied Snipper. [...] "Give me the Far North every time. I would stay there the year through but that {{sometimes}} food gets scarce up there. That <b>is</b> why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> down <b>here</b> <b>now.</b> If you'll excuse me, I'll go finish my breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>are</b> right, Nana. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> sent <b>here</b> to ascertain, if possible, what {{is going}} on, and how things are likely to tend. But first, I {{must tell you that}} <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>now</b> <b>here</b> as Colonel Palmer's assistant." ...|$|R
6000|$|WILLIS: 'Well, Aunt Mary, <b>I</b> wish Agnes <b>were</b> <b>here</b> <b>now</b> to see Roberts in his {{character}} of MORAL hero. He 'done' {{it with his}} little hatchet, but he waited {{to make sure that}} Bushrod was all right before he owned up.' ...|$|R
