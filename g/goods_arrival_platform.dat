50|$|The {{platform}} accommodation in {{the station}} was modest, having an <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and a departure platform, with two sidings between them. The siding adjacent to the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> was equipped with ground frame points to release an arriving train engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{airport is}} served by Line E of the Porto Metro. The station has three {{platforms}} and the trains leave the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and reverse {{into one of the}} departure platforms.|$|R
60|$|In the meantime, Springrove was pacing up {{and down}} the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> of the railway-station. Half-past eight o'clock--the time at which Owen's train was due--had come, and passed, but no train appeared.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: The bus {{platforms}} at {{the rear}} of the main terminal, as seen from above. Departure platforms are housed in the structure in the middle, while the structure in the distant right houses the <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Note: Since {{this station}} is the {{terminus}} {{of the branch}} line, one platform is designated as the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and the other as the departure platform. However, in actual service only one platform is used at any given time.|$|R

25|$|As Piccadilly was {{originally}} a terminus of the system, one platform {{was originally}} used for arrivals from Altrincham, Bury, and later Eccles, {{and the other}} platform was used for departures. Empty trams ran from the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> into a reversing siding in a tunnel, where they would reverse and then enter the departure platform. The stop was built with extension in mind, and since {{the opening of the}} extension towards Ashton in 2013, the former <b>arrivals</b> <b>platform</b> is also used for departures towards Ashton as well as terminating trams, while the former departures platform now also handles arrivals from Ashton. Terminating trams use a reversing siding on the Ashton line between Piccadilly and New Islington tram stops.|$|R
50|$|The {{double-sided}} and symmetrically arranged station building {{consisted of}} two protruding wings and a recessed central section. The neo-classical single-storey building included two 96 metres-long train sheds with arched arcades, one covering the <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms</b> and the other the departure platforms. Two other tracks ran between the train sheds that were designed for the movement of rolling stock. The two station buildings differed only with regard to a few functionally-related trifles. The departure platforms could only be accessed through an entrance hall, which contained a ticket office, baggage acceptance facilities and restaurants. In contrast, the <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms</b> were freely accessible and bigger to cope better with the surge of traffic when trains arrived.|$|R
6000|$|... "The next witness, Constable Thomas Taylor, {{had noticed}} a shabbily dressed individual, with shaggy hair and beard, loafing about {{the station and}} waiting-rooms in the {{afternoon}} of December the 10th. He seemed to be watching the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> of the Tilbury and Southend trains.|$|R
25|$|When {{steam and}} diesel trains run together, it is normal for the diesel to lead up the mountain. This allows the steam train {{to enter the}} {{departure}} platform and load at its leisure, while the diesel moves across from the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> from a quick turn-around.|$|R
6000|$|The crowd melted away, {{after the}} bustling fashion common to <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms,</b> and I was {{beginning}} to feel uneasy, lest I might miss my guest, when a sweet-faced, dainty looking girl stepped up to me, and after a quick glance said, [...] "Dr. Seward, is it not?" ...|$|R
50|$|The {{station on}} the Sakaisuji Line is located under the station on Nankai Railway, and was {{constructed}} together with the elevation of the Nankai Railway lines. An island platform serving 2 tracks and a side platform serving a track are located on the first basement. The side platform (1 train departs every day) is used as the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> in the rush hours.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} a large {{building}} facing Paradise Road near the junction with Kings Road. A tall tower {{was part of the}} main building which stood on the departure platform. The departure and <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms</b> and two sidings between were covered by two substantial train sheds with wide glazed arches at the end. The goods yard was situated to the south of the passenger station.|$|R
50|$|The main {{building}} {{is on the}} south side of the line, nearest the town centre and facing the bus station; it dates from 2000. It contains a booking office and shop. This is Platform 1 and is used by trains running from east to west so is the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> for services from London Paddington and Plymouth and departure platform for Truro and Penzance.|$|R
25|$|The diesel {{locomotives}} are {{used on the}} normal trains, with the steam locomotives being used on higher priced Heritage Steam trains. On arrival at Llanberis, diesel-hauled trains run directly from the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> to the departure platform, load and depart at the scheduled time. Steam-hauled trains take at least {{half an hour to}} transfer from the arrival to the departure platform, thus making no more than one trip every three hours.|$|R
500|$|The {{main station}} between Bishop's Bridge Road and Praed Street was {{designed}} by Brunel, who was enthusiastic {{at the idea of}} being able to design a railway station himself, although much of the architectural detailing was by his associate Matthew Digby Wyatt. [...] He took inspiration from Joseph Paxton's Crystal Palace and the München Hauptbahnhof. The glazed roof is supported by wrought iron arches in three spans, respectively spanning , [...] and [...] The roof is [...] long, and the original roof spans had two transepts connecting the three spans. It is commonly believed that these were provided by Brunel to accommodate traversers to carry coaches between the tracks within the station. However recent research, using early documents and photographs, does not seem to support this belief, and their actual purpose is unknown. The original station used four platforms, a -wide and -wide departure platform, [...] a [...] <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> and a [...] combined <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and cab road. A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.|$|R

A series of nineteen turnplates were sited beyond the ends of the platforms for horse and coach traffic.|$|R
50|$|The station {{consists}} of two elevated side platforms serving a track each. When the station opened, Platform 1 was rarely used while Platform 2 was used for trains bound for Amagasaki. Between 1965 and 1974 when Nishi-Osaka limited express trains were operated, Platform 1 was used for these trains. Until {{the opening of the}} Hanshin Namba Line in 2009, the track (platform) was used as the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> from January 23 until February 23.|$|R
5000|$|Behind {{the main}} {{entrance}} building, the L&B station had a wrought iron framed trainshed which had two spans, and covered an area 217 feet (66 metres) long and 113 feet (34 metres) wide. It had two platforms, one for departures and one for arrivals. The Grand Junction Railway had parallel departure and <b>arrivals</b> <b>platforms</b> and a separate entrance building and booking office (now demolished) further along Curzon Street, designed by Joseph Franklin.|$|R
5000|$|The Glasgow Queen Street {{station was}} very cramped, and {{included}} a goods station. More branch services were terminating at the station, and in 1877 the North British Railway {{opened up the}} mouth of the tunnel and widened the station throat, and provided six platforms. (It had been built with a single <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and a single departure platform, with three carriage stabling sidings between, and a goods station on the east side next to North Hanover Street.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Both of the camp's most {{well-known}} commanders, Richard Baer and Rudolf Höss, are {{visible in the}} photographs. But possibly the most notorious Auschwitz figure who features in the album is Dr. Josef Mengele, known to camp prisoners as the [...] "Angel of Death." [...] Mengele, a trained physician, directed the medical experiments on twin children in the camp. He regularly {{took part in the}} [...] "selection" [...] on the train <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> judging which prisoners would be immediately executed and which would be permitted to live and perform slave labor.|$|R
50|$|The {{station has}} four storeys above ground level. The ground floor has a taxi stand outside and {{has access to}} the {{concourse}} on the first floor. The concourse is integrated with the Maritime Square shopping centre. The second floor houses the Tung Chung line platform for trains heading for Hong Kong Station, and the third floor houses the Tung Chung line platform for services towards Tung Chung Station. At the Airport Express departure and <b>arrival</b> <b>platforms,</b> there is a free WiFi hotspot available. Unlike at Kowloon and Hong Kong stations, there are no in-town check-in facilities in this station.|$|R

2500|$|On 11 October 2009 the bogie of a DEMU (vehicle 60118), on [...] "The Eton Rifles" [...] tour, derailed on <b>arrival</b> at <b>platform</b> 1. The tour {{could not}} {{continue}} and passengers were sent {{out on the}} next timetabled train.|$|R
50|$|The Points Box {{remained}} in use until {{the summer of}} 1970 when the point work of the Port Erin <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and its associated signals were disconnected. These points were then controlled with hand levers and the signals were placed permanently in the 'off' position so that trains could arrive and depart without the box being manned, saving the associated wage costs. Thereafter, it was used only for more complicated shunting movements in which case it would be manned {{by a member of}} the train crew or the stationmaster. The remainder was taken out of use in 1979/80 when the old Port Erin Platforms - 5 & 6 - were removed and the area cleared for parking.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} {{designed}} by Jean-Louis Beaulieu, who also provided sculptural grilles for the station's main staircase and {{the rear of the}} control building. The station's main artwork, a group of four murals by Claude Guité running the full length of the platform and entitled Les quatre saisons (the four seasons). The murals are painted on 500 panels of asbestos cement stretching {{the entire length of the}} platforms, they portray semi-abstract scenes of the foliage and weather associated with each of the four seasons. The seasons go in order, counterclockwise around the platforms, with winter on the Côte-Vertu platform, spring on Montmorency, summer on the Saint-Michel departure platform, and autumn on the Snowdon <b>arrival</b> <b>platform.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Porte d'Orléans (Général Leclerc) is {{a station}} of line 4 of the Paris Métro and {{a stop on}} tramway line 3a. It is {{situated}} in the 14th Arrondissement, in the quartier of Petit-Montrouge. The station is the former southern terminus of line 4. A terminal loop was provided at the station for trains to turn around to return north towards Porte de Clignancourt. Passengers used to disembark at the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and then the train proceeded empty via the loop to the departure platform.The extension to Mairie de Montrouge modified {{the layout of the}} station, the northbound platform was extended toward the track coming from the former terminal loop to add a new entrance.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then a {{gigantic}} sigh of expectancy came from {{every one of}} the spectators. The 'fun' was about to begin. James Buckland, a porter at Fenchurch Street railway station, had just sworn to tell all the truth, etc. After all, it did not amount to much. He said that at six o'clock in the afternoon of December the 10th, in the midst of one of the densest fogs he ever remembers, the 5.5 from Tilbury steamed into the station, being just about an hour late. He was on the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> and was hailed by a passenger in a first-class carriage. He could see very little of him beyond an enormous black fur coat and a travelling cap of fur also.|$|R
5000|$|The {{station was}} opened on 21 April 1908 {{as part of}} the first section of the line from Châtelet. A {{terminal}} loop is provided at the station for trains to turn around to return south towards Montrouge. Passengers usually detrain at the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> and then the train proceeds empty via the loop to the departure platform. Beyond the turning loop lie a series of storage sidings and the main depot for Line 4 in Saint-Ouen. Clignancourt was an ancient hamlet that belonged to the abbey of Saint-Denis, and was annexed to Paris in 1860. The term [...] "porte" [...] refers to a gate of the Thiers Wall built to defend Paris between 1841 and 1844 and demolished in the 1920s.|$|R
5000|$|The {{line was}} double track from the start; the station at Bath {{had a large}} all-over roof, {{covering}} two platforms in the then-traditional format of a departure <b>platform</b> and an <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> with two carriage sidings between them. (In later years the platforms were used for both arrivals and departures, {{and one of the}} carriage sidings was altered to become an engine-release road.) The station at Bath was called simply [...] "Bath" [...] although timetables sometimes indicated [...] "Queen Square -- about 1 mile to G.W. station". It seems that the description Queen Square was never formally used by the railway. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948, it was no longer appropriate to refer to [...] "Midland station" [...] and the title Bath Green Park was applied from 18 June 1951.|$|R
2500|$|The inaugural run of {{the first}} four cars was on 14 May 2007, being met by the Minister of Transport, Annette King, on <b>arrival</b> on <b>Platform</b> 9 at Wellington at 9.20am.

25|$|At {{the three}} Reinhard camps {{the victims were}} killed by the exhaust fumes of {{stationary}} diesel engines. Gold fillings were pulled from the corpses before burial, but the women's hair was cut before death. At Treblinka, in order to calm the arriving victims, the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> was made to look like a train station, complete with fake clock. Majdanek used Zyklon-B gas in its gas chambers. In contrast to Auschwitz, the three Reinhard camps were quite small. At these camps, most of the initial victims were buried in pits, but in 1942 in order to hide the evidence of the extermination, the exhumation of the bodies and cremation of them was begun. Sobibór and Bełżec began the process in late 1942 but Treblinka did not start until March 1943. The bodies were burned in open fireplaces and the remaining bones were crushed into powder.|$|R
5|$|The mass {{deportation}} of Jews {{from the}} Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 {{with the first}} shipment of 6,000 people. The gas chambers started operation the following morning. For the next two months, deportations from Warsaw continued {{on a daily basis}} via two shuttle trains (the second one, from 6 August 1942), each carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people crying for water. No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the Sonderkommando squad that managed the <b>arrival</b> <b>platform,</b> and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS Brigadeführer Jürgen Stroop, 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during the period from 22 July to 12 September 1942.|$|R
5000|$|These were four-wheeled {{brake and}} luggage vans fitted with lookout duckets, but {{otherwise}} entirely sealed {{with only two}} drop-sash windows at the guard's door. None of these vans survive today, and they were effectively made redundant when later passenger coaches had their own braking systems. The {{primary purpose of the}} [...] "E" [...] van was to provide luggage accommodation and braking for the original [...] "A" [...] - [...] "D" [...] class most of which did not have their own brakes when supplied in 1873/4. One surviving member of the class sat {{at the end of the}} Port Erin <b>arrival</b> <b>platform</b> at Douglas for many years and retained its pre-war two-tone brown livery. The Manx Northern Railway owned a pair of similar vans for use with the [...] "N" [...] class carriages, but these seem to have been replaced in the 1890s and then used for goods traffic until they were scrapped in the 1920s. [...] The possibility of the Isle of Man Steam Railway Supporters' Association recreating one of these vehicles has been mooted in the past but never reached fruition.|$|R
50|$|Network Rail has proposed, {{in their}} North West RUS, {{installing}} a facing cross-over {{which will allow}} platform 1 to become fully operational as an <b>arrival</b> and departure <b>platform.</b> Doing this will {{reduce the number of}} shunt moves.|$|R
25|$|There {{are three}} platforms- Platforms 1 and 2 can be (and are) used for any {{combination}} of <b>arrival</b> or departure. <b>Platform</b> 3 cannot be used for arrivals from the West Coastway or departures towards London in the up direction.|$|R
