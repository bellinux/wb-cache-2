Critical response to Eve was mixed; some praised its inclusion as a part of UPN's line-up of black sitcoms, but others felt Eve lacked charisma, and that the series was inferior to other black sitcoms. Despite the negative reception, the show and Eve received several award nominations. The series was released on the iTunes Store and Amazon Video.|$|E

This innovation was originally suggested by Superintendent of Finance Robert Morris, with whom Hamilton corresponded after examining one of Morris's Nova Constellatio coins in 1783. He also desired the minting of small value coins, such as silver ten-cent and copper cent and half-cent pieces, <b>for</b> <b>reducing</b> {{the cost of living}} for the poor.

This was followed in early 1961 by an Alaska Sportsmen's Council resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers <b>for</b> <b>reducing</b> its funding for studies {{of the impact of}} the project on fish and game stocks.
