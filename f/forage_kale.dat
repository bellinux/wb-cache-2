40|$|Turnip tops or greens, {{the early}} leaves of {{rutabaga}} (Brassica napus var. rapifera L.), are a traditional Newfoundland vegetable. Commercial farmers currently grow and market forage rape (B. napus L.) as greens. Our objectives were to determine why forage rape is now grown in preference to other Brassica crops {{and to examine}} potential greens alternatives. Seed from two cultivars each of three Brassicas [rutabaga, forage rape and <b>forage</b> <b>kale</b> (Brassica oleracea var. medullosa L.) ] was used in: 1) a germination study at 5, 10, 15 and 20 °C; 2) a growth study at constant temperature regimes of 12 and 18 °C; 3) a 2 yr agronomic study; and 4) a sensory evaluation for appearance and taste as a boiled vegetable. Hobson rape, Dwarf Essex rape and the locally bred Brookfield rutabaga germinated, emerged and grew faster than both kale cultivars and Laurentian rutabaga at all controlled-temperature regimes. The two kale cultivars and Laurentian rutabaga did not exhibit adequate agronomic potential. Although the rape cultivars were among the top-yielding entries at most harvests, Brookfield rutabaga yielded greater leaf weight in both years of the agronomic study. Judges preferred the visual appearance of greens with dark green leaves, a characteristic of the forage rape cultivars studied, but favored the taste of boiled kale...|$|E
40|$|Intensive grazing of {{forage crops}} by dairy cows is common {{practice}} {{during the winter}} months in the Canterbury region of New Zealand. Such intensive grazing on wet soil increases the risk of denitrification and the production of the powerful greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N₂O). However, {{at the beginning of this}} research project, no information was available on denitrification and N₂O emission from forage crops grown in free-draining stony soils, which are widespread in Canterbury. The objectives of this thesis were, therefore, to quantify N₂O emissions from winter grazed forage soil, develop methods to mitigate those emissions, and to improve knowledge and understanding of the effects of severe animal trampling on the physical properties of, and denitrifying microbial population in, the soil below forage crops grazed by dairy cows during winter. Three field-based experiments were carried out in 2011, 2012 and 2013, and were complimented by a laboratory-based experiment in 2012. The field experiments used lysimeters and soil blocks collected from a stony Balmoral soil used for <b>forage</b> <b>kale.</b> The nitrification inhibitor, dicyandiamide (DCD), and a carbon-rich biochar were also used as soil amendments to mitigate N₂O emissions. Total N₂O emissions from trampled soil ranged from 1. 3 % to 1. 9 % of urine-N applied to the soil. When applied at 20 kg ha⁻¹, DCD reduced total N₂O emissions from trampled soil with urine by 44 - 68 %, but DCD did not significantly affect N₂O emissions from non-trampled soil. Biochar, with or without DCD, had no significant effect on N₂O emissions when incorporated into the soil at 5 t ha⁻¹ (1 % of soil dry weight). Trampling increased the bulk density of the fine earth fraction of the stony soil from 0. 89 g cm³ to 1. 11 g cm³ (P< 0. 05) in year two, and from 1. 03 g cm³ to 1. 19 g cm³ (P< 0. 05) in year three. Trampling decreased the air permeability of the stony soil by more than one order of magnitude (P< 0. 01). When sampled, the volumetric water content of the trampled soil was, on average, higher than that of the non-trampled soil (P< 0. 05), which combined with the reduction in air permeability to create anaerobic conditions suitable for the growth of denitrifying microbes. Significant increases in the abundance of NO₂⁻ reducing nirS gene copies were observed in trampled soil that had been treated with urine (under both laboratory and field conditions). Similarly, in the field, significantly more N₂O reducing nosZ clade-I (P< 0. 05) and nosZ clade-II (P< 0. 01) gene copies were found in trampled soil than non-trampled soil. The increase in nosZ gene copies in urine amended trampled soil was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of ¹⁵N labelled urine emitted as N₂ gas – the final product of denitrification (P< 0. 05). The increase in denitrifying gene copies and corresponding increase in urine-derived N₂ gas following trampling is an important finding, as at the time of writing, no authors had described such a relationship. This work has shown that denitrification does occur in free draining stony soil when forage crops are intensively grazed by dairy cows during winter, and is an important N-loss pathway that should not be overlooked...|$|E
40|$|Forage {{harvesting}} {{and conservation}} must be properly managed {{in order to}} guarantee the quality of feed fed to the herd, keeping harvesting costs under control and ensuring {{the safety of the}} livestock farming system. In France, forage stores range between 1. 2 and 3. 5 kg DM/LU and vary according to the length of the growing season, herd size, and animal requirements. Optimizing forage stores implies managing grazing land and meadow land, matching herd requirements and available grazing land (including Winter grazing), making the most of the physiological adaptability of animal groups and growing <b>forage</b> crops (maize, <b>kale,</b> beet [...] .). Whether providing for bovine or ovine livestock (milk herds and meat herds), a number of options are available, but these must be planned on a farm scale...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{investigated the}} physical and economic impact of incorporating tactical responses in risk management strategies in high performance dryland sheep production systems. An existing grazing sheep simulation model {{was used in the}} study. The model was extended by incorporating additional pasture, animal and management modules required in line with the objectives. Seven strategies (S) which differed in the pasture mixes utilised (either grass- or legume-based) and stock class utilised as flexibility options (cattle; grass-based system or old ewes; legume-based system), were evaluated at different stocking rates (SR; stock units (SU) per ha (SU ha 1)), with and without tactical adjustments to trigger soil moisture level (SML) in the top 25 cm soil. Strategy 1 simulated a conventional sheep farm with 13 paddocks of perennial grass:clover mix, 2 paddocks in <b>forage</b> crop (<b>kale)</b> and one paddock into lucerne; strategy 2 was similar to 1 but with 25. 0 % of the ewes replaced with equivalent cattle stock units; strategy 3 was similar 1 but with introduction of a 1 st cycle ewe policy; strategy 4 was a combination of strategies 2 and 3; strategy 5 was similar to 3 but with introduction of 2 paddocks of switch pasture and 3 of lucerne; strategy 6 was similar to 4 but with introduction of 2 paddocks of switch pasture and 3 of lucerne; and strategy 7 was similar to 5 but with 5 paddocks of switch pasture and 4 of lucerne. Initially, each of the seven strategies was run at 10, 12, 14 and 16 SR resulting in a 2 factors (7 S x 4 SR) experiment but without incorporation of tactical adjustments to drop in target SML. In the subsequent analysis, each strategy was re-run with tactical adjustments to the SML target set at 10. 0, 12. 5 or 15. 0 % resulting in a 3 factors (7 S x 4 SR x 3 SML) experiment. In general, lambing percentage was consistently higher in strategy 5 for all the SR considered when the opportunities of incorporating tactical responses in risk management strategies were ignored. However, following inclusion of tactical adjustments to climatic variability, the lambing percentage averaged 137. 07 % across all strategies and SR. Strategy 4 resulted in the highest meat yield and gross margin (GM) but trailed in wool yield. Results obtained in this study show that coefficients of variability (CV) for lambing percentage increased with increase in SR translating to increased risk with increase in SR in high performance dryland sheep systems. All strategies incorporating tactical responses were economically superior to those which did not. In some instances, the difference in GM between corresponding strategies with and without including tactical adjustment to climatic variability was as high as 39. 65 %. In all cases, corresponding risk management strategies incorporating tactical responses to climatic variability resulted in higher GM (P < 0. 05) and lower risk (P < 0. 05). The extra income derived from including tactical responses can be viewed as the cost to the farmer of basing choice regarding a management strategy on analysis that neglects the tactical advantages afforded by such a strategy...|$|R
40|$|Dairy winter forage grazing is {{a common}} {{practice}} within the Canterbury region of New Zealand. However, until recently {{there was a lack}} of knowledge about the concentration and amount of nitrate-N (NO₃⁻-N) leached from dairy winter forage grazing systems. In addition, {{there was a lack of}} knowledge around what ammonia oxidising microbes mediated the nitrification process in intensively grazed winter forage systems where the soils are usually wet, cold, and anaerobic. Furthermore, it was not known whether the nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) or biochar could be successful mitigation tools in reducing nitrate (NO₃⁻-N) leaching from these systems. Thus the objectives of this research were to: 1) quantify the concentration and the amount of NO₃⁻-N leached from cow urine patches deposited during dairy winter forage grazing; 2) quantify the effects of trampling on NO 3 - leaching losses under dairy winter forage grazing conditions; 3) improve knowledge and understanding of the effectiveness of the mitigation tools DCD and biochar, to reduce NO₃⁻-N leaching losses under dairy winter forage grazing conditions; and 4) improve knowledge and understanding on the effect of cow urine, animal trampling, DCD, and biochar, on the abundance and activity of AOB and AOA under dairy winter forage grazing conditions. Two lysimeter trials were carried out using a Balmoral stony silt loam under a <b>kale</b> <b>forage</b> crop to cover these objectives by measuring the NO₃⁻-N leaching losses, the effect of soil trampling, and the use of DCD and biochar as mitigation tools. Companion plots were used to measure the soil nitrification rates and ammonia oxidising community abundance and activity under dairy winter forage grazing conditions. The first trial had a urine application rate of 700 kg N ha- 1. However, the second trial had a lower urine application rate of 400 kg N ha- 1 due to recent research identifying a lower urine-N concentration from kale-fed dairy cows. Both lysimeter trials identified that the dominant source of NO₃⁻ leaching loss was from the cow urine. The lower application rate of urine (400 kg N ha- 1) had significantly lower NO₃⁻-N leaching losses compared to urine applied at 700 kg N ha- 1. In addition, the first lysimeter trial identified that DCD reduced NO₃⁻-N leaching losses by 38 % and DCD combined with biochar resulted in a reduction of 46 %. However, biochar alone did not significantly reduce NO₃⁻-N leaching losses. The second lysimeter trial found that trampling the soil reduced NO₃⁻-N leaching losses by 34 % (urine only). DCD reduced NO₃⁻-N leaching losses by 61 % when soil was trampled and by 40 % when un-trampled. Both companion soil plots showed that ammonia oxidiser communities were affected by the application of urine: the AOB amoA gene abundance and AOB amoA transcript abundance significantly increased, whereas AOA growth was inhibited. A companion incubation study was carried out to determine the effect of urine application rates, DCD application rates, and biochar presence on nitrification, ammonia oxidising community abundance and activity under simulated dairy winter forage grazing conditions. The application of urine increased soil nitrification rates. However, there was no difference between the two urine application rates. DCD reduced the soil NO₃⁻-N concentration by 86 - 91 %. The application rate of 20 kg DCD ha- 1 had a significantly lower soil NO₃⁻-N concentration compared to the application rate of 10 kg DCD ha- 1. DCD combined with biochar reduced the soil NO₃⁻-N concentration by 86 %. However, biochar alone did not affect the soil NO₃⁻-N concentration. The AOB amoA gene abundance and AOB amoA transcript abundance significantly increased with the application of urine, whereas the AOA growth was suppressed...|$|R
