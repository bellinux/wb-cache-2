500|$|Due to his immense {{popularity}} {{during his}} lifetime, Holmes was {{often called upon}} to produce commemorative poetry for specific occasions, including memorials, anniversaries and birthdays. Referring to this demand for his attention, he once wrote that he was [...] "a florist in verse, and what would people say / If <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> banquet without my bouquet?" [...] As critic Hyatt Waggoner noted, however, [...] "very little... survives the occasions that produced it". Holmes became known as a poet who expressed the benefits of loyalty and trust at serious gatherings, as well as one who showed wit at festivities and celebrations. Edwin Percy Whipple for one considered Holmes to be [...] "a poet of sentiment and passion. Those who know him only as a comic lyricist, as the libellous laureate of chirping follow and presumptuous egotism, would be surprised at the clear sweetness and skylark thrill of his serious and sentimental compositions".|$|E
2500|$|After I {{had been}} {{studying}} with him for two years, Schoenberg said, [...] "In order to write music, {{you must have a}} feeling for harmony." [...] I explained to him that I had no feeling for harmony. He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wall through which I could not pass. I said, 'In that case I will devote my life to beating my head against that wall.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|After the First World War {{the term}} [...] "Baltic States" [...] came {{to refer to}} {{countries}} by the Baltic sea that had gained independence from Russia in its aftermath. As such it included not only former Baltic governorates, but also Latgale, Lithuania and Finland. As World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> close, [...] Lithuania declared independence and Latvia formed a provisional government. Estonia had already obtained autonomy from tsarist Russia in 1917, but was subsequently occupied by the German Empire; they fought an independence war against Soviet Russia and Baltic nobility before gaining true independence from 1920 to 1939. Latvia and Lithuanians followed a similar process, until the Latvian War of Independence and Lithuanian Wars of Independence were extinguished in 1920.|$|E
50|$|He was {{in office}} when World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end.|$|R
50|$|Džanić {{was born}} into a well-to-do Bosniak family in the Bosnian city Bihać in 1918, around the time World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end.|$|R
6000|$|But now <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> scene {{different}} from all that had happened before, either to them or me; and {{the origin of the}} story was this: ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> crisis {{after that}} wild dinner of Tarvrille's. Something in that {{stripped}} my soul bare.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sitting posture in an instant, with my kidneys in {{my throat}} and my hair on end.|$|E
60|$|I dashed in {{the first}} door <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to.</b> <b>A</b> lady, {{partially}} clothed, stood there pale as death, and motionless.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've enlisted for the war, {{and shall}} not rest till either it or <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end. As for my reward, I had it when Belle kissed me." ...|$|R
60|$|Then as I {{strained}} to trace our later movements {{down to our}} present plight, the pain in my head became intolerable. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> insurmountable barrier, an obstinate blank.|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got mine," [...] said Mr. George. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{railway station}} <b>I</b> always get my ticket the first thing, {{and look at}} the pretty little dogs afterwards." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> full stop; having {{something}} yet to say, but {{not knowing how}} to express myself with the necessary delicacy.|$|E
60|$|I was {{not quite}} sure which way this last example pointed. It alarmed me when I thought of Lucilla. <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{standstill}} again.|$|E
60|$|Before noon <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> large, {{thatched}} house, with {{clumps of}} shady trees growing near it, also surrounded with brushwood fences and sheep and cattle enclosures.|$|E
6000|$|... "My young friend," [...] he said, [...] "it is {{not many}} hours since you and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{understanding}} of a sort. I am here <b>to</b> add <b>a</b> few words <b>to</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wait a minute," [...] she answered. [...] "Before I {{consented to}} answer the child's inquiries, <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{understanding}} with her mother. I said, 'Will you let Kitty see her father again?'" ...|$|R
60|$|And now, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> very {{important}} passage in Oliver's history; for I have <b>to</b> record <b>an</b> act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but which indirectly produced a material change {{in all his}} future prospects and proceedings.|$|R
60|$|At length <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Christ-cross stone Which she {{had passed}} without discern; And I knelt upon the leaves there strown, And prayed aloud {{that she might}} turn.|$|E
60|$|Presently <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wharf {{that seemed}} to be more public, and walked out to one side of it. Here it was shady, and close at hand floated a large row-boat.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt {{in front}} of him and looked into his sullen blue eyes. He had a certain odd haughtiness on his brows. But his blue eyes stared insolently at me.|$|E
6000|$|Now <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> {{sentence}} in the admiral's report which he dropped carelessly from his pen, no doubt, and never gave the matter a second thought. He little imagined what a freight of tragic prophecy it bore! This is the sentence:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'So I do,' said Mr. Prendergast, {{holding out}} his hand. 'I beg your pardon for having made such a fool of myself; but you see, since <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{understanding}} with that dear child, I have not thought of anything else, nor known what I was about.' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>As</b> World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end, {{the former}} NAS Hampton Roads saw erratic growth, growing to nearly 167 officers, 1,227 enlisted men and 65 planes. However, demobilization {{threatened}} {{the future of}} naval aviation. Within seven months of the war's end, Navy manpower fell to less than half its wartime highs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay," [...] said Friedel, [...] "thou shouldst {{say that}} <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> ledge where I had {{like to have}} stayed all night, but that ye all came out with men and ropes." ...|$|E
60|$|Again, {{with the}} hunger madness {{of a wild}} beast, I sprang forward to seize those tempting dishes; but, as before, the light went out and <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sudden stop against a hard wall.|$|E
6000|$|No {{sign of life}} I saw, as I pressed onward, [...] Fish, nor beast, nor bird, [...] Till <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> hill {{clothed in}} flowers to its summit, [...] Then shrill small voices I heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not, but at {{any rate}} one is liable to illness, to loss of sight, {{and all sorts of}} other things, and as we have between us four hundred a year we can manage very comfortably, even if <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end of my ardor for work and take to idleness again." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the turmoil}} of this day, the Ebert government's {{acceptance}} of the harsh terms of the Entente for a truce, after a renewed demand by the Supreme Command, went almost unnoticed. On 11 November, the Centre Party deputy Matthias Erzberger, on behalf of Berlin, signed the armistice agreement in Compiègne, France, and World War <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> end.|$|R
5000|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of Participants, Keating {{published}} an essay about writing the book on Stymie Magazine's website, stating, [...] "I do not like writing essays about writing. The closest <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> answer for why I write is to say: 'I write fiction because I sucked something awful as a poet.' This, of course, is true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then I dreamt <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> river, {{and the old}} ferryman said to me: [...] "For thirty year's the ferryman has rowed to and fro. Will {{the tired}} old man have to row much longer?"' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I scraped {{away the}} sand on the surface, {{and in a}} little while <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strip of paper hidden beneath, which had writing on it. The writing was signed with Anne Catherick's initials." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} half an hour <b>I</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> sudden standstill, for we {{were within}} a few paces {{of half a dozen}} white men, as could be told even in the {{darkness}} by the outlines of their clothing.|$|E
6000|$|... 'On the contrary, Tom Gradgrind, {{the more}} we say to-night, the better, I think. That is,' the {{consideration}} checked him, 'till I have said all I mean to say, and then I don't care how soon we stop. <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> question that may shorten the business. What {{do you mean by}} the proposal you made just now?' ...|$|R
60|$|But {{there are}} temptations {{which it is}} not in the power of human nature to resist, and few know what would be their case if driven to the same exigencies. As covetousness is the root of all evil, so poverty is, I believe, the worst of all snares. But I waive that {{discourse}} till <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> experiment.|$|R
60|$|Amid. Brother, <b>I</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> claim <b>a</b> sister's share: But you're {{too near}} me, to be nearer now.|$|R
