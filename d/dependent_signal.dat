GPCR agonist engagement {{allows for the}} G proteins to bind to the receptor leading to a classical downstream signalling cascade. The second mechanism is via the utilization of the β-arrestin signalling molecule and thirdly via transactivation <b>dependent</b> <b>signalling.</b> GPCRs can transactivate protein tyrosine kinase receptors (PTKR) to activate respective downstream signalling intermediates. In the past decade GPCR transactivation <b>dependent</b> <b>signalling</b> was expanded to show transactivation of serine/threonine kinase receptors (S/TKR). Kinase receptor transactivation enormously broadens the GPCR signalling paradigm. This work utilizes next generation RNA-sequencing to study the contribution of transactivation <b>dependent</b> <b>signalling</b> to total protease activated receptor (PAR) - 1 signalling. Transactivation, assessed as gene expression, accounted for 50 {{percent of the total}} genes regulated by thrombin acting through PAR- 1 in human coronary artery smooth muscle cells. GPCR transactivation of PTKRs is approximately equally important as the transactivation of the S/TKR with 209 and 177 genes regulated respectively, via either signalling pathway.

The oscillating electric field of a laser (or any time <b>dependent</b> <b>signal)</b> can be represented by a sum of sinusoidal signals in the frequency domain using the Fourier series. The oscillating electric field of a coherent, continuous-wave (cw) laser is represented as a single narrow peak in the frequency domain representation. If the laser is amplitude-modulated to produce a stable train of very short pulses (usually through mode-locking), the equivalent frequency domain representation is a series of narrow frequency peaks centered around the laser's original cw frequency. These frequency peaks are separated by the frequency of the time domain pulses. This is called the repetition rate of the frequency comb.|$|E

The oxygenation level <b>dependent</b> <b>signal,</b> known now as BOLD, {{has become the most}} popular because of its greater overall contrast/noise, but Kwong showed also that MRI could be used to detect a blood flow signal through the apparent change in T1 relaxation rates associated with the replenishment of blood in brain tissue, and demonstrated how the measured signal changes could be used to directly infer a quantitative measurement of the change in brain perfusion. This forms the basis of a second set of modern methods known now as arterial spin labeling, increasingly used when quantification of baseline and changing physiology is required. Kwongs was clearly the first work in this field to apply these methods to human brain mapping.|$|E

40|$|Blind signal {{separation}} {{into groups}} of <b>dependent</b> <b>signals</b> using joint block diagonalization Abstract — Multidimensional or group independent component analysis describes {{the task of}} transforming a multivariate observed sensor signal such that groups of the transformed signal components are mutually independent- however dependencies within the groups are still allowed. This generalization of independent component analysis (ICA) allows for weakening the sometimes too strict assumption of independence in ICA. It has potential applications in various fields such as ECG, fMRI analysis or convolutive ICA. Recently we could calculate the indeterminacies of group ICA, which finally enables us, also theoretically, to apply group ICA to solve blind source separation (BSS) problems.

We hypothesized that PI 3 K/Akt signaling may ameliorate septic shock by attenuating sepsis-induced cardiac dysfunction. Cardiac function and survival were evaluated in transgenic mice with cardiac myocyte specific expression of constitutively active PI 3 K isoform, p 110 a (caPI 3 K Tg). caPI 3 K Tg and wild type (WT) mice were subjected to cecal ligation/puncture (CLP) induced sepsis. Wild type CLP mice showed dramatic cardiac dysfunction at 6 hrs. Septic cardiomyopathy was significantly attenuated in caPI 3 K CLP mice. The time to 100 % mortality was 46 hrs in WT CLP mice. In contrast, 80 % of the caPI 3 K mice survived at 46 hrs after CLP (p, 0. 01) and 50 % survived. 30 days (p, 0. 01). Cardiac caPI 3 K expression prevented expression of an inflammatory phenotype in CLP sepsis. Organ neutrophil infiltration and lung apoptosis were also effectively inhibited by cardiac PI 3 k p 110 a expression.

40|$|Aberrant {{activation}} of sonic Hegdehog (SHH) signaling {{has been found}} to disrupt cellular differentiation in many human cancers and to increase proliferation. The SHH pathway is known to cross-talk with EGFR <b>dependent</b> <b>signaling.</b> Recent studies experimentally addressed this interplay in Daoy cells, which are presumable a model system for medulloblastoma, a highly malignant brain tumor that predominately occurs in children. Currently ongoing are several clinical trials for different solid cancers, which are designed to validate the clinical benefits of targeting the SHH in combination with other pathways. This has motivated us to investigate interactions between EGFR and SHH <b>dependent</b> <b>signaling</b> in greater depth. To our knowledge, there is no mathematical model describing the interplay between EGFR and SHH <b>dependent</b> <b>signaling</b> in medulloblastoma so far. Here we come up with a fully probabilistic approach using Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs). To build our model, we made use of literature based knowledge describing SHH and EGFR signaling and integrated gene expression (Illumina) and cellular location dependent time series protein expression data (Reverse Phase Protein Arrays). We validated our model by sub-sampling training data and making Bayesian predictions on the left out test data. Our predictions focusing on key transcription factors and p 70 S 6 K, showed a high level of concordance with experimental data. Furthermore, the stability of our model was tested by a parametric bootstrap approach. Stable network features were in agreement with published data. Altogether we believe that our model improved our understanding of the interplay between two highly oncogenic signaling pathways in Daoy cells.

40|$|Purpose: The {{increased}} {{signal-to-noise ratio}} and blood oxygen level <b>dependent</b> <b>signal</b> at ultra-high field can only help {{to boost the}} resolution in functional MRI studies if the spatial specificity of the activation signal is improved. At a field strength of 9. 4 T, both gradient-echo and spin-echo based echo-planar imaging were implemented and applied to investigate the specificity of human functional MRI. A finger tapping paradigm was used to acquire functional MRI data with scan parameters similar to standard neuroscientific applications. Methods: Spatial resolution, echo, and readout times were varied to determine their influence {{on the distribution of}} the blood oxygen level <b>dependent</b> <b>signal.</b> High-resolution co-localized images were used to classify the signal according to its origin in veins or tissue. Results: High-quality activation maps were obtained with both sequences. Signal contributions from tissue were found to be smaller or slightly larger than from veins. Gradient-echo echo-planar imaging yielded lower ratios of micro-/macro-vascular signals of around 0. 6 than spin-echo based functional MRI, where this ratio varied between 0. 75 and 1. 02, with higher values for larger echo and shorter readout time. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility of human functional MRI at 9. 4 T with high spatial specificity. Although venous contributions could not be entirely suppressed, venous effects in spin-echo echo-planar imaging are significantly reduced compared with gradient-echo echo-planar imaging...|$|E

Though the relative roles of each residue are similar with respect to stability and secretion, two distinct biological assays in L cells show that modification of C 93 primarily modulates signaling via a ß-catenin independent pathway while S 224 is crucial for ß-catenin <b>dependent</b> <b>signaling.</b> In addition, pharmacological inhibition of Porcupine (Porcn), an upstream regulator of Wnt, by IWP 1, specifically inhibited ß-catenin <b>dependent</b> <b>signaling.</b> Consistent with these observations, mapping of amino acids in peptide domains containing C 93 and S 224 demonstrate that acylation of C 93 is likely to be Porcn-independent while that of S 224 is Porcn-dependent.
