40|$|This {{paper is}} then {{focused on the}} European Neighbourhood Policy and democracypromotion in its Eastern neighbours. Can the EU act beyond ‘hard conditionality’ experiencedduring the {{enlargement}} process in order to succeed in democratizing its neighbourhood? Whatare the obstacles to democratisation and political change within the neighbours? At {{the heart of the}} analysis lies the question of efficiency of the ENP without hardconditionality linked with adhesion. Conditionality, i. e. linking the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> to thefulfilment of some conditions, has been {{at the core of the}} EU policy when dealing withaccession candidate countries. During the enlargement process, ‘hard conditionality’(describing measures a country must meet in order to access any money or politicalretribution) was the key means for democratic norms diffusion. By contrast, neighbourhoodpolicy uses conditionality in a more flexible way, which is tantamount to ‘soft conditionality’,destined to influence policies but not to propose a one-fits-for-all policy. It is often arguedthat because of the lack of an effective or ‘hard’ conditionality, the EU cannot pretend to amajor role as a promoter of democratic norms. enlargement...|$|E

40|$|Unions {{exist to}} provide {{assistance}} to employees; this is their reason for being. Yet once a union begins a campaign to represent a group of employees, it is legally barred from extending tangible assistance to the workers. The National Labor Relations Board (2 ̆ 2 NLRB 2 ̆ 2 or the 2 ̆ 2 Board 2 ̆ 2) and courts deem a union <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> to employees during or prior to a representation campaign objectionable conduct that requires setting aside {{the results of the}} representation election and holding another election. This article 2 ̆ 7 s proposal to open the door to unconditional union benefits during an organizing campaign will likely be controversial. Part of the controversy {{stems from the fact that}} the proposal would reverse a legal rule that has been in place for more than thirty years. A greater source of controversy will be that the proposal would allow unions to do something that employers are forbidden to do. Currently, both unions and employers are prohibited from granting employees unconditional benefits during an organizing campaign. Removing that prohibition just for unions would no doubt spur complaints by employers and their representatives, who would argue that the prohibitions on each side are currently equivalent, and it would therefore be unfair and unreasonable to remove the limit for just one side. This article proposes a policy change that the Board has full authority to carry out. The Board, in fact, created the prohibition on union <b>grants</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> and it should now revisit this policy. The prohibition is harmful to employees and limits their ability to make a fully informed and well reasoned choice in representation elections...|$|R

He ultimately obtained letters patent empowering him to plant and inhabit the land at Guiana, but was prevented by circumstances from visiting it again. The king renewed the grant on 28 August 1613 in favour of Harcourt and his heirs, Sir Thomas Challoner and John Rovenson. To promote the success of the scheme, Harcourt wrote an account of his adventures. A corporation of [...] "lords and gentlemen" [...] was formed and entrusted the conduct of the enterprise to Roger North. North, despite the opposition of Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, transported a hundred English settlers to Guiana (Oyapoc). He then obtained on 30 January 1626 a grant for incorporating his own and Harcourt's company with all customary privileges. The following April, Harcourt issued a Proposal for the formation of a Company of Adventurers to the river Amazon, and an enlarged edition of his book, with the conditions laid down by him for settlers in Guiana. Harcourt lost heavily on the speculation, and had to sell Ellenhall as well as his property at Wytham in Berkshire.|$|R
40|$|Acknowledging {{that its}} {{decision}} means that 2 ̆ 2 some household members 2 ̆ 2 may be without a 2 ̆ 2 critical social necessity, 2 ̆ 2 the Massachusetts Supreme Iudicial Court (SJC) ruled in Connors v. City of Boston that Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino 2 ̆ 7 s executive order granting health insurance {{benefits to the}} domestic partners of city employees could not stand {{in the face of}} a Massachusetts state insurance law. In Connors, the SJC simultaneously recognized that although the demographics of Massachusetts households have changed within the more than forty years since the state insurance law, G. L. c. 32 B (Chapter 32 B), was adopted, that law nevertheless constrains municipalities from extending health insurance benefits to the full range of household members who rely on city employees for their support. In other words, despite the court 2 ̆ 7 s recognition that families come in different forms, it decided it could not, as a technical matter, uphold a municipality 2 ̆ 7 s <b>grant</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> to non-traditional families where the legislature has failed to incorporate a contemporary definition of family into its state insurance law. The decision is an unfortunate departure from the general home rule authority jurisprudence of the Commonwealth, which, by constitutional amendment, makes local control the rule, rather than the exception. Although its reach is in one sense narrow [...] the ruling has no effect on either domestic partnership benefits provided by private employers or municipal domestic partner benefits other than group health insurance [...] it is in another sense very significant in that it strictly defines persons for whom cities and towns can expend funds to provide group health insurance benefits. The Author concludes that regardless of what political response the court 2 ̆ 7 s decision elicits, several things are clear in the aftermath of Connors. Hundreds of people throughout the Commonwealth have lost group health insurance coverage, coverage that is routinely provided to families of city workers as long as they are legal spouses, but is not provided to domestic partners. In its decision, the court pointed out the negative social consequences of this loss. It identified the problem, and it also identified its source and solution. The rest is up to the people and their representatives...|$|R

To show this impact, the probability to attend preschool is calculated for the children (i) P 1 —when there is an operational grant and children are allocated the new capacity and (ii) P 2 —when there is an operational grant and children are allocated the new capacity and there is also the positive income shock.

40|$|One way for {{employers}} {{to attract and}} retain the services of employees who {{are in a position to}} make a material contribution to the successful operation of the employer is to offer such selected employees the opportunity to participate in an employee share incentive scheme in terms of which they will receive certain benefits. Generally, a benefit derived from the participation in an employee share scheme is taxable as employment income where the <b>granting</b> <b>of</b> such <b>benefit</b> is linked to the employee’s employment or in respect of services rendered by that employee to his employer. Countries often have a different basis for the taxation <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> derived from participation in an employee share incentive scheme. In South Africa, the benefits from the participation in an employee share incentive scheme are taxed at the time such benefit vests (i. e when the employee becomes unconditionally entitled thereto). However, in Belgium, the benefits are taxed upfront at the time it is granted. While in India, the benefits are only taxed at the time of transfer or allotment (exercise). Where employees receive employee share incentive scheme <b>benefits</b> in respect <b>of</b> services rendered in more than one country, double taxation could occur as a result of each country taxing the benefits a different manner. If two or more countries seek tax the benefit or a portion thereof they often follow different approaches to the allocation, timing and characterisation of income derived from participation in an employee share incentive scheme. This could result in the measures which aim to prevent double taxation, in DTA’s as well as the South African domestic legislation, being ineffective. This study compares the tax treatment <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> derived from the participation in an employee share scheme in South Africa, Belgium and India which each follow a different approach to the taxation <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> derived from the participation in an employee share scheme. It aims to illustrate the possibility of double taxation from a South African resident perspective where DTAs and the South African legislation are not effective in eliminating double taxation.
