50|$|Subtractionless contrast-enhanced {{magnetic}} resonance angiography: {{recent developments in}} MRA technology {{have made it possible}} to create high quality contrast-enhanced MRA images without subtraction of a non-contrast enhanced mask image. This approach has been shown to improve diagnostic quality, because it prevents motion subtraction artifacts as well as an increase of image background noise, both direct results of the image subtraction. An important condition for this approach is to have excellent body <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> over large image areas, which is possible by using mDIXON acquisition methods. Traditional MRA suppresses signals originating from body fat during the actual image acquisition, which is a method that is sensitive to small deviations in the magnetic and electromagnetic fields and as a result may show insufficient <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> in some areas. mDIXON methods can distinguish and accurately separate image signals created by fat or water. By using the 'water images' for MRA scans, virtually no body fat is seen so that no subtraction masks are needed for high quality MR venograms.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the very}} short echo times (e.g., 1 to 2 milliseconds), the method does not suffer from off-resonance effects, so that the images neither exhibit {{susceptibility}} artifacts nor rely on <b>fat</b> <b>suppression.</b> While spoiled FLASH sequences offer spin density or T1 contrast, versions with refocused or fully balanced gradients provide access to T1/T2 contrast. The choice of the gradient-echo time (e.g., in-phase vs opposed-phase conditions) further alters the representation of water and fat signals in the images and will allow for separate water/fat movies.|$|E
40|$|In {{parallel}} 1 H MRSI, artifacts {{detrimental to}} spectral quality can {{be due to}} low sampling resolution and residual aliasing. We therefore introduce a novel reconstruction method that minimizes the deviation from a predefined target shape for the spectral response function (SRF). Based on undersampled 3 T in vivo MRSI data, we demonstrate that by this method, {{a significant reduction in}} spectral contamination originating from subcranial fat can be achieved. In particular, Gaussian target shapes lead to vastly improved <b>fat</b> artifact <b>suppression</b> compared to standard reconstruction...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explain a}} cause of high signal {{intensity}} on T 1 -weighted MR images in calcified intervertebral disks associated with spinal fusion. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Magnetic resonance and radiological examinations of 13 patients were reviewed, presenting one or several intervertebral disks showing a high signal intensity on T 1 -weighted MR images, associated both {{with the presence of}} calcifications in the disks and with peripheral fusion of the corresponding spinal segments. Fusion was due to ligament ossifications (n= 8), ankylosing spondylitis (n= 4), or posterior arthrodesis (n= 1). Imaging files included X-rays and T 1 -weighted MR images in all cases, T 2 -weighted MR images in 12 cases, MR images with <b>fat</b> signal <b>suppression</b> in 7 cases, and a CT scan in 1 case. Histological study of a calcified disk from an anatomical specimen of an ankylosed lumbar spine resulting from ankylosing spondylitis was examined. RESULTS: The signal intensity of the disks was {{similar to that of the}} bone marrow or of perivertebral fat both on T 1 -weighted MR images and on all sequences, including those with <b>fat</b> signal <b>suppression.</b> In one of these disks, a strongly negative absorption coefficient was focally measured by CT scan, suggesting a fatty content. The histological examination of the ankylosed calcified disk revealed the presence of well-differentiated bone tissue and fatty marrow within the disk. CONCLUSION: The high signal intensity of some calcified intervertebral disks on T 1 -weighted MR images can result from the presence of fatty marrow, probably related to a disk ossification process in ankylosed spines...|$|R

Overall, radiographic features for idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome vary widely. They include inflammation of the extraocular muscles (myositis) with tendinous involvement, orbital fat stranding, lacrimal gland inflammation and enlargement (dacryoadenitis), involvement of the optic sheath complex, uvea, and sclera, a focal intraorbital mass or even diffuse orbital involvement.

50|$|On MR {{examination}} {{there is}} hypointensity in T1 weighted imaging (WI), particularly in sclerosing disease. T1WI with contrast will show moderate to marked diffuse irregularity and enhancement of involved structures. T2 weighted imaging with <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> will show iso- or slight hyperintensity compared to muscle. There is also decreased signal intensity compared to most orbital lesions due to cellular infiltrate and fibrosis. In chronic disease or sclerosing variant, T2WI with FS will show hypointensity (due to fibrosis). Findings on STIR (Short T1 Inversion Recovery) {{are similar to}} those on T2WI FS. In Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, findings include enhancement and fullness of the anterior cavernous sinus and superior orbital fissure in T1WI with contrast, while MRA may show narrowing of cavernous sinus internal carotid artery (ICA).|$|E
5000|$|Measurements of the T2 {{relaxation}} rate {{of nerve}} by Filler and Howe revealed that previous {{reports of a}} short relaxation time were wrong and that - once signal from lipid protons was suppressed - the primary image signal from nerve had long T2 relaxation rates best imaged with pulse sequence echo times {{in the range of}} 50 to 100 milliseconds. In addition, they later showed that T2-neurography differs from most other MR imaging in that the conspicuity or relative prominence of nerve is affected by the angle of voxel orientation during the acquisition of the image. When acquisitions are done with echo times below 40 milliseconds, there can be [...] "magic angle effects" [...] that provide some spurious information, so MR Neurography is always done with echo times greater than 40 milliseconds. The need for long echo times also characterizes the type of inversion recovery <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> sequences used for neurography nerve imaging.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} the ultrasound findings of lipoma arborescens arising in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa. Ultrasound examinations were performed in seven shoulder joints of six patients with shoulder pain and functional limitations, {{as well as}} suspected rotator cuff abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was also performed in all cases. T 1 -weighted spin-echo and T 2 -weighted turbo spin-echo images, and a proton density-weighted sequence with <b>fat</b> spectral <b>suppression</b> or a short inversion time inversion recovery were obtained in a 1. 5 -T unit. Synovial-based hyperechoic villous proliferations and a diffuse synovial thickening associated with a sonolucent effusion in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa were seen in all cases. Color Doppler showed no vascularisation {{in any of the}} cases. The fatty nature of the synovial hyperechoic proliferations was confirmed by MRI in all cases. In conclusion, ultrasonographic findings of lipoma arborescens arising in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa suggest villous hyperechoic synovial proliferations associated with an effusion. Confirmation of the fatty nature of the synovial proliferation should be performed with MRI, which allows an unequivocal diagnosis...|$|R

40|$|Some mammals, {{including}} laboratory mice, enter torpor {{in response}} to food deprivation, and leptin can attenuate these bouts of torpor. We previously showed that dopamine beta-hydroxylase knockout (Dbh -/-) mice, which lack norepinephrine (NE), do not reduce circulating leptin upon fasting nor do they enter torpor. To test whether the onset of torpor in mice during a fast requires a NE-mediated reduction in circulating leptin, double mutant mice deficient in both leptin (ob/ob) and DBH (DBL MUT) were generated. Upon fasting, control and ob/ob mice entered torpor as assessed by telemetric core T(b) acquisition. While fasting failed to induce torpor in Dbh -/- mice, leptin deficiency bypassed the requirement for NE, as DBL MUT mice readily entered torpor upon fasting. These data indicate that sympathetic activation of white <b>fat</b> and <b>suppression</b> of leptin {{is required for the}} onset of torpor in the mouse. Emergence from torpor was severely retarded in DBL MUT mice, revealing a novel, leptin-independent role for NE in torpor recovery. This phenotype was mimicked by administration of a beta(3) adrenergic receptor antagonist to control mice during a torpor bout. Hence, NE signaling via beta(3) adrenergic receptors presumably in brown fat is the first neurotransmitter-receptor system identified that is required for normal recovery from torpor...|$|R
30|$|Common {{problems}} in MRI of reconstructed breasts are failure of <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> and inhomogeneous <b>fat</b> <b>suppression.</b> Field homogeneity {{can be improved}} by adjustment of the shim gradients and ensuring that shim volumes adequately cover the breast tissue.

40|$|Hepatic {{steatosis}} is a core {{feature of}} the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes and leads to hepatic insulin resistance. Malonyl-CoA, generated by acetyl-CoA carboxylases 1 and 2 (Acc 1 and Acc 2), is a key regulator of both mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and fat synthesis. We used a diet-induced rat model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and hepatic insulin resistance to explore the impact of suppressing Acc 1, Acc 2, or both Acc 1 and Acc 2 on hepatic lipid levels and insulin sensitivity. While suppression of Acc 1 or Acc 2 expression with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) increased fat oxidation in rat hepatocytes, suppression of both enzymes with a single ASO was significantly more effective in promoting <b>fat</b> oxidation. <b>Suppression</b> of Acc 1 also inhibited lipogenesis whereas Acc 2 reduction {{had no effect on}} lipogenesis. In rats with NAFLD, suppression of both enzymes with a single ASO was required to significantly reduce hepatic malonyl-CoA levels in vivo, lower hepatic lipids (long-chain acyl-CoAs, diacylglycerol, and triglycerides), and improve hepatic insulin sensitivity. Plasma ketones were significantly elevated compared with controls in the fed state but not in the fasting state, indicating that lowering Acc 1 and - 2 expression increases hepatic fat oxidation specifically in the fed state. These studies suggest that pharmacological inhibition of Acc 1 and - 2 may be a novel approach in the treatment of NAFLD and hepatic insulin resistance...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Postnuptial molt is {{the major}} molt that oc-curs in most wild and {{domestic}} avian species each year. The process {{is much more than}} the replacement of feath-ers. Studies have shown that a significant increase in metabolic rate, increase in whole body protein synthesis, osteoporosis, loss of body <b>fat,</b> and a <b>suppression</b> of the immune system occur during this event of a birdâ€™s annual cycle. Several procedures have been developed to initiate feather replacement, and this review addresses hormonal and neuropeptide treatments that effected molt. The ad-ministration of thyroxine, progesterone, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist, and prolactin were examined. Of the four, the two most effective were thyroxine and prolactin administration. The neural modulators known to release thyroxine and prolactin, respectively, are thy-roid hormone releasing hormone (TRH) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). To gain insight into the pos-sible functions of VIP and TRH, the distribution of these neuromodulators and their terminal fields were reviewed in the avian brain. It was found that VIP-containing neu...|$|R
40|$|SummarySubcutaneous (SC) and visceral (VIS) obesity are {{associated}} with different risks of diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. To elucidate whether these differences are due to anatomic location or intrinsic differences in adipose depots, we characterized mice after transplantation of SC or VIS fat from donor mice into either SC or VIS regions of recipient mice. The group with SC fat transplanted into the VIS cavity exhibited decreased body weight, total fat mass, and glucose and insulin levels. These mice also exhibited improved insulin sensitivity during hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps with increased whole-body glucose uptake, glucose uptake into endogenous <b>fat,</b> and insulin <b>suppression</b> of hepatic glucose production. These effects were observed {{to a lesser extent}} with SC fat transplanted to the SC area, whereas VIS fat transplanted to the VIS area was without effect. These data suggest that SC fat is intrinsically different from VIS fat and produces substances that can act systemically to improve glucose metabolism...|$|R

METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers and one patient with a malignant breast lesion were scanned at 7 T. The MRI protocol contained 3 D T 1 -weighted gradient echo images obtained with both WSE <b>fat</b> <b>suppression,</b> multi echo Dixon <b>fat</b> <b>suppression,</b> and without <b>fat</b> <b>suppression.</b> Images were acquired at a (0. 8 mm) (3) or (0. 7 mm) (3) isotropic resolution with equal field of view and optimized such to obtain a maximal SNR. Image quality was scored qualitatively on overall image quality, sharpness of anatomical details, presence of artifacts, inhomogeneous <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> and the presence of water-fat shift. A quantitative scoring was obtained from the signal to noise ratio and contrast to noise ratio. RESULTS: WSE scored significantly better in terms of overall image quality and the absence of artifacts. No significant difference in contrast to noise ratio was found between the two <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> methods.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis : Overproduction of VLDL 1 {{seems to}} be the central {{pathophysiological}} feature of the dyslipidaemia associated with type 2 diabetes. We explored the relationship between liver <b>fat</b> and <b>suppression</b> of VLDL 1 production by insulin in participants with a broad range of liver fat content. Methods : A multicompartmental model was used to determine the kinetic parameters of apolipoprotein B and TG in VLDL 1 and VLDL 2 after a bolus of [2 H 3]leucine and [2 H 5]glycerol during a hyperinsulinaemicâ€“euglycaemic clamp in 20 male participants: eight with type 2 diabetes and 12 control volunteers. The participants were divided into two groups with low or high liver fat. All participants with diabetes were in the high liver-fat group. Results : The results showed a rapid drop in VLDL 1 -apolipoprotein B and -triacylglycerol secretion in participants with low liver fat during the insulin infusion. In contrast, participants with high liver fat showed no significant change in VLDL 1 secretion. The VLDL 1 suppression following insulin infusion correlated with the suppression of NEFA, and the ability of insulin to suppress the plasma NEFA was impaired in participants with high liver fat. A novel finding was an inverse response between VLDL 1 and VLDL 2 secretion in participants with low liver fat: VLDL 1 secretion decreased acutely after insulin infusion whereas VLDL 2 secretion increased. Conclusions/interpretation : Insulin downregulates VLDL 1 secretion and increases VLDL 2 secretion in participants with low liver fat but fails to suppress VLDL 1 secretion in participants with high liver fat, resulting in overproduction of VLDL 1. Thus, liver fat is associated with lack of VLDL 1 suppression in response to insulin...|$|R

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a prospective study of 71 consecutive patients that were submitted to MRI of the liver using a 1. 5 T magnet. The six following pulse sequences were used: 1) fat-suppressed respiratory triggered with conventional body coil; 2) breath-hold fat-suppressed with conventional body coil; 3) non-suppressed respiratory triggered with conventional body coil; 4) breath-hold non fat-suppressed with conventional body coil; 5) fat-suppressed respiratory triggered with phased-array multicoil; 6) breath-hold fat-suppressed with phased-array multicoil. Images were analyzed quantitatively by measuring the signal-to-noise ratios and qualitatively by evaluating the sharpness of hepatic contours, visibility of intrahepatic vessels and other segmental landmarks, {{and the presence of}} artifacts. RESULTS: The qualitative analysis showed that the mean values obtained with the six sequences were 7. 8, 4. 6, 7. 9, 5. 2, 6. 7 and 4. 6, respectively. The respiratory-triggered sequences were better than the breath-hold sequences in both qualitative and quantitative analysis (p 0. 05). The sequences using the body coil were similar in terms of image quality (p > 0. 05) and better regarding signal-to-noise ratios than those obtained with the phased-array multicoil (p 0, 05).

40|$|Lean healthy {{individuals}} {{are characterized by}} the ability to rapidly adapt metabolism to acute changes in substrate availability and metabolic rate. However, in glucose-intolerance/insulin-resistant conditions, such as that induced by starvation, the flexibility of tissues to rapidly respond to change in substrate availability is diminished. We asked whether the conundrum of increased glucose demand by the contracting skeletal muscle during prolonged exercise and the glucose intolerance of starvation {{would result in the}} obstruction of oxidative disposal of ingested 13 C-labeled glucose during exercise. Seven lean, healthy, physically active individuals (2 women, 5 men) completed a randomized crossover study comparing the effects of the normal-fed condition vs a 67 -hour water-only fast on the metabolic response to carbohydrate ingestion during 80 minutes of exercise at 56 % of maximum oxygen uptake. Compared with the normal condition, fasting resulted in a large overall increase in the rate of fat oxidation (mean effect, 71 %; 95 % confidence limit, Â± 22 %) and moderate reductions in both exogenous (âˆ’ 54 %, Â± 10 %) and endogenous (âˆ’ 40 %, Â± 19 %) glucose oxidation rates during exercise. Over the course of exercise, fat oxidation was impermeable to change in the fasting condition, but increased moderately (33 %, Â± 19 %) in the normal condition. These changes were associated with a large increase in plasma free fatty-acid concentration (120 %, Â± 64 %) and a moderate increase in blood lactate concentration (58 %, Â± 50 %). In contrast, large reductions in resting blood glucose (âˆ’ 21 %, Â± 14 %) and moderate reductions in plasma insulin concentrations (âˆ’ 47 %, Â± 26 %) were observed in the fast condition; but this effect was reversed for glucose (30 %, Â± 24 %) and negated for insulin by the end of exercise. To conclude, a 67 -hour fast leads to an impermeable increase in <b>fat</b> oxidation, <b>suppression</b> of both exogenous and endogenous carbohydrate oxidation, and a metabolic response consistent with resistance to contraction-induced exogenous glucose uptake and oxidation...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{conventional}} fat-suppressed MR {{images of}} the breast to images derived from high spectral and spatial resolution MR data. Image quality {{and the level of}} <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> are compared qualitatively and quantitatively. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Women with suspicious breast lesions found on X-ray mammography were imaged on 1. 5 Tesla GE SIGNA scanners. High spectral and spatial resolution (HiSS) data were acquired using echo-planar spectroscopic imaging. Images with intensity proportional to the water signal peak height in each voxel were synthesized. Conventional fat-suppressed images were acquired using a frequency selective inversion method. The experimental (HiSS) and conventional images were compared by experienced radiologists to evaluate the quality of <b>fat</b> <b>suppression.</b> In addition, <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> and image quality were evaluated quantitatively.

40|$|<b>Fat</b> <b>suppression</b> is {{commonly}} used in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging to suppress the signal from adipose tissue or detect adipose tissue. <b>Fat</b> <b>suppression</b> can be achieved with three methods: fat saturation, inversion-recovery imaging, and opposed-phase imaging. Selection of a <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> technique should depend on {{the purpose of the}} <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> (contrast enhancement vs tissue characterization) and the amount of fat in the tissue being studied. Fat saturation is recommended for suppression of signal from large amounts of fat and reliable acquisition of contrast material-enhanced images. The main drawbacks of this technique are sensitivity to magnetic field nonuniformity, misregistration artifacts, and unreliability when used with low-field-strength magnets. Inversion-recovery imaging allows homogeneous and global <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> and can be used with low-field-strength magnets. However, this technique is not specific for fat, and the signal intensity of tissue with a long T 1 and tissue with a short T 1 may be ambiguous. Opposed-phase imaging is a fast and readily available technique. This method is recommended for demonstration of lesions that contain small amounts of fat. The main drawback of opposed-phase imaging is unreliability in the detection of small tumors embedded in fatty tissue...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To improve fat {{saturation}} in coronary MRA at 3 T {{by using}} a spectrally selective adiabatic T 2 -Prep (WSA-T 2 -Prep). METHODS: A conventional adiabatic T 2 -Prep (CA-T 2 -Prep) was modified, such that the excitation and restoration pulses were of differing bandwidths. On-resonance spins are T 2 -Prepared, whereas off-resonance spins, such as fat, are spoiled. This approach was combined with a CHEmically Selective Saturation (CHESS) pulse to achieve even greater <b>fat</b> <b>suppression.</b> Numerical simulations were followed by phantom validation and in vivo coronary MRA. RESULTS: Numerical simulations demonstrated that augmenting a CHESS pulse with a WSA-T 2 -Prep improved robustness to B 1 inhomogeneities and that this combined <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> was effective over a broader spectral range {{than that of a}} CHESS pulse in a conventional T 2 -Prepared sequence. Phantom studies also demonstrated that the WSA-T 2 -Prep+CHESS combination produced greater <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> across a range of B 1 values than did a CA-T 2 -Prep+CHESS combination. Lastly, in vivo measurements demonstrated that the contrast-to-noise ratio between blood and myocardium was not adversely affected {{by using a}} WSA-T 2 -Prep, despite the improved abdominal and epicardial <b>fat</b> <b>suppression.</b> Additionally, vessel sharpness improved. CONCLUSION: The proposed WSA-T 2 -Prep method was shown to improve <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> and vessel sharpness as compared to a CA-T 2 -Prep technique, and to also increase <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> when combined with a CHESS pulse...|$|E
40|$|The enzymes {{lipoprotein}} lipase (LPL, EC 3. 1. 1. 34) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL, EC 3. 1. 1. 3) apparently catalyze opposing functions in white adipose tissue: {{the former is}} concerned with fat storage, the latter with fat mobilization. We have studied their regulation in vivo in normal subjects in the postabsorptive state and after eating meals of different compositions, by measurement of arteriovenous concentration differences for triacylglycerol, non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol across a subcutaneous adipose depot. The two enzymes are regulated in a broadly reciprocal manner: in the overnight-fasted state, HSL is more active, but after a meal HSL is suppressed whilst LPL is activated. The movement of fatty acids {{in and out of}} adipose tissue appears to be driven by concentration gradients generated by regulation of these two enzymes, and also by activation, in the postprandial period, of the process of fatty acid esterification. The results show some interesting and perhaps unexpected features of metabolic regulation. Of the fatty acids generated by the action of LPL on circulating TAG, a large proportion is released directly into the venous plasma: close to 100 % in the overnight-fasted state, and 50 % or more at the peak of LPL action after a meal, making what appear reasonable assumptions. We suggest that this apparent 'inefficiency' of fat storage reflects the energetic cost of maintaining precise control over such a fundamental process. Although LPL is usually thought of as the enzyme regulating fat deposition, in fact the fatty acids and glycerol it releases from circulating TAG represent a substantial proportion of those released from adipose tissue, especially in the postprandial state. In addition, although HSL is considered the enzyme responsible for <b>fat</b> mobilization, <b>suppression</b> of its activity is essential to normal regulation of fat deposition. Thus, fat storage and fat mobilization during normal daily life are controlled by coordinated regulation of a number of enzymatic processes in white adipose tissue...|$|R

We also found that the number of completed pregnancies, C-reactive protein, aspartate aminotransferase, and progesterone were more strongly associated with amounts of glandular tissue than adipose tissue, while fat body mass, alanine aminotransferase, and insulin like growth factor-II appear to be more associated with the amount of breast adipose tissue. Our results show that methods of breast imaging and modalities for estimating the amount of glandular tissue have no effects on the strength of these predictors of BD.

Methods: Eighty-one HIV protease inhibitor recipients (78 male; mean antiretroviral therapy, 55 months) with predominant peripheral lipoatrophy, HIV RNA < 400 copies/ml plasma for at least the preceding 6 months, and no prior abacavir, non-nucleoside analogue or adefovir therapy were randomized 3 : 2 to continue nucleoside analogues and substitute protease inhibitor(s) with abacavir, nevirapine, adefovir and hydroxyurea (n = 49) or to continue all therapy (n = 32) with an option to switch at week 24. The primary endpoints were total body fat and HIV RNA at week 24. Other assessments were regimen safety, regional body composition, metabolic parameters, quality of life, and CD 4 T-lymphocyte counts to week 48. Results: There was a greater decline in total body fat in the switch group than in the continue group (- 1. 6 and - 0. 4 kg, respectively at week 24;P = 0. 006). This comprised greater declines in limb and subcutaneous abdominal fat, and in intra-abdominal fat of patients with moderate or severe abdominal <b>fat</b> accumulation. Viral <b>suppression</b> was similar, despite 18 (37...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} improve the <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> {{performance}} of in vivo 13 C-MRS operating at 3. 0 Tesla, a phantom model study was conducted {{using a combination of}} two <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> techniques; a set of pulses for frequency (chemical shift) selective suppression (CHESS), and spatial saturation (SAT). By optimizing the slab thickness for SAT and the irradiation bandwidth for CHESS, the signals of the â€“ 13 CH 3 peak at 49 ppm and the â€“ 13 CH 2 â€“ peak at 26 ppm simulating fat components were suppressed to 5 % and 19 %, respectively. Combination of these two <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> pulses achieved a 53 % increase of the height ratio of the glucose C 1 O peak compared with the sum of all other peaks, indicating better sensitivity for glucose signal detection. This method will be applicable for in vivo 13 C-MRS by additional adjustment with the in vivo relaxation times of the metabolites.

30|$|As {{defined by}} the ankle MRI {{protocol}} at our institution, all patients were positioned supine on the examination table within the magnetic bore. We obtained five series of MR images, including coronal fast spin echo (FSE) T 2 -weighted images with <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> (TR/TE, 2, 816 / 96 Â ms), sagittal SE T 1 -weighted images (TR/TE, 527 / 20 Â ms), sagittal FSE T 2 -weighted images with <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> (TR/TE, 2, 816 / 96 Â ms), axial SE T 1 -weighted images (TR/TE, 414 / 40 Â ms), and axial FSE T 2 -weighted images with <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> (TR/TE, 4, 022 / 96 Â ms), using MRI machines (MAGNETOM Symphony 1.5 Â T; Siemens Healthcare/Signa Excite 1.5 Â T; GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA).|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the degree of}} inhomogeneities of <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> using the fully automated three-dimensional breast shimming technique (Image Based-Smart: IB-Smart) and manual setting of a rectangular parallelepiped shim (volume shimming) in MR mammography. Information on breast shape was collected from 9 patients whose images were insufficiently fat-suppressed. A breast phantom made of a thermoplastic sheet was used. Shimming of the magnetic field was done with IB-Smart and various dimensions of volume shims: the anterior to posterior/right to left/head to foot directions were set to 75 - 150 / 150 - 350 / 50 - 150 mm. The volumes of inhomogeneously suppressed fat were measured. The calculated volume with inhomogeneous <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> with use of IB-Smart was 13. 3 Ã— 10 4 mm 3. The smallest volume of inhomogeneous <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> with volume shimming was 5. 4 Ã— 104 mm 3 when the anterior-posterior/right-left/head-foot directions were set to 75 / 350 / 50 mm. Our results show that using optimized dimensions of volume shims enables better <b>fat</b> <b>suppression</b> than does IB-Smart.

40|$|Ghrelin, {{the growth}} hormone secretagogue {{receptor}} ligand, {{is a key}} regulator of adiposity and food intake. However, the regulation of ghrelin in response to dietary fat intake remains largely unclear. Furthermore, cephalic elevation of ghrelin may influence fat absorption and postprandial lipaemia. Therefore, {{the aim of this}} study was to examine the effect of fat ingestion and vagal stimulation on the regulation of plasma ghrelin. Vagal stimulation was achieved by modified sham feeding (MSF). Eight healthy subjects (four male/four female) consumed a 50 g fat load on two separate occasions. On one occasion, the fat load was preceded by the MSF of a meal for 1 h. Blood, appetite and breath were analysed for 5 h postprandially. A 25 % (S. E. M. 3. 4) suppression in ghrelin concentration was observed after fat ingestion (P< 0. 001), without an increase in glucose or insulin. MSF in addition to oral <b>fat</b> enhanced ghrelin <b>suppression</b> further, as well as elevating plasma triacylglycerol (P< 0. 001) and reducing appetite (P< 0. 001). The fasting ghrelin concentration was inversely correlated with gastric half-emptying time (P= 0. 036). We conclude that ghrelin release may be influenced directly by both vagal stimulation and oral fat ingestion...|$|R
40|$|To {{elucidate}} the inhibiting mechanisms of fat accumulation by catechins, caffeine, and epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), ICR mice were fed diets containing either 0. 3 % catechins or 0. 1 % EGCG and/or 0. 05 % caffeine for 4 weeks. After the feeding, intraperitoneal adipose tissues weights {{were significantly lower}} in the caffeine, catechins[*]+[*]caffeine, and EGCG[*]+[*]caffeine groups compared to controls. Hepatic fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity in the catechins[*]+[*]caffeine group was significantly lower, and the activities of acyl-CoA oxidase (ACO) and carnitine palmitoyltransferase-II (CPT-II) were significantly higher, compared to the control group. However, these activities were not observed in the other groups. FAS mRNA expression levels in the catechins[*]+[*]caffeine group were significantly lower than in the control group. ACO and CPT-II mRNA levels were not different among all of the treatment groups. These findings indicate that the inhibitory effects of fat accumulation via a combination of catechins, EGCG, or caffeine were stronger collectively than by either catechins, EGCG, or caffeine alone. Moreover, it was demonstrated {{that the combination of}} catechins and caffeine induced inhibition of <b>fat</b> accumulation by <b>suppression</b> of fatty acid synthesis and upregulation of the enzymatic activities involved in Î²-oxidation of fatty acid in the liver, but this result was not observed by combination of EGCG and caffeine...|$|R
40|$|A major {{disadvantage}} of conventional seed radiography {{is that the}} resulting image will not distinguish full-viable seeds from full-nonviable. Empty seeds will imbibe sufficient water to appear full, but these are easily distinguished by radiography before imbibition. Full seeds, both viable and nonviable, have 25 to 35 % moisture content when freshly collected. This is sufficient water to confuse interpretation due to radiopacity of water density. While the full-viable seeds will germinate, the full-nonviable ones will not germinate due to physiological rather than morphological conditions, even while they maintain a moisture content sufficient to support germination. Speculation points to distribution and availability of free water and fat as promising factors to determine if an otherwise healthy seed will germinate. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will determine these distributions. MRI is a nondestructive, noninvasive method suitable to seed research and ultimate germination of viable seeds. Although it is a widely used medical procedure, there are only limited applications to tree seed physiology. Specific differences reported in this paper are primarily the distribution and abundance of mobile hydrogen (H+) protons in bulk free water and in lipid molecules or parts of long chains. The difference in images was obtained by using <b>fat</b> and water <b>suppression</b> techniques utilising the small differences in resonant frequencies between H+ in bulk water and lipids...|$|R
