40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this paper focuses upon FRP stay-in-place participating <b>formwork</b> <b>for</b> use in <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> construction. Ease of construction is the prime motivation for the development of such a system. Time saving on site can be achieved by elimination of hand laying of internal reinforcement and provision of temporary support since all reinforcement is built into the formwork itself and is self-supporting. The crucial part of this research is investigating the most appropriate method of achieving robust bond between concrete and FRP formwork. The failure of conventional adhesive bonds is brittle and failure may occur without any warning. Therefore a more robust mechanical interlock at the interface between concrete and FRP is required to allow sufficient deformability to be created in this composite system with a more gradual failure mode. This might be achieved via transverse reinforcement in the concrete, integral with the formwork. To study the behaviour of both pultruded GFRP grid and moulded GFRP grating as mechanical shear connectors to achieve such bond between the formwork and concrete, a series of push-out tests on 300 Ã— 400 mm slab specimens have been conducted. From the resulting stress-slip curves, the longitudinal shear behaviour of both systems has been established. The test results indicate the feasibility of using moulded grating with vertical rods as shear-keys with reasonable ductility. The result of the tests will be used to provide guidance for the design of full slabs...|$|R

40|$|Topology {{optimisation}} of continuum structures {{has gained}} important industrial relevance in recent years. Size optimisation, although used widely {{in practice and}} in research environments, has generally been developed to an advanced stage for optimisation of discrete elements such as frames and trusses. Size optimisation of continuum elements {{on the other hand}} has generally focussed on not more than a few design variables such as thickness or Young&rsquo;s modulus. As a result, size optimisation of continuum elements has not found its way in design practice for civil structures such as <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> and structural walls. The work in this thesis presents the development of a practice-oriented approach and the corresponding computer programs for the flexural and shear design of <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> in buildings. Thickness optimisation of structural walls and layout design of bracing systems in multi-storey buildings are also investigated. New techniques have been developed {{in the course of this}} work and novel solutions have been obtained that satisfy practical design code requirements and demonstrate economic benefits. The new tools developed are to be used at the conceptual and preliminary stages of design. The basic concepts of Evolutionary Structural Optimisation (ESO) method of structural optimisation are employed and extended for element removal and sizing operations. The focus of this work therefore is on applying the ESO method of structural optimisation to the design of continuum elements such as <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> and structural walls in real 3 D multi-storey buildings. The optimal solutions <b>for</b> <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> are obtained by repeated finite element analysis and element sizing till all the constraints are satisfied or no further improvement can be achieved. Rather than using few simple examples to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed techniques, the work in this thesis is mostly example-oriented to comprehensively demonstrate the applicability and benefit of the proposed techniques in a wide variety of situations and building models. The potential benefits of using the new design tools are demonstrated by design and cost comparisons of the optimal solutions with the industry partner&rsquo;s conventional, non-optimised designs for his real projects...|$|R

The authors in this paper analyze some new logical views on the issue of building <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> <b>Floor</b> <b>slabs</b> are analyzed {{not only in terms of}} capacity, but also in terms of energy efficiency and safety during seismic activity. The authors offer a solution to build adaptive large residential and commercial area with the possibility of achieving cheaper and more competitive construction with the same gain (profit) in relation to the set of the classic construction and a high selling price. If you require the ability to achieve high capacity with longer spans, less weight and less prone to earthquakes, you can easily come to the conclusion that light grate cluster AB boards have an advantage over other solutions <b>for</b> building <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> Excitation due to possible levelling of supports or torsion rotation of the object is practically possible.

40|$|Sever {{fires in}} {{buildings}} {{can lead to}} local failures, instability, partial or total collapse of the structure. In majority of the times, fire is a secondary event, after blast or impact, while the building has experienced some damage. Examples of widely known events include the 1968 Ronan Point collapse in the UK, the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the World Trade Center Collapse in New York in 2001, the 2014 collapse of a building at New Yorkâ€™s Harlem neighborhood due to a gas explosion, and the recent 2015 collapse of a building at New Yorkâ€™s East Village also due to a gas explosion. The initial shock to the building can be conservatively modeled by removing an intermediate vertical supporting element (i. e. loss of load-carrying capacity in a critical element), leading to an increased span <b>for</b> composite <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> In a lowrise building, if there is enough reinforcement throughout the slab and enough continuity and restraint, despite large deflections that will develop, the slab is capable of carrying the loads by membrane action. Fundamentally, the floor system behaves as an inverted dome structure with radial tensile forces and a compressive hoop stresses. This holds true at ambient temperature, yet a similar resisting mechanism forms during fire. Previous research and experimental work shows that fire performance of composite <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> {{can be used to}} reduce the fire protection requirement of the steel elements, i. e. the designer should take advantage of reserve capacity in the composite <b>floor</b> <b>slab</b> membrane action. The utilization of membrane action in the design of composite <b>floor</b> <b>slabs</b> has been used, to some extent, for mitigating collapse from single events (blast or fire only). Given that, often the initial blast is followed by a secondary fire event, this work investigates the system-level performance of low-rise damaged buildings subject to post-blast fires. The hypothesis is that, when incorporated in the design, low-rise buildings can withstand the post-blast fires through membrane action of composite <b>floor</b> <b>slabs.</b> Application of this concept, within a performance-based framework, can be used to avoid progressive collapse, or at the minimum increase fire resistance to allow for safe evacuation.
