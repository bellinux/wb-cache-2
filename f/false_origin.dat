2500|$|The name spud {{for a small}} potato {{comes from}} the digging of soil (or a hole) prior to the {{planting}} of potatoes. The word has an unknown origin and was originally (c. 1440) used as a term for a short knife or dagger, probably related to the Latin [...] "spad-" [...] a word root meaning [...] "sword"; cf. Spanish [...] "espada", English [...] "spade" [...] and [...] "spadroon". It subsequently transferred over {{to a variety of}} digging tools. Around 1845, the name transferred to the tuber itself. The origin of the word [...] "spud" [...] has erroneously been attributed to a 19th-century activist group dedicated to keeping the potato out of Britain, calling itself The Society for the Prevention of an Unwholesome Diet (S.P.U.D.). It was Mario Pei's 1949 The Story of Language that can be blamed for the word's <b>false</b> <b>origin.</b> Pei writes, [...] "the potato, for its part, was in disrepute some centuries ago. Some Englishmen who did not fancy potatoes formed a Society for the Prevention of Unwholesome Diet. The initials of the main words in this title gave rise to spud."

40|$|Abstract—False routing {{announcements}} are {{a serious}} security problem, {{which can lead}} to widespread service disruptions in the Internet. A number of detection systems have been proposed and implemented recently, however, it takes time to detect attacks, notify operators, and stop false announcements. Thus detection systems should be complemented by a mitigation scheme that can protect data delivery before the attack is resolved. We propose such a mitigation scheme, QBGP, which decouples the propagation of a path and the adoption of a path for data forwarding. QBGP does not use suspicious paths to forward data traffic, but still propagates them in the routing system to facilitate attack detection. It can protect data delivery from routing announcements of <b>false</b> sub-prefixes, <b>false</b> <b>origins,</b> <b>false</b> nodes and false links. QBGP incurs overhead only when there are suspicious paths, which happen infrequently in real BGP traces. Results from large scale simulations and BGP trace analysis show that QBGP is light-weight yet effective, and it converges faster and incurs less overhead than Pretty Good BGP. I...|$|R
5000|$|The Airy {{ellipsoid}} is {{a regional}} best fit for Britain; more modern mapping tends {{to use the}} GRS80 ellipsoid used by the Global Positioning System (the Airy ellipsoid assumes the Earth to be about 1 km smaller in diameter than the GRS80 ellipsoid, and to be slightly less flattened). The British maps adopt a Transverse Mercator projection with an origin (the [...] "true" [...] origin) at 49° N, 2° W (an offshore point in the English Channel which lies between the island of Jersey and the French port of St. Malo). Over the Airy ellipsoid a straight line grid, the National Grid, is placed with a new <b>false</b> <b>origin</b> to eliminate negative numbers, creating a 700 km by 1300 km grid. This <b>false</b> <b>origin</b> is located south-west of the Isles of Scilly. The distortion created between the OS grid and the projection is countered by a scale factor in the longitude to create two lines of longitude with zero distortion rather than one. Grid north and true north are only aligned on the 400 km easting of the grid which is 2° W (OSGB36) and approx. 2° 0′ 5″ W (WGS 84).|$|E
5000|$|The {{system was}} chosen by the Survey Department of the Government of Palestine in 1922. [...] The {{projection}} used was the Cassini-Soldner projection. The central meridian (the line of longitude along {{which there is no}} local distortion) was chosen as that passing through a marker on the hill of Mar Elias Monastery south of Jerusalem. [...] The <b>false</b> <b>origin</b> (zero point) of the grid was placed 100 km to the south and west of the Ali el-Muntar hill that overlooks Gaza city. [...] The unit length for the grid was the kilometre; the British units were not even considered.|$|E
5000|$|The {{extent of}} the grid is 300 km {{to the east and}} 400 km {{to the west of the}} central {{meridian}} and 1300 km north from the <b>false</b> <b>origin,</b> (OSGB Section 7.1), but with the exclusion of parts of Northern Ireland, Eire and France. A grid reference is denoted by the pair (E,N) where E ranges from slightly over zero to 800000m and N ranges from zero to 1300000m. To reduce the number of figures needed to give a grid reference, the grid is divided into 100 km squares, which each have a two-letter code. National Grid positions can be given with this code followed by an easting and a northing both in the range 0 and 99999m.|$|E
40|$|The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a {{fundamental}} building block of the Internet infrastructure. However, due to the implicit trust assumption among networks, Internet routing remains quite vulnerable to various types of misconfiguration and attacks. Prefix hijacking is one such misbehavior where an attacker AS injects false routes to the Internet routing system that misleads victim’s traffic to the attacker AS. Previous secure routing proposals, e. g., S-BGP, have relied on the global public key infrastructure (PKI), which creates deployment burdens. In this paper, we propose an efficient cryptographic mechanism, HC-BGP, using hash chains and regular public/private key pairs to ensure prefix ownership certificates. HC-BGP is computationally more efficient than previously proposed secure routing scheme, {{and it is also}} more flexible for supporting various traffic engineering goals. Our scheme can efficiently prevent common prefix hijacking attacks which announce routes with <b>false</b> <b>origins,</b> including both prefix and sub-prefix hijacking attacks...|$|R

[...] There are three types of propaganda which differ depending upon their attribution. White propaganda reveals its origin and generally classified as overt. Covert propaganda includes grey propaganda in which the source is not revealed and black propaganda in which a <b>false</b> <b>origin</b> is claimed (the episode at the 1984 Olympics described below {{is an example of}} [...] "black propaganda"). In the later two types of propaganda the message's origin is concealed in some way. Often the credibility of a propaganda message depends on masking the true origin of the message to ensure the audience accepts it as an unbiased communication. Often propagandists will create a persona that is [...] "reliable, trustworthy and credible" [...] to the target audience which increases the likelihood that the message is believed and influences the audience's actions and perspectives. When counterpropaganda reveals the propaganda's true origin the target audience quickly loses faith in the message as the propagandist was caught lying.|$|E

Deadpool personally {{appears in the}} episode [...] "Ultimate Deadpool", voiced by Will Friedle. This version was a former S.H.I.E.L.D. trainee before dropping {{out to be a}} mercenary. Despite (and because of) Spider-Man's growing dislike for Deadpool's antics, attitude and willingness to kill (or as Deadpool puts it, [...] "un-alive"/"K-word"), they both end up fighting Taskmaster and each other for critical S.H.I.E.L.D. data about the secret identities of America's superheroes. He is shown capable of negating Taskmaster's ability to copy someone's fighting style, utilizing an unpredictable fighting style that parodies various dance moves, rendering Taskmaster's ability to predict attacks useless. After giving a few <b>false</b> <b>origin</b> stories (as well as mocking Wolverine), Deadpool finally reveals that he had been a street kid taken in by Nick Fury to be a hero, though he later decided being a mercenary was easier than carrying morals and a conscience. Ultimately, Spider-Man acknowledges that the web-slinger himself could have turned out like Deadpool had circumstances in his own life been different.|$|E

This paper presents a protocol enhancement to BGP which enables BGP to detect bogus route announcements from <b>false</b> <b>origins.</b> Rather than imposing cryptographybased authentication and encryption to secure routing message exchanges, our solution makes use of the rich connectivity among ASes that exists in the Internet. Simulation results show that this simple solution can effectively detect false routing announcements even in the presence of multiple compromised routers, become more robust in larger topologies, and can substantially reduce the impact of false routing announcements even with a partial deployment. ...|$|R
