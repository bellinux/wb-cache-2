To {{investigate}} {{the validity of}} steel slag as aggregates in road <b>surface</b> <b>dressing,</b> {{a series of tests}} for asphalt concrete mixed with asphalt cement and steel slag aggregates particles are performed using Marshall method. Through the statistical analysis of the test data, and comparison the data with those of asphalt macadam mixture, the asphalt concrete mixed with asphalt cement and steel slag aggregates have very large stiffness, high resistance to deformation and high resistance to cracking. If meeting the requirements of the code in china for asphalt macadam mixture, steel slag can be applied in road <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> instead of stone aggregates, but also bring remarkable economic effect and has broad application prospect...|$|R

40|$|Reactive plasma {{interactions}} with hydrocarbon-based surfaces {{play a critical}} role in future biological-plasma applications and for microelectronic device manufacture. As device dimensions get smaller and we require fine control of surfaces during plasma processing we will need to develop more understanding of fundamental plasma surface interactions. Through the use of plasma-deposited amorphous carbon films interacting inert/reactive plasmas (Ar/H 2 plasmas) we explored etch rates and the formation of modified layers. Facing Ar and H 2 plasmas mixtures, <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surfaces</b> can exhibit widely different properties, depending on plasma composition (ions, reactive species, fast neutrals) and initial film composition (graphitic, polymeric). Ar plasmas cause densification of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surface</b> by selectively sputtering H atoms, while H 2 plasmas cause incorporation/saturation of H atoms within the film surface. For hard amorphous carbon, we find that small amounts of H 2 added to Ar plasma can completely negate ion-induced densification. Plasmas are also drastically changed by small impurities of H 2 atoms. We investigated the plasma property effects of adding H 2, D 2, CH 4, and surface derive...|$|R

Bacteria apparently lacking a glycocalyx were also found closely associated with the surface of the hydrophobic substrate and in channels within the substrate. A solvent precipitation and column chromatographic fractionation of the bitumen was followed by cross-tests for growth on the fractions by various isolated sediment microorganisms, as determined by epifluorescence count.

40|$|Surface {{dressings}} {{are used}} as a road maintenance activity {{as well as a}} surfacing of a newly constructed road. One of the main decisions to be taken in designing a dressing is the selection of appropriate aggregate size. Improper selection of aggregate size could tarnish the performance of a <b>surface</b> <b>dressing.</b> The aim {{of this study is to}} find the optimum size of aggregate for a single <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> especially in Sri Lankan Macadam roads. General size of aggregate for a particular <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> could be found using commercial traffic volume and surface hardness of the road based on TRRL method. But the aggregate sizes selected in above simple method have shown inconsistent results. Therefore tests should be carried out to find most appropriate size for the surface dressings. Three sizes of aggregate were selected using above simple check for the tests. Three different surface dressings from different aggregate sizes were done. Binder type kept constant and binder rate changed according to the chip size. The performances of these three surface dressings were evaluated by measuring aggregate removal rate and skid resistance of the seal. Digital photographs of demarcated locations in surface dressings of different chip sizes were taken at pre determined time intervals. The numbers of aggregate were counted in each photo after certain time interval and using this data, the behavior of each <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> over a period of time can be studied. The aggregate size that could keep highest area of aggregate intact in its dressing would be a more durable chip size. The next aspect of checking performance of the dressing is the skid resistance. The techniques utilized to measure this value are Locked wheel test and Sand patch method. The main- aim of skid resistance testing was to compare three sizes of aggregate and see how they respond to skidding. -It was found that 9. 5 mm nominal size performed better in durability aspect and 12. 5 mm performed better in skid resistance aspect...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the monitoring {{and the experience}} of two full scale trials with <b>surface</b> <b>dressing.</b> In one of them modified emulsion was tested on the primary road 84 between Kasteln-Laforsen in the county Hälsingland in the north of Sweden. The test sections were produced during year 2001. A second full scale trial test was carried through during year 2004 with the purpose to optimise the utilizing of the stone aggregate (chippings) with different types of fractions 4 - 8, 4 - 16 and 8 - 16 mm. This trial was carried through on the secondary road 723 between Heden and Färila also in the county Hälsingland. In addition to testing different types of binders, the effect of breaking additive was studied in the respects of how soon the <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> could be swept from excess of loose stones after the surface treatment was carried out and the time of the year the surface treatment was carried out. The test sections have been monitored with respect to macro texture, rut depth, longitudinal evenness and noise emission as well as by visual inspections of damages and defects. In addition to this the laboratory testing of the wear resistance and the testing of the sensibility to the effect of water have been carried out. For this purpose a modified laboratory test method (Prall method), for <b>surface</b> <b>dressing,</b> has been used. During the production phase of the <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> some advantages were noticed by the use of polymer modified bitumen emulsion {{with the addition of a}} breaking additive. In principle the method is to inject the breaking additive into the emulsion just before spreading of the bituminous emulsion on the road. The stone aggregate was fixed to the road surface after a relatively short time which made it possible to sweep the surface treatment from the excess of loose stones after a few hours after the production of the surface treatment. Modified bitumen emulsion combined with the breaking additive showed consequently positive effects for the road users through better accessibility and a less risk of loose stones damaging the vehicles...|$|R

500|$|The use of dressed stone {{rather than}} gravel as a <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> was also {{occasionally}} {{held to be}} a sign against the causeway being of Roman construction: the majority of Roman roads that were finished with a material other than simple packed earth were dressed in either packed gravel or pebbles. There are other examples of Roman roads paved with stone blocks, including the [...] section of the Via Appia—the oldest major Roman route in Italy—near Albano. Historians Richard A Gabriel and Michael Grant state that of the [...] of known Roman roads, over [...] may have been stone-paved. The Roman writer Ulpian specifically differentiates between via munita, which always had a paved stone surface, and via glareata, which were earthed roads with either gravelled surfaces, or a gravelled subsurface and paving on top. The causeway may well have had a gravel <b>surface</b> <b>dressing</b> originally, which has been removed since through robbing and natural weathering. Another difference in construction detail between Wade's Causeway and a typical Roman road is its lack of a foundation of large stones.

40|$|The {{affinity}} of microbial {{cells for}} hydrophobic interfaces {{is important because}} it directly affects the efficiency of various bioprocesses, including green biotechnologies. The toluene-degrading bacterium Acinetobacter sp. strain Tol 5 has filamentous appendages and a hydrophobic cell surface, shows high adhesiveness to solid surfaces, and self-agglutinates. A “bald” mutant of this bacterium, strain T 1, lacks the filamentous appendages and has decreased adhesiveness but retains a hydrophobic cell surface. We investigated the interaction between T 1 cells and an organic solvent dispersed in an aqueous matrix. During a microbial-adhesion-to-hydrocarbon (MATH) test, which is frequently used to measure cell surface hydrophobicity, T 1 cells adhered to hexadecane droplet surfaces in a monolayer, whereas wild-type cells aggregated on the droplet surfaces. The adsorbed T 1 cells on the hexadecane surfaces hindered the coalescence of the droplets formed by vortexing, stabilizing the emulsion phase. Following the replacement of the aqueous phase with fresh pure water after the MATH test, a proportion of the T 1 cells that had adsorbed to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surface</b> detached during further vortexing, suggesting a reversible adsorption of T 1 cells. The final ratio of the adhering cells to the total cells in the detachment test coincided with that in the MATH test. The adhesion of T 1 cells to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surface</b> conformed to the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which describes reversible monolayer adsorption. Reversible monolayer adsorption should be useful for green technologies employing two-liquid-phase partitioning systems and for bioremediation because it allows effective reaction and transport of hydrophobic substrates at oil-water interfaces...|$|R

These studies suggest that the strength of the binding of the metal to the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surface</b> is controlled by the electronic demands of both the metal (16 -electron configuration) and ligand (maximum retention of aromaticity). In cases where these two factors can be satisfied simultaneously an energetically isolated equilibrium structure emerges and haptotropic shifts are blocked.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a body of}} work aimed at increasing the current understanding of the dynamics of collisions at the gas-liquid and related interfaces. In particular, collisions of open-shell radicals (oxygen atoms in the electronic ground state and hydroxyl radicals) with <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surfaces</b> have been investigated. Translationally hot radicals were scattered from liquid <b>hydrocarbons</b> and related <b>surfaces.</b> The products of inelastic scattering and hydrogen abstraction reactions (OH radicals) were detected, with translational and internal-state resolution, by laser-induced fluorescence (LIF). The radicals were used as a ‘chemical probe’ of the interface, providing unique information on the structure and reactivity of the surface, and how this relates to the bulk composition. Key results include the establishment of the relative reactivity towards oxygen atoms of liquid hydrocarbons and alkylthiol SAMs and the penetration depth of O atoms into the SAM surfaces. This was achieved through systematic studies involving custom-synthesised site-selectively deuterated SAMs. It was found that hydrogen abstraction can occur deeper within the monolayer than previously believed but still emerge as OH (or OD) without reacting further to form water. The reactivity of O(3 P) atoms towards a technologically important family of ionic liquids ([Cnmim][Im]) was measured. It was found that the reactivity increased non-linearly as a function of alkyl chain length, to an extent which far exceeded any anticipated increase in reactivity based on stoichiometry alone. The interface in this case was found to differ greatly from the bulk composition, with preferential occupation by the alkyl units at the surface. The energy transfer and reactive uptake of OH radicals at a variety of <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surfaces</b> was investigated. There was significant transfer of the initial translational energy to all the surfaces as well as substantial translational-to-rotational energy conversion. This energy conversion was dependent on the functional groups present in the liquids as was the reactive uptake of OH. Reactive uptake coefficients (γ) were obtained for alkane, alkene and carboxylic acid-containing organic liquids. The results are discussed in terms of the relevance to the aging of organic particles in the troposphere...|$|R

40|$|Understanding mass {{transport}} mechanics, or how each hydrocarbon group migrates from the reservoir formation to the surface, {{is essential for}} integrating near-surface hydrocarbon data with seismic survey data, subsurface geological information, and geomorphological data Migration Mechanisms: Work on vertical migration mechanisms {{during the past decade}} has increased our understanding of how hydrocarbons may be transported from petroleum reservoirs to the surface. While current vertical migration models deal with low-molecular-weight hydrocarbons migrating as gases (Arp, 1992) (Klusman and Saeed, 1996), medium to heavy weight petroleum hydrocarbons also are present at the surface (Hebert, 1988) (Brooks, et al, 1986) (Brooks and Kennicutt, 1988). Some heavier hydrocarbons are not sufficiently volatile for significant quantities to be transported as a gas phase 1. In addition, comparing Figures 1 and 2 shows one offshore example where light <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surface</b> expressions were quite different from heavy <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>surface</b> expressions (Belt and Rice, 1996 a, 1996 b). Different surface patterns suggest light and heavy hydrocarbons possibly migrate to the surface through different pathways. One explanation for migration through different pathways is different migration phases. The “other phase ” occurring in vertical migration may be liquid. Certainly, liquid hydrocarbon seeps have been documented offshore (Kennicutt, et al, 1988) and less frequently, on land. Possibly, less-than-visible quantities of heavy hydrocarbons migrate to the surface by similar vertical migration mechanisms. This paper addresses preliminary results of on-going 1 A phase refers to a pure material or a single homogeneous mixture of materials.
