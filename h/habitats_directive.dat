40|$|The {{implementation}} of the EU Bird and <b>Habitat</b> <b>Directives</b> by the ports and dredging industry caused severe project disruptions across North-West Europe in the past. The prevalence of negative experience triggered a new approach, which aims to integrate site-specific ecosystem characteristics and project objectives during {{the development of the}} initial project design. This approach is termed ‘Building with Nature’. The authorities and practitioners hope that the new approach will improve project implementation within the existing framework of the Bird and <b>Habitat</b> <b>Directives.</b> In this paper we review a total of twelve projects in the field of dredging against the definition of ‘Building with Nature’. For each project we highlight the outcome of assessment according to article 6 of the EU <b>Habitat</b> <b>Directive.</b> In conclusion we assess if there is a connection between the application of Building with Nature and the outcome of assessment under article 6 <b>Habitat</b> <b>Directive...</b>|$|R

Possibly the construction, exploitation and dismantlement of the wind farms will influence fish in the North Sea, which are protected under the European <b>Habitat</b> <b>Directive</b> or are considered as prey for other <b>Habitat</b> <b>Directive</b> species such as marine mammals. Deltares will use this study as input for the generic ‘Appropriate Assessment’ (environmental impact study) for the building of offshore wind farms, {{as required by the}} <b>Habitat</b> <b>Directive.</b> In this study we have provided an overview of relevant information for a number of important fish species in the North Sea in relation to coastal Natura 2000 areas and future wind farms...|$|R
5|$|The valley {{also has}} {{a wide variety of}} small mammals with larger species {{including}} Eurasian badger (Meles meles) and deer (Cervidae). The valley is home to fifteen of the sixteen bats found in England including a roost, at Compton Martin Ochre Mine, for greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in Annex II of the 1992 European Community <b>Habitats</b> <b>Directive.</b>|$|E
5|$|The site is {{characterized}} by a mosaic of 17 plant communities regrouped into three main types of ecological units: grassy open areas, shrubby areas and wooded areas. Of these, three are listed in the <b>Habitats</b> <b>Directive.</b> The calcareous rocky slopes with chasmophytic vegetation Cystopterido fragilis-Asplenietum scolopendrii are considered as exceptional, with a degree of uncertainty in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region. Hydrophilous tall herb fringe community with Petasites hybridus, at the limit of its range, is also exceptional. The herbaceous fringe with red campion (Silene dioica) et wood forget-me-not (Myosotis sylvatica) (Sileno dioicae - Myosotidetum sylvaticae) is very rare in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais. The wood-fringe Lathyro sylvestris – Astragaletum glycyphylli is also regionally interesting.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{important}} small mammals {{are found in}} the area, including the hazel dormouse (Muscardinus avellanarius) and bats. The hazel dormouse is restricted largely to coppice woodland and scrub, while the bats, including the nationally rare lesser (Rhinolophus hipposideros) and greater horseshoe bats (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum), have a number of colonies in buildings, caves, and mines in the area. A rare and endangered species, the greater horseshoe bat is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed in AnnexII of the 1992 European Community <b>Habitats</b> <b>Directive.</b> Amphibians such as the great crested newt (Triturus cristatus) have a wide distribution across the Mendips and are often found in flooded disused quarries.|$|E

40|$|The {{implementation}} of the Birds and <b>Habitats</b> <b>directives</b> has been problematic in many member states of the EU. In the Netherlands, many decision-making processes have ended in judicial intervention. This paper analyses the problematic {{implementation of}} both directives in the Netherlands. It shows that nature conservation legislation has gained importance in decision-making processes, but that this does not automatically mean that nature conservation goals have been achieved. Because of the emphasis that {{is placed on the}} procedural aspects of decision making, the costs involved have increased, while the substantial goals of the European Birds and <b>Habitats</b> <b>directives</b> are fading into the background. ...|$|R

The SBA Environment Department, assisted by a large volunteer effort, has monitored turtle nesting success on SBA beaches since 1990. Disturbance to nesting turtles is an issue in some areas due to activities such as camping, driving on beaches and illegal fishing.

25|$|The {{perception}} of bay salt marshes as a coastal 'wasteland' has since changed, acknowledging {{that they are}} one of the most biologically productive habitats on earth, rivalling tropical rainforests. Salt marshes are ecologically important providing habitats for native migratory fish and acting as sheltered feeding and nursery grounds. They are now protected by legislation in many countries to look after these ecologically important habitats. In the United States and Europe, they are now accorded to a high level of protection by the Clean Water Act and the <b>Habitats</b> <b>Directive</b> respectively. With the impacts of this habitat and its importance now realised, a growing interest in restoring salt marshes, through managed retreat or the reclamation of land has been established. However, many Asian countries such as China are still to recognise the value of marshlands. With their ever-growing populations and intense development along the coast, the value of salt marshes tends to be ignored and the land continues to be reclaimed.|$|E
