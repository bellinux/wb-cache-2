40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} evaluating {{the impact of the}} Learning Centre on student learning and satisfaction at a regional university with a significant online presence. The <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> are the aspiration and challenges in creating a database to begin a formal self-evaluation process to help determine the benefits that student learning support programs have on student learning accomplishments in academic programs. An argument is made for how to evaluate a mature student learning support program in an era of change and high accountability expectations and how this framework will shape the creation and use of a database using existing data heretofore not collected, with potential capacity for linkages to other campus student record databases. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{inequity}} {{issues and}} evidence are the <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article.</b> The study reanalized {{data collected from}} 60 primary schools {{in the city of}} Malang. Three upper grades in each school were picked up, 160 classes with all 5188 pupils. The prior attainment of Indonesian Language and Mathematics expressing the basic skills were used as predictor baselines. The post-scores after a year in progress, were treated as response variables. The learning progress revealed by the value-added of each child was obtained after taking into account the baselines and regressing to the response variables utilising the multilevel analyses. Issues of inequity were raised related to significant factors differentiating pupil attainment progress and the possible gap in school leve...|$|R

25|$|Under {{the later}} kings of the Persian Empire, the Cappadocians {{were divided into}} two satrapies, or governments, with one {{comprising}} the central and inland portion, to which the name of Cappadocia continued to be applied by Greek geographers, while the other was called Pontus. This division had already come about before the time of Xenophon.

40|$|Social {{support is}} a broad term, which {{includes}} the supportive ways that different people behave in the social environment. Structural measures of the environment deal with the mere existence of social relationships.

40|$|The <b>foci</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> are {{the actors}} and {{entities}} {{that are responsible for}} the development of master planned residential estates. Master planning represents a comprehensive, integrated approach to new suburban developments whereby a private property developer - sometimes in coalition with government partners - plans and develops a new suburb that incorporates extensive landscaping and design, commercial, recreational, and social services, and attempts to foster a sense of community among local residents. Such visions are not new but have their roots in the utopian ideals of the Garden City movement of the nineteenth century. Since then, master plan developers have drawn on the garden city vision, albeit with varying degrees of commitment to its social and political ambitions. Today, master plan developers tend to be large commercial entities which market and sell the master planned experience as part of an overall corporate brand, offering lifestyle, leisure, and community in a highly aestheticised landscape. Concerned with protecting the value of their investment, master plan developers often stay involved in the governing of new estates for several decades, which can lead to difficult relations with local residents. © 2012 Copyrigh...|$|R

40|$|Knowledge culture” {{is part of}} Islam. Since {{the life}} of the Prophet Muhammad (pbuh), this culture has been given a {{priority}} through the implementation of the “concept of iqra’. Correct understanding <b>of</b> <b>this</b> concept in the Muslim community has contributed to the formation of the “Islamic Civilization”. The emergence <b>of</b> <b>this</b> civilization is partly due to the management of knowledge itself. An analysis of the history of Islamic knowledge has shown that the Muslim community gave priority to knowledge management. The development of institutions of higher learning, known as madrasah, such as ‘Madrasah Nizamiah’, the building of complete educational infrastructure, the translation works, the publication of many outstanding books such as ‘Ihya’ Ulumuddin’ by Imam Al-Ghazali, the commitment of the government to develop a system of learning {{and at the same time}} the active participation of government leaders and the Muslim intellectuals in academic discourses are some indicators of knowledge management. In line with that statement, this paper attempts to explore the issue of knowledge management from an Islamic perspective and its relationship with da’wah.
