Of players born outside the United States on 2006 Major League Opening Day rosters, the Dominican Republic (85) and Venezuela (43) had more than all other {{countries}} and between them accounted for more than 57% of foreign-born players in the leagues. Italy is among the top nations in Europe and had access to Italian-American players under the <b>eligibility</b> <b>rules</b> for the tournament.

Players who represented France prior to Laporte's announcement remain eligible for selection even if they do not hold French passports.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to determine if National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division III needs an initial <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule.</b> Subjects were 14 athletic directors from two NCAA Division III athletic conferences. Data were analyzed and the results were reported in frequencies and percentages. The percentages were shown in the following areas: university and athletic director demographics; eligibility rules; and athletic directors experience and their opinion on an <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule.</b> The athletic directors showed favor towards an initial <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> by just a slight margin of 57 %, although the reasoning for supporting and disagreeing with it was varied. Previous research pertaining only to Division III had not been produced prior to this study. Suggestions include a push toward a Division III initial <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> but institutions still need freedom to admit students of all academic levels and those with learning disabilities. The research does not intend to speak for all Division III institutions, but simply to make athletic directors as well as the NCAA aware of the need for initial eligibility.

40|$|Many {{professional}} sports associations have {{a rule that}} a member may not participate in a tournament, game, or contest sanctioned or sponsored by a rival association or promoter. If a member athlete does compete in a contest {{in violation of the}} rule, the association may remove the offending athlete from the membership list with a consequent loss of eligibility to compete in association-sponsored competition. The purposes of such an <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> are to suppress competition from rival leagues and to retain exclusive rights to the member athletes 2 ̆ 7 performances. Such an arrangement may be viewed as an attempt to coerce or harm a competing association by restricting an intermediate third party, a member athlete.

5|$|To {{improve his}} {{academic}} profile, Moore planned to attend American Christian School in Aston, Pennsylvania, {{but a new}} NCAA rule was instituted that limited the number of core classes able to be taken at a prep school. Lacking the required number of credits to receive an athletic scholarship, he enrolled at Temple as a non-scholarship student and sat out his freshman year as a redshirt. In his freshman debut the following year, he scored 11points against East Tennessee State. Moore followed that performance up with a double-double of 11points and 10rebounds versus the College of Charleston, and a season-high 13points in a loss to Clemson. As a freshman, Moore averaged 4.5points and 2.3rebounds per game in 13.2minutes of playing time.

He made his second appearance the following year, coming on as a late substitute for Thomas Müller in a 3–1 UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying win over Azerbaijan.

Young and Curie were both in the Marist Class 4A sectional in the 2014 IHSA playoffs and could have met again in the round of sixteen on March 14 if they had both won three regional contests. Despite forfeiting all wins in CPL games, Curie remained eligible to compete in the IHSA playoffs due to differences in <b>eligibility</b> <b>rules.</b> On March 4, Curie lost their opening IHSA playoff game to 11–11 DuSable High School by an 88–85 margin in overtime. It marked Curies first loss of the season on the court with Alexander in the lineup. Alexander posted 25 points, 15 rebounds, and 8 blocks despite fouling out in the final minute of regulation time.

50|$|In basketball, Olympic Council of Asia's <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> on {{naturalized}} players, which contradicted the <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> set by FIBA, became controversial as such rule disqualified Quincy Davis, a US-born player {{playing for}} the Chinese Taipei team, and Andray Blatche, a naturalized player of the Philippines, from participating in the tournament. In accordance with the rule, OCA also refused South Korea's request to include Aaron Haynes in the squad, an American veteran player in Korea's basketball league {{who was in the}} process of naturalization. Both OCA officials and IAGOC claimed that the OCA's <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> requires a naturalized player to live minimum of three years in the country of his naturalization before becoming eligible to play for that country. Nevertheless, Chinese Taipei Basketball Association stated that it received the positive confirmation from OCA regarding the participation of Quincy Davis, which was suddenly overturned due to the fact that Davis was two months short from residing three full years in Chinese Taipei. Some basketball fans argued that the host nation South Korea brought up the regulation rule at the last minute in order to not allow enough time for its major opponents to reconstruct their squads. Meanwhile, others said that South Korea was just enforcing the OCA's regulation and the South Korean team themselves were also negatively affected by the rule. Despite the request of FIBA to reconsider the enforcement of the <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule,</b> both OCA and the organizing committee upheld their decision.|$|R

5|$|When the MCC {{abolished}} amateur {{status in}} cricket in 1963, making all cricketers paid professionals, Allen opposed the change. In 1963, {{he was appointed}} as MCC President. When his one-year term of office ended in late 1964, he {{was appointed to the}} influential role of MCC Treasurer, a position he filled until 1976. During this period, Allen instituted several reforms, including limiting the terms of office of key positions. He streamlined the MCC administration and recruited new people to key positions. Less successfully, he opposed the relaxation of <b>eligibility</b> <b>rules</b> for the County Championship to allow overseas players from 1968. He was heavily involved in a change in the relationship between the MCC and English cricket in 1968. The newly formed Sports Council required that, to receive financial support from the government, cricket be more democratically organised and not run by a private members' club. Allen and S. C. Griffith, the MCC secretary, liaised with the Minister of Sport to set up a new Cricket Council, comprising representatives from the MCC, the new Test and County Cricket Board and the National Cricket Association. This move significantly reduced the influence of the MCC, and at Allen's suggestion, the club's influence within the Cricket Council was further reduced in 1974.|$|E

When taken together, the two rules create two different tracks—one for men and one for women—to be negotiated on route to a professional basketball career in the United States. This sort of dualtracking, in which one route presents advantages over the other, is unacceptable in a nation committed to gender equity, and it therefore requires Title VII scrutiny. Although parent companies often are not held liable for their subsidiaries’ acts, both the integrated enterprise doctrine and the direct liability participation doctrine suggest the NBA could be held liable for the discrimination that flows from the divergent policies. And, therefore, whether the NBA is determined under Title VII analysis to be a third party employer or an employment agency, an aggrieved woman basketball player who is ruled ineligible under the WNBA’s age <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule</b> but who would be eligible, were she a man, under the NBA’s age <b>eligibility</b> <b>rule,</b> will have a potentially viable claim.
