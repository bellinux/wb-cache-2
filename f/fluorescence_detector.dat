40|$|Gamma Ray Bursts {{are being}} searched in many ground based {{experiments}} detecting the high energy component (GeV ÷ TeV energy range) of the photon bursts. In this paper, <b>Fluorescence</b> <b>Detectors</b> are considered as possible candidate devices for these searches. It is {{shown that the}} GRB photons induce fluorescence emission of UV photons {{on a wide range}} of their spectrum. The induced fluorescence flux is dominated by GRB photons from 0. 1 to about 100 MeV and, once the extinction through the atmosphere is taken into account, it is distributed over a wide angular region. This flux can be detected through a monitor of the diffuse photon flux, provided that its maximum value exceeds a threshold value, that is primarily determined by the sky brightness above the detector. The feasibility of this search and the expected rates are discussed on the basis of the current GRB observations and the existing <b>fluorescence</b> <b>detectors.</b> Key words: Gamma Ray Bursts, GRB, Fluorescence...|$|R

50|$|The {{integrated}} nanoliter system {{consists of}} microfabricated fluidic channels, heaters, temperature sensors, and fluorescence detectors. The microfabricated fluidic channels (basically very small pipes) {{act as the}} main transportation structures for any fluids as well as where reactions occur within the system. For the desired reactions to occur, the temperature needs to be adjusted. Therefore, heaters are attached to some microfabricated fluidic channels. To monitor and maintain the desired temperature, temperature sensors are crucial for successful and desired reactions. In order to accurately track the fluids before and after a reaction, fluorescence detectors are used for detecting {{the movements of the}} fluids within the system. For instance, when a specific fluid passes a certain point where it triggers or excites emission of light, the <b>fluorescence</b> <b>detector</b> is able to receive that emission and calculate {{the time it takes to}} reach that certain point.|$|E
