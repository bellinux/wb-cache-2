50|$|In 1983, Beth Herr lost an <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> Billie Jean King at Wimbledon 8-6 in the 3rd. Commentators on HBO Breakfast at Wimbledon made a {{very big}} deal out of her ability to hit {{numerous}} swinging volleys out of the air for winners. This was something that had not been done before especially by a female.|$|R
50|$|In February, Karlović {{reached the}} final of the U.S. National Indoor Tennis Championships, losing to Kei Nishikori. In May, he reached {{the final of}} the Düsseldorf Open, losing to Philipp Kohlschreiber. In July, he reached {{the final of the}} Hall of Fame Tennis Championships, losing an <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> Lleyton Hewitt. Another solid week of tennis saw him make it back to back finals, this time at the Claro Open Colombia, losing to Bernard Tomic in a tight three-setter. He avenged that loss the {{following}} month at the Rogers Cup in another tight three-setter.|$|R
25|$|The {{first major}} open tournament was the 1968 French Open, when Gonzales {{had just turned}} 40. In {{spite of the fact}} that he had been semi-retired for a number of years and that the tournament was held on slow clay courts that penalize serve-and-volley players, Gonzales beat the 1967 {{defending}} champion Roy Emerson in the quarterfinals. He then lost in the semifinals to Rod Laver. He lost in the third round of 1968 Wimbledon but later beat the second-seeded Tony Roche in the fourth round of the 1968 US Open, before losing an <b>epic</b> <b>match</b> <b>to</b> the Netherlands' Tom Okker.|$|R
50|$|Bernard Francis Bergin (20 September 1913 in Dublin - 17 June 1985 in Dublin) was an Irish cricketer. A {{right-handed}} batsman, {{he played}} twice for Ireland against New Zealand in September 1937. One of those matches had first-class status, and was notable for {{being one of}} the few first-class <b>matches</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> and end on the same day.|$|R
60|$|Kennedy had {{expected}} to find his missing men huddled in a semicircle round the fire, waiting for some one to come {{and tell them that}} Blackburn's had taken the field, and that they could come out now without any fear of having to wait in the rain for the <b>match</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> This, he thought, would have been the unselfish policy of Kay's senior dayroom.|$|R
50|$|A little under a {{month since}} their dismal exit from Euro 2016, the FA {{appointed}} Sunderland manager Sam Allardyce {{as the new}} manager of the national side. Allardyce opted to forego a friendly <b>match</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> his reign, so his first match in charge was the opening match of England's 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying campaign away in Slovakia, for which England had been drawn in the same group as rivals Scotland. England labored to a 1-0 win in Trnava, with Adam Lallana scoring in stoppage time.|$|R
50|$|During the quarter-finals, Christie is {{paired with}} Nina Williams. But before the fight, Jin notices Nina's face, {{she was one}} of the assassins. After Christie defeats Nina, Jin is matched up with an elite swordsman named Yoshimitsu. Heihachi, liking this young fighter, deems that this match be {{reserved}} for the semi-finals and attempts to change the order, but Kazuya, who controls the Jackhammers, stops him. Kazuya then has Heihachi imprisoned and orders the <b>match</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin,</b> effectively seizing control of Tekken. Jin narrowly kills Yoshimitsu, thanks to Heihachi tripping a security alert in the arena.|$|R

On May 11, 2015, King lost the X Division Championship against Spud. On June 24, 2015, (aired July 1) Beat Down Clan {{defeated}} The Rising in a 4-on-3 Handicap match, forcing The Rising to dissolve. Also, Hernandez made {{his return to}} TNA, joining BDC in the progress. The Beat Down Clan was quickly dissolved after contract disputes with Hernandez and MVP and King was taken off television.|$|R
50|$|Shaw started every league <b>match</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the 2015-16 season ranging until mid-September 2015. On 15 September 2015, {{during the}} opening match of the Champions League group stage against PSV, Shaw was caught by Héctor Moreno with a slide tackle and {{suffered}} a double leg fracture. Shaw was given oxygen and treated by nine medical staff during the nine-minute stoppage in Eindhoven before he was taken off on a stretcher and taken to hospital. Shaw {{was expected to be}} out of action for at least six months. He returned to training on 4 April 2016.|$|R

50|$|In the 1962-63 season Saints fielded {{the same}} line-up in 28 matches {{including}} all seven FA Cup matches as Saints progressed to the semi-final, going out 1-0 at Villa Park to eventual winners Manchester United, after an <b>epic</b> three <b>match</b> battle <b>to</b> get past Nottingham Forest {{in the previous}} round. In the first quarter-final replay against Forest, Burnside scored an 89th-minute equaliser as Saints {{came back from a}} three-goal deficit. In the second replay, at White Hart Lane he scored twice, including a rocket shot for the third goal as Saints finally defeated Forest 5-0.|$|R
50|$|Carter has {{at times}} {{missed out on}} {{opportunities}} from winning positions, an extreme example being {{in the first round}} of the 2007 UK Championship, when Carter led Barry Hawkins 8-3 before Hawkins won the next six frames to win 9-8. However, Carter got his own back on Hawkins during the 2008 World Championship by beating him 10-9 in a 'controversial' finale. Hawkins had levelled the <b>match</b> <b>to</b> 9-9, when the players were pulled out of the arena to allow the evening <b>matches</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin.</b> They returned after one of the evening's two matches had been completed - on a table they had not previously played on. Hawkins felt this break interrupted his momentum, handing the <b>match</b> <b>to</b> Carter. He followed this by defeating two former champions in succession; provisional World Number 1 Shaun Murphy 13-4 in the second round and then 2002 winner Peter Ebdon 13-9 in the quarter-final. In the semi-final on 4 May 2008 he beat Joe Perry 17-15 to book a place against Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final. Carter lost the final 18-8.|$|R

Seedings {{were based on the}} UEFA national team coefficient ranking. Albania was drawn in Group D along with France, Romania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus, and Luxembourg.|$|R
5000|$|Round 2, {{otherwise}} known as the Xtreme Round, utilized a hybrid of dry, desert-like terrain, and longer distance shots on city park grass. The resulting transition allowed for a second <b>match</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> once the first match was past a certain point. This type of design was encouraged to continue in future years, as the Xtreme Round is known to take the longest. At the conclusion of Round 2, Julie Holt and Param Chauhan were tied in score at [...]533 (due <b>to</b> unbalanced <b>match</b> participants, players scores are calculated based on how many opponents they bested in their heats). A playoff was held prior to the final, consisting of 1 wicket and a stake. Julie won the coin toss, made the first wicket, but missed the stake. Param's shot bounced off the wicket, leading Julie to stake out and punch her ticket into the Final.|$|R
2500|$|As the <b>match</b> {{is ready}} <b>to</b> <b>begin,</b> Annie and Frank's egos come out again with each {{claiming}} {{they are better}} than the other ("Anything You Can Do"). Sitting Bull convinces Annie to deliberately lose the <b>match</b> <b>to</b> Frank, reminding her that she [...] "can't get a man with a gun." [...] That done, Frank and Annie finally reconcile, deciding to marry and merge the shows.|$|R
50|$|Patti LaBelle {{embarked}} on a solo career in 1977, shortly after the split of the adventurous girl group Labelle. Her first solo album, a self-titled affair, was critically acclaimed and also found commercial success. However, her three follow-ups for <b>Epic,</b> failed <b>to</b> <b>match</b> that album's momentum, despite some charted singles. When her fourth album, Released, failed to generate a significant R&B or pop hit, she agreed to sign with Philadelphia International Records, which had been known to provide hits for veteran artists such as The O'Jays, Lou Rawls and Billy Paul.|$|R
50|$|On the April 6, 2012 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Sandow {{appeared}} in a pre-taped interview denouncing popular culture and extolling his virtues. After weeks of vignettes, Sandow made his WWE in-ring return under the new gimmick on the May 4 episode of SmackDown, but refused to compete against Derrick Bateman, claiming that the audience would neither learn nor benefit from him facing an inferior opponent. On the May 18 episode of SmackDown, Sandow refused to wrestle against Yoshi Tatsu, but Tatsu accused Sandow of being a coward and Sandow assaulted him. On the May 25 episode of SmackDown, Sandow defeated Tatsu in his debut match. The following week, he refused to face Ezekiel Jackson, and despite Jackson forcing the <b>match</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin,</b> Sandow won. On the June 8 episode of SmackDown, Sandow went to attack Hornswoggle but was intercepted by Tyson Kidd before he could do so. The following week on SmackDown, Sandow defeated Kidd.|$|R
50|$|The film {{begins with}} Huo Yuanjia {{fighting}} and defeating three Westerners: a British boxer, a Belgian lancer and a Spanish fencer. While {{waiting for the}} fourth <b>match</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin,</b> Huo remembers his father Huo Endi teaching martial arts. The story is then told in an extended flashback. Watching his father fight, the young Yuanjia wants to participate, but his father is concerned about his asthma. Yuanjia sees his father in a leitai match with Zhao, who won the fight dishonourably by retaliating when Huo Endi held back {{what would have been}} a fatal blow. Humiliated by his father's defeat, Huo Yuanjia vows to regain the Huo family's honour and pride. He practices martial arts behind his father's back. As the years pass, Huo Yuanjia defeats several opponents in leitai matches and becomes a famous martial artist in Tianjin. As he becomes successful, he becomes arrogant and ruthless towards his opponents, compared to his late father who advocated showing mercy to opponents.|$|R
50|$|In Essendon's round 16 {{win against}} Collingwood in 2005, defender Andrew Welsh {{was unable to}} take his place on the field.

25|$|Sturridge {{missed all}} of Chelsea's {{pre-season}} <b>matches</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> the 2012–13 campaign, {{as he was}} on duty with Great Britain in the 2012 Summer Olympics. He did, however, play against Manchester City in the 2012 FA Community Shield, assisting Ryan Bertrand's goal, by shooting and Costel Pantilimon spilling it. Sturridge missed the first 2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage matches against Juventus and Nordsjælland and the first League Cup match against Wolverhampton. He also missed the Premier League match against Stoke City with a hamstring injury. He scored the last Premier League goal for the club in the 4–2 win against Tottenham at White Hart Lane after coming on as a late substitute and scoring from Juan Mata's cross in stoppage time to seal victory. His last goal for Chelsea was against Manchester United in the League Cup, scoring in extra time in the 5–4 win. After Blues manager Roberto Di Matteo was sacked as manager and replaced by Rafael Benítez, Sturridge was never {{to play for the}} club again due to injury.|$|R

5000|$|A {{wrestling match}} may be {{declared}} a no contest if the winning conditions {{are unable to}} occur. This can be due to excessive interference, loss of referee's control over the match, one or more participants sustaining debilitating injury not caused by the opponent, or the inability of a scheduled <b>match</b> <b>to</b> even <b>begin.</b> A no contest is a state separate and distinct from a draw [...] - [...] a draw indicates winning conditions were met. Although the terms are sometimes used interchangeably in practice, this usage is technically incorrect.|$|R
50|$|In {{the later}} {{part of the}} Romantic tradition, in {{reaction}} to the spirit of the Enlightenment, folklorists collected folktales, epic poems, and ballads, and brought them out in printed form. The Brothers Grimm were inspired in their collection, Grimm's Fairy Tales, by the movement of German Romanticism. Many other collectors were inspired by the Grimms and the similar sentiments. Frequently their motives stemmed not merely from Romanticism, but from Romantic nationalism, in that many were inspired to save their own country's folklore: sometimes, as in the Kalevala, they compiled existing folklore into an <b>epic</b> <b>to</b> <b>match</b> other nation's; sometimes, as in Ossian, they fabricated folklore that should have been there. These works, whether fairy tale, ballads, or folk epics, were a major source for later fantasy works.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For planar graphs, {{counting}} {{the number of}} perfect matchings (and hence determining whether there exists a perfect matching) can be done in NC [4, 10]. For planar bipartite graphs, finding a perfect matching when one exists can also be done in NC [8, 7]. However in general planar graphs (when the bipartite condition is removed), no NC algorithm for constructing a perfect matching is known. We address a relaxation of this problem. We consider the fractional matching polytope P(G) of a planar graph G. Each vertex of this polytope is either a perfect matching, or a half-integral solution: an assignment of weights from the set { 0, 1 / 2, 1 } to each edge of G so that the weights of edges incident on each vertex of G add up to 1 [6]. We show that a vertex of this polytope can be found in NC, provided G has at least one perfect <b>matching</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> with. If, furthermore, the graph is bipartite, then all vertices are integral, and thus our procedure actually finds a perfect matching without explicitly exploiting the bipartiteness of G. ...|$|R

But at the 11th hour Junaid gets a clue of Viraj's whereabout through a camera on Bradman's neck, as Wagah has hidden him in a yacht near the team's hotel. Both reach the location {{only to discover that}} Wagah has fled leaving behind Viraj tied with a time bomb after Wagah realised that Bradman, who is apparently his pet, carried over his neck a GPS tracker band Junaid tied out to never lose track of Bradman.

After witnessing the blast from a distance Wagah walks into the cricket stadium expecting the <b>match</b> <b>to</b> <b>begin</b> without Viraj. But to his shock Viraj is alive and walks into the ground all ready to play as a parallel flashback reveals Kabir and Junaid helped Viraj {{to get out of the}} jacket by dislocating his shoulder and all three had jumped into water just before the blast.|$|R
