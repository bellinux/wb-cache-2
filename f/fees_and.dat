5|$|In 2008, the NHS in Scotland had around 158,000 staff {{including}} more than 47,500 nurses, midwives and health visitors and over 3,800 consultants.

40|$|This paper uses panel econometric {{techniques}} to estimate a macro-financial model for <b>fee</b> <b>and</b> commission income over total assets {{for a broad}} sample of euro area banks. Using the estimated parameters, it conducts a scenario analysis projecting the <b>fee</b> <b>and</b> commission income ratio over a three years horizon conditional on the baseline and adverse macroeconomic scenarios used in the 2016 EU-wide stress test. The {{results indicate that the}} <b>fee</b> <b>and</b> commission income ratio is varying in particular with changes in its own lag, the shortterm interest rate, stock market returns and real GDP growth. They also show that the <b>fee</b> <b>and</b> commission income ratio projections are more conservative under the adverse scenario than under the baseline scenario. These findings suggest that stress tests assuming scenario-independent <b>fee</b> <b>and</b> commission income projections are likely to be awed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Fee</b> <b>and</b> Dividend or Carbon <b>Fee</b> <b>and</b> Dividend (CF&D) is a market-based {{mechanism}} {{for reducing the}} carbon emissions that help to drive anthropogenic climate change.

This is intended to incentivize a shift to low-carbon energy while protecting consumers from any increases in the costs of carbon-based fuels.|$|R
