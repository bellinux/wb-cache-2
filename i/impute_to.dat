5|$|I {{think you}} will {{recognise}} {{that it was necessary}} to get rid of Brunetto for two reasons. The first is that the visionary figure has now become somewhat more definite and will no doubt be identified by some readers with Yeats though I do not mean anything so precise as that. However, I do not wish to take the responsibility of putting Yeats or anybody else into Hell and I do not want to <b>impute</b> <b>to</b> him the particular vice which took Brunetto there. Secondly, although the reference to that Canto is intended to be explicit, I wish the effect of the whole to be Purgatorial which is more appropriate. That brings us to the reference to swimming in fire which you will remember at the end of Purgatorio 26 where the poets are found.|$|E

He concluded that the provisions requiring that unlawful non-citizens be detained were ambiguous in that in a situation such as Al-Kateb's, where it became impossible to fulfil the purpose {{for which he was}} detained, the law was not clear as to whether {{the result is that the}} detention should be suspended until the purpose becomes possible again, or that the detention should continue indefinitely.

2500|$|Occasional disapproval was voiced, {{with some}} critics noting {{the absence of}} a [...] "central character" [...] and [...] "climactic scene"; its [...] "disappointing finish" [...] and [...] "dependen on an {{arbitrarily}} manipulated plot"; or a general lack of [...] "soul" [...] and sense of [...] "hopelessness". Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph argued that [...] "Chigurh never develops as a character [...] with material as strong as this, one would think they could do better than <b>impute</b> <b>to</b> him a sprawling inscrutability, a mystery that is merely pathological." [...] He further accused it of being full of [...] "pseudo profundities in which [...] have always specialised." [...] In The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter criticized Chigurh's weapons as unintentionally humorous and lamented, [...] "It's all chase, which means that it offers almost zero in character development. Each of the figures is given, a la standard thriller operating procedure, a single moral or psychological attribute and then acts in accordance to that principle and nothing else, without doubts, contradictions or ambivalence." ...|$|E
2500|$|Literary scholar Edward Said, {{who held}} it to exemplify a kind of {{thinking}} that hopes to [...] "cancel and transcend an actual reality—a group of resident Arabs—by means of a future wish – that the land be empty for development by a more deserving power". In his book The Question of Palestine, Said cites the phrase in this wording, [...] "A land without people for a people without a land". S. Ilan Troen and Jacob Lassner call Said's omission of the indefinite article 'a,' a [...] "distortion" [...] of the meaning and suggest that it was done [...] "perhaps malevolently" [...] {{for the purpose of}} making the phrase acquire the meaning that Said and others <b>impute</b> <b>to</b> it, that Zionists thought that the land was or wanted to make it into a land [...] "without people". Steven Poole calls this omission of the indefinite article [...] "a subtle falsification". Historian Adam Garfinkle criticizes Said for attributing the phrase to Zangwill without giving a citation. Garfinkle's heavest criticism, however, is of Said for writing [...] "without people" [...] instead of [...] "without a people", which he says substantially changes the meaning.|$|E

2500|$|Aristarchus's [...] "hyper-criticism" [...] {{establishes}} a science for the mock heroic and follows {{up some of}} the ideas set forth by Pope in Peri Bathos in the Miscellanies, Volume the Third (1727). In this piece, the rules of heroic poetry could be inverted for the proper mock-heroic. The epic hero, Pope says, has wisdom, courage, and love. Therefore, the mock-hero should have [...] "Vanity, Impudence, and Debauchery." [...] As a wise man knows without being told, Pope says, so the vain man listens to no opinion but his own, and Pope quotes Cibber as saying, [...] "Let all the world <b>impute</b> <b>to</b> me what Folly or weakness they please; but till Wisdom can give me something that will make me more heartily happy, I am content to be Gazed at." [...] Courage becomes a hero, Pope says, and nothing is more perversely brave that summoning all one's courage just to the face, and he quotes Cibber's claim in the Apology that his face was almost the best known in England. Chivalric love is the mark of a hero, and Pope says that this is something easy for the young to have. A mock-hero could keep his lust going when old, could claim, as Cibber does, [...] "a man has his Whore" [...] at the age of 80. When the three qualities of wisdom, courage, and love are combined in an epic hero, the result is, according to Pope, magnanimity that induces admiration in the reader. On the other hand, when vanity, impudence, and debauchery are combined in the [...] "lesser epic" [...] hero (Pope uses the term [...] "lesser epic" [...] to refer to the satirical epic that would function like a satire play in the Classical theatre), the result is [...] "Buffoonry" [...] that induces laughter and disgust. Finally, Pope says that Cibber's offences are compounded by the outlandishness of his claims. Although he was [...] "a person never a hero even on the Stage," [...] he sets himself out as an admirable and imitable person who expects applause for his vices.|$|E
