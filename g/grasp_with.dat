5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} <b>grasp</b> <b>with</b> both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp branches with little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E
2500|$|Direct {{sunlight}} is {{a prerequisite}} for cold-blooded reptiles like chameleons. Chameleons also require vegetation for a habitat—preferably with foliage they can easily <b>grasp</b> <b>with</b> their small claws, and perch on. Therefore, most suitable are bushes and small trees with some fine foliage or thin twigs for climbing. Favoured local shrub species [...] include: Restio reeds, daisy bushes, Leonotis bushes, Cape Honeysuckle, Plumbago, Bitou bushes, Psoralea pinnata and many others. Favoured trees are those which provide low and accessible foliage, such as Karee trees, Willows, Pepper trees, Virgilia and others.|$|E
2500|$|In Pressing Grapes (1880), {{two young}} women, their skirts {{gathered}} to their knees, {{stand in a}} stone tub, pressing grapes, as the juice pours into a bucket through a notch {{in the side of}} the tub. [...] The two women stand on either side of a pole suspended from above, which they <b>grasp</b> <b>with</b> their hands to keep their balance. [...] Behind them are arches, through which a richly-forested landscape can be seen below and stretching into the distance. [...] Stone jars and baskets of grapes line the wall. [...] A young girl with a ribbon in her hair leans against a large vessel, her feet on a stool as she watches the women work. [...] The painting was discovered at a home in Portland, Maine in 1997, and subsequently determined to be the work of Weguelin. [...] This may be the same painting as The Vintage.|$|E

40|$|The aims of {{the study}} are to {{determine}} the presence of adjustments in walking behaviour of children with Spastic Hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy (SHCP) during the interception of a moving ball and, whether the angle between the ball and the participant is kept constant. This would {{support the use of}} the so-called bearing angle (BA) strategy in interception of the object. Children with left hemisphere damage intercepted a ball from a conveyor belt at three different velocities, from a frontal or lateral orientation and with their impaired or less-impaired hand. The participants walked from a distance of 4 m perpendicularly to the belt. Children seemed to have less successful trials when <b>grasping</b> <b>with</b> the impaired hand. The results showed that the walking velocity was adjusted to the ball velocity. When they <b>grasped</b> <b>with</b> the impaired hand, children initially moved faster to the interception point, while closer to the belt significant slower. The BA showed less variation over the trajectory when the children <b>grasped</b> <b>with</b> their less-impaired hand or when the ball velocity increased. It was concluded that children with SHCP were able to take their impairment into account as indicated by adjustments in walking behaviour. However, these adjustments in walking velocity were not sufficient to compensate totally for the limited reaching ability in the impaired hand. As a result of these adjustments, the amount of variation from the constant BA seemed to deviate more from typically developing children when <b>grasping</b> <b>with</b> impaired hand than when <b>grasping</b> <b>with</b> less-impaired hand. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} new concept called {{friction}} sensitivity which measures how susceptible a specific grasp is {{to changes in the}} underlying friction coefficients. We develop algorithms for the synthesis of stable <b>grasps</b> <b>with</b> low friction sensitivity and for the synthesis of stable grasps in the case of small friction coefficients. We describe how <b>grasps</b> <b>with</b> low friction sensitivity can be used when a robot has an uncertain belief about friction coefficients and study the statistics of grasp quality under changes in those coefficients. We also provide a parametric estimate for the distribution of grasp qualities and friction sensitivities for a uniformly sampled set of grasps. I...|$|R

40|$|Although it is {{mechanically}} {{possible for}} a robot manipulator to grasp using non- ngertip contacts, there are few examples of this. We call non- ngertip grasping such as <b>grasping</b> <b>with</b> proximal nger phalanges or <b>grasping</b> <b>with</b> the sides of arms body grasping. " While robotic demonstrations are rare, humans commonly use whole body <b>grasps</b> to interact <b>with</b> the world. One of the distinctive features of whole body grasping is the kinematic coupling among potential contacts. This kinematic coupling introduces extra constraints into the grasp synthesis problem. In this paper, we extend recent grasp control techniques to whole body grasping. We show how the grasp control may be parameterized {{with a set of}} contact points {{on the surface of the}} robot manipulator that enables the grasp search to handle the extra kinematic coupling constraints and nd whole body grasps...|$|R
40|$|One {{the most}} {{fundamental}} aspects of the human motor system is the hemispheric asymmetry seen in behavioral specialization. Hemispheric dominance can be inferred by a contralateral hand preference in grasping. Few studies have considered grasp orientation {{in the context of}} manual lateralization and none has looked at <b>grasp</b> orientation <b>with</b> natural prehension. Thirty right-handed adults performed precision grasps of a cylinder using the thumb and index fingers, and the opposition axis (OA) was defined as the line connecting these two contact points on the cylinder. Subjects made ten consecutive <b>grasps</b> <b>with</b> one hand (primary hand movements) followed by ten <b>grasps</b> <b>with</b> the other hand (trailing movements). Differences between primary and trailing grasps revealed that each hemisphere is capable of programming the orientation of the OA and that primary movements with the right hand significantly influenced OA orientation of the trailing left hand. These results extend the hemispheric dominance of the left hemisphere to the final positions of fingers during prehension...|$|R
