25|$|Hall {{started work}} on his history of Nantwich in the mid-1870s; it took nearly a decade to complete. The {{research}} included many visits to churches to document their architecture and to transcribe church registers and memorial inscriptions; he also consulted many library collections, travelling as far afield as Oxford and London. The text was finished on 10 December 1883, the 300th anniversary of the Great Fire of 1583 that destroyed much of the town. The manuscript ran to 1154 <b>foolscap</b> sheets; indexing it took a further month. Walter Hall states that shortly after the book's publication, the Society of Antiquaries offered to confer its fellowship on Hall, but his father declined the honour.|$|E
25|$|Stapleton-Cotton later {{gave him}} access to other {{material}} {{relating to the}} abbey – {{which resulted in the}} manuscript, The History of Combermere, Newhall Township and the Village of Wrenbury – but died in 1898 before this history could be completed. It was never published, as Hall had been relying on the viscount's sponsorship of the project. Walter Hall attempted to bring the work out in 1939, but was prevented by paper shortages during the Second World War. At this date, the Reverend A. L. Moir, vicar of St Mary's and St Michael's, Burleydam, also attempted to obtain the manuscript for publication without success. The manuscript, which ran to 780 <b>foolscap</b> sheets and covered many of the small settlements near the abbey, has since been lost.|$|E
25|$|Ironside kept a diary {{throughout}} his life, starting as a subaltern {{at the turn}} of the century, with the goal of keeping a clear recollection of what had happened during the day and allowing him to reflect on the day's events. These were written directly into bound <b>foolscap</b> volumes, a page or more a day, each night; {{throughout his}} life, he totalled some twelve volumes and the best part of a million words. He did not ask for these to be destroyed on his death, though their content was sometimes quite contentious, but did write a will – in 1930 – asking that they not be published. In the late 1950s, however, a former colleague persuaded him to allow extracts to be published as part of an account of the run-up to the Second World War, although he died shortly before it saw print. This was published as The Ironside Diaries: 1937–1940, edited by Colonel Roderick Macleod and Denis Kelly, in 1962; the material was selected from May 1937 to his retirement in June 1940, and published as numbered daily entries with editorial notes.|$|E
60|$|Is that so? Phidias can niche {{himself into}} the corner of a pediment, and Raffaelle expatiate within the {{circumference}} of a clay platter; but Pugin is inexpressible in less than a cathedral? Let his ineffableness be assured of this, once for all, that no difficulty or restraint ever happened to a man of real power, but his power was the more manifested in the contending with, or conquering it; and that there is no field so small, no cranny so contracted, but that a great spirit can house and manifest itself therein. The thunder that smites the Alp into dust, can gather itself into the width of a golden wire. Whatever greatness there was in you, had it been Buonarroti's own, you had room enough for it in a single niche: you might have put the whole power of it into two feet cube of Caen stone. St. George's was not high enough for want of money? But was it want of money that made you put that blunt, overloaded, laborious ogee door into the side of it? Was it for lack of funds that you sunk the tracery of the parapet in its clumsy zigzags? Was it in parsimony that you buried its paltry pinnacles in that eruption of diseased crockets? or in pecuniary embarrassment that you set up the belfry <b>foolscaps,</b> with the mimicry of dormer windows, which nobody can ever reach nor look out of? Not so, but in mere incapability of better things.|$|R
60|$|But {{what was}} the wild throng that stood hand in hand about the Maypole? It could not be that the fauns and nymphs, when driven from their classic groves and homes of ancient fable, had sought refuge, as all the persecuted did, in the fresh woods of the West. These were Gothic monsters, though perhaps of Grecian ancestry. On the {{shoulders}} of a comely youth uprose the head and branching antlers of a stag; a second, human in all other points, had the grim visage of a wolf; a third, still with the trunk and limbs of a mortal man, showed the beard and horns of a venerable he-goat. There was the likeness of a bear erect, brute in all but his hind legs, which were adorned with pink silk stockings. And here, again, almost as wondrous, stood a real bear of the dark forest, lending each of his forepaws to the grasp of a human hand and as ready for the dance as any in that circle. His inferior nature rose halfway to meet his companions as they stooped. Other faces wore the similitude of man or woman, but distorted or extravagant, with red noses pendulous before their mouths, which seemed of awful depth and stretched {{from ear to ear}} in an eternal fit of laughter. Here might be seen the salvage man--well known in heraldry--hairy as a baboon and girdled with green leaves. By his side--a nobler figure, but still a counterfeit--appeared an Indian hunter with feathery crest and wampum-belt. Many of this strange company wore <b>foolscaps</b> and had little bells appended to their garments, tinkling with a silvery sound responsive to the inaudible music of their gleesome spirits. Some youths and maidens were of soberer garb, yet well maintained their places in the irregular throng by the expression of wild revelry upon their features.|$|R

500|$|Having {{completed}} work on Ulysses, Joyce was {{so exhausted}} {{that he did}} not write a line of prose for a year. On 10 March 1923 he wrote a letter to his patron, Harriet Weaver: [...] "Yesterday I wrote two pages—the first I have since the final Yes of Ulysses. Having found a pen, with some difficulty I copied them out in a large handwriting on a double sheet of <b>foolscap</b> so that I could read them." [...] This is the earliest reference to what would become Finnegans Wake.|$|E

2500|$|Hard {{metrication}} {{which resulted}} in new products based on round metric quantities – for example A4 paper replaced both <b>foolscap</b> and quarto paper and in rugby union 5, 10 and 22metre lines replaced the 5, 10 and 25yard lines respectively. In many cases the new British Standards were based on existing foreign or international standards, for example ISO 216 (based on the German DIN standard DIN 476) which defined the [...] "A series" [...] of paper.|$|E
2500|$|A Committee {{was created}} as a {{response}} to the Peierls-Frisch memorandum. It held its first meeting on 10 April 1940, in the ground floor main committee room of the Royal Society in Burlington House in London. Its meetings were invariable held there. The original members were Thomson, Chadwick, Cockroft, Oliphant and Philip Moon; Patrick Blackett, Charles Ellis and [...] William Haworth were subsequently added, along with a representative of the Director of Scientific Research at the Ministry of Aircraft Production (MAP). The MAUD Committee held its first two meetings in April 1940 before it was formally constituted by CSSAW. CSSAW was abolished in June 1940, and the MAUD Committee then came directly under the MAP. Thomson chaired the committee, and initially acted as its secretary as well, writing up the minutes in longhand on <b>foolscap,</b> until the MAP provided a secretary.|$|E
2500|$|The embattled under-marshal {{would try}} hard to retain {{his power and}} after two months of being accused of the felonies, at last, on 16 December, he showed his poorly written [...] "answer" [...] spread on 9 pages of <b>foolscap.</b> The {{document}} is {{a record of the}} names of all those places mentioned above, where Hitchen met the thieves and organised crimes with them. It also gives the examples of social details, one of which explains how Lord Barnard's bills through a chain of accidents appeared in Hitchen's hands. If one did not tip the porter in the General Post Office, he would throw the letter out. Pickpockets, visiting the Office for their own purpose in the midnight, saw the other one at the door with the bills inside. Seeing the boys with the papers on the one side of the tavern and a sad victim on the other, set Hitchen to assist him. Certainly, this rather comic justification with others added to his main reason of being maliciously persecuted by the robbers was not to blindfold the Court of Aldermen, who were reluctant to take decision against him anyway for the clear reasons discussed above. On the other hand, they could not utterly ignore the Lord Mayor's reminder to the committee, that marshal's behaviour humiliated the City and reflected other officers' behaviour under the Mayor. All they did, though, was rather cynical. After waiting for Hitchen's written defence, presented itself as late as 16 December, they did not read it until 16 January 1713. As for their decision on marshal's suspension, it came over five months late, that was 24 June 1713 and [...] "forbade him attendance on the Lord Mayor" [...] while retaining his power as a constable to obtain warrant when needed and apprehend.|$|E
