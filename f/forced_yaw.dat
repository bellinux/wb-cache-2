40|$|In this ViP {{project the}} focus of {{investigation}} was whether drivers more readily accept either rumble strips or an in-vehicle lane departure warning system (LDW) in unintentional lane departure situations. The results show that acceptance was high for both alternatives, but while the drivers showed more satisfaction from using the LDW, they also showed more trust in the rumble strips. Twenty-four drivers drove the VTI driving simulator SIM III in car mode with simulated rumble strips in one drive and with a simulated Volvo LDW in another drive. A <b>forced</b> <b>yaw</b> motion of the vehicle induced the unintentional lane departures. The results showed no choice in favour of the LDW or the rumble strips, but a clear preference for having a function that warns for unintentional lane departure. Several participants thought {{it was good to}} have both types of warning in parallel. Although Response completion time was shorter with the rumble strips warning, {{there was no difference between}} the warning types, neither in Time to get car back in lane nor in Lane exceedence area. Thus, there were no major overall differences between the LDW and the rumble strips as measured in the present study. The conclusion is that the drivers’ acceptance, as well as performance, was high for both the rumble strips and the LDW. The positive opinion on the need for assistance systems in unintentional lane departure when drivers are directing their visual attention away from the road is thus further strengthened...|$|E
40|$|Yaw {{movements}} {{are the most}} frequently occurring and largest head movements a listener makes when localising; however, previous research has not resolved whether yaw-based head {{movements are}} used in elevation localisation. A series of experiments was devised to investigate the impact of head movement on the elevation localisation response accuracy (LRA) of human listeners. The experiments were conducted using a laser-guided pointing response method, as this was found to allow listeners to more accurately and consistently report a perceived source location than either verbal or graphical methods. 2 kHz low-pass filtered noise with and without a 6 kHz half-octave bandpass component were both shown to suppress pinna cues, and were therefore used to more clearly separate the effect of head movements. Head movements were found to improve azimuth and elevation LRA for noise sources. Depending on stimulus and situation, head movements were shown to make an improvement of up to 8. 5 ˚ in elevation LRA. Head movement improved LRA more for the 2 kHz/ 6 kHz filtered noise than it did for broadband noise; when pinna cues are impaired the significance of head movement cues increases. Both <b>forced</b> <b>yaw</b> movements and free movements significantly improved the elevation LRA. Further experimentation was undertaken {{to determine whether the}} improvement in elevation LRA with head movement was caused by greater accuracy when a source is positioned in the listener’s median plane (a static cue), or by the act of moving the head (a dynamic cue). It was found that the static cue did not provide greater accuracy for sources close to the median plane, and hence it was concluded that dynamic cues increased the elevation LRA for yaw head rotations. For octave and half-octave bandwidth sources, static elevation LRA is lower when the listener has turned to face the source. Yaw head movement improved elevation LRA for high frequency continuous signals, which suggests that dynamic interaural level differences are utilised. Head movements do not improve elevation LRA for programme items with less than an octave bandwidth. For octave programme items, head movements significantly improve elevation LRA, while static LRA shows no improvement; head movement cues are effective at narrower bandwidths than pinna cues. By detailing the nature of head movement cues, one can better inform the localisation model, creating a more accurate representation of the human localisation system...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} coupled {{model for}} the floating off-shore wind turbines, using a 10 -MW machine as an example. The idea put forward is to employ high fidelity Navier-Stokes solvers for air and water. For this reason, the Helicopter Multi-Block solver was used for air, and the Smoothed Particles Hydrodynamic method was used for water. A multi-body solver was implemented to solve for the wind turbine dynamics. All solvers were validated before coupling, and results are presented in this thesis. The employed, loosely coupled, algorithm is described in detail, {{and the importance of}} coupling is assessed. Additional aerodynamic cases were studied to form the foundation for further model development. The study started from the aerodynamic analysis of a 10 -MW wind turbine. Straight and pre-bent configurations of the blade were investigated under the assumption of uniform inflow. Next, the effects of the atmospheric boundary inflow and atmospheric turbulence were studied. For this, the power law wind speed profile was employed, and atmospheric turbulence was introduced using Mann’s model. The aero-elasticity of the 10 -MW rotor was studied next. The structural model was constructed using NASTRAN, and the natural frequencies and modes were compared to published results, showing good agreement. This model was then used for steady and unsteady aero-elastic computations. The effects of employing deformable trailing and leading edge flaps on a 10 -MW wind turbine were also investigated. The results showed that the trailing edge flap can be used to control flap-wise bending of the blade, whilst the leading edge flap can be used to counter additional pitching moment created by the trailing edge flap. A floating 10 -MW rotor was considered next, as well as <b>forced</b> <b>yaw</b> and pitch oscillations of the machine. The results showed large variations in thrust and power as the wind turbine pitched about a point located 119 m below the rotor. The vortex ring state was also encountered when the wind turbine was forced to a pitching motion with amplitude of 5 ° and period of 8. 8 s. A coupled method for the analysis of the dynamics of floating off-shore wind turbines was finally described, along with the test cases and numerical parameters. The results of decoupled and coupled computations are presented and analysed. The results showed that the employed floating turbine under studied conditions did not enter a vortex ring state. A turbulent wake state was encountered, but only at the initial pitching phase. The gyroscopic effects were also small for studied system, and did not cause significant rotations due to large inertia of the employed floater...|$|E

40|$|Summary The report {{comprises}} two contrasting and complementary {{approaches to}} {{the evaluation of the}} second-order aerodynamic side <b>force</b> and <b>yawing</b> moment on lifting wings when leading-edge and side-edge forces play an important r 61 e. In Part I the asual lifting-surface model, in which the vorticity is placed on a planar surface, is shown to lead to inconsistent results; consistent results are obtained when the vorticity is placed on the camber surface while the standard lifting-surface integral equation takes its usual form. In a further supplementary momentum analysis involving the Trefftz plane, the side <b>force</b> and <b>yawing</b> moment are derived from approximate expressions which avoid calculation of any edge forces. In Part II the analysis oflinearised subsonic lifting-surface theory is extended to provide expressions for the leading-edge and side-edge forces. The side <b>force</b> and <b>yawing</b> moment under conditions of asymmetric spanwise loading are obtained as the sum of three contributions, from normal pressures, leading-edge suction and tip suction. These quantities are used to treat lifting wings in roll, and from a few numerical examples some general trends in the theoretical derivatives are observed. The related evidence from experiment and from semi-empirical methods is discussed, and one such method is transcribed for use in conjunction with the theoretical computations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, the {{aerodynamic}} {{characteristics of}} the rocket model that might {{be used in a}} cabin air-launched system have been studied through experiments in low speed wind tunnel. The angle of incidence range is 0 - 80 °, and the speed is 17 m/s or 25 m/s, including typical flight conditions prior to engine ignition. Forces and moments were measured through six-component balance. It is found that vortex asymmetry appears under certain condition with zero side slip. Asymmetrical phenomenon leads to larger side <b>force</b> and <b>yaw</b> moment, which can affect the trajectory of the rocket and put the carrier aircraft at risk. In addition, changes in regulation of the pitching moment with angle of attack are important to longitudinal stability, so the model with convergent-expanded afterbody was designed to improve stability. The effects of nose bluntness and forebody strakes on side <b>force</b> and <b>yaw</b> moment were presented, and the differences of aerodynamic characteristics with pointed and blunt nose, with and without forebody strakes were described. Results show that nose bluntness delays the appearance of asymmetric vortex, and the maximum side force is reduced by at least 50 %.
