5|$|Massa {{was slow}} to {{accelerate}} leaving the turn six hairpin on lap 49, giving Alonso the opening he needed to take the lead. Smedley was later heard apologising to Massa over the radio. De La Rosa made his one and only pit stop of the event for super-soft compound tyres on lap 51. Di Grassi, at turn one on the same lap, hit a kerb damaging his car's rear suspension, which meant {{it was not possible}} for him to continue competing in the race. He was pushed into his garage by his team to retire. Vettel placed pressure on Massa by setting consecutive fastest laps to reduce the time gap between them. Petrov was on course to score one point but was told by his team to shift early into seventh gear on lap 58 otherwise his maximum revolutions per minute would be changed to a lower setting. De La Rosa attempted to lap Kovalainen around the inside of the second corner on the 60th lap but the two cars made contact. De La Rosa sustained damage to a section of his front wing while Kovalainen drove to his garage and <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car to become the race's fifth (and final) retirement on lap 61.|$|E
5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team handed him a fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E
25|$|Šešelj {{states that}} the group was started by Jović but they <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> control. According to Šešelj the White Eagles and Arkan's Tigers {{operated}} {{with help from the}} Yugoslav counterintelligence service.|$|E

25|$|In December 2005, a judge issued arrest {{warrants}} for Flair after a {{road rage}} incident {{that took place}} in Charlotte, North Carolina in which Flair allegedly <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car, grabbed a motorist by the neck, and kicked the door off the motorist's sport utility vehicle. Flair was charged with two misdemeanors, injury to personal property and simple assault and battery. This incident was ridiculed on WWE programming, most notably by the wrestler Edge.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{landing on}} the beach in Nahariya, the group {{followed}} instructions issued in Beirut – which included finding a police officer and killing him. They knocked on the door of a private house and called out in Arabic via the intercom, frightening the residents into calling the police. Then, they killed responding police officer Eliyahu Shahar. According to the Israeli security services' reconstruction of the incident, Shahar was killed after he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vehicle and fired two warning shots into the air. Kuntar's group responded with a massive burst of gunfire. Samir Kuntar boasted that he alone shot 30 bullets in this incident.|$|E

25|$|Frank and Pauline Jeziorski were {{travelling}} {{south on}} Champ Street and had slowed {{to give way}} to traffic on Sydney Rd when Ryan armed with the rifle appeared in front of their car. Ryan threatened the driver and his passenger wife {{to get out of the}}ir car. The driver, Frank Jeziorski, turned his car off, put it in neutral then <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vehicle. Ryan got in via the driver's door. Surpisingly, Pauline Jeziorski refused to get out of the car. She was persuaded by Ryan to get out, only to go back in the car to get her handbag. Paterson, realising Ryan was armed, returned inside the prison to get a rifle.|$|E
25|$|By late Saturday afternoon, {{concerns}} were rising about driver safety on the track. Patrick Carpentier {{went to the}} medical facility to have his wrist checked (a previous injury he had suffered in a crash at Long Beach.) As an aside, he mentioned {{that he could not}} walk in a straight line for at least four minutes after he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car. An impromptu survey was taken during the private drivers' meeting and 21 of the 25 drivers in the starting field reported suffering disorientation and vertigo-like symptoms, including inner ear, or vision problems, after running more than 10 laps (or 20 laps). They also claimed that they had had virtually no peripheral vision and limited reaction time. This was due to sustained g-loads as high as 5.5--almost double what most persons can endure, and closer to what jet pilots usually experience in shorter time intervals.|$|E
25|$|As Bryant {{drove down}} to Seascape, he shot at a red Ford Falcon coming the other way, smashing its front windscreen. Upon {{arriving}} at Seascape, he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car. A Holden Frontera 4WD vehicle then approached Seascape along the road. Those in the vehicle saw Bryant with his gun, but believed him to be rabbit hunting and actually slowed down as they passed him. Bryant fired into the car; the first bullet hit the bonnet and broke the throttle cable. He fired at least twice more into the car as it passed, breaking the windows. One bullet hit the driver, Linda White, in the arm. The car was going downhill so {{it was able to}} roll down the road out of sight around a corner. White swapped seats with her boyfriend, Michael Wanders, who attempted to drive the car, but was unable to, because of the broken throttle cable.|$|E

6000|$|... "If I thought I {{was going}} crazy, I'd--I'd--well I guess I'd jump overboard," [...] said Tom, and he heaved a deep sigh. Then he very {{abruptly}} {{turned to the}} table, <b>got</b> <b>out</b> one <b>of</b> <b>his</b> text books, and commenced to study.|$|R
60|$|Everybody {{said it was}} a real {{beautiful}} oath, {{and asked}} Tom if he <b>got</b> it <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own head. He said, some of it, but the rest was <b>out</b> <b>of</b> pirate-books and robber-books, and every gang that was high-toned had it.|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Jacksons' disappearance, a local couple {{came forward to}} report that they had had a {{frightening}} experience with a tall, darked-haired man that same afternoon. The man had driven behind and around them in a blue, older-model Chevrolet, flashing his headlights and forcing them off the road. The man later <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car and menacingly approached the couple; sensing danger, they reversed and managed to flee the scene. After Mildred and Susan Jackson's bodies were found, detectives discovered an abandoned building near their dump site—reportedly the same cinderblock structure that had been searched after Margaret Harold's killing. Inside, they found a red button missing from Mildred's dress, indicating {{that she had been}} taken there after being kidnapped. Near the building were fresh tire marks. After finding points of comparison between the Harold and Jackson cases—mainly the general area of the murders and the sadistic nature of the crimes—investigators determined that both homicides were committed by the same culprit.|$|E
25|$|The 1988 {{race was}} also sunny, but had two restarts. The {{first one was}} because of a huge {{accident}} involving David Hunt (brother of former F1 champion, James Hunt) {{was involved in a}} massive shunt, clipping Claudio Langes' car as the cars front of them slowed down due to the Bertrand Gachot/Andy Wallace accident at the Zenith Turn (Hunt's car managed to punch a massive hole into a wholesalers' shop wall at the fast Loctite Corner). The second stoppage was due to an incident involving Russell Spence. After his car spun, blocking the road, a crane came to move his car. Spence was still in the car, and frantically waving at the crane driver to put his car down facing the right way. The car was lowered, but not in the right place and Spence <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car, and then the leaders {{got caught up in the}} incident. Roberto Moreno took the chequered flag after the 2nd restart, with Martin Donnelly and Martini in second and third respectively.|$|E
25|$|One 45-minute {{practice}} session on Sunday morning was held before {{the early afternoon}} race. Bird recorded the fastest lap time of the third {{practice session}}, {{which took place in}} dry and warm weather conditions, at one minute and 2.209 seconds, almost two-tenths of a second ahead of Vergne in second and Engel was third. Turvey was fourth-fastest; Piquet was fifth and Dillmann sixth. Lynn was seventh-fastest, di Grassi eighth, d'Ambrosio ninth and Heidfeld rounded out the top ten ahead of second qualifying. Dillmann broke his front-left suspension following an impact with the barrier leaving the turn six hairpin. He could not drive back to pit lane, and stopped his car at the next corner, necessitating a red flag. Di Grassi carried excessive speed driving into the turn one hairpin, and steered in the opposite direction to continue driving. The session ended early when Frijns lost control of his car's rear-end, and hit the turn ten wall, littering the circuit with debris. Frijns <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> vehicle but limped slightly, possibly caused by hitting his leg on his car's monocoque cell.|$|E
60|$|I {{saw there}} was nothing further to be <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Mayfield. <b>His</b> opinion was fixed; he was a placid ruminant. But he had given me already much food for thought. I thanked him for his assistance, and {{returned}} on foot to my rooms at the hospital.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} hours of the morning on Wednesday, January 23, 1991, at {{approximately}} 1:20a.m., Lunsford spotted a suspicious vehicle travelling along U.S. Highway 59, a white 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme with Maine license plates. Lunsford pulled the vehicle over to the side of the road and turned on his dashboard camera to record the traffic stop. He then <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> cruiser and approached the vehicle. Inside the vehicle were three men, Baldemar Sambrano Villarreal, his younger half brother, Reynaldo Sambrano Villarreal, and their accomplice, Jesus Cortez Zambrano. Lunsford questioned the driver, Reynaldo Villarreal, and asked whether he had any ID on him, to which Villarreal replied no. He claimed that he had a driver's license but did not have it on him. He also said that he was helping his brother, Baldemar, drive the car. Unbeknownst to Lunsford, the three men had loaded the car with 31 pounds of marijuana, and were driving from Houston, Texas, to Chicago, Illinois, where they planned to sell it all. At 1:27a.m., Lunsford asked to look in the trunk of the vehicle and the men reluctantly agreed. Lunsford and Reynaldo opened the trunk and Lunsford could immediately smell the scent of marijuana.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Rosberg recorded the fastest {{time of the}} day with a lap of one minute and 12.123 seconds; teammate Hamilton was second-fastest having set the fastest second sector time of any other driver and Räikkönen was third. Ricciardo was fourth-fastest, ahead of Williams drivers Bottas and Massa. Alonso, Kvyat, Vettel and Magnussen followed in the top ten. The session was disrupted three times: firstly for Vergne who stopped on track at turn four when his engine had a sudden loss of power after 11 minutes. The second stoppage was caused by Alonso when his engine caught fire and stopped on the straight between turns three and four. He <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Ferrari, ran behind a barrier, and took a fire extinguisher to stop the blaze before marshals could reach his car. Gutiérrez triggered the final red flag period when his car stopped with an energy recovery system failure with thirteen minutes remaining. The final practice session was held in dry but overcast weather conditions and saw Rosberg complete a free practice sweep with the fastest time of one minute and 10.446 seconds on soft compound tyres. Hamilton was second-fastest and locked his tyres and spun while braking for the Senna S chicane. He was later delayed by a Lotus car while on a fast lap. The two Williams drivers were third and fourth (with Massa ahead of Bottas); Ricciardo was fifth and Button sixth. Räikkönen was seventh-fastest, Alonso eighth, Magnussen ninth and Kvyat rounded out the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, Senna's {{determination}} to win {{manifested itself in}} dismay at McLaren's inability to challenge Williams's all-conquering FW14B car. McLaren's new car for the season had several shortcomings. A delay occurred in getting the new model running (it debuted in the third race of the season, the Brazilian Grand Prix) {{and in addition to}} lacking active suspension, the new car suffered from reliability issues and was unpredictable in fast corners, while its Honda V12 engine was no longer the most powerful on the circuit. During practice for the second race of the season in Mexico on a circuit Senna was heavily critical of, his car hit a bump that caused a loss of downforce and hard crash into a concrete retaining wall. He had to be extricated from the car by circuit doctors; although he raced the next day, albeit retiring from the race due to gearbox failure. Senna scored wins in Monaco, Hungary, and Italy that year. During qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix, French driver Érik Comas crashed heavily and Senna was the first to arrive at the scene. He <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car and ran across the track to help the Frenchman, disregarding his own safety in an effort to aid a fellow driver. He later went to visit Comas in the hospital. His actions won universal praise from those in Formula One and seemed to soften his hard-nosed image. Senna finished fourth overall in the championship, behind the Williams duo of Mansell and Riccardo Patrese, and Benetton's Michael Schumacher.|$|E
60|$|Mike <b>got</b> up <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> chair. He {{could not}} quite follow what all this was about, {{but there was no}} mistaking the truculence of Adair's manner.

500|$|On April 27, 1958, Richard and Pat Nixon {{embarked}} on a goodwill tour of South America. In Montevideo, Uruguay, Nixon made an impromptu visit to a college campus, where he fielded questions from students on U.S. foreign policy. The trip was uneventful until the Nixon party reached Lima, Peru, where he was met with student demonstrations. Nixon went to the campus, <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car to confront the students, and stayed until forced {{back into the car}} by a volley of thrown objects. At his hotel, Nixon faced another mob, and one demonstrator spat on him. In Caracas, Venezuela, Nixon and his wife were spat on by anti-American demonstrators and their limousine was attacked by a pipe-wielding mob. According to Ambrose, Nixon's courageous conduct [...] "caused even some of his bitterest enemies to give him some grudging respect".|$|E
500|$|Following the England tour, the Australians {{returned}} home via a tour to the Indian subcontinent. The first stop was Karachi, where Australia played its first ever Test against Pakistan. Lindwall's poor run continued, scoring {{two and a}} duck and taking match figures of 1/64 as Australia fell to a nine wicket defeat. The team travelled to Madras {{for the first of}} three Tests in India. Lindwall briefly bowled on the first morning without success before succumbing to a severe stomach bug. He took no further part in the first innings and spent the next two days in bed. Lindwall briefly <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> bed on day three to bat, making only eight as Australia took a 158 run first innings lead. He hauled himself out of bed on the fourth day, and cut through the Indians in three spells, taking 7/43 in an innings victory.|$|E
500|$|The Jets {{had high}} hopes for 1999, but {{suffered}} a blow in the season opener when Testaverde ruptured his Achilles tendon and was lost for the season. New York suffered other injuries and fell to a 2–6 record before recovering to finish 8–8. Two days {{after the end of}} the season, Parcells announced his resignation as coach; he remained with the team for a year as chief of football operations. Belichick was slated to become head coach in Parcells' place, but one day later, he announced his own resignation. [...] Robert Kraft had gotten word to Belichick through intermediaries that he could have complete control of football operations and a $2 million salary if he <b>got</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> contract with the Jets. After a lawsuit to void Belichick's contract failed and Tagliabue refused to release him, the Jets and Patriots agreed on draft choice compensation for the Jets.|$|E
