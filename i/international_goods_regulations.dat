50|$|The {{most widely}} applied {{regulatory}} scheme {{is that for}} the transportation of dangerous goods. The United Nations Economic and Social Council issues the UN Recommendations on the Transport of Dangerous Goods, which form the basis for most regional, national, and international regulatory schemes. For instance, the International Civil Aviation Organization has developed dangerous <b>goods</b> <b>regulations</b> for air transport of hazardous materials that are based upon the UN Model but modified to accommodate unique aspects of air transport. Individual airline and governmental requirements are incorporated with this by the International Air Transport Association to produce the widely used IATA Dangerous <b>Goods</b> <b>Regulations</b> (DGR). Similarly, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has developed the <b>International</b> Maritime Dangerous <b>Goods</b> Code ("IMDG Code", part of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea) for transportation of dangerous goods by sea. IMO member countries have also developed the HNS Convention to provide compensation in case of dangerous goods spills in the sea.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to analyse the level of good {{governance}} understanding implementation in Indonesia regional governments, identify impeding variables to good governance implementation, and evaluate the extent of <b>international</b> <b>good</b> governance standards alignment. The influence of economic and political transition, decentralisation and regional autonomy regime, bureaucracy culture, and political history is analysed to reflect the degree of good governance implementation and level of convergence to <b>international</b> <b>good</b> governance standards. The methodological approach involves a triangulation of in-depth interview, document analysis, and <b>International</b> <b>Good</b> Governance Standard comparison. Findings from the study reflect disparities in good governance understanding and implementation between Indonesia regional governments, nine main impeding variables to good governance implementation including bureaucratic culture and political history, and a positive response to convergence towards <b>international</b> <b>good</b> governance standard alignment. Findings also act as an in depth study and analysis of current Indonesia regional government situation, resulting in inputs and recommendations geared towards public policy development and good governance implementation guidelines...|$|R
