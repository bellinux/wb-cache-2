50|$|Because the masonry veneer is non-structural, {{it must be}} {{tied back}} to the {{building}} structure to prevent movement under wind and <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads.</b> This is usually accomplished by a means that does not interrupt the drainage plane and does not compromise cavity insulation.

Although the veneer is vertically self-supporting, shelf angles are often used in multi-story buildings, typically at floor edges, to provide a horizontal expansion joint that allows expansion of the brick and potential shrinkage of the frame. In multi-story buildings, such a system may be called a curtain wall.|$|E
50|$|The Cantilever {{method is}} an {{approximate}} method for calculating shear forces and moments developed in beams and columns of a frame or structure due to lateral loads. The applied lateral loads typically include wind loads and <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads,</b> {{which must be}} taken into consideration while designing buildings. The assumptions used in this method are that the points of contraflexure (or points of inflection of the moment diagram) in both the vertical and horizontal members are located at the midpoint of the member, and that the direct stresses in the columns are proportional to their distances from the centroidal axis of the frame. The frame is analysed in step-wise (iterative) fashion, and the results can then be described by force diagrams drawn {{up at the end of}} the process. The method is quite versatile and can be used to analyse frames of any number of storeys or floors.|$|E

Modern construction codes call {{for the use of}} reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a lintel is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads</b> to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.|$|E

30|$|In this research, we {{endeavored}} {{to determine the}} key factors affecting the vulnerability of RMG factory buildings to vertical and <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads</b> by use of ordered probit modeling. A number of factors were found to influence the vulnerability of buildings to vertical and <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads.</b> It is {{important to realize that}} if a structure is vulnerable to vertical loads, then that structure is sure to be vulnerable to <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads.</b> This statement is very much evident from the model results. To be more specific, we demonstrated that column capacity is the most influential factor governing both earthquake and vertical load vulnerabilities. To ensure the required design strength of the structural members of a building, and thereby to get proper resistance against vertical and <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads,</b> the best quality of construction materials should be chosen. Structural system was found to be another significant factor that influences vertical as well as earthquake load vulnerability. To reduce earthquake load vulnerability, structures must have enough lateral force resistance. In that case, structural system and irregular internal frame play vital roles. Superstructures having adequate resistance to lateral loads may collapse due to soil liquefaction {{in the case of an}} earthquake. Thus, soil liquefaction and irregular internal frame are the other significant factors that influence earthquake load vulnerability.|$|E
30|$|Model {{results show}} that {{vulnerability}} to <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads</b> is positively affected by column slenderness (estimated parameter: 0.449; Table  2). Column slenderness has weak positive correlation with both column capacity (0.120; Table  4) and vulnerability to <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads</b> (0.127; Table  4). Similarly, pounding positively affects building vulnerability to <b>earthquake</b> <b>loads</b> (estimated parameter: 0.273; Table  2). A majority of the factory buildings (about 61 %) {{do not have an}} adequate gap with adjacent buildings, which leads to an enhanced impact of the pounding effect (Fig.  5 b) on closely clustered factory buildings. In the event of a major earthquake, this inadequate gap can cause serious damage to the structures. Hao (2015) stated that the pounding usually causes local damage around the collision-impacted area. Collapse of the building structures may also happen in extreme cases. Thus any increase in the pounding effect will obviously increase earthquake load vulnerability.|$|E
