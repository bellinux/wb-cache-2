5|$|Værnes {{is first}} {{recorded}} in the 10th century as the seat for one of eight chieftains in Trøndelag. The first military activity in the area was {{as a base for}} leidang. After the Viking Age, the farm at Værnes was taken over by the king and became the seat of the vogt. From 1671, the farm was owned by a series of military officers and public servants. In 1887, the farm was bought by the Royal Norwegian Army and converted to a camp. The first aircraft to use Værnes was a military Farman MF.7 Longhorn, which took off on 26 March 1914. It was part of the plan to establish the Norwegian Army Air Service, for which Værnes was chosen as the <b>initial</b> <b>station</b> for Central Norway. Radio equipment was installed in 1919 and the first hangar was built in 1920. By 1922, the grass field serving as runway has become insufficient for newer planes, both in terms of length and level, but an extension was not performed until 1925. In 1927, parliament passed legislation to move the division to Rinnleiret from 1930, but this was later annulled. With the delivery of Fokker aircraft in 1930, the runway was again upgraded and extended.|$|E
25|$|With a {{connection}} to the capital, plans surfaced for the standard gauge line to be extended northwards through Gudbrandsdalen. With the extension to Sel approved in 1890, three proposals surfaced for the route through Hamar. All three cut the town off from the lakeshore. One involved the line being carried across a swing bridge which would allow access to the port, while two proposed a line across Høiensalodden, either the chosen route or one along Skappelsgate. The second station building had been built further away from the market square and there was a desire to build a new station closer to the town center. The site of the first station was therefore chosen as a suitable site for a new terminal building. The <b>initial</b> <b>station</b> was moved across the street, where it remained until it was demolished in 1925.|$|E
500|$|Another {{planning}} {{office was}} established in 1962, initially led by Erik Himle. The final plans for the route were passed by parliament in 1968, and construction started in 1971. The <b>initial</b> <b>station</b> was entirely blasted in bedrock and consisted of a single platform, [...] long and [...] wide. Adjacent to the bedrock is a layer of construction concrete and above the platforms, there are corrugated steel plates to catch drips and to reduce noise. The section of line past Nationaltheatret {{was part of a}} [...] section of the Oslo Tunnel designated Studenterlunden. Of this, [...] was to run with the Common Tunnel of the Oslo Metro directly above it, resulting in a two-story tunnel. However, just east of Nationaltheatret, the two lines diverge, so the metro station is not directly on top of the railway station.|$|E
50|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>stations</b> from Bathgate Junction (near Ratho) were Broxburn, Houston, and Bathgate.|$|R
50|$|Eight <b>initial</b> <b>stations</b> {{were built}} during the {{construction}} of the High Speed Rail system: Taipei, Banqiao, Taoyuan, Hsinchu, Taichung, Chiayi, Tainan, and Zuoying (Kaohsiung).|$|R
50|$|Sinclair's news {{operations}} {{had launched}} six drone teams in September 2016. <b>Initial</b> <b>stations</b> getting drone teams were in Washington, Baltimore, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Columbus, Ohio; Tulsa, Oklahoma and Little Rock, Arkansas.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>station</b> {{opened on}} 31 May 1898. With the {{construction}} of the Sognsvann Line, Frøen became both a stop on it as well as the interchange between the two lines. It therefore received four separate platforms at three different elevations. It served trains on the Sognsvann Line from 10 October 1934 until 1992. Frøen received a slight upgrade in 2010. However, Ruter plans to close it down and replace it and Steinerud with a new station.|$|E
2500|$|The Commonwealth of Massachusetts {{pioneered the}} concept of [...] "Park and Ride" [...] by {{providing}} funds to construct the Route 128 Station on NH's Providence Line, at a location where the radial line intersected with the Massachusetts Route 128, locally {{thought of as the}} [...] "Boston Beltway". Route 128 Station was established 1953 by NH President Frederic C. Dumaine, Jr.. The <b>initial</b> <b>station</b> was simple in design, built as a parking lot located next to the tracks.|$|E
2500|$|In 1916, Bush {{continued}} to {{rank among the}} American League leaders in multiple categories with 75 bases on balls (7th), 27 sacrifice hits (9th), 435 assists (5th among all players regardless of position), 278 putouts at shortstop (4th), and a [...]954 fielding percentage at shortstop (3rd). Baseball Magazine, in choosing its All Star American League Team, chose Bush at the shortstop position. Writer F. C. Lane observed: [...] "But the best performer, taking everything into consideration, was Donie Bush of Detroit. Bush is simply unsurpassable as a fielding shortstop and while a weak hitter according to the records he is nevertheless a dangerous man on the offensive through his well-known ability to secure free passage to first base and his amazing swiftness of foot once he reaches that <b>initial</b> <b>station</b> on the homeward journey." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{refuelling}} stations for AFVs (alternative fuel vehicles) is limited {{during the early}} stges of the diffusion of AFVs. Different layouts of these <b>initial</b> <b>stations</b> will result in different degrees of driver concern regardng refueling and will therefore influence dividuals' decisions to adopt AFVs. The question becomes "what is an optimal layout for these <b>initial</b> <b>stations?</b> Should it target all drivers or just a portion of them, and if so, which portion?" Further, how does the number of <b>initial</b> AFV refueling <b>stations</b> influence the adoption of AFVs? This paper explores these questions with agent-based simulations. Using Shanghai as the basis of computational experiments, this paper first generates different optimal layouts using a genetic algorithm to minimize the total concern of different targeted drivers and then conducts agent-based simulations on the diffusion of AFVs with these layout. The main findings of this study are that (1) targeting drivers in the city center can induce the fastest diffusion of AFVs if AV technologies are mature and (2) it is possible that a larger number of <b>initial</b> AFV refueling <b>stations</b> may result in slower diffusion of AFVs because these <b>initial</b> <b>stations</b> may not have sufficient customers to survive. The simulations can provide some insights for cities that are trying to promote the diffusion of AFVs...|$|R
50|$|The {{construction}} {{plan was}} developed {{many years ago}} and as the city has expanded and transport needs have changed greatly, critics argue that the <b>initial</b> <b>stations</b> will be of little help in reducing traffic congestion or improving the transportation system.|$|R
50|$|As {{one of the}} <b>initial</b> <b>stations</b> of the Dubai Metro, Rashidiya {{opened on}} 9 September 2009; trains ran to Nakheel Harbour and Tower and served seven {{intermediate}} stations.

50|$|The <b>initial</b> <b>station</b> {{building}} was a temporary wooden structure; it was replaced in 1852 {{by a small}} masonry building. The masonry, however, had an odd shape: a part of its front had eight arched openings, which went further forward than the other part with only three.|$|E
50|$|Four {{days into}} 1939, Aylwin got {{underway}} for Panama and reached Balboa on 13 January. After transiting the Panama Canal the next day, she operated out of Gonaïves, Haiti; Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; and, Port-au-Prince, Haiti, before getting underway on the 13th for her <b>initial</b> <b>station</b> during Fleet Problem XX.|$|E
40|$|There are {{a limited}} number of <b>initial</b> {{refueling}} <b>stations</b> for AFVs (alternative-fuel vehicles). With different layouts for these <b>initial</b> refueling <b>stations,</b> potential AFV adopters will have different concerns regarding the availability of refueling facilities, which will result in different starting points for the diffusion of AFVs. This paper explores the issue of optimizing layouts of <b>initial</b> AFV refueling <b>stations</b> to provide a better starting point for the diffusion of AFVs. This paper first puts forward the optimization models in terms of minimizing drivers’ total concern in two situations: in the first situation, the number of <b>initial</b> AFV refueling <b>stations</b> is fixed, and in the second situation, the number of <b>initial</b> AFV refueling <b>stations</b> is flexible within a certain scope. The paper then introduces a genetic algorithm to find nearly optimal solutions for the optimization models. Finally, experiments are conducted with agent-based simulations for the case of Shanghai, which shows that the close-to-optimal layouts generated using the models can promote the diffusion of AFVs...|$|R
