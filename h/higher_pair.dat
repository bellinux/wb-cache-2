The theory systematizes single- and multiple-contact kinematic analysis by mapping it into geometric computation in configuration space. It derives the contact conditions, contact functions, and relations between contacts from {{the shapes and}} degrees of freedom of the parts. It helps identify common design flaws, such as undercutting, interference, and jamming, that cannot be systematically identified with current methods.

With <b>higher</b> <b>pairs,</b> the two elements are in contact at a point or along a line, as in a ball bearing or disk cam and follower; the relative motions of coincident points are dissimilar. Lower pairs are those for which area contact may be visualized, as in pin connections, crossheads, ball-and socket joints and some others; the relative motion of coincident points of the elements, and hence of their links, are similar, and an exchange of elements from one link to the other does not alter the relative motion of the parts as it would with <b>higher</b> <b>pairs.</b>|$|R

50|$|The general {{principle}} {{after the first}} and second throws is to keep the largest number of similar dice and rethrow the rest. When a player has a full house he will keep the three-of-a-kind. When you have two pairs keep the <b>higher</b> <b>pair</b> and rethrow the other three dice. If you have a large straight, keep it. If you have a small straight, keep it and re-roll the fifth die. If all the dice are different and there is no straight, keep just the 5. There are a number of exceptions to these rules. These exceptions are different for the second and third rolls.|$|E

50|$|The {{strategy}} {{to maximize the}} chance of getting a three-of-a-kind involves keeping any three-of-a-kind that is rolled. If a three-of-a-kind is rolled then after the first throw the player should keep any other 5s and 6s, while after the second throw the player should keep any other 4s, 5s, and 6s. An example is with 22225 the player keeps 2225 and throws the other 2. If a three-of-a-kind is not rolled the player should keep any pair that is rolled and re-roll the other dice, with two pairs the player should keep the <b>higher</b> <b>pair,</b> and with no pair the player should keep the highest die. Following this strategy gives a 74.32% chance of getting a three-of-a-kind.|$|E
50|$|The {{strategy}} to maximize his {{chance of getting}} a four-of-a-kind involves keeping any four-of-a-kind that he has. If he has a four-of-a-kind then after the first throw he will keep the other {{if it is a}} 5 and 6, while after the second throw he will keep it if it is a 4, 5 or 6. So that with 22223 he keeps 2222 and will throw the 3. If he does not have a four-of-a-kind, the player should keep any three-of-a-kind or pair that he has and re-roll the other dice. With two pairs he will keep the <b>higher</b> <b>pair.</b> With no pair he will keep the highest die. Following this strategy gives him a 29.08% chance of getting a four-of-a-kind.|$|E
50|$|Each player must lay a card {{equal to}} or higher in value than {{the one at the}} top of the pick up pile, then draw cards from the deck so they have at least three cards in their hand (unless the deck has run out of cards or they already have three or more cards in their hand). If a player has no single card that is higher in value than the {{previous}} card they may play a pair of cards, in which case the next player must play a <b>higher</b> <b>pair</b> or a triple. If they cannot play a card (or cards), they must pick up the pick-up pile (put it in their hand) and end their turn. In some variants when two cards of the same value are played the next player is skipped.|$|E

5000|$|Many Finnish pilots {{racked up}} {{enormous}} scores by using basic tactics against Soviet aircraft. The default tactic was the four-plane [...] "parvi" [...] (swarm), {{with a pair}} flying lower as bait, and a <b>higher</b> <b>pair</b> to dive on enemy interceptors. The Soviet Air Force {{was never able to}} counteract this tactic. The top-scoring B-239 pilot was Hans Wind, with 39 kills. Lt Hans Wind, with six other Buffalos of LeLv 24, intercepted some 60 Soviet aircraft near Kronstad. Two Soviet Pe-2 bombers, one Soviet Hawker Hurricane fighter, and 12 I-16s were claimed for the loss of just one B-239 (BW-378). [...] After evaluation of claims against actual Soviet losses, aircraft BW-364 was found to have been used to achieve 42½ kills in total by all pilots operating it, possibly making it the highest-scoring fighter airframe in the history of air warfare.

5000|$|Starting {{hands with}} three or four cards of one rank are very bad. In fact, the worst {{possible}} hand in the game is [...] Since the only possible combination of two cards from this hand is 2-2, it is impossible to make low. As no deuce remains to appear on the board, it will be impossible to make three deuces or deuces full, and anyone with any matching card to the board will make a <b>higher</b> <b>pair.</b> Likewise, starting with four cards of one suit makes it less likely that {{you will be able to}} make a flush. Starting with four different suits yields no chance for a flush, and starting with four disconnected cards reduces straight possibilities. Computer analysis of the best starting hands has proven that the best starting hand for Omaha is A-A-K-K (double suited). One favorite starting hand for Omaha is A-A-J-10 (double suited), because of its wider range for making the nut straight (J-7, Q-8, K-9, and A-10). For the Hi-Lo variation, the most valuable starting holding is A-A-2-3 (double suited).|$|E
