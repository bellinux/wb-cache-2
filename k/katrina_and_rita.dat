25|$|ACE {{measures}} {{a combination}} of both the strength and duration of a tropical cyclone, so longer-lasting storms may accumulate more ACE than stronger storms with shorter durations. This discrepancy is most obvious in the comparatively high ACE value of Hurricane Emily to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita: Emily was not as strong as either storm, but formed out in the Atlantic and made a long track across the Caribbean Sea before making landfall. <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rita,</b> however, both developed in the Bahamas, close to the U.S. mainland, and lasted for much shorter periods of time. In addition, Ophelia and Epsilon are high for their intensity because they maintained themselves {{for a long period of}} time and were slow to build and dissipate, as neither was ever more intense than a Category1 storm.|$|E

25|$|Hurricanes pose {{a severe}} {{threat to the}} area, and the city is {{particularly}} at risk because of its low elevation; because it is surrounded by water from the north, east, and south; and because of Louisiana's sinking coast. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, New Orleans is the nation's most vulnerable city to hurricanes. Indeed, portions of Greater New Orleans have been flooded by: the Grand Isle Hurricane of 1909, the New Orleans Hurricane of 1915, 1947 Fort Lauderdale Hurricane, Hurricane Flossy in 1956, Hurricane Betsy in 1965, Hurricane Georges in 1998, Hurricanes <b>Katrina</b> <b>and</b> <b>Rita</b> in 2005, and Hurricane Gustav in 2008, with the flooding in Betsy being significant {{and in a few}} neighborhoods severe, and that in Katrina being disastrous in the majority of the city.|$|E
