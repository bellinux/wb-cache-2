5|$|<b>Fusion</b> is {{the process}} by which two lipid bilayers merge, {{resulting}} in one connected structure. If this <b>fusion</b> proceeds completely through both leaflets of both bilayers, a water-filled bridge is formed and the solutions contained by the bilayers can mix. Alternatively, if only one leaflet from each bilayer is involved in the <b>fusion</b> process, the bilayers are said to be hemifused. <b>Fusion</b> is involved in many cellular processes, in particular in eukaryotes, since the eukaryotic cell is extensively sub-divided by lipid bilayer membranes. Exocytosis, fertilization of an egg by sperm and transport of waste products to the lysozome {{are a few of the}} many eukaryotic processes that rely on some form of <b>fusion.</b> Even the entry of pathogens can be governed by <b>fusion,</b> as many bilayer-coated viruses have dedicated <b>fusion</b> proteins to gain entry into the host cell.|$|E

40|$|Gene <b>fusions</b> {{have been}} {{described}} in approximately one-third of soft tissue tumors (STT); of the 142 different <b>fusions</b> that have been reported, more than half are recurrent in the same histologic subtype. These gene <b>fusions</b> constitute pivotal driver mutations, and detailed studies of their cellular effects have provided important knowledge about pathogenetic mechanisms in STT. Furthermore, most <b>fusions</b> are strongly associated with a particular histotype, serving as ideal molecular diagnostic markers. In recent years, it has also become apparent that some chimeric proteins, directly or indirectly, constitute excellent treatment targets, making the detection of gene <b>fusions</b> in STT ever more important. Indeed, pharmacological treatment of STT displaying <b>fusions</b> that activate protein kinases, such as ALK and ROS 1, or growth factors, such as PDGFB, is already in clinical use. However, the vast majority (52 / 78) of recurrent gene <b>fusions</b> create structurally altered and/or deregulated transcription factors, and {{a small but growing}} subset develops through rearranged chromatin regulators.

5|$|Each <b>fusion</b> {{event in}} the D-T <b>fusion</b> reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a fast neutron with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the <b>fusion</b> section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the <b>fusion</b> bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a <b>fusion</b> reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the <b>fusion</b> reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E

In 2011, Folding@home began simulations {{of the dynamics}} of the enzyme RNase H, a key component of HIV, to try to design drugs to deactivate it. Folding@home has also been used to study membrane <b>fusion,</b> an essential event for viral infection and a wide range of biological functions. This <b>fusion</b> involves conformational changes of viral <b>fusion</b> proteins and protein docking, but the exact molecular mechanisms behind <b>fusion</b> remain largely unknown. <b>Fusion</b> events may consist of over a half million atoms interacting for hundreds of microseconds.

40|$|The Pseudomonas oleovorans alkane hydroxylase is an {{integral}} cytoplasmic membrane protein that is expressed and active in both Escherichia coli and P. oleovorans. Its primary sequence contains eight hydrophobic stretches that could span the membrane as alpha-helices. The topology of alkane hydroxylase was studied in E. coli using protein <b>fusions</b> linking different amino-terminal fragments of the alkane hydroxylase (AlkB) to alkaline phosphatase (PhoA) and to beta-galactosidase (LacZ). Four AlkB-PhoA <b>fusions</b> were constructed using transposon TnphoA. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to create PstI sites at 12 positions in AlkB. These sites were used to create AlkB-PhoA and AlkB-LacZ <b>fusions.</b> With respect to alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase activity each set of AlkB-PhoA and AlkB-LacZ <b>fusions</b> revealed the expected complementary activities. At three positions, PhoA <b>fusions</b> were highly active, whereas the corresponding LacZ <b>fusions</b> were the least active. At all other positions the PhoA <b>fusions</b> were almost completely inactive, but the corresponding LacZ <b>fusions</b> were highly active. These data predict a model for alkane hydroxylase containing six transmembrane segments.

40|$|Reporter gene <b>fusions</b> are {{essential}} tools {{for the investigation}} of gene regulation. Such <b>fusions</b> are traditionally generated by transposon mutagenesis and identified by a suitable selection procedure.

Here, we describe a novel approach for the rapid generation of reporter gene <b>fusions</b> in single copies at defined positions in bacterial genomes. This technique utilizes the Red recombinase for the homologous recombination of PCR-generated cassettes containing various currently used reporter genes, such as those for β-galactosidase, luciferase, and green fluorescent protein. The approach allows the generation of transcriptional or translational reporter <b>fusions</b> in a single step without the requirement for recombinant DNA constructs and is applicable to various enterobacterial species. Generation of reporter <b>fusions</b> by Red recombination is rapid, overcomes the current limitations of transposon mutagenesis or reporter plasmids, and offers new options {{for the study of}} bacterial gene regulation...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fusions</b> of the lac operon to genes {{induced by}} {{treatment}} with sublethal levels of alkylating agents {{have been selected}} from random insertions of the Mu-dl(ApRlac) phage by screening for induction of beta-galactosidase activity {{in the presence of}} methyl methanesulfonate. Genetic analysis reveals that these <b>fusions</b> resulted from insertion of Mu-dl(ApRlac) into two regions of the chromosome. One region (aidA) is near his and, based on phenotypic effects, appears to represent insertion into the alkA gene. The other region (aidB) is in the 92. 3 - to 98 -min region, which harbors no previously identified genes involved in repair of alkylation damage. The aidB <b>fusions</b> caused increased resistance to alkylating agents and caused little or no change in the biological effects of adaptation to alkylating agents. Unlike the aidA <b>fusions,</b> aidB <b>fusions</b> showed increased beta-galactosidase activity in untreated cells in a growth phase-dependent fashion. The ada- 5 mutation, which blocks expression of the adaptive response, decreased induction of beta-galactosidase activity in both aidA and aidB <b>fusions</b> after alkylation treatments. Thus, both aidA and aidB share with adaptive response a common regulatory mechanism involving the ada gene.

40|$|Poly(3 -hydroxybutyrate) (PHB) {{granules}} {{are covered}} by a surface layer consisting of mainly phasins and other PHB granule-associated proteins (PGAPs). Phasins are small amphiphilic proteins that determine the number and size of accumulated PHB granules. Five phasin proteins (PhaP 1 to PhaP 5) are known for Ralstonia eutropha. In this study, we identified three additional potential phasin genes (H 16 _B 1988, H 16 _B 2296, and H 16 _B 2326) by inspection of the R. eutropha genome for sequences with “phasin 2 motifs. ” To determine whether the corresponding proteins represent true PGAPs, <b>fusions</b> with eYFP (enhanced yellow fluorescent protein) were constructed.

All <b>fusions</b> were investigated in wild-type and PHB-negative backgrounds. Colocalization with PHB granules was found for all PhaC variants and for PhaP 1 to PhaP 5. Addi-tionally, eYFP <b>fusions</b> with H 16 _B 1988 and H 16 _B 2326 colocalized with PHB. <b>Fusions</b> of H 16 _B 2296 with eYFP, however, did not colocalize with PHB granules but did colocalize with the nucleoid region.
