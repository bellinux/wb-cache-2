For a fuller understanding of the physiological economy of the vitamin, some insight also into the modes of disappearance of the substance is <b>indispensable.</b> The accumulated <b>evidence</b> now permits us to present a picture both of in vivo synthesis of the vitamin by Phycomyces Blakesleeanus and of a mechanism by which the vitamin molecule is broken down by the latter organism...|$|R

Contemporary terrorist and guerrilla conflict countermeasures entail strewn networks of sensors that can be deployed and have self-organizing proficiency. In such applications, scuttle wires or cabling is generally not viable. A feeler set-up is essential that is swift and trouble-free to install and sustain. The imperative concern in wireless sensor scheme is the broadcast of messages to pull off an agreed message data and Quality of Services. QoS can be precise in terms of message delay, message due dates, bit blunder rates, packet crash, economic cost of transmission, broadcast power, etc. In this paper we surf {{through some of the}} congestion alleviation algorithm that assist the network in training the quality of services and the techniques that’s been used assuage congestio...|$|R
40|$|Fallibility is {{inherent}} in human cognition and so a system that will monitor performance is <b>indispensable.</b> While behavioral <b>evidence</b> for such a system derives from the finding that subjects slow down after trials {{that are likely to}} produce errors, the neural and behavioral characterization that enables such control is incomplete. Here, we report a specific role for dopamine/basal ganglia in response conflict by accessing deficits in performance monitoring in patients with Parkinson's disease. To characterize such a deficit, we used a modification of the oculomotor countermanding task to show that slowing down of responses that generate robust response conflict, and not post-error per se, is deficient in Parkinson's disease patients. Poor performance adjustment could be either due to impaired ability to slow RT subsequent to conflicts or due to impaired response conflict recognition. If the latter hypothesis was true, then PD subjects should show evidence of impaired error detection/correction, which was found to be the case. These results make a strong case for impaired performance monitoring in Parkinson's patients...|$|R

Therefore, this research aims to gauge the awareness of an e-zakat online system in the Selangor and also to examine the extent of utilisation of an online e-zakat among individual zakat payers using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. Although the model was reviewed by the prominent researchers, but, it still has a limited resource to explore the usefulness of using e-zakat online system. The primary data collection was carried out through a questionnaire survey. The questionnaire was distributed to the academicians in the Klang Valley. The results provide an intellectual challenge and contribute to knowledge {{in this area of}} user perceptions of IT utilisation and provide <b>indispensable</b> <b>evidence</b> of the necessity of improving the awareness and utilization of e-zakat online...|$|E
40|$|A new DS (Dempster-Shafer) {{combination}} {{method is}} presented in this paper. As data detected by a single sensor are characterized by not only fuzziness, but also partial reliability, the development of multi-sensor information fusion becomes extremely <b>indispensable.</b> The DS <b>evidence</b> theory is {{an effective means of}} information fusion, which can not only deal with the uncertainty and inconsistency of multi-sensor data, but also handle the inevitably ambiguity and instability under noise or possible interference. However, the application of DS evidence theory has some limitations when multi-sensor data are conflicting. To address this issue, the DS evidence theory is modified in this paper. Adopting the idea of cluster analysis, we firstly introduce the Lance distance function and spectral angle cosine function to revise original evidence separately before the combination of evidence. Then, based on the modifications of original evidence, an improved conflict redistribution strategy is ulteriorly raised to fuse multi-sensor information. Finally, the numerical simulation analyses demonstrate that the improvement of the DS evidence theory available in this paper overcomes the limitations of conventional DS evidence theory, and realizes more reliable fusion with multi-sensor conflicting information compared to the existing methods...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral {{intravenous}} {{access is}} essential {{in the treatment of}} most hospitalized patients. Establishing peripheral intravenous access can be difficult in certain patients such as patients who are obese, hypovolemic, intravenous drug users, and in the pediatric population. Patients with difficult access are exposed to an increased number of cannulation attempts, increased procedure times, and increased discomfort, which leads to an overall decrease in patient satisfaction. In addition, patients with difficult access may be delayed treatment due to unsuccessful cannulation attempts, which interferes with their healthcare. The research shows that ultrasound guidance to facilitate peripheral intravenous access is a proactive, <b>indispensable,</b> advanced, and <b>evidenced</b> based intervention that addresses patient needs and increases patient satisfaction. The purpose of this project is to propose a policy regarding the use of ultrasound guidance for peripheral intravenous access in order to address patient needs and increase patient satisfaction, with a focus on difficult access patients. The proposed policy is to educate nurses on how to implement a procedure in order to decrease the rate of unsuccessful cannulation attempts in hospitalized patients. In conclusion, the research supports ultrasound guidance for intravenous access as a simple technique that should be routinely practiced. Key words: ultrasound, intravenous, cannulation, policy, evidence-base...|$|R
