40|$|The {{application}} of static <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> {{was investigated in}} this thesis particularly for a composite plate configuration using piezoelectric actuators. A new electro-mechanically coupled mathematical model was developed for the analysis {{and is based on}} a third order displacement field coupled with a layerwise electric potential concept. This formulation, TODL, is then implemented into a finite element program. The mathematical model represents an improvement over existing formulations used to model intelligent structures using piezoelectric materials as actuators and sensors. The reason is TODL does not only account for the electro-mechanical coupling within the adaptive material, it also accounts for the full structural coupling in the entire structure due to the piezoelectric material being attached to the host structure. The other significant improvement of TODL is that it is applicable to structures which are relatively thick whereas existing models are based on thin beam / plate theories. Consequently, transverse shearing effects are automatically accounted for in TODL and unlike first order shear deformation theories, shear correction factors are not required. The second major section of this thesis uses the TODL formulation in static <b>shape</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Shape</b> <b>control</b> is defined here as the determination of <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> parameters, including actuation voltage and actuator orientation configuration, such that the structure that is activated using these parameters will conform {{as close as possible to}} the desired <b>shape.</b> Several <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> strategies and consequently algorithms were developed here. Initial investigations in <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> has revealed many interesting issues which have been used in later investigations to improve shape controllability and also led to the development of improved algorithms. For instance, the use of discrete actuator patches has led to greater shape controllability and the use of slopes and curvatures as additional control criteria have resulted in significant reduction in internal stresses. The significance of optimizing actuator orientation and its relation to piezoelectric anisotropy in improving shape controllability has also been presented. Thus the major facets of <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> has been brought together and the algorithms developed here represent a comprehensive strategy to perform static <b>shape</b> <b>control...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{discrete}} piezoelectric patches in Smart structures for <b>controlling</b> the <b>shape</b> {{has been of}} considerable interest in recent years. Such systems {{of one or more}} dimensions can nowadays be fully modeled with the help of finite element codes. The <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> of a smart structure using surface bonded piezoelectric patches acting as sensors and actuators is examined in this work. The finite element model based on Reddy's third order laminate theory has been developed for a beam having both ends fixed. The simulation results show that both the number and location of piezoelectric patches {{play an important role in}} <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> of the structure. The <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> of the beam improves as the number of sensor/actuator pairs. The location of the sensors/actuators on the control system is more critical than their number.

40|$|A unified {{smoke control}} method based on signed {{distance}} field Smoke <b>control</b> involves <b>shape</b> and path. A unified framework {{able to deal}} with both of them will enable animators to manipulate the shape and path of smoke animation more effectively. In this paper, we develop such a unified framework. With our approach, path <b>control,</b> <b>shape</b> <b>control,</b> and mixed control of both can be handled satisfactorily in the same framework. In order to develop this framework, we use a signed distance field to provide three control forces: path control force, boundary <b>control</b> force, and <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> force based on medial axis point clouds. The path control force makes the smoke move along the appointed route, the boundary control force keeps the smoke moving through specified regions only, and the <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> force enables the smoke to form various given <b>shapes.</b> The boundary <b>control</b> force and the <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> force are two novel control forces developed in this paper.

40|$|<b>Shape</b> <b>control</b> of a {{structure}} with distributed piezoelectric actuators {{can be achieved}} through optimally selecting the loci, shapes and sizes of the piezoelectric actuators and choosing the electric fields applied to the actuators. <b>Shape</b> <b>control</b> can be categorised as either static or dynamic <b>shape</b> <b>control.</b> Whether it is a transient or gradual change, static or dynamic <b>shape</b> <b>control,</b> both aim to determine the loci, sizes, and shapes of piezoelectric actuators, and the applied voltages such that a desired structural shape is achieved effectively. This thesis is primarily concerned with establishing a finite element formulation for the general smart laminated composite plate structure, which is capable to analyse static and dynamic deformation using non-rectangular elements. The mechanical deformation of the smart composite plate is modelled using a third order plate theory, while the electric field is simulated based on a layer-wise theory. The finite element formulation for static and dynamics analysis is verified by comparing with available numerical results. Selected experiments have also been conducted to measure structural deformation and the experimental results are used to correlate {{with those of the}} finite element formulation for static analysis. In addition, the Linear Least Square (LLS) method is employed to study the effect of different piezoelectric actuator patch pattern on the results of error function, which is the least square error between the calculated and desired structural shapes in static structural <b>shape</b> <b>control.</b> The second issue of this thesis deals with piezoelectric actuator design optimisation (PADO) for quasi-static <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> by finding the applied voltage and the configuration of piezoelectric actuator patch to minimise error function, whereas the piezoelectric actuator configuration is defined based on the optimisation technique of altering nodal coordinates (size/shape optimisation) or eliminating inefficient elements in a structural mesh (topology optimisation). Several <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> algorithms are developed to improve the structural <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> by reducing the error function. Further development of the GA-based voltage and piezoelectric actuator design optimisation method includes the constraint handling, where the error function can be optimised subjected to energy consumption or other way around. The numerical examples are presented in order to verify that the proposed algorithms are applicable to quasi-static <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> based on voltage and piezoelectric actuator design optimisation (PADO) in terms of minimising the error function. The third issue is to use the present finite element formulation for a modal <b>shape</b> <b>control</b> and for controlling resonant vibration of smart composite plate structures. The controlled resonant vibration formulation is developed. Modal analysis and LLS methods are also employed to optimise the applied voltage to piezoelectric actuators for achieving the modal shapes. The Newmark direct time integration method is used to study harmonic excitation of smart structures. Numerical results are presented to induce harmonic vibration of structure with controlled magnitude via adjusting the damping and to verify the controlled resonant vibration formulation...|$|R

Analytical methods are often based on a simplification of <b>inclusion</b> <b>shapes</b> and potential theory, spherical harmonic functions, etc. Many exact and approximate closed-form solutions have been derived by such methods for materials having a linear behavior [1 – 7]. However, if the microstructure is known in all its complexity, numerical methods must be used.
