Williamson spent most of the 1970s working on his own credited strip, another Raymond creation, Secret Agent X-9. The following decade, he became known for his work adapting Star Wars films to comic books and newspaper strips.

5|$|Paul Geerts {{joined the}} Studio in 1968, where he at first {{worked as an}} artist on the German Jerom comics. Already in 1969, he {{replaced}} De Rop as the main <b>inker</b> for Suske en Wiske. Geerts also drew Vandersteens attention when he proposed a few scenario's for Jerom, and in 1971 {{he made his first}} story for Suske en Wiske. From 1972 on, he became the main creator of the flagship series Suske en Wiske, which he continued until the late 1990s. De Rop and Goossens again became the main inkers, with Geerts responsible for the stories and the pencil art. In these years, Suske en Wiske reached its peak popularity, and the older stories now were republished in colours in the main series. In 1975 and 1976, the Dutch television broadcast six puppet movies with new Suske en Wiske stories. They were very successful and sales of new albums reached over 200,000 copies. The merchandising business boomed as well, and commercial comics were one of the main new jobs for the Studio.|$|E

25|$|Captain Britain {{originally}} {{appeared in}} {{the first issue of}} Captain Britain Weekly (cover-dated the week ending October 13, 1976), an anthology comic published exclusively in the United Kingdom by the Marvel Comics imprint known as Marvel UK.

25|$|Byrne penciled the six-issue DC Universe {{crossover}} miniseries Legends (Nov. 1986 – May 1987) {{during this}} time. He wrote and drew two monthly Superman titles with the hero's present-day adventures: a new Superman title beginning with issue #1 (January 1987) and Action Comics, in which, beginning with issue #584, Superman {{teamed up with}} other DC characters. The original Superman book was renamed The Adventures of Superman starting with issue #424 and was initially written by Marv Wolfman and drawn by Jerry Ordway, but the writing chores were taken over by Byrne after a year from issues #436–442 and 444. As 1988 marked the 50th anniversary year of Superman's creation, Byrne did more Superman-related projects while working on the core Superman monthly titles at the same time: he wrote the prestige format graphic novel, Superman: The Earth Stealers and three separate four-issue miniseries: The World of Krypton, The World of Metropolis, and The World of Smallville. He supplied the cover art for the March 14, 1988 issue of Time magazine and an interior spread featuring Superman, where his pencils were inked by Ordway. After his initial run on the Superman titles from 1986-1988, Byrne would make a return as a guest <b>inker</b> on Adventures of Superman Annual #2 and Superman #50 in 1990.
