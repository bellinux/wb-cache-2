40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{seasonal}} variations in habitat selection and abundance of Ciconiiformes species in four foraging habitats (rivers, channels, connected and disconnected lagoons) on the upper Paraná River floodplain, Brazil, and to conduct the surveys of wading birds in 2002 and 2003. The largest number of species and highest abundances of most species were observed in the connected lagoons. Snowy Egrets (Egretta thula), Wood Storks (Mycteria americana), Roseate Spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), and Jabirus (<b>Jabiru</b> <b>mycteria)</b> frequently used connected lagoons (habitat with the highest fish abundance) and abandoned the areas during floods, suggesting that they were able to find high quality patches for foraging. Cocoi Herons (Ardea cocoi), Great Egrets (Ardea alba), and Rufescent Tiger-Herons (Tigrisoma lineatum) used habitats with lower fish abundance and did not totally abandon these areas during floods, suggesting they were not dependent on high quality patches. Differences in foraging techniques and social behavior explained the difference between the two groups. The results showed that opportunism did not totally explain the foraging habitat selection and in low water level seasons there were higher differences in foraging behavior among the species...|$|R
40|$|The <b>jabiru</b> stork, <b>Jabiru</b> <b>mycteria</b> (Lichtenstein, 1819), a large, long-legged {{wading bird}} {{occurring}} in lowland wetlands from southern Mexico to northern Argentina, is considered endangered {{in a large}} portion of its distribution range. We conducted aerial surveys to estimate the number of jabiru active nests in the Brazilian Pantanal (140, 000 km²) in September of 1991 - 1993, 1998, 2000 - 2002, and 2004. Corrected densities of active nests were regressed against the annual hydrologic index (AHI), an index of flood extension in the Pantanal based on the water level of the Paraguay River. Annual nest density was a non-linear function of the AHI, modeled by the equation 6. 5 · 10 - 8 · AHI 1. 99 (corrected r² = 0. 72, n = 7). We applied this model to the AHI between 1900 and 2004. The results indicate that the number of jabiru nests may have varied from about 220 in 1971 to more than 23, 000 in the nesting season of 1921, and the estimates for our study period (1991 to 2004) averaged about 12, 400 nests. Our model indicates that the inter-annual variations in flooding extent can determine dramatic changes in the number of active jabiru nests. Since the jabiru stork responds negatively to drier conditions in the Pantanal, direct human-induced changes in the hydrological patterns, as well as the effects of global climate change, may strongly jeopardize the population in the region...|$|R
40|$|This chapter reviews recent {{developments}} in ornithological studies of the birds of the Pantanal. In recent years, publications from the Pantanal region increased considerably. Among those are several dissertations completed within the Pantanal Ecology Project (PEP) of the Federal University of Mato Grosso and Max-Planck-Institute, Working Group on Tropical Ecology, Germany. Bird inventories are now available from {{most parts of the}} Pantanal, though intensive and long-term sampling effort is required to obtain nearly complete species lists. However, for many rare or migratory species of the Pantanal there is still a lack of well-documented records and of informations concerning their status in the Pantanal. Studies on biology and ecology of Pantanal species are still limited, while most conservation-related publications concern two species: the Hyacinth Macaw (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) and the <b>Jabiru</b> Stork (<b>Jabiru</b> <b>mycteria).</b> The Pantanal has higher avian species richness than adjacent landscapes, which is mainly due to diverse forest bird communities, not much inferior in species numbers to Amazonian forests. The Pantanal is under the double infl uence of pronounced climatic seasons and a monomodal floodpulse, both of which show irregular long-term oscillations. This causes dynamic responses of the bird communities, which are only partially understood. The best-known feature is the breeding of aquatic birds, which is triggered by certain stages of the floodpulse. A considerable part of the avifauna are migratory species, but the complex migration strategies of Pantanal birds are still poorly known. More long-term studies on the ecology and dynamics of local bird communities, as well as bird migration studies including satellite tracking, will be necessary to better understand the avifauna of the Pantanal...|$|R

The pendant inflatable pouch connects to the air passages and is not connected to the digestive tract. The exact function is unknown, but it is not involved in food storage as was sometimes believed.

The only possible confusable species in the region is the smaller lesser adjutant (Leptoptilos javanicus), which lacks a pouch, prefers wetland habitats, has a lighter grey skull cap, a straighter edge to the upper mandible and lacks the contrast between the grey secondary coverts and the dark wings.|$|R
