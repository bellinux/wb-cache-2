The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) Viable bacterial counts were decreased about 90 % in ultraviolet treated water, but viable fungi counts did not decrease {{to the same}} degree as the bacterial counts. 2) The eying rate and hatching rate were about 20 % higher in the ultraviolet treated <b>hatching</b> <b>tray</b> than the untreated control, the fungi infection rate of the egg decreased about 19 %. 3) Utilization of disinfection of hatchery water supply by ultraviolet irradiation was expected to increase the eying rate and the hatching rate...|$|E
40|$|A field level {{study was}} carried out to acquire {{experience}} on seed production of mono-sex tilapia at Reliance aqua farms Ukilbari, Boilor, Trishal, Mymensingh. The duration {{of this study was}} 3 months (01 / 04 / 10 to 30 / 06 / 10). Reliance Aqua Farm is occupied 20 acre area of which 1. 5 acre is hatchery complex and 18. 5 acre pond area. They use 40 hatching jar, 120 <b>hatching</b> <b>tray,</b> 12 cistern and 300 hapa in the hatchery complex for seed production. The size of the breeding hapa is 50 ft× 25 ft× 3 ft and each hapa contain 50 male and 150 female at 1 : 3 (male:female) ratio. A single female can produce 1000 - 1500 eggs/cycle. They use hormone in feed for sex reversal (production of all male tilapia) from the first feeding stage. 17 α –methyl testosterone hormone used at 60 mg/kg feed which is dissolved with 95 % ethanol solution. 150 mg ethanol is used for per kg feed preparation. Mechanical method is used for hormone mixing in this farm, and then the feed are dried under room temperature. Commercial mega feed is used. After sex-reversal, fingerlings are generally nursed to an advanced size before they are stocked into grow-out facilities. This procedure increases survival in the grow-out stage and utilizes growing space more efficiently. Sex-reversed fingerlings are stocked at approximately 20 - 25 fish/m 2 in small ponds and cultured for 45 - 50 days to an average size of 15 - 20 g. Then Marketing is done at three size grades (small/. 60 TK, medium/. 80 TK, large/ 1 TK) ...|$|E

50|$|In 1940 the Trent Fishery Board, a {{precursor}} of the Trent River Authority, opened the Calverton Fish Farm {{with the aim}} of breeding thousands of fish to stock rivers and still waters around the country. The farm consisted of sheds containing <b>hatching</b> <b>trays</b> and sixty-three ponds in nine units of seven ponds each. The water supply to the ponds was from a spring, by means of a borehole five hundred feet deep. In December 1941, some 12,000 fish, including carp and bream, were brought from the lake at Highfields park. The farm was already hatching out salmon and trout, and hoped to be fully stocked by 1942.|$|R

40|$|Avaliaram-se os efeitos da idade das matrizes leves e do período de armazenamento dos ovos sobre o rendimento de incubação. Foram utilizados 7. 224 ovos da linhagem Dekalb, distribuídos de acordo com delineamento {{experimental}} inteiramente casualizado, sendo a altura de bandeja uma covariável. Os tratamentos foram definidos pelas idades das matrizes (32 e 57 semanas de idade) e o período de armazenamento dos ovos (três, cinco e sete dias), totalizando seis tratamentos com 14 repetições. A idade das aves influenciou o peso do ovo. Houve aumento na perda de peso dos ovos das matrizes de 32 e 57 semanas de idade, durante o armazenamento (10, 48 e 14, 16 %, respectivamente) e na transferência (10, 40 e 12, 07 %, respectivamente). Verificou-se maior taxa de eclosão (86, 90 %) em ovos produzidos pelas matrizes novas. Independentemente da idade da matriz, à medida que aumentou o período de armazenamento, houve diminuição na taxa de eclosão dos ovos férteis (86, 06 e 82, 39 %, para as matrizes de 32 e 57 semanas de idade, respectivamente). As matrizes com 57 semanas de idade produziram pintos mais pesados e com menor relação peso do pinto/peso do ovo. The {{effects of}} ages of light breeder hens and storage period of hatchabe eggs on the incubation efficiency were evaluated. A total of 7, 224 Dekalb hatching eggs were assigned {{according to the}} sample random design, and the <b>hatching</b> <b>tray</b> height was considered a co-variable. The treatments were defined according to the breeder hens ages (32 and 57 -week-old) and the period of storage of eggs (three, five, and seven days), with 14 replications. The age of the hen affected {{the weight of the}} eggs. There was loss of weight of the eggs of 32 and 57 -week-old breeder hens during storage (10. 48 and 14. 16 %, respectively) and transference (10. 40 and 12. 07 %, respectively) according to the aging of the breeder hen. Eggs produced by the younger breeder hens had a higher hatching rate; however, no matter the age of the breeder hen, there was a decrease of the hatching rate of fertile eggs (86. 06 and 82. 39 %, for the 32 and 57 -week-old breeder hens, respectively) whenever the storage period was increased. The 57 -weekold breeder hens produced heavier chicks and lower chick/egg weight coefficient...|$|E
40|$|PIVOTAL {{displacement}} or "turning " is {{a purely}} physical factor, necessary during incubation for the normal develop-ment and hatchability of all domestic fowl embryos. In {{order to provide}} the re-quired stimulus, modern commercial in-cubators are so constructed that the trays of eggs can be tilted {{back and forth through}} a 90 degree arc (i. e., 45 degrees each way from horizontal). It is common procedure to candle the eggs and transfer them to <b>hatching</b> <b>trays</b> on the 18 th day. If shaking agitation could be substi-tuted for conventional turning, several advantages would ensue: (1) eggs could be incubated and hatched in the same tray; (2) labor costs resulting from the 18 -day handling would be eliminated; and (3) incubator space could be utilized more efficiently. There are, however, several experi-mental observations recorded in the literature which counsel against the work-ability of such a scheme. Stiles and Wat-terson (1937) described in rather complete detail the effects of jarring on developing embryos. A 490 gm. weight was dropped a distance of 6 cm. onto a table top upon which the incubator rested. The shocks were delivered at the rate of 15 blows per minute at 15 minute intervals. Only one chick was hatched from 155 eggs s...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of the {{interior}} view of a fish hatchery, California, ca. 1910. Vats (or tanks?), some covered, are lined up in rows across the room. The vat in the foreground has some type of filtering device attached to it. Lined along the walls are pipes where more filter devices (or water pumping devices?) can be seen pouring water into the vats. Dozens of glass containers, filled with fish specimens, sit on a table {{near the center of}} the room. Other hatchery devices are seen scattered throughout the room. Nets hang from the roof. In the center of the room hangs a sign that reads: "California Northwestern fish hatchery, [ [...] . ]y Co. "; "The hatchery still houses the initial stages of the process, where fertilized eggs are placed in plastic <b>hatching</b> <b>trays</b> and incubated with a continuous flow of fresh water to provide adequate oxygen. In the 19 th and early 20 th centuries, tall glass hatching jars were used for this process. Today, hatched fish are kept in rearing troughs. When the fish reach 3 to 4 inches they are transferred to one of the ponds. In the spring fish are distributed to the State's waterways. When this was done by train and wagon, fish were transported in "fish cans" with perforated inserts for ice that provided oxygen to the fish as it melted. Today, they are distributed by trucks in large installed tanks. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
40|$|Eggshell {{conductance}} (G) and incubator ventilation (VENT) were {{hypothesized to}} affect embryo viability {{and growth of}} poults following hatching. Nearly 6, 000 eggs were weighed {{on the day of}} oviposition to determine eggs of like weight but of different G. From the 6, 000 eggs, 4, 000 were selected that were within 2 standard deviations of the mean. The eggs were randomly divided equally between two incubator cabinets. One cabinet operated with a closed VENT and a second operated with it open. At the completion of the 24 th day of development, all eggs were weighed a second time to determine eggshell G. Three groups were formed at that time exhibiting high (Hi), average (Avg) or low (Low) G. The eggs within each group were placed into <b>hatching</b> <b>trays</b> of 100 eggs each and placed into he same incubation cabinet for hatching. Weights were recorded for cardiac, hepatic and intestinal tissues, and blood was collected from each treatment. The tissues were subsequently assayed for energy substrates. Embryo viability was noted and growth was observed up to 6 wk of age. More embryos in eggs of Hi or Avg G survived than did those in Low G eggs, but neonates at 6 wk from Hi G eggs weighed less than those from Avg or Low G eggs. Low G embryos had reduced heart, liver and intestinal weight and function. Embryo thyroid hormone concentrations were elevated in Hi G eggs but suppressed by Low G and Closed VENT. Thus, in the developmental process of the embryonic turkey, G may determine energy balance and maturity of each hatchling and may affect its survival and growth rates following hatching...|$|R
