5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought {{to get them to}} work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned in his opening address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E
5|$|They stamp {{their feet}} {{in time to the}} hornpipe – that is until I whip up the {{orchestra}} to a fierce accelerando which leaves behind all those whose stamping technique is not of the very finest quality. I like to win by two bars, if possible; but sometimes have to be content with a bar and a half. It is good fun, and I enjoy <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as they.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} the manuscript for Casino Royale, Fleming showed the manuscript {{to his friend}} (and later editor) William Plomer to read. Plomer liked it and submitted it to the publishers, Jonathan Cape, who did not like <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much.</b> Cape finally published it in 1953 {{on the recommendation of}} Fleming's older brother Peter, an established travel writer. Between 1953 and 1966, two years after his death, twelve novels and two short-story collections were published, with the last two books – The Man with the Golden Gun and Octopussy and The Living Daylights – published posthumously. All the books were published in the UK through Jonathan Cape.|$|E

5|$|Gautier was not {{satisfied}} with this story. It was basically a succession of dances with one moment of drama at its end. He had no experience writing ballet scenarios so he called upon Vernoy de St. Georges, {{a man who had}} written many ballet librettos. St. Georges liked Gautier's basic idea of the frail young girl and the Wilis. He wrote the story of Giselle as it is known today in three days, and sent it to Léon Pillet, the director of the Paris Opéra. Pillet needed a good story to introduce Grisi to the Paris public. He found that story in Giselle. Grisi liked <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as Pillet did, so Giselle was put into production at once.|$|E
5|$|My love is {{stronger}} than it's ever been, even though my love may seem to have diminished. I do not love less, even though I don't show <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much.</b> Love becomes a commodity when it's spoken of too highly and too frequently. I used to sing my praises very frequently when our love was new, like the nightingale which sings {{in the summer and}} stops at summers end. It's not that the summer is less pleasant for the nightingale, it's simply that the songs of other birds fill the air, and when things become common, they become less dear. It's for this reason, I, like the nightingale, have stopped writing. I do not wish my poems to become boring.|$|E
5|$|The {{harmonium}} {{was out of}} {{tune with}} everything. It wasn't even in tune with itself. She insisted on playing it on everything {{so we had to}} figure out ways to separate her voice from <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible and then find instrumental voices that would be compatible with the harmonium track... As an arranger you're usually trying to take the songs and put a structure on them, but what I thought was valuable was when you took the centre out of the track and worked around the central core of the tonality and changes. That left you with a sort of floating free-form tapestry behind what she was doing, which is when things became more abstract.|$|E

5|$|The project's {{finalization}} {{lasted for}} two years due to {{the intention of the}} team behind it to improve <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible. According to Gočeva and the producer Micevski, the group's members' acquaintance with each other helped them in setting the right musical direction with the recording of Makedonsko Devojče 2. Musically, the album is similar to its predecessor; the songs are characterized by elements of Macedonian traditional music, but are adapted to a modern style which is contemporary {{at the time of the}} release of the album, thus intertwining pop and jazz elements. The lyrics cover emotional states of sadness, happiness, love and longing experienced by a mellow woman. The songs were written and composed specifically for Gočeva, taking into account her wide vocal range and musical versatility; all of them are sang without using any backing vocals.|$|E
5|$|She often {{bears the}} brunt of Victor's temper due to muddled misunderstandings and {{in part due to}} her aloof nature. One such {{occasion}} saw Victor asking her to pick up a suit of his from the dry-cleaners, only for her to return with a gorilla costume. Another occasion saw her persuading Victor to take on a dog whose owner had just died. Victor spent time building a kennel in the garden and when Mrs Warboys arrives with the dog, she forgets to mention that the dog is stuffed - much to Victor and Margaret's consternation. On another occasion she won a competition where the prize was either to earn £500 or to have a life-size waxwork model made of herself, which had to be delivered to the Meldrews' house; she chose the waxwork. As it turned out, she hated <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as Victor and Margaret did, and the waxwork ended up in the dustbin.|$|E
25|$|Rhodes opposed native liquor {{trafficking}} and suppressed it {{entirely on the}} diamond mines {{at the risk of}} offending some of his supporters among the brandy-farmers of the western provinces. He also restricted <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he could on native reserves and territories. Nevertheless, liquor trafficking continued on colonial farms and to some extent on in native territory and reserves. The Khoikhoi were particularly fond of the drink as they had been almost completely demoralised from their military losses.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} little woman. [...] "I can't {{find time to}} look after cattle, and I'm not used to <b>it.</b> <b>It's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I {{can do to keep}} going in the house." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>It's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> to state, you begin. If you please, I {{will finish}} the sentence. <b>It</b> is <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> to state--not that I wish to press it or even recall it, {{for it is}} of no use now, and my only wish {{is to make the}} best of {{existing}} circumstances--that from the first to the last I always objected to this match of yours, and at a very late period yielded a most unwilling consent to it.' ...|$|R

25|$|Laurents {{was horrified}} {{when he saw}} the first rough cut of the film. He thought there were a few good scenes, and some good moments in bad scenes, but overall {{he thought it was a}} badly photographed jumbled mess lacking coherence. Both stars {{appeared}} to be playing themselves more often than their characters, and Streisand often used a grand accent that Laurents felt hurt her performance. Pollack admitted the film was not good, accepted full responsibility for its problems, and apologized for his behavior. The following day he retreated to the editing room to improve <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible. Laurents felt the changes made it better but never as good as it could have been.|$|E
25|$|Fronsac is {{initially}} {{skeptical about the}} beast's existence, since survivors describe <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> larger than any wolf he has ever seen. However, by studying the bite size on {{a victim of the}} beast, he deduces that it must weigh more than 500lb (227kg). Captain Duhamel, an army officer leading the hunt for the beast, has killed dozens of ordinary wolves, but has not come close to the actual killer. While staying in Gévaudan, Fronsac romances Marianne de Morangias, the daughter of a local count, whose brother, Jean-François, was also an avid hunter and a world traveler, before losing one arm to a lion in Africa. Fronsac is also intrigued by Sylvia, an Italian courtesan at the local brothel.|$|E
25|$|For {{listeners}} {{unfamiliar with}} experimental music, Bailey's distinctive style can be challenging. Its most noticeable feature is {{what appears to}} be its extreme discontinuity, often from note to note: there may be enormous intervals between consecutive notes, and rather than aspiring to the consistency of timbre typical of most guitar-playing, Bailey interrupts <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible: four consecutive notes, for instance, may be played on an open string, a fretted string, via harmonics, and using a nonstandard technique such as scraping the string with the pick or plucking below the bridge. Many of the key features of his music—radical discontinuity, the self-contained brevity of each gesture, an attraction to wide intervals—owe much to Bailey's early fascination with Anton Webern, an influence most audible on Bailey's earliest available recordings, Pieces for Guitar (1966–67, issued on Tzadik).|$|E
6000|$|... "Why don't she hire a valet de place, {{and talk}} to him? I'd hire one myself for her. It {{would be a good}} deal cheaper for me. <b>It's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> I can do to stand this weather <b>as</b> <b>it</b> is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If you {{are going}} to be as {{exacting}} as that with people," [...] Maxwell returned, [...] "{{you are going}} to disappoint yourself frightfully; and if you insist, you will make them hate you.

500|$|About Maryland, Nevada {{head coach}} Chris Ault said, [...] "Their offense {{to me is}} very balanced. They can run the ball and do a good job.

500|$|At {{the start}} of the game, the player's score is set to the value of 50; their goal is to {{increase}} <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible, for the maximum score of 307. This is done by performing certain actions, finding new areas, solving puzzles, and by finding and keeping treasures and valuable items. In exchange for some of their score, the player can receive hints or get resurrected following an in-game death. The player is ranked in accordance with their score: they start as a [...] "clumsy rookie", and eventually become an [...] "expert on Småland houses". Upon finishing the game, the player gets inducted into the cottage council.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} the {{compilation}} was released, Madonna was riding a wave of publicity {{as a result of}} the film Evita and her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes. Bray decided to cash-in the publicity for the release, although he knew that Madonna would never approve of the album. He said in an interview with Extra that Madonna would receive royalties for the release, and added [...] "There's nothing in these tapes that would be embarrassing, and just hoping that she would like <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as we do." [...] In the European countries, the album was re-titled as In the Beginning, featuring different artwork, and a re-arranged track list.|$|E

6000|$|... "They ain't exactly THAT," [...] said Roberts, {{still with}} embarrassment. [...] "The fact is--ye see--the thing points THIS way: they ain't {{no right to}} be here, and <b>it's</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> <b>as</b> my place is worth if it leaks out that they are." ...|$|R
500|$|Recognizing McKinley's potential, the Democrats, {{whenever}} they controlled the Ohio legislature, sought to gerrymander or redistrict {{him out of}} office. In 1878, McKinley faced election in a redrawn 17th district; he won anyway, causing Hayes to exult, [...] "Oh, the good luck of McKinley! He was gerrymandered out and then beat the gerrymander! We enjoyed <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as he did." [...] After the 1882 election, McKinley was unseated on an election contest by a near party-line House vote. Out of office, he was briefly depressed by the setback, but soon vowed to run again. The Democrats again redistricted Stark County for the 1884 election; McKinley was returned to Congress anyway.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the first}} film was commended for leaving the shark to the {{imagination}} until {{two thirds of the}} way through, Szwarc felt that they should show <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as possible because the dramatic [...] "first image of it coming out of the water" [...] in {{the first film}} could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film's Hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented {{that there was no way}} that they were ever going to duplicate the original's effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.|$|E
500|$|GameSpot, {{in their}} {{review of the}} game, said that Katamari Forever [...] "carries on the series' {{tradition}} of wildly catchy soundtracks" [...] {{and said that the}} remixes of the older songs [...] "sound terrific". PALGN concurred, calling it a [...] "great soundtrack". The album was received warmly by reviewers such as Square Enix Music Online, who said that it was full of [...] "fresh, diverse, and often downright weird remixes". Describing <b>it</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> more of a spiritual successor to the original game's soundtrack than the prior sequels, they said that it kept the [...] "upbeat, humorous, and sentimental feel" [...] of the songs in the original while taking them in new directions. The album reached #158 on the Japanese Oricon charts.|$|E
