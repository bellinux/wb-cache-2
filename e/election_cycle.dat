5|$|The Democrats lost {{seats in}} the Senate in the 1950 <b>election</b> <b>cycle,</b> and party leader Ernest McFarland removed Clinton Anderson as {{chairman}} of the Senate Democratic Reelection Committee, replacing him with Clements for the 1952 <b>election</b> <b>cycle.</b> Clements advocated better cooperation between his committee and the Democratic National Committee in 1952. However, Republicans won the presidency and both houses of Congress in 1952, and the Democratic National Committee talked openly of disbanding the Reelection Committee. Clements instead advised that his committee's responsibilities be expanded and that its activities become year-round rather than seasonal.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, Clements was {{appointed}} Democratic party whip, serving under party leader Lyndon B. Johnson. In addition, he retained his {{chairmanship of the}} Senate Democratic Reelection Committee for the 1954 <b>election</b> <b>cycle.</b> He and Democratic National Committee chair Stephen Mitchell agreed that the two committees should conduct separate fund-raising operations {{in order to maximize}} donations for Democratic candidates. Democrats regained control of the Senate in 1954, and Clements instituted the practice of having his committee provide transition services for freshman senators. That practice continues today.|$|E

On October 27, 2008, he officially announced his candidacy for Governor of Alabama in an interview with CNN, stating that he planned to run in the 2014 <b>election</b> <b>cycle,</b> but he began to back off the idea in a November 24, 2009 interview on The Jay Leno Show.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the new Congress in 1977, Mathias was in line for several potential committee promotions to ranking member. However, Mathias' outspoken criticism of the party in the previous <b>election</b> <b>cycle</b> aroused enmity amongst his colleagues. On the Judiciary Committee, Mathias had the most seniority of any other member except Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who already held another ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee. Only one ranking membership was allowed per senator, so Thurmond resigned his ranking membership on the Armed Services Committee to circumvent Mathias serving as ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. Mathias was also prevented from assuming leadership positions on the Government Operations Committee following a power struggle, and on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. On the latter subcommittee, Mathias had more seniority than any other member. However, party leaders were uneasy with the idea of allowing Mathias to team up with liberal Democrat and subcommittee chairman Birch Bayh, and voted instead for William L. Scott as ranking member.|$|E
5|$|McCain's oft-cited {{strengths}} as {{a presidential}} candidate for 2008 included national name recognition, sponsorship of major lobbying and campaign finance reform initiatives, his ability to reach across the aisle, his well-known military service and experience as a POW, his experience from the 2000 presidential campaign, and an expectation that he would capture Bush's top fundraisers. During the 2006 <b>election</b> <b>cycle,</b> McCain had attended 346events and helped raise more than $10.5million on behalf of Republican candidates. McCain also became more willing to ask business and industry for campaign contributions, while maintaining that such contributions would not affect any official decisions he would make. Despite being considered the front-runner for the nomination by pundits as 2007 began, McCain was in second place behind former Mayor of New York City Rudy Giuliani in national Republican polls as the year progressed.|$|E
