500|$|... "Harlem Shake" [...] {{begins with}} a sample of a voice {{shouting}} [...] "con los terroristas", a Spanish phrase which translates to [...] "with the terrorists" [...] in English. Although listeners assumed it was a female voice, the sample was taken from the 2006 reggaeton song [...] "Maldades" [...] by Héctor Delgado, who often used the line as a refrain on his other songs. In 2010, the recorded phrase was used by Philadelphia disc jockeys Skinny Friedman and DJ Apt One on their remix of Gregor Salto's dance track [...] "Con Alegría". Baauer said he found the vocal sample from an unidentified source on the Internet. The sampled voice is followed by building synths and snares, and a syncopated sub-bass sound before another voice commands listeners to [...] "do the Harlem shake". The line was sampled from Plastic Little's 2001 hip hop song [...] "Miller Time", which Baauer sampled after having a friend play it for him and [...] " [...] stuck in my head for a while". Plastic Little member Jayson Musson said his line was inspired by a fist-fight that he ended by performing the harlem shake dance move: [...] "This was my first fight and I didn’t know how to properly 'end' a fight, so I <b>just</b> <b>smiled</b> at him and did the Harlem shake, blood gushing from glass cuts on my face. The other kid, I guess not wanting to fight anymore, or maybe not wanting to fight someone who just danced at him, got on his skateboard and took off without his shoes." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tsuchiya {{has also}} confessed that when drunk, she often picked on [...] "fatter" [...] models herself, {{especially}} foreigners {{who came to}} work for fashion magazines such as Elle, Vogue, SPUR and Pre Numéro, publications she considered sub-stream. These models, unable to understand Japanese, were oblivious to Tsuchiya's abuse and always <b>just</b> <b>smiled</b> back to whatever what she said. Tsuchiya would also often speak to them in English using offensive words related to obesity, as many models in their teens do, and would often further assault them when they reacted negatively to her verbal abuse.|$|E

[...] "Despite the fact that I'm sentenced to 16 life sentences I know that we will become free from Israeli occupation and then I will also be free from the prison," [...] she said.

2500|$|At Loudon in the July race, Busch {{started in}} the front row {{alongside}} former teammate Brad Keselowski. After brother Kyle led 53 laps of the event, Kurt dominated the race leading for 102 laps and driving in the top ten. With about 75 laps left in the race Busch again crashed with Ryan Newman. Busch's crew fixed the car before the restart and got back on the track, but finished about 20 laps down. Kyle Busch, who finished in second spot in the race, stood up for Kurt as well as drivers such as David Gilliland, Danica Patrick and Kenseth. With his brother, Kyle spent the post-race ceremonies insulting Ryan Newman for his part in the accident. Kyle said to reporters [...] "I really hate that Kurt got tore up. He was the class of the race but man just stupidity. Ryan Newman is the biggest stupid idiot out there and is a big ogre. But we are all glad that he is out of a job." [...] It had been previously announced at nearly {{the same time as the}} post-race ceremonies, that Ryan Newman would not be a part of Stewart-Haas Racing in 2014. Newman <b>just</b> <b>smiled</b> when he heard these words and said [...] "They are both a heck of talent and both are good kids off the track but when they are on the track they are both not so bright. We'll leave it at that." ...|$|E
