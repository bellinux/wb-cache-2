5|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{effects of}} the menstrual cycle on alcohol consumption have found mixed evidence. However, some evidence suggests that individuals consume more alcohol during the luteal stage, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> these individuals are heavy drinkers or {{have a family history}} of alcohol abuse.|$|E
5|$|The {{party had}} no strong {{economic}} preferences, and generally supported a mixed economy. While it supported privatisation and tax reductions for small and medium businesses, it also sometimes supported protectionism and defended the welfare state, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> {{allocated to the}} native Flemish population.|$|E
5|$|Because {{glass is}} very brittle in its solid state, {{it is often}} prone to {{cracking}} upon heating and cooling, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> the heating and cooling are uneven. This is because the brittleness of glass {{does not allow for}} uneven thermal expansion. Glass that has been welded will usually need to be cooled very slowly and evenly through the glass transition, in a process called annealing, to relieve any internal stresses created by a temperature gradient.|$|E

5|$|In {{setting up}} {{protected}} reserves, efforts generally {{also have to}} be focused on the surrounding areas, as jaguars are unlikely to confine themselves to the bounds of a reservation, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> the population is increasing in size. Human attitudes in the areas surrounding reserves and laws and regulations to prevent poaching are essential to make conservation areas effective.|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} {{through much of}} its range, but in the northernmost areas it is rare, since it is {{vulnerable}} to hard winters, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus. In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Many {{animals are}} highly {{sensitive}} to motion; for example, frogs readily detect small moving dark spots but ignore stationary ones. Therefore, motion signals {{can be used}} to defeat camouflage. Moving objects with disruptive camouflage patterns remain harder to identify than uncamouflaged objects, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> other similar objects are nearby, even though they are detected, so motion does not completely 'break' camouflage.|$|E

5|$|Measurements of {{barometric}} {{pressure and the}} pressure tendency (the change of pressure over time) {{have been used in}} forecasting since the late 19th century. The larger the change in pressure, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> more than , the larger the change in weather can be expected. If the pressure drop is rapid, a low pressure system is approaching, and there is a greater chance of rain. Rapid pressure rises are associated with improving weather conditions, such as clearing skies.|$|E
5|$|Other {{tests that}} may {{assist in the}} {{diagnosis}} of hypopituitarism, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> no tumor is found on the MRI scan, are ferritin (elevated in hemochromatosis), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) levels (often elevated in sarcoidosis), and human chorionic gonadotropin (often elevated in tumor of germ cell origin). If a genetic cause is suspected, genetic testing may be performed.|$|E
5|$|Storm petrels {{face the}} same threats as other seabirds; in {{particular}} they are threatened by introduced species. The Guadalupe storm petrel was driven to extinction by feral cats, and introduced predators have also been responsible for declines in other species. Habitat degradation which limits nesting opportunities caused by introduced goats and pigs is also a problem, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> it increases competition from more aggressive burrowing petrels.|$|E

5|$|TCDD {{has never}} been {{produced}} commercially except as a pure chemical for scientific research. It is, however, formed as a synthesis side product when producing certain chlorophenols or chlorophenoxy acid herbicides. It may also be formed along with other polychlorinated dibenzodioxins and dibenzofuranes in any burning, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> certain metal catalysts such as copper are present (see dioxins and dioxin-like compounds).|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of pneumothorax can be vague and inconclusive, especially {{in those with}} a small PSP; confirmation with medical imaging is usually required. In contrast, tension pneumothorax is a medical emergency and may be treated before imaging â€“ <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> there is severe hypoxia, very low blood pressure, or an impaired level of consciousness. In tension pneumothorax, X-rays are sometimes required if there is doubt about the anatomical location of the pneumothorax.|$|E

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of many red flags are poorly supported by evidence. The most useful for detecting a fracture are: older age, corticosteroid use, and significant trauma <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> {{it results in}} skin markings.

5|$|Young forests (trees <2 years old) {{are most}} at risk from ash falls {{and are likely to}} be {{destroyed}} by ash deposits >100 mm. Ash fall is unlikely to kill mature trees, but ash loading may break large branches during heavy ash falls (>500 mm). Defoliation of trees may also occur, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> there is a coarse ash component within the ash fall.|$|E
5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led {{to a decline in}} traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E

5|$|Beagle {{required}} {{large numbers}} of chronometers because some would inevitably break down on long voyages and the chronometers were essential for {{the mission of the}} ship. Further, the rates of all chronometers vary with time. Although this can be allowed for by interpolating between the regular rate checks, {{there is no guarantee that}} the changes are linear, and often they are not. Averaging the readings from a large number of chronometers, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> they are of a variety of types, will tend to cancel out such errors.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the match, much of the {{attention}} was placed on the weather forecast and the prospects of rain. In their 12 tour matches leading up to the Tests, Australia had been almost completely untroubled by the opposition except in the two matches against Yorkshire and Hampshire on rain-affected pitches. In these two matches they came close to defeat after heavy batting collapses before recovering to victory. It was thus thought that the toss could be of great importance, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> the team batting first had accumulated a substantial total by the time rain came. The match was the first Ashes Test to be played on English soil since the end of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Benfica began March with an away game in Braga. They lost 3â€“1 {{in their}} first league loss since December. They dropped to fourth place in the standings. On the {{following}} Saturday, Benfica visited Belenenses and lost {{for a second time}} in a row. A week later, Benfica received PaÃ§os de Ferreira at home. The match ended with a 3â€“2 win for the visitors and Benfica dropped to fifth place. They were now eleven points behind leader Boavista. In the last game of March, Benfica faced Campomaiorense on the road. With a 1â€“1 draw, the team avoided losing all of their matches in March. However, their need to get points was aggravated, <b>especially</b> <b>if</b> they wanted to qualify for the European competitions.|$|E
