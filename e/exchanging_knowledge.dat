40|$|Knowledge {{translation}} is underpinned by a dynamic and social <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> process {{but there are}} few descriptions of how this unfolds in practice settings. This has hampered attempts to produce realistic and useful models to help policymakers and researchers understand how <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> works. This paper reports the results of research which investigated the nature of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange.</b> We aimed to understand whether dynamic and fluid definitions of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> are valid and to produce a realistic, descriptive framework of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange.</b> Our research was informed by a realist approach. We embedded a knowledge broker within three service delivery teams across a large mental health organisation, each of whom was grappling with specific challenges. The knowledge broker participated in the team's problem-solving process and collected observational fieldnotes. We also interviewed the team members. Observational and interview data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively {{in order to determine}} and describe the nature of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> process in more detail. This enabled us to refine our conceptual framework of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange.</b> We found that <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> can be understood as a dynamic and fluid process which incorporates distinct forms of knowledge from multiple sources. Quantitative analysis illustrated that five broadly-defined components of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> (problem, context, <b>knowledge,</b> activities, use) can all be in play at any one time and do not occur in a set order. Qualitative analysis revealed a number of distinct themes which better described the nature of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange.</b> By shedding light on the nature of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange,</b> our findings problematise some of the linear, technicist approaches to knowledge translation. The revised model of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> which we propose here could therefore help to reorient thinking about <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> and act {{as a starting point for}} further exploration and evaluation of the <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> process...|$|R
40|$|<b>Knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> {{has been}} {{incorporated}} into the roles of universities and public sector research establishments (PSREs) in the UK alongside research and teaching. Universities and PSREs have spent much time ensuring that research ethics are managed effectively and {{much has been written}} about this. However, little research has been done to explore the ethical issues and questions which can arise in <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange.</b> This thesis seeks to address a gap in the ethics of universities and PSREs by exploring the ethics and values of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange.</b> Previous studies have considered the position of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> in universities and PSREs and academic involvement in it. Based on interviews with <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> practitioners, the thesis illuminates the interaction between <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> and CSR in universities and PSREs. The research finds links between the roles of universities and PSREs, the practice of CSR and <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange.</b> The study identifies new ways of understanding the scope of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange,</b> and sheds new light on the relationship between <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> and impact. The thesis offers new understanding about how universities and PSREs apply stakeholder management, and offers insights into how universities and PSREs decide how to engage with external organisations. The thesis sheds light on how CSR is practised in universities and PSREs, and demonstrates how CSR is an implicit part of the mindset of universities and PSREs. The research findings show how <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> is influencing academic values and how a modified set of these can provide a starting point for defining <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> ethics and values. The study shows how managing ethical issues in <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> is a task that still needs to be addressed. The concept of Responsible <b>Knowledge</b> <b>Exchange</b> can provide a starting point for this by encouraging debate about the responsibilities of <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> practitioners, and their ethics and values. Raising awareness about the kind of ethical dilemmas which <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> practitioners can face may prompt universities and PSREs and <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange</b> professional networks, such as AURIL and PraxisUnico, to develop ways and ideas for handling and managing ethical issues in <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange.</b> These kinds of approaches could help to foster more awareness of values and ethical boundaries in <b>knowledge</b> <b>exchange,</b> and greater awareness of the issues that can arise...|$|R
