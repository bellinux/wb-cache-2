40|$|Face-to-face {{interviews}} were conducted to identify the main changes in gear and vessel technology that may have improved the fishing efficiency {{of a number of}} French, Danish, and Basque fleets over the past few decades. Important changes include the gradual appearance of twin trawls (Danish and French trawlers) and trammel-nets (French gillnetters), and the increased polyvalence of Basque bottom trawlers. The results suggest that fishing effort descriptors that are not traditionally measured (<b>gear</b> <b>type,</b> groundrope <b>type,</b> length of net used per day, headline length, crew size, number of winch or net drums) may have a substantial impact on catch rates. Adjusting fishing effort using such descriptors may generally improve the relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality...|$|R
40|$|The {{key element}} of robot is its gripper system, which can {{accommodate}} a variety of work pieces. Two finger grippers sometimes of lever <b>type,</b> cam <b>type,</b> <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> or mixed <b>type</b> are very common for many industrial applications. The present paper aims at the design and development of a four-fingered dextrous gripper with suitable electrical actuator system for transferring and transmitting flexural motions of the articulated fingers with suitable mechanical structures and tendons. Various hardware elements have been designed, constructed and evaluated for the dextrous hand. Each finger is having distal, proximal and metacarpophalangeal joints having three degrees of freedom so as to open and close with different postures for manipulating the objects with electric tendon actuation system. As a first step towards achieving pretension, optimal flexibility, high performance and well-behaved characteristics of the gripper, a multiple degree-of-freedom dextrous hand has been designed, constructed and evaluated. Various tactile and non-tactile sensors have been designed and mounted on the fingers with necessary control. During the execution of tasks, slip sensors provide information for grasping and manipulating the objects with certainty. The force sensors provide the magnitude of optimum force during grasping without slip. Thus the prototype gripper {{has been found to}} be capable of grasping the objects of different shapes with an optimal force...|$|R

This information can be used to evaluate the importance of specific geographic areas to the overall movement patterns of a species and to explain exploitation patterns and vulnerability to different fishing <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> Different <b>types</b> of tag are briefly reviewed and an example given of combining traditional tag-and-recapture with electronic tag data to focus on a specific fishery that targets an aggregated tuna resource. The possibility is discussed of applying similar techniques to address questions surrounding the Charleston Bump.

The current mortality and serious injury of humpback whales in the Gulf of Maine is twice the Potential Biological Removal (PBR) level set for this population.

Catch composition, species richness, diversity, mean length, trophic level, percentage of mature and optimum sized fish and percentage of megaspawners were determined for the fish catches of each <b>gear</b> <b>type.</b> Four <b>types</b> of static <b>gears</b> (gill nets, trammel nets, bottom longline and semi-pelagic longline) with different mesh sizes or hook sizes represented the small-scale fisheries and were studied using data from experimental fishing trials, while commercial catches of two trawling <b>types,</b> crustacean trawling and fish trawling exemplified the industrial fisheries. Different species dominated the catches of the different main gears. Gill nets were clearly differentiated by the low trophic levels. Semi-pelagic longline caught larger fish with high trophic levels. Trammel nets also had high percentage of mature individuals in the catches, but also more non-target species. The trawlers affected juveniles of many species. Larger mesh sizes caught larger individuals, though not necessarily mature. The ordination procedure revealed how gear catches are best characterized by the different indicators and catch composition. Technical interactions were apparent when some gears affected juveniles of target species of other gears. Management recommendations such as minimum legal size, closed areas, gear restrictions and modifications are provided. Fishers participation in management can be enhanced by explanations of these simple indicators. Public participation can be extremely important for supporting unpopular management measures...|$|R
40|$|The Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DWHOS) necessitated a whole-water-column {{approach}} for assessment {{that included the}} epipelagic (0 – 200 m), mesopelagic (200 – 1000 m), and bathypelagic (3 ̆e 1000 m) biomes. The latter two biomes collectively form the largest integrated habitat in the Gulf of Mexico (GOM). As part of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) process, the Offshore Nekton Sampling and Analysis Program (ONSAP) was implemented to evaluate impacts from the spill and to enhance basic knowledge regarding the biodiversity, abundance, and distribution of deep-pelagic GOM fauna. Over 12, 000 cephalopods were collected during this effort, using two different trawl methods (large midwater trawl [LMT] and 10 -m 2 Multiple Opening and Closing Net Environmental Sensing System [MOC 10]). Prior to this work, 93 species of cephalopods were known from the GOM. Eighty cephalopod species were sampled by ONSAP, and additional analyses will certainly increase this number as hard-to-identify taxa are resolved. Of these species, seven were previously unknown in the GOM, including two probable undescribed species. Because additional work is continuing using only the MOC 10, cephalopod species composition of the LMT and MOC 10 trawls are compared here for possible differences in inferred diversity and relative abundance.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The Arctic {{ecosystem}} {{is changing}} rapidly, yet information on nearshore fish assemblages for the northeastern Chukchi Sea is extremely limited. To address this information gap, we sampled nearshore fish assemblages with a beach seine {{and a small}} bottom trawl at six stations in the northeastern Chukchi Sea in August 2007, 2008, and 2009, and in September 2009. Catch and species composition differed by <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> and between sample periods, including the two in 2009. A total of 16 039 fish representing 18 species were captured in 24 beach seine hauls, and 3108 fish representing 24 species were captured in 48 trawl tows. Beach seine catch was dominated by capelin (83 %), and trawl catch was dominated by Arctic cod (56 %). Species that were good discriminators between <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> were capelin (seine) and slender eelblenny (trawl), and uniden-tified small sculpins were the most common taxa caught with both <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> Capelin and Arctic cod captured by either <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> were mostly juveniles (judging by size). Variability among sampling periods in catch and species composition within <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> can likely be attributed to annual variations in environmental conditions, including differences in water temperature (range: 2 ˚ – 9 ˚C). The shallow nearshore environment of the northeastern Chukchi Sea provides important habitat for many fish species and is extremely vulnerable to disturbance. Loss of sea ice from global warming may open up formerly inaccessible areas to oil and gas exploration, vessel traffic, and commercial fishing. Thus, long-term monitoring of nearshore fish assemblages in the Alaskan Arctic is necessary for managers {{to make informed decisions}} in this fragile environment.

We evaluated the effectiveness of six different <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> (seine nets, boat electrofishers, hoop nets, Windermere traps, trap nets, and minnow traps) in sampling the fish assemblage at 30 sites in the shallow offshore waters of the middle Detroit River in July and August 2003. A total of 2, 449 fish representing 38 species in 15 families were captured by seining (1, 293 fish, 29 species), boat electrofishing (398 fish, 23 species), hoop nets (524 fish, 26 species), and Windermere traps (234 fish, 14 species). Trap nets and minnow traps were not effective in sampling offshore littoral sites. Significantly higher fish species richness and abundance were obtained and more unique species were captured by seine nets than by any other <b>gear</b> <b>type.</b> When effort is constant, the highest richness and abundance are obtained by seine nets. Windermere traps produced significantly lower abundance and richness than all other <b>gear</b> <b>types,</b> but proportionally more benthic species. Total species accumulation rates were not markedly reduced when Windermere trap data were excluded. Use of additional Windermere traps at each site could increase abundance, but samples taken by Windermere traps had the lowest rarefied richness among <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> at any level of abundance.
