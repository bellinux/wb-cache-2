Based on the experiences of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, this article establishes six broad policy principles for effective external engagement.

Third, for a transitional state to succeed it needs sufficient external motivation to sustain it through political and economic fluctuations. Fourth, if foreign aid does not come hand in hand with adequate accountability standards, it brings corruption and stagnation. Fifth, building local (and not foreign) capacity is the primary duty of an <b>external</b> <b>actor.</b> Finally, the reputation of an <b>external</b> <b>actor</b> {{is as important as the}} work that this actor conducts.

40|$|When {{the former}} {{leaders of the}} anti-apartheid {{movement}} became the new political leadership of the country, many believed that ‘the adversarial social struggle’ with the state had ended. However, {{within a few years}} of democracy, new social struggles emerged between the state and civil society. An example of the new struggles that emerged came due to increasing discontent regarding the government’s lack of effective HIV/AIDS action. The Lusikisiki programme {{is one of the first}} rural treatment programmes for HIV/AIDS implemented in South Africa. Despite national conflicts between the state and civil society over treatment policies, this is a case where the principal actors on each side, the Department of Health and the Treatment Action Campaign, seem to have put aside previous conflicts and engaged in local treatment collaboration in partnership with an <b>external</b> <b>actor</b> and NGO, Médecins Sans Frontières. The Lusikisiki programme has recently undergone a transition from being an NGO driven pilot project to a public sector programme. The withdrawal of the <b>external</b> <b>actor</b> created a number of challenges for the programme. For instance, Lusikisiki experienced a loss of both technical and financial support and bottlenecks for sustaining the original model have appeared at the policy level. Spaces and opportunities that were opened up by the <b>external</b> <b>actor</b> have to a certain extent been closed again. These experiences point to the fact that local governance is inherently political and inscribed in political structures and processes that far exceeds a particular locality. The thesis studies the political dynamics of local governance of HIV/AIDS in the case of Lusikisiki. It is based upon a qualitative case study of a rural HIV/AIDS programme and employs a theoretical framework concerned with the politics of governance...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} an <b>external</b> <b>actor’s</b> democracy promotion policies on domestic democratic development. More specifically, it is {{a case study of}} the European Union as an <b>external</b> <b>actor,</b> using Belarus as the domestic polity of focus. My research questions are: (1) What have been the policies of the EU intended to encourage democracy in Belarus? and (2) What have been the impacts of these policies on Belarus’ level of democracy in comparison to the rest of Central and Eastern Europe? To respond to these questions, a definition and method of measuring democracy is proposed, and Belarus’ level of democracy as it relates to that of neighboring countries is evaluated. I theorize that external agents have a significant role in this process, largely through diffusion. The most important forms of diffusion highlighted in this thesis are linkage, leverage, neighbor, and that occurring via transnational advocacy networks. Conditionality, or the notion of an <b>external</b> <b>actor</b> offering a domestic polity a set of incentives and/or disincentives for modifying its standards, behaviors, practices, etc. is the method by which the EU most frequently attempts to affect democratization. For this reason, EU democracy promotion policies based on conditionality are the focus of this paper. I proceed by analyzing three specific, conditionality-based policy instruments the EU has utilized over the past decade to encourage democratization in Belarus. Each instrument’s purported objectives, incentives and conditionality requirements are considered before its impacts are assessed according to the corresponding political developments in Belarus at that time. This serves as a relevant indicator {{of whether or not the}} policy was successful in meeting its objectives, and may provide further insights into the types of policies which appear to be successful in effecting democratic progress. The results found that the policies the EU has implemented thus far have had varying degrees of success: the Eastern Neighborhood Policy, very strict in its conditionality requirements, had very little impact; the Eastern Partnership, a more multilateral, collaborative approach with more lenient requirements for participation produced slightly better results until 2010 when there was a violent political crackdown in Belarus; lastly, the Dialogue on Modernization, which places a greater emphasis on civil society, has made greater strides in supporting and legitimizing opposition groups in Belarus – motivating certain members of the Belarusian political elite to express their desire to participate, a positive sign. My findings also suggest that initial signs of progress do not necessarily signal substantive, long-lasting change will occur. Further research into the EU’s ability to influence democratic change in Belarus is necessary...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In voting theory, bribery {{is a form}} of {{manipulative}} {{behavior in}} which an <b>external</b> <b>actor</b> (the briber) offers to pay the voters to change their votes in order to get her preferred candidate elected. We investigate a model of bribery where the price of each vote depends on the amount of change that the voter is asked to implement. Specifically, in our model the briber can change a voter’s preference list by paying for a sequence of swaps of consecutive candidates. Each swap may have a different price; the price of a bribery is the sum of the prices of all swaps that it involves. We prove complexity results for this model, which we call swap bribery, for a broad class of voting rules, including variants of approval and k-approval, Borda, Copeland, and maximin. ...|$|R
