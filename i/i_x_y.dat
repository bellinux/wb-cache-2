Instead of the squared amplitude of the gradient that is traditionally used to drive the non-linear diffusion, we use the Teager energy, which {{is known to be}} less sensitive to noise.

40|$|Bilinear {{interpolation}} {{is often}} used to improve image quality after performing spatial transformation operations such as digital zooming or rotation. In the traditional case where the input coordinates appear in a raster-based fashion, the required pixel values can be obtained from the previous calculation, the frame buffer and a single line cache. This paper presents a novel approach to performing real-time bilinear interpolation that is useful in applications such as lens distortion correction where the input coordinates follow a curved path that spans multiple rows. To help retrieve the required pixels in a single clock cycle under imposed data bandwidth constraints a unique caching system has been devised. In the event that constraints make it impossible to obtain the four required pixel values, the approach performs a modified three-point interpolation. An example field programmable gate array implementation of the bilinear interpolation method used in conjunction with a lens distortion correction algorithm has been successfully completed.

Unfortu-nately, this method suffers from a notoriously difficult problem with aliasing. This survey will consider why the problem is hard, several classes of solutions, and some of the issues that require further study. Before discussing ray tracing in particular, some general concepts of images and signals will be reviewed. An image is an example of a two-dimensional signal, and can be in one of several different representations. For example, in a television camera, a lens system focuses an optical image onto a target. That image is a two-dimensional region of varying light intensity and color. When the target is scanned, an electrical signal is produced which is "analogous " to the optical image. In this paper, both the optical and the electrical rep-resentations will be called analog images, because they both consist of continuously variable physical quantities. A second possible representation is that of a symbolic image. For example, a "zone plate " pattern can be expresses as a two-dimensional function, <b>I</b> (<b>x,</b> <b>y)</b> = sin(x 2 + y 2). Symbolic images may be continuously variable, but they consist of mathematical expressions or computer programs rather than tangible physical quantities.

Configurations describe how an object X in A decomposes into subobjects. The first paper defined configurations and studied moduli spaces of (I, ≼) -configurations in A, using the theory of Artin stacks.
