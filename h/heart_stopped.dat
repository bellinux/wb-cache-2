500|$|After Jenna's birth, Schmirler {{experienced}} {{many health}} problems.

Tests showed that a cancerous node the size of a fist had developed behind her heart. As her condition worsened, she underwent surgery on September 6, 1999. During surgery, a dead piece of the tumour broke off and released a blood clot into her lung. Her <b>heart</b> <b>stopped</b> beating, and only emergency heart massage kept her alive. Almost a month after being diagnosed with cancer, doctors finally provided a specific diagnosis – metastatic adenocarcinoma, with an unknown primary site. Because no one could pin down where the cancer came from, Sandra referred to it as [...] "the cancer from Mars." [...] In addition to chemotherapy and radiation, Schmirler explored orthomolecular medicine through the Canadian Cancer Research Group. This form of alternative medicine involves large doses of vitamins and nutrients.|$|E

2500|$|CABG is {{performed}} to relieve angina unsatisfactorily controlled by maximum tolerated anti-ischemic medication, prevent or relieve left ventricular dysfunction, and/or {{reduce the risk}} of death. CABG does not prevent myocardial infarction (heart attack). This surgery is usually performed with the <b>heart</b> <b>stopped,</b> necessitating the usage of cardiopulmonary bypass. [...] However, two alternative techniques are also available, allowing CABG to be performed on a beating heart either without using the cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure referred to as [...] "off-pump" [...] surgery, or performing beating surgery using partial assistance of the cardiopulmonary bypass, a procedure referred to as [...] "on-pump beating" [...] surgery. The latter procedure offers the advantages of the on-pump stopped and off-pump while minimizing their respective side-effects.|$|E

2500|$|Faithfull began {{living in}} New York {{after the release}} of the {{follow-up}} to Broken English, Dangerous Acquaintances, in 1981. Despite her comeback, she was still battling with addiction in the mid-1980s, at one point breaking her jaw tripping on a flight of stairs while under the influence. In another incident her <b>heart</b> <b>stopped.</b> A disastrous appearance on Saturday Night Live was blamed on too many rehearsals, but it was suspected that drugs had caused her vocal cords to seize up. Rich Kid Blues (1984) was another collection of her early work combined with new recordings, a double record showcasing both the pop and rock 'n' roll facets of her output to date. In 1985, Faithfull performed [...] "Ballad of the Soldier's Wife" [...] on Hal Willner's tribute album [...] Faithfull's restrained readings lent themselves to the material, and this collaboration informed several subsequent works.|$|E
