60|$|The man's deportment was magnificent. But for {{the fact}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> long ago lost all faith in him <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> felt, without the shadow of a doubt, that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a supreme fool of myself. But as it was, my faith was only shaken. The hideous {{possibility}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a mistake was there like a shadow, but I could not accept it as a certainty.|$|R

My servant never ceases drawing near to Me through supererogatory works until I love him. Then, when I love him, I am his hearing through which he hears, his sight through which he sees, his hand through which he grasps, and his foot through which he walks.|$|E
25|$|It's true to {{say these}} {{programmes}} {{about climate change}} are different, in that previously <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> programmes about natural history, and now you could say I have an engaged stance. The first is {{about the fact that}} there is climate change and that it is human-induced. So I'm glad that the BBC wanted some clear statement of the evidence as to why these two things are the case.|$|E
25|$|In this fourth Edition <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> no {{alterations}} of any kind. I now, however, {{find myself}} {{at liberty to}} acknowledge my very great obligations to Mr. HENRY HOP of Amsterdam. To that Gentleman I owe the most distinct, as well as liberal information, concerning a very interesting and important subject, the Bank of Amsterdam; of which no printed account had ever appeared to me satisfactory, or even intelligible. The name of that Gentleman is so well known in Europe, the information which comes from him must do so much honour to whoever has been favoured with it, and my vanity is so much interested in making this acknowledgment, that I can no longer refuse myself the pleasure of prefixing this Advertisement to this new Edition of my Book.|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about her}} sexual orientation, Lohan {{said that she}} was not a lesbian. When asked if she was {{bisexual}} in 2008, she responded [...] "Maybe. Yeah," [...] adding, [...] "I don't want to classify myself." [...] However, in a 2013 interview, she said, [...] "I know I’m straight. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> out with girls before, and I had a relationship with a girl. ...

500|$|... "People in the {{industry}} treated me like I didn't deserve to be spoken to and I was some unwanted object. I couldn't speak English fluently and people made fun of me for that. So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, I guess. I find it hard to deal with praise. Today, when people say that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... It scares me." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{perceived}} that that teaching {{which is our}} salvation was to be had in a much purer and more lively form if sought at the fountain-head and drawn from the actual sources than from pools and runnels. And so I have revised the whole New Testament (as they call it) against the standard of the Greek original... I have added annotations of my own, in order {{in the first place}} to show the reader what changes <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made,</b> and why; second, to disentangle and explain anything that may be complicated, ambiguous, or obscure.|$|E
60|$|Judge Douglas, {{in reply}} to what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> said about having upon a {{previous}} occasion made the speech at Ottawa {{as the one}} he took an extract from at Charleston, says it only shows that I practiced the deception twice. Now, my friends, are any of you obtuse enough to swallow that? Judge Douglas <b>had</b> said <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a speech at Charleston that I would not make up north, and I turned around and answered him by showing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> that same speech up north,--had made it at Ottawa; made it in his hearing; made it in the Abolition District,--in Lovejoy's District,--in the personal presence of Lovejoy himself,--in the same atmosphere exactly in which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> my Chicago speech, of which he complains so much.|$|R

6000|$|She flushed, and <b>I</b> felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> said {{a stupid}} thing, for <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> remarks too similar on another occasion. I added, 'But <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been away.' ...|$|R

500|$|On June 21, 2005, {{the day of}} {{the release}} of his album TheFutureEmbrace, Corgan took out full-page {{advertisements}} in the Chicago Tribune and Chicago Sun-Times to announce that he planned to reunite the band.

But now I want you to be among the first to know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.|$|E
500|$|On July 22, 2013, MLB {{suspended}} Braun for {{the remaining}} 65 games of the regular season, plus the entire postseason, for his involvement with the Biogenesis clinic. Braun, who lost $3.25 million as a result, did not appeal the suspension. In a statement, he said, [...] "I realize now that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> some mistakes. I am {{willing to accept the}} consequences of those actions." [...] ESPN reported that Braun decided to [...] "strike a deal" [...] with MLB after being presented with the evidence against him. Called a [...] "liar", he was heavily criticized by the media and other players, particularly for tarnishing Laurenzi's reputation. In particular, it was later exposed that Braun engaged in a campaign for support from players around the league, accusing Laurenzi Jr. of being an anti-Semite.|$|E

He answered, should I come before I had done? Hast thou done? quoth Varney. Yeah, quoth the man, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it sure. … Many times before it was bruited by the Lord Robert his men that she was dead. … This Verney and divers his {{servants}} used before her death, to wish her death, which made the people to suspect the worse.|$|E
500|$|Standard countered {{and held}} back its {{shipments}} and, {{with the help}} of other railroads, started a price war that dramatically reduced freight payments and caused labor unrest. Rockefeller prevailed and the railroad sold its oil interests to Standard. But in the aftermath of that battle, in 1879 the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania indicted Rockefeller on charges of monopolizing the oil trade, starting an avalanche of similar court proceedings in other states and making a national issue of Standard Oil's business practices. Rockefeller was under great strain during the 1870s and 1880s when he was carrying out his plan of consolidation and integration and being attacked by the press. He complained that he could not stay asleep most nights. Rockefeller later commented:"All the fortune that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> has not served to compensate me for the anxiety of that period." ...|$|E

In 1979, Wigner {{married his}} third wife, Eileen Clare-Patton (Pat) Hamilton, {{the widow of}} {{physicist}} Donald Ross Hamilton, the Dean of the Graduate School at Princeton University, {{who had died in}} 1972. In 1992, at the age of 90, he published his memoirs, The Recollections of Eugene P. Wigner with Andrew Szanton. In it, Wigner said: [...] "The full meaning of life, the collective meaning of all human desires, is fundamentally a mystery beyond our grasp. As a young man, I chafed at this state of affairs. But by now <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> peace with it. I even feel a certain honor to be associated with such a mystery." [...] In his collection of essays Symmetries and Reflections – Scientific Essays (1995), he commented: [...] "It was not possible to formulate the laws of quantum mechanics in a fully consistent way without reference to consciousness." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1952, O'Hara starred {{opposite}} John Wayne {{again in}} Ford's romantic comedy-drama film, The Quiet Man. Shot {{on location in}} Cong, County Mayo, Ireland, O'Hara cited the film to be her [...] "personal favourite of all the pictures <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made.</b> It is the one I am most proud of, and I {{tend to be very}} protective of it. I loved Mary Kate Danaher. I loved the hell and fire in her." [...] Malone notes that she rarely appeared in an interview without mentioning this fact. O'Hara was disconcerted with Ford's harsh treatment of Wayne during the production and constant ribbing. Though Ford generally treated her very well, on one occasion when filming a cart scene in which the wind in her eyes made it difficult to see, Ford yelled [...] "Open your damn eyes" [...] and O'Hara flipped, responding with [...] "What would a bald-headed son of a bitch like you know about hair lashing across his eyeballs".|$|E
500|$|I {{will not}} go on to other matters without {{pointing}} out to you that I chose the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the Doric to those of men, {{which is what the}} ancients have told me: for, when they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that , shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> use, at the palace of Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with distinctive features.|$|E
500|$|Azaria's friends {{refer to}} him as [...] "the freakish mimic" [...] due to his ability to copy almost anyone's voice, {{instantly}} after he has heard it. As a child he believed that everyone could do this, but later {{realized that it was}} not a common talent. Azaria can [...] "remember every voice I hear, famous or otherwise... they kind of remain in the memory banks, so I'm ready to trot them out." [...] Azaria was glad to have found the [...] "ultimate outlet" [...] for this skill, in The Simpsons. He [...] "didn't realize it , but it became like a lab for a character actor. I had to do so many voices." [...] In the early 2000s, Azaria felt he had reached the maximum number of voices he was capable of: [...] "For the first 10 years of The Simpsons, I would develop a bunch of voices. And then... I hit a point when I was tapped out. Every noise I can make, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>made.</b> Even characters like Gargamel, I've done. Even if it was only two or three lines, at some point I've done something similar on The Simpsons, at least somewhere along the line." ...|$|E
