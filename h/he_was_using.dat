5|$|Manne {{frequently}} {{collaborated with}} Mancini in television as well, {{such as in}} the series Peter Gunn (19581961) and Mr. Lucky (19591960). Although Mancini developed such a close partnership with Manne that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> him for practically all his scores and other music at this time, the drummer still found time to perform on movie soundtracks and in TV shows with music by others, including the series Richard Diamond (music by Pete Rugolo, 19591960), and Checkmate (music by John Williams, 19591962), and the film version of Leonard Bernstein's West Side Story (1961).|$|E
5|$|Tracy {{decides that}} he is going to take a break from rehearsals after he is called back on stage to read his cue cards. When Tracy appears to be {{ignoring}} his cue cards, Jenna informs Liz of the situation, and realizes that Tracy might be illiterate, citing an earlier promo cue card mishap ("The Aftermath") as an example. Liz confronts Tracy about the problem; he admits {{that he is}} illiterate and agrees to get help. Liz later notices Tracy reading a newspaper, and learns that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> the ploy to get out of work. Liz tells Tracy that she is not going to take it anymore, and forces him to go through with the sketch.|$|E
50|$|Reza Heydari is a Professional Goalkeeper who is {{currently}} playing for Naft Masjed Soleyman in Persian Gulf Pro League. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> as the second goalkeeper but recently <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> for the starting goalie. He got a good reputation after a win over Foolad.|$|R
50|$|He {{played for}} the Greenville Braves in 1993, 7-6 with a 3.88 in 25 starts. Although <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> entirely as a starter in 1993, in 1994 <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> entirely as a reliever. For the Richmond Braves, he made 52 appearances, going 6-3 with a 3.68 ERA.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he took a second toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|Nicholas Gleaves as Dr. James Whitaker. Whitaker {{serves as}} the main {{antagonist}} of the second series. He is a biochemist leading the research into a cure for the virus {{from the safety of}} a biologically secure research and development facility. As the research begins to require increasingly unethical practices, he lies and rationalises in the struggle to maintain the loyalty of his colleagues. Unbeknownst to the other workers (all of whom had lost loved ones in the pandemic), he had secreted his wife (portrayed by Alisa Arnah) and young son within the facility, violating protocol. His true motives are suspect, as he answers to someone called Mr. Landry, with whom he communicates over a satellite video link. Until his death <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> stolen anti-virus produced from Abby's blood for himself, keeping it from the others, who died when the virus got into the lab after Abby infected his wife. At {{the end of the second}} series, he is accidentally shot and killed by a sniper in Landry's employ.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, American Pharoah {{started as}} the 2.9–1 {{favorite}} in an eighteen-runner {{field for the}} 141st running of the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. His opponents included Dortmund, winner of the Santa Anita Derby; Carpe Diem, who won the Breeders' Futurity Stakes and Blue Grass Stakes; Firing Line, winner of the Sunland Derby; Wood Memorial winner Frosted; Florida Derby winner Materiality; international entry Mubtaahij, who earned his way to Kentucky with a win in the UAE Derby; and Upstart, winner of the Holy Bull Stakes. The crowd surrounding the horse during the walk-over from the barns to the paddock upset American Pharoah, and several grooms were required to keep him under control. He continued to misbehave until he was loaded into the starting gate; his connections and supporters worried that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> up energy he needed for the race.|$|E
5000|$|<b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> {{mostly on}} special teams during his first two seasons. In 1963, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} <b>used</b> as a split end and started 6 games, before being moved to tight end because he excelled in blocking.|$|R
60|$|He {{slipped his}} soggy boots {{off his feet}} and, having laid {{a piece of wood}} on top of the stove, put his heels on it comfortably. His chair squeaked as he leaned back on its hind legs, but he paid no attention; <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to it, exactly as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> to his wife's {{lameness}} and ceaseless toil.|$|R

5|$|Rossi, {{who started}} from pole position, was {{overtaken}} by Maricello {{at the start}} of the first lap. He had a small lead which was reduced because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> super soft tyres which had higher degradation levels, allowing Rossi and Vandoorne to draw closer. Rossi gained the lead after Maricello made a pit stop for new tyres. Vandoorne became the new leader after getting ahead of Rossi when both drivers made pit stops, and maintained it to win the event. In the second race, Marciello started from the pole position but lost the lead to Stanaway after making a slow getaway from his starting position. The event was processional with few overtaking manoeuvres occurring and Stanaway remained the leader for the rest of the race to clinch the victory.|$|E
5|$|This led to {{a series}} of {{increasingly}} sophisticated models to better predict the effectiveness of an ABM system and what the opposition would do to improve their performance against it. A key development was the Prim-Read theory, which provided an entirely mathematical solution to generating the ideal defensive layout. Using a Prim-Read layout for Nike-X, Air Force Brigadier General Glenn Kent began considering Soviet responses. His 1964 report produced a cost-exchange ratio that required $2 of defense for every $1 of offence if one wanted to limit US casualties to 30 percent of the population. The cost increased to 6-to-1 if the US wished to limit casualties to 10 percent. ABMs would only be cheaper than ICBMs if the US was willing to allow over half its population die in the exchange. When he realized <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> outdated exchange rates for the Soviet ruble, the exchange ratio for the 30 percent casualty rate jumped to 20-to-1.|$|E
5|$|Vettel {{achieved}} {{his sixth}} pole {{position of the}} season, and his first at the Circuit Gilles Villeneuve, {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 13.014 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Alonso, with teammate Massa in third, giving Ferrari their best qualifying performance of the season. Webber {{had not been able to}} use his car's KERS and qualified fourth, four-tenths of a second behind Vettel. Hamilton and Button qualified in fifth and seventh respectively and McLaren blamed the slow pace on too high levels of downforce on the high-speed circuit. The Mercedes drivers qualified in sixth and eighth, and Heidfeld and Vitaly Petrov completed the top ten. Paul di Resta was in 11th position, ahead of fellow rookies Pastor Maldonado and Kobayashi. Adrian Sutil struggled with grip throughout the session and was 14th; following him were Sébastien Buemi, Barrichello and de la Rosa. Jaime Alguersuari qualifying in 18th complained of insufficient grip and brake balance, and at the back of the grid were the Lotus, HRT and Virgin drivers. D'Ambrosio did not qualify after failing to set a time within 107% in the first qualifying session. However the stewards allowed him to race, having considered <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> a new chassis after an accident in Friday practice, where he had set faster lap times.|$|E

5|$|Through his {{involvement}} with the Design and Industries Association Holden met Frank Pick, {{general manager of the}} Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Holden at the time had no experience in designing for transport, but this would change through his collaboration with Pick. In 1923, Pick commissioned Holden to design a façade for a side entrance at Westminster tube station. This was followed in 1924 with an appointment to design the UERL's pavilion for the British Empire Exhibition. Also in 1924, Pick commissioned Holden to design seven new stations in south London for the extension of the City and South London Railway (now part of the Northern line) from Clapham Common to Morden. The designs replaced a set by the UERL's own architect, Stanley Heaps, which Pick had found unsatisfactory. The designs reflect the simple modernist style <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>using</b> in France for the war cemeteries; double-height ticket halls are clad in plain Portland stone framing a glazed screen, each adapted to suit the street corner sites of most of the stations. The screens feature the Underground roundel made up in coloured glass panels and are divided by stone columns surmounted by capitals formed as a three-dimensional version of the roundel. Holden also advised Heaps on new façades for a number of the existing stations on the line and produced the design for a new entrance at Bond Street station on the Central London Railway.|$|E

50|$|In {{his senior}} year at Purdue, Buente pitched in 13 games all starts. Unlike seasons past when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> as a reliever, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>used</b> as a starter for the entire season. He went 6-4 with 70 strikeouts and a 3.40 ERA. He would set career highs in almost every {{category}} including strikeouts, earned run average, wins, games started, complete games and hits per nine innings.|$|R
50|$|In , Pinto {{stepped back}} into his {{situational}} lefty role, but <b>he</b> has <b>been</b> <b>used</b> many times as a multi-inning reliever and was even considered for a rotation spot during spring training.
