40|$|The present {{analysis}} {{develops a}} methodology {{to identify and}} to choose the functional unit taking into account both {{quantity and quality of}} wheat for bread making. Relations between variety, yield, quality and nitrogen fertilisation are used to study the influence of the choice of functional unit in determining the fertilisation optimum. This study demonstrates that environmental optimisation of a multifunctional production can be realised by analogy with allocation procedures according to system extension. The environmental optimum is determined for each effect class by looking at the <b>fertiliser</b> <b>level</b> which minimises the impact score per functional unit. The optimal level of fertilisation is strongly influenced by the wheat quality. For nitrogen, environmental optimum in different effect classes ranges from 100 kg N/ha for a per unit area assessment, up to 220 kg N/ha for a per kg wheat assessment, especially if a correction for protein content according to the variety is considered. 1...|$|E

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of different <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> was evaluated {{in terms of}} plant growth, plant shape, and leaf quality. Experiments were conducted on two cultivars of Aechmea of known sensitivity (high and low, respectively) to physiological leaf damage. Plants were grown under two <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> (a fertigation solution of 1. 2 mS cm- 1, or a fertigation solution of 2. 4 mS cm- 1) over a 9 -month treatment period. In general, the lower <b>level</b> of <b>fertiliser</b> resulted in more desirable, compact plants, with leaf length as the major parameter determining plant shape. The higher <b>level</b> of <b>fertiliser</b> improved the growth rate significantly, but also increased the risk of leaf quality problems. The extent of this effect was strongly cultivar-dependent. In practice, growers will have to compromise between plant shape and leaf quality on the one hand, and growth rate on the other.

40|$|Sugarcane has a {{variable}} propensity to produce suckers, late-formed tillers in mature crops. These suckers {{are low in}} sugar content and result in a dilution of the sucrose content of the harvested crop. Differences in the propensity to form suckers have been observed among cultivars within the same experiment and within different parts of a crop of the same cultivar. The environmental factors promoting sucker initiation, or suckering have, however, not been elucidated. A field experiment was run in plant and first ratoon crops to investigate the factors of post-monsoonal irrigation, nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>level,</b> and within-row stool spacing to test the roles of soil moisture, soil nitrogen and light in suckering. Although {{the effects of these}} treatments on mature stalk traits were significant but small, their effects on suckering were relatively large. Increased soil nitrogen and soil moisture promoted suckering and these effects were additive. Plant density, although generating measurable differences in the light levels penetrating the canopy, did not result in a consistent effect on suckering. The effect of suckers in reducing commercial cane sugar (CCS) content was greater than previously reported. CCS was reduced by 1. 6 and 1. 3 units in the plant and ratoon crops, respectively, for each 10 % of the harvested crop mass that were suckers.

40|$|Dairy {{production}} systems in Europe are {{to a large}} extent based on ley-arable rotations. In the ley phase of such rotations nitrogen accumulation occurs as a result of (1) organic carbon accumulation in soil not disturbed by tillage operations and (2) a considerable nitrogen surplus in grasslands, particularly under grazing regimes where {{a large part of the}} N in ingested grass is recycled to soil via urine and faeces. The accumulation of N and C in grasslands starts soon after establishment, the rate asymptotically declining with age and depends on practices such as <b>fertiliser</b> <b>level,</b> animal feed composition, stocking density, length of grazing and the botanical composition of the sward. In these pasture systems, key perennial legumes are white clover (Trifolium repens L.) red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and lucerne (Medicago sativa). They are used because of their valuable contribution to production, feed quality and N inputs via biological fixation of atmospheric N 2 (Ledgard et al., 2010) Grassland cultivation almost always results in a substantial residual effect and the mineralization of N often exceeds the requirement of the succeeding crop. Thus, there is a high risk of nitrate leaching following sward cultivation. Management practices to control nitrate losses include delayed ploughing until late winter or spring, the use of efficient catch crops after ploughing and a reduction in fertilizer N application to cereals after ploughing. The objective of this paper is to illustrate by examples the importance of management for N fertility building and efficient utilization in crop rotations containing forage legumes. ...|$|E

In many settings colonisation promotes host growth, increases yield and protects the host from fungal diseases. We evaluated the effect of P. indica on Fusarium head blight (FHB) disease of winter (cv. Battalion) and spring (cv. Paragon, Mulika, Zircon, Granary, KWS Willow and KWS Kilburn) wheat and consequent contamination by the mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) under UK weather conditions.

Land management techniques such as contour hedgerow systems are very effective in erosion control but they also {{may lead to a}} pronounced spatial variability in crop response. However, our understanding of this phenomenon at field scale is still limited. This study aimed, therefore, at assessing the spatial variability in crop response under contour hedgerow systems. Data were collected from an erosion control experiment in the Loei province of Northeast Thailand established in 2003.

40|$|Flavonoids are polyphenolic {{substances}} {{that are common}} in many {{fruits and vegetables and}} may have positive protective effects against e. g. cardiovascular disease and some forms of cancer. These effects have mainly been attributed to their antioxidative properties. One of the most common flavonoids in food plants is quercetin, of which yellow onion (Allium cepa L.) is one of our main dietary sources. The effects of cultivars, nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>level,</b> lifting time, curing, cultivation system and storage conditions on the quercetin content in yellow onion are investigated in this thesis. Analyses were performed using reversed-phase HPLC after extraction of raw onion samples in ethanol. The main determinant of quercetin level was found to be the amount of global solar radiation during the end of the bulbing phase in August. Annual variations in quercetin content were higher than any treatment effect within each year. Cultivar differences in quercetin levels were significant but inconsistent. Early lifting, when 50 % of the onions had fallen leaves, resulted in onions with better keeping quality and equal quercetin content compared with onions with later lifting times. Minimised split application of nitrogen fertilisers reduced the risk of mineral nutrient leaching without lowering the yield or quercetin content. Field curing generally resulted in significant increases in quercetin content compared with levels at lifting. The role of onion size for quercetin content was inconsistent but of minor importance. Quercetin levels were stable during cold storage at constant temperature. No {{significant differences were found between}} inorganically fertilised and organically fertilised onions of the same cultivar or between directly sown and transplanted onions.

40|$|For {{potato tubers}} destined for French fry production, dry matter and nitrate contents, black spot {{susceptibility}} and after cooking blackening {{as well as}} fry colour after storage are important quality characteristics. The possibilities to manipulate these characteristics and tuber yield with nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>level</b> and an additional spring application of potassium (300 kg K 2 O*ha- 1, as sulphate or chloride) were investigated {{in a number of}} cultivars, on various locations and in several years. The choice of cultivar proved to have much more relevant impact on characteristics than the ranges of nitrogen and potassium fertilisation. It was analysed to what extent variance of quality characteristics was accounted for by the different experimental factors. Depending on characteristic, about 10 to 30 % was accounted for by cultivar. Nitrogen and potassium fertiliser contributed only 0 to 10 %. The major part of variance was caused by environmental influences related to the factors location, year and their interactions with the other experimental factors. For tuber dry matter and nitrate contents and for black spot susceptibility also variance within lots was investigated. The greater part of the variance was found within rather than between experimental plots. In two experiments for tuber dry matter and nitrate contents variance was analysed down to the level of individual plants, individual stems and individual tubers. Differences between tubers originating from the same stems accounted for 80 to 90 % of total variance found within potato lots. Since nitrogen reduces some quality characteristics its effect on yield was also analysed in order to gain insight into the need for increased financial return by a higher price for increased tuber quality to compensate the grower for lower yield at lower nitrogen levels. The required absolute price increase is rather small, however it is questionable whether buyers are willing to pay the rise since quality benefits of lower nitrogen dressings were also quite small. High potassium levels have positive effects on fry colour, after cooking blackening and black spot susceptibility; the latter was especially reduced when applying potassium in the chloride form. Based on presented yield data and on analysis of historical data it is postulated that in present Dutch practice ware potato growers are too reluctant to use potassium chloride on clay soils in spring in fear of yield depression, caused by high salinity levels. Tuber sucrose, dry matter and nitrate contents as well as ground cover by the crop canopy were determined before and at harvest time and linked to fry colour index after storage, for two cultivars at two locations in three years. None of the parameters at any time of determination correlated well enough with fry colour after storage to allow a prediction of the latter before or at the time of harvest. In many - but not all - cases the fry colour index was increased by increased nitrogen dressing. Effects of nitrogen on fry colour and effects on pre-harvest determined parameters also did not correlate well enough to allow a prediction of the effect of nitrogen on fry colour. Analysis of the manageable factors (cultivar, nitrogen, potassium and chloride level) and the unmanageable factors (location and year) showed that of the manageable factors cultivar accounted for most of the variation in quality characteristics between lots. Nitrogen, potassium and chloride fertilisation accounted for only small portions of the variation between lots. The major portion of the variation between lots was accounted for by location and year and their interactions with the controlable factors. Apart from choice of cultivar growers appear to have little control over the variation in tuber quality characteristics between and within lots...|$|E

A set of 45 wheats from nine varieties representing the range of commercial varieties grown in the UK, and grown over three harvest years at several nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels,</b> were milled at five roll gaps under Sharp-to-Sharp and Dull-to-Dull dispositions. The resulting particle size distributions were fitted with a DNKBF {{in order to understand}} the physical significance of the DNKBF parameters and to relate them to shape and hardness. The DNKBF parameters related strongly to hardness as measured using either the Single Kernel Characterisation System or Particle Size Index, allowing the particle size distribution over the range 0 – 4000 μm to be predicted solely from wheat hardness. A residual analysis showed that the remaining variation was correlated with kernel mass, and that more elongated kernels break to give slightly larger particles than more spherical kernels of equivalent hardness. Two types of breakage are identified, one of which principally produces many small endosperm particles along with large bran particles, while the other tends to produce mid-sized particles.

40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{establish}} whether a high onion yield and good storage performance {{could be obtained}} with low fertilisation rates if irrigation was applied when necessary. Two-year experiments investigated the effects of three NPK <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> (N 50, 100, 125 / 150 kg/ha), with and without irrigation, on yield, advancement of maturity, storage losses and shelf life. High fertilisation advanced maturity but irrigation had no effect. High fertilisation increased yield only in 1996 (5 B 7 %), but irrigation increased the yield noticeably: by 33. 5 % in 1995 and 8. 5 % in 1996. There was no interaction between fertilisation and irrigation. The low fertilisation optimum is attributed to the mineralisation of soil nitrogen, as the soil was rich in organic matter. At the low fertilisation level, plants took up twice as much nitrogen as present in the fertiliser, and with increased fertilisation the nitrogen uptake increased markedly. The foliage nitrogen content was low, evidently {{as a result of}} late harvesting. Treatments had only a minor effect on the storage performance and shelf life of onions. The results suggest that fertilisation rates could be reduced in onion production.

The experiment was set in a split-plot design with two factors and three replications. The five irrigation treatments - I 1 : freshwater (groundwater extracted by tubewell) as control, I 2 -I 4 : diluted wastewater (having wastewater fraction of 0. 25, 0. 50 and 0. 75, respectively) and I 5 : raw/undiluted wastewater - were allocated to the main plots, and the two <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> - F 0 : no fertiliser and F 1 : recommended standard dose - were allocated to the sub-plots. The wastewater contained nitrogen (N),phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) at concentrations of 17. 5, 3. 7 and 10. 3 mg L- 1, respectively, which correspondingly contributed 4. 8 - 19. 1, 3. 8 - 15. 1 and 5. 4 - 21. 7 % of the recommended N, P and K. Wastewater exerted a significant (alfa = 0. 05) positive impact on most growth and yield variables and grain and biomass yields of wheat irrespective of the applied fertiliser dose. The highest values of the crop variables and yields were generally obtained in I 4 F 1 (irrigation water containing 75 % wastewater under the fertilised condition) and I 5 F 0 (irrigation by raw wastewater under the nonfertilised condition). On average, over three years, the treatments that received 50 - 100 % wastewater in irrigation (I 3 F 1 - I 5 F 1) provided statistically identical results. Although wastewater always promoted leaf growth, its effectiveness in improving the leaf area index (LAI) decreased with its elevated quantity in irrigation. Raw wastewater promoted the highest leaf growth at 65 days after sowing (DAS) and provided the maximum LAI under both fertility treatments. The significantly different above-ground dry matters (ADM) among the irrigation treatments obtained at the later growth stages (95 - 110 DAS) exposed a delayed effectiveness of wastewater in the accumulation of shoot biomass. The raw wastewater contributed to producing the highest ADM under both fertility treatments. The most extensive root proliferation was in I 4 F 1, which produced the highest grain and biomass yields; the grain yield increased in this treatment by 14 % over I 1 F 1. Both the grain and biomass yields in I 3 F 1 - I 5 F 1 treatments were statistically similar.

There were significant effects of both genotype and genotype-by-fertiliser interaction for grain yield, which were closely associated with total N and P content at maturity. There was, however, also significant genotypic variation in nutrient-use efficiency (grain yield per unit nutrient absorbed), and this {{also contributed to the}} genotypic variation for grain yield. There was a large effect of genotype and a smaller effect of genotype-by-location interaction for nitrogen-use efficiency for grain yield. Nitrogen-use efficiency was negatively correlated with grain N concentration at two of the three locations.

The study determined the nutritional water productivity (NWP) of selected major (groundnut, dry bean) and indigenous (bambara groundnut and cowpea) grain legumes in response to water regimes and environments. Field trials were conducted during 2015 / 16 and 2016 / 17 at three sites in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Ukulinga, Fountainhill and Umbumbulu). Yield and evapotranspiration (ET) data were collected. Grain was analysed for protein, fat, Ca, Fe and Zn nutrient content (NC). Yield, ET and NC were then used to compute NWP. Overall, the major legumes performed better than the indigenous grain legumes. Groundnut had the highest NWPfat. Groundnut and dry bean had the highest NWPprotein. For NWPFe, Zn and Ca, dry bean and cowpea were more productive. Yield instability caused fluctuations in NWP. Water treatments were not significant (p > 0. 05). While there is scope to improve NWP under rainfed conditions, a lack of crop improvement currently limits the potential of indigenous grain legumes. This provides an initial insight on the nutrient content and NWP of a limited number of selected grain legumes in response to the production environment.

Here, by genome-wide association analysis with a panel of 94 elite common wheat varieties, 37 loci were found significantly associated with thousand-grain weight (TGW) {{in one or more}} environments differing in water and <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels.</b> Five loci were stably associated with TGW under all 12 environments examined. Their elite alleles had positive effects on TGW. Four, two, three, and two loci were consistently associated with TGW in the irrigated and fertilised (IF), rainfed (RF), reduced nitrogen (RN), and reduced phosphorus (RP) environments. The elite alleles of the IF-specific loci enhanced TGW under well-resourced conditions, whereas those of the RF-, RN-, or RP-specific loci conferred tolerance to the TGW decrease when irrigation, nitrogen, or phosphorus were reduced. Moreover, the elite alleles of the environment-independent and -specific loci often acted additively to enhance TGW. Four additional loci were found associated with TGW in specific locations, one of which was shown to contribute to the TGW difference between two experimental sites. Further analysis of 14 associated loci revealed that nine affected both grain length and width, whereas the remaining loci influenced either grain length or width, indicating that these loci control grain weight by regulating kernel size. Finally, the elite allele of Xpsp 3152 frequently co-segregated with the larger grain haplotype of TaGW 2 - 6 A, suggesting probable genetic and functional linkages between Xpsp 3152 and GW 2 that are important for grain weight control in cereal plants. Our study provides new knowledge on TGW control in elite common wheat lines, which may aid the improvement of wheat grain weight trait in further research...|$|R
40|$|Understanding how {{plant species}} with similar {{resource}} requirements co-exist {{has been a}} long-standing ecological question with several theoretical explanations. One potential mechanism is the storage effect hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, species co-exist because they differ in when they are most actively using resource and, therefore, respond differently to environmental perturbation. The hypothesis is based on two main assumptions: (i) two competitors have different responses to climate and (ii) the responses to climate are mediated by changes in {{the relative importance of}} intra- and interspecific competition. The hypothesis could provide useful insights into the role of climate in maintaining weed species diversity and potential shifts in dominant species under climate change. This study tested the basic principles of the storage effect hypothesis on weed communities using data from the Broadbalk long-term fertiliser experiment. Relative abundance of weeds in 10 plots with contrasting fertility but no herbicides was assessed for 21 years. Multivariate analyses and generalised additive mixed models were used to analyse the data. The following pairs of species were found to be adapted to similar <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels,</b> but diverged in their response to climate: (i) Papaver rhoeas–Tripleurospermum inodorum, (ii) Medicago lupulina–Vicia sativa and (iii) Scandix pecten-veneris–Ranunculus arvensis. Contrasting responses to spring temperature within these species pairs modified the competition balance providing evidence for the storage effect hypothesis and helping to explain weed co-existence in the Broadbalk experiment.

40|$|Within {{heterogeneous}} land-use {{systems such}} as agroforestry or mixed tree crop plantations, the different morphological and physiological characteristics of the plants, together with their species-specific management, lead to a mosaic of different living conditions for the litter fauna. This may, in turn, influence the processes of decomposition and nutrient cycling and, thus, the growth-conditions of the plants. We studied the effect of different plant species on the litter macrofauna by collecting macro-invertebrates in the Litter layer of an agroforestry system composed of four regionally important tree crop species in central Amazonia: cupuacu (Theobroma grandiflorum), annatto (Biwa orellana), Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) and peach palm (Bactris gasipaes), with the leguminous cover crop Pueraria phaseoloides and spontaneous grasses as soil cover. The agroforestry system was studied at two fertilisation levels and was compared with a peach palm monoculture. We found invertebrates belonging to 18 orders and 44 families. The number of fauna individuals per unit area differed significantly between plant species within the agroforestry system. Both {{the number of individuals}} and the faunal biomass increased linearly with litter dry matter per unit area. The Shannon-Wiener index of family diversity showed a non-linear increase with increasing sampling area and litter mass in the samples, approaching saturation values between 2 and 2. 5. The highest faunal abundance and diversity was found in the litter of the peach palm monoculture, apparently due to the stable and protected habitat provided by the fleshy offshoot remains from the palm harvests. The two <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> only differed with respect to two invertebrate groups, snails and isopods. The results indicate that the creation of a litter and/or mulch layer of at least 3 Mg ha(- 1), but preferably 6 Mg ha(- 1) and the association of tree and cover crop species whose litter has a favourable effect on the fauna with species whose litter has a less favourable effect are suitable management tools for the conservation of an abundant and diverse Litter fauna in plantations and agroforestry systems of the humid tropics...|$|R
40|$|The Chamaecyparis lawsoniana "Ellwood's Gold" is a {{commonly}} grown ornamental golden conifer. A nutritional trial {{was set up}} to investigate the problem of tip burn or necrosis which had been noted on a South Island nursery. Large growth responses to added N, with a range of small conifers grown in outdoor beds, were reported by Benzian. In a trial carried out with a range of soilless media using Chamaecyparis lawsoniana "Ellwoodii", the largest plants were observed at the highest level offertilisation equivalent to 675 g N/m 3 of 5 - 6 month slow-release fertiliser. However, Istas et al reported little affect on growth when comparing several fertilisers at 3 or 4 kg m, 3 on C. lawsoniana "Columnaris". A similar trial was used by Anon to look at the response ofthe latter species to different fertilisers, but growth was relatively poor in response to various mixtures of slow-release fertilisers. Hawkins reported thatrooted cuttings ofthe yellow cypress exposed to very low levels of nutrients were less tolerant of low N than low P or K, although plants survived very low additions if given balanced nutrient levels. Nutrients provided in excess resulted in luxury consumption and eventually resulted in plant death. However, there were clonal response differences. Field work conducted on C. lawsoniana "Alumii" resulted in a recommendation of 1. 7 % to 1. 9 % foliar N content for good plant growth and quality. Winter injury, as evidenced by browning, was more serious in the plants with higher N contents. Container research conducted by Thomas resulted in the conclusion that the xCupressocyparis leylandii (Leyland cypress) requires medium to high N <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> but prefers an acid mix with a pH of about 4. High liming coupled with low N rates was particularly unfavourable for growth. This contrasts with other work when researchers found that this species preferred a pH of 6. 5, while superior results occurred at pH 5. 5 for Juniperus xmedia and Taxus baccata, and pH 4. 5 for Thuja plicata. An experiment was carried out to evaluate the influence of N, P, and lime on the foliage growth of C. lawsoniana 'Ellwood's Gold' so as to provide a fertiliser recommendation for future production...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} impact of biochar on the {{sustainability}} of English agriculture. it takes an integrated approach by looking at a range of agronomic, economic, biodiversity and climate change conditions that affect the total sustainability of biochar. Central to biochar use is its impact on yield. Laboratory and field trials were established to investigate the agronomic properties of biochar in both arable and grassland situations. Biochar strongly increased arable yields when associated with higher nitrogen <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels,</b> showing an increase in Nitrogen Use Efficiency (NUE). Biochar had no apparent impact on grass yield. Central to biochar sustainability is the sustainability of its feedstocks. Four feedstocks were identified whose use could potentially increase local biodiversity, and whose use is potentially sustainable - coppiced hedgerows, undermanaged small farm woodlands, short rotation coppice willow and straw. The impacts of harvesting these on biodiversity were assessed {{through a combination of}} experiments and desk based review. The management of small farm woodlands is likely to increase sustainability. The sustainability of hedgerow coppicing depending on species groups - beetle numbers increased, but small mammal numbers were not affected. There is little evidence about {{the impact of}} removing straw on soil biodiversity, but if biochar replaces straw, straw can be harvested sustainably. The yield results from the arable trials were fed into three spreadsheet models. The first explored the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance of biochar use. To better understand the impact of emission timing on biochar use a novel accounting method - Net Present Carbon- was developed. Biochar use can mitigate or exacerbate climate change, depending on the feedstock used and the boundaries of the model. The second model looked at the net economic balance of biochar use. Depending on feedstocks, biochar can be economical to produce without carbon payments through yield gains. including a C price makes the economic return highly dependent on the C balance. A final model was then developed to investigate the trade-offs of biochar use between five different sustainability objectives: fixed carbon (C), all GHG emissions, economic return, local biodiversity and global biodiversity. Overall sustainability of biochar use depends greatly on what measure is used to assess sustainability - there is no scenario where it is possible to optimise all sustainability indices, instead trade-offs always occur.

40|$|Worldwide the {{resources}} for mineral fertiliser are diminishing. Growth of healthy, high-yielding crop plants requires a stable input {{not only of}} nitrogen and phosphorus, but also of sulfur (S). In natural ecosystems, nutrient cycling is mainly mediated by soil microorganisms, and much research is devoted to optimisation of microbial nutrient cycling for agricultural ecosystems. Several rhizosphere microorganisms are able to mobilise plant-unavailable soil S, and two bacterial genes that {{may be involved in}} the process are atsA, which encodes arylsulfatase, and ssuD which encodes alkanesulfonate monooxygenase. This study investigated the impact of agricultural practices on the overall rhizosphere microbial community and on functional diversity of S-mobilising organisms. Five wheat genotypes with different root-structures were inoculated with different strains of Azospirillum brasilense to determine the influence of wheat genotype and inoculation treatment in a continuous wheat field trial at Narrabri, New South Wales (Australia). Pot trials with vertisol soil from the field-site were carried out to investigate the effect of wheat variety and different inoculation treatments under controlled conditions. For the analysis of the ssuD gene diversity degenerate primers were designed and tested for specificity through cloning and sequencing. Both exploratory NMDS-Analysis and redundancy analysis (RDA) of fingerprinting profiles obtained by T-RFLP (Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) showed that wheat variety has a significant (p< 0. 05) impact on the ssuD gene diversity in the rhizosphere. No significant wheat-genotype related effect could be found for the rhizosphere diversity of the 16 S rRNA gene. A comparison of two crop rotations, (field pea/sorghum/wheat or Indian mustard/sorghum/wheat) also showed clear differences between the 16 S rRNA gene and ssuD gene diversity in the two treatments. In addition, an effect of the interaction between crop rotation (field pea-sorghum-wheat and mustard-sorghum-wheat) and two different N <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> was found on ssuD gene diversity but not on overall bacterial diversity. These findings indicate that cropping measures, including plant genotype, rotation and N-fertiliser level influence not only overall bacterial, but also ssuD gene functional diversity. This study proves that changes in ssuD gene functional and overall bacterial diversity are not congruent, thus pointing out the importance of a detailed analysis of the functional microbial diversity involved in nutrient cycling. Furthermore major environmental drivers correlated with ssuD gene diversity in wheat and canola rhizospheres across NSW and Victoria were assessed with T-RFLP fingerprints. The information about treatment-related changes, and geographical changes in ssuD gene diversity offers the first information that sulfonate-mobilising communities in soil can be influenced. The development of ssuD degenerate primers for pyrosequencing approaches offers a tool to identify key organisms and to measure their behaviour in rhizospheres and impact on plant nutrition. Optimising farm management by taking into account the genetic potential of rhizosphere microorganisms can help to tailor more resource-efficient crop production systems...|$|R
40|$|Long-term {{sustainability}} {{and high}} resource use efficiency are major goals for high quality baking wheat production throughout the world. Present strategies are low input {{systems such as}} organic agriculture or improved conventional systems (integrated). The fertilisation level and strategy, crop protection as well as preceding crop effects may modulate system performance with respect to wheat grain yield, quality and environmental performance of the systems. Our aim was to evaluate data of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) performance from the DOK long-term systems experiment in Switzerland comparing two mixed organic (biodynamic and bioorganic: BIODYN and BIOORG) and a mixed conventional cropping system (CONFYM) using mineral fertilisers and farmyard manure at two fertilisation intensities (level 1 : 50 % of standard fertilisation, level 2 : standard fertilisation) since 1978. A conventional system was fertilised exclusively minerally at level 2 (CONMIN) and a control remained unfertilised (NOFERT). We compared crop yields, baking quality parameters, the nitrogen use efficiency {{and the effect of}} maize and potatoes as preceding crops obtained between 2003 and 2010 along with long-term soil sustainability parameters. The mean grain yields across both <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> of the organic cropping systems (BIODYN and BIOORG) were 64 % of CONFYM, whereas crude protein contents were 79 % of CONFYM at fertilisation level 2 and achieved 90 % at level 1. The main driving factor of lower yields was a reduction of the numbers of ears per m(2) and the thousand kernel weight. The apparent nitrogen use efficiency decreased with increasing N fertilisation. Doubling the organic fertilisation in the organic systems only slightly improved wheat grain yields but was not able to improve grain baking quality, due to low mineral N additions via slurry and farmyard manure. In contrast the effects of the preceding crop potatoes in comparison with preceding silage maize outperformed the organic fertilisation effects, resulting in 33 % higher yields and 11 % higher crude protein contents. The yield components recorded in the case of preceding potatoes demonstrated a more synchronised nutrient supply throughout the wheat development. Over all low input systems and both fertilisation levels in the conventional mixed farm system at half standard fertilisation (level 1) performed best with distinctly higher grain yields and crude protein contents than in the organic systems with standard fertilisation. However, all systems, organic and conventional, with the low or zero organic fertiliser inputs performed poorly considering the long-term soil quality parameters, indicating a degradation of soil quality. The DOK long-term experiment allows an integrated view on the performance of baking wheat production and long-term sustainability. The results emphasise the importance of a sufficient supply of soils with organic fertilisers as well as the need to improve the availability of organic nitrogen and synchrony between nutrient supply and demand in organic baking wheat production, beside the selection of a suitable preceding crop...|$|R

40|$|Biofertilisers are {{rhizosphere}} microorganisms inoculated {{to reduce}} the need for N or P fertiliser application and maximise plant growth and nutrition, resulting in greater grain yield and N or P content. This study aimed {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} diazotrophic bacteria isolated from the rhizosphere of wheat in Victoria, Australia. This thesis shows that N 2 -fixing Burkholderia species have great potential as biofertilisers on wheat productivity. In Chapter 2, strains of bacteria were isolated from wheat-growing soils in main Victoria wheat belt at Horsham and Birchip in North West Victoria. Strains were identified as Burkholderia spp. by their closest matches in the 16 S DNA and by morphology and physiology. In Chapter 3, one selected strain from each of Birchip and Horsham were used to inoculate wheat in a pot trial in a glasshouse during winter-spring. Soil was collected on site from wheat fields. Pots were inoculated with these strains to evaluate the effects of Burkholderia inoculum as biofertiliser on the plant growth and yield. Different nitrogen sources (urea 46 % N and ammonium sulphate 21 % N) were used as fertiliser at one of four levels (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N/ ha). There was a greater effect in Birchip than in Horsham soil and with ammonium sulphate than with urea due to waterlogying in Horsham soil. In Chapter 4, field-grown wheat was inoculated with the same strains of Burkholderia. Three experiments were carried out in plots at two sites, dryland and irrigated fields at Horsham and a dryland field at Birchip, during the winter wheat season of 2006, to evaluate the effect of Burkholderia species inoculum and different types of nitrogen source at one of four levels of added N (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg N/ha) on wheat growth and yield. The effects of both bacterial inoculation and N fertiliser on growth promotion and grain yield. Since 2006 was a year of drought, dry land crops were unsuccessful. Grain %N as well as total N content in grain per area in the Horsham irrigated field increased with increasing N <b>fertiliser</b> <b>levels</b> up to 100 kg N/ha. In Chapter 5, acetylene reduction (ARA) activity was measured in the pots for both inoculated and uninoculated plants at various growth stages and populations of nitrogen-fixing bacteria associated with the wheat roots and bulk soil were measured in addition to biomass and N content of plants and grain. Molecular tracing using specific primers showed that the inoculum was present only in inoculated treatments. Up to 60 % of the increased N content of the grain in inoculated plants was potentially derived from nitrogen fixed by the inoculum in the rhizosphere. It was concluded that the most significant result due to inoculation was the consistent maximal increase of N content in grain in inoculated treatments with ammonium sulphate fertiliser at 100 kg N/ha. Inoculation with Burkholderia consistently increased %N in wheat grain, with the potential benefit of decreasing the production cost and reducing use of chemical fertilisers...|$|R
