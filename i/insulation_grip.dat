40|$|The {{subject matter}} of this paper refers to the {{application}} of the acoustic emission method (AE) for the measurement and analysis of the pulses (AE) generated by surface partial discharges (SPD) occurring on bushing and stand-off insulators. Within the research work carried out, the results of which are presented in this paper, the AE pulses generated by SPDs were measured at meteorological and technical parameter changes for high-voltage experiments carried out. The range of the research work included the comparison of the time-frequency analysis results of the AE pulses generated by SPDs in a bushing insulator at the distance changes between an <b>insulation</b> <b>grip</b> and a ferrule, and at the internal electrode diameter changes. In Summing-up the comparative analysis was carried out for the results obtained in the time-frequency domain for bushing and stand-off insulators.

50|$|Special {{terminals}} are provided, {{which are}} inserted, using a special tool, into {{the holes in}} the prototyping board where components are to be fitted. Some boards are also available pre-populated with terminals. Each terminal is a metal tube with a component socket at one end and an insulation-displacement fork at the other. The component socket accepts a wire lead, such as the lead of a resistor or capacitor, or the leg of a 0.1-inch-pitch DIL package. The insulation-displacement fork accepts an insulated wire specially manufactured for the Speedwire system. The wire is pressed between the forks using a special tool. The forks cut through the <b>insulation</b> and <b>grip</b> the wire, making a gas-tight contact. The wire can then be cut off, or continued to another terminal. Wires can be pulled out of terminals and re-routed.|$|R
