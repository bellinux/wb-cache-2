40|$|The {{issue of}} cost and {{availability}} <b>of</b> <b>insurance,</b> particularly for tourism operators, {{has become a}} common issue for the tourism industry across European Union. It has been particularly problematic in those jurisdictions that have {{a high number of}} adventure and eco-tourism operators. The main challenge appears to be in relation to securing commercial general liability coverage and/or obtaining such coverage on a cost effective basis. One of the problems is that the tourism industry does not understand the insurance industry, and vice versa. In response to this situation, the EU institutions had created a series of publications dealing with risk management and insurance. Another important thing is how to make comparative analysis of threats in tourism and the adaptation of tourist products in tourism (accidents, treatment and medical transport costs, compensation duties with regard to the civil liability). Many insurance companies created general conditions of this kind <b>of</b> <b>insurance.</b> There are different types <b>of</b> the <b>insurance</b> in tourism, voluntary and compulsory insurance, individual or group insurance contract. The terms and conditions of this type <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> are defined in the insurance contract. Also the entities and the insurance event are specified in the contract. In that document, we can also find the duties of the insurer and the insurance company. Most insurance companies in EU have similar treatment of the costs abroad, also the transport to the native country, the stay of the closest person, rescue and search operation costs in the European Union and non- European countries. The question is how the assistance insurance in travel functions practically. Also the question is of the exclusion <b>of</b> <b>insurance</b> protection and the <b>insurance</b> <b>of</b> civil liability. Another important thing is the practice <b>of</b> the <b>insurance</b> <b>of</b> the property, <b>transport</b> <b>insurance</b> in travel, <b>insurance</b> <b>of</b> the organizer and a tourist middleman and costs of resigning from the participation in the trip and an earlier return and the...|$|R

The key factor to the optimal operation of multimodal transportation is the multimodal transport operator. It is up to this individual to compensate for various unpredictable circumstances, the complexity of the business processes, nature’s whims and carelessness. He must also organize and execute multimodal transport in all stages. Due to the above mentioned dangers and the fact that the area <b>of</b> liability <b>insurance</b> for multimodal transport operators is still being neglected, this article raises some valid points in favour of a proposal that would cover all of the {{transportation means}} as well as all the accompanying activities with a single insurance policy. The model includes 17 elements <b>of</b> liability <b>insurance</b> for a multimodal transport operator and all values which quantify the insurance elements in 2009 as well as the projected values for 2015, when progress is expected in the areas pertaining to the implementation of economical processes concerning transit development, as well as values for 2025, representing a period of innovation, reconstruction, optimization and modernization. With this supposed model for liability <b>insurance</b> <b>of</b> a multimodal <b>transport</b> operator, the foundation is laid for a liability insurance which would be used by a multimodal transport operator.
