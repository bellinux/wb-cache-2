40|$|Sinks {{of methane}} (CH 4) become highly {{variable}} due to both human activity and climate change. An urgent need therefore exists to budget key sinks of CH 4, such as forests and grasslands. In this study, CH 4 uptake of forests and grasslands in China was first reviewed and then estimated {{based upon the}} review itself. Total uptake from the two CH 4 sinks were 1. 323 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1) in China (ranging from 0. 567 to 2. 078 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1)), lower than a previous estimate in China (2. 56 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1)). Among the uptake, 0. 650 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1) (ranging from 0. 168 to 1. 132 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1)) was consumed by grasslands and 0. 675 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1) (ranging from 0. 399 to 0. 946 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1)) by forests. The largest CH 4 uptake of grasslands {{was found in the}} Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau High-Frigid Domain, which consumed 0. 284 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1), about 44 % of the whole uptake of grasslands in China. The greatest CH 4 uptake (0. 553 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1)) of forests took place in Eastern Humid and Semi-humid Domain of the country, which was about 82 % of the total annual CH 4 uptake of forests in China. With forests and grasslands taken together, Eastern Humid and Semi-humid Domain was the largest CH 4 consumer, taking up about 0. 715 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1), accounting for 82 % of the whole <b>forest</b> <b>uptake</b> and 25 % of the whole grassland uptake in China. On the ecoregion scale, due to extensive forest distribution and longer growing season, Southern Asia monsoon broadleaf forest ecoregion was the greatest CH 4 uptake (0. 320 Tg CH 4 yr(- 1)) of forests and grasslands in China, consuming more CH 4 than the Northeastern Arid and Semi-arid Domain combined. Our results indicated that forests and grasslands are not constant sinks of CH 4 but decreasing ones influenced by climate change and anthropogenic activity. More field data, mechanism understanding and process-based models could help better estimate and understand CH 4 uptakes of forests and grasslands in China. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Issue Briefs are timely summaries of research reports relevant to current natural resource topics. SUMMARY The U. S. forest sector (forest management and wood products manufacturing) sequesters enough carbon each year to offset 10 % of the nation’s carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions. Managing <b>forests</b> to <b>uptake</b> and store more atmospheric carbon adds another dimension to the enduring question, when should trees be cut? One strategy is harvesting at an old age or not at all. Although young <b>forests</b> <b>uptake</b> carbon faster, old forests store more carbon. Very old forests {{reach a point where}} carbon flux becomes negative as CO 2 expired during respiration and decomposition exceeds CO 2 uptake. A second strategy is periodic timber harvesting to manufacture wood products that substitute for concrete and steel building materials, thereby displacing fossil fuel energy use and emissions. This strategy will sequester more carbon than the no harvest choice in high productivity forests. The no harvest choice sequesters more carbon in low productivity forests or when energy displacement is inefficient. A third high payoff strategy is reducing the extent of wildfire...|$|R

During production seasons 2005 - 2007 mean daily net ecosystem production was 22 kg C ha- 1, and mean production season duration was 240 days. During production seasons there occurred days with respiration higher than assimilation, thus the forest was source of the atmospheric carbon. There were 45, 68 and 39 days in production seasons 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively, when the forest was carbon source. It was caused by 1) significant decrease of air temperature and low intensity of PAR {{at the beginning and}} end of production seasons; 2) low radiation in overcast days and 3) long dry period with high intensity of direct radiation and high air temperature during production seasons...|$|R

Therefore, <b>forest</b> carbon <b>uptake,</b> by means of photosynthesis, and the factors that affect it are important parameters for climate models. Modeling photosynthesis requires values of rate of carboxylation (Vcmax) and electron transport capacity (Jmax), both {{of which can be}} derived from gas exchange measurements based on the Farquhar, von Caemmerer and Berry (FvCB) model of photosynthesis. In this study, A/Ci curve analysis was done in Northern lower Michigan for two late successional species, red oak (Quercus rubra) and red maple (Acer rubrum), and one early successional species, bigtooth aspen (Populus grandidentata). Samples were taken across different canopy levels and temperatures to determine the effects on photosynthetic activity. It was found that for Vcmax, species was not significant and canopy was only significant for red oak. For Jmax, species was significant and canopy was significant for both red oak and red maple. Further analysis suggested that the Jmax species differences were likely attributable to canopy differences These results suggest the importance of canopy structure in determining the photosynthetic activity, and therefore carbon <b>uptake,</b> of <b>forests.</b> Consequently, it also implies that changes to forest composition have the potential to cause changes in the carbon <b>uptake</b> of the <b>forest...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} phenological events exerts a strong control over {{ecosystem}} function {{and leads to}} multiple feedbacks to the climate system. Phenology is inherently sensitive to temperature (although the exact sensitivity is disputed) and recent warming {{is reported to have}} led to earlier spring, later autumn and increased vegetation activity. Such greening could be expected to enhance ecosystem carbon uptake, although reports also suggest decreased <b>uptake</b> for boreal <b>forests.</b> Here we assess changes in phenology of temperate forests over the eastern US during the past two decades, and quantify the resulting changes in forest carbon storage. We combine long-term ground observations of phenology, satellite indices, and ecosystem-scale carbon dioxide flux measurements, along with 18 terrestrial biosphere models. We observe a strong trend of earlier spring and later autumn. In contrast to previous suggestions we show that carbon uptake through photosynthesis increased considerably more than carbon release through respiration for both an earlier spring and later autumn. The terrestrial biosphere models tested misrepresent the temperature sensitivity of phenology, and thus the effect on carbon uptake. Our analysis of the temperature-phenology-carbon coupling suggests a current and possible future enhancement of <b>forest</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> due to changes in phenology. This constitutes a negative feedback to climate change, and is serving to slow the rate of warming. 7 page(s...|$|R
40|$|There {{is general}} {{agreement}} that terrestrial {{systems in the}} Northern Hemisphere provide a significant sink for atmospheric CO 2; however, estimates of the magnitude and distribution of this sink vary greatly. National forest inventories provide strong, measurement-based constraints on the magnitude of net <b>forest</b> carbon <b>uptake.</b> We brought together forest sector C budgets for Canada, the United States, Europe, Russia, and China that were derived from forest inventory information, allometric relationships, and supplementary data sets and models. Together, these suggest that northern forests and woodlands provided a total sink for 0. 6 – 0. 7 Pg of C per year (1 Pg = 1015 g) during the early 1990 s, consisting of 0. 21 Pg C/yr in living biomass, 0. 08 Pg C/yr in forest products, 0. 15 Pg C/yr in dead wood, and 0. 13 Pg C/yr in the forest floor and soil organic matter. Estimates of changes in soil C pools have improved but remain the least certain terms of the budgets. Over 80 % of the estimated sink occurred in one-third of the forest area, in temperate regions affected by fire suppression, agricultural abandonment, and plantation forestry. Growth in boreal regions was offset by fire and other disturbances that vary considerably from year to year.

40|$|When {{stressed}} by low soil water content (SWC) or high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), plants close stomata, reducing transpiration and photosynthesis. However, it {{has historically been}} difficult to disentangle the magnitudes of VPD compared to SWC limitations on ecosystem-scale fluxes. We used a 13 [*]year record of eddy covariance measurements from a forest in south central Indiana, USA, to quantify how transpiration and photosynthesis respond to fluctuations in VPD versus SWC. High VPD and low SWC both explained reductions in photosynthesis relative to its long-term mean, as well as reductions in transpiration relative to potential transpiration estimated with the Penman-Monteith equation. Flux responses to typical fluctuations in SWC and VPD had similar magnitudes. Integrated over the year, VPD fluctuations accounted for significant reductions of GPP in both nondrought and drought years.

The strong biosphere-atmosphere interaction is a key component of the ecosystem functioning. Two aerosol components are the most visible: The natural biogenic emissions of particles and VOCs, and the biomass burning emissions. Two aerosol and trace gases monitoring stations were operated for 4 years in Manaus and Porto Velho, two very distinct sites, with different land use change. Manaus is a very clean and pristine site and Porto Velho is representative of heavy land use change in Amazonia. Aerosol composition, optical properties, size distribution, vertical profiling and optical depth were measured from 2008 to 2012. Aerosol radiative forcing was calculated over large areas. It was observed that the natural biogenic aerosol has significant absorption properties. Organic aerosol dominates the aerosol mass with 80 to 95 %. Light scattering and light absorption shows an increase by factor of 10 from Manaus to Porto Velho. Very few new particle formation events were observed. Strong links between aerosols and VOC emissions were observed. Aerosol radiative forcing in Rondonia shows a high - 15 watts/m² during the dry season of 2010, showing the large impacts of aerosol loading in the Amazonian ecosystem.

Yet {{the extent to which}} topography regulates montane <b>forest</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> and storage remains poorly understood. To address this knowledge gap, we compared forest aboveground carbon loading to topographic metrics describing energy balance and water availability across three headwater catchments of the Boulder Creek Watershed, Colorado, USA. The catchments range from 1800 to 3500 m above mean sea level with 46 - 102 cm/yr mean annual precipitation and - 1. 2 degrees to 12. 3 degrees C mean annual temperature. In all three catchments, we found mean forest carbon loading consistently increased from ridges (27 +/- 19 Mg C ha) to valley bottoms (60 +/- 28 Mg C ha). Low topographic positions held up to 185 +/- 76 Mg C ha, more than twice the peak value of upper positions. Toe slopes fostered disproportionately high net carbon uptake relative to other topographic positions. Carbon storage was on average 20 - 40 Mg C ha greater on north to northeast aspects than on south to southwest aspects, a pattern most pronounced in the highest elevation, coldest and wettest catchment. Both the peak and mean aboveground carbon storage of the three catchments, crossing an 11 degrees C range in temperature and doubling of local precipitation, defied the expectation of an optimal elevation-gradient climatic zone for net primary production. These results have important implications for models of forest sensitivity to climate change, as well as to predicted estimates of continental carbon reservoirs...|$|R
40|$|Human {{activities}} have greatly altered global carbon (C) and N (N) cycling. In fact, atmospheric concentrations {{of carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) have increased 40 % {{over the last century}} and the amount of N cycling in the biosphere has more than doubled. In an effort to understand how plants will respond to continued global carbon dioxide fertilization, long-term free-air CO 2 enrichment (FACE) experiments have been conducted at sites around the globe. Here we examine how atmospheric CO 2 enrichment and N fertilization affects the uptake of silicon (Si) in the Duke Forest, North Carolina, a stand dominated by Pinus taeda (loblolly pine), and five hardwood species. Specifically, we measured foliar biogenic silica (BSi) concentrations in five deciduous and one coniferous species across three treatments: CO 2 enrichment, N enrichment, and N and CO 2 enrichment. We found no consistent trends in foliar Si concentration under elevated CO 2, N fertilization, or combined elevated CO 2 and N fertilization. However, two-thirds of the tree species studied here have Si foliar concentrations greater than well-known Si accumulators, such as grasses. Based on net primary production values and aboveground Si concentrations in these trees, we calculated <b>forest</b> Si <b>uptake</b> rates under control and elevated CO 2 concentrations. Due largely to increased primary production, elevated CO 2 enhanced the magnitude of Si uptake between 20 % and 26 %, likely intensifying the terrestrial silica pump. This uptake of Si by forests has important implications for Si export from terrestrial systems, with the potential to impact C sequestration and higher trophic levels in downstream ecosystems...|$|R

The results obtained with 32 P {{were similar to those}} with 15 N but showed a higher variability, probably due to the lower mobility of P than N in soil and thus the labeling of a smaller soil volume with 32 P. During the dry season, topsoil root activity measured with 15 N was around 80 % for all species {{with the exception of the}} palm tree Bactris gasipaes Kunth., which had a higher uptake from 0. 6 m (50 %) than from 0. 1 m (30 %). The subsoil (1. 5 m) root activity was higher, when Bactris was not regularly cut for heart of palm harvest but grown for fruit production. Additionally, relative subsoil root activity of Theobroma increased and topsoil root activity of both Bactris and Theobroma decreased when intercropped in comparison to the monoculture. During the rainy season, the topsoil tree root activity slightly increased attributable to increasing water availability near the soil surface. The lowest isotope enrichment was noted for the secondary forest trees despite their low above ground biomass.

40|$|The {{question}} of long-term carbon <b>uptake</b> by old-growth <b>forests</b> has lead to extensive debate between modelling and experimental {{communities in the}} past. Based on so-called “carbon pool models”, where the soil carbon {{is assumed to be}} distributed among different pools, and to decay according to a first-order kinetic with pool-specific turnover constants, large factions of the modelling community have put forward a strong case that there cannot be long-term uptake of carbon by ecosystems because there is a limit defined by the steady state where total input equals total efflux of carbon. However, this theoretical deduction from first-order kinetic pool models seems to contradict a number of observations where long-term carbon uptake has been perceived. In this chapter, however, we will show that the modelling view stated here is completely contingent on the first-order reaction kinetics paradigm, and that there exist both old and recent alternative model formulations predicting that, under certain conditions, soil carbon pools never reach a steady state. Hence, from a modelling point of view, there is no justification for excluding the possibility of long-term old-growth <b>forest</b> carbon <b>uptake.</b> Since several plausible model formulations currently exist, in particular new models that include the role of soil microbial limitations, we need initiatives and experimental designs that can distinguish between, and potentially exclude, the respective decomposition modelling paradigms. From the perspective of scientific theory, this example reminds us that models should never be confounded with the truth and that they must be critically examined and tested again and again. Otherwise models can turn into fairy tales...|$|R

In this paper, the sensitivity Of MAKEDEP to various amounts and timing of N availability, including increased supplies of N prior to air pollution assuming increased biological N- 2 fixation, was assessed in a small hardwood stand of southern Quebec. The scenarios of N cycling were validated for burned and unburned conditions based on the simulated tree growth and N leaching rates {{as well as the}} model's ability to recreate the trends in atmospheric deposition of major ions in northeastern North America.

Modifying the amounts of N made available prior to air pollution was also necessary for the trees to grow to reasonable values before 1900.

40|$|Soils are {{responsible}} for storing up to 75 % of <b>forest</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> making them extremely large carbon pools. However, soil carbon is eventually released to the atmosphere by below ground respiration, consisting of soil respiration (microbial activity) and root respiration, which is influenced by environmental climate variables (soil temperature and moisture), soil characteristics (chemical and physical properties) and stand characteristics (stand age). We investigated the impact of stand age of cool temperate mountain ash forests (E. regnans) in Wallaby Creek, Victoria on carbon cycling between the soil and atmosphere using a chronosequence of three sites of different ages (regrowth from bushfires in 1730, 1926 and 1983). Below ground respiration was measured between January (Summer) and May (Autumn) in 2005 across all three sites, with the highest rates found in the old growth forest (5. 3 μmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1) and with lowest rates in the youngest site (2. 9 μmol CO 2 m- 2 s- 1). Within sites, below ground respiration rates increased with temperature, with Q 10 values ranging between 1. 42 and 1. 55. Rates were further influenced by soil moisture, and soil physical and chemical properties, including root biomass and levels of soil carbon. Litterfall was also measured and was highest at the youngest site (140 g biomass m- 2 month- 1) and lowest (92 g biomass m- 2 month- 1) at the old growth site.

40|$|Recent severe {{droughts}} in Europe, Russia, China, and North America {{have caused}} widespread decline of agricultural yield and reduction of <b>forest</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> {{during the past}} decade. During droughts plants limit their water-loss {{at the expense of}} carbon uptake by partially closing their stomata, which increases the intrinsic water-use efficiency defined as the ratio of gross primary production to stomatal conductance. Here we present new evidence on this drought response of terrestrial vegetation derived from year-to-year changes in the 13 C: 12 C stable isotope ratio in atmospheric CO 2 (δ 13 C). Observations from more than 50, 000 flask samples from a global monitoring network show a strong increase in water-use efficiency over continent-wide scales during severe droughts in Europe (2003, 2006), Russia (2010), and the United States (2002). This large-scale area-integrated vegetation drought response can not be measured from laboratory experiments or local-scale field studies and the atmospheric δ 13 C record thus offers a unique perspective on large-scale vegetation drought dynamics. Independent evidence from multiple eddy-covariance sites supports our inverse model interpretation of the observed global atmospheric δ 13 C record. With the parameterized stomatal conductance and soil moisture response used in our study, as well as many current climate models, our vegetation model underestimates this increase in water-use efficiency during severe droughts. We therefore suggest minor modifications to better reproduce the observations. We conclude that the global δ 13 C record provides a new opportunity to test and improve interannual drought dynamics in coupled biosphere-atmosphere models for CO 2...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of {{sources and sinks}} of carbon over the land surface is dominated by changes in land use such as deforestation, reforestation, and agricultural management. Despite, the importance of land-use change in dominating long-term net terrestrial fluxes of carbon, estimates of the annual flux are uncertain relative to other terms in the global carbon budget. The interaction of the nitrogen cycle via atmospheric N inputs and N limitation with the carbon cycle contributes to the uncertain effect of land use change on terrestrial carbon uptake. This study uses two different land use datasets to force the geographically explicit terrestrial carbon-nitrogen coupled component of the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM) to examine the response of terrestrial carbon stocks to historical LCLUC (cropland, pastureland and wood harvest) while accounting for changes in N deposition, atmospheric CO 2 and climate. One of the land use datasets is based on satellite data (SAGE) while the other uses population density maps (HYDE), which allows this study to investigate how global LCLUC data construction can affect model estimated emissions. The timeline chosen for this study starts before the Industrial Revolution in 1765 to the year 2000 because {{of the influence of}} rising population and economic development on regional LCLUC. Additionally, this study evaluates the impact that resulting secondary forests may have on terrestrial carbon uptake. The ISAM model simulations indicate that uncertainties in net terrestrial carbon fluxes during the 1990 s are largely due to uncertainties in regional LCLUC data.

40|$|Chronically {{elevated}} nitrogen (N) deposition has led {{to severe}} nutrient imbalance in forest soils. Particularly in tropical and subtropical forest ecosystems, increasing N loading has aggravated phosphorus (P) limitation of biomass production, and has resulted in elevated emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O) and reduced uptake of methane (CH 4), {{both of which are}} important greenhouse gases. Yet, the interactions of N and P and their effects on greenhouse gas emissions remain elusive. Here, we report N 2 O and CH 4 emissions together with soil N and P data for a period of 18  months following a single P addition (79  kg P ha − 1, as NaH 2 PO 4 powder) to an N-saturated, Masson pine-dominated forest soil at TieShanPing (TSP), Chongqing, south-western (SW) China. We observed a significant decline in both nitrate (NO 3 −) concentrations in soil water (5 and 20  cm depths) and in soil N 2 O emissions, following P application. We hypothesise that enhanced N uptake by plants in response to P addition, resulted in less available NO 3 − for denitrification. By contrast to most other forest ecosystems, TSP is a net source of CH 4. P addition significantly decreased CH 4 emissions and turned the soil from a net source into a net sink. Based on our observation and previous studies in South America and China, we believe that P addition relieves N inhibition of CH 4 oxidation. Within the 1. 5  years after P addition, no significant increase of forest growth was observed and P stimulation of <b>forest</b> N <b>uptake</b> by understorey vegetation remains to be confirmed.

The study took place in two contrasting forests: a red pine stand and a mixed deciduous stand (predomi-nantly oak) at the Harvard Forest, Massachusetts, USA. We used TRACE, a dynamic simulation model of ecosystem biogeochemistry that includes 15 N/ 14 N ratios in N pools and fluxes. We simulated input– output and internal fluxes of N, tracing the labeled cohorts of N inputs through ecosystem pools for one decade. TRACE simulated the peaks and timing of 15 N recovery in foliage well, providing a key link be-tween modeling and field studies. Recovery of tracers in fine roots was captured less well. The model was structured to provide rapid, initial sinks for 15 NO 32 and 15 NH 41 in both forests, as indicated by field data.

As a matter of fact, forest expansion is the only natural process that may counteract the consumption of the ecosystem capital and ecosystems services of rural lands due to uncontrolled urban sprawl. The paper addresses this topic in the paradigmatic case study of the countryside of Rome (Italy), characterized by counter dynamics of forest expansion and suburbanization. Morphological Spatial Pattern Analysis (MSPA) is applied to classify the forest landscape structure twice (1974 and 2008) according to seven categories (core, islet, perforation, edge, loop, bridge, branch) with different potential functional role as elements of a green infrastructure. Main findings are: (i) forest cover increased from 11 % to 16 % between 1974 and 2008; <b>forest</b> land <b>uptake</b> exceeds 4 % of total study area, but shows a slower pace than the growth of built-up areas (10 %); (ii) forest expansion has been to a large extent achieved by “sprawling” of islets (1. 6 % of the study area) along the stream network; (iii) more compact forest expansion has taken place on 0. 2 % of the study area in the form of additions to existing core areas or creation of new ones and (iv) the establishment of a network of protected areas nearby Rome has played a key role for the conservation and further expansion of core areas; yet, local loss of 1974 core areas stocks in a few protected areas indicates need of further law enforcement to ensure effective protection of the natural capital from degradation processes or even land conversion into built-up areas. Results calls for future in-depth investigations on the quality of newly created or maintained forest resource stocks associated to different spatial pattern structures. Integrated spatial planning strategies are outlined for the conservation of ecosystem capital and ecosystems services provided by forests, as major components of Rome’s green infrastructure.

Methods The model was upgraded from a monthly (3 -PG) to a daily time step (3 -PGday), and a soil water balance routine was included to better represent soil water availability. The model was evaluated against seasonal GPP and NEE dynamics from eddy covariance measurements. & Results Simulated and measured soil water content values were congruent throughout the study period for both forest types. 3 -PGday effectively described the following: GPP and NEE seasonal patterns; the transition of forest ecosystems from carbon sink to carbon source; however, the model overestimated diurnal ecosystem respiration values and failed to predict ecosystem respiration peaks. Conclusions The model served as a rather effective tool to represent seasonal variation in gross primary productivity, and ecosystem net carbon uptake under Mediterranean droughtprone conditions. However, its semi-empirical nature and the simplicity inherent in the original model formulation are obstacles preventing the model working well for short-term daily predictions...|$|R
40|$|We use a {{terrestrial}} carbon-nitrogen cycle {{component of}} the Integrated Science Assessment Model (ISAM) to investigate the impacts of nitrogen dynamics on regrowing secondary forests over the 20 th century. We further examine what the impacts of nitrogen deposition and land use change history are on terrestrial carbon uptake since preindustrial time. Our results suggest that global total net land use emissions for the 1990 s associated with changes in cropland, pastureland, and wood harvest are 1. 22 GtC/yr. Without considering the secondary forest regrowth, the estimated net global total land use emissions are 1. 58 GtC/yr or about 0. 36 GtC/yr higher than if secondary forest regrowth is considered. Results also show that without considering the nitrogen dynamics and deposition, the estimated global total secondary forest sink for the 1990 s is 0. 90 GtC/yr or about 0. 54 GtC/yr higher than estimates that include the impacts of nitrogen dynamics and deposition. Nitrogen deposition alone is responsible for about 0. 13 GtC/yr of the total secondary forest sink. While nitrogen is not a limiting nutrient in the intact primary forests in tropical regions, our study suggests that nitrogen becomes a limiting nutrient for regrowing secondary forests of the tropical regions, in particular Latin America and Tropical Africa. This is because land use change activities, especially wood harvest, removes large amounts of nitrogen from the system when slash is burnt or wood is removed for harvest. However, our model results show that carbon uptake is enhanced in the tropical secondary forests of the Indian region. We argue {{that this may be}} due to enhanced nitrogen mineralization and increased nitrogen availability following land use change in the Indian tropical forest ecosystems. Results also demonstrate that there is a significant amount of carbon accumulating in the Northern Hemisphere where most land use changes and forest regrowth has occurred in recent decades. This study indicates the significance of secondary forests to terrestrial carbon sinks, the importance of nitrogen dynamics to the magnitude of secondary <b>forests</b> carbon <b>uptake,</b> and therefore the need to include both primary and secondary forests and nitrogen dynamics in terrestrial ecosystem models...|$|R
40|$|We {{measured}} {{the impacts of}} prescribed fire and small clear-cut tree harvesting on carbon dynamics in a mixed-conifer forest in the central Sierra Nevada. Soil CO 2 efflux, above ground tree biomass, annual tree radial growth, and ecosystem carbon stored as litter, fine root and in the mineral soil were measured in four treatment sites: an un-manipulated control, a prescribed fire site, and two harvested sites, in one of which the soil was mechanically ripped to reduce soil compaction, a common practice done on industrial forest lands in the Sierra Nevada. Biomass and radial tee growth was also measured in a thinned site and a thinned and burned site. The biomass was determined one year before treatment, in 2001 one year after, in 2003, and finally seven year after treatment in 2009. Treatments affected pools and exchanges of carbon, reducing biomass stocks and {{the capacity of the}} <b>forest</b> to <b>uptake</b> carbon, but also to released C from the soil surface. Soil respiration was decreased by both fire and harvest (circa 20 %), in part because the disturbances altered energy input and water availability. Prescribed fire and thinning reduced stand biomass, removing mostly small unselected (fire) or selected (thinning) trees. The thinning effects were concentrated in the first post-treatment year, whereas fire effects on tree radial growth showed responses between the first and the seventh years after fire. In the seven years post-disturbance interval, fire decreased tree density 30 %, radial growth 12 %, and stand radial growth 27 %. Thinning reduced only 9 % tree density, and increased tree radial growth 20 % and stand radial growth 6 %, compared to the control site. Effects of fire and thinning on biomass and biomass productivity were similar. After seven years, the biomass of both the fire and the thinned site reached pre-treatment levels. Excluding the first post-disturbance year, the thinned site stored more carbon than the control site, were radial growth has being declining over the same period. The effects of fire combined with thinning were higher than for the singe treatment, and growth, biomass and productivity were decreased between 30 and 40 % compared to the control site...|$|R
40|$|As {{length and}} timing of the growing season are major factors {{explaining}} differences in carbon exchange of ecosystems, we analyzed seasonal patterns of net ecosystem carbon exchange (FNEE) using eddy covariance data of the FLUXNET data base ([URL] The study included boreal and temperate, deciduous and coniferous forests, Mediterranean evergreen systems, rainforest, native and managed temperate grasslands, tundra, and C 3 and C 4 crops. Generalization of seasonal patterns are useful for identifying functional vegetation types for global dynamic vegetation models, {{as well as for}} global inversion studies, and can help improve phenological modules in SVAT or biogeochemical models. The results of this study have important validation potential for global carbon cycle modeling. The phasing of respiratory and assimilatory capacity differed within forest types: for temperate coniferous <b>forests</b> seasonal <b>uptake</b> and release capacities are in phase, for temperate deciduous and boreal coniferous forests, releasewas delayed compared to uptake. According to seasonal pattern of maximum nighttime release (evaluated over 15 -day periods, Fmax) the study sites can be grouped in four classes: (1) boreal and high altitude conifers and grasslands; (2) temperate deciduous and temperate conifers; (3) tundra and crops; (4) evergreen Mediterranean and tropical forests. Similar results are found for maximum daytime uptake (Fmin) and the integral net carbon flux, but temperate deciduous forests fall into class 1. For forests, seasonal amplitudes of Fmax and Fmin increased in the order tropical 3 ̆c Mediterranean and temperate coniferous 3 ̆c temperate deciduous and boreal forests, and the pattern seems relatively stable for these groups. The seasonal amplitudes of Fmax and Fmin are largest for managed grasslands and crops. Largest observed values of Fmin varied between − 48 and − 2 μmolm- 2 s- 1, decreasing in the order C 4 -crops 3 ̆e C 3 -crops 3 ̆e temperate deciduous forests 3 ̆e temperate conifers 3 ̆e boreal conifers 3 ̆e tundra ecosystems. Due to data restrictions, our analysis centered mainly on Northern Hemisphere temperate and boreal forest ecosystems. Grasslands, crops, Mediterranean ecosystems, and rainforests are under-represented, as are savanna systems, wooded grassland, shrubland, or year-round measurements in tundra systems. For regional or global estimates of carbon sequestration potentials, future investigations of eddy covariance should expand in these systems...|$|R
40|$|Boreal forests play a {{key role}} in the global carbon cycle and are facing rapid shifts in {{nitrogen}} availability with poorly understood consequences for ecosystem function and global climate change. We quantified the effects of increasing nitrogen availability on carbon fluxes from a relatively understudied component of these forests - the forest floor - at three intervals over the summer growing period in a northern Swedish Scots pine stand. Nitrogen addition altered both the uptake and release of carbon dioxide from the forest floor, but the magnitude and direction of this effect depended on the time during the growing season and the amount of nitrogen added. Specifically, nitrogen addition stimulated net <b>forest</b> floor carbon <b>uptake</b> only in the late growing season. We find evidence for species-specific control of forest floor carbon sink strength, as photosynthesis per unit ground area was positively correlated only with the abundance of the vascular plant Vaccinium myrtillus and no others. Comparison of understorey vegetation photosynthesis and respiration from the study site indicates that understorey vegetation photosynthate was mainly supplying respiratory demands for much of the year. Only in the late season with nitrogen addition did understorey vegetation appear to experience a large surplus of carbon in excess of respiratory requirements. Further work, simultaneously comparing all major biomass and respiratory carbon fluxes in forest floor and tree vegetation, is required to resolve the likely impacts of environmental changes on whole-ecosystem carbon sequestration in boreal forests...|$|R
40|$|The {{accumulation}} and cycling {{of nutrients}} in planted forest {{is essential to}} the establishment of management practices that can lead to the sustainable production of the <b>forest</b> site. The <b>uptake,</b> accumulation and release of nutrients depend on tree age and stage of development. The knowledge of accumulation and cycling of nutrients allows the estimation of output and replacement of nutrients to the forest site. This makes it possible to correct nutritional disorders caused by the use of inadequate management techniques. The usual method of sampling biomass and nutrients is always destructive making it impossible to establish permanent plots for nutritional monitoring. This study aimed at selecting models to estimate the biomass (volume and weight) and the nutrient contents {{in different parts of the}} trunk of Eucalyptus grandis, and reducing costs of sampling and analysis. Forty-five trees were selected from the dominant class (15 trees), co-dominant (15 trees) and suppressed (15 trees) in commercial plantations of E. grandis at ages 3, 5 and 7 years, in the municipality of Itatinga, SP, Brazil. Samples were taken of bark, sapwood and heartwood separately. Models to estimate volume and weight in the different components of the trunk were generated from the diameter at breast height (dbh) using regression analysis. Models to estimate content of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in the bark, sapwood and heartwood from the nutrient contents in a section of the trunk were also defined, so enabling a recommendation for non-destructive sampling...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and methane (CH 4 ) are the {{two most}} {{important}} anthropogenic greenhouse gases contributing to global climate change. SCIAMACHY onboard ENVISAT (launch 2002) was the first and is now together with TANSO onboard GOSAT (launch 2009) the only satellite instrument currently in space whose measurements are sensitive to CO 2 and CH 4 concentration changes in the lowest atmospheric layers where the variability due to sources and sinks is largest. We present long-term SCIAMACHY retrievals (2003 – 2009) of column-averaged mole fractions of both gases (denoted XCO 2 and XCH 4 ) derived from absorption bands in the near-infrared/shortwave-infrared (NIR/SWIR) spectral region focusing on large-scale features. The results are obtained using an upgraded version (v 2) of the retrieval algorithm WFM-DOAS including several improvements, while simultaneously maintaining its high processing speed. The retrieved mole fractions are compared to global model simulations (CarbonTracker XCO 2 and TM 5 XCH 4 ) being optimised by assimilating highly accurate surface measurements from the NOAA/ESRL network and taking the SCIAMACHY averaging kernels into account. The comparisons address seasonal variations and long-term characteristics. The steady increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide primarily caused by the burning of fossil fuels can be clearly observed with SCIAMACHY globally. The retrieved annual mean XCO 2 increase over both hemispheres agrees with CarbonTracker within the error bars but is on average somewhat smaller (1. 8 ppm yr− 1 compared to 1. 9 ppm yr− 1 ). The amplitude of the XCO 2 seasonal cycle as retrieved by SCIAMACHY, which is 4. 3 ppm for the Northern Hemisphere and 1. 4 ppm for the Southern Hemisphere, is on average about 1 ppm larger than for CarbonTracker. An investigation of the boreal <b>forest</b> carbon <b>uptake</b> during the growing season via the analysis of longitudinal gradients shows good agreement between SCIAMACHY and CarbonTracker concerning the overall magnitude of the gradients and their annual variations. The retrieved XCH 4 results show that after years of stability, atmospheric methane has started to rise again in recent years which is consistent with surface measurements. The largest increase is observed for the tropics and northern mid- and high-latitudes amounting to about 8 ppb yr− 1 since 2007.

40|$|Rising {{atmospheric}} {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{is expected to}} increase forest productivity, resulting in greater carbon (C) storage in forest ecosystems. Because elevated atmospheric CO 2 does not increase nitrogen (N) use efficiency in many forest tree species, additional N inputs will be required to sustain increased net primary productivity (NPP) under elevated atmospheric CO 2. We investigated the importance of free amino acids (AAs) as a source for <b>forest</b> N <b>uptake</b> at the Duke Forest Free Air CO 2 Enrichment (FACE) site, comparing its importance with that of better-studied inorganic N sources. Potential proteolytic enzyme activity was monitored seasonally, and individual AA concentrations were measured in organic horizon extracts. Potential free AA production in soils ranged from 190 to 690 [*]nmol[*]N[*]g − 1 [*]h − 1 and was greater than potential rates of soil NH 4 + production. Because of this high potential rate of organic N production, we determined (1) whether intact AA uptake occurs by Pinus taeda L., the dominant tree species at the FACE site, (2) if the rate of cycling of AAs is comparable with that of ammonium (NH 4 +), and (3) if atmospheric CO 2 concentration alters the aforementioned N cycling processes. A field experiment using universally labeled ammonium (15 NH 4 +) and alanine (13 C 3 H 7 15 NO 2) demonstrated that 15 N is more readily taken up by plants and heterotrophic microorganisms as NH 4 +. Pine roots and microbes take up on average 2. 4 and two times as much NH 4 + 15 N compared with alanine 15 N 1 week after tracer application. N cycling through soil pools was similar for alanine and NH 4 +, with the greatest 15 N tracer recovery in soil organic matter, followed by microbial biomass, dissolved organic N, extractable NH 4 +, and fine roots. Stoichiometric analyses of 13 C and 15 N uptake demonstrated that both plants and soil microorganisms take up alanine directly, with a 13 C[*]:[*] 15 N ratio of 3. 3 [*]:[*] 1 in fine roots and 1. 5 [*]:[*] 1 in microbial biomass. Our results suggest that intact AA (alanine) uptake contributes substantially to plant N uptake in loblolly pine forests. However, we found no evidence supporting increased recovery of free AAs in fine roots under elevated CO 2, suggesting plants will need to acquire additional N via other mechanisms, such as increased root exploration or increased N use efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{relations}} among <b>forest</b> carbon (C) <b>uptake</b> and water use {{is critical for}} predicting forest-climate interactions. Although the basic properties of tree-water relations have long been known, our understanding of broader-scale patterns is limited by several factors including (1) incomplete understanding of drivers of change in coupled C and water fluxes and water use efficiency (WUE), (2) difficulty in reconciling WUE estimates obtained at different scales, and (3) uncertainty in how evapotranspiration (ET) and WUE vary with other important resources such as nitrogen (N). To address these issues, we examined ET, gross primary production (GPP), and WUE at 11 AmeriFlux sites across North America. Our analysis spanned leaf and ecosystem scales and included foliar δ 13 C, δ 18 O, and %N measurements; eddy covariance estimates of GPP and ET; and remotely sensed estimates of canopy %N. We used flux data to derive ecosystem WUE (WUEe) and foliar δ 13 C to infer intrinsic WUE. We found that GPP, ET, and WUEe scaled with canopy %N, even when environmental variables were considered, and discuss {{the implications of these}} relationships for forest-atmosphere-climate interactions. We observed opposing patterns of WUE at leaf and ecosystem scales and examined uncertainties to help explain these opposing patterns. Nevertheless, significant relationship between C isotope-derived ci/ca and GPP indicates that δ 13 C can be an effective predictor of forest GPP. Finally, we show that incorporating species functional traits—wood anatomy, hydraulic strategy, and foliar %N—into a conceptual model improved the interpretation of Δ 13 C and δ 18 O vis-à-vis leaf to canopy water-carbon fluxes...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of forests and terrestrial ecosystems to disturbance {{is an important}} process in the global carbon cycle {{in the context of}} a changing climate. blackThis study focuses on the effect of selective felling (thinning) at a managed forest site. Previous statistical analyses of eddy covariance data at the study site had found that disturbance from thinning resulted in no significant change to net ecosystem carbon uptake. In order to better understand the effect of thinning on carbon fluxes we use the mathematical technique of four-dimensional variational data assimilation. Data assimilation provides a compelling alternative to more common statistical analyses of flux data as it allows for the combination of many different sources of data, with the physical constraints of a dynamical model, to find an improved estimate blackof the state of a system. We develop blacknew observation operators to assimilate daytime and nighttime net ecosystem exchange observations with a daily time-step model, increasing blackobservations available by a factor of 4. 25. Our results support previous analyses, with a predicted net ecosystem carbon uptake for the year 2015 of 426 ± 116 g C m− 2 for the unthinned forest and 420 ± 78 g C m− 2 for the thinned forest despite a model-predicted reduction in gross primary productivity of 337 g C m− 2. We show that this is likely due to reduced ecosystem respiration post-disturbance compensating for a reduction in gross primary productivity. This supports the theory of an upper limit of <b>forest</b> net carbon <b>uptake</b> due to the magnitude of ecosystem respiration scaling with gross primary productivity...|$|R
