5|$|In January 2006, Disney bought Pixar in a {{deal that}} put Pixar chiefs Edwin Catmull and John Lasseter {{in charge of all}} Disney Animation. Shortly thereafter, Circle 7 Animation was shut down and <b>its</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> Toy Story 3 was cancelled. The {{following}} month, Disney CEO Robert Iger confirmed that Disney {{was in the process of}} transferring the production to Pixar. John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Lee Unkrich visited the house where they first pitched Toy Story and came up with the story for the film over a weekend. Stanton then wrote a treatment.|$|E

The EU's common EPS specification (EN 62684:2010) references the USB Battery Charging Specification and {{is similar to the}} GSMA/OMTP and Chinese charging solutions.

It was Ross's first professional-wrestling broadcast since his 2013 departure from WWE. Ross attempted to obtain Mike Tenay of Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) for color commentary, but TNA refused. Others considered for the job were John Pollock, Mauro Ranallo and Kevin Nash, before GFW settled on Matt Striker.|$|E

5|$|The French Limousin breed {{standard}} is applied by international breed associations in slightly different forms. These range from mandatory compliance before an animal can be recorded in a country's herd book (mainly European countries) to voluntary application in others. For example, in Belgium, application of its {{breed standard}} mirrors in most detail the French use, {{and in the}} UK, compliance with <b>its</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Limousin breed standard is required by the UK breed association's bye-laws.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. State Department, after {{closing the}} NTSB {{investigation}} {{on the grounds}} that it was not an accident, pursued an ICAO investigation instead. Commentators such as Johnson point out that this action was illegal, and that in deferring the investigation to the ICAO, the Reagan administration effectively precluded any politically or militarily sensitive information from being subpoenaed that might have embarrassed the administration or contradicted <b>its</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> events. Unlike the NTSB, ICAO can subpoena neither persons nor documents and is dependent on the governments involved—in this incident, the United States, the Soviet Union, Japan, and South Korea—to supply evidence voluntarily.|$|E
5|$|After Ultimecia is defeated, {{the time}} and space that she had absorbed begin to return to normal, pulling Squall's comrades back into their places in the timeline, while Squall returns to the orphanage and meets a younger Edea. Since {{she does not want}} to involve the children, she absorbs the dying Ultimecia's powers as part of the cycle of sorceresses (a sorceress must pass her powers to a {{successor}} before she can die peacefully). Squall plants the ideas for Garden and SeeD in her mind, creating an origin paradox: Squall must become leader of Balamb Garden so he can pass <b>its</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> SeeD tradition to Edea, who teaches them to her husband Cid (who co-founds Balamb Garden, which admits Edea's orphans—including Squall).|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the report}} {{produced}} by the OIR, by 1957 the CIA realized that <b>its</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> {{the history of the}} Árbenz government and the coup were not gaining traction. Books written by defenders of the Árbenz government, which were strongly critical of the US intervention, were generally better received. Nationalist Latin Americans were inclined to view the Castillo Armas government as a creation of the US. As a result, the US government decided to allow Ronald Schneider, a historian who {{was in the process of}} completing his Ph.D, to access the PBHistory archive. Scheider published Communism in Guatemala: 1944 to 1954 in 1959. Later observers have stated that the publication may have been subsidized in some way by the CIA: both the Foreign Policy Research Institute, where Schneider worked, and Frederick A. Praeger, who published Schneider's book, received CIA funds. Schneider stated in his book that the Comite was responsible for collecting the documents he accessed, but did not mention the CIA's role in funding the Comite, nor did he explain how the documents came to the US. Schneider's book did not rely on PBHistory material alone, but also on information that Schneider gathered during a trip to Mexico and Guatemala in 1957. The book was generally well received.|$|E
5|$|With Canada at war for {{the first}} time since <b>its</b> <b>version</b> <b>of</b> the Victoria Cross was created, {{preparations}} for a physical cast of the medal were initiated in 2006, when a committee called the Victoria Cross Production Planning Group was formed under the leadership of the Chancellery of Honours at Rideau Hall. It originally consisted of representatives from the Department of National Defence, Veterans Affairs Canada, and the Office of the Secretary to the Governor General of Canada, and the group later expanded to include individuals from the Department of Canadian Heritage, Natural Resources Canada, and the Royal Canadian Mint, with assistance provided by the Queen and the British Ministry of Defence. Following their research and deliberations, the first Victoria Cross decoration was struck in 2007, as confirmed by Deputy Herald Chancellor Emmanuelle Sajous, and the medal was officially released to the public on 16 May 2008 by Governor General Michaëlle Jean at Rideau Hall. It was one of 20 cast, each of which is composed of three groupings of metals: that of a Russian cannon captured at the siege of Sevastopol (18541855), donated by Queen Elizabeth II; a Confederation Medal, created to mark Canada's confederation in 1867; and a selection of metals from each of Canada's regions. These were cast, rather than struck, continuing the tradition started in the United Kingdom when it was found the metal alloy was too brittle for striking, and finished at the Royal Canadian Mint. The first two were sent to Buckingham Palace for addition to the British Royal Collection and other specimens were kept as part of the Crown Collection at Rideau Hall, as well as at the Department of National Defence, Library and Archives Canada, and the Canadian War Museum.|$|E
