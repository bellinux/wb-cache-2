40|$|Background: Community-oriented {{oral health}} {{programs}} are seldom found in India. When {{primary health care}} systems were in the 1980 s, dentistry was not adequately included. This has left oral health far behind other health services. Objectives: To find the availability of dental professionals, infrastructure, equipment, and treatments provided in <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> of Mangalore taluk. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among medical officers and dentists working in all the <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> of Mangalore taluk, using an interview schedule, the oral health care availability inventory (ORAI). Results: Among 23 <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> of Mangalore taluk, dental services were available at six <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> (26 %) [two community <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> (CHCs) and four primary <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> (PHCs) ]. Mouth mirrors, dental explorers, and extraction instruments were available at six <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> [two CHCs (100 %) and four PHCs (19 %) ]. No <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> provided orthodontic tooth corrections, removal of impacted teeth, oral biopsies, and fabrication of removable dentures. Conclusions: Availability of dental services was limited in the <b>health</b> <b>centers,</b> and {{a vast majority of}} the rural population in Mangalore taluk did not have access to dental care...|$|R

40|$|In Västerbotten County, Sweden, {{there are}} two <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> which (in {{contrast}} to all other <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> in the region) bear strict responsibility over their pharmaceutical budget.

Estimation results using matching methods, which allows us to compare similar patients at the different <b>health</b> <b>centers,</b> show that the introduction of fixed pharmaceutical budgets did not affect physicians' prescription behavior, indicating that fixed budgets {{may not be an}} efficient measure to reduce costs. Another explanation is that the <b>health</b> <b>centers</b> under study already had taken measures to contain costs, making it hard to further reduce costs...|$|R
