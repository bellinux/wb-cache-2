40|$|AbstractFor {{the first}} time, {{isothermal}} equiaxed solidification of a metallic alloy {{has been observed}} in situ in space, providing unique benchmark experimental data. The experiment was completed on board the MASER 13 sounding rocket, launched in December 2015, using a newly developed isothermal solidification furnace. A grain-refined Al– 20 wt%Cu sample was fully melted and solidified during 360 s of microgravity and the solidification sequence was recorded using time-resolved X-radiography. Equiaxed nucleation, dendritic growth, solutal impingement, and <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation</b> were thus observed in a gravity-free environment. Equiaxed nucleation was promoted through application of a controlled cooling rate of − 0. 05 K/s producing a 1 D grain density of ~ 6. 5 mm− 1, uniformly distributed throughout {{the field of view}} (FOV). Primary growth slowed to a visually imperceptible level at an estimated undercooling of 7 K, after which the cooling rate was increased to − 1. 0 K/s for the remainder of solidification and <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation,</b> ensuring the sample was fully solidified inside the microgravity time window. The <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation</b> commenced at the centre of the FOV proceeding radially outwards covering the entire FOV in ~ 3 sMicrogravity-based solidification is compared to an identical pre-flight ground-based experiment using the same sample and experiment timeline. The ground experiment was designed to minimise gravity effects, by choice of a horizontal orientation for the sample, so that any differences would be subtle. The first equiaxed nucleation occurred at an apparent undercooling of 0. 6 K less than the equivalent event during microgravity. During primary equiaxed solidification, as expected, no buoyant grain motion was observed during microgravity, compared to modest grain rotation and reorientation observed during terrestrial-based solidification. However, when the cooling rate was increased from − 0. 05 K/s to − 1. 0 K/s during the latter stages of solidification, in both 1 g and micro-g environments, some grain movement was apparent due to liquid feeding and mechanical impingement of neighbouring grains...|$|E

However, microstructural evolution and effects of processing parameters on phase selection during peritectic reaction are not well understood. In this paper Impulse-Atomization experiments and simulations were used to study rapid solidification of Al- 36 wt% Ni particles. Secondary dendrite arm spacing measurements were used to estimate the cooling rate achieved during the solidification of these particles. The weight fractions of the phases formed in different sizes of the particles were measured using neutron diffraction technique.

After the <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation,</b> crystals of α-Fe(B) phase are nucleated within the γ-Fe(B) phase with decreases of the temperature [25].

Additionally, solidification paths are simulated with a model previously validated for concurrent dendritic, peritectic and <b>eutectic</b> phase <b>transformations</b> in binary alloys. The measurements demonstrate a strong dependence of phase fractions on particle size, as well as an inversion of trends with composition.

40|$|We present {{adaptive}} {{finite element}} simulations of dendritic and eutectic solidification in binary and ternary alloys. The computations {{are based on}} a recently formulated phase-field model that is especially appropriate for modelling non-isothermal solidification in multicomponent multiphase systems. In this approach, a set of governing equations for the phase-field variables, for the concentrations of the alloy components and for the temperature has to be solved numerically, ensuring local entropy production and the conservation of mass and inner energy. To efficiently perform numerical simulations, we developed a numerical scheme to solve the governing equations using a finite element method on an adaptive non-uniform mesh with highest resolution in the regions of the phase boundaries. Simulation results of the solidification in ternary Ni$_{ 60 }$Cu$_{ 40 -x}$Cr$_{x}$ alloys are presented investigating the influence of the alloy composition on the growth morphology and on the growth velocity.

40|$|A diffuse-interface {{model for}} microstructures with an {{arbitrary}} number of components and phases was developed from basic thermodynamic and kinetic principles {{and applied to}} the study of ternary <b>eutectic</b> phase <b>transformations.</b> Gradients in composition and phase were included in the free energy functional, and a generalized diffusion potential equal to the chemical potential at equilibrium was defined as the driving force for diffusion. Problematic pair-wise treatment of phases at interfaces and triple junctions was avoided, and a cutoff barrier was introduced to constrain phase fractions to physically meaningful values. Parameters in the model were connected to experimentally measurable quantities. Numerical methods for solving the phase-field equations were investigated. Explicit finite difference suffered from stability problems while a semi-implicit spectral method was orders of magnitude more stable but potentially inaccurate. The source of error was found to be the rich temporal dynamics of spinodal decomposition combined with large timesteps and a first-order time integrator. The error was addressed with a second-order semi-implicit Runge-Kutta time integrator and adaptive timestepping, resulting in two orders of magnitude improvement in efficiency. A diffusion-limited growth instability in multiphase thin-film systems was discovered, highlighting how ternary systems differ from binary systems, and intricate asymmetries in the processes of solidification and melting were simulated. A nucleation barrier for solidification was observed and prompted development of a Monte-Carlo-like procedure to trigger nucleation. However when solid was heated from below the melting point, premelting was observed first at phase triple junctions and then at phase boundaries with stable liquid films forming under certain conditions. Premelting was attributed to the shape and position of the metastable liquid curve, which was found to affect microstructure by creating low energy pathways through composition space. Slow diffusivity in solid relative to liquid was shown to produce solutal melting of solid below the melting point. Finally, the multiphase method was used to produce the first reported simulation of the entire transient liquid phase bonding process.

Moreover, in order to obtain lower values of CTE it is better to concentrate carbon into spherical graphite phase than into γ-phase (γ-solid solution). Minimal thermal expansion of alloys is achieved after annealing at 800 °C during 3 hours. That mode of heat treatment ensures stable structural components (graphite and depleted in carbon γ-phase) which later stipulates minimal values of CTE.

40|$|The {{problem of}} weld {{cracking}} in {{austenitic stainless steels}} is introduced together with a survey of work carried out to try and explain the phenomenon. It is clear from this survey that although the problem is solvable by allowing {{a small amount of}} ferrite to appear in the final weld microstructure the detailed reasons for the cracking are still unknown - especially in the particular case of cast to cast variations. This thesis has looked at 6 alloys which are similar in composition, all bar one of which meet the AISI 316 specification. The initial premise was that some of these alloys would be easy to weld and that some would be prone to cracking. Experimental modelling (using a Quenched Directional Solidification or QDS technique) has been used to look at the detail of how the alloys solidified, with respect to the thermal properties, fraction solid against temperature, phase chemistry and microstructure. Sophisticated techniques much as electron probe microanalysis and computer controlled image analysis have been used to extract the results from these experiments. These models have been correlated {{with a small amount of}} weld testing using the 'Varestraint' process. The microstructural results revealed that all the alloys initially solidified as ferrite and underwent a transition to austenitic solidification as the temperature dropped. The transition between the two solidification modes varied in its suddenness - this appeared to be a function of the impurity content of the alloy. Analysis of the EPMA results showed that both <b>eutectic</b> and peritectic <b>transformation</b> reactions apparently occurred. The Clyne-Davies model of solidification cracking has been applied to experimentally determined fraction solid curves. This method provided some predictive insights and could usefully be more widely applied in technological cases to predict if a particular cast of material may be prone to weld cracking...|$|R

The estimated cooling rates are higher close to the rod surface (2952 – 3817 K∙s- 1) than in the rod axis (228 – 328 K∙s- 1), which indicates the dominant radial heat flow.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the lamellar growth of pearlite {{at the expense}} of austenite during the eutectoid transformation in steel. To begin with, we extend the Jackson-Hunt-type calculation (previously used to analyze <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation)</b> to eutectoid transformation by accounting for diffusion in all the phases. Our principal finding is that the growth rates in presence of diffusion in all the phases is different as compared to the case when diffusion in growing phases is absent. The difference in the dynamics is described by a factor 'ρ' which comprises of the ratio of the diffusivities of the bulk and the growing phases, along with the ratios of the slopes of the phase co-existence lines. Thereafter, we perform phase-field simulations, the results of which are in agreement with analytical predictions. The phase-field simulations also reveal that diffusion in austenite as well as ferrite leads to the formation of tapered cementite along with an overall increase in the transformation kinetics as compared to diffusion in austenite (only).

However, the effect of magnesium on the eutectic microstructure is unclear. The aim of the present work is to investigate the effect of magnesium on the eutectic microstructure and to clarify its role in the silicon solidification. Experiments were performed on hypoeutectic and eutectic alloys (Al- 7 %Si, Al- 11 %Si, Al- 13 %Si and 413. 2 alloys). Assessment of the eutectic microstructure was done using thermal analysis and metallography. The silicon phase was quantified by image analysis in terms of its perimeter, shape factor and aspect ratio. The results reveal that in hypoeutectic and eutectic synthetic alloys magnesium decreases the homogeneity of the microstructure. At about 1 %Wt Mg, however, magnesium refines slightly the silicon phase. It was found that magnesium has a negative effect on strontium modification, that is, it changes the microstructure from well modified to partially modified. This is believed due to the presence of a complex intermetallic compound $ rm(Mg sb 2 SrAl sb 4 Si sb 3) $ formed prior to the <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation.</b> It is suggested that magnesium not be added in excess of 0. 6 Wt% in strontium modified Al-Si alloys...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} stripping time,inoculation and melting temperature {{on the structure of}} metal mold cast iron,cast irons of Sc 0. 98, 0. 95, 0. 91 and 0. 87 were melted at 1500, 1420 and 1350 ℃ in a high frequency induction furnace and poured at about 1350 ℃　into　a　cylindrical　metal　mold　made　of cast iron. The mold was coated with soot of 0. lmm thickness and was preheated at 150 ℃　The results obtained were as follows:(1) In case of high Sc cast iron,stripping at the early period of casting had a favourable effect on reducing the chitling tendency of castings,while in case of lower Sc the effect was insufficient. (2) Microstructure of castings chnged with varying stripping time. The change of microstructure was caused due to variation of solidifying process;from ledeburite <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation</b> to austenite-graphite one,rather than selfannea 1 ing of castings. (3) Inoculation had more favourrable effect on reducing the chilling tendency than stripping,especilly in case of low Sc castings it was remarkable. By proper controling of both inoculation and stripping,better effect on the microstructure of metal mold cast iron was obtained. (4) The higher the melting temperature,the more the chilling tendency. To obtain a sound structure with metal mold casting,low melting temperature is recommended...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe binary {{phase diagram}} NaBO 2 -H 2 O at ambient pressure, which defines the {{different}} phase equilibria {{that could be}} formed between borates, end-products of NaBH 4 hydrolysis, has been reviewed. Five different solid borates phases have been identified: NaBO 2 · 4 H 2 O (Na[B(OH) 4]· 2 H 2 O), NaBO 2 · 2 H 2 O (Na[B(OH) 4]), NaBO 2 · 2 / 3 H 2 O (Na 3 [B 3 O 4 (OH) 4]), NaBO 2 · 1 / 3 H 2 O (Na 3 [B 3 O 5 (OH) 2]) and NaBO 2 (Na 3 [B 3 O 6]), and their thermal stabilities have been studied. The boundaries of the different Liquid+Solid equilibria for the temperature range from- 10 to 80 °C have been determined, confirming literature data at low temperature (20 °C ~ 50 °C). Moreover the following <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation,</b> Liq. → Ice + NaBO 2 · 4 H 2 O, occurring at- 7 °C, has been determined by DSC. The Liquid-Vapour domain has been studied by ebullioscopy. The invariant transformation Liq. → Vap. + NaBO 2 · 2 / 3 H 2 O has been estimated at 131. 6 °C. This knowledge is paramount {{in the field of}} hydrogen storage through NaBH 4 hydrolysis, in which borate compounds were obtained as hydrolysis reaction products. As a consequence, the authors propose a comparison with previous NaBO 2 -H 2 O binary phase diagrams and its consequence related to hydrogen storage through NaBH 4 hydrolysis...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of the research on the effect of copper on the crystallization process, microstructure and selected properties of the compacted graphite iron. Compacted graphite in cast iron was obtained using Inmold process. The study involved the cast iron containing copper at a concentration up to approximately 4 %. The effect of copper on the temperature of the eutectic crystallization as well as the temperature of start and finish of the austenite transformation was given. It has been shown that copper increases the maximum temperature of the <b>eutectic</b> <b>transformation</b> approximately by 5 °C per 1 % Cu, and the temperature of the this transformation finish approximately by 8 °C per 1 % Cu. This element decreases the temperature of the austenite transformation start approximately by 5 °C per 1 % Cu, and the finish of this transformation approximately by 6 °C per 1 % Cu. It was found that in the microstructure of the compacted graphite iron containing about 3. 8 % Cu, there are still ferrite precipitations near the compacted graphite. The effect of copper on the hardness of cast iron and the pearlite microhardness was given. This stems from the high propensity to direct ferritization of this type of cast iron. It has been shown copper increases the hardness of compacted graphite iron both due to its pearlite forming action as well as because of the increase in the pearlite microhardness (up to approx. 3 % Cu). The conducted studies have shown copper increases the hardness of the compacted graphite iron approximately by 35 HB per 1 % Cu...|$|E
