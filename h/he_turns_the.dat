5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> key in the system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E

25|$|Charles Halloway is the {{character}} who learns {{the most about}} this; he initially views death as unpleasant and it thus becomes a sinister force {{to him that the}} Mirror Maze magnifies. However, Will's words of love help him to see that age does not matter if one focuses instead on the knowledge and affections gained with it, and as his fear vanishes, so does the Mirror Maze.

25|$|Charlie Prince is {{an outlaw}} highwayman and the {{right-hand}} {{man of the}} outlaw Ben Wade (Glenn Ford in 1957 and Russell Crowe in 2007) and his gang. Unlike other characters, Prince appears in both films. Prince is portrayed as a cold-blooded killer who attacks people for merely insulting him. Throughout the film he employs intelligence and wit to overcome his enemies; for example, he makes a deal with Contention's sheriffs with promises to spare them only to kill them after all, and <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> whole city of Contention against its lawmen by promoting a reward of $200 for everyone who can kill even a single of Wade's captors.

2500|$|To {{solve the}} issue of this {{cyclical}} exploitation by the powerful to the powerless, Sarkar calls for {{a new class of}} individuals, called Sadvipra, who possess all the qualities of a warrior, an intellectual, a worker and an acquisitive person who, through spiritual practice will develop the qualities of a compassionate leader, and will work selflessly for the benefit of society. [...] These individuals will have the duty of being {{at the center of this}} evolutionary cycle, overseeing societies trends and preventing the exploitation of society by any class, inspiring the masses during necessary transition to a new age.“Sarkar gets straight to the core of our history with a scheme so simple, unashamedly universal and so evidently inspired more by Indian society and history than by our own. <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> world upside down: whereas India is supposed to be captured, dissected and understood in our paradigms, instead he understands us in his.

2500|$|Peasant Man and Woman Planting Potatoes (F129a) is a spring-planting {{painting}} {{of a man and}} woman working together. [...] <b>He</b> <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> earth with a spade and she plants the potato seed. [...] The figures of both sit below the horizon, symbolic of their connection to the earth. [...] The painting was made in Nuenen, within the North Brabant district where Van Gogh was raised. [...] Two weeks after completing this painting, Van Gogh completed his best known painting, The Potato Eaters. [...] Potatoes were a staple in the diet of the poor peasants, those who could barely afford bread, and meat was a luxury. [...] Potato was a food not fit for those who could afford better in the 19th century. Thomas Carlyle, a Scottish philosopher, deemed the poor “root-eaters”. [...] Van Gogh may have been inspired by the description of Jean-François Millet's biographer, Alfred Sensier of Potato Planting: [...] "one of his [...] most beautiful works" [...] of a married couple [...] "on a wide plain, at the edge of which is a village is lost in the luminous atmosphere; the man opens the ground and the woman drops in the seed potato." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Vienna 2554 {{frontispiece}} {{is famous}} and {{has often been}} reproduced. This frontispiece shows God`s figure bent while {{in the work of}} creation. “There is no close iconographic antecedent for this image.” In this image God is utilizing a huge pair of compasses, which are carefully balanced so as to draw and define. God’s left hand seems to be in the process of putting the disk that is the cosmos into motion. In a broadly read study of Gothic architecture by Otto Von Simpson, this image is titled “The Creator as Architect,” this theme has been important from Plato and onward. Yet the meaning of this frontispiece has been widely debated. [...] Vienna 1179 also has a full page creator image. In this image God is seated on a backless throne and he is holding the orb of the universe in his lap. With his right hand <b>he</b> <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> compasses. In this image he is enclosed within a rectangular frame by a mandorla supported at the corners by four flying angels.
