5|$|Regarding {{the primary}} {{function}} of conscious processing, a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information-processing {{that would otherwise}} be independent. This has been called the integration consensus. Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner. Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher-order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non-human animals (see Neural correlates section above). These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness: differentiation and unity. They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details (differentiation) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems, while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts. However, it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness. Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays, nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness. Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously (e.g., neural activity related to vegetative functions, reflexes, unconscious motor programs, low-level perceptual analyses, etc.) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness, as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect. Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious. For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious <b>integrations,</b> see the article of E. Morsella.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. Regional <b>integration</b> for {{at least}} the last 60 years has focused on trade <b>integration.</b> Balassa's {{canonical}} taxonomy of regional trading arrangements is often interpreted as a sequence from free trade area through customs union and common market to economic union. In the 1980 s the concept of deep <b>integration</b> went beyond trade with its focus on policy harmonization, which came to include monetary <b>integration,</b> but it presupposed trade <b>integration</b> as {{the first step in the}} regional <b>integration</b> sequence. When discussion of monetary <b>integration</b> began in East Asia after 1997, it was in the absence of trade <b>integration.</b> The conventional view would see this as an obstacle to greater regional <b>integration,</b> but some proponents of Asian regionalism saw monetary <b>integration</b> as a step towards promoting trade <b>integration,</b> reversing the orthodox sequence.

40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} designing organizations, especially on the <b>integration</b> of functional units (e. g., manufacturing, R&D, marketing/sales). Cross-functional <b>integration</b> {{is one of the}} focal concepts in Operations Management (OM) and it has been approached both in the context of on-going operations {{as well as in the}} context of new product development. The existing literature on cross-functional <b>integration</b> focuses primarily on assessing the performance effects of <b>integration</b> and often takes the benefits of <b>integration</b> for granted. Some recent literature, however, suggests that there are costs related to <b>integration.</b> Hence, <b>integration</b> can be considered as an investment, inducing significant financial and managerial costs to the organization. Therefore, it is of fundamental importance to assess when <b>integration</b> is needed and the conditions under which it is essential. In order to understand the value of <b>integration,</b> the antecedents and effects of <b>integration</b> are addressed in this research. The {{research focuses on}} cross-functional <b>integration</b> at the manufacturing plant level. A theory-driven empirical research approach is taken. The theoretical basis of this research is in the contingency theory of organizations, especially the work of the early structural contingency theorists. In this research, <b>integration</b> is approached as an information processing phenomenon. Following the arguments of contingency theorists and information processing scholars, the research makes a distinction between three <b>integration</b> constructs: achieved <b>integration,</b> <b>integration</b> mechanisms, and requisite <b>integration.</b> Furthermore, it is suggested that organizations vary in terms of their needs for <b>integration,</b> and emphasis on complex lateral <b>integration</b> mechanisms is needed only when the requirements for <b>integration</b> are significant. The first main finding of this research is that the <b>integration</b> dimension of achieved <b>integration</b> has direct consequences in terms of performance; a high level of achieved <b>integration</b> has a positive effect on comparative manufacturing performance. The effect of cross-functional <b>integration</b> on different dimensions of performance is not similar, however; <b>integration</b> provides more value on some dimensions. The second finding is that plants differ in terms of the requirements for <b>integration,</b> and subsequently in terms of the use of <b>integration</b> mechanisms; when the requirements for <b>integration</b> are substantial, more emphasis is needed on lateral <b>integration</b> mechanisms, including cross-functional job rotation and cross-functional teams. Finally, the results indicate that especially a high emphasis on the development of new technology and product customization increase the need for cross-functional <b>integration</b> at manufacturing plant level. This research contributes to both Operations Management (OM) and Organization Theory (OT), although the main contribution of the research is to OM. To OM literature, this research contributes by (i) providing conceptual clarity to the concept of <b>integration,</b> (ii) conceptualizing and empirically assessing <b>integration</b> as an endogenous variable, and (iii) discussing and assessing the intra-organizational variant of the contingency theory, introduced by Lawrence and Lorsch (1967), in the OM context. Hence, the contribution to OM literature is empirical and theoretical by nature. The contribution to OT literature, on the other hand, is highly empirical by nature. This research contributes to the contingency theory by providing a holistic empirical assessment of the intra-organizational contingency theory argument on <b>integration,</b> including the empirical assessment of the concept of requisite <b>integration.</b> The research results have implications for practice as well. The concept of requisite <b>integration</b> is highly relevant for managers. Because of variations in the requirements for <b>integration,</b> lateral <b>integration</b> mechanisms are not equally important to all organizations; in certain conditions the <b>integration</b> challenge can well be managed with traditional vertical mechanisms like centralization and standardization. The results also imply that managers' need to pay attention to cross-functional <b>integration</b> depends on which performance dimension is strategically important; <b>integration</b> is more valuable on some dimensions of performance than on others...|$|R

They have the advantage that the external forcing is known to be zero, but the disadvantage is that they may not fully reflect reality.
