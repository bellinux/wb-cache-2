We put out the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we put out the original '82 version. I always tell people {{to go back to the}} '82 version.|$|E

Before settlement had been reached, Chris Mallender explained: [...] "We {{have reached a}} view that there are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> outright winners in this.

2500|$|Nolan {{had left}} Fort Concho on July 10, 1877 {{with a force}} of 63 {{officers}} and men for a scout on the Staked Plains. They were looking for Mescalero Apache and Comanche who were out raiding. Nolan's route took him past the Llano's eastern rugged cap rock northwest toward Bull Creek. [...] Nolan was following a route he had followed northwest in 1875. During that scout he had followed an Indian trail into the Llano Estacado region until the trail grew cold and he turned back. He had been threatened with court-martial {{because he was not}} aggressive enough on that scout. Cooler heads prevailed, but Nolan had been deeply shamed by the event. [...] His future patrolling was considered aggressive and the 1877 scout into the area was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> exception.|$|E
2500|$|On November 21, 2008, Rudolph, who {{had been}} {{involved}} in the documentary, gave an exclusive interview to MTV. He explained how development of the project started and who he got involved with it: [...] "I was very involved in putting [...] together, so I saw the process, It was a very interesting process. We made a deal from the very beginning — everybody sort of shook hands with the understanding that there were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> boundaries on this thing. We were going to make an open and honest film and that we weren't going to leave the good stuff on the cutting room floor." [...] Rudolph explained that For the Record is part of the game plan for reintroducing Spears back to her fans as a pop star rather than a tabloid fixture.|$|E

2500|$|Concern {{was raised}} by the fan {{community}} when OpenCritic, a review aggregator site, stated that there were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> review copies of the game prior to the public release and a review embargo that would end on the date of release. The lack of review copies is a general sign within the industry that there are concerns by the developers or publishers that a game may {{not live up to}} expectations and thus indicates that they want to minimise any impact reviews may have prior to release. However, both OpenCritic and Sony later affirmed there would be pre-release review copies and that they were waiting on a pre-release patch before sending these out to journalists. Eurogamer noted that they had expected to have review copies by 5 August, but these were pushed until 8 August so as to get the day-one patch in place, a situation they attributed to the certification process required by Sony for any games on their service. Because of the late arrival of the review copies, {{and the size of the}} game, critics presented their reviews [...] "in progress" [...] over several days, omitting a final review score until they had completed enough of the game to their satisfaction.|$|E
