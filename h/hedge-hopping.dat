50|$|It {{was also}} {{ordered by the}} Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service, as it was {{markedly}} superior to all British fighters available during most of its period of front line service. The RFC in particular still had large numbers of obsolete Airco DH.2s in service nearly a year later when it incurred severe losses during Bloody April. While the majority of aircraft lost were obsolete observation aircraft such as the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2, the Nieuports had begun to lose their decisive advantage and took losses as well. British squadrons that used the type include Nos 1, 29, 32, 40 and 60 of the Royal Flying Corps and No 6 of the Royal Naval Air Service. During the Battle of Arras much use was made of British Nieuports in balloon-busting attacks to prevent enemy artillery spotting. No 40 Squadron experimented with low level <b>hedge-hopping</b> attacks to reach the balloons while Nieuports of No 60 Squadron co-operated with F.E. 2bs of No 11 Squadron to carry out massed strafing attacks on German infantry entrenched {{on both sides of}} the River Scarpe.|$|E
5000|$|On 12 May Briggs {{was proud}} to have Australia's Prime Minister, William Morris Hughes, as his {{passenger}} for the first time. They flew from Buc, Paris, for London with Hughes' private secretary Percy Deane and important dispatches. The weather was beautiful when they took off. About 50 miles from the French coast they ran into low clouds. They flew above them, but about 30 miles further on Briggs realised it was fog, not cloud. Briggs decided to descend through the fog to find an aerodrome where he could phone for a weather report before crossing the Channel. He expected about 200 feet clearance between the fog and the ground, but there was less than fifty feet. Briggs {{had to make a}} tight vertical turn to avoid some poplar trees, which they missed by inches. They landed in a field and two or three soldiers ran towards them. They were clearly Australians and Briggs asked them where exactly they were. [...] "Beside No 11 Australian Hospital, Abbeville" [...] came the reply. Quick as a flash Hughes said [...] "I can see you recognise me, boys. Take me along to your C.O. I have come especially to visit the hospital". While Hughes toured the hospital, Briggs got on the phone and learned that the fog extended right across the Channel and over half of England. This put paid to any ideas of reaching London and Briggs decided to sneak along below the fog to an aerodrome near the coast. He collected Hughes and Deane and after half an hour of <b>hedge-hopping</b> and tree-dodging they landed at Maisoncelle aerodrome.|$|E
40|$|The Rise and the Fall of the Modern Man is an {{excellent}} philosophical essay written by Jacek Dobrowolski. The author – which is contemporary, existential nihilist with pretensions to a minimum of compassion-morality – tracks {{the development of the}} idea of the modern subjectivity, swinging between literature and philosophy. He mastered the rare art of concise updates of momentous philosophical issues, by which he refers in <b>hedge-hopping</b> vivacious style. The review notes the advantages (and shortcomings) of the essay, exposing the main focal points present in its insightful narration developed from disenchanted antiquity to the exhausted post-modernity...|$|E
50|$|Operation <b>Hedge-hop</b> was a {{military}} plan developed during the Korean War. A lack of UN supplies forced American forces to use P-80 high-altitude jets as low altitude strike bombers, beginning in late 1950. The innovation paid off.|$|R
