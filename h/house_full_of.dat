5|$|The North American {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Chris Milk and filmed in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in March 2005. The music video, however, was discarded by the record label, though this version won four Annual MVPA Awards. The video begins with Bedingfield waking up next to a boombox, dressing, brushing her teeth and leaving her home with the boombox. While performing {{on a beach in}} New York City, she kicks her boombox, which comes alive and begins to dance, and she leaves the beach and walks down the street. The video concludes with Bedingfield arriving back home to a <b>house</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> dancing boomboxes in the bedroom.|$|E
5|$|On July 23, 1864, Anderson led 65 men to Renick, Missouri, robbing {{stores and}} tearing down {{telegraph}} wires on the way. They {{had hoped to}} attack a train, but its conductor learned of their presence and turned back before reaching the town. The guerrillas then attacked Allen, Missouri. At least 40 members of the 17th Illinois Cavalry and the Missouri State Militia were in town but took shelter in a fort. The guerrillas were only able to shoot their horses before reinforcements arrived, killing three of Anderson's men. In late July, the Union military sent a force of 100 well-equipped soldiers, and 650 other men, after Anderson. On July 30, Anderson and his men kidnapped the elderly father of the local Union militia's commanding officer. They tortured him until he was near death and sent word to the man's son in an unsuccessful attempt to lure him into an ambush, before releasing the father with instructions to spread word of his mistreatment. On August 1, while searching for militia members, Anderson {{and some of his}} men stopped at a <b>house</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> women and requested food. While they rested at the house, a group of local men attacked. The guerrillas quickly forced the attackers to flee, and Anderson shot and injured one woman as she fled the house. This action angered his men, who saw themselves as the protectors of women, but Anderson dismissed their concerns, stating that such things were inevitable. They chased the men who had attacked them, killing one and mutilating his body. By August 1864, they were regularly scalping the men that they killed.|$|E

In 1907 Hobens married an Irish girl, Delia Agnes Lally (1881–1969), and together {{they would have a}} <b>house</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> children, eight in all.

Together the Earl and Countess of Rosebery added greatly to not only the Mentmore collection but also to that housed at Dalmeny House, Rosebery's Scottish seat, amassing a great library of rare and continental volumes and a collection of artefacts formerly belonging to the Emperor Napoleon I.|$|E
500|$|According to biographer David Buckley, the Los Angeles-based David Bowie, fuelled by an [...] "astronomic" [...] cocaine {{habit and}} {{subsisting}} {{on a diet}} of peppers and milk, spent much of 1975–76 [...] "in a state of psychic terror". Stories—mostly from one interview, pieces of which {{found their way into}} Playboy and Rolling Stone—circulated of the singer living in a <b>house</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> ancient Egyptian artefacts, burning black candles, seeing bodies fall past his window, having his semen stolen by witches, receiving secret messages from The Rolling Stones, and living in morbid fear of fellow Aleister Crowley aficionado Jimmy Page.

500|$|Piccard was {{the mother}} of a <b>house</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> boys. Robert R.

It seems like there was a dozen.... I remember the youngest one took the corn flake box and dumped it on his father's head. Of course, Piccard just brushed it off his head and said, 'No, no.'" [...] "He was very gentle. He loved his boys, and he thought boys would be boys, I guess." [...] The Piccards had three sons of their own, John, Paul, and Donald (who would become a famous balloonist and ballooning innovator in his own right), as well as foster children. The Piccard family archive in the Library of Congress mentions correspondence from foster children whom the Piccards took in, although nothing else seems to be known about them.|$|E

500|$|The house {{remained}} in the Pembroke family until the 4th Earl, Philip Herbert, who was appointed Chancellor of the University of Oxford there in 1641. Herbert preferred to live in Whitehall while his wife Anne (1590–1676) took up residence in Baynard's Castle, describing it in her memoirs as [...] "a <b>house</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> riches, and more secured by my lying there". Pembroke sided with the parliamentarians in the [...] First English Civil War and died in 1650. By {{the time of the}} Restoration, the house was occupied by the Earl of Shrewsbury, [...] who had fought {{on the side of the}} Royalist army in their defeat at Worcester in 1651. Samuel Pepys records that on 19 June 1660 [...] "My Lord went at night with the King to Baynard's Castle to supper... lay long in bed this day, because he came home late from supper with the King". Charles II had only arrived in London on 29 May, and would appoint Pepys' [...] "lord", Edward Montagu as Earl of Sandwich a few weeks later.|$|E
500|$|Several anecdotes {{concerning}} Bogdan-Pitești's {{morals and}} extravagant lifestyle were in circulation from his lifetime. In 1912, Macedonski published an autobiographical Christmas story. It tells how, inspired by Macedonski's desire {{to feed his}} family a traditional turkey feast, Bogdan-Pitești sent him the bird stuffed with 50 gold lei. As T. Vianu writes, such [...] "attitudes of a grand feudal lord" [...] made Bogdan-Pitești into an [...] "indisputably picturesque" [...] person. The account was partly confirmed by Constantin Beldie, who also noted that, during those years, Alexandru Macedonski was [...] "starving" [...] and had to provide for [...] "a <b>house</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> children". Zambaccian however cites a contrasting story once told by actor Ion Iancovescu. It suggests that, during the wartime famine, Macedonski asked Bogdan-Pitești to pay him 1million lei {{for one of the}} few surviving copies of Bronzes; Bogdan-Pitești bluntly offered him 5 lei—Macedonski gave in, commenting that [...] "he is capable of changing his mind, that con artist!" [...] Bogdan-Pitești's mood swings were also discussed by memoirist Radu D. Rosetti. He writes that the boyar scarcely minded when his fortune was being siphoned away by some members of his retinue, but that he publicly humiliated Galaction, and even Domnica, over random expenses.|$|E

But Balaam replied: [...] "Though Balak were to give me his <b>house</b> <b>full</b> <b>of</b> silver and gold, I could not do anything, big or little, contrary to the command of the Lord my God."
