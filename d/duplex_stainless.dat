40|$|Sigma {{phase is}} known to reduce the {{mechanical}} properties and corrosion resistance of <b>duplex</b> and superduplex <b>stainless</b> steels. Therefore, heat treatments and welding must be carefully performed {{so as to avoid}} the appearance of such a detrimental phase, and clearly, models suitable to faithfully predict r-phase precipitation are very useful tools. Most fully analytical models are based on thermodynamic calculations whose agreement with experimental results is not always good, so that such models should be used for qualitative purposes only. Alternatively, it is possible to exploit semiempirical models, where time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams are empirically determined for a given alloy and the continuous-cooling transformation (CCT) diagram is calculated from the TTT diagram. In this work, a semiempirical model for r-phase precipitation in <b>duplex</b> and superduplex <b>stainless</b> steels, under both isothermal and unisothermal conditions, is proposed. Model parameters are calculated from empirical data and CCT diagrams are obtained by means of the additivity rule, whereas experimental measurements for model validation are taken from the literature.

40|$|The hot {{deformation}} behaviour of a <b>duplex</b> ferritic/austenitic <b>stainless</b> steel was studied after different deformation conditions. The results showed {{a strange and}} interesting behaviour in {{the strength of the}} material during post-deformation studies. For most deformation conditions, the flow stress of the material was un-expectedly increased after annealing of deformed structures. This phenomenon implied that microstructural hardening occurred in the material during the interpass annealing rather than the expected softening. Also, an interesting change was observed where the morphology of the austenite phase changed from stringers or layers of austenite to a widmanstätten structure. The microstructural studies suggest that the austenite was dissolved and re-precipitated during the annealing process and the hardening was mostly associated with the change in the morphology of austenite...|$|R
40|$|The {{austenitic}} {{phase of}} four nitrogen containing <b>duplex</b> austenitic-ferritic <b>stainless</b> steels was studied by microhardness measurements and atom probe analysis.

It is argued that the observation of such molecular ions {{is due to the}} presence of Mo-N complexes in the austenite. Few CrN ions were observed, but the existence of Cr-N complexes cannot be ruled out. Comparison with earlier data from the martensitic and ferritic matrices of high speed steels suggest that also in these a complex formation may occur : ions of the type MoC were sometimes observed although to a much lesser extent than MoN in austenite. In the latter case, between 70 and 100 % of the least abundant of Mo and N was observed as MoN...|$|R

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{corrosion}} of austenitic (AISI 304) and <b>duplex</b> (2205) <b>stainless</b> steels in H 2 O/KOH 50 % at 120 °C. The research {{is based on a}} combination of electrochemical, structural and compositional analyses, aimed at assessing the surface modifications resulting from anodic attack and their impact on corrosion resistance. Linear sweep voltammetry and electrochemical impedance spectrometry measurements were carried out in an air-tight high-temperature cell. In-plane and cross-sectional SEM micrography, X-ray diffractometry and EDX profiling were used to characterise samples attacked under electrochemically controlled conditions. Electrochemical results have shown that AISI 304 exhibits a complex passivating behaviour, while the anodic electrokinetics of the duplex is characterised by mixed kinetic control. AISI 304 was found to fail by intergranular corrosion and to be covered: in passive conditions by acicular compounds and in transpassive conditions by a compact layer of corrosion products. Duplex samples, instead, exhibit an uniform form of corrosion morphology and bear a compact layer of corrosion products both in passive and in transpassive conditions.

40|$|A {{transition}} in ferrite morphology occurs {{as a function}} of composition and weld cooling rate BY J. C LIPPOLD AND W. F. SAVAGE ABSTRACT. The distribution and mor-phology of delta ferrite in <b>duplex</b> aus-tenitic <b>stainless</b> steel weldments {{has been shown to be}} a funct ion of both the solidification process as in-fluenced by the composit ion of the alloy and the nature of the solid-state, ferr i te-to-austenite transformation. Four separate regions have been iden-tified relative to a generalized pseudo-binary diagram of the Fe-Cr-Ni ternary system and used to explain the various duplex morphologies observed in the fusion zone. As the solidification mode shifts from one of primary austenite to one of primary ferrite (i. e., as the ratio of ferritizers to austenitizers increases), the location of the retained ferrite shifts from regions at the subgrain boundaries to the subgrain cores. A further increase in the Cr/Ni ratio results in a transition to an acicular austenite-ferrite morphology and f i-nally to a near-equilibrium mixture of Widmanstatten austenite along specif-ic habit planes in the ferrite. In addition to the alloy composit ion, the weld cooling rate was found to be an important factor influencing the ferrite morphology...|$|R
