40|$|To {{probe into}} the pattern {{in which the}} <b>excavation</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> process have on such factors as stress and {{displacement}} in neighboring regions of deep open pits, a mechanical unloading model in coal mining process and another model for the loading process are set up respectively. Besides, FLAC(3 D) software is used to simulate dynamic excavating and loading process in open pits and record such data as the unbalanced stress, unloading strength and displacement fluctuations, which further serve as basis for studying the functional relationship about different mining heights and scope of influence using fitting method. The research {{results indicate that the}} unloading strength enhances with increasing mining depth in a linear fashion. In addition, a noticeable displacement circle takes shape around the stope, which would also extends with growing mining depth. As to waste loading, it brings about large-scale surface subsidence in neighboring regions, which follows a logarithm function convergence pattern with the distance away from the dump border. Under combined effects of <b>excavation</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading,</b> the value of the soil mass displacement would increase with growing mining depth and loading height. Specifically, the soil displacement at a distance of 100 m away from the stope border (around 200 m away from the outer dump border) is abnormally significant and it further develops at a rate of 0. 0228 mm/h...|$|E
40|$|Aerosol {{emissions}} from construction sites {{have a strong}} impact on local air quality. The chemical and physical characteristics of particles and trace gases emitted by earthworks (<b>excavation</b> <b>and</b> <b>loading</b> of soil as well as traffic on unpaved roads) and road works (asphalt sawing, smashing, soil compacting, asphalt paving) have therefore been addressed in this study by using a mobile set-up of numerous modern online aerosol and trace gas instruments including a high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer. Fuel-based emission factors for several variables have been determined, showing that earthwork activities and compacting by use of a plate compactor revealed the highest median emission factors for PM 10 to 54 g l(- 1)). Construction activities were assigned to contribute about 17 % (36 000 t a(- 1)) to total PM 10 emissions and 3 % (13 500 t a(- 1)) to total traffic-related NO emissions in Germany. In particular, calculated PM 10 emissions by earthworks are about 15 800 t a(- 1) corresponding to 44 % of total PM 10 emissions by construction activities in Germany. Mechanical processes such as asphalt sawing (PM 1 /PM 10 = 18 +/- 31 %), soil compacting by a plate compactor (PM 1 /PM 10 = 5 +/- 6 %) and earthworks (PM 1 /PM 10 = 2 +/- 5 %) emit predominantly coarse mineral dust particles. Contrary to that, particle emissions by thermal construction processes (asphalt paving: PM 1 /PM 10 = 62 +/- 14 %) and by the internal combustion engines of heavy machinery (e. g. road roller PM 1 /PM 10 = 94 +/- 9 %) are mostly in the submicron range. These particles were mainly composed of organics containing non-polar saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons (e. g. asphalting: O:C 100 mu g m(- 3) and can easily breach the European limit level of PM 10. This study also shows that particulate mineral dust emissions are strongly dependent on soil moisture and can thus successfully {{be reduced to a}} high percentage by wetting the ground (for PM 10 up to 95 +/- 34 %) showing the importance of potential mitigation strategies.

Fourteen pairs of molars {{were randomly assigned to}} an experimental (incomplete excavation) or to a control group (complete <b>excavation)</b> <b>and</b> <b>loaded</b> vertically (after cyclic <b>loading).</b> Failure <b>load</b> <b>and</b> fracture mode were recorded. Restored teeth in the incomplete excavation group resulted in reduced fracture strength (p < 0. 001) of the tooth-restoration complex (1276 N +/- 626 N) compared with the control group (2768 N +/- 710 N). Teeth in the complete excavation group all fractured vertically, while in the experimental group, cracks in the restoration were observed, characterized as 'ice-cracks'. The fracture strength of teeth restored over incomplete caries excavation was significantly reduced, possibly resulting in long-term clinical failure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{the rock}} mass {{response}} to <b>excavation</b> <b>and</b> thermal <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> improving {{the capability of}} the numerical models for simulating the progressive failure process of brittle rocks are important for safety assessment and optimization design of nuclear waste repositories. The international cooperative DECOVALEX- 2011 project provides a platform for development, validation and comparison of numerical models, in which the Äspö pillar stability experiment (APSE) {{was selected as the}} modeling target for Task B. This paper presents the modeling results of Wuhan University (WHU) team for stages 1 and 2 of Task B by using a coupled thermo-mechanical model within the framework of continuum mechanics. The rock mass response to excavation is modeled with linear elastic, elastoplastic and brittle-plastic models, while the response to heating is modeled with a coupled thermo-elastic model. The capabilities and limitations of the model for representation of the thermo- mechanical responses of the rock pillar are discussed by comparing the modeling results with experimental observations. The results may provide a helpful reference for the stability and safety assessment of the hard granite host rock in China’s Beishan preselected area for high-level radioactive waste disposal...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Characterization of Excavation Damaged Zone (EDZ) {{around an}} {{underground}} excavation {{is a major}} research topic for deep geological disposal of medium to high level radioactive waste. Rock fracturing due to <b>excavation</b> <b>and</b> thermal <b>loading</b> <b>and</b> its resultant rock mass permeability change in the EDZ are important aspects in the EDZ characterisation. A new function to predict rock mass permeability change in fractured rocks has been developed and added into the existing fracture mechanics code FRACOD. The new functions in FRACOD {{has been applied to}} predict the extent of EDZ and permeability change {{in the vicinity of the}} TSX tunnel of URL (Canada), the ZEDEX tunnel of the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (Sweden) and the deposition tunnels in crystalline and sedimentary rocks (Japan). The predicted the EDZ and its permeability are consistent with the measurement data of the TSX tunnel. In the validation test against the ZEDEX tunnel results, a broad agreement between the FRACOD prediction and measurements has been achieved. The results from both tests indicate that FRACOD with the new function is capable of realistically predicting the EDZ and permeability change. Following the validation tests FRACOD is applied to studying the EDZ of conceptual deposition tunnels for radioactive waste in Japan. ...|$|R
40|$|This report {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the in-situ geomechanical testing needs for the Exploratory Shaft (ES) test facility at the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. The testing needs are derived from 10 CFR 60 regulations and simple thermomechanical canister- and room-scale numerical studies. The testing approach suggested is based on an ``iterative`` procedure of full-scale testing combined with numerical and empirical modeling. The testing suggested is based heavily on demonstration of <b>excavation</b> <b>and</b> thermal <b>loading</b> of full-scale repository excavations. Numerical and/or empirical models are compared to the full-scale response, allowing for adjustment of the model and evaluation of confidence in their predictive ability. Additional testing may be specified if confidence in prediction of the rock mass response is low. It is suggested that extensive drifting be conducted within the proposed repository area, including exploration of the bounding Drill Hole Wash and Imbricate fault structures, as well as the Ghost Dance fault. This approach is opposed to an a priori statistical specification of a number of ``point`` tests which attempt to measure a given property at a specific location. 40 refs., 49 figs., 6 tabs...|$|R
40|$|Piping flow {{networks}} {{have often been}} identified in hydrogeological field studies of gravelly soil slopes {{in the southern part}} of China. The present experimental studies have shown that under long-term groundwater seepage, piping flow networks gradually develop in the slope. Factors affecting the development of flow pipe seepage network included the grain size distribution, the degree of soil compaction, and soil depth. Piping seepage networks favorably form if the content of the gravel was high, the soil cohesion was low, the degree of the soil compaction was low, or the soil depth was shallow. Due to the enhanced permeability associated with the presence of flow pipe seepage network in gravelly soil slopes, groundwater can be effectively drained away. This can beneficially prevent the rise of groundwater level in the slope during raining seasons, hence reducing pore water pressure along the potential failure surface and increasing slope stability. Once the flow pipe seepage network was disturbed or damaged, the water level in the upper portion of the slope experienced a great rise, hence reducing the slope stability. Therefore, slope toe <b>excavation</b> <b>and</b> excessive <b>loading</b> at the slope crest should be avoided for slopes with well-developed flow pipe seepage network in order to preserve it. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

The shaft will be excavated by the drill and blast method between 2001 and 2002. It will offer an excellent opportunity for studying the hydromechanical disturbance inside the rock. An in-situ experiment, i. e. a vertical Mine-by-Test, is accordingly scheduled to trace the progress of the hydromechanical disturbance. This involves the excavation of a niche at level – 445 m for drilling boreholes, the instrumentation in the boreholes, and the tracking of the disturbance before, during <b>and</b> after shaft <b>excavation</b> from – 445 m to- 490 m.

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{analysis}} using zero-thickness interface elements of the Goodman type, which incorporate a fracture mechanics-based mixed-mode constitutive law, is presented to study stress-induced cracking and spalling around a highly stressed tunnel. The effect of bolting on stress-fracturing and rock mass deformations (strains of the rock matrix and opening/sliding of the fractures) is considered by applying bolts at various spacing densities. The adopted tunnel <b>excavation</b> <b>and</b> far-field <b>loading</b> sequence approximates conditions typically experienced at the extraction level of a caving operation. Starting from an in situ stress state, the tunnel is excavated <b>and</b> then <b>loaded</b> vertically to simulate the advancement of the overlying undercut. The tunnel is then unloaded to stress values lower than in-situ once the undercut becomes effective and caving begins. Using a Voronoi tessellation routine, the rock mass near the tunnel cross-section is randomly discretized into triangular elements of similar size to that expected for spalled rock blocks. Interface elements are inserted in between all mesh lines. An interface transitioning to the far-field rock mass separates this finely-discretized zone allowing {{the rest of the}} cross-section to be modelled as a linear elastic material for computational efficiency. Rock bolts are simulated in a simplified manner with elasto-plastic rod elements overlapped to the continuum mesh and anchored at several points along their length including the ends. Calculations are run using various bolt spacing densities. The model results show bulking due to stress-fracturing of strong rock. They further show that bulking can only be reduced, but not prevented, through confinement provided by high bolting forces. Postprint (published version...|$|R

40|$|With the {{increasing}} of coal mining depth, the mining conditions are deteriorating, and dynamic hazard {{is becoming more}} likely to happen. This paper analyzes the relations and differences between rockburst in the coal mine and rockburst in the metal mine.

Based on the relationship between RDE value and its corresponding level of rockburst hazard, the rockburst hazard can be divided into five types and evaluation index of each type can be achieved. Then the ongoing rockburst damage level can be classified in one of the five types, and the relative parameters, such as hazard extent, controlling measures also can be achieved. This new quantitative method could not only assess the impacting direction of rockburst occurrence, but also verify the effect of preventive measures for rockburst...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} and predict the in situ brittle rock mass damage process induced by a coupled thermo-mechanical loading, {{the knowledge of}} rock mass yielding strength, scaling relationship between laboratory and in situ and microstructure characterization is required. Difficulties have been recognized due to the seldom availability of in situ experiment and appropriate numerical methodologies. The A"spo Pillar Stability Experiment was used to monitor the evolution of rock mass damage in a pillar of rock separating two 1. 75 -m diameter vertical boreholes. The loading of the pillar was controlled using the in situ stresses, <b>excavation</b> geometry, <b>and</b> locally increasing the rock temperature. The induced loading resulted in a complex discontinuum process that involved fracture initiation, propagation, interaction and buckling, all dominated by a tensile mechanism. Tracking this damage process {{was carried out in}} two steps. Initially, a three-dimensional numerical model was used to generate the stresses from the <b>excavation</b> geometry <b>and</b> thermal <b>loading.</b> The plane strain stresses, at selected locations where detailed displacement monitoring was available, were then used to track the evolution of damage caused by these induced stresses. The grain-based discrete element modeling approach described in Lan et al. (2010), which captures the grain scale heterogeneity of the rock, was used to establish the extent of damage. Good agreement was found between the predicted and measured temperatures and displacements. The grain-based model provided new insights into the progressive failure process...|$|R

This paper discusses a series of experiments that investigate {{the effectiveness of a}} percussive digging device to reduce <b>excavation</b> <b>loads</b> <b>and</b> thereby the mass of the excavator itself. The goal of percussive excavation is to fluidize dry regolith in front of {{the leading edge of the}} tool by mechanically separating the microscopic interlocking grains resulting in a reduced force needed to shear the soil. There are several variables involved with this technique; this experiment varied: Impact energy, frequency, <b>and</b> <b>excavation</b> speed <b>and</b> held constant: impact direction, depth of cut, angle of tool, and soil bulk density. The test apparatus consisted of an aluminum truss bridge with a central pivoting arm. Attached to the arm was a winch with a load cell in line that recorded the tension in the cable <b>and</b> therefore the <b>excavation</b> <b>load.</b> The arm could be adjusted for excavation depth which was recorded along with the arm angle relative to the bridge. A percussive mechanism and 30 " wide pivoting bucket were attached at the end of the arm simulating a basic backhoe with a percussion direction tangent to the direction of. movement. Internally the mechanism used a set of die springs and barrel cam to produce the percussive blow. By changing the springs and the speed of the motor the impact energy and frequency of percussion could be varied independently. Impact energies from 11. 2 J to 30. 5 J and frequencies from 0 BPM to 700 BPM were investigated. A reduction in excavation force of as much as 51 % was achieved in this experimental investigation. Smaller percussive digging implements, tested by others, have achieved a reduction of as much as 72 %. This paper will examine the effects of impact energy, frequency, scaling and their effect on excavation forces in a dry granular material such as lunar regolith. The past several years have shown an increasing interest in mining space resources both for exploration and commercial enterprises.
