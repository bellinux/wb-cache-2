40|$|Numerous {{publications}} {{have been}} issued to mark the 60 th anniversary of {{the outbreak of the}} Warsaw Uprising, offering a variety of viewpoints for this historical event. At the same time, many authors analysed various aspects of the Polish Underground State during the Second World War. Yet, the substantial legal accomplishments of this state, e. g. two Journals of Laws (Dzienniki Ustaw) issued by the State Authorities during the uprising, remain overshadowed. For that reason the following publication has been devoted to the analysis {{of one of the most}} fundamental accomplishments from that period, which is the model of company <b>employee</b> <b>council</b> in the light of the Regulation of the Polish Council of Ministers of 1 August 1944. The authors present the historical context of this regulation and normative constructs introduced in it. They also consider whether it would be possible to use it, at least partially, in the draft copy of the new Polish Labour Code...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rejection of}} <b>employee</b> <b>councils</b> by Poland's trade union Solidarity. In the historical institutional analysis {{in the first part}} of this paper, Solidarity's early commitment to <b>employee</b> <b>councils</b> is traced to the evolution of ideas about economic reform that predominated in the union leadership. The impact of these dominant ideas are examined in the second half of the paper which relates Solidarity's abandonment of <b>employee</b> <b>councils</b> to broadly held beliefs about the limited rights of employee stakeholders. Together, the qualitative and quantitative analysis demonstrates how trade unions' strategies and their ideological underpinnings have shaped Poland's postwar industrial relations institutions.

30|$|With a {{score of}} 95, Japan {{is one of the}} most {{masculine}} societies in the world, while Korea, with {{a score of}} 39 in this dimension, can be considered to be a much less masculine (or more feminine) society. Figure  3 indicates a slightly more balanced approach to the engagement of the organisational units in Korea. A more balanced approach is related to feminine values, which are characterised by ‘working in order to live’, managers strive for consensus, people valuing equality, solidarity and quality in their working lives and where conflicts are resolved by compromise and negotiation (Hofstede 2015). This may explain the higher scores of <b>employee</b> <b>council</b> and strategic planning and thus a higher engagement of organisational units in Korea. Moreover, feminine values also indicate a more supportive approach towards information provided to stakeholders, which explains Korean companies’ higher scores for PR, investor relations and marketing. In contrast, Japan, with a high score in this cultural dimension, may seek more performance outcomes of environmental and social sustainability management, providing only limited information and communication with regard to sustainability management, thus further restricting the engagement of organisational units.|$|E
40|$|It is {{apparent}} from existing research that {{little is known}} about the effectiveness of non-union employee representation (NER) voice arrangements in Australian firms. This article examines both the non-union Suncorp-Metway <b>Employee</b> <b>Council</b> (SMEC) and union voice arrangements at an Australian financial services firm, Suncorp, and assesses their effectiveness in representing the needs of employees. This study is unique because it is one of the few examples of dual representation channels at a single firm. Overall the findings suggest that the effectiveness of union and NER arrangements is dependent on the union and NER voice channels being perceived by the workforce as both representative and able to act effectively or independently. However, while trade unions may provide greater voice than non-union arrangements, the strength of voice is dependent on the legitimacy and effectiveness of trade unions in representing employees' interests at the workplace. The findings also suggest that the marginalisation strategy used by the union in excluding SMEC from its industrial campaigns, coupled with employees' perception of a lack of effective union voice, could impact negatively on the influence that unions may have on management decision-making. This could also be perceived by employees as an inappropriate response by the union to management substitution strategies. As a consequence, any changes to industrial relations policy or trade union strategies regarding NER should be considered in the light of these findings. 19 page(s...|$|E
