40|$|Triggered by the {{deregulation}} of the telecommunications market, {{it is expected that}} the number of services deployed in the telecommunications network will increase dramatically in the near future. It is expected that these services will be interworking. However, as widely reported, <b>interworking</b> <b>services</b> will be subject to the service interaction problem. It is essential to cope with the problem in a developing multi service provider environment as it may substantially delay service deployment and hence form a serious obstacle to rapid service provisioning. In order to cope with the increasing number of services deployed in the network, previous work suggested the application of filtering approaches. This paper suggests such a technique. It is pragmatic in nature and does not require detailed service knowledge. Furthermore, it is shown how the approach can be incorporated into an overall comprehensive service interaction management process. Even though the approach is applied to call control aspects only, it could be extended to cover other areas...|$|E

The Open Architecture for Secure <b>Interworking</b> <b>Services</b> (OASIS), an expressive distributed role-based access control system, is traced {{to the development of the}} Clinical and Biomedical Computing Limited (CBCL) OASIS implementation. Two OASIS deployments are discussed – an Electronic Health Record framework, and an inter-organisational distributed courseware system. The Event-based Distributed Scalable Authorisation Control architecture for the 21 st century (EDSAC 21, or just EDSAC) is then presented along with its four design layers. It builds on OASIS, adding support for the collaborative enforcement of distributed dynamic constraints, and incorporating publish/subscribe messaging to allow scalable and flexible deployment. The OASIS policy language is extended to support delegation, dynamic separation of duties, and obligation policies. An EDSAC prototype is examined. We show that our architecture is ideal for experiments performed into location-aware access control. We then demonstrate how event-based features specific to EDSAC facilitate integration of an ad hoc workflow monitor into an access control system. The EDSAC architecture is powerful, flexible and extensible. It is intended to have widespread applicability as the basis for designing next-generation security middleware and implementing distributed, dynamic privilege management...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} current {{approaches to}} signalling and <b>service</b> <b>interworking</b> between Internet and {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN). It notes that until now convergence {{between the two}} networks has for the most part taken place in the transport and signalling layers. Signalling interworking architectures cater for the specific class of telephony-like services and although they can accommodate the extension of the intelligent network's (IN) realm of control in the Internet, they do not provide a generic platform for <b>service</b> <b>interworking.</b> Through the adoption of the Parlay APIs, a way is foreseen for (a) consolidation of telephone service over both Internet and PSTN through the imposition of a uniform call control API while allowing the installed IN infrastructure to be used also for Internet telephony services and (b) for <b>service</b> <b>interworking</b> between telephony-like <b>services</b> and open distributed services in the Internet.

40|$|We {{describe}} an architecture for secure, indepen-dent, <b>interworking</b> <b>services</b> (Oasis). Each service is made {{responsible for the}} classication of its clients into named roles, using a formal logic to specify precise conditions for entering each role. A client becomes authenticated by presenting credentials to a service that enable the service {{to prove that the}} client conforms to its policy for entry to a particu-lar role. During authentication a data structure is created that embodies the proof. An authenticated client is issued a role member-ship certicate (RMC) for its subsequent use with that service. An RMC is an encryption-protected capability which includes the role name, the iden-tity of the principal to which it was issued and a reference to the issuing service. A proof rule of one service may refer to an authenticated user of an-other; that is, an RMC issued by one service may be required as a credential during authentication by another. A dynamic proof tree may thus be built which exhibits amongst other things the trust rela-tionships between the services which the client has entered. The rst part of the paper shows how a service may dene a set of proof rules (Horn clauses) that specify who may use it and in what way. Dele-gation of rights may be expressed naturally within these rules. The second part of the paper presents the de-sign details of the system. Associated with each RMC issued by a service, the service keeps a cre-dential record (CR). The CR indicates the predi-cates against which the RMC was issued and lists all other services which have issued RMCs to this principal based on this CR. If one of these predicates becomes false, the local RMC is immediately inval-idated. Event technology is used to achieve rapid revocation of the dependent RMCs issued by other services; any portion of a proof tree which is based on this predicate collapses. The system is inherently decentralised and has a tuneable reaction to network or server failure which allows services to make appropriate decisions when authorization or revocation information is unavail-able. A prototype system has been implemented and tested. ...|$|E

40|$|IP Differentiated Services {{is widely}} seen as the {{framework}} to provide Quality of Service (QoS) in the Internet in a scalable fashion.

40|$|Designing and {{operating}} large-scale management systems has become extremely challenging {{due to the}} growing complexity of network technologies and networked service infrastructures. Both knowledge and functionality for performing management tasks are typically shared between service and management realms. However, current management practices do not adequately address this situation, and management functions are added only after services are deployed. In this paper, we introduce co-design patterns to embedded network management and show how they allow for a more structured design of recurring management tasks. Using a distributed fault management scenario we demonstrate how co-design patterns facilitate the <b>interworking</b> of <b>service</b> and management processes that share knowledge and functionality to handle faults collaboratively. We further show that applying co-design patterns results in significant improvement in the runtime performance of embedded management processes...|$|R

40|$|A {{neglected}} {{aspect of}} feature interaction {{is the study}} of appropriate architectures to avoid interactions. This paper considers TINA.

40|$|Abstract. This paper lists various {{limitations}} in 2. 5 G, 3 G cellular networks regarding services, and contrasts {{this to a}} characterization of fourth-generation wireless networks (4 G). In order to investigate 4 G’s feasibility, costeffectiveness, necessary functionality, and its potential with respect to services we created a testbed by adding wireless extensions to a public Gigabit IPnetwork, which was further enhanced with VoIP/SIP to deliver interoperability with existing services and to enable mobile multimedia applications. We present our experiences and analyze the cost-effectiveness of providing (wireless) access to existing voice services in this testbed, how and where these services and end-users can be hosted, and how <b>interworking</b> with <b>services</b> over other networks can be arranged. Furthermore, we present a service architecture to negotiate adaptive mobile multimedia communication, with minimal shared service knowledge, which enables applications to adapt to and make optimal use of the heterogeneous mobile infrastructure. We demonstrate the latter by presenting results from building a mobile-aware media-player, and extend it further {{to take into account}} the user’s context. In conclusion, we show the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of building 4 G networks and provisioning of adaptive mobile multimedia applications by extending the emerging broadband infrastructure with existing wireless LANs. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{convergence}} of telecommunications {{systems and the}} Internet causes a variety of concepts for service integration. The focus of the recent research studies {{and the work of}} several standardization bodies lies mostly on the <b>interworking</b> of <b>services</b> and the universal service access from end-user systems including both fixed and wireless terminals. All approaches are driven by the concept of providing several technologies to users by keeping the peculiarity of each service alive. But, developments should not only concentrate on media adaptation between VoIP and PSTN, but also consider the adaptation among completely different types of applications as for example E- mail, facsimile, or voice. Unified messaging, which is an already accepted service on the market, provides solutions for conversions of different application protocols into each other. The functionality of converting one medium into another is implemented here in so-called media gateways. This paper provides an overview of the current developments in the area of media gateways. Next, it introduces the basic architecture of an existing CORBA-based unified messaging system and the implementation of media gateways for the adaptation of different services. Finally, both approaches are combined to unified messaging-enabled media gateways that improve the user's reachability because of their capability to adapt services to different kinds of end devices...|$|R

This is made possible via the use of Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Presently, there are isolated applications that can assist teleworkers, such as e-mail and video conferencing, which were developed for use over the Internet. But the Internet is a best-effort network with no guarantee of Quality of service (QoS), low security and no standard billing system. The design of this teleworking service involves the integration of many existing services like e-mail, messaging, video conferencing, shared whiteboard and database access. Other requirements are for <b>service</b> providers <b>interworking</b> for <b>service</b> and resource usage, security, and QoS specification. Hence, we explore the emerging open service concept to create this integrated teleworking service {{that can be made}} available for subscription by corporate bodies and individuals. Service federation is the interaction between teleworkers across service provider domains. It is achieved via the <b>interworking</b> of providers’ <b>services,</b> and is an essential aspect of teleworking. We have realised a service federation in a secure and seamless manner in the OSA / Parlay environment via the use of the OSA / Parlay framework. We looked at the use of a framework federation for the actual implementation of service federation. This framework federation is an interworking of frameworks based on an agreed-upon federation contract between them. New framework interfaces were introduced to facilitate this proposed solution, as the OSA / Parlay specifications do not yet support this approach. Service composition is {{the creation of a new}} service instance by composing one or more other services. We implemented this via the use of framework and trader federation. The trader federation was used to locate services or users in different ASP domains. A high level design of the teleworking service was done with federation explored for actual implementation. The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) trading service was used to prove the concept. The RM-ODP methodology is followed in this teleworking service design. The OSA / Parlay terminal capability, generic call control, multiparty and location and Service Capability Features (SCF) were used for implementing in the CORBA Distributed Processing Environment (DPE) ...|$|R
