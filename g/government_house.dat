5|$|From 1777 to 1870, the Governor {{resided in}} Jennings House in Annapolis. Since 1870, the Governor has {{resided in the}} <b>Government</b> <b>House,</b> {{originally}} a Victorian style architecture mansion (later rebuilt / renovated in the 1930s into a Georgian styled mansion to match other colonial / Georgian-Federal era state buildings and residences in the historic city). It is located on State Circle adjacent to the Maryland State House built 1772-1797. In addition to being the residence for the Governor and his family, <b>Government</b> <b>House</b> {{has a number of}} public rooms that are used by the Governor on official occasions.|$|E
5|$|Little {{progress}} {{had been}} made on the memorial by 1926. While some debate occurred in respect to the form that the memorial would take, {{the focus of the}} discussions concerned the location of the memorial, and this centred on the future of <b>Government</b> <b>House</b> {{and the role of the}} Governor. A number of left-wing politicians argued that the grounds of <b>Government</b> <b>House</b> should be turned over to the State and used to build the memorial while the conservatives desired to retain the status quo. By 1925 the National War Memorial committee was prepared to accept the <b>Government</b> <b>House</b> grounds as the site of the memorial, but they delayed making an announcement. This proved to be fortuitous, as legal issues prevented the plan from going ahead. Instead a portion of the grounds, located at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue, was put aside for the purpose. (The plan to move the Governor and to use the grounds as part of a larger war memorial were revisited, over 80 years later, in 2007).|$|E

5|$|The {{committee}} specified {{a budget}} of £25,000 (previously figures of both £5,000 and £100,000 had been discussed), and the conditions of entry stated that the memorial was to be situated {{at the entrance to}} <b>Government</b> <b>House</b> on the corner of King William Street and North Terrace, placing it just behind the existing memorial to the South African War. This location was counter to previous suggestions: a 1919 survey of architects had proposed that the memorial should be built on Montefiore Hill, while in 1923 the plans for the memorial involved erecting it at the rear of <b>Government</b> <b>House,</b> rather than at the front.|$|E

5|$|Before announcing UDI to the nation, Smith, Lardner-Burke and the Deputy Prime Minister Clifford Dupont visited Gibbs at <b>Government</b> <b>House</b> {{to inform}} him {{personally}} {{and ask him}} to resign. Gibbs made clear that he would not do so, but indicated that he would vacate <b>Government</b> <b>House</b> and return to his farm. When Beadle arrived later in the day, he not only persuaded Gibbs to stay at the official residence, but moved in himself to provide advice and moral support. On Beadle's counsel, Gibbs instructed those responsible for law and order in Rhodesia to stay at their posts and carry on as normal. When the Governor showed no sign of stepping down, Smith's government effectively replaced him with Dupont, appointing the latter to the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution attached to UDI. Lardner-Burke asked Beadle to administer the oath of allegiance to Dupont, but was rebuffed; Beadle said he would be committing a criminal offence if he did so.|$|E

5|$|Although a Liberal {{by family}} {{heritage}} and disposition, Primrose never sought public office, or ever actively participated in politics. On September 10, 1936, {{on the advice}} of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King, Primrose was appointed to the office of Lieutenant Governor of Alberta by Governor General John Buchan, succeeding William L. Walsh, his old friend. He was sworn in on October 1, 1936. During his time as Lieutenant-Governor, Primrose and his wife resided in <b>Government</b> <b>House,</b> however, during this time, he was plagued by illness, therefore making him essentially unable to fulfill his duties of office, remaining in medical care from October 19, 1937 until his death. Most of his duties were carried out by his wife, Lily, who hosted the 1937 New Year's Day reception at <b>Government</b> <b>House,</b> and served as an honorary officer of the Royal Alexandra Hospital Women's Auxiliary. Public functions were also attended by others family members, assisting in the absence of Primrose. On February 25, 1937, the Speech from the Throne was read by Horace Harvey, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Alberta, due to Primrose's illness.|$|E
