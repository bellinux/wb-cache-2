Although the Queensland economy experienced problems from the mid-1880s, the downturn only became apparent from 1889 after local confidence waned and British investment funds dried up. The building industry was affected first and most severely, then depression spread to other sectors of the economy. The severest years of the depression in Queensland were from 1891 to 1893. Brisbane's economic experiences followed those of the Queensland economy overall but with different emphases. The phenomenal growth of the 1880s had culminated in widespread speculation in land and buildings, which created an excess capacity of offices and dwellings. Brisbane's descent into depression began with a crash in the construction and building materials industries {{and the collapse of}} building societies towards the end of 1891 after the climax of its land and building boom. Land and rent values began dropping in 1890, reaching their lowest level in 1893-1894. <b>Empty</b> <b>dwellings</b> became a common sight in the city and suburbs - some deserted while other recently built ones had never been occupied.

40|$|This paper explores a {{specific}} theme {{within the context}} of the use of 'headline' indicators by the UK strategy on sustainable development. It argues that the indicator on housing (unfit dwellings) might appropriately be replaced by a measure relating to void (<b>empty)</b> <b>dwellings.</b> Following an interpretation of what constitutes a 'headline' indicator, the paper explores the role of such an indicator in assessing the sustainability of the housing system in terms of the respective roles played by both unfit and void dwellings. The argument is then expanded through an examination of current issues and initiatives in relation to void dwellings, including abandonment in the core areas of some cities and falling demand in the social housing sector generally. The implications for the environment of poor management of the housing stock are stressed, as are the linkages between man-made and natural systems. Failure to address the issues raised could result in a 'lose-lose' situation with unsustainable outcomes for both urban and rural environments. The void dwelling measure is superior to that of unfits on a range of counts, but particularly if this wider context is taken into consideration.

40|$|To {{walk through}} Islington, Camden and Hackney {{in the early}} 1970 s was to walk along street after street of soot-blackened, late Georgian and Victorian {{terraces}} and villas, boarded up and left semi-derelict. In 1971 Greater London contained 23, 100 <b>empty</b> <b>dwellings</b> awaiting demolition; 29 % of this housing stock was built before 1875 and 67 % between 1875 and 1919. By {{the middle of the}} decade, thousands of these houses had been reclaimed and repaired by squatters, a movement which re-emerged in the late 1960 s and which, by 1976,was estimated at between 20 - 30, 000 people throughout Greater London. This historic spatial configuration of the city allowed the social and political movements of the 1970 s to flourish, as groups of like-minded people began to live and work in close proximity. For women, it enabled radical experiments in collective living and shared childcare and for some feminists, active in the women’s liberation movement, it provided the framework for an extensive network of women-only housing, together with social and political spaces. This paper examines the origins of a community of women who moved in and squatted the streets surrounding Broadway Market and London Fields in Hackney during the 1970 s. Through oral testimony, it uncovers the historical importance of this community to wider feminist politics in London, and the significance for women of taking control over their immediate built environment...|$|E
40|$|The {{large amount}} of {{incoming}} refugees in the Netherlands is obliging national and local governments to be quick and creative in finding solutions to housing shortages, especially {{in the category of}} social housing. Alternative housing solutions are being applied, {{such as the use of}} <b>empty</b> <b>dwellings</b> and shared housing. One of those alternative solutions appeared in the municipality of Nijmegen. An old student residence in the village Lent has been transformed in a four-year residence for ninety-six Eritrean male permit holders. Remarkable is that the dwellings are actually not situated within the village, but on a remote and isolated location outside of it. The question is how these Eritrean permit holders can integrate in Dutch society when mostly people from their own country of origin surround them? Many scholars argue that permit holders who live in a residential segregated area are likely to integrate at a slower pace than those who live in a regular neighbourhood a neighbourhood in a city or village where one is surrounded by people of varied ethnic backgrounds. To verify this hypothesis, I have done qualitative research on the following central research question: what is the influence of housing and the neighbourhood on the social integration of Eritrean permit holders living in the municipality of Nijmegen? I have compared two different groups Eritrean permit holders living in the ethnic segregated neighbourhood in Lent and those who live in a multi-ethnic neighbourhood in or nearby Nijmegen. I have examined several factors involved in social integration processes, including the housing area, housing composition, population composition, home-making, ethnic and interethnic contact, social capital, social trust, and social cohesion. It has appeared that the opposite of what scholars argue reveals to be true. Those in the segregated neighbourhood seem to have access to more social capital and more resources, which is crucial to be able to integrate on a social level...|$|E

Outdoor air quality can have a large impact on indoor air quality. An {{experimental}} study has been conducted into a dwelling, in collaboration between the LHVP and the CSTB, in order to study the indoor concentration of pollutants depending on the outdoor pollution and the air renewal due to ventilation system. Different experiments have been conducted in an <b>empty</b> <b>dwelling</b> situated in a polluted area in Paris during winter and summer periods. The measured pollutants were indoor and outdoor CO, SO 2, NO, NO 2, O 3, VOC, PM 2. 5 particles and black smoke index. Additional measurements have been performed as meteorological conditions (wind speed and direction, external and internal temperature and humidity). The pollutants sampling time steps were comprised between two minutes and one hour depending on pollutant. The transfer of the pollutants has been tested as regards different ventilation strategies. Air renewal of the dwelling was thus controlled : the dwelling has been air tight and the residual air leakage has been characterised using blower door and tracer gas technique. A mechanical ventilation system has been installed in the dwelling in order to have two controlled extract flows. During the summer experiments, measurements have also been carried out with opened windows. This paper presents the impact of ventilation parameters on outdoor pollutants transfer. The results of the study are the part of the outdoor pollution entering in the dwelling, versus the ventilation air renewal. On the basis of these experiments, we have also developed a methodology to assess the air renewal.

40|$|Reinhabitating {{means to}} stimulate a new {{attitude}} towards the use of dwellings and towards the necessity and nature of refurbishing, thinking about a new or different use or just about extending {{the life cycle of}} that commonly considered old. Reflecting on the use of our houses from this point of view, turns out to be especially suitable in the actual economical time of crisis, and notably in a country dealing with an oversized housing development. A newspaper’s new allows us to enlighten this situation. In 2004, more houses were built in Spain than altogether in Germany, France and Italy. In other words, a country with a population of 44 million inhabitants built more houses than three countries whose population comes altogether to 204 million inhabitants, almost five times the amount of Spain inhabitants. Under these circumstances and considering the high amount of <b>empty</b> <b>dwellings,</b> secondary residences, as well as unoccupied industrial and services facilities in good conditions, a research about new housing seems to be, nevertheless, a perfectly deferrable matter. More than a century ago it was published “The Practicon. Complete treatise on cooking and reusing the leftovers”. In that text Angel Muro, the author, defended a cuisine based on using the leftovers of meals and managing to cook with them delicious courses. We think that the house, its conception, its equipment and its form, remain buried by an avalanche of premises which always try to find an ideal house, as an impossible research. Perhaps studying the way of reinhabitating pre-existing houses, does not finally turn out to be just a naïve effort, but the most honest way to approach the actual housing situation while enabling an open-ended process of improvement. During 2009 and 2010 Habitar, a research group of the Catalan Polytechnic University, worked on this concept applied to the city of Madrid thanks to an I+D Research project granted by the Spanish Government, which concluded with the diffusion of the results by means of six exhibitions and nine small books. To take advantage of the leftovers of the Spanish opulence edge is the main aim of the present research, that pretend to assign a new use to preexistences. We do not refer to refurbishing or to interventions which pursue the renewal of a building, but to the proposal of modification of the use of the building itself. Reinhabitating does not mean restoring. Reinhabitating is reusing architecture, but just modifying the way of using it. It has not to do with plastic interventions, but with the how itself. In this article we will explain our experience with the popularization of these concepts which were applied to the house, to the street and to the city. Postprint (published version...|$|E

The first residential buildings in Długa Street were made of wood, according to the wattle and daub technique. Brick houses appeared no earlier than 15th century.
