40|$|The {{combustion}} of 0. 32 -cm-diameter {{pure iron}} rods in gaseous oxygen under normal and reduced gravity conditions {{has been investigated}} {{to determine whether the}} upward Regression Rate of the Melting Interface (RRMI) and other burning characteristics are affected by the type of igniter material (wire) used. The experiments performed involved igniting the samples in normal gravity with different types of <b>igniter</b> <b>wire</b> at the two separate test pressures of 0. 69 and 6. 9 MPa (100 and 1000 psia). The igniter wires used were pure aluminum wire, pure iron wire and aluminum-palladium (Pyrofuze®) wire. The results have shown that in normal gravity the RRMI is unaffected by the type of <b>igniter</b> <b>wire</b> used when measured after the first two drops of molten oxide products have detached from the burning sample. However, the ignition event and subsequent first stages of burning of the iron rods were significantly different for the different igniter wires. Post-test microanalysis of test samples showed that in normal gravity, no igniter material was present with the formed oxide products {{on the end of the}} test sample rod. However, post-test microanalysis of test samples burned in reduced gravity showed a film of palladium, introduced by the Pyrofuze® <b>igniter</b> <b>wire,</b> coating the interface between the melted and resolidified portion of the rod and the formed oxide products. The physical orientation and location of the palladium film and the fact that palladium acts as a catalyst in many oxidation reactions suggests that reduced gravity burning could be influenced by the choice of <b>igniter</b> <b>wire</b> and further experimentation is warranted. Additionally, the palladium present during the ignition event in normal gravity tests may act as a catalyst to further promote the ignition of the sample and influence the initial stages of burning...|$|E
40|$|Characterization of the {{combustion}} products released during {{the burning of}} commonly used engineering metallic materials may aid in material selection and risk assessment {{for the design of}} oxygen systems. The characterization of combustion products in regards to size distribution and morphology gives useful information for systems addressing fire detection. Aluminum rods (3. 2 -mm diameter cylinders) were vertically mounted inside a combustion chamber and ignited in pressurized oxygen by resistively heating an aluminum/palladium <b>igniter</b> <b>wire</b> attached {{to the bottom of the}} test sample. This paper describes the experimental work conducted to establish the particle size distribution and morphology of the resultant combustion products collected after the burning was completed and subsequently analyzed. In general, {{the combustion}} products consisted of a re-solidified oxidized slag and many small hollow spheres of size ranging from about 500 nm to 1000 µm in diameter, surfaced with quenched dendritic and grain-like structures. The combustion products were characterized using optical and scanning electron microscopy...|$|E

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{behavior and}} interaction effects of multiple metal particles are {{addressed in this}} project. The microgravity environment presents {{a unique opportunity to}} create an "aerosol" consisting of relatively large, 50 - 300 micron diameter particles, so that both cloud flame structure and individual particle combustion behavior can be characterized simultaneously. The microgravity experiments are conducted using the 2. 2 s NASA Lewis Research Center drop tower. Each test includes aerosolizing metal particles under microgravity, a delay required to produce a steady aerosol, and igniting such an "aerosol" at constant pressure using a hot <b>wire</b> <b>igniter.</b> The flame structure and details of individual particle combustion are visualized using both high speed movie and regular speed video cameras. Combustion products are collected and analyzed after the experiment. A detailed description of the experimental apparatus is given elsewhere. Microgravity experiments with magnesium particle aerosols have been conducted and experiments with zirconium particles are currently in progress. A numerical, time dependent model of the flame propagation in magnesium aerosol is being developed...|$|R
40|$|Physical {{characteristics}} of the combustion of metal particle groups have been addressed in this research. The combustion behavior and interaction effects of multiple metal particles has been studied using a microgravity environment, which presents {{a unique opportunity to}} create an "aerosol" consisting of relatively large particles, i. e., 50 - 300 m diameter. Combustion behavior of such an aerosol could be examined using methods adopted from well-developed single particle combustion research. The experiment included fluidizing relatively large (order of 100 m diameter) uniform metal particles under microgravity and igniting such an "aerosol" using a hot <b>wire</b> <b>igniter.</b> The flame propagation and details of individual particle combustion and particle interaction have been studied using a high speed movie and video-imaging with cameras coupled with microscope lenses to resolve individual particles. Interference filters were used to separate characteristic metal and metal oxide radiation bands from the thermal black body radiation. Recorded flame images were digitized and various image processing techniques including flame position tracking, color separation, and pixel by pixel image comparison were employed to understand the processes occurring in the burning aerosol. The development of individual particle flames, merging or separation, and extinguishment as well as induced particle motion have been analyzed to identify the mechanisms governing these processes. Size distribution, morphology, and elemental compositions of combustion products were characterized and used to link the observed in this project aerosol combustion phenomena with the recently expanded mechanism of single metal particle combustion...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to understand the mechanisms by which particle interactions affect ignition and combustion in the two-phase systems. Combustion of metal aerosols representing the two-phase systems is carried out in the microgravity environment enabling one to avoid the buoyant flows that mask the particle motion due to the particle-particle interaction effects. In addition, relatively large, e. g., 100 micron diameter particles can be used, that remain aerosolized (i. e., do not fall down as they would at normal gravity) so that their behavior ahead, behind, and within the propagating flame can be resolved optically. An experimental apparatus exploiting this approach has been designed for the 2. 2 -s drop tower microgravity experiments. A typical experiment includes fluidizing metal particles under microgravity in an acoustic field, turning off the acoustic exciter, and igniting the created aerosol at a constant pressure using a hot <b>wire</b> <b>igniter.</b> The flame propagation and details of the individual particle combustion and particle interactions are studied using high-speed movie and video cameras coupled with microscope lenses to resolve individual particles. Recorded flame images are digitized and various image processing techniques including flame position tracking, color separation, and pixel by pixel image comparisons are employed to understand the processes occurring in the burning aerosols. Condensed combustion products are collected after each experiment for the phase, composition, and morphology analyses. New experiments described in this paper address combustion of Ti and Al particle clouds in air and combustion of Mg particle clouds in CO 2. In addition, microgravity combustion experiments have been conducted with the particles of the newly produced Al-Mg mechanical alloys aerosolized in air...|$|R
40|$|The Material Ignition and Suppression Test (MIST) {{project has}} had the {{objective}} of evaluating the ease of ignition and the fire suppression of materials used in spacecraft under environmental condition expected in a spacecraft. For this purpose, an experimental and theoretical research program is being conducted {{on the effect of}} space exploration atmospheres (SEA) on the piloted ignition of representative combustible materials, and on their fire suppression characteristics. The experimental apparatus and test methodology is derived from the Forced Ignition and Flame Spread Test (FIST), a well-developed bench scale test designed to extract material properties relevant to prediction of material flammability. In the FIST test, materials are exposed to an external radiant flux and the ignition delay and critical mass flux at ignition are determined {{as a function of the}} type of material and environmental conditions. In the original MIST design, a small-scale cylindrical flow duct with fuel samples attached to its inside wall was heated by a cylindrical heater located at the central axis of the cylinder. However, as the project evolved it was decided by NASA that it would be better to produce an experimental design that could accommodate other experiments with different experimental concepts. Based on those instructions and input from the requirements of other researchers that may share the hardware in an ISS/CIR experiment, a cylindrical design based on placing the sample at the center of an optically transparent tube with heaters equally spaced along the exterior of the cylinder was developed. Piloted ignition is attained by a hot <b>wire</b> <b>igniter</b> downstream of the fuel sample. Environment variables that can be studied via this experimental apparatus include: external radiant flux, oxidizer oxygen concentration, flow velocity, ambient pressure, and gravity level (if flown in the ISS/CIR). This constitutes the current experimental design, which maintains fairly good consistency with Dr Tien's and Dr Olson's project approaches. A further goal of the project has been to develop a combined solid/gas phase numerical model based on the MIST test methodology to predict the flammability behavior of practical materials in spacecraft...|$|R
