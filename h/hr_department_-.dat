40|$|Previous {{research}} {{tends to}} overemphasize frictions, cultural clashes and communication breakdowns in virtual teams. The author aims at exploring {{positive aspects of}} cross-cultural collaboration and identifying some of the conditions underlying trust-building, employee motivation and team effectiveness. Whereas much research on virtual teams has taken its point of departure in Western MNCs and primarily addressed headquarter concerns, this case study of a Danish MNC´s Indian R & D site gives voice to Indian managers and employees and explores through semi-structured interviews and observations how they perceive communication and collaboration within multinational and multicultural R & D teams, and how they try to find common ground. Based on the interviews accounts, there are several enablers of virtual team collaboration: advanced information and communication technology facilitated virtual communication, and high English-language proficiency among the engineers at different R & D sites made dialogue and knowledge exchange feasible. Moreover, team members shared a strong professional identity as engineers and technicians, and they displayed a strong identification with the MNC, a world leader in the wind power industry. Perceived national differences in leadership and communication style played a minor role, maybe {{because the majority of}} Indian managers and employees had previous experience working in other Western MNCs. Some of the Indian managers and employees were even able to act as boundary-spanners between headquarters and the Indian R&D site due to their study and work experiences in other business environments. Culture courses that introduced the Danish and Indian team members to a North European communication and management style, and to an Indian respectively, were introduced on the initiative of the Danish managing director, who - in contrast to the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> <b>-</b> recognized the importance of facilitating the virtual teamwork through cultural awareness training.

40|$|Purpose - This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} organizational redesign opportunities currently offered by web-based technological innovations contribute to rebuilding and strengthening the employee-HR department relationship, rendering personnel management policy criteria more transparent, increasing perceived fairness and thus helping to instil {{trust in the}} <b>HR</b> <b>department,</b> albeit in a diverse virtual context. Design/methodology/approach - We designed a survey involving 526 Gen Y employees and tested our hypotheses using structural equation modelling analyses. Findings - The results {{confirm a positive relationship}} between relational e-HRM system adoption, procedural justice and trust in the <b>HR</b> <b>department.</b> Research limitations/implications <b>-</b> The results provide evidence that technology can support the development of institutional trust in virtual environments and thus contribute to the growing e-HRM literature, to the more consolidated Strategic HRM research domain and to the debate on trust in technology-mediated relationships. Practical implications - The paper provides valuable and at times unexpected results on the new potential role of the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> in the current fluid and insecure labour market, thereby forming the basis for defining some useful guidelines to design and implement the e-HRM architecture. Originality/value - The paper focuses on understanding how relational e-HRM could impact on the direct employee-HR department relationship, from the Gen Y employees perspective, that is almost neglected in the growing literature.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the role of human {{resources}} (HR) in organisational change at higher education institutions (HEIs) and the perceptions of those within the organisation towards the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> and their capability in leading a change initiative. Design/methodology/approach - The objectives were achieved through a case study in which an <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> at a British university was undergoing a cultural change initiative, implemented by the <b>HR</b> <b>department.</b> Primary research was collected by analysing documents underlying the change project. Also 12 semi-structured interviews of 30 - 40 minutes were carried out; interviewees were chosen based on the need to have a cross-section including members of the change team and the pilot <b>departments.</b> Findings <b>-</b> The <b>HR</b> <b>departments</b> at HEI may be faced with difficulties when attempting to implement change due to the relatively "new" nature of the function, meaning that they must first justify their position, worth and capability before attempting to gain the buy-in of academic departments to implement a culture change in their <b>departments.</b> Research limitations/implications <b>-</b> More research could be carried out into a cross-section of British universities with HR-led change initiatives to broaden the data collection. Limitations in this research include the relatively small number of interviewees. A greater cross-section of interviewees would have been beneficial. Originality/value - The originality of this paper is in the relatively un-discussed nature of the role of the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> in change initiatives at HEI and how this could be improved, therefore this could be beneficial for <b>HR</b> <b>departments</b> in this sector...|$|R

40|$|Studies of the {{evolution}} of human resource management (HRM) within Western contexts of industrial changes and economic developments have revealed particular nuances and idiosyncrasies in the transformation of the <b>HR</b> <b>department's</b> roles and status. However, little research has been done to systematically examine the current state of HRM in developing economies. Simultaneously, little {{has been written about the}} determinants and contribution of <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> effectiveness in developing settings. The current thesis bridged these research gaps through the four related studies. Study 1 utilised an institutional lens to conduct a content analysis approach to examine the development of HRM in Vietnam. Leximancer technique was used to analyse a collection of 100 published journal articles on HRM in Vietnam from 1983 to 2013. The contribution of Study 1 is a systematic and semantic understanding of HRM development in Vietnam which has not been examined previously. The findings showed that the development of HRM in Vietnam has been associated with key stages of economic development. Study 1 also showed the integration of personnel management, HRM, and SHRM in Vietnam. Findings in Study 1 played a fundamental role in examining antecedents and consequences of the <b>HR</b> <b>department's</b> effectiveness in response to the scarcity of research on this topic in Western and Vietnamese literature. Study 2 was based on the existing literature pertaining to power and influence of the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> and institutional theory in human resources. Study 2 examined the impact of formal authority on the perceptions of <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> effectiveness. Study 2 obtained a sample of 405 line managers' responses and a separate sample of 155 line managers to test and validate the proposed model. Structural equation modelling (SEM) and multiple linear regressions were utilised to analyse the data. Multiple group analysis in SEM was also undertaken. Study 2 contributed empirical evidence to the literature by showing that formal authority is an important condition for the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> to be recognised as effective in Vietnam's public sector organisations. Thus, the public sector <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> needs to consider political and influencing skills to increase its impact. By contrast, Study 2 also found that the absence of the <b>HR</b> <b>department's</b> formal authority in Vietnam's private sector organisations highlights its ability to develop a partnership with line managers and transfer HRM activities to these counterparts. Study 3 extended the perspective of power and influence of the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> to examine the effect of an organisation's HR orientations on the implementation of HRM. Two separate samples of 405 and 192 line managers were used to test and confirm the research findings. SEM and partial least squares were employed in the analysis. Study 3 added to the perspective of a strong HRM system by providing empirical evidence of the consistency of an organisation's HR emphasis with strategic HRM orientation and implemented HR practices. This consistency affected line managers' perceptions of <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> effectiveness. Multiple group analysis affirmed that ownership types have significant influences on HRM implementation and <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> effectiveness. Study 4 investigated the impact of an organisation's strategic orientations on the roles and status of the <b>HR</b> <b>department.</b> SEM was used to test the hypothesised model with a sample of 484 line managers. Study 4 highlighted the importance of strategic orientations in influencing line managers' perceptions of <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> effectiveness. Importantly, when the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> does not perform effectively its HR roles, strategic orientations are a means for the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> to enhance its effectiveness. Study 4 also found that line managers hold positive perceptions of the strategic contribution of the <b>HR</b> <b>department.</b> This is opposite to findings of prior studies, and so this study makes a significant contribution to Vietnamese literature on HRM...|$|R

40|$|The human {{resource}} department in many organisations is at a crossroad of relevance, constantly being {{faced with the}} challenge to prove that it can add value towards the objectives of the business. The Human Resource (<b>HR)</b> <b>department</b> is also faced with a reality that, if the department does not add value to the organisation, it will be farmed out to independent contractors, who can deliver the HR functions at a more efficient and cost effective way. However, organisations have a great opportunity to achieve excellence and competitive advantage through the utilisation of the organisation‟s {{human resource}}s. Many scholars and authors argued that organisations can achieve the most out of its human resources if the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> is a Strategic Business Partner (SBP) in these organisations. A thorough literature review has led to the discovery that, despite the appraisal of the Strategic Business Partners (SBP) approach to the management of human resources, little progress has been made with the reinvention of the <b>HR</b> <b>departments</b> from support function towards being a SBP (Lawler & Morhman, 2003; Keith, 2007). The slow progress in the transformation of the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> was attributed {{to a wide range of}} factors including the lack of competencies to take up Strategic Business Partnership roles, lack of management support, and incongruent organisational cultures (Keith, 2007; Sanders & Frenkel, 2009; Ulrich & Brockbank, 2005). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with HR professionals, Managing Directors and other Directors, who sit on a strategic table, to identify the challenges and opportunities the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> faced as a SBP in organisations. A self-administered questionnaire, based on an existing questionnaire (Ulrich & Cornell (1997) HR role assessment survey) was used to gather the perception of employees regarding the roles the <b>HR</b> <b>departments</b> play in organisations. In this study organisational culture was identified as having a huge impact towards the implementation of <b>HR</b> <b>departments</b> as SBPs. The study also identified the competencies needed for the effective execution of SBP roles, the challenges <b>HR</b> <b>departments</b> may face in the process as well as the important roles the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> should be devoting most of its time and resources to...|$|R

30|$|Considering the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> and its (strategic) role in {{identifying}} the HR gap, the study also demonstrated that HR strategy formation referred to the more general level of managing accounting change interventions. At first glance, cross-case analysis illustrated that <b>HR</b> <b>departments</b> had already started to re-launch their role as ‘personnel administration’, in particular claiming their ‘new’ position as HR service provider (see Table  6 in Appendix, first column). For instance, professionalism was indicated by centralized sub-units responsible for core HR systems, e.g., staffing, dual education and vocational trainings, or implementation of common HR programs, and also claimed by the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> heads with reference to their individual professional education. A ‘delegation’-effect was also obvious because accounting change was not assigned to be a strategic domain of the <b>HR</b> <b>departments.</b> All research sites put the department of finance, in particular the CFO, in charge of change interventions. Hence, {{the role of the}} <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> was pre-configured by the implementation strategy and, possibly, executed by an HR task force. Thus, the antecedent responsibility for HRD seemed to be mixed and messy as to its gradual evolvement, and strategizing on HR matters appeared as a more vague and ambiguous area of activity.|$|R

With these analyses we examine whether the HR roles and strong HRM system characteristics are equally important to different stakeholders. Results show that the perceived effectiveness of the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> in its operational roles is decisive in trade union representatives’ effectiveness assessment. For line managers, process oriented roles are crucial. Next, if the <b>HR</b> <b>department</b> scores high on strong HRM system characteristics, it is perceived as more effective in its HR roles.

The major finding is that {{while there are no}} significant differences between HR and line executives’ perceptions of the importance of each functional area in HRM, there are significant differences between line and HR executives’ perceptions of the effectiveness of these areas. Line and HR executives both view the issue of securing, developing, and maintaining human resources as a critical issue for the execution of daily operations and long-term strategic plans. However, line executives perceive HR performance effectiveness to be significantly lower than HR executives do in these functional areas. Therefore <b>HR</b> <b>departments</b> are not meeting the performance expectations of line executives. There are three possible reasons for the poor performance of <b>HR</b> <b>departments.</b> First, government intervention may limit HR departments’ ability to act strategically.
