5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} epitope {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide <b>is</b> <b>small</b> (<b>about</b> six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
25|$|A {{press release}} announces that the orbiter has {{detected}} methane in the Martian atmosphere. Although the amount <b>is</b> <b>small,</b> <b>about</b> 10 parts {{in a thousand}} million, it has excited scientists to question its source. Since methane {{is removed from the}} Martian atmosphere very rapidly, there must be a current source that replenishes it. Because one of the possible sources could be microbial life, it is planned to verify the reliability of these data and especially watch for difference in the concentration in various places on Mars. It is hoped that the source of this gas can be discovered by finding its location of release.|$|E
2500|$|S. scabiei mites {{are under}} 0.5mm in size, but are {{sometimes}} visible as pinpoints of white. [...] Gravid females tunnel into the dead, outermost layer (stratum corneum) of a host's skin and deposit {{eggs in the}} shallow burrows. The eggs hatch into larvae in three to ten days. These young mites move about on the skin and molt into a [...] "nymphal" [...] stage, before maturing as adults, which live {{three to four weeks}} in the host's skin. Males roam on top of the skin, occasionally burrowing into the skin. In general, the total number of adult mites infesting a healthy hygienic person with noncrusted scabies <b>is</b> <b>small,</b> <b>about</b> 11 females in burrows, on average.|$|E
