Gordon had driven well at the circuit, but without finishing. His team brought the car he drove to victory in the season's 18th race at Chicagoland Speedway. Gordon felt it would help him at intermediate tracks and get him back into championship contention. Although he had a poor start in the chase, Kahne rectified this by finishing second at Talladega Superspeedway. He believed the momentum would be carried into Charlotte and stated he would push hard to win races.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} drum protocol, a drum may {{be thought}} of as a person or being and is to be regarded and respected as such. Drum etiquette is highly important. There are regional variations. The drum is the central symbol of Oklahoma pow wows and is located in the center of the dance floor and pow wow (which are themselves shaped in concentric circles). Southern drums are suspended by four posts, one for each direction. Northern drums are set up on the outside of the dance area, with the host drum <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position.</b> Drummer-singers are expected to remain at their drum and ready to sing at any moment's notice; a dancer might approach the drum and whistle, fan or gesture his staff over a drum to indicate his request for a song even if it is not that drum group's turn to sing. In some regions it is considered disrespectful to leave a drum completely unattended. Some drum groups do not allow females to sit down at their drum but welcome them to stand behind the drummers and sing backup harmonies; the reasons for this point vaguely to a variety of tribal stories that attempt to tell the history of drumming as each group understands it. People bring water to the drummers and generally assist the players as needed. (It is also considered a taboo among some nations to discuss spiritual teachings in writing or to name absolute authority in reference to spiritual teachings.) The drum is offered gifts of tobacco during giveaways and musicians acknowledge this by standing.|$|E

500|$|Ferguson's {{target of}} {{achieving}} an unassailable {{lead in the}} Premiership was coming into fruition. United managed to gain 22 points {{out of a possible}} 33 over the winter, in spite of the absence of first team regulars. Such a massive gap between themselves and the chasing pack with ten games remaining was enough for Manchester bookmaker Fred Done to pay out on punters who backed the champions in retaining their crown. Within several hours, £17,000 had been snapped up, irrespective if a late challenger had emerged. Drawing away to AS Monaco gave them a slender but crucial outcome but a shock defeat at the hands of Sheffield Wednesday prevented them from opening up a 14-point advantage. The league leaders' dismal run continued; Paul Scholes scored his first goal in over four months to salvage a point at Upton Park. On the same night, Arsenal sealed a 1–0 win against Wimbledon to close the gap on United and set up a frantic contest between the top two on the Saturday. A late surge from the Gunners also reopened betting for the Premiership title race, much to the delight of Arsène Wenger. Leading up to the potential championship decider, Ferguson was adamant that a win would just about seal this title. After numerous attempts to break the deadlock in the match, Arsenal finally managed to score with 15 minutes left; Marc Overmars latched onto an Anelka header coming from a long ball and used his agility to flick it beyond the goalkeeper to give Arsenal the all important lead and win. Peter Schmeichel, who was in agony in the closing stages was ruled out for the Monaco encounter on Wednesday with a hamstring injury. When asked which team was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>position</b> going into the finishing straight of the season, Wenger admitted to the press that United had a [...] "small advantage" [...] over the rest.
