500|$|The {{countries}} {{surrounding the}} gulf (Egypt, Israel, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia) operate their own seismic networks {{and during the}} months that followed the main event, fourteen temporary and permanent stations recorded thousands of aftershocks. Klinger acquired data on approximately 1,000 aftershocks via the <b>European-Mediterranean</b> <b>Seismological</b> Center and the agencies of each country. The data was filtered to include only those aftershocks within [...] of the epicenter. Data from four stations from the Institute for Petroleum Research and Geophysics of Israel plus seven stations from Jordan's Natural Resource Authority recorded aftershocks in the epicentral area that met the restriction. It was found that the aftershocks were arranged with a north-south alignment over a length of [...] and that was expected from an earthquake of such magnitude.

50|$|The {{magnitude}} 5.1 (Mw) main shock occurred inland on 11 May 2011 at 18:47 {{local time}} (16:47 UTC) about 2.5 km northeast of Lorca, Spain, at an extremely shallow focal depth of 1 km (0.6 mi). Much {{of the southern}} Iberian Peninsula - in particular the Murcia Region - is located on a tectonic zone of common seismic activity, where a plate boundary separating the Eurasia and African Plates is formed. However, most tremors in the region do not exceed perceptible magnitudes. The earthquake {{was estimated to be}} a direct result of strike-slip faulting near the major Alhama de Murcia fault, along an unusually shallow fault of between 40 and 50 km (25 to 31 mi) long. Local specialists also reported the presence of surface rupturing {{in the vicinity of the}} fault. Initial estimates from the United States Geological Survey placed the magnitude of the quake at 5.3 (Mw); the <b>European-Mediterranean</b> <b>Seismological</b> <b>Centre</b> reported an intensity of magnitude 5.2 (ML).|$|E
40|$|Macroseismic {{investigation}} {{with data}} collected through web- based questionnaires is today routinely applied by most impor- tant seismological institutions, {{such as the}} U. S. Geological Survey ([URL] last accessed December 2014), British Geological Survey ([URL] earthquakes. bgs. ac. uk/questionnaire/EqQuestIntro. html; last accessed December 2014), <b>European-Mediterranean</b> <b>Seismological</b> <b>Centre</b> ([URL] choose_earthquake. php?lang=en; last accessed December 2014), Schweizerische Erdbebendienst ([URL] ch/eq/detected/eq_form/index_EN; last accessed December 2014), Bureau Central Sismologique Français ([URL]. seisme. prd. fr/english. php; last accessed December 2014), and the New Zealand GeoNet project ([URL] quakes/; last accessed December 2014). The wide diffusion of Internet and the citizen collaboration (crowdsourcing) allow documentation of information on seismic effects and production of a macroseismic field with low costs and almost in real time. Transformation from qualitative information (as given by ques- tionnaires) to numerical quantification is a crucial issue. In the traditional evaluation of intensity, experts used to work through a complex comparison of effects basically driven by personal expe- rience. The major problem with this approach concerns the dif- ficulty in verifing and reproducing the evaluation process {{due to the lack}} of a detailed explanation of the employed workflow and to the large variability of possible cases. On the other hand, an automatic method for the estimation of macroseismic intensities needs to be completely well defined and specified in order to be reproducible and verifiable. For these reasons, this paper presents a comprehensive explanation of our intensity assessment method. A useful automatic method for intensity assessment should be computationally fast and strictly follow the macroseismic scales. To meet these requirements in 2010, we proposed a method that firstly quantified the effects using additive scores associated with each answer of the questionnaire item and then determined an intensity estimate for each questionnaire (Sbarra et al., 2010). After a trial period and having collected more than 500, 000 questionnaires, we were able to thoroughly test the method. As a result of this testing, we describe here a new improved method that takes into account further factors, such as the situation and the location of the observer (Sbarra et al., 2012, 2014), to obtain a more accurate estimate of the macroseismic intensity degree at the municipality level. In this paper, we show some applications of our method with reference to the Mercalli–Cancani–Sieberg (MCS) scale, because this scale has long been used with Italian earthquakes and allows easy comparison between these intensities and other traditional ones...|$|E

In this study, only routine teleseismic P travel-time data are used, as provided by worldwide stations reporting to the International <b>Seismological</b> <b>Centre</b> (ISC).

50|$|The 1954 {{earthquake}} measured 6.7 on {{the moment}} magnitude scale {{according to the}} International <b>Seismological</b> <b>Centre</b> and had a depth of 15 km. There is evidence of crustal shortening along a NW-SE trend near the epicenter, but the structure of any faults is poorly understood. Because Algeria has a thin shelf and a steep coastal slope, submarine landslides are quite common, especially during earthquakes. During the 1954 earthquake, five underwater telephone cables in the Mediterranean Sea were cut by an avalanche, three recording the exact time of impact.|$|R
5|$|The Euro-Mediterranean <b>Seismological</b> <b>Centre</b> (EMSC) website, {{one of the}} top global {{earthquake}} information website {{experienced a}} massive and immediate traffic surge caused by the convergence of eyewitnesses looking for information about the shaking.

The epicenter was determined with 30km by retropagating 2 min of EMSC website traffic without using any seismic data. The authors argue that eyewitnesses can be considered as real time sensor, their website visit being triggerred by the ground shaking.|$|R
