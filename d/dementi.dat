The color is not good, but all the rest excellent; and one of these so much-lauded pictures is {{the portrait of a}} washer-woman. [...] "Pope Pius," [...] at the Louvre, is as bad in color as remarkable for its vigor and look of life. The man had a genius for painting portraits and common life, but must attempt the heroic;--failed signally; and what is worse, carried a whole nation blundering after him. Had you told a Frenchman so, twenty years ago, he would have thrown the <b>démenti</b> in your teeth; or, at least, laughed at you in scornful incredulity. They say of us that we don't know when we are beaten: they go a step further, and swear their defeats are victories. David {{was a part of the}} glory of the empire; and one might as well have said then that [...] "Romulus" [...] was a bad picture, as that Toulouse was a lost battle. Old-fashioned people, who believe in the Emperor, believe in the Théâtre Français, and believe that Ducis improved upon Shakspeare, have the above opinion. Still, it is curious to remark, in this place, how art and literature become party matters, and political sects have their favorite painters and authors.|$|E

40|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD) is {{the most}} common form of {{dementia}} among elderly people, it is a progressive and degenerative disease of the brain, which causes thinking and memory to become seriously impaired. Several tools and techniques are used by researchers in order to detect the disease. but the most common one is the electroencephalogram EEG because it's very easy and cheap to produce. EEGs of patients with AD exhibit some abnormalities characterized by a less complex activity due to neuronal losses. The entropy of a data set mesure the amount of information contained in the sequence. In other words it gives a measure of the complexity of the sequence. This project evaluates the entropy and higher orders entropies of the EEGs of healthy and Alzheimer disease patients. The results showed that it is possible to distinguish with a 100 % accuracy on certain electrodes healthy from AD patients.

PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is evident in approximately one-quarter of patients {{at the time of}} PD diagnosis, and half of PD patients have progressed to PD dementia (PDD) after 10 years. The transition to PDD from PD-MCI is not linear and may depend on the facets of cognition affected. Despite increased understanding of pathological, neurotransmitter and genetic drivers, there are no proven pharmacological treatments for PD-MCI and those licensed for PDD are of modest benefit only. Biomarkers to predict those most at risk of developing PDD are under investigation and are likely to be essential so that early and individualized treatment can be provided.

40|$|Non-invasive {{mapping of}} brain {{functional}} connectivity (FC) {{has played a}} fundamental role in neuroscience, and numerous scientists have been fascinated by its ability to reveal the brain's intricate morphology and functional properties. In recent years, two different techniques have been developed that are able to explore FC in pathophysiological conditions and to provide simple and non-invasive biomarkers for the detection of disease onset, severity and progression. These techniques are independent component analysis, which allows a network-based functional exploration of the brain, and graph theory, which provides a quantitative characterization of the whole-brain FC. In this paper we provide an overview of these two techniques and some examples of their clinical applications in the most common neurodegenerative disorders associated with cognitive decline, including mild cognitive impairment, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy Bodies and behavioral variant frontotemporal <b>dementi...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: mild {{cognitive}} impairment (MCI) is proposed to describe the transitional stage between normal cognitive aging and dementia.

These interviews explored the advantages and difficulties of using MCI as a clinical diagnosis. Results: there is wide variation in the clinical use of MCI. This variation depends on institutional factors and two types of cultural factors: (a) clinical culture, and (b) the “evidential culture” – how research and guidelines figure in clinical practice.

Age-related dysfunction {{of the central}} auditory system (central presbycusis) is common but rarely looked for by those who provide aural rehabilitation. Patients who complain of difficulty hearing in noise—the key symptom of central presbycusis—are generally disadvantaged with conventional rehabilitation. This symptom should be documented with commercially available speech-in-noise tests, which use materials that are uncompli-cated to administer. Those patients who perform poorly on such tests should have a customized rehabilitation program aimed at optimizing their remaining communication abilities. Otolaryngologists who provide auditory rehabilitation may wish to consider expanding their practices to meet the communica-tion needs of older patients with central presbycusis.

Lexical features {{have been shown}} to be effective for classification, but the automatic transcription of spontaneous speech demands expensive language modeling. Therefore, this paper proposes a classifier that does not require language modeling and that uses sub-lexical features instead of lexical features. This classifier operates on sequences of phonemes obtained by a phoneme recognizer and exhaustively analyzes the saliency of all possible sub-sequences using a support vector machine with a string kernel. An empirical study of a dialogue corpus containing elderly speech showed that the sub-lexical classifier was robust against the poor modeling of language and it performed better than a lexical classifier that used hidden Markov models of words.

FCSRT-IR is a measure of memory under conditions that control attention and cognitive processing in order to obtain an assessment of memory unconfounded by normal age-related changes in cognition. FCSRT-IR performance has been associated with preclini-cal and early dementia in several longitudinal epidemiological studies. Factor and item response theory analyses were applied to FCSRT-IR data from patients at a geriatric primary care center who had inde-pendently established clinical diagnoses. The results provide supporting evidence for the psychometric adequacy of the FCSR-IR in terms of reliability, essential (sufficient) unidimensionality, information across the continuum of memory disability/ability, and classification accuracy.
