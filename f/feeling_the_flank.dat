500|$|On 26 August, Horii {{moved the}} first of his {{disembarking}} troops forward, a body of some 3,500 soldiers, against the 39th Infantry Battalion, some 400-strong. Around midday, the attack began in earnest, with Australian positions around Isurava being subjected to a heavy artillery bombardment. [...] The Japanese tactics were to pin the Australians in place with frontal attacks while <b>feeling</b> for <b>the</b> <b>flanks,</b> with a view to cutting them off with forces from the rear. Lieutenant Colonel Hatsuo Tsukamoto's 1/144th was given the task of leading the assault, even though they had been in combat almost continuously since the initial Japanese landing in mid-July. Meanwhile, Major Tadashi Horie's 2/144th was allocated to the eastern side of Eora Creek where Japanese reconnaissance had revealed the [...] parallel track bypassing Isurava. The battalion was tasked with seizing Missima and Abuari and threatening the Australian rear around Alola. The 3/144th, under Lieutenant Colonel Genichiro Kuwada, was to conduct a <b>flanking</b> move to <b>the</b> west against the Australian left.|$|R
50|$|In medicine, {{the fluid}} wave test or fluid thrill test {{is a test}} for ascites (free fluid in the {{abdominal}} cavity). It is performed by having the patient (or a colleague) push their hands down on the midline of the abdomen. The examiner then taps one <b>flank,</b> while <b>feeling</b> on <b>the</b> other <b>flank</b> for <b>the</b> tap. The pressure on the midline prevents vibrations through the abdominal wall while the fluid allows the tap to be felt on the other side.The result is considered positive if tap can be felt on the other side. However, even with the midline pressure, transmission through the skin must be excluded.A positive fluid wave test indicates {{that there is a}} free fluid (ascites) in the abdomen. When one side of the abdomen is pressed, the other side may also be painful due to the transfer of the fluid in it.|$|R

The present study is an attempt to determine what influence the extracellular matrix has on the initial outgrowth of the limb bud. Stage- 12 to- 18 chick embryo lateral plates were examined in relation to proline and sulfate incorporation into collagen and proteo-glycan. <b>The</b> <b>flank</b> and limbs incorporated the same amount of labeled proline and sulfate before stage 16. At stage 16 <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> began to incorporate more of both isotopes until at stage 18 there was twice as much incorporation into <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> as into <b>the</b> limbs. <b>The</b> <b>flank</b> and limbs contained the same type of collagen during the period examined. The limbs contained both large and small proteoglycans but <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> contained only small proteoglycans. These data suggest that the extracellular matrix in <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> and limb regions {{may play a role in}} limb outgrowth and that the limb buds at these stages may be more inclined toward cartilage development...|$|R

40|$|The {{life and}} the {{performance}} of an insert in metal cutting are mainly dependent on the heat that is generated in the contact zone on the tool rake and on <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> face with <b>the</b> transient and machined surfaces.

It has been seen that there is no significant difference of tool temperature noticed while machining different CGI materials having hardness from (140 - 236 HBW).

40|$|The {{current study}} {{assessed}} {{the performance of}} a patient with right neglect (M. A. H.) across various manipulations of <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> paradigm. When required to identify a central target {{in the presence of a}} unilateral flanker, M. A. H. responded to <b>the</b> <b>flanking</b> distractor on <b>the</b> left (ipsilesional) side as if it were the target, even when <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> appeared at left peripheral locations. A right (contralesional) flanker did not affect central identification performance (Experiment 1). The "ipsilesional capture" effect persisted when pretrial location markers were introduced to make <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> and target locations more clearly defined (Experiment 2). However, when <b>the</b> ipsilesional <b>flanker</b> appeared simultaneously with a contralesional flanker, central target detection improved to ceiling (Experiment 3). Interestingly, with these three-stimulus displays, congruency effects in reaction time only occurred in relation to <b>the</b> <b>flanker</b> on <b>the</b> contralesional side (Experiment 3), suggesting impaired response selectivity to ipsilesional stimuli. Congruency effects were produced on both sides only when <b>the</b> two <b>flanking</b> distractors grouped together (by both onset and offset, Experiment 4) and when <b>the</b> ipsilesional <b>flanking</b> distractor grouped with the target by onset (lone contra offset, Experiment 4). The results are attributed to ipsilesional capture in central target detection, which is offset by temporal grouping processes when another stimulus appears on the contralateral side...|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn {{electrophysiological}} and anatomical study {{identified the}} sensory inputs to the "flank" of the mouse's superior colliculus, a large, ventrolateral extension of layer IV (stratum griseum intermediate) {{that has no}} overlying visual layers (II and III). Electrophysiological recordings with subsequent histological localization showed that <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> receives predominantly somatosensory projections from the perioral region but not visual input. In its caudal parts, <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> also has limb and trunk somatosensory inputs and auditory inputs. The perioral somatosensory projections to <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> are ordered somatotopically. <b>The</b> <b>flank</b> is {{considered part of the}} superior colliculus since the perioral inputs are adjacent to inputs from mystacial vibrissae in the more medial parts of the superior colliculus, hence forming a single continuous map. The finding that no visual responses occur above <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> (due to <b>the</b> absence of superficial layers) or within it is in accord with the concept of an intermodality "spatial register". Since flank neurons have somatosensory receptive fields in non-visible parts of the body and they lack visual responses, <b>the</b> <b>flank</b> may be involved more in tactile-dependent rather than in vision-dependent orienting behaviors. Thus, the superior colliculus may, in parallel, carry out sensorimotor transformations related to (1) shift of gaze and (2) tactile-dependent behaviors not involving vision...|$|R
