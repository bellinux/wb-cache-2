40|$|This paper {{considers}} the joint optimal design of CEOs' on-the-job <b>compensation</b> and <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> {{in a general}} optimal contracting framework. We obtain a novel argument for high-powered, non-linear CEO compensation such as bonus schemes and option grants {{that is different from}} existing arguments based on moral hazard and risk taking. Based on this argument, the CEO's optimal on-the-job compensation scheme is designed to minimize the use of costly <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> to reduce CEO entrenchment, thus minimizing the CEO's informational rents. Our model generates novel empirical predictions concerning the interrelation of CEOs' on-the-job <b>compensation</b> and <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> as well as CEO turnover which, {{to the extent that they}} have been tested, are consistent with the empirical evidence.

40|$|This study {{concludes with}} {{a fair amount of}} {{certainty}} that there is a relationship between child maltreatment and economic decline. Stated differently, there is substantial evidence that economic decline affects the treatment of children by their parents. However, {{it is important to note}} that the data presented on the link between economic decline and child maltreatment in this synthesis is outdated, and thus limited. That is, most of the studies presented as supporting evidence for the relationship between child abuse and economic decline date from the Great Depression to the 1990 's. No recent evidence (i. e., within the last 10 years) was found to lend support for the relationship between child maltreatment and economic decline. At best, one can conclude that a number of economic and social changes occurring since the Depression (e. g., unemployment <b>compensation,</b> <b>severance</b> <b>pay,</b> employment of spouse, unemployment precipitated by job loss) probably lessen the negative impact of job and income loss in the early 90 's context. And, although the magnitude of effects may differ, the direction of effects and the mechanisms by which economic loss affects children are similar for these two periods. Unfortunately, no comparable data was found to extend this conclusion to more recent years. Second, with respect to the link between TANF and child maltreatment, it can be concluded that higher welfare benefits are associated with lower rates of neglect and out-of-home care. It is critical to note that the welfare reforms discussed in this synthesis have taken place against the backdrop of a very strong economy! Therefore, welfare reforms may have larger long-run effects on maltreatment than the evidence presented here...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{new evidence}} from two large household surveys on the compliance of firms with <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> regulations in Indonesia, {{and the extent}} to which changes in <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> regulations could affect employment rigidity. Compliance appears to be low, as only one-third of workers entitled to <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> report receiving it, and on average workers only collect 40 percent of the payment due to them. Eligible female and low-wage workers are least likely to report receiving payments. Widespread non-compliance is consistent with trends in employment rigidity, which remained essentially unchanged following the large increases in severance mandated by the 2003 law. These results suggest that workers may benefit from a compromise that relaxes <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> regulations while improving enforcement of <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> statutes, and possibly establishing a system of unemployment benefits.

The findings are threefold: (i) one-third of total obligations incurred by firms failed to be honored and {{only a small portion}} of defaulted <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> claims was reimbursed by the Guarantee Fund; (ii) while both men and women seem to be equally affected, workers older than 40 were disproportion ally represented among those whose <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> claims failed to be honored; and (iii) among firms that incurred <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> liabilities, larger and more productive firms were more likely to observe their fiduciary obligations and pay them out.

To do so, we use a search and matching model with risk averse workers, in which we assume that workers may be unionized and that bargaining is over wages and <b>severance</b> <b>pay.</b> Bargaining results in levels of <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> providing full insurance, which depend on the generosity of unemployment benefits and on the job finding rate.

UI and <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> are closely related programs as they both cushion the loss of earnings associated with job loss while covering more or less identical groups of workers.

30|$|<b>Severance</b> <b>pay</b> {{is often}} {{considered}} one of the least appropriate options of income support for the unemployed, because it offers inadequate income protection and imposes large efficiency costs. On the income protection front, <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> suffers from three main weaknesses. First, the system suffers from the so-called nonperformance problem (the fact that despite legal entitlement, many workers fail to obtain benefits). 3 Second, <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> benefits are inefficient, as the same amount is paid regardless of the duration of the unemployment spell. And third, <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> reduces the access of vulnerable groups, including youth, to jobs (Blanchard 2000). On the efficiency front, there is ample evidence that <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> reduces labor market flows and thus acts as a source of “labor market sclerosis.” It therefore reduces productivity via hindering technological change (see Autor et al. 2007 for the study on the US and Bassanini et al. 2009 for OECD countries), as well as, particularly {{in the context of the}} overall stringent employment protection legislation, reduces employment levels (see Holzmann and Vodopivec 2012 for a recent review of theoretical and empirical findings).|$|R

The model provides some guidelines for Labour Law reforms. In the European case, a decrease in the <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> for unfair dismissals fixed by law will decrease the <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> offered by the firm, and only under some assumptions will decrease the expected firing cost and will increase the settlement probability. In addition, the transition from the European to the American case is likely to increase the probability of settlement (and to decrease it in the opposite case) with ambiguous effects on agreed <b>severance</b> <b>pay</b> and expected firing costs. dismissal, individual dismissal, <b>severance</b> <b>pay,</b> firing costs, Labour Law...|$|R
