40|$|The {{effect of}} Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae culture {{supernatant}} on swine pulmonary alveolar macrophage (PAM) functions was studied. The A. pleuropneumoniae culture supernatant was toxic to PAMs when tested by MTT (3 -(4, 5 -dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl) - 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays. Biological {{activity of the}} supernatant was ascribed to cytotoxins. Both the LDH and MTT assays were used for measurement of crude A. pleuropneumoniae cytotoxin concentration with good reproducibility. A preparation containing 6, 800 toxic units/mL (determined by MTT assay) was used for subsequent experiments. The objective was to study the effect of crude cytotoxin {{on the ability of}} swine PAMs to kill Pasteurella multocida. Phagocytosis of opsonized P. multocida type A by PAMs was not efficient. Only 8 % of incubated organisms were ingested by noncytotoxin-treated PAMs after 30 min phagocytosis. The bactericidal effect of noncytotoxin-treated PAMs only last for 60 min, after which, the rate of growth of surviving P. multocida exceeded the rate of bacterial killing by PAMs. Complete elimination of P. multocida by PAMs was not observed in this study. A total loss of ability to kill P. multocida by PAMs was seen when <b>the</b> <b>PAMs</b> were pretreated with a high concentration (340 toxic units/mL) of A. pleuropneumoniae cytotoxin. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>PAMs</b> were pretreated with a low concentration (3. 4 toxic units/mL) of cytotoxin, a significant reduction in the killing of P. multocida was still observed.

40|$|Compensation of {{interferometer}} phase fluctuations due {{mainly to}} the atmospheruc water vapor {{is one of the}} most important subjects for future millimeter- and submillimeter-wave radio synthesis arrays and future millimeter-wave very long baseline arrays because the fluctuations are the most serious limiting factor for their spatial resolutions and sensitivities. In the present thesis, a method for the atmospheric phase cornpensatxon called 2 ̆ 7 Paired Antennas Method (PAM) 2 ̆ 7 is examined in detail. <b>The</b> <b>PAM</b> uses pairs of closely located antennas in order to simultaneously observe a target radio source and an adjacent reference calibrator with nearly parallel baselines and correct the interferometer phase of the target source using that of the reference source. The effectiveness of <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> was studied by means of interferometer phase compensation experiments using the Nobeyama Millimeter Array and the Nobeyarna Radio Seeing Monitor at Nobeyuma Radio Observatory of National Astrononucal Observatory, Japan. In the experiments, a celestial radio source 3 C 279 and a geostationary satellite (Japanese Communication Satellite called 2 ̆ 7 CS 2 ̆ 7) were simultaneously observed and the angular-separation dependence of the effectiveness of the phase compensation was investigated. It was always clearly seen in the experiments that the phase compensation with <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> was very successful when the separation angle was smaller than a few degrees, even in the case that the millimeter-wave interferometer phase of the target source was compensated using the centimeter-wave phase of the reference source. The degree of phase compensation aheady achieved the level of less than 0. 1 mm rms in excess path length, which is the goal of the planned new arrays for the future submillimeter-wave radio interferometry, when the atmospheric condition at Nobeyama was good enough. This demonstrates that the high resolution and high quality radio images are readily obtainable in the future large submillimeter-wave arrays at least <b>if</b> one uses <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> or similar method of equivalent performance in order to eliminate the atmospheric phase fluctuations. A model of the atmospheric structure was constructed to account for the experimental results on the basis of the Kolmogorov turbulence, frozen flow, and phase screen. A statistical calculation of the residual rms phase of the corrected phase in <b>the</b> <b>PAM,</b> based on <b>the</b> above atmospheric structure model, led to the numerical results in excellent agreement with a number of features of the experimental results. This implies that the underlying model, though simple, is a fairly good approximation of the reality. The computer simulations for the phase compensation in terms of <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> at <b>the</b> potential sites of the future submillimeter-wave arrays revealed impressive results promising that the necessary level of the phase compensation for the future arrays is achieved, provided that suitable reference sources are available within a few degrees around a target source. The antenna-switching method is also a promising phase compensation technique similar to <b>the</b> <b>PAM.</b> Although <b>the</b> switching observation itself was not carried out in the phase compensation experiments with the Nobeyama Millimeter Array and Nobeyama Radio Seeing Monitor, I studied this method using the demonstrated data series produced from the PAM-experimental data and investigated the separation-angle dependence. Using the statistical model developed in the present thesis, the feasibility of the antenna-switching method was compared with that of <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> and investigated in terms of the specific parameters such as the switching cycle time or the ON source time to a target source within one switching cycle. The computer simulations based on the model showed the potential of the antenna-switching method, which is equally effective in the phase compensation ability as <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> <b>if</b> radio telescope antennas are able to slew fast enough. It was thus confirmed that the fast antenna-switching method is an effective way to realize the precise phase compensation with the simpler system than <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> 2 ̆ 7 s.

40|$|Background: <b>The</b> <b>PAM</b> {{has been}} {{proven to be a}} {{reliable}} and valid instrument to measure patient activation in the US and other countries and is used as a first step towards fully informed and involved patients. Given these promising results, <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> has recently been introduced in the Netherlands. In other countries the focus has been on measuring patient activation in patient groups in which self-management is an important factor, such as diabetic patients. It is interesting to know whether activation levels of diabetic patients are comparable across countries. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> score is related to the quality of care. So far, this hypothesis has not yet been tested. Methods: Over 8500 diabetes patients were asked to fill out <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> and <b>the</b> CQI Diabetes. CQI Diabetes is a validated questionnaire on patient experiences with diabetic care. Results: Data are available in May.

A mathematical model on the axial deformation and bending stiffness of elongation type of PAM was built applying theoretical analysis and experimental research methods. The results show that the axial deformation of <b>PAM</b> and <b>the</b> air pressure supplying to <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> are nonlinearly related due to the generic nonlinear of deformation of the rubber tube; the bending angle of <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> is proportional to moment; Similarly, the bending angle of <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> is also proportional to its length.

Correlation coefficients and agreement in absolute energy expenditure (EE) levels between PAM, Actigraph and Cosmed were calculated. The test-retest reliability was examined among 296 PAM's using a laboratory shaker. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV) were determined. Correlations for treadmill walking and stair walking, respectively, were r 2 = 0. 95 and r 2 = 0. 65 for PAM with Actigraph, r 2 = 0. 82 and r 2 = 0. 93 for PAM with VO 2 and r 2 = 0. 64 and 0. 74 for Actigraph with VO 2. Both <b>the</b> <b>PAM</b> and Actigraph underestimated EE during treadmill and stair walking by a substantial amount.

40|$|We have {{previously}} shown {{that differences in}} life span among members of Swiss mouse populations appear {{to be related to}} their exploration of a T-maze, with a slow exploration ('slow mice') being linked to alteration of spontaneous behavior and monoaminergic systems, impaired immune function and shorter life span. In general these traits resemble some of the characteristics of chronologically old animals. Thus, we proposed the 'slow mice' as a model of prematurely aging mice (PAM). Now, we have compared female PAM with non-prematurely aging mice (NPAM) as regards a number of behavioral, endocrine and immunological parameters which were studied under both basal and stress conditions.
