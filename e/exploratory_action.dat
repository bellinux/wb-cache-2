40|$|Deep {{reinforcement}} learning has great stride in solving challenging motion control tasks. Recently {{there has been}} a significant amount of work on methods to exploit the data gathered during training, but less work is done on good methods for generating data to learn from. For continuous actions domains, the typical method for generating <b>exploratory</b> <b>actions</b> is by sampling from a Gaussian distribution centred around the mean of a policy. Although these methods can find an optimal policy, in practise, they do not scale well, and solving environments with many actions dimensions becomes impractical. We consider learning a forward dynamics model to predict the result, ($s_{t+ 1 }$), of taking a particular action, ($a$), given a specific observation of the state, ($s_{t}$). With a model such as this we, can perform what comes more naturally to biological systems that have already collect experience, we perform internal predictions of outcomes and endeavour to try actions we believe have a reasonable chance of success. This method greatly reduces the space of <b>exploratory</b> <b>actions,</b> increasing learning speed and enables higher quality solutions to difficult problems, such as robotic locomotion.

40|$|Abstract—Coordinating the joint-actions {{of agents}} in coop-erative multiagent systems is a {{difficult}} problem in many real world domains. Learning in such multiagent systems can be slow because an agent may not only {{need to learn how}} to behave in a complex environment, but also to account for the actions of other learning agents. The inability of an agent to distinguish between the true environmental dynamics and those caused by the stochastic exploratory actions of other agents creates noise in each agent’s reward signal. This learning noise can have unforeseen and often undesirable effects on the resultant system performance. We define such noise as <b>exploratory</b> <b>action</b> noise, demonstrate the critical impact it can have on the learning process in multiagent settings, and introduce a reward structure to effectively remove such noise from each agent’s reward signal. In particular, we introduce two types of Coordinated Learning without <b>Exploratory</b> <b>Action</b> Noise (CLEAN) rewards that allow an agent to estimate the counterfactual reward it would have received had it taken an alternative action. We empirically show that CLEAN rewards outperform agents using both traditional global rewards and shaped difference rewards in two domains. I...|$|E

40|$|It {{is often}} the case that robotic systems require models, in order to {{successfully}} control themselves, and to interact with the world. Models take many forms and include kinematic models to plan motions, dynamics models to understand the interaction of forces, and models of 3 D geometry to check for collisions, to name but a few. Traditionally, models are provided to the robotic system by the designers that build the system. However, for long-term autonomy it becomes important for the robot to be able to build and maintain models of itself, and of objects it might encounter. In this thesis, the argument for enabling robotic systems to autonomously build models is advanced and explored. The main contribution of this research is to show how a layered approach can be taken to building models. Thus a robot, starting with a limited amount of information, can autonomously build a number of models, including a kinematic model, which describes the robot’s body, and allows it to plan and perform future movements. Key to the incremental, autonomous approach is the use of <b>exploratory</b> <b>actions.</b> These are actions that the robot can perform in order to gain some more information, either about itself, or about an object with which it is interacting. A method is then presented whereby a robot, after being powered on, can home its joints using just vision, i. e. traditional methods such as absolute encoders, or limit switches are not required. The ability to interact with objects in order to extract information {{is one of the main}} advantages that a robotic system has over a purely passive system, when attempting to learn about or build models of objects. In light of this, the next contribution of this research is to look beyond the robot’s body and to present methods with which a robot can autonomously build models of objects in the world around it. The first class of objects examined are flat pack cardboard boxes, a class of articulated objects with a number of interesting properties. It is shown how <b>exploratory</b> <b>actions</b> can be used to build a model of a flat pack cardboard box and to locate any hinges the box may have. Specifically, it is shown how when interacting with an object, a robot can combine haptic feedback from force sensors, with visual feedback from a camera to get more information from an object than would be possible using just a single sensor modality. The final contribution of this research is to present a series of <b>exploratory</b> <b>actions</b> for a robotic text reading system that allow text to be found and read from an object. The text reading system highlights how models of objects can take many forms, from a representation of their physical extents, to the text that is written on them...|$|R

40|$|According to the {{utilitarian}} paradigm, {{an autonomous}} intelligent agent's {{interactions with the}} environment should be guided by the principle of expected utility maximization.

Since the physical and <b>exploratory</b> <b>actions</b> that an agent could undertake transform the model of branching time lines in specific ways, the expected utilities of these actions can be computed, dictating rational tradeoffs among them depending on the agent's state of knowledge and {{the urgency of the}} situation. ...|$|R

Children who were severely deprived of emotional contact did not engage in much object manipulation, even though objects were accessible to them in their cribs (Lisina 1974; Spitz 1946).

The robot performs an <b>exploratory</b> <b>action</b> {{to the object}} to obtain the tactile information, however, poorly designed actions may not be sufficiently informative. In contrast, if we could collect sample data by sequentially performing informative actions, i. e., active learning, the required time would be drastically reduced. To this end, we propose a novel approach for active tactile object recognition. Our approach combines both an active learning scheme and a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method. We first extracts the object manifold, each coordinate of which represents an object, from tactile sensor data and action features using Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models. At the same time, a probabilistic model of the observed data related to the action and the object are learned. Then, with the learned model, optimally-informative exploratory actions can be computed sequentially, and performed to efficiently collect the data for recognition. We show experimental results that verify the effectiveness of our proposed method with synthetic data and a real robot. I...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Creating robots {{that can}} act {{autonomously}} in dynamic, unstructured environments {{is a major}} challenge. In such environments, learning to recognize and manipulate novel objects is an important capability. A truly autonomous robot acquires knowledge through interaction with its environment without using heuristics or prior information encoding human domain insights. Static images often provide insufficient information for inferring the relevant properties of the objects in a scene. Hence, a robot needs to explore these objects by interacting with them. However, there may be many <b>exploratory</b> <b>actions</b> possible, and {{a large portion of}} these actions may be non-informative. To learn quickly and efficiently, a robot must select actions that are expected to have the most informative outcomes. In the proposed bottom-up approach, the robot achieves this goal by quantifying the expected informativeness of its own actions. We use this approach to segment a scene into its constituent objects as a first step in learning the properties and affordances of objects. Evaluations showed that the proposed information-theoretic approach allows a robot to efficiently infer the composite structure of its environment. I...|$|R
