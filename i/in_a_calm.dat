5|$|Several actors {{campaigned for}} the leading role; ultimately, Eastwood decided that Jolie's face would suit the 1920s period setting. The film also stars Jeffrey Donovan, Jason Butler Harner, John Malkovich, Michael Kelly, and Amy Ryan. While some {{characters}} are composites, most {{are based on}} actual people. Principal photography, which began on October 15, 2007, and concluded {{a few weeks later}} in December, took place in Los Angeles and other locations in southern California. Actors and crew noted that Eastwood's low-key direction resulted <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> set and short working days. In post-production, scenes were supplemented with computer-generated skylines, backgrounds, vehicles and people.|$|E
5|$|After delays, {{the voyage}} began on 27 December 1831; it lasted almost five years. As FitzRoy had intended, Darwin {{spent most of}} that time on land {{investigating}} geology and making natural history collections, while HMS Beagle surveyed and charted coasts. He kept careful notes of his observations and theoretical speculations, and at intervals during the voyage his specimens were sent to Cambridge together with letters including a copy of his journal for his family. He had some expertise in geology, beetle collecting and dissecting marine invertebrates, but in all other areas was a novice and ably collected specimens for expert appraisal. Despite suffering badly from seasickness, Darwin wrote copious notes while on board the ship. Most of his zoology notes are about marine invertebrates, starting with plankton collected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> spell.|$|E

25|$|Buddhism {{sees the}} {{experience}} of dying as a very sensitive moment in one's spiritual life because the quality of one's mind {{at the time of}} death is believed to condition one's future rebirth. The Buddhist ideal is to die <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> but conscious state, while learning to let go. Dying consciously, without negative thoughts but rather joyously with good thoughts in mind is seen as a good transition into the next life. Chanting and reciting Buddhist texts is a common practice; in Tibet the Bardo Thodol is used to guide the dying to a good rebirth.|$|E

By the end of the 1920s, six more Barbarossa ships had met their ends at the hands of shipbreakers, and none of the remaining three ships would survive the next decade.

25|$|Convinced that unaided, the Banner, Green Hulk and Grey Hulk identities would {{eventually}} destroy each other, Doc Samson uses hypnosis to merge the three {{to create a}} new single identity combining Banner's intelligence with the Grey Hulk's and Banner's attitudes, and the Green Hulk's body. This new or Merged Hulk considered himself cured and began a new life, but the merger was not perfect, and the Hulk sometimes still considered Banner a separate person, and when overcome with rage, the Merged Hulk would transform back into Banner's human body while still thinking himself the Hulk. The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations and has a higher base line. While <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> emotional state, the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm. Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Grey Hulk, Bruce Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation. The safeguard is that when the Merged Hulk gets angry, he regresses back to Bruce Banner with the mind of the Savage Hulk.|$|E

According to Plutarch, he avoided using gimmicks in his speeches, unlike the passionate Demosthenes, and always spoke <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> and tranquil manner.

500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns to}} Dunder Mifflin with Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) to find Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) in the manager's chair. Andy enlists Robert California (James Spader) to give Andy his job back, which fails. Nellie further asserts her {{authority}} when she orders Angela Lipton (Angela Kinsey) to dock Andy's paycheck twice, and she complies. This causes Andy to have sexual performance difficulties with Erin. Erin asks Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) {{if he had}} similar problems after his loss of the manager position, which he denies. After Dwight tells Nellie that she has affected Andy's sex life, she begins to feel guilty. She holds a meeting where the office workers share {{advice on how to}} sexually perform. After the meeting, when Nellie makes another innuendo about Andy's problems, Erin loses her temper by yelling at Nellie to shut up, throwing her office phone to the ground, followed by Nellie's memo forms, pens, and her caramel. This gives Andy, filled with anger, the freedom to vent by throwing his desk chair at Robert, throwing Nellie's picture frame to the ground, and finally punching his hand through the wall (echoing his behavior in the third season episode [...] "The Return"). When Robert then chooses Nellie as regional manager, Andy refuses to accept a demotion by saying [...] "no" [...] too many times <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>calm</b> way, and a surprised Robert fires him. As a result, Andy regains his sense of self-confidence and is once again able to perform.|$|E
