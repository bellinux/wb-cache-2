40|$|Risk in {{pregnancy}} relates to events {{which lead to}} perinatal morbidity and mortality. Numerous risk scoring systems have been devised to bring attention to risk factors so that problems can be prevented, identified and treated. However, by carrying out very few fundamental assessments at regular antenatal office visits: checking blood pressure, testing urine for protein, measuring the symphysis to fundus height and carefully establishing the <b>expected</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>confinement</b> during the first trimester, the principal causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality—intrauterine growth retardation, prematurity, congenital anomalies, infection, abruptio placentae and meconium aspiration—can be identified and treated. Appropriate perinatal management of the very premature fetus/neonate (less than 34 weeks gestation) is a critical factor which will influence outcome. Whenever possible the mother should be transferred to a centre equipped and staffed for all necessary intrapartum and neonatal care, {{to minimize the risk}} of adverse outcome: postnatal transfer of the deteriorating, sick, small neonate is at best hazardous...|$|E
40|$|Objective 　To {{analyze the}} {{difference}} of the delivery date reckoned by traditional and modified formula for calculating the <b>expected</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>confinement</b> (EDC). Methods 　The data of 2055 women (37 - 41 + 6 week) were collected who gave monotocousa term spontaneous birth in the Chongqing Health Center for Women and Children from Jan. 2014 to Feb. 2015. Of which 1300 were primipara, and 755 were multipara; and the data of 1224 women (39 - 41 week) were collected, of which 832 were primipara, and 392 were multipara. The expected date was calculated with traditional and modified calculating formula, and then the actual delivery date was used for comparison and statistical analysis. Results 　The coincidence of actual delivery date with the estimated due date reckoned by traditional formula (39 - 41 week) was 8. 4 % in primipara and 9. 7 % in multipara, and the coincidence reckoned by modified formula was 11. 9 % in primipara and 14. 8 % in multipara. The EDC estimated by modified formula was more precise than that calculated by traditional formula (P< 0. 05). Conclusion 　The EDC calculated with modified formula is more accurate than that calculated with traditional formula. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2017. 03. 1...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundMaternal {{mortality}} ratio (MMR) in India is 200 / 100, 000 live births, many {{of which}} are preventable. To reduce MMR, the Government of India has set up basic obstetric ultrasonography facilities in primary health centers. This service was introduced in a nurse-run, low-risk antenatal and delivery service in an urban health center. This report documents the benefit of prenatal ultrasound in an urban health center. MethodsThis is a retrospective observational study carried out in an urban health center of a tertiary medical college and hospital, which provides health services to the economically disadvantaged urban population. The urban health center runs a nurse-led low-risk antenatal and delivery service. All consecutive antenatal ultrasounds from March 2012 to February 2013 were analyzed. Routine obstetric ultrasound was done for all women at their booking visit. Crown-rump length was measured if the first visit was prior to 13 weeks of gestation. If they presented after 13 weeks of gestation, biparietal diameter and femur length were measured to confirm gestational age. ResultsA total of 715 obstetric ultrasounds were performed during the period from 2012 to 2013. Among the 715 ultrasounds, 71. 6 % were for estimation of gestational age and 15. 7 % were for amniotic fluid index estimation for fetal surveillance. Among the dating ultrasounds performed, 48. 6 % were for primigravida women and 51. 4 % were for multigravida women. Discrepancies were identified in the <b>expected</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>confinement</b> by the last menstrual period in 26 % of the dating ultrasounds and 4. 2 % of women were identified to have a missed abortion at booking visit. ConclusionMaternal morbidity and mortality can be reduced by early detection of missed abortion, placenta previa, twin pregnancy, and molar pregnancy by routine obstetric ultrasound at booking visit. Routine obstetric ultrasound at the first and second trimesters had obvious benefits in confirming the expected date of delivery in a community where remembering the last menstrual period was not a priority. Introduction of this procedure helped in appropriate management of post-term pregnancies...|$|E
40|$|The World Health Organization-Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO-CIDI) is {{a highly}} {{structured}} interview {{for the assessment of}} mental disorders, based on the definitions and criteria of the fourth edition of the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). Over the past decade it has become evident that the CIDI does not sufficiently address the assessment needs of women. Women are affected by most mental disorders, particularly mood and anxiety disorders, approximately twice as frequently as men. Women-specific disorders, such as Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS), Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD), psychiatric disorders during pregnancy and postpartum as well as during the perimenopause, menopause and beyond are not addressed by the standard CIDI diagnostic modules. In addition, the CIDI in its current form does not address the potential effect that female reproductive milestones may have on diagnosis, treatment and prevention of mental disorders in women. Our aim was to develop a new women specific platform (CIDI-VENUS; CIDI-V) to be embedded in the existing CIDI that will address the above mentioned current deficiencies. Guided by a team of experts in the field of Women’s Mental Health from Canada and Germany the following modules were developed: 1) A complete menstrual history and comprehensive contraceptive history with a link to the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST). 2) A complete perinatal history of pregnancies, miscarriages, terminations, still births, death of a child, with details of current pregnancy including gestation and <b>expected</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>confinement,</b> labour history and breastfeeding, history of tobacco, alcohol, and other substance use including prescription drugs during pregnancy and postpartum, a section on specific phobias and on recurrent obsessive/compulsive thoughts/behaviours (OCD) related to the baby with a link to the Perinatal Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (POCS), as well as a link to the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). 3). A detailed history of use of hormone therapy (e. g. pills, patches, implants, etc.) with a focus on (peri-) menopausal women, differentiating between physical and psychological symptoms with a link to the Menopause Visual Analogue Scales (M-VAS) and to the Greene Climacteric Scale. 4) An iterative module concluding each CIDI section to specify the course of mental disorders during the reproductive stages and menopausal transition. While retaining core diagnostic sections and diagnostic algorithms, the CIDI-V is enriched by women-specific diagnostic modules, providing a wealth of clinically relevant information about women’s mental health, not available anywhere else in our current psychiatric diagnostic instruments...|$|E

40|$|Under some {{defined benefit}} pension plans (typically foreign plans), the actuarial {{present value of}} {{benefits}} to which an employee is entitled if the employee terminates immediately may exceed the actuarial present value of benefits to which the employee is entitled at <b>expected</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> separation based on service to date. For example, {{the provisions of the}} Italian severance pay statute require that, in most cases, the benefit an employee has accrued for service to date is payable immediately upon separation. The undiscounted value of that benefit payable currently would exceed the actuarial present value of that benefit if payment is estimated to occur at the employee's <b>expected</b> termination <b>date.</b> Another example arises in the United Kingdom where legislation requires that deferred vested benefits of terminated employees be statutorily revalued from <b>date</b> <b>of</b> separation to normal retirement age. If the vested benefit obligation (VBO) is determined assuming employee termination at the measurement date, that VBO could exceed the accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) if that obligation is measured giving consideration to a statutory revaluation only after the employee's <b>expected</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> termination. The issue is whether the VBO is the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is entitled if the employee separates immediately (Approach 1) or the actuarial present value of the vested benefits to which the employee is currently entitled but based on the employee's <b>expected</b> <b>date</b> <b>of</b> separation or retirement (Approach 2).
