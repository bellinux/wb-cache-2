500|$|Rosas's {{authority}} and influence spread {{far beyond the}} House of Representatives. He exercised tight control over the bureaucracy {{as well as his}} cabinet, stating: [...] "Do not imagine that my Ministers are anything but my Secretaries. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in their offices to listen and report, and nothing more." [...] His supporters were rewarded with positions within the state apparatus, and anyone he deemed a threat was purged. Opposition newspapers were burned in public squares. Rosas created an elaborate cult of personality, presenting himself as an almighty and fatherlike figure who protected the people. His portraits were carried in street demonstrations and placed on church altars to be venerated. Rosismo was no longer a mere faction within the Federalist ranks; it had become a political movement. As early as 1829, Rosas had confided to an Uruguayan diplomatic envoy: [...] "I tell you I am not a Federalist, and I have never belonged to that party." [...] During his governorship, he still claimed to have favoured Federalism against Unitarianism, although in practice Federalism had by that time been subsumed into the Rosismo movement.|$|E
2500|$|He {{also sought}} to break from the class-conscious {{conventions}} of the 1930s and early 40s, when top hat and tails or tuxedos were the norm, by dancing in casual or everyday work clothes, {{so as to make}} his dancing more relevant to the cinema-going public. As his first wife, actress and dancer Betsy Blair explained: [...] "A sailor suit or his white socks and loafers, or the T-shirts on his muscular torso, gave everyone the feeling that he was a regular guy, and perhaps they too could express love and joy by dancing in the street or stomping through puddles...he democratized the dance in movies." [...] In particular, he wanted to create a completely different image from that associated with Fred Astaire, not least because he believed his physique didn't suit such refined elegance: [...] "I used to envy his cool aristocratic style, so intimate and contained. Fred wears top hat and tails to the Manor born — <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on and look like a truck driver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, signor. <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> into my doublet when I saw you approaching, {{thinking}} {{that you would}} probably wish me to take them on shore at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, they didn’t," [...] ses Bob. [...] "I’m {{not going}} to tell any lies about it; <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>’em</b> there. The {{partridges}} in my inside coat-pocket and the bill in my waistcoat-pocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laws, yes!" [...] said Dinah; [...] "thar is whar <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>'em,</b> now. <b>I</b> couldn't 'member. Them 's {{particular}} onions I was a savin' for dis yer very stew. I'd forgot {{they was}} in dat ar old flannel." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laws, yes, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>'em</b> {{there this}} morning,--I likes {{to keep my}} things handy," [...] said Dinah. [...] "You, Jake! what are you {{stopping}} for! You'll cotch it! Be still, thar!" [...] she added, with a dive of her stick at the criminal.|$|R
6000|$|... "Death {{happened}} to the Motombo, Hans. Here, Stephen, give me your hand and my clothes, and, Mavovo, hold the rifle and the canoe while <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll hammer {{your nose}} red-hot," [...] replied Dove, with a most undovelike scowl, [...] "I could swear that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> matches {{in my pocket}} before I started." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, I'm {{a bit of}} a mongrel--not quite a pure Forsyte. I {{never take}} the halfpennies off my cheques, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on," [...] said Jolyon uneasily.|$|E
5000|$|... "If <b>I</b> Could <b>Put</b> <b>Them</b> All Together (I'd Have You)" [...] (Even Stevens) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'm so {{glad you}} agree with me,' he says. 'My command here I regard as a {{training}} depot, and you, if I may say so, {{have been one of}} my most efficient instructors. I mature my men slowly but thoroughly. First <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>'em</b> in a town which is liable to be attacked by night, where they can attend riding-school in the day. Then I use 'em with a convoy, and last <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>'em</b> into a column. It takes time,' he says, 'but I flatter myself that any men who have worked under me are at least grounded in the rudiments of their profession. Adrian,' he says, 'was there anything wrong with the men who upset Van Bester's applecart last month when he was trying to cross the line to join Piper with those horses he'd stole from Gabbitas?' ...|$|R
60|$|Rho. Ay, too many, Palamede. If <b>I</b> could <b>put</b> <b>them</b> {{into three}} or four women, I should be content.|$|R
6000|$|Then I {{thought of}} the curate's sovereigns. If he has missed them already, what should I return to? And, even if I returned, how could <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> back? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure I did!" [...] shouted Dick. [...] "Just the thing--if {{they are}} still on board. And they may be--for <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in a closet we don't often use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{not what}} I asked you," [...] shouted the consul, growing brave quite fast; [...] "answer my {{questions}} as <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them,</b> or I'll {{find a way}} to make you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not. One can't {{think of}} everything. Now, {{if you will}} just hand me those diamonds, <b>I</b> will <b>put</b> <b>them</b> back where they belong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [10] These {{words were}} {{introduced}} after the author's decease. Not {{being able to}} discover by what authority they were added, <b>I</b> have <b>put</b> <b>them</b> within brackets--(ED).|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hate the}} sight of <b>them!</b> If <b>I</b> could <b>put</b> <b>them</b> and their blessed copybooks and lexicons and slates into one bonfire I'd do it to-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have the}} oars. It would be uncommonly hard work, rowing, {{but it would}} keep us afloat. It was just a chance that <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in--a lucky one as it happens." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is queer, mighty queer," [...] {{said the}} teacher to himself. [...] "Now, let me think what I did with them. Yes, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in the glass, I am {{positive}} of it!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] hesitated Toby, [...] "there was two {{doughnuts}} an' a {{piece of}} pie left over, an' <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in my pocket. If you don't care, I'll eat them some time tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|So, at last, lest he divide us, [...] <b>I</b> would <b>put</b> <b>them</b> to the test. [...] There was no {{one there}} beside us, [...] Save this interloping guest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Am <b>I</b> to <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in your desk?" [...] asked Caroline, bewildered {{as to his}} intentions, {{and finding}} it hard to read the writing, as he went on—- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{will put}} {{him into a}} song that will bring shame and sorrow over him; but tell me how many years has he, for <b>I</b> would <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in the song?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; that's {{my way of}} {{carrying}} manuscript. The real reason is, that I mostly write bits of it on scraps of paper when I am on horseback; and <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> there for convenience.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{are three}} checks," [...] he remarked, [...] "which I cannot trace. One for ten {{thousand}} pounds, another for five, {{and a third}} for a thousand pounds. What account shall <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> to?" ...|$|E
60|$|MARCAIRE. Now, my lord, follow me: I {{take them}} up; you see? <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in my pocket; you follow me? This is my hat; {{here is my}} stick; and here is my--my friend's bundle.|$|E
60|$|Rose. Sir, I {{beg your}} pardon; I thought <b>I</b> had <b>put</b> <b>them</b> up amongst my lady's things, and it seems, in my haste, I quite forgot them, {{and left them}} at Canterbury.|$|R
6000|$|... "His Grace {{is not in}} {{the habit}} of posting letters himself," [...] said he. [...] "This letter was laid with others upon the study table, and <b>I</b> myself <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in the post-bag." ...|$|R
60|$|I cannot {{write what}} I wish; I {{had so many}} things to say, I seem to have said none. It is so with the remembrances we send. <b>I</b> cannot <b>put</b> <b>them</b> into words.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{could not}} get down very well to give the oranges to her, so <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in my little knapsack, and let them down by a string. I had the string in my pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{since you}} insist on it, I guess I'll have to write the thing; but I can't leave my team {{standing}} in the frost. Sit down and take a smoke while <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] replied Thorne, {{somewhat}} ruefully, [...] "I certainly didn't mean to. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in {{to bring}} their feathers off, though I've hitherto generally done it beneath the blow-down valve of a thrashing engine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yesterday I {{could have}} offered you a certain name. I only {{cared for the}} honours they gave me so that <b>I</b> might <b>put</b> <b>them</b> at your feet. But what can I offer you now?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, Godfrey. I {{have got}} a packet of capital {{surgical}} needles, and some silk. <b>I</b> will <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in with the others; they won't take up much room. Well, shall we start to-morrow night?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Corvick almost groaned. [...] "Oh you know, <b>I</b> don't <b>put</b> <b>them</b> back to {{back that}} way; it's the infancy of art! But {{he gives me a}} {{pleasure}} so rare; the sense of"--he mused a little--"something or other." ...|$|R
