40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} {{techniques}} {{for the full}} integration of radio frequency (RF) transmitter with CMOS technology. The theory and implementation of high performance digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for radio frequency (RF) transmitters have been studied. A linear interpolation DAC architecture is proposed. By employing the linear interpolation, the attenuation of DAC's image components is significantly increased. The proposed linear interpolation DAC {{has been applied to}} direct <b>digital</b> quadrature <b>modulators.</b> The reconstruction filter, usually employed after the DAC in modulators to remove the image components, is eliminated due to this linear interpolation DAC's high attenuation to the image components. Therefore, the costly discrete components are reduced, and the system-onchip (SOC) design can be realized conveniently. A CMOS current injection direct <b>digital</b> RF quadrature <b>modulator</b> and A CMOS current-folded direct <b>digital</b> RF quadrature <b>modulator</b> have been implemented.

40|$|Abstract—In {{digitally}} controlled dc–dc converters with {{a single}} voltage feedback loop, the two quantizers, namely the analog-to-digital (A/D) converter and the <b>digital</b> pulse-width <b>modulator</b> (DPWM), can cause undesirable limit-cycle oscilla-tions. In this paper, static and dynamic models that include the quantization effects are derived and used to explain the origins of limit-cycle oscillations. In the static model, existence of dc solution, which is a necessary no-limit-cycle condition, is examined using a graphical method. Based on the generalized describing function method, the amplitude and offset-dependent gain model of a quantizer is applied to derive the dynamic system model. From the static and dynamic models, no-limit-cycle conditions associated with A/D, DPWM and compensator design criteria are derived. The conclusions are illustrated by simulation and experimental examples. Index Terms—DC–DC power conversion, digital control, <b>digital</b> pulse-width <b>modulator</b> (DPWM), quantization...|$|R
