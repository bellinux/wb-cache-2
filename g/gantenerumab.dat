40|$|Abstract. The amyloid- {{lowering}} {{capacity of}} anti-A antibodies {{has been demonstrated}} in transgenic models of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and in AD patients. While the mechanism of immunotherapeutic amyloid- removal is controversial, antibody-mediated sequestration of peripheral A versus microglial phagocytic activity and disassembly of cerebral amyloid (or a combination thereof) has been proposed. For successful A immunotherapy, we hypothesized that high affinity antibody binding to amyloid- plaques and recruitment of brain effector cells is required for most efficient amyloid clearance. Here we report the generation of a novel fully human anti-A antibody, <b>gantenerumab,</b> optimized in vitro for binding with sub-nanomolar affinity to a conformational epitope expressed on amyloid- fibrils using HuCAL ® phage display technologies. In peptide maps, both N-terminal and central portions of A were recognized by <b>gantenerumab.</b> Remarkably, a novel orientation of N-terminal A bound to the complementarity determining regions was identified by x-ray analysis of a <b>gantenerumab</b> Fab-A 1 - 11 complex. In functional assays <b>gantenerumab</b> induced cellular phagocytosis of human amyloid- deposits in AD brain slices when co-cultured with primary human macrophages and neutralized oligomeric A 42 -mediated inhibitory effects on long-term potentiation in rat brain. In APP 751 swedishxPS 2 N 141 I transgenic mice, <b>gantenerumab</b> showed sustained binding to cerebral amyloid- and, upon chronic treatment, significantly reduced small amyloid- plaques by recruiting microglia and prevented new plaque formation. Unlike other A antibodies, <b>gantenerumab</b> did not alter plasma A suggesting undisturbed systemic clearance of soluble A...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Gantenerumab</b> is a fully human anti-Aβmonoclonal {{antibody}} {{in clinical}} {{development for the}} treatment of Alzheimer disease (AD). Objectives: To investigate whether treatment with <b>gantenerumab</b> leads to a measurable reduction in the level of Aβ amyloid in the brain and to elucidate the mechanism of amyloid reduction. Design: A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending-dose positron emission tomographic study. Additionally, ex vivo studies of human brain slices from an independent sample of patients who had AD were performed. Setting: Three university medical centers. Patients: Patients with mild-to-moderate AD. Intervention: Two consecutive cohorts of patients received 2 to 7 infusions of intravenous <b>gantenerumab</b> (60 or 200 mg) or placebo every 4 weeks. Brain slices from patients who had AD were coincubated with <b>gantenerumab</b> at increasing concentrations and with human microglial cells. Main Outcome Measures: Percent change in the ratio of regional carbon 11 -labeled Pittsburgh Compound B retention in vivo and semiquantitative assessment of gantenerumab-induced phagocytosis ex vivo. Results: Sixteen patients with end-of-treatment positron emission tomographic scans were included in the analysis. The mean (95 % CI) percent change from baseline difference relative to placebo (n= 4) in cortical brain amyloid level was - 15. 6 % (95 % CI, - 42. 7 to 11. 6) for the 60 -mg group (n= 6) and - 35. 7 % (95 % CI, - 63. 5 to - 7. 9) for the 200 -mg group (n= 6). Two patients in the 200 -mg group showed transient and focal areas of inflammation or vasogenic edema on magnetic resonance imaging scans at sites with the highest level of amyloid reduction. <b>Gantenerumab</b> induced phagocytosis of human amyloid in a dose-dependent manner ex vivo. Conclusion: <b>Gantenerumab</b> treatment resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in brain amyloid level, possibly through an effector cell-mediated mechanism of action. © 2012 American Medical Association.

40|$|Introduction: Currently {{available}} drugs against Alzheimer’s disease (AD) target cholinergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions without {{affecting the}} underlying disease process. Putative disease-modifying drugs are in development and target β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide and tau protein, the principal neurophatological hallmarks of the disease. Areas covered: Phase III clinical studies of emerging anti-Aβ drugs {{for the treatment}} of AD were searched in US and EU clinical trial registries and in the medical literature until May 2016. Expert opinion: Drugs in Phase III clinical development for AD include one inhibitor of the β-secretase cleaving enzyme (BACE) (verubecestat), three anti-Aβ monoclonal antibodies (solanezumab, <b>gantenerumab,</b> and aducanumab), an inhibitor of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) (azeliragon) and the combination of cromolyn sodium and ibuprofen (ALZT-OP 1). These drugs are mainly being tested in subjects during early phases of AD or in subjects at preclinical stage of familial AD or even in asymptomatic subjects at high risk of developing AD. The hope is to intervene in the disease process when it is not too late. However, previous clinical failures with anti-Aβ drugs and the lack of fully understanding of the pathophysiological role of Aβ in the development of AD, put the new drugs at substantial risk of failure...|$|E
40|$|Immunotherapy is a {{promising}} {{strategy for the}} treatment of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Antibodies directed against Amyloid Beta (A?) are able to successfully clear plaques and reverse cognitive deficits in mouse models. Excitement towards this approach has been tempered by high profile failures in the clinic, one key issue has been the development of inflammatory side effects in the brain (ARIAs). New antibodies are entering the clinic for Alzheimer’s disease; therefore, it is important to learn all we can from the current generation. In this study, we directly compared 3 clinical candidates in the same pre-clinical model, with the same effector function, for their ability to clear plaques and induce inflammation in the brain. We produced murine versions of the antibodies: Bapineuzumab (3 D 6), Crenezumab (mC 2) and <b>Gantenerumab</b> (chGantenerumab) with an IgG 2 a constant region. 18 -month transgenic APP mice (Tg 2576) were injected bilaterally into the hippocampus with 2 µg of each antibody or control. After 7 days, the mice tissue was analysed for clearance of plaques and neuroinflammation by histology and biochemical analysis. 3 D 6 was the best binder to plaques and in vitro, whilst mC 2 bound the least strongly. This translated into 3 D 6 effectively clearing plaques and reducing the levels of insoluble A?, whilst chGantenerumab and mC 2 did not. 3 D 6 caused {{a significant increase in the}} levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL- 1 ? and TNF?, and an associated increase in microglial expression of CD 11 B and CD 68. chGantenerumab increased pro-inflammatory cytokines and microglial activation, but minimal changes in CD 68, as an indicator of phagocytosis. Injection of mC 2 did not cause any significant inflammatory changes. Our results demonstrate that the ability of an antibody to clear plaques and induce inflammation is dependent on the epitope and affinity of the antibody...|$|E
