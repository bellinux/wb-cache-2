5|$|Sheep {{are not an}} {{important}} part of China's agricultural economy, since the majority of China does not have the large open pastures required for sheep-rearing. Sheep farming is more common in the northwestern provinces of the country, where such tracts of land exist. China <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> native sheep breed, the zhan. The population of the breed has been in decline since 1985, despite government promotion of the breed.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to find out the effect of auditor experience, competence, audit risk, ethics, {{adherence}} pressure, and gender to the accuracy of auditors opinion, directly or indirectly, by using auditor professional skepticism as an intervening variable. The research was conducted in KAP Kota Pekanbaru and KAP Medan City. The samples were obtained randomly as many as 79 respondents. The data were analyzed by using Partial Least Square (PLS) techniques with SmartPLS 2. 0 M 3 versions. The results showed that auditor experience <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Secondly, competence <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Third, audit risk <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Fourth, ethics <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Fifth, adherence pressure <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relation to the accuracy on giving opinion. Sixth, gender <b>did</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significant relationship to the accuracy of auditors opinion. From the indirect test, the result showed that the variable of auditors professional skepticism was able to strengthen the competence relation and situation of the accuracy of auditors opinion. In the other hand, the variable of auditors professional skepticism was not able to strengthen the relationship of ethics and pressure to the accuracy of auditors opinion.

Stewie finds Brian crying in the bathtub, and, seeing how upset Brian is and feeling sorry for him, Stewie successfully fakes his death by putting his collar (which Brian hadn't been wearing) on a stray and killing it in a liquor store fire. The Griffins are devastated upon learning about Brian's supposed death, and realize how close a friend he was to them. Seeing this, Stewie rushes upstairs to show Brian how much the Griffins still care about him, regardless of his species. Brian then realizes his life <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> purpose and thanks Stewie for helping him, and decides to remain hidden to let the Griffins grieve a little longer.|$|E
5|$|Consisting of two quasars with a {{separation}} of less than 5 arcseconds, the quasar pair 4C 11.50 {{is one of the}} visually closest pairs of quasars in the sky. The two have markedly different redshifts, however, and are thus unrelated. The foreground member of the pair (4C 11.50 A) does not have enough mass to refract light from the background component (4C 11.50 B) enough to produce a lensed image, although it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> true companion of its own. An even stranger galaxy pair is 3C 321. Unlike the previous pair, the two galaxies making up 3C 321 are interacting with each other and {{are in the process of}} merging. Both members appear to be active galaxies; the primary radio galaxy may be responsible for the activity in the secondary by means of the former's jet driving material onto the latter's supermassive black hole.|$|E

5|$|From the {{descriptions}} of the rules above, two important properties of its dynamics may immediately be seen. First, in Rule 184, for any finite set of cells with periodic boundary conditions, the number of 1s {{and the number of}} 0s in a pattern remains invariant throughout the pattern's evolution. Rule 184 and its reflection are the only elementary cellular automata to have this property of number conservation. Similarly, if the density of 1s is well-defined for an infinite array of cells, it remains invariant as the automaton carries out its steps. And second, although Rule 184 is not symmetric under left-right reversal, it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> different symmetry: reversing left and right {{and at the same time}} swapping the roles of the 0 and 1 symbols produces a cellular automaton with the same update rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{density of}} indium, 7.31g/cm3, is also greater than gallium, but lower than thallium. Below the {{critical}} temperature, 3.41K, indium becomes a superconductor. At standard temperature and pressure, indium crystallizes in the face-centered tetragonal crystal {{system in the}} space group I4/mmm (lattice parameters:a=325pm, c=495pm): this is a slightly distorted face-centered cubic structure, where each indium atom has four neighbours at 324pm distance and eight neighbours slightly further (336pm). Indium displays a ductile viscoplastic response, found to be size-independent in tension and compression. However it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> size effect in bending and indentation, associated to a length-scale of order 50–100µm, significantly large when compared with other metals.|$|E
5|$|The larvae of {{a number}} of species of moth use the leaves as a food source. These include the {{sycamore}} moth (Acronicta aceris), the maple prominent (Ptilodon cucullina) and the plumed prominent (Ptilophora plumigera). The horse-chestnut leaf miner (Cameraria ohridella) occasionally lays its eggs on the sycamore, although 70% of the larvae do not survive beyond the second instar. The leaves attract aphids, and also the ladybirds and hoverflies that feed on them. The flowers produce copious amounts of nectar and pollen and are attractive to bees and other insects, and the seeds are eaten by small mammals such as voles and birds. As an introduced plant, in Britain the sycamore has a relatively small associated insect fauna of about 15 species, but it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> larger range of leafhoppers than does the native field maple.|$|E

In order to escape from an awkward suitor whom Logan introduces her to, Veronica asks Piz {{to pretend to be}} her boyfriend. Afterwards, Wallace informs her that Piz <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> crush on her. Veronica realizes that she has not realized this because of her preoccupation with her breakup with Logan. She talks to Piz on the porch at the party, and he suddenly kisses her. Piz retreats to the elevator, but Veronica appears and kisses him back. The elevator opens, revealing Logan.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament and Council {{have been}} {{compared}} to the two chambers of a bicameral legislature. However, there are some differences from national legislatures; for example, neither the Parliament nor the Council have the power of legislative initiative (except {{for the fact that}} the Council has the power in some intergovernmental matters). In Community matters, this is a power uniquely reserved for the European Commission (the executive). Therefore, while Parliament can amend and reject legislation, to make a proposal for legislation, it needs the Commission to draft a bill before anything can become law. The value of such a power has been questioned by noting that in the national legislatures of the member states 85% of initiatives introduced without executive support fail to become law. Yet it has been argued by former Parliament president Hans-Gert Pöttering that as the Parliament does have the right to ask the Commission to draft such legislation, and as the Commission is following Parliament's proposals more and more Parliament <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> de facto right of legislative initiative.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the fact}} that it is not a genetic ability and thus is very rare, the Rinnegan has been {{regarded}} as a legend with only the Sage of Six Paths known to acquire it. However, the reincarnations of Hagoromo's sons, Indra and Asura, can potentially access Rinnegan by having the genes of both reincarnations, as in the case of Madara (Indra's reincarnation), who obtained the DNA of Hashirama (Asura's reincarnation), although he only awoke the Rinnegan near the end of his natural lifespan. This is considered a wrongful act by Hagoromo as he attempted to leave a message in the form of a stone tablet for Indra's descendants to reconsider the act. The Rinnegan is shown to be transplantable, as Madara was able to implant his Rinnegan into the young Nagato, and Obito takes up Madara's left Rinnegan to use it in conjunction with his Sharingan. After meeting with Hagoromo, Sasuke, who is the current reincarnation of Indra, awakens a Rinnegan in his left eye, which has an additional six tomoe on top of the ripple pattern, making it closer to the Rinne Sharingan in appearance. His Rinnegan allows him to perform , which can shift himself, others, and objects a set distance away from his original location. He can increase the range of this technique by instantaneously changing place with a remote space. Due to its speed, this technique has proven to be especially useful for launching surprise attacks against enemies within its range. While there is no prerequisite for using the technique, it <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> recharging period after each use. Once fully mastered it can even cross dimensions but requires a large amount of chakra and drains his dōjutsu of its power for an extended period of time.|$|E
