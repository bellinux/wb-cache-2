Case Presentation A 35 - year old male patient sought medical attention due to malaise, joint pain, and a 2 week old fever. When interrogated the patient referred joint pain in the fingers and hand joints, reported having photosensitivity, even when exposed briefly to direct sunlight and a higher than 39 °C fever, without a specific time of onset in various occasions.

40|$|Malaria {{is caused}} by Plasmodium parasites and is the world’s most devastating {{tropical}} infectious disease. The need for identifying novel drug targets is fuelled by an increased resistance of these parasites against available drugs. The human host red cell membrane {{plays an important role}} during invasion and subsequent development of the parasite within the red cell and undergoes several structural, functional and biochemical changes triggered by various protein-protein interactions between the parasite and the host cells. These interactions form a fundamental part of malaria research, since the parasite spends the pathogenic stage of its life cycle in the human erythrocyte. The Plasmodium kinome is complex and the exact role of protein phosphorylation in malaria parasites is not yet fully understood. This study aims to characterise the kinase domain of Plasmodium falciparum (3 D 7) Protein Kinase 8 (PfPK 8), described as a putative protein on the Plasmodium falciparum database. PfPK 8 is encoded by the PfB 0150 c gene (recently renamed as PF 3 D 7 _ 0203100) situated on chromosome 2 of the parasite genome. A 1 507 bp section of the PfB 0150 c gene, containing a 822 bp centrally located kinase domain was cloned into a pTriEx- 3 expression vector. A soluble recombinant octa-histidine-tagged PfPK 8 was expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE 3) cells, but with relatively low yield and purity. To improve the expression, a recombinant PfB 0150 c-baculovirus infected Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf 9) insect cell system was attempted, but without success. A different tag was employed and glutathione-S-transferase-PfPK 8 was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli Rosetta 2 (DE 3) cells, with a higher yield and purity. Recombinant GST-PfPK 8 was used in non-radioactive coupled spectrophotometric kinase assays in the presence of known kinase substrates casein, MBP and H 1 to determine kinetic parameters of the enzyme. It phosphorylated all three substrates at a temperature of 37 ºC and pH of 7. 4. Recombinant GST-PfPK 8 was inactive at a pH below 6 and most active at pH 7. 4. The relative activity of the enzyme was highest at a temperature synonymous to a <b>fever</b> <b>spike</b> in a Plasmodium falciparum infected individual. Secondary structural analysis of PfPK 8 revealed the position of a conserved substrate binding domain containing an ATP-binding site and binding loop within the kinase domain. The kinase domain of rPfPK 8 was modelled using available crystal structures of its identified homologues. The gene is expressed throughout the intraerythrocytic stages of the parasite life cycle, as well as in gametocytes. Protein-protein binding studies revealed that host-parasite protein-protein interactions exist between rPfPK 8 and erythrocyte membrane protein, band 3. Plasmodium falciparum PK 8 could therefore play a role during invasion of host erythrocytes and during the intraerythrocytic development of the parasite, by phosphorylating red blood cell membrane proteins. This study provides the groundwork for future X-ray crystallographic studies to elucidate the structure of the enzyme, and for additional gene manipulation experiments to ascertain whether it is essential for parasite survival in all the intraerythrocytic stages and therefore a potential new drug target candidate...|$|E

It typically has a rapid onset with high temperatures and marked fluctuations and responds poorly to antibiotics and antipyretics.

We report a 34 -year-old male with a right thalamic hemorrhage extending to the midbrain and into the ventricles. During his admission, he developed intractable fevers with core temperatures as high as 39. 3 °C. Infectious workup was unremarkable.
