50|$|In 391 AD, Alexandria {{is part of}} the Roman Empire, and Greek philosopher Hypatia is {{a teacher}} at the Platonic school, where future leaders are educated. Hypatia is the {{daughter}} of Theon, the director of the Musaeum of Alexandria. Hypatia, her father's slave, Davus, and two of her pupils, Orestes and Synesius, are immersed in the changing political and social landscape. She rejects Orestes's love (she offers him her bloody menstrual towel, to show him that love <b>has</b> its <b>drawbacks,</b> <b>while</b> studying <b>has</b> none): she prefers to devote herself to science. Davus assists Hypatia in her classes and is interested in science, and is also secretly in love with her.|$|R
40|$|Arguments {{about the}} optimum size for units of local {{government}} often overlook the fact that small units <b>have</b> some considerable <b>drawbacks</b> <b>while</b> large ones <b>have</b> some advantages. By and large the discussion breaks down into two parts; those about size and functional effectiveness, and those about size and democracy. On the first count, it seems that large units are no less efficient and {{can be a good}} deal more effective than small ones. On the question of size and democracy, the evidence suggests that large units of government are no less democratic than small ones, and that in some respects they may be more so...|$|R

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the changes Afrikaans has {{undergone}} since Dutch colonisers introduced Cape Dutch to the indigenous population. Afrikaans has been influenced through {{both internal and external}} language forces. The internal forces were driven by koineisation, while the external language forces are the results of language contact. The phonemic inventories of Afrikaans, Cape Dutch, Modern Standard Dutch, South African English, Xhosa and Zulu have been compared based on current and historical comparison studies. Internal language change has caused the voiced fricatives to fortify, <b>while</b> external <b>forces</b> <b>have</b> reintroduced voiced fricatives after fortition occurred. Xhosa and Zulu have influenced some vowels to become more nasalised, <b>while</b> internal <b>forces</b> <b>have</b> risen and centralised vowels and diphthongs. Contact with South African English has enriched the phonemic inventory with affricates...|$|R

50|$|In {{the later}} American War of Independence France signed a {{neutrality}} convention with Hanover, ruling out a French attack on Hanoverian soil. This was a recognition by the French leadership {{that it had}} been a mistake to attack Hanover in 1757 and pour so many troops and resources into the attempt to retake it - <b>while</b> British <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> been free to attack French colonies in the West Indies, Canada, Africa and India.|$|R

50|$|Explosives, {{especially}} the car bomb, become {{far more common}} in modern history, with grenades and remote-triggered land mines also used, especially in the Middle East and Balkans (the initial attempt on Archduke Franz Ferdinand's life was with a grenade).

The powder barrels were brought up, fuses were made, each six feet long, passing from barrel to barrel, and the chain of barrels was laid from the stern {{to the point where}} the deck was level with the water. This plan was adopted in order that the whole fabric should be shaken and broken up, <b>while,</b> <b>had</b> the whole <b>force</b> of the explosion taken place at one point, it would have entirely destroyed the timber there, while perhaps leaving a considerable portion still standing above the water.|$|R

[...] Dunmore's <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> fortified {{one side of a}} critical river crossing south of Norfolk at Great Bridge, <b>while</b> rebel <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> occupied the other side.

After his trial, Bo and Nora confront Inez over her attempt to seduce Bo, and Inez admits that she <b>had</b> been <b>forced</b> {{to do so by}} Clint. Initially skeptical, Bo and Nora realize that Inez is telling the truth upon looking at the evidence; namely, the high-priced lawyer {{assigned}} to Eddie when he assaulted James at Thanksgiving, and the fact that Clint had earlier threatened them with a shotgun. However, they nonetheless have Inez arrested for drugging Bo. Before she is taken away, Nora tells Inez that, <b>while</b> she <b>had</b> been <b>forced</b> to do all of this by Clint, the fact that she never bothered to simply come to {{them in the first place}} has convinced her that she was also, at least partly, trying to break them up of her own free will.|$|R

This caused dismay of this Chetnik unit which retreated from already captured positions. Muslim forces regrouped and pushed back the Chetnik forces who advanced on another part of front (Petrova Crkva — Đurđevi Stupovi — Parničko brdo — Vidovo).

On April 21, Lithuanian Hetman Szymon Kossakowski came to Wilno, urging the Russians to capture yet more rebels, and attack rebel forces concentrated around the city. Under the circumstances, Jakub Jasinski decided to initiate the insurrection. It began in the night of April 22 / 23, and after a short fight, the city was under rebel control.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the rationale for, and nature of, continuing professional education (CPE) within accountancy. Knowledge obsolescence, continuing legitimation of the licence {{to practice and}} professionalism have influenced the growth of CPE, as have economic, social, legal and political concerns in the U.

Common features of CPE as currently operated are the degree of latitude in what can be classified as CPE, issues of relevance and competence and differential requirements for accountants working in different areas. An examination of an alternative approach to CPE concentrates {{on the relationship between}} theory and practice and the notion of the reflective practitioner. The paper concludes that, <b>while</b> recent trends <b>have</b> <b>forced</b> the profession to reassess CPE, present requirements suggest an ambivalent attitude.
