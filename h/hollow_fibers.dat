50|$|A Hollow fiber {{bioreactor}} is a 3D cell culturing {{system based}} on <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers,</b> which are small, semi-permeable capillary membranes arranged in parallel array with a typical molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) range of 10-30 kDa. These hollow fiber membranes are often bundled and housed within tubular polycarbonate shells to create hollow fiber bioreactor cartridges. Within the cartridges, which are also fitted with inlet and outlet ports, are two compartments: the intracapillary (IC) space within the <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers,</b> and the extracapillary (EC) space surrounding the <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{heated air}} enters the membrane, {{which is made}} up of {{thousands}} of miniature <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers.</b> The walls of these fibers are semi-permeable and designed for different gases to move through them (or permeate) at different speeds. The resulting gas mixture is known as the permeate. As air flows through the <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers,</b> both oxygen and nitrogen permeate through the fiber walls. The oxygen permeates faster than the nitrogen, which produces permeate with an oxygen content greater than air. The gas that reaches the end of the <b>hollow</b> <b>fibers</b> without permeating is almost entirely nitrogen and is discharged. The resulting permeate contains approximately 44% O2 and is constant under all operating conditions.|$|E

At 900 °C and 100 mL min– 1 helium gas sweep rate, the oxygen fluxes for disk, conventional <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber,</b> modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber,</b> Ag-deposited modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber,</b> and Pt-deposited modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> membranes are 0. 10, 0. 33, 0. 84, 1. 42, and 2. 62 mL min– 1 cm– 2, respectively, denoting enhanced performance in this sequential order. More than 300 % enhancement of fluxes is evidenced by modifying the geometry from disk to conventional <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber.</b> This is attributed to the thickness reduction from 1 mm to 0. 3 mm, thus implying bulk-diffusion and surface reaction as the jointly limiting transport step for this disk membrane. In contrast to a conventional <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> that has a sandwich cross-sectional structure (e. g. dense center layer sandwiched by two finger-like layers) as well as dense outer and inner circumference surfaces, the modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> has only one dense layer in its outer circumference surface with finger-like porous layer extending {{all the way from}} outer cross-sectional part to the inner cross-sectional part. This microstructural difference, in turn, provides substantial reduction of membrane thickness and enlarges surface reaction area for modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> (relative to conventional <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber),</b> both of which contributes to the reduced bulk-diffusion and surface reaction resistance; evidenced by almost 250 % oxygen flux enhancement. To enhance the performance even further, catalyst (e. g., Ag or Pt) deposition on the outer circumference surface of modified <b>hollow</b> <b>fiber</b> can be utilized to reduce its dominating surface reaction resistance. While both catalysts increase the oxygen fluxes, Pt reveals itself as the better candidate relative to Ag due to melting-induced aggregation and growth of Ag at 950 °C. <br /...|$|R
