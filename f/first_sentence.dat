5|$|Initial {{writing for}} the first season was split between the Wachowskis and Straczynski. The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works is by first developing the entire script in his head, from the <b>first</b> <b>sentence</b> to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{had argued}} the {{empirical}} world {{is merely a}} complex of appearances whose existence and connection occur only in our representations.

40|$|This study {{reviews the}} {{importance}} of the <b>first</b> <b>sentences</b> in the <b>first</b> and second parts of (stories and novels) for the French author Mobasan. Why did we choose these parts? Because we could collect the <b>first</b> <b>sentences</b> in 31 stories divided into two parts, the first part includes 17 stories and the second one includes 14 stories. There are various topics in the two parts as Mobasan reviews scenes of everyday life, for example: the concept of death, lying, greed, tragedy and so on. Mobsan depends on the descriptive style in reviewing these scenes, and usually the <b>first</b> <b>sentences</b> of Mobasan's stories have great effect on the characters and morals of his stories...|$|R

25|$|Sentences of {{the second}} type are called false passives by some linguists, who feel that such {{sentences}} are simply confused with the passive voice due to their outward similarity. Other linguists consider the second type {{to be a different}} kind of passive – a stative or static passive, in contrast to the dynamic or eventive passive illustrated by the <b>first</b> <b>sentence.</b> Some languages express or can express these different meanings using different constructions.|$|E

Proponents claim {{that this is a}} reasonable measure, based on established custom, which defends the family and the institution of marriage. To others, it is an unfair means of excluding same-sex couples from receiving benefits from that institution. Civil right activists and supporters of the LGBT (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender) community feel that the Federal Marriage Amendment has no place in the United States constitution.|$|E
25|$|The Apocalypse of Moses (literally, the Revelation of Moses) is {{the usual}} name for the Greek version of the Life of Adam and Eve. This title was given to it by Tischendorf, its first editor, and taken up by others. In the text, Moses is {{referred}} to only in the <b>first</b> <b>sentence</b> as the prophet to whom the story was revealed. The Greek Apocalypse of Moses (not {{to be confused with}} the Assumption of Moses) is usually considered to predate the Latin Life of Adam and Eve.|$|E
25|$|Although the <b>first</b> <b>sentence</b> in this clause {{originally}} concerned apportionment of both House {{seats and}} taxes among the several states, the Fourteenth Amendment sentence that replaced it in 1868 mentioned only the apportionment of House seats. Even so, the constraint placed upon Congress's taxation power remained, as the restriction was reiterated in Article 1 Section 9 Clause 4. The amount of direct taxes {{that could be}} collected {{by the federal government}} from the people in any State would still be tied directly to that state's share of the national population.|$|E

25|$|The Apology of Socrates {{begins with}} Socrates {{addressing}} {{the jury to}} ask if the men of Athens (the jury) have been persuaded by the Orators Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus, who have accused Socrates of corrupting the young people {{of the city and}} of impiety against the pantheon of Athens. The <b>first</b> <b>sentence</b> of his speech establishes the theme of the dialogue — that philosophy begins with an admission of ignorance. Socrates later clarifies that point of philosophy when he says that whatever wisdom he possesses comes from knowing that he knows nothing (23b, 29b).|$|E
25|$|In Nobiin, every {{utterance}} {{ends in a}} low tone. This is one of {{the clearest}} signs of the occurrence of a boundary tone, realized as a low tone on the last syllable of any prepausal word. The examples below show how the surface tone of the high tone verb ókkír- ‘cook’ depends on the position of the verb. In the <b>first</b> <b>sentence,</b> the verb is not final (because the question marker –náà is appended) and thus it is realized as high. In the second sentence, the verb {{is at the end of}} the utterance, resulting in a low tone on the last syllable.|$|E
25|$|The partitive–indefinite pro-clitic re is {{used when}} the NP {{refers to a}} new, {{non-specific}} instance of a notion. In order to understand this concept, compare the English sentences 'I ate a banana ' with 'I want to eat a banana '. Besides being indefinite in both cases, in the <b>first</b> <b>sentence</b> a banana is specific, because it refers to a specific banana; in the second sentence a banana is non-specific, because it can refer to any banana, not one in particular. Although this semantic difference is not grammaticalized in English, it is in Araki, using re as a marker for non-specific indefinite reference.|$|E

Shooting was the only legal means of execution, though the exact procedure has never been codified. Unlike most other countries, execution did not involve any official ceremony: the convict was often given no warning and taken by surprise in order to eliminate fear, suffering and resistance. Where warning was given, it was usually just a few minutes.|$|E
