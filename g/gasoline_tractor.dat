Here one goes on from task to task, each one {{bigger and more}} venturesome than the last; acre added to acre, a <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor</b> to the horse-plow, another quarter-section broken.

60|$|The talked good-humoredly {{until the}} dew and growing cold drove them in. Next morning Helen got up while {{the sun rose}} from behind a bluff {{on the edge of}} the plain, but when she went out on the veranda she saw the <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor</b> and gang-plow lurch across the rise. This {{indicated}} that Festing had been at work for some time, and she looked thoughtful as she went back into the house.|$|E
60|$|Helen meditatively {{studied her}} husband. Festing had been plowing since sunrise and looked tired. Something {{had gone wrong}} with his <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor,</b> and she knew he had spent {{two or three hours}} finding out the fault. This had annoyed him, because time was {{valuable}} and he was impatient of delay. Helen approved his industry and the stubborn perseverance that led to his overcoming many obstacles, but sometimes thought he took things too hard and exaggerated their importance. Now as he leaned against the balustrade he had the physical grace of a well-trained athlete, but she thought his look was fretful and his mind too much occupied.|$|E

Huber Manufacturing introduced a thresher in 1875, a steam traction engine in 1898, its first motor graders in the 1920s, a primitive hydraulic control in 1926, {{and the first}} Maintainer, a tractor-sized integral motor grader, in 1943. Other Huber products included wheel tractors, agricultural equipment, and three-wheel, tandem and pneumatic rollers.|$|R

Then he had to sell this new vehicle and seems to have done well at this job. In June 1912 LGOC's former bus manufacturing operation was hived off into AEC and Searle is described as [...] "manager of the Daimler Company Limited 'bus and commercial vehicle department" [...] when visiting North America to [...] "inspect the bus transportation system in the large American and Canadian cities and also to attend the trials of agricultural <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors</b> at the Winnipeg Man. exhibition." ...|$|R

60|$|After a {{while they}} struck into a well-beaten track which had been graded where it crossed a muskeg. The rude work, however, had {{suffered}} from frost and rain: the ruts in the hard black soil were deep and there were dangerous holes. To make matters worse, a big <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor,</b> intended to assist in some harvesting operations, had got into difficulties near {{the middle of the}} graded track. It was making an alarming noise and diffusing a pungent odor, while two men thrust bits of board beneath the wheels for it to climb out of the hole on. Prescott's team slackened their pace, jerking their heads and pricking their ears. They were young range horses that had roamed over wide spaces, and were badly broken.|$|E

60|$|In front, {{everything}} was quiet. The pale-green sky was streaked along the horizon by {{a band of}} smoky red, and the gray prairie rolled into the foreground, checkered by clumps of birches and patches of melting snow. In one place, the figures {{of a man and}} horses moved slowly across the fading light; but except for this, the wide landscape was without life and desolate. Festing, however, knew it would not long remain a silent waste. A change was coming with the railroad; in a few years, the wilderness would be covered with wheat; and noisy <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors</b> would displace the plowman's teams. Moreover, a change was coming to him; he felt that he had reached the trail fork and now must choose his path.|$|R
50|$|The {{first known}} European seed drill was {{attributed}} to Camillo Torello and patented by the Venetian Senate in 1566. A seed drill was described in detail by Tadeo Cavalina of Bologna in 1602. In England, the seed drill was further refined by Jethro Tull in 1701 in the Agricultural Revolution. However, seed drills of this and successive types were both expensive and unreliable, as well as fragile. Seed drills would not come into widespread use in Europe until the mid-19th century. Early drills were small enough to be pulled by a single horse, {{and many of these}} remained in use into the 1930s. The availability of steam, and later <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors,</b> however, saw the development of larger and more efficient drills that allowed farmers to seed ever larger tracts in a single day.|$|R

5000|$|In 1904, Case {{introduced}} the first all-steel thresher machine. Case sold their first <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor</b> that year, {{and established a}} continuous presence in most of Europe when the company won the first place in a plowing contest held in the so-called [...] "old continent". Case at this time developed a wide line of products: threshers, binders, graders, water tanks, plows, buggies, and even automobiles.|$|E
50|$|Schloemer was not {{satisfied}} with the current method of plowing the farm fields so went about conceiving, with his son Andrew, a self-powered tractor to improve the situation. The new Schloemer tractor they patented was made with two plows, one on each end of the tractor. The back plow was lowered into the ground when going across the field to plow the dirt over. When the tractor {{reached the end of the}} field the plow was raised by a lever. Then the tractor was lined up into the next row without turning it around. The other plow on the opposite end of the tractor was lowered by a lever and the plowing commenced going back across the field. This procedure continued for plowing the complete field without once turning the tractor around. The Schloemer non-turning <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor</b> was made in 1896, and has been claimed as the first <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor</b> ever made, although John Froelich of Iowa's 1892 machine is also credited with this achievement. The production of Schloemer's tractor was held up because of financial problems.|$|E
5000|$|The Phoenix Manufacturing Company {{produced}} {{a number of}} new products for the lumber milling industry. In 1887, Phoenix introduced a new band-type mill saw, known as the Esplin mill. This was followed by the Emerson bandmill, and later the Phoenix light bandmill, known for producing the [...] "largest cut of perfect sawed lumber for the least outlay". The firm also furnished building parts such as arches, plates, and columns. Many structures in the Eau Claire still feature slim support columns marked with the Phoenix name. The company's largest success was with the Phoenix Log Hauler, a licensed version of a Lombard Steam Log Hauler. Over 100 of these log haulers were produced. Due to greater competition from <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors,</b> particularly the Holt tractor, Phoenix began manufacturing the Phoenix Centipede Truck for agricultural and construction use.|$|R
60|$|He went on, using plain {{words but}} with some force of imagination, to picture the wheat-grower's hopes and struggles; but he did more, for as he talked Helen was {{conscious}} of the romance that underlay the patient effort. She saw the empty, silent land rolling back to the West; the ox-teams slowly breaking the first furrow, and then the big Percheron horses and <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors</b> taking their place. Wooden shacks dotted the white grass, the belts of green wheat widened, wagons, and afterwards automobiles, lurched along the rutted trails. Then the railroad came, brick homestead and windmills rose, and cities sprang up, as it were, in a night. Everything was fluid, there was no permanence; rules and customs altered before they got familiar, a new nation, with new thoughts and aims, was rising from the welter of tense activity.|$|R
5000|$|The Avery {{company made}} many {{traction}} engines, {{such as the}} 1907 steam tractor model. At that time steam was the only form {{of power and the}} tractor resembled a miniature locomotive. In 1909, Avery began manufacturing <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors.</b> They shortly gained a reputation for producing huge tractors, including the very large for its day [...] Avery steam traction engines, weighing 25 ST each. Large tractors were needed across the prairie from North Dakota to Texas to turn the virgin sod, often with roots as thick as a man's thumb, into tillable soil. Even teams of 16 horses were not strong enough to pull gang plows through the dense bunch grasses whose roots grew as deep as 6 ft into the earth. The first small steam traction engines, adapted from the design of stationary engines used to thresh wheat and gin cotton, weren’t strong enough and broke down repeatedly.|$|R
50|$|Schaefer has {{authored}} three books: Farm Tractor Collectibles, (MBI Publishing, in 1998), Oliver Tractors, (MBI Publishing, in 2001), and Classic Oliver Tractors: History, Models, Variations & Specifications 1855-1976, (Voyageur Press, 2009). Additionally, Schaefer {{has provided}} her expertise in other tractor-related books including: A Guide to Hart-Parr, Oliver and White Farm Tractors 1901-1996 by Larry Gay, Oliver Farm Tractors by T. Herbert Morrell, Oliver Photographic History by April Halberstadt and Ultimate American Farm Tractor Data Book Nebraska Test Tractors 1920-1960 by Lorry Dunning.In January 2003, Schaefer was picked {{and approved by}} the Smithsonian Institution to assist with the restoration of the oldest mass-production <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor</b> in existence. The tractor had not been in working condition since 1960, and a small team of experts were chosen to bring the tractor back to life for its 100-year anniversary.In August 2003, Schaefer was an expert witness in Washington, D.C. to defend the Chinese Embassy regarding an international trade commission complaint filed by a US tractor manufacturer. She is an executive board member of the Illinois Rural Heritage Museum and a lifetime honorary member of the American Farm Heritage Museum. She has been the guest speaker at numerous community organizations and national tractor club gatherings. In 2011, Schaefer was honored by the I&I Tractor Club with an award of appreciation for her many contributions.Schaefer regularly travels around the country to visit with former executives, engineers, employees, and farmers who are/were involved with the manufacture or use of farm equipment. She also attends various trade shows, toy shows, and tractor exhibits to share her passion of the farm equipment hobby.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impact and diffusion of the <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractor</b> in American agriculture. A key {{feature of the}} transition from horses to tractors was a long intermediate stage when both modes of power were used on the same farm. This is largely explained in the technical limitations of early tractors. In addition, we explore how rural markets and institutions adjusted to facilitate diffusion. Our simultaneous-equation regression analysis reveals that farm scale and tractor adoption had positive, independent effects on each other. Finally, we analyze diffusion as a capital replacement problem, which reveals that the shift to the new technology came far sooner than has generally been thought. ...|$|E
50|$|Increased {{competition}} {{during the}} early 1900s from the new International Harvester Company led the company to expand its offerings in the implement business, but the production of <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors</b> came to define Deere & Company's operations during the 20th century. In 1912, Deere & Company president William Butterworth (Charles' son-in-law), who had replaced Charles Deere {{after his death in}} 1907, began the company's expansion into the tractor business. Deere & Company briefly experimented with its own tractor models, the most successful of which was the Dain All-Wheel-Drive, but in the end decided to continue its foray into the tractor business by purchasing the Waterloo Gasoline Engine Company in 1918, which manufactured the popular Waterloo Boy tractor at its facilities in Waterloo, Iowa. Deere & Company continued to sell tractors under the Waterloo Boy name until 1923, when the John Deere Model D was introduced. The company continues to manufacture a large percentage of its tractors in Waterloo, Iowa, namely the 7R, 8R, and 9R series.|$|R

2500|$|The Dust Bowl, {{also known}} as the Dirty Thirties, was a period of severe dust storms that greatly damaged the ecology and {{agriculture}} of the American and Canadian prairies during the 1930s; severe drought and a failure to apply dryland farming methods to prevent wind erosion (the Aeolian processes) caused the phenomenon. The drought came in three waves, 1934, 1936, and 1939–1940, but some regions of the high plains experienced drought conditions for as many as eight years. With insufficient understanding of the ecology of the plains, farmers had conducted extensive deep plowing of the virgin topsoil of the Great Plains during the previous decade; this had displaced the native, deep-rooted grasses that normally trapped soil and moisture even during periods of drought and high winds. [...] The rapid mechanization of farm equipment, especially small <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors,</b> and widespread use of the combine harvester contributed to farmers' decisions to convert arid grassland (much of which received no more than 10 inches (250mm) of precipitation per year) to cultivated cropland.|$|R
5000|$|In 1912, {{the entire}} Avery Company plant covered more than twenty-seven acres. The company, {{progressive}} for its time, established a dispensary on site that was staffed five {{hours each day}} by two doctors. It also started its own insurance company about the same time. The main factory building and the associated warehouses covered another {{six and a half}} acres. The sections of the plant were joined by a company-designed trolley system used to transport parts. At the time, it manufactured steam and gasoline traction engines, mounted steel water tanks, self-lift plows, farm wagons, corn planters, traction hauling wagons, traction steam shovels, threshing machinery and all required attachments, riding and walking cultivators, single and double row stalk cutters and <b>gasoline</b> <b>tractors.</b> At its height, it called itself [...] "The Largest Tractor Company in the World" [...] and employed 2,600 men, manufacturing eight different tractors along with motor cultivators and trucks. The company offered a broad line of tractors and engines, ranging from one - row cultivator to a huge [...] tractor.|$|R

500|$|Pliny E. Holt, {{the son of}} Benjamin's half-brother, William Harrison Holt, {{had been}} working with Stockton Wheel Company for the past nine years. In 1906, he was named {{president}} of the newly formed Aurora Engine Company, named after Aurora Street in Stockton where it was located. The new company manufactured gasoline engines to replace the large, heavy steam boilers used to power the earlier Holt <b>tractors.</b> A <b>gasoline</b> engine considerably reduced the overall size and weight of a tractor, produced more power per pound of weight, and reduced the tractor's cost, making it more cost-effective and affordable. Holt's most popular <b>gasoline</b> engine <b>tractor</b> was a Model 75, weighing [...] with a [...] engine. Pliny was also treasurer of another subsidiary, the Houser and Haines Manufacturing Company of Stockton, from 1905–09.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Frohring {{received}} patents for Frohring Cement Mixers, {{a line of}} compact, portable mixers than can be moved out to a field and operated by hand, electric motor, <b>gasoline</b> motor or <b>tractor</b> motor. [...] In 1953, Frohring patented a neurological research device known as a biothesiometer, used to determine a patient’s sensitivity to vibration. Other patents include a formula for hypo-alergic milk, a process of making liquid malted milk, and a method for determining vitamin A deficiency, and a method for extracting carotene.|$|R
50|$|Internal {{combustion}} engines can be configured {{to run on}} many kinds of fuel, including <b>gasoline,</b> kerosene, <b>tractor</b> vaporizing oil (TVO), vegetable oil, diesel fuel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (alcohol), and others. Multifuel engines, such as petrol-paraffin engines, can benefit from an initial vaporization of the fuel when they are running less volatile fuels. For this purpose, a vaporizer (or vaporiser) {{is placed in the}} intake system. The vaporizer uses heat from the exhaust manifold to vaporize the fuel. For example, the original Fordson tractor and various subsequent Fordson models had vaporizers. When Henry Ford & Son Inc designed the original Fordson (1916), the vaporizer was used to provide for kerosene operation. When TVO became common in various countries (including the United Kingdom and Australia) in the 1940s and 1950s, the standard vaporizers on Fordson models were equally useful for TVO. Widespread adoption of diesel engines in tractors made the use of tractor vaporizing oil obsolete.|$|R
500|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, {{there was a}} large number of {{companies}} across the world striving to build a practical horse-drawn combine harvester and other farm equipment. They soon moved on inventing steam-powered farm machinery and, later, designs for crawler-type tractors. More than 100 patents were issued for various crawler designs. Holt began manufacturing horse-drawn combine harvesters in the 1890s and converted to steam-power types around the start of the 20th century. Over the next few years, Benjamin Holt designed and manufactured the first successful crawler-type tractor and designed a <b>gasoline</b> engine (see <b>Tractor</b> design, below.) ...|$|R
