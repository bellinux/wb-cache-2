5|$|Courtship {{begins when}} a male follows a female until he meets her face-to-face.

The pair repeat the process several times, with the male retreating from and then returning to the female until she swims to the bottom, where they copulate. As the male <b>is</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>than</b> the female, he is not dominant. The female stores sperm, {{to be used for}} up to three clutches, in her oviducts; the sperm may remain viable for up to threeyears. A single clutch may have multiple fathers.|$|E
