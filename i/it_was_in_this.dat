5|$|Against Surrey on August 6, King was overpowering again. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> {{match that}} King gave what Barker called his finest {{first-class}} performance ever.

In the second innings, he made 113 not out and then took 3 for 98. Surrey lost the match by 110 runs. Apparently, King was so exhausted after his performance that he fell asleep during a speech by the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone at a banquet after the match.|$|E

Abu Taghlib led the resistance against the Buyids, who, unable to maintain themselves there, evacuated Mosul and reached a new agreement with the Hamdanids. Consequently, Nasir al-Dawla was now increasingly eclipsed by his sons, and was deposed outright and exiled in 967, dying in captivity shortly after.|$|E

5|$|Johnston's best match {{performance}} came in {{the only}} loss in the Third Test at Adelaide.

Exploiting a wet patch at the striker's end, Johnston took 6/62 in the first innings as 22 wickets fell {{on the first day}} in treacherous batting conditions; however he was unable to stop an Australian defeat, taking only 1/50 in the second innings as the tourists reached their target of 233 with six wickets in hand.|$|E

Finally they attempted to find a man named Thomas Smith, living in Benton Township near Raven Creek. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> area that four more people joined the Lincoln Midnight Riders.

5|$|Part of {{the rebellious}} forces held out, however, and their stronghold was the {{virtually}} impregnable Kenilworth Castle.

In August, the king summoned a parliament at Kenilworth, where the siege was ongoing. He commissioned a number of earls, barons and bishops to draft a treaty of reconciliation.|$|E
