Ladd {{revealed}} in a 2013 interview that skateboarding was a prominent aspect of his childhood in Boston: [...] "I would skate my box and flatbar in the warehouse next to my father's auto parts store and then take the train into downtown to skate.

5000|$|In Switzerland, in Bern, I {{lived on}} the Gerechtigkeitsgasse, that is, Justice Street. <b>In</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house,</b> in the street, was the colored statue, holding the scales. Around, crushed kings begging perhaps for a pardon. In the winter, the little lake {{in the middle of}} which the statue stood, in the winter the {{freezing}} water, sometimes brittle with a thin layer of ice. In the spring red geraniums … And the still-medieval street: I lived in the old part of the city. What saved me from the monotony of Bern was living in the Middle Ages, it was waiting for the snow to pass and for the red geraniums to be reflected once again in the water, it was having a son born there, it was writing one of my least liked books, The Besieged City, which, however, people come to like when they read it a second time; my gratitude to that book is enormous: the effort of writing it kept me busy, saved me from the appalling silence of Bern, and when I finished the last chapter I went to the hospital to give birth to the boy.|$|E

Yesterday morning I was too late to walk -to the other stop, so I stood while the lady next door sat in my seat and smiled at me with sarcastic little daggers throughout the fifteen-minute ride. She probably thinks I have no conscience, but I do and I keep telling n:y conscience that this walk early in the morning is good exercise. The North Meridian bus which I ride from town is never crowded at nine o 2 ̆ 7 clock so those who ride it probably give me credit for being very chivalrous...|$|E
40|$|Plum Blossom Warm Gentle Wind Shimmering Stillness is a {{composition}} for solo bass trombone and accompanying ensemble. It is in six movements and is approximately 12 minutes long. The piece {{is dedicated to}} my grandfathers Benjamin A. Levis, and Harbert S. Gregory, who have passed away in recent years. I initially began work on concepts for the composition while studying with Professor John Thow, and then with Professor Jorge Liderman, but put it away after their untimely passing. Movement four is dedicated to both of them. The composition was written for my good friend and unparalleled bass trombonist, Marc Bolin. The title reflects my interest in haiku, {{and the possibility of}} containing in a brief statement, a moment of total clarity and harmony. While reflecting on Professor Thow's passing, sitting on my front porch, watching the blooming plum tree <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> <b>house</b> shake and stir ever so gently when the wind would pick up, I experienced one of these moments of deep quietude. Even as the title is not a haiku in its traditional form, it contains a moment for me where something brief and subtle can have a sudden impact and lasting resonance. Even though the composition is inspired by this moment, it is not an impressionistic, sonic image of the natural world. Rather, it is a metaphor for the complex relationships that make up our human experience, the impact those relationships have on us, and the lasting effects and reverberations they create. The work employs a myriad of extended techniques, engendering layers of timbral commonality. This allows the ensemble to fuse into blended "meta-instruments" and magnify the sonic landscape of the bass trombone. The composition is influenced by my interest in the sometimes antagonistic aims of post-spectral harmony and orchestration, self-similarity modeling of the new complexity school, and large-scale architecture in improvisation. The instrumentation for Plum Blossom Warm Gentle Wind Shimmering Stillness is bass trombone, four percussionists, piano, two violins, viola, violoncello, and contrabass...|$|E
