40|$|This study {{involved}} experimental investigation onto the flexural behaviour of glue-laminated fibre composite sandwich beams {{with a view}} of using this material for structural beams. Composite sandwich beams with 1, 2, 3, and 4 composite sandwich panels glued together were subjected to 4 -point static bending test in the <b>flatwise</b> and edgewise positions to evaluate their stiffness and strength properties. The results showed that the composite sandwich beams in the edgewise position failed with 25 % higher bending strength but have 7 % lower bending stiffness than beams in the <b>flatwise</b> position. The results however indicated that the bending stiffness of <b>flatwise</b> specimens converges to that of the edgewise specimens with increasing laminations. More importantly, the specimens in the edgewise position failed with greater ductility due to progressive failure of the fibre composite skins while the specimens in the <b>flatwise</b> position failed in a brittle manner due to debonding between the skin and core. Wrapping the glue-laminated sandwich beams with one layer of tri-axial glass fibres did not prove to be effective.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to determine experimentally the flexural behaviour of laminated composite sandwich beams based on orientation {{and the number of}} laminations. The failure modes and loads were numerically modelled and predicted analytically. The sandwich beams were fabricated using a new generation of sandwich composite with biaxial glass fibre/resin skin and an innovative phenolic based core material. The laminated beams were subjected to 4 -point static bending tests to determine the strength and failure mechanisms. The beams tested consist of one to four laminates in the <b>flatwise</b> and edgewise orientation. Strains to failure in the face sheets were measured through the use strain gauges and beam deflections were recorded for each specimen. The results of the experimental investigation demonstrated that the laminated sections tested in the edgewise orientation failed at a higher load than those in the <b>flatwise</b> orientation. The <b>flatwise</b> specimens had a brittle type failure. This was primarily due to the compressive failure of the skin followed by debonding between the skin and the core. The vertical skins in the edgewise orientation caused a difference in the failure mode and ultimately facilitated the increase in ultimate strength. The vertical skins prevented the tension cracks in the core from propagating and caused ductile type failure mode through the progressive failure of the skins. The analytical predictions from the constituent material data confirmed the experimental results. The analytical investigation conducted predicted the load deflection behaviour and initial failure loads. The results from the linear numerical modelling are in agreement with those observed in the experimental data. The experimental data established that for a higher number of laminations the beam sections in the edgewise orientation provides an optimal alternative to the <b>flatwise</b> orientation. It was found that the edgewise orientation provides a higher ultimate strength, ductile type failure and comparable stiffness to the <b>flatwise</b> orientation. The results indicated a high potential for the use of laminated sandwich beams as structural elements in both the <b>flatwise</b> and edgewise orientation...|$|E
40|$|The shear {{behaviour}} {{of structural}} sandwich beams made by gluing together fibre composite sandwich panels in the <b>flatwise</b> {{and in the}} edgewise positions was investigated {{with a view of}} using this material for construction and building applications. The effect of the number and orientation of sandwich laminations on the shear strength and failure behaviour of glued sandwich beams is examined using an asymmetrical beam shear test. The results showed that the behaviour of the glued sandwich beams in the <b>flatwise</b> position is governed by the shear strength of the core while in the edgewise position by the shear strength of the skin. In the edgewise position, the skin carries almost 60 % of the load but only 20 % in the <b>flatwise</b> position. With increasing sandwich laminations, the glued sandwich beams in the edgewise position achieved over 200 % shear strength than beams in the <b>flatwise</b> position.

40|$|A new {{generation}} composite sandwich {{made up of}} glass fibre reinforced polymer skins and lightweight but high strength core material has been developed in Australia. Experimental investigation was conducted to determine the behaviour of this composite sandwich {{with a view of}} using this material for structural beam. As these sandwiches are produced in limited thicknesses, the structural beam section could be attained by gluing a number of sandwiches in the <b>flatwise</b> (horizontal) or edgewise (vertical) positions. Characterisation of the behaviour of individual sandwiches as well as beams with 2, 3 and 4 composite sandwiches glued together was conducted.

However, it failed at a 20 % higher load with a different failure mode. The specimens in the edgewise position failed with greater ductility due to progressive failure of the fibre composite skins while the specimens in the <b>flatwise</b> position failed in a brittle manner due to core shear failure followed by delamination between the skin and the core. These initial results are very encouraging. With further investigation, the development of structural beams from these fibre composite sandwiches could be realised...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Three-dimensional (3 -D) {{spacer fabric}} {{composite}} {{is a novel}} lightweight sandwich structure, the reinforcement of which is integrally woven with two facesheets connected by continuous fibers (named piles) in the core. Usually the 3 -D spacer fabric composite without extra reinforcement is called mono-spacer fabric composite, which provides outstanding facesheet / core debonding resistance. However, its mechanical properties cannot meet the demand of structure application because of the thin facesheet and low load-bearing capacity of high piles. Hence, two reinforcement methods were developed by laminating additional weaves at the facesheet and filling foam materials in the core to strengthen the facesheet and piles, respectively. This paper aims to investigate the influences of reinforcement methods on the mechanical behaviors and damage modes of 3 -D spacer fabric composites under <b>flatwise</b> compressive, shear, edgewise compressive and three-point bending loads, by comparing with mono-spacer fabric composites. The results indicate that additional weaves reinforcement can enhance edgewise compressive and flexural properties effectively. Foam filling {{is one of the}} best options to improve the <b>flatwise</b> compressive and shear properties, and especially, there are synergistic effects between piles and foam under <b>flatwise</b> compressive load. Besides, the failure modes of reinforced and mono-spacer fabric composites are different...|$|E

The compositions were manufactured in six different combinations of five veneers of 3. 2 mm thickness, glued with phenol-formaldehyde, resulting in treatments composed of wood of the same species or with a combination of two wood types. The evaluation of the proposed arrangements was performed under the characterization of physical properties (moisture content and density) and mechanical properties (modulus of elasticity – MOE and modulus of rupture – MOR) verified in <b>flatwise</b> and edgewise static bending tests. The results obtained indicated that, in most situations, the different positions of the veneers with higher density (in the outer, intermediate and inner layers) influenced the mechanical properties of the panels. The influence detected was varied for MOE and MOR, especially when comparing the <b>flatwise</b> and edgewise test values. In certain positions, on the layers of the LVL compositions, the presence of eucalypt veneers resulted in stiffness and strength increases. However, the treatments formed by interposed veneers of eucalypt and pine demonstrated interesting performances for structural use, in either <b>flatwise</b> or edgewise position, once they present values of MOE and MOR that allow to distinguish them as 1 st class, according to the North American standard APA/EWS PRL– 501 (2001) ...|$|E

The effects of wrapping the glulam sandwich beams with one-layer of tri-axial glass fibres on the flexural behaviour were also examined. The glulam sandwich beams with edgewise laminations showed better structural performance compared to the beams with <b>flatwise</b> laminations due to the introduction of the vertical fibre composite skins. The glulam beams with edgewise sandwich laminations failed with 25 % higher bending strength and almost similar bending stiffness than beams with <b>flatwise</b> laminations. The glulam sandwich beams with fibre wraps behaved slightly stiffer compared to the sandwich beams without wraps. In addition, the presence of fibre wraps prevented the immediate failure of the glulam beams which resulted in a higher strength and more ductile failure behaviour. ...|$|E

The skins of the composite sandwich are made up of tri-axis E-glass fibres infused with epoxy resin and the core material of fly ash with low density polystyrene beads. Structural composite sandwich with span lengths of 200, 400 and 800 mm was tested until final failure.

However, the specimen tested in the edgewise position failed at a higher load and exhibited a higher flexural stiffness. The specimens tested in the <b>flatwise</b> position failed due to core shear failure followed by delamination between the skin and the core.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} parametric variation in individual rotor/wing design variables on whirl flutter stability improvements of a soft in-plane tiltrotor. This {{is followed by the}} use of formal gradient-based design optimization. The simulations are based on a full-scale soft in-plane Boeing model 222 rotor on a semispan wing. For this baseline configuration, the <b>flatwise</b> flexibility and chordwise flexibility are both outboard of the pitch bearing and produce destabilizing pitch-flap and pitch-lag couplings. The most influential rotor parameter in improving flutter stability characteristics is the distribution of <b>flatwise</b> flexibility vis-à-vis the pitch bearing, and large improvements are observed when <b>flatwise</b> flexibility is moved inboard. However, this can result in a large increase in lag frequency and turn the design into a stiff in-plane configuration. Using frequency constraints during optimization of rotor parameters and carefully selecting the airspeed range over which optimization is conducted results in improvement in subcritical wing mode damping and increase in critical flutter speed. Other rotor parameters changes that have some benefit are reduction in overall chordwise stiffness, positive increase in pitch-flap and pitch-lag coupling, and increase in control system stiffness. Wing design parameters are unable to increase the critical flutter speed but can improve the subcritical damping, primarily through an increase in wing torsion frequency and a simultaneous reduction in wing beam mode frequency. Optimization using a combination of rotor/wing design parameters yields a 35 kt increase in whirl flutter speed (from 390 to 425 kt) and an increase in subcritical damping from less than 1 % t...|$|E

Hardwood timber for railway sleepers is becoming more expensive, less available and of inferior quality compared to the timber previously available. This problem is accentuated in railway turnouts where larger, longer, stronger and more expensive timber is required. Research has therefore focused on the possibility of fibre composites replacing timber as the many issues related to the currently used sleeper materials could be simulated using this material.
