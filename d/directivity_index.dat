Total signal duration was 1000 ms, including a 200 ms rise time and 300 ms fall time. The harbor porpoise was trained {{to participate in a}} psychophysical test and stationed itself horizontally in a specific direction {{in the center of a}} 16 -m-diameter circle consisting of 16 equally-spaced underwater transducers. The animal's head and the transducers were in the same horizontal plane, 1. 5 m below the water surface. The go/no-go response paradigm was used; the animal left the listening station when it heard a sound signal. The method of constants was applied. For each transducer the 50 % detection threshold amplitude was determined in 16 trials per amplitude, for each of the three frequencies. The beam patterns were not symmetrical with respect to the midline of the animal's body, but had a deflection of 3 - 7 ° to the right. The receiving beam pattern narrowed with increasing frequency. Assuming that the pattern is rotation-symmetrical according to an average of the horizontal beam pattern halves, the receiving <b>directivity</b> <b>indices</b> are 4. 3 at 16 kHz, 6. 0 at 64 kHz, and 11. 7 dB at 100 kHz. The receiving <b>directivity</b> <b>indices</b> of the porpoise were lower than those measured for bottlenose dolphins. This means that harbor porpoises have wider receiving beam patterns than bottlenose dolphins for the same frequencies.

Take off, landing or pass by operations can be modeled by INM, {{but it does not}} consider aircrafts taxiing, which, in some cases, can be important to accurately evaluate and reduce airports' noise assessment. Aircraft taxiing noise emission can be predicted using other prediction tools based on standards that describe sound attenuation during propagation outdoors. But these tools require data inputs that are not known: directivity and sound power levels emitted by aircraft during taxiing. This paper describes methods used to calculate <b>directivity</b> <b>indexes</b> and sound power levels, based on field measurements made in Madrid-Barajas Airport (Spain).

The acoustic performance of coannular jets {{is compared to}} the performance of a hypothetical single jet with the same total mass flow, thrust, and total enthalpy flow as the coannular jet.

The maximum sound power reduction is found to be about 4 decibels. <b>Directivity</b> <b>indices</b> and a special set of spectral curves were developed to describe the characteristic double peak spectra of coannular jet noise.

The instrumental recordings used in this paper are taken in an anechoic chamber using either a 5, 13, or 32 multichannel setup. From the values of maximum <b>Directivity</b> <b>Index</b> evaluated using the windowing technique, quantifiers including Average Maximum <b>Directivity</b> <b>Index,</b> Average Change in Maximum <b>Directivity</b> <b>Index,</b> Location Change Ratio, Dominance Ratio, and Dominating Location are calculated.

40|$|The <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> {{which is}} {{currently}} used for characterizing the directional properties of transducers, refers primarily {{to their ability to}} radiate sound power. When transducers are used in echo ranging, the <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> is, theoretically at least, of minor interest. Of greater interest is the ability of the transducer to discriminate between the echo from a target at which it is pointed, and the reverberation returned to it from this and other directions. This discrimination is measured by other quantities, called reverberation indices. One of these concerns volume, the other surface or bottom reverberation. The purpose of the present work was to study the relations between the three indices. Conclusions drawn from a study of typical projector patterns are as follows: 1. The volume reverberation index and the surface reverberation index of a projector are linearly related to the <b>directivity</b> <b>index,</b> provided that the directivity pattern is reasonably similar to that of a circular piston in an infinite baffle. This condition is found in the echo-ranging projectors studied when they are operated at 24 kc without domes. However, the <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> does not provide a reliable measure of the reverberation indices when the projector pattern has abnormally strong side lobes. 2. Neither projector housing studied has appreciable effect on reverberation indices. 3. The echo: reverberation ratio depends almost entirely on the shape of the main lobe of the composite directivity pattern between zero and - 6 db. As a result, the reverberation indices of a transceiver can be determined by measuring the width of its directivity pattern at - 6 db. Half of this angle will be termed the half-width of the pattern. 4. Since the reverberation indices can be so readily calculated from the half-width, it is recommended that this quantity be specified in describing a transducer. The <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> usually, but not always, can be calculated from the half-width to within 3 db...|$|E

40|$|The <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> is a {{parameter}} that {{is commonly}} used to characterize the performance of directional hearing aids, and is determined from the measured directional response. Since this response is different for a hearing aid worn on a person as compared to when {{it is in a}} free field, <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> measurements of hearing aids are usually done under simulated real-ear conditions. Details are provided regarding the NIST system for measuring the hearing aid <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> under these conditions and how this system is used to implement a standardized procedure for performing such measurements.

This contribution addresses the problem of choosing between cylindrical and circular piston transducers by comparing {{the performance of the}} two according to the principle that the acoustically active areas be equal. Computations are performed with the actual dimensions of six fabricated cylindrical transducers, whose beam patterns have been measured by the manufacturer at a total of eleven frequencies spanning the range 27 - 710 kHz. Nominal power levels assigned to the cylindrical transducers are also used for both transducer types. Comparison of theoretically computed beam patterns with measurement gives confidence in the radiation model, which is used to compute the <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> and on-axis sensitivity loss due to curvature of the cylindrical transducers, referred to as the curvature loss. Under identical conditions of excitation, isotropic ambient noise, and detection threshold of 20 dB, the active sonar equation is exercised to estimate the maximum detection range of both single targets and multiple targets distributed throughout the sampling volume. In every single case, the performance of the equal-area circular piston is superior to that of the corresponding cylindrical transducer. This is directly attributable to differences in <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> and curvature loss. Other, pragmatic considerations argue for the choice of the circular piston transducer over the cylindrical transducer. Three problems requiring future treatment are identified...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} a new {{adaptive}} scheme in which an optimal distance-based update threshold is selected {{not only as a}} function of the call-to-mobility ratio, but also as a transitional <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> #; a new parameter introduced to give some measures of the mobile's traveling patterns. It is assumed that when # > 1, the mobile has a greater tendency of roaming "outwards" and hence a higher probability of transition to the next ring during each movement. As a result, the defined threshold will be reached sooner incurring more update costs. A corresponding sectional paging scheme is therefore proposed to predict mobile's likelihood of residency utilizing the information given by the estimated #. Provided that the prediction of location probability is reliable, a movement pattern with increasing directivity will justify having increased update thresholds without incurring additional paging costs. As far as the mobility characteristics are concerned, the introduction of the <b>directivity</b> <b>index</b> has successfully demonstrated its ability to make optimum decisions on a distance-based update threshold. Its advantage becomes even more significant when the theoretically determined "ideal" optimal threshold is not obtainable due to certain restrictions imposed by the network during times of high system loading.
