40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} measurements of intraoperative left ventricular (LV) area by transoesophageal echocardiography against simultaneous measurements of LV volume by conductance catheter (CC) in cardiac surgical patients with normal systolic LV function. <b>Echo</b> <b>area</b> was compared with CC volume during steady state and during acute changes of pre‐ and afterload by partial clamping of the inferior vena cava and the ascending aorta in eight patients scheduled for coronary artery bypass grafting. At steady state, Bland-Altman analysis of 32 recordings revealed a bias (sd) of 0. 6 % (2. 5 %) between <b>echo</b> <b>area</b> and CC volume, related to the initial values of end‐diastolic area (100 % area) and volume (100 % volume), respectively. During loading interventions, bias between the two methods, as assessed by 112 measurement sequences, was 0. 5 % (3. 7 %) during aortic occlusion and - 3. 9 % (4. 4 %) during cava occlusion at end‐systole (P< 0. 0001); at end‐diastole, this bias was 1. 3 % (4 %) during aortic occlusion and 0. 2 % (5. 7 %) during cava occlusion (P< 0. 0001). Intraoperative area measurements with transoesophageal echocardiography in cardiac surgical patients with normal systolic LV function show good correlation with CC volume measurements under steady‐state conditions.

40|$|Abstract: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Radar (PR) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis {{data are}} used to {{investigate}} the relation of convective precipitation systems to the topography of South America. Three types of convective radar echo structures are defined: Deep convective cores (convective 40 dBZ echo ≥ 10 km in height), wide convective cores (convective 40 dBZ <b>echo</b> <b>area</b> ≥ 1000 km) and broad stratiform regions (stratiform <b>echo</b> <b>area</b> ≥ 50, 000 km). Their geographic distribution, diurnal cycles, and relation to the precipitation pattern are studied to gain insight into the mechanisms leading to convection {{in the vicinity of}} the Andes. Diurnal heating and capping of the low-level moist flow by dry air flowing over the Andes affects the evening formation of deep and wide convective cores. Nocturnal downslope flow influences the formation of wide convective cores in the early morning. Broad stratiform regions appear to be a later stage of mesoscale system development and their locations coincide with the areas of maximum rainfall.

40|$|Radar {{observations}} {{have been}} analyzed to determine characteristics of convection over the oceanic region around Kwajalein {{in the tropical}} western Pacific. Generally, the <b>echo</b> <b>areas,</b> heights, and durations exhibited lognormal distributions. Heights were greater under conditions of higher midtropospheric hu-midity and correlated with <b>echo</b> <b>area,</b> with {{a wide spread of}} values. Mergers and splits often truncated echo lifetimes. The most surprising result was the distribution of orientation angles of echo lines, which statistically verify the shear-parallel and shear-normal modes of convective line organization seen elsewhere over tropical oceans. The two modes typically coexisted within the area of radar coverage, indicating a potential difficulty in predicting line orientation in terms of large-scale variables. The largest members of the echo population were mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), which had large stratiform components. They occurred in environments of increased humidity and higher midlevel buoyancy associated with westward-propagating synoptic-scale disturbances. MCSs moved with the easterlies in low to midlevels and exhibited the jump updraft, overturning updraft, and subsiding midlevel inflow charac-teristic of tropical oceanic MCSs. The Kwajalein Experiment (KWAJEX) radar echo population resembles that of the eastern tropical Atlantic in terms of the shapes of the distributions of area, height, and lifetime, the prevalence of echo mergers and splits, and the tendency to form shear-parallel and shear-normal lines. These characteristics appear to be endemic to oceanic convective populations. Large-scale conditions appear to modulate these basic population characteristics rather than qualitatively alter them. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an original method for analyzing, in an unsupervised way, images supplied by high resolution sonar. We aim at segmenting the sonar image into {{three kinds of}} regions: <b>echo</b> <b>areas</b> (due to {{the reflection of the}} acoustic wave on the object), shadow areas (corresponding to a lack of acoustic reverberation behind an object lying on the sea-bed), and sea-bottom reverberation areas. This unsupervised method estimates the parameters of noise distributions, modeled by a Weibull probability density function (PDF), and the label field parameters, modeled by a Markov random field (MRF). For the estimation step, we adopt a maximum likelihood technique for the noise model parameters and a least-squares method to estimate the MRF prior model. Then, in order to obtain an accurate segmentation map, we have designed a two-step process that finds the shadow and the echo regions separately, using the previously estimated parameters. First, we introduce a scale-causal and spatial model called SCM (scale causal multigrid), based on a multigrid energy minimization strategy, to find the shadow class. Second, we propose a MRF monoscale model using a priori information (at different level of knowledge) based on physical properties of each region, which allows us to distinguish <b>echo</b> <b>areas</b> from seabottom reverberation. This technique has been successfully applied to real sonar images and is compatible with automatic processing of massive amounts of data. c ○ 1999 Academic Press Key Words: sonar imagery; unsupervised segmentation; MRF hierarchical model; Weibull law; noise model estimation...|$|R

Because of the nonlinearity between Z and rain rate R, Ze gives a biased estimator of R whenever the reflectivity field is nonuniform.
