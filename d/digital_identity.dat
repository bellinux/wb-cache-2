The summit brought together over 400 people to discuss how to provide <b>digital</b> <b>identity</b> to all, a defined Sustainable Development Goal including to 1.5bn people living without any form of recognized identification. Experts in blockchain and other cryptographic technology joined with representatives of technical standards bodies to identify how technology and other private sector expertise could achieve the goal.|$|E
25|$|XRIs are a {{new form}} of Internet {{identifier}} designed specifically for cross-domain <b>digital</b> <b>identity.</b> For example, XRIs come in two forms—i-names and i-numbers—that are usually registered simultaneously as synonyms. I-names are reassignable (like domain names), while i-numbers are never reassigned. When an XRI i-name is used as an OpenID identifier, it is immediately resolved to the synonymous i-number (the CanonicalID element of the XRDS document). This i-number is the OpenID identifier stored by the relying party. In this way, both the user and the relying party are protected from the end-user's OpenID identity ever being taken over by another party as can happen with a URL based on a reassignable DNS name.|$|E

25|$|On January 31, 2007, Symantec {{announced}} {{support for}} OpenID in its Identity Initiative products and services. A week later, on February 6 Microsoft made a joint announcement with JanRain, Sxip, and VeriSign to collaborate on interoperability between OpenID and Microsoft's Windows CardSpace <b>digital</b> <b>identity</b> platform, with particular focus on developing a phishing-resistant authentication solution for OpenID. As {{part of the}} collaboration, Microsoft pledged to support OpenID in its future identity server products and JanRain, Sxip, and VeriSign pledged to add support for Microsoft's Information Card profile to their future identity solutions. In mid-February, AOL announced that an experimental OpenID provider service was functional for all AOL and AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) accounts.|$|E

2500|$|In December, {{developers}} at Sxip Identity began {{discussions with}} the OpenID/Yadis community after announcing {{a shift in the}} development of version 2.0 of its Simple Extensible Identity Protocol (SXIP) to URL-based identities like LID and OpenID. In March 2006, JanRain developed a Simple Registration (SREG) extension for OpenID enabling primitive profile-exchange and in April submitted a proposal to formalize extensions to OpenID. The same month, work had also begun on incorporating full XRI support into OpenID. Around early May, key OpenID developer David Recordon left Six Apart, joining VeriSign to focus more on <b>digital</b> <b>identity</b> and guidance for the OpenID spec. By early June, the major differences between the SXIP 2.0 and OpenID projects were resolved with the agreement to support multiple personas in OpenID by submission of an identity provider URL rather than a full identity URL. With this, as well as the addition of extensions and XRI support underway, OpenID was evolving into a full-fledged <b>digital</b> <b>identity</b> framework, with Recordon proclaiming [...] "We see OpenID as being an umbrella for the framework that encompasses the layers for identifiers, discovery, authentication and a messaging services layer that sits atop and this entire thing has sort of been dubbed 'OpenID 2.0'. [...] " [...] In late July, Sxip began to merge its <b>Digital</b> <b>Identity</b> Exchange (DIX) protocol into OpenID, submitting initial drafts of the OpenID Attribute Exchange (AX) extension in August. Late in 2006, a ZDNet opinion piece made the case for OpenID to users, web site operators and entrepreneurs.|$|E

The proposed trust management architecture extends the existing identity metasystems by introducing computing components for carrying out typical trust management tasks associated with <b>digital</b> <b>identities.</b> The computing components in proposed architecture provide intelligent services for these tasks.

The paper present the review on <b>digital</b> <b>identities</b> which is to be handled by various Identity Management System (IDMs). The paper first provide the definition of <b>Digital</b> <b>Identities</b> and their management. Then these <b>digital</b> <b>identities</b> are embedded in a particular model which is called conceptual model of identity management. Then there is a brief review on various Identity Management system and their advantages and disadvantages as proposed by different authors but our focus is on emerging technology i. e.

2500|$|The {{original}} OpenID authentication {{protocol was}} developed in May 2005 by Brad Fitzpatrick, creator of popular community website LiveJournal, while working at Six Apart. Initially referred to as Yadis (an acronym for [...] "Yet another distributed identity system"), it was named OpenID after the openid.net domain name was given to Six Apart to use for the project. OpenID support was soon implemented on LiveJournal and fellow LiveJournal engine community DeadJournal for blog post comments and quickly gained attention in the <b>digital</b> <b>identity</b> community. Web developer JanRain was an early supporter of OpenID, providing OpenID software libraries and expanding its business around OpenID-based services.|$|E

The whole effort was officially coordinated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency that commentators such as journalists David Perera and Sean Gallagher have speculated was ill-suited to that task. Social activist and technologist Clay Johnson later said {{that the federal government}} had issues come up given that it [...] "leans towards a write-down-all-the-requirements-then-build-to-those-requirements type of methodology" [...] not well suited to current IT especially when government contractors are focused on maximizing profits.|$|E

Furthermore, AIWL keeps track {{of the features of}} login pages (e. g., IP addresses, document object model (DOM) paths of input widgets) in the individual white-list.
