5|$|Forza Motorsport 4 is {{a racing}} video game, {{and the fourth}} in the Forza Motorsport series. Like Sony's Gran Turismo franchise, Forza games are racing simulations; heavy <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> making the cars drive and look as {{realistic}} as possible. Races are conducted on closed circuit tracks. 500 cars are featured in the core game experience, ranging from city cars to race cars.|$|E
5|$|The infrageneric {{classification}} of the fungus is unclear, and {{depends on what}} taxonomic characters are deemed most important. According to Takahashi, the mushroom's violet pigment, the inamyloid (not staining when treated with Melzer's reagent) hymenophoral tissue (hymenium-bearing tissue), and the smooth hyphae of the outer layer of stem suggest a placement in the section Adonideae (Fr.) Quel., {{as defined by the}} Dutch Mycena specialist Maas Geesteranus. However, if greater taxonomic <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> the weakly amyloid basidiospores, it would be more appropriate in the section Fragilipedes (Fr.) Quél.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips. In addition, <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E

Intuitive types prefer a learning atmosphere in which an <b>emphasis</b> <b>is</b> <b>placed</b> <b>on</b> meaning and associations. Insight is valued higher than careful observation, and pattern recognition occurs naturally for intuitive types.|$|E
