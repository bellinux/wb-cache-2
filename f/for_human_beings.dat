5|$|From {{this model}} of Kantian ethics, O'Neill begins to develop a theory of justice. She argues that the {{rejection}} of certain principles, such as deception and coercion, provides {{a starting point for}} basic conceptions of justice, which she argues are more determinate <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> that the more abstract principles of equality or liberty. Nevertheless, she concedes that these principles may seem to be excessively demanding: there are many actions and institutions that do rely on non-universalisable principles, such as injury.|$|E

In total, Rishabhanatha {{is said to}} have taught seventy-two sciences to men, and sixty-four to women. According to Paul Dundas, Rishabhanatha in Jain mythology is thus not merely a spiritual teacher but one who founded knowledge in its various forms and a form of culture hero for the current cosmological cycle.|$|E
5|$|The {{wildebeest}} {{benefit the}} ecosystem by increasing soil fertility with their excreta. They are economically important <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> {{as they are}} a major tourist attraction. They also provide important products like leather to humans. The wildebeest, however, can also {{have a negative impact}} on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E

25|$|Within {{the context}} of Spinoza's {{philosophical}} system, the PSR can be understood to unify causation and explanation. What {{this means is that}} for Spinoza, questions regarding the reason why a given phenomenon {{is the way it is}} (or exists) are always answerable, and are always answerable in terms of the relevant cause(s). This constitutes a rejection of teleological, or final causation, except possibly in a more restricted sense <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> Given this, Spinoza's views regarding causality and modality begin to make much more sense.|$|E
25|$|An unusual species, Turritopsis dohrnii, {{formerly}} {{classified as}} T. nutricula, might be effectively immortal {{because of its}} ability under certain circumstances to transform from medusa back to the polyp stage, thereby escaping the death that typically awaits medusae post-reproduction if they have not otherwise been eaten by some other ocean organism. So far this reversal has been observed only in the laboratory. At least one professor at the Seto Marine Biological Laboratory at Kyoto University in Japan has concluded {{that there are three}} species of jellyfish that are immortal, and says their immortality may hold the key to immortality <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> as he says that genetically they are not that much different from humans.|$|E

The rooftop community, effectively a slum neighborhood, is symbolic of the urbanization of Egypt and of the burgeoning population growth in its large cities in recent decades, especially among the poor and working classes.|$|E

For the most part, however, the {{philosophy of}} healthcare is best approached as an indelible component of human social structures. That is, the societal institution of healthcare {{can be seen as a}} necessary phenomenon of human civilization whereby an individual continually seeks to improve, mend, and alter the overall nature and quality of their life. This perennial concern is especially prominent in modern political liberalism, wherein health has been understood as the foundational good necessary for public life.|$|E
25|$|Once befriended, kappa may perform {{any number}} of tasks <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> such as helping farmers irrigate their land. Sometimes, they bring fresh fish, which is {{regarded}} as a mark of good fortune for the family that receives it. They are also highly knowledgeable about medicine, and legend states that they taught the art of bone setting to human beings. Due to these benevolent aspects, some shrines are dedicated to the worship of particularly helpful kappa. There were also festivals meant to placate the kappa in order to obtain a good harvest, some of which still take place today. These festivals generally took place during the two equinoxes of the year, when the kappa are said to travel from the rivers to the mountains and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|According to Ibn Arabi, Islam is {{the best}} {{religion}} because of Muhammad. Ibn Arabi regards that the first entity that was brought into existence is the reality or essence of Muhammad (al-ḥaqīqa al-Muhammadiyya). Ibn Arabi regards Muhammad as the supreme human being and master of all creatures. Muhammad is therefore the primary role-model <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> to aspire to emulate. Ibn Arabi believes that God's attributes and names are manifested {{in this world and}} that the most complete and perfect display of these divine attributes and names are seen in Muhammad. Ibn Arabi believes that one may see God in the mirror of Muhammad, meaning that the divine attributes of God are manifested through Muhammad. Ibn Arabi maintains that Muhammad {{is the best}} proof of God and by knowing Muhammad one knows God. Ibn Arabi also maintains that Muhammad is the master of all of humanity in both this world and the afterlife. In this view, Islam is the best religion, because Muhammad is Islam.|$|E

25|$|Madilog {{introduced}} {{a way of}} thinking of evidence and fact in a way that fit into Indonesian demographics and culture, in line with Indonesian thinking on fundamentals. Evidence is fact and fact is founded on scientific evidence. There are two main ways of thinking in Western philosophy. The first is idea (mind), unity of thinking, and sense. The second is matter as tangible reality, objective in nature as existence. Those two concepts were combined in the same way of thinking <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings,</b> who are the subject living things. In Madilog, the main field is evidence. Although evidence can't be described rationally, scientifically—as to what, why, and how—evidence should be considered as a true way of thinking, the consequence of not thinking evidentially being logical fallacies and myth-making. This is the focus of the epistemology of Madilog, concerning truth, the validity of science, and the correlation of human knowledge to life. The epistemology is divided into three parts: definition, testing, and mathematical thinking.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is inside the room manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings</b> to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E
25|$|Homelessness is the {{condition}} of people without a permanent dwelling, such as a house or apartment. People who are homeless are most often unable to acquire and maintain regular, safe, secure and adequate housing. The legal definition of homeless varies from country to country, or among different jurisdictions in the same country or region. The term homeless may also include people whose primary night-time residence is in a homeless shelter, a domestic violence shelter, long-term residence in a motel, a vehicle, squatting, cardboard boxes, a tent city, tarpaulins, shanty town structures made of discarded building materials or other ad hoc housing situations. According to the UK homelessness charity Crisis, a home {{is not just a}} physical space: it also provides roots, identity, security, a sense of belonging and a place of emotional wellbeing. American government homeless enumeration studies also include people who sleep in a public or private place not designed for use as a regular sleeping accommodation <b>for</b> <b>human</b> <b>beings.</b> There are a number of organizations who provide help for the homeless.|$|E
