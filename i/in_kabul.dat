Hassan was actually Baba's son and Amir's half-brother. Finally, he tells Amir that the reason he called Amir to Pakistan was to rescue Sohrab, Hassan's son, from an orphanage <b>in</b> <b>Kabul.</b>|$|E

5|$|Under Mohammad Daoud Khan's prime ministership, {{suppression}} of radicals was common. However, {{because of his}} language skills, Taraki {{was sent to the}} Afghan Embassy in the United States in 1952. Within several months Taraki began denouncing the Afghan government under King Zahir Shah and accused it of being autocratic and dictatorial. His denunciation of the Afghan government earned him much publicity in the United States. It also attracted unfavorable attention from authorities back home, who relieved him of his post and ordered him repatriated but stopped short of placing him under arrest. After a short period of unemployment Taraki started working for the United States Overseas Mission <b>in</b> <b>Kabul</b> as an interpreter. He quit that job in 1958 and established his own translation company, the Noor Translation Bureau. Four years later, he started working for the U.S. Embassy <b>in</b> <b>Kabul,</b> but quit in 1963 to focus on the establishment of the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), a communist political party.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the initial}} success in driving the Taliban from power <b>in</b> <b>Kabul,</b> by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, {{amassing}} new funds and recruits. The 2005 failure of Operation Red Wings {{showed that the}} Taliban had returned. In 2006, the Taliban insurgency appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as Operation Mountain Thrust attaining limited success. As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.|$|E
5|$|And the Mountains Echoed is {{the third}} novel by Afghan-American author Khaled Hosseini. Published in 2013 by Riverhead Books, it {{deviates}} from Hosseini's style {{in his first two}} works through his choice to avoid focusing on any one character. Rather, the book is written similarly to a collection of short stories, with each of the nine chapters being told {{from the perspective of a}} different character. The book's foundation is built on the relationship between ten-year-old Abdullah and his three-year-old sister Pari and their father's decision to sell her to a childless couple <b>in</b> <b>Kabul,</b> an event that ties the various narratives together.|$|E
5|$|In {{supporting}} the war effort, India was left vulnerable to hostile action from Afghanistan. A Turco-German mission arrived <b>in</b> <b>Kabul</b> in October 1915, with obvious strategic purpose. Habibullah Khan abided by his treaty obligations and maintained Afghanistan's neutrality, {{in the face}} of internal opposition from factions keen to side with the Ottoman Sultan. Despite this, localised actions along the frontier still took place and included Operations in the Tochi (1914–15), Operations against the Mohmands, Bunerwals and Swatis (1915), Kalat Operations (1915–16), Mohmand Blockade (1916–17), Operations against the Mahsuds (1917) and Operations against the Marri and Khetran tribes (1918).|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} expound on how {{the arrangement}} came to be: the children's stepmother, Parwana, grew up as the less-favored child to her beautiful twin sister Masooma. One day, {{in a flash of}} jealousy, she caused Masooma to suffer a debilitating injury that resulted in paraplegia. Parwana subsequently spent several years caring for her sister until the latter asked her to help her commit suicide and to then marry Saboor. Their older brother, Nabi, left to work for Mr. Wahdati, a wealthy man <b>in</b> <b>Kabul,</b> and became infatuated with his wife, Nila. After Nila expressed dismay about her inability to have children, Nabi arranged for Pari to be sold to the couple.|$|E
5|$|Hafizullah Amin {{was born}} to a Ghilzai Pashtun family in Paghman on 1 August 1929. His father, a civil servant, {{died when he was}} still very young. Thanks to his brother Abdullah, a primary school teacher, Amin was able to attend both primary and {{secondary}} school, which in turn allowed him to attend Kabul University (KU). After studying mathematics there, he also graduated from the Darul Mualimeen Teachers College <b>in</b> <b>Kabul,</b> and became a teacher. Amin later became vice-principal of the Darul Mualimeen College, and then principal of the prestigious Avesina High School, and in 1957 left Afghanistan for Columbia University in New York City, where he earned M. A. in education. It was at Columbia that Amin became attracted to Marxism, and in 1958 he {{became a member of the}} university's Socialist Progressive Club. When he returned to Afghanistan, Amin became a teacher at Kabul University, and later, for the second time, the principal of Avesina High School. During this period Amin became acquainted with Nur Muhammad Taraki, a communist. Around this time, Amin quit his position as principal of Avesina High School in order to become principal of the Darul Mualimeen College.|$|E

5|$|In November 2001, {{as part of}} Operation Enduring Freedom {{with the}} United States, the United Kingdom invaded Afghanistan to topple the Taliban in Operation Herrick. The 3rd Division were {{deployed}} <b>in</b> <b>Kabul</b> {{to assist in the}} liberation of the capital and defeat Taliban forces in the mountains. In 2006 the British Army began concentrating on fighting Taliban forces and bringing security to Helmand Province, with around 9,500 British troops (including marines, airmen and sailors) deployed at its peak—the second-largest force after that of the US. In December 2012 Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the combat mission would end in 2014, and troop numbers gradually fell as the Afghan National Army took over the brunt of the fighting. Between 2001 and 26 April 2014 a total of 453 British military personnel died in Afghan operations. Operation Herrick ended with the handover of Camp Bastion on 26 October 2014, but the British Army maintains a deployment in Afghanistan as part of Operation Toral.|$|E
5|$|Karmal {{was born}} Sultan Hussein on 6 January 1929, {{was the son}} of Muhammad Hussein Hashem, a Major General in the Afghan Army and former {{governor}} of the province of Paktia, and was the second of five siblings. His family was one of the wealthier families <b>in</b> <b>Kabul.</b> His ethnic background is disputed, some claim that he was Tajik who represented himself as a Ghilzai Pashtun but others claim that he descended from Hindu ancestors of Kashmir. In 1986, Karmal announced that he, and his brother Mahmud Baryalay, were Pashtun because their mother came from the Mullakhel branch of the Pashtuns. However, this was controversial, considering that lineage in Afghanistan is supposed to be traced through the father, not the mother. The accusation that he was of Indian Muslim ancestry {{comes from the fact that}} his birthname, Sultan Hussein, is a common Indian Muslim name. In addition, Karmal's own father denied his own ethnicity; Karmal's father was a Tajik. To further confuse the matter, Karmal spoke Dari (Persian) and not Pashto.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the next}} decade, Amanullah Khan instituted {{a number of}} social and {{constitutional}} reforms which had first been advocated by the Niedermayer-Hentig expedition. The reforms were instituted under a ministerial cabinet. An initial step was made towards female emancipation when women {{of the royal family}} removed their veils; educational institutions were opened to women. The education system was reformed with a secular emphasis and with teachers arriving from outside Afghanistan. A German school that opened <b>in</b> <b>Kabul</b> at one point offered the von Hentig Fellowship, devoted to postgraduate study in Germany. Medical services were reformed and a number of hospitals were built. Amanullah Khan also embarked on an industrialisation drive and nation-building projects, which received substantial German collaboration. By 1929, Germans were the largest group of Europeans in Afghanistan. German corporations like Telefunken and Siemens were amongst the most prominent firms involved in Afghanistan, and the German flag carrier Deutsche Luft Hansa became the first European airline to initiate service to Afghanistan.|$|E
