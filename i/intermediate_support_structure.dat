40|$|In {{article was}} {{formulated}} and {{solved the problem}} of conditional nonlinear technical and economic optimization of the distance between <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports,</b> uniform in height, during {{the design of the}} cable metro lines in highly urban-ized city environment. The optimization problem involves a single-criterion objective function that expresses the cost of construction of the cable metro line (total cost of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and their foundations, traction and carrying steel cables and technical equipment). The specified objective function subject to minimization by finding the optimal combination of the distance between <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and tension carrying ropes with accounting constructive, modal, structural and planning constraints in the form of nonlinear inequalities. The optimization algorithm was based on the direct method of optimization type, Hooke-Jeeves, which was modified taking into account the need of varying the height of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> with a constant step equal to the step of unification. When constructing the objective function were considered three possible forms sagging of carrying ropes, which can be implemented for various values of the efforts of their tension. Analysis was done of the influence of the step unification and minimum size of interme-diate supports on their optimum step, the cost of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports,</b> the cost of 1 km cable metro line for different values of the angle of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief along the cable metro line. The graph of height of uni-fied supports from the angle of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief has discrete-step type. With the increase of the step unify the discreteness increases: the width of the range of angles of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief within which the height of the supports remains constant, increases. The graph of step installation of unified supports along the cable metro line from the angle of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief also has discrete-step type. The transition to a larger height unified <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> determines the need for installation of supports with a large pitch. Its value then begins to decrease monotonically with further increase of the angle of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief until it needs to transition to the new size of supports. Synchronous change in the optimal values of the height and step of the installation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports,</b> depending on the angle of the longitudinal slope of the sur-face relief leads {{to the fact that the}} optimal cost characteristics of the cable metro lines are smooth functions. It has an extreme character with a minimum at angles of inclination of the surface elevation ~ 5 degrees, which is associated with the form of sagging of the load-bearing ropes. Unification of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> has little effect on the optimal cost characteristics of the cable metro lines. Even for a sufficiently large step of the unification the largest difference in op-timal value is almost insignificant: it lies in the range of 2 [...] . 3 %, increasing with increasing the angle of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief and unit cost of the <b>intermediate</b> <b>support.</b> Unification of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> according to the height and their step practically does not affect the optimal value for horizontal tension on the load-bearing ropes.

When constructing the objec-tive function were considered three possible forms sagging of carrying ropes, which can be implemented for various values of the efforts of their tension. Analysis was done of the influence of the angle of the longitudinal slope of the surface relief along the line of the cable metro on the value of the optimal distance between <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> de-pending on the design and cost of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and at the cost of 1 km line of the cable metro. Quantitative calculations showed that with the increase of the longitudinal slope of the surface construction cost also increases with nonlinear increasing rate. The dependence of the cost of 1 km of line underground cable metro from the parameters of the relief is of extreme character with a pronounced minimum at small angles of inclination of the terrain surface about 3 [...] . 60 degrees. The position of the minimum is quite stable and only slightly changes when enough significant change in the cost of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and installed on them technological equipment. The most effective conditions for the construction of the cable metro is the terrain with considerable differences in altitude {{along the length of the}} route of transport: only if the surface inclination of more than 50 [...] . 60 degrees cost of 1 km line starts to exceed the cost of 1 km line laid along a strictly horizontal surface. At small angles of inclination of the surface (less than 6 [...] . 8 degrees) to min-imize the cost of construction of the cable metro line requires more frequent installation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports.</b> How-ever, despite the possibility of building a lower and cheaper supports, the observed increased values of the cost of 1 km of optimum option of the line. At large angles of inclination of the surface a need for a more rare setup higher interme-diate supports. Within the tilt angle 10 [...] . 60 degrees the range of variation of the optimal step is small enough, amount-ing to no more than ± 10 % from the value of the step at an angle of inclination of the surface 10 degree. In the range of small angles of inclination of the terrain surface (3 [...] . 6 degrees) observed abrupt changes in the basic technical and eco-nomic characteristics of the cable metro lines. This is due to the change of the forms sagging of load-bearing ropes. The increase in the number of supporting ropes has a very small economic effect (within 4 %). It does not change the opti-mal characteristics of such line, as a step of the installation and the height of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports,</b> shape and sagging boom carrying ropes. However, the significantly reduced diameter of the supporting rope and the horizontal force ten-sion. The increase in aggregate strength of carrying ropes provides a directly proportional increase in the optimal step installation of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and leads to a marked decrease in the cost of construction of the cable metro lines. At the height of <b>intermediate</b> <b>supports</b> and the horizontal force of the tension carrying ropes of their aggregate strength influence practically does not, however, leads to a significant reduction in the required diameter of the supporting ropes. It also has a positive effect on reducing the cost characteristics of the construction cable metro line.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: The lack {{of jobs in}} South Africa and eMalahleni {{has caused}} many young people to seek their own job {{opportunities}} {{in the form of}} setting up their own business. Despite this, many young business people fail in their ventures due to low capital. In response to this, organisations such as the National Youth Development Agency have created <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> to <b>support</b> young business owners in their local area. The {{purpose of this study is}} to explore the extent to which the structures and programmes to support youth development – as far as entrepreneurship is concerned – help to cultivate the creation of businesses among the black youth in eMalahleni. Thirty participants who are young entrepreneurs (under 35 years) participated in interviews that helped to elucidate qualitative information about the <b>support</b> <b>structures.</b> They were asked how the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> had helped them if they participated, or the reasons why they chose not to use the <b>support</b> <b>structure.</b> They were also asked to identify potential bottlenecks or issues with the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> that may be preventing them from being fully accessible. The results showed that a lack of trust in the <b>support</b> <b>structures,</b> particularly those created by the National Youth Development Agency, was a major reason for non-participation or choice not to use. Additionally, many felt that the hierarchy and unwelcoming atmosphere of the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> prevented young people from applying. Other reasons given were the fact that the <b>support</b> <b>structures</b> may not always be geographically accessible and the fact that staff members were not fully trained to be as helpful as possible.
