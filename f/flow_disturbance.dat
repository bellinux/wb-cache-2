It is demonstrated that a measure of the localised influence of <b>flow</b> <b>disturbances</b> on the period-average flow can be realised by the relative significance of their kinetic energy, which is quantified by the introduced Oscillatory Kinetic Energy Index (OKEI). A specific measure of direction-reversing oscillations is also developed with the introduction of the Oscillatory Flow Index (OFI), which is an extension of the wall-bound Oscillatory Shear Index (OSI) onto flow and wall spaces.

The mock Orion parachute compartment is dropped from an altitude of 25,000 feet from a C-130. Testing began in 2007. Drogue chutes deploy around 20,000 and 15,000 feet. Testing of the reefing staged parachutes includes partial failure instances including partial opening and complete failure of one of the three main parachutes. With only two chutes deployed the DTA lands at 33 feet per second, the maximum touchdown speed for Orion's design. Other related test vehicles include the now-defunct Orion Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV) and its replacement the Generation II Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV2). The drop test program has had several failures in 2007, 2008, and 2010. The new PTV was successfully tested February 29, 2012 deploying from a C-17.

Compared with MIS {{in a conventional}} cart-based OR, performing MIS in a dedicated integrated operating room (OR) {{is supposed to be}} beneficial to patient safety. The aim {{of this study was to}} compare a conventional OR with an integrated OR with regard to the incidence and effect of equipment-related surgical <b>flow</b> <b>disturbances</b> during an advanced laparoscopic gynecological procedure [laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH) ]. Methods: Using video recording, 40 LHs performed between November 2010 and April 2012 (20 in a conventional cart-based OR and 20 in an integrated OR) were analyzed by two different observers. Outcome measures were the number, duration and effect (on a seven-point ordinal scale) of the surgical <b>flow</b> <b>disturbances</b> (e. g., malfunctioning, intraoperative repositioning, setup device). Results: A total of 103 h and 45 min was observed. The interobserver agreement was high (kappa. 85, p <. 001). Procedure time was not significantly different (NS) [conventional OR vs. integrated OR, minutes ± standard deviation (SD), mean 161 ± 27 vs. 150 ± 34]. A total of 1651 surgical <b>flow</b> <b>disturbances</b> were observed (mean ± SD per procedure 40. 8 ± 19. 4 vs. 41. 8 ± 15. 9, NS). The mean number of surgical <b>flow</b> <b>disturbances</b> per procedure with regard to equipment was 6. 3 ± 3. 7 versus 8. 5 ± 4. 0, NS. No clinically relevant differences in the mean effect of these disturbances on the surgical flow between the two OR setups were observed. Conclusions: Performing LH in an integrated OR did not reduce the number of surgical <b>flow</b> <b>disturbances</b> nor the effect of these disturbances. Furthermore, in the integrated OR, repositioning of the monitors was a frequent and time-consuming source of disturbance. In order to maintain the high standard of surgical safety, the entire surgical team has to be aware that by performing surgery in an integrated OR different potential source for disruption arise. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Arterial {{restenosis}} following stent deployment may {{be influenced}} by the local flow environment within and around the stent. We have used computational fluid dynamics to investigate the flow field in the vicinity of model stents positioned within straight and curved vessels. Our simulations have revealed the presence of flow separation and recirculation immediately down-stream of stents. In steady flow within straight vessels, the extent of <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> downstream of the stent increases with both Reynolds number and stent wire thickness but is relatively insensi-tive to stent interwire spacing. In curved vessels, <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> downstream of the stent occurs along both the inner and outer vessel walls with the extent of disturbance dependent on the angle of vessel curvature. In pulsatile flow, the regions of flow distur-bance periodically increase and decrease in size. Non-Newtonian fluid properties lead to a modest reduction in <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> downstream of the stent. In more realistic stent geometries such as stents modeled as spirals or as intertwined rings, the nature of stent-induced <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> is exquisitely sensitive to stent de-sign.

Numerical simulations were conducted to analyze the stability characteristics of a lab-scale thermocline tank subject to a <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> during charging under different operating temperatures. The charging process was first simulated at a constant Reynolds number for three different Atwood numbers; a stably stratified fluid layer develops inside the storage tank in all cases. A <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> was then introduced at the inlet of the stratified thermocline tank by inserting colder fluid {{for a short period}} of time. The disturbance interacts with the thermocline and causes oscillations and mixing. The thermocline oscillations are under-damped and lead to an increase in thermocline region thickness. The transient behavior of the thermocline and the decay rate in its oscillations were analyzed; the damping time depends on the Atwood number. The persistence of <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> effects during long-term cyclical operation was also investigated. Several charge/discharge cycles were simulated at constant Reynolds number to obtain a time-periodic thermal response for each Atwood number. The characteristic <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> was introduced at the inlet during a single charging process, and the thermocline region was observed during several subsequent charge/discharge cycles to assess the long-term temporal attenuation of the disturbance. The thermocline almost fully recovers to the time-periodic behavior after a single cycle. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

To simulate <b>flow</b> <b>disturbances</b> that are representative of those generated by cross-stream fuel injection vortex generators of semipyramidal shape are attached at two locations in the REST inlet.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We {{addressed}} {{the hypothesis that}} blood flow could be imaged by Doppler color flow mapping of the coronary arteries and characteristic patterns described in normal and diseased vessels. Background. Echocardiographic imaging of the epicardial coronary arteries has been suggested as a useful adjunct to their intraoperative evaluation. Addition of Doppler color flow mapping could potentially enhance this evaluation by displaying the <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> produced by anatomic lesions whose physiologic significance may otherwise be uncertain. In experimental models, such displays could also potentially provide insights into the pathophysiology of coronary blood flow and stenosis. Methods. Epicardial coronary arteries were examined with a high resolution 7 -MHz linear phased-array transducer both in vivo and in vitro. 1) The coronary arteries were studied in the beating hearts of 10 open chest dogs in which experimental stenoses were also created; the maximal extent of the arterial tree in which flow {{could be seen in}} the most ideal setting was also examined in four additional excised perfused canine hearts. 2) Six excised human coronary arteries were perfused in a pulsatile manner to determine whether abnormal flow patterns could be prospectively identified and subsequently correlated with pathologic evidence of stenosis. Results. All normal coronary artery segments studied showed homogeneous flow without evidence of <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance.</b> In the excised heart, flow could be visualized to the distal extent of the epicardial vessels; in the open chest model, visualization of the proximal 5 to 6 cm was comparable, although surrounding structures limited access to the terminal portions of the vessels. The stenotic lesions created in the canine hearts (n = 9) showed recognizable alterations in the flow pattern: localized aliasing, proximal blood flow acceleration, distal <b>flow</b> <b>disturbance</b> and recirculatory flow. In the excised human arteries, these features identified 12 lesions, all of which corresponded to areas of ≥ 50 % lumen narrowing by pathologic examination. Conclusion.
