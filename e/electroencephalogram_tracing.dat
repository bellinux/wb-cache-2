5000|$|The first {{symptom of}} CJD is usually rapidly {{progressive}} dementia, leading to memory loss, personality changes, and hallucinations. Myoclonus (jerky movements) typically occurs in 90% of cases, {{but may be}} absent at initial onset. [...] Other frequently occurring features include anxiety, depression, paranoia, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and psychosis. This is accompanied by physical problems such as speech impairment, balance and coordination dysfunction (ataxia), changes in gait, rigid posture, and seizures. In most patients, these symptoms are accompanied by involuntary movements {{and the appearance of}} an atypical, diagnostic <b>electroencephalogram</b> <b>tracing.</b> The duration of the disease varies greatly, but sporadic (non-inherited) CJD can be fatal within months or even weeks. Most victims die six months after initial symptoms appear, often of pneumonia due to impaired coughing reflexes. About 15% of patients survive for two or more years.|$|E
40|$|Encephalopathy in a {{dialysis}} patient {{treated with}} lanthanum carbonate (LC) Sir, Dr Fraile et al. [1] report the interesting {{case of a}} dialysis patient who was treated with lanthanum carbonate (LC; 2000 mg daily for 8 months increased to 3500 mg daily for the subsequent 10 months) and developed acute confu-sional syndrome. Conduct disorders and delirious ideas were also observed. The neurological examination was normal and the <b>electroencephalogram</b> <b>tracing,</b> as well as brain Com-puted Tomography scan, was also referred as normal. After removing LC from therapy, the patient improved in 72 h. Interestingly, Dr Fraile assessed LC concentration in cer-ebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in serum and the levels were very high (33. 85 and 49 lg/L, respectively). The LC serum an...|$|E
40|$|Abstractâ€”We {{examined}} the effects of both intrinsic neuronal membrane properties and network parameters on oscillatory activity in a model of the neocortex. A scalable network model with six different cell types was built with the pGENESIS neural simulator. The neocortical network consisted of two types of pyramidal cells and four types of inhibitory interneurons. All cell types contained both fast sodium and delayed rectifier potassium channels for generation of action potentials. A subset of the pyramidal neurons contained an additional slow-inactivating (persistent) sodium current (NaP). The neurons with the NaP current showed spontaneous bursting activity in the absence of external stimulation. The model also included a routine to calculate a simulated <b>electroencephalogram</b> <b>trace</b> fro...|$|R

The medical need in this field is to reach an early differential diagnosis between subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the healthy elderly (CTR) using only the recording and the analysis of few minutes of their EEG...|$|R
50|$|A {{subclinical}} seizure is {{a seizure}} that, being , does not present any clinical signs or symptoms. Such seizures are often experienced {{by people with}} epilepsy, in which an <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG) <b>trace</b> will show abnormal brain activity, usually for a short time, but level of consciousness is normal. This is often manifest as a single spike on the EEG trace or a slowing of brain activity not correlating to what the person notices or experiences. Subclinical seizures can be useful to a neurologist in the diagnosis of epilepsy.|$|R
40|$|The {{seriousness}} of the obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome {{is measured by the}} apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), the number of sleep apneas and hypopneas over the total sleep time (TST). Cardiorespiratory signals are used to detect respiratory events while the TST is usually assessed by the analysis of <b>electroencephalogram</b> <b>traces</b> in polysomnography (PSG) or wrist actigraphy trace in portable monitoring. This paper presents a sleep/wake automatic detector that relies on a wavelet-based complexity measure of the midsagittal jaw movement signal and multilayer perceptrons. In all, 63 recordings were used to train and test the method, while 38 recordings constituted an independent evaluation set for which the sensitivity, the specificity, and the global agreement of sleep recognition, respectively, reached 85. 1 %, 76. 4 %, and 82. 9 %, compared with the PSG data. The AHI computed automatically and only from the jaw movement analysis was significantly improved (p < 0. 0001) when considering this sleep/wake detector. Moreover, a sensitivity of 88. 6 % and a specificity of 83. 6 % were found for the diagnosis of the sleep apnea syndrome according to a threshold of 15. Thus, the jaw movement signal is reasonably accurate in separating sleep from wake, and, in addition to its ability to score respiratory events, is a valuable signal for portable monitoring.

40|$|We explore {{some aspects}} of the {{analysis}} of latent component structure in non-stationary time series based on time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models that incorporate uncertainty about model order. Our approach assumes that at each time, model order evolves according to a discrete random walk and can take values up to a specified upper bound. Priors that are conjugate-normal are considered for the autoregressive coefficients and the evolution of such coefficients over time is specified through a random walk. Simulation from the posterior distribution of the AR coefficients and model order can be obtained via a Gibbs sampling format based on Forward Filtering Backward Simulation algorithms. Aspects of model implementation and inference on decompositions and latent structure are discussed for some synthetic data and for <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG) <b>traces</b> previously analysed with fixed order TVAR models.

40|$|We explore {{some aspects}} of the {{analysis}} of latent component structure in non-stationary time series based on time-varying autoregressive (TVAR) models that incorporate uncertainty on model order. Our modelling approach assumes that the AR coecients evolve in time according to a random walk and that the model order may also change in time following a discrete random walk. In addition, we use a conjugate prior structure on the autoregressive coecients and a discrete uniform prior on model order. Simulation from the posterior distribution of the model parameters can be obtained via standard Forward Filtering Backward Simulation algorithms.

40|$|Internet {{of things}} (IoT) {{applications}} {{have become increasingly}} popular in recent years, with applications ranging from building energy monitoring to personal health tracking and activity recognition. In order to leverage these data, automatic knowledge extraction - whereby we map from observations to interpretable states and transitions - must be done at scale. As such, we have seen many recent IoT data sets include annotations with a human expert specifying states, recorded {{as a set of}} boundaries and associated labels in a data sequence. These data can be used to build automatic labeling algorithms that produce labels as an expert would. Here, we refer to human-specified boundaries as breakpoints. Traditional changepoint detection methods only look for statistically-detectable boundaries that are defined as abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. However, we observe that breakpoints occur on more subtle boundaries that are non-trivial to detect with these statistical methods. In this work, we propose a new unsupervised approach, based on deep learning, that outperforms existing techniques and learns the more subtle, breakpoint boundaries with a high accuracy. Through extensive experiments on various real-world data sets - including human-activity sensing data, speech signals, and <b>electroencephalogram</b> (EEG) activity <b>traces</b> - we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for practical applications. Furthermore, we show that our approach achieves significantly better performance than previous methods...|$|R
