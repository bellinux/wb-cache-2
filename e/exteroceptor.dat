Initial discoveries by babies are accidental until they become coordinated and curious enough to actively investigate their surroundings. This thesis explores the development of such primitive learning systems using an embodied light-weight hand with three fingers and a thumb. It is self-contained having four motors and 36 <b>exteroceptor</b> and proprioceptor sensors controlled by an on-palm microcontroller. Primitive manipulation is learned from sensory inputs using competitive learning, back-propagation algorithm and reinforcement learning strategies. This hand {{will be used for}} a humanoid being developed at the MIT Artificial Ingelligence Laboratory. Thesis Supervisor: Rodney A.

5000|$|The way we {{perceive}} our body and our surroundings {{is a function}} of the way our brain interprets signals from our various sensory systems, such as sight, sound, balance and touch. Special sensory pick-up units (or sensory [...] "pads") called receptors translate stimuli into sensory signals. External receptors (<b>exteroceptors)</b> respond to stimuli that arise outside the body, such as the light that stimulates the eyes, sound pressure that stimulates the ear, pressure and temperature that stimulates the skin and chemical substances that stimulate the nose and mouth. Internal receptors (enteroceptors) respond to stimuli that arise from within blood vessels.|$|R
40|$|Most {{vertebrates}} show respiratory and circulatory reflexes {{which can}} be traced to stimulation of various extero- or interoceptors. Widely distributed groups of <b>exteroceptors,</b> with a variety of stimulus modalities, are associated with defence reflexes which protect the respiratory passages and gas exchange surfaces. Other <b>exteroceptors</b> are associated only with the gas exchange surfaces. These are either mechanoreceptors or chemoreceptors and have a range of different dynamic characteristics, but are none-the-less amazingly uniform in their role in control of the normal breathing pattern. Intravascular receptors stimulated by the arterial blood pressure are located on all the gills in fishes, yet appear to be restricted to the pulmocutaneous arteries in anuran amphibians and to the truncal region or aortic root in reptiles and birds. On the other hand, the distribution of glomus-sustentacular-nerve cell complexes, associated with intravascular chemoreception, appears to be much more diffuse in higher than lower vertebrates. The wide distribution of these cell complexes may be attributed to their embryological origin from neural crest cells. Even so, the presence of these complexes {{does not appear to be}} essential for respiratory responses to environmental hypoxia since they have not been located in teleost fishes. The role of peripheral receptors in controlling cardiovascular and respira-tory functions, under steady state conditions in non-mammalian vertebrates, is not well defined and it may be that they are only modulators of circulatory and respiratory patterns arising from hormonal or humoral effects on the central nervous system...|$|R
50|$|Peripheral chemoreceptors (of the carotid and aortic bodies) are {{so named}} because they are sensory {{extensions}} of the peripheral nervous system into blood vessels where they detect changes in chemical concentrations. As transducers of patterns of variability in the surrounding environment, carotid and aortic bodies count as chemosensors {{in a similar way}} as taste buds and photoreceptors. However, because carotid and aortic bodies detect variation within the body’s internal organs, they are considered interoceptors. Taste buds, olfactory bulbs, photoreceptors, and other receptors associated with the five traditional sensory modalities, by contrast, are <b>exteroceptors</b> in that they respond to stimuli outside the body. The body also contains proprioceptors, which respond to the amount of stretch within the organ, usually muscle, that they occupy.|$|R
40|$|Through {{a review}} of Slovenian and foreign {{literature}} the thesis presents the child's integrated development in the pre-school period. We focused on motor development, where we highlighted all motor abilities, especially the balance. Identifying the development of individual motor abilities in children {{is very different from}} identifying the same abilities in adults. Many factors of integrated development significantly affect the result and the person who measures cannot provide adequate answers. Balance is the motion or motor skill which is critical for the implementation of any motor task (such as: riding a bicycle, throwing a ball or swimming). Irrespective {{of the fact that the}} selected task can develop another motor ability, you first have to command your body so that it does not fall, and only then, when the performance is reliable, you can develop endurance, strength, coordination, balance, accuracy, speed, mobility. Therefore, in the pre-school period, some tests, designed to measure other abilities (eg., repetitive power) show that they actually measure balance. Measurement of motor skills in the pre-school period includes factors of integrated development, so the tests are often inadequate for adults. Balance is the motor ability, which includes sensory inputs of musculoskeletal balance, which are divided into proprioreceptors and <b>exteroceptors.</b> Proprioreceptors are important, since they are located inside the body, and include the equilibrium body, which is an organ in the inner ear that gives information on the position of the head. On the other hand <b>exteroceptors</b> include organs from the surface of the body. <b>Exteroceptors</b> and proprioreceptors are intertwined and cannot be separated. The problem that we explored in the thesis was to determine the differences in the execution of some tasks of balance (methodical units) between children aged two and four years. We selected five methodical units that were constructed on previous studies, and should be an indicator of the balance in the pre-school period. Children performed each task twice, and we looked for differences in their performance and made a comparison between younger and older children. The research included forty children; twenty of them were two years old and twenty four years old. We assessed differences in their performance with quantitative and qualitative variables. It was assumed that older children would perform the task faster, that their performance would be more reliable, that they would insist in the equilibrium position for a longer period of time, that the task would be repeated several times in the same time, that they would jump from the higher rungs, and that they would manage a certain route faster. The hypotheses were confirmed. Above all, younger children proved less reliable and they performed balance tasks for a shorter period of time, which means that these tasks could be used by kindergarten teachers not only to test balance, but primarily for the development of balance. ...|$|R
5000|$|Proprioceptors are receptors {{located in}} your muscles, tendons, joints {{and the inner}} ear, which send signals to the brain {{regarding}} the body's position. An example of a [...] "popular" [...] proprioceptor often mentioned by aircraft pilots, is the [...] "seat of the pants". In other words, these sensors present a picture to your brain as to {{where you are in}} space as external forces act on your body. Proprioceptors respond to stimuli generated by muscle movement and muscle tension. Signals generated by <b>exteroceptors</b> and proprioceptors are carried by sensory neurons or nerves and are called electrochemical signals. When a neuron receives such a signal, it sends it on to an adjacent neuron through a bridge called a synapse. A synapse [...] "sparks" [...] the impulse between neurons through electrical and chemical means. These sensory signals are processed by the brain and spinal cord, which then respond with motor signals that travel along motor nerves. Motor neurons, with their special fibres, carry these signals to muscles, which are instructed to either contract or relax.|$|R
40|$|Amputation of a limb or a tooth {{leads to}} the loss {{of a large number of}} <b>exteroceptors.</b> These play an {{important}} role in sensory perception and feedback, which tune the motor control. Even after rehabilitation with a prosthetic device, tactile function remains impaired. This can present a subsequent risk of overloading the prosthesis. The peri-implant interface of oral osseointegrated implants is characterized by the absence of a periodontal ligament, a crucial difference towards the natural dentition, from a biomechanical but also from a neurophysiologic point of view. Patients rehabilitated with osseointegrated implants seem subjectively not much impaired in their masticatory and other oral functions. This observation might be linked to the presence of some peripheral feedback pathway to the sensory cortex. It may be attributed to the activation of receptors in the peri-implant environment (either bone or periosteum). This phenomenon called osseoperception, when it relates to the consciousness of the applied stimuli, has been described for both oral and skeletal implants. In the present review, besides osseoperecption other neurophysiological aspects of oral implants, such their reflex function, will be outlined and their clinical meaning pointed out. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

40|$|WE {{naturally}} {{think of}} ourselves as air inhabiting animals, but even a slight examination would show that we are separated from the air which surrounds us by a layer of dead cells in the outer horny portion of the skin or by a layer of mucus. All that is alive within these lifeless surfaces is bathed in a salty fluid—the "milieu interne'', as Claude Bernard called it, or the fluid matrix, as we may designate it. Thus our bodies have not only the external en-vironment which other objects have but our living parts have also an in-ternal environment composed of the rapidly flowing blood and the more slowly flowing lymph. In relation to the external and in-ternal environments we may separate the nervous system into two grand divisions. The division with which we are commonly acquainted, the so-called "voluntary system", attached to the bony skeleton, serves to change the external environment and our relations to it. This system also is supplied with surface sense organs, or <b>exteroceptors,</b> serving to acquaint us with our sur-roundings. Since our reactions to these surroundings are directed toward ob-jects in the outer world, we may speak of this grand division of the nervous system as the exterofective system. The second grand division is the so-called "involuntary", "vegetative", or "autonomic " system which brings about changes in the internal environment. It may be regarded, therefore, as hav-ing interofective functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Humans rely {{on their}} hands to perform {{everyday}} tasks. The hand {{is used as a}} tool, but also as the interface to “sense ” the world. Current prosthetic hands are based on sophisticated multi-fingered structures, and include many sensors which counterpart natural proprioceptors and <b>exteroceptors.</b> The sensory information is used for control, but not sent to the user of the hand (amputee). Grasping without sensing is not good enough. This research is part of the development of the sensing interface for amputees, specifically addressing the analysis of human perception while grasping. The goal is to determine the small number of preferred positions of sensors on the prosthetic hand. This task has previously been approached by trying to replicate a natural sensory system characteristic for healthy humans, resulting in a multitude of redundant sensors and basic inability to make the patient aware of the sensor readings on the subconscious level. We based our artificial perception system on the reported sensations of humans when grasping various objects without seeing the objects (obstructed visual feedback). Subjects, with no known sensory deficits, were asked to report on the touch sensation while grasping. The analysis included objects of various sizes, weights, textures and temperatures. Based on this data we formed a map of the preferred positions for the sensors that is appropriate for five finger human-like robotic hand. The final map was intentionally minimized in size (number of sensors) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{processing}} of mechanosensory signals {{responsible for the}} reflex adjustment of the posture or movement of {{the legs of the}} locust is described in terms of the actions and connections of identified neurones. Signals can be followed from the major classes of <b>exteroceptors</b> of a leg, through their various integrative stages in the central nervous system to their emergence as specific patterns in known motor neurones. Particular emphasis is placed on the integrative roles of two classes of local interneurones. The spiking local interneurones map the leg as a series of overlapping receptive fields and reverse the sign of the afferent input. The nonspiking local interneurones control the output of the motor neurones by the graded release of chemical transmitter and can adjust the gain of a local reflex depending on the position and movements of the joints of that leg. The reflex movements of one leg must not impair the stability of the animal and must therefore be influenced by events at the other legs. Populations of intersegmental interneurones convey sensory information from one segment to another to ensure such coordination. These interneurones do not produce stereotyped intersegmental reflexes but, instead, alter the performance of a local reflex in a distant leg by making synaptic connections with nonspiking local interneurones. These connections change the effectiveness of the outputs to the motor neurones and consequently the local reflex. The local interneurones therefore play a crucial role both in the production of local reflexes and in the integration of these actions with the movements of the other legs...|$|R
40|$|Gravity, {{which is}} sensed {{directly}} by the otolith organs and indirectly by proprioceptors and <b>exteroceptors,</b> provides the CNS a fundamental reference for estimating spatial orientation and coordinating movements in the terrestrial environment. The sustained absence of gravity during orbital space flight creates a unique environment that cannot be reproduced on Earth. Loss of this fundamental CNS reference upon insertion into orbit triggers neuro-adaptive processes that optimize performance for the microgravity environment, while its reintroduction upon return to Earth triggers neuro-adaptive processes that return performance to terrestrial norms. Five pioneering symposia on The Role of the Vestibular Organs in the Exploration of Space were convened between 1965 and 1970. These innovative meetings brought together the top physicians, physiologists, and engineers in the vestibular field to discuss and debate the challenges associated with human vestibular system adaptation to the then novel environment of space flight. These highly successful symposia addressed the perplexing {{problem of how to}} understand and ameliorate the adverse physiological effects on humans resulting from the reduction of gravitational stimulation of the vestibular receptors in space. The series resumed in 2002 with the Sixth Symposium, which focused on the microgravity environment as an essential tool for the study of fundamental vestibular functions. The three day meeting included presentations on historical perspectives, vestibular neurobiology, neurophysiology, neuroanatomy, neurotransmitter systems, theoretical considerations, spatial orientation, psychophysics, motor integration, adaptation, autonomic function, space motion sickness, clinical issues, countermeasures, and rehabilitation. Scientists and clinicians entered into lively exchanges on how to design and perform mutually productive research and countermeasure development projects in the future. The problems posed by long duration missions dominated these discussions and were driven by the paucity of data available. These issues along with more specific recommendations arising from the above discussions will be addressed an upcoming issue of the Journal of Vestibular Research...|$|R
40|$|We aim to {{summarise}} the impact and mechanisms of work-rate pacing during individual cycling time trials (TTs). Unlike time-to-exhaustion tests, a TT provides an externally valid model for examining how an initial work rate is chosen and maintained by an athlete during self-selected exercise. The selection {{and distribution of}} work rate {{is one of many}} factors that influence cycling speed. Mathematical models are available to predict the impact of factors such as gradient and wind velocity on cycling speed, but only a few researchers have examined the inter-relationships between these factors and work-rate distribution within a TT. When environmental conditions are relatively stable (e. g. in a velodrome) and the TT is > 10 minutes, then an even distribution of work rate is optimal. For a shorter TT (350 watts). During a TT, pacing strategy is regulated in a complex anticipatory system that monitors afferent feedback from various physiological systems, and then regulates the work rate so that potentially limiting changes do not occur before the endpoint of exercise is reached. It is critical that the endpoint of exercise is known by the cyclist so that adjustments to exercise work rate can be made within the context of an estimated finish time. Pacing strategies are thus the consequence of complex regulation and serve a dual role: they are both the result of homeostatic regulation by the brain, as well as being the means by which such regulation is achieved. The pacing strategy 'algorithm' is sited in the brain and would need afferent input from interoceptors, such as heart rate and respiratory rate, as well as <b>exteroceptors</b> providing information on local environmental conditions. Such inputs have been shown to induce activity in the thalamus, hypothalamus and the parietal somatosensory cortex. Knowledge of time, modulated by the cerebellum, basal ganglia and primary somatosensory cortex, would also input to the pacing algorithm as would information stored in memory about previous similar exercise bouts. How all this information is assimilated by the different regions of the brain is not known at present...|$|R
