500|$|The {{design team}} for the series {{conceived}} eighteen outfits to compliment Gaga's [...] and eccentric reputation, although they did not collaborate with any of Gaga's stylists or creative director Nicola Formichetti. Due to the outfits' unconventional appearances, Jean was given more freedom to animate the large array of costumes, as these rapid changes [...] "wouldn't be possible in real life".
