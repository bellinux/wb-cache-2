5|$|Joust 2 is a 2D combat game {{taking place}} in the air and on landing platforms, like its predecessor. The player {{controls}} a yellow knight riding a flying ostrich and navigates the game world with a two-way joystick and a button. The joystick controls the <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction</b> that the knight travels, while pressing the button makes the ostrich flap its wings. The rate at which the player repeatedly presses the button causes the ostrich to fly upward, hover, or slowly descend. The objective is to defeat groups of enemy knights riding buzzards that populate each level, referred to as a wave. Upon completing a wave, a more challenging one will begin.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{architecture}} of English cathedrals is so diverse and inventive, the internal appearances differ a great deal. However, in general, English cathedral interiors tend to give an impression of length. This is in part {{because many of the}} buildings are actually very long, but also because more than in the medieval architecture of any other country, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction</b> is given as much visual emphasis as the vertical. This is particularly the case at Wells where, unlike most Gothic buildings, there are no vertical shafts that continue from the arcade to the vault and there is a very strong emphasis on the triforium gallery with its seemingly endless and undifferentiated row of narrow arches. Salisbury has a similar lack of verticals while the course below the triforium and the undecorated capitals of Purbeck stone create strong visual horizontals. In the cases of Winchester, Norwich and Exeter the horizontal effect is created by the emphasis on the ridge rib of the elaborate vaults.|$|E
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction</b> and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress to the next level. Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} cause of the {{excessive}} vibration in rotating machines is the rotor mass unbalance. If a machine vibration due to mass unbalance exceeds the alarm limits, then it may lead to machine failure. Therefore, rotating machines should be regularly checked to ensure that they are properly balanced. Currently, industries use the influence coefficient (IC) balancing technique for in situ machine balancing. The accepted practice is to use the vibration measurements in both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>directions</b> at the machine-bearing pedestals together with the tachometer signal to estimate the machine rotor unbalance (both mass and phase angle). It is generally believed that the use of the machine vibration measurements in the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>directions</b> represents better machine dynamics, and hence the estimated unbalance is likely to be more accurate. However, this paper applies the same concept of the IC method but with a reduced number of vibration sensors (one sensor per bearing pedestal at 45 ° instead of two sensors at the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>directions).</b> The use of one sensor per bearing pedestal at 45 ° from both vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>directions</b> is likely to have responses from both directions. The {{reduction in the number of}} sensors by half will definitely save the instruments and their maintenance cost and reduce the computational effort in the signal processing significantly. The proposed concept is applied on a small-size laboratory rig with two balancing planes. The paper presents the unbalance estimations by using the measured vibration responses in both the vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>directions</b> simultaneously and using vibration responses measured at 45 °...|$|R
5|$|All {{these facts}} are {{consequences}} of the thermal wind relation. The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on {{the mass of the}} parcel and the buoyancy force, or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel. Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction: upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight, and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force. The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic. Beyond the tropics, the dominant forces act in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction,</b> and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force. Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic. Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance, one can derive the thermal wind relation: the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient. If two air masses, one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South, are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed, the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass. The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward-moving mass to deviate to the East, while equatorward-moving mass will deviate toward the west. The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction. As a result, winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude. Therefore, the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence {{of the fact that the}} Equator is warmer than the North and South poles.|$|E

The vertical is frequency, or sometimes time. Another display technique is to color-code frequency-time information for bearing. More recent displays are generated by the computers, and mimic radar-type plan position indicator displays.|$|E

As {{expected}} from our previous discussion for linear systems, {{this phenomenon is}} also more pronounced for smaller values of ϵ (compare Figs.  14 a and  14 b) since limit cycle trajectories move in more <b>horizontal</b> <b>directions</b> for smaller values of ϵ, and {{they are able to}} reach larger voltage values. As ϵ increases, limit cycle trajectories move in less <b>horizontal</b> <b>directions</b> and, consequently, they do not take advantage of the extra available region of motion in the envelope-plane created by the nonlinear v-nullcline.|$|R

25|$|In {{the table}} below, several flow {{quantities}} and parameters according to Airy wave theory are given. The given quantities {{are for a}} bit more general situation as for the solution given above. Firstly, the waves may propagate in an arbitrary <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction</b> in the x=(x,y) plane. The wavenumber vector is k, and is perpendicular to the cams of the wave crests. Secondly, allowance is made for a mean flow velocity U, in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction</b> and uniform over (independent of) depth z. This introduces a Doppler shift in the dispersion relations. At an Earth-fixed location, the observed angular frequency (or absolute angular frequency) is ω. On the other hand, in a frame of reference moving with the mean velocity U (so the mean velocity as observed from this reference frame is zero), the angular frequency is different. It is called the intrinsic angular frequency (or relative angular frequency), denoted as σ. So in pure wave motion, with U=0, both frequencies ω and σ are equal. The wave number k (and wavelength λ) are independent of the frame of reference, and have no Doppler shift (for monochromatic waves).|$|E

The bitumen {{is found in}} the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction.</b> The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon disulphide), with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring and ball) around 120°C. The insoluble matter, consisting mainly of silica ore, ranges from 8% to 17%.|$|E

25|$|In polymer demixing, polymer blends {{experience}} spontaneous phase separation; {{it often}} occurs during {{conditions such as}} spin casting onto silicon wafers. Features that can be created by this method include nanoscale pits, islands, and ribbons, which can be controlled to an extent by adjusting the polymer ratio and concentration to change the feature shape and size, respectively. There is not much control in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction,</b> though the vertical direction of the features can be precisely controlled. Because the pattern is very unordered horizontally, this method can only be used to study cell interactions with specific height nanotopographies.|$|E
25|$|Scripts {{are also}} {{graphically}} {{characterized by the}} direction in which they are written. Egyptian hieroglyphs were written either left to right or right to left, with the animal and human glyphs turned to face the beginning of the line. The early alphabet could be written in multiple directions: horizontally (side to side), or vertically (up or down). Prior to standardization, alphabetical writing was done both left-to-right (LTR or sinistrodextrally) and right-to-left (RTL or dextrosinistrally). It was most commonly written boustrophedonically: starting in one (<b>horizontal)</b> <b>direction,</b> then turning {{at the end of the}} line and reversing direction.|$|E

This had {{advantages}} for installation on aircraft, but it would be even more practical if the beam could be steered electronically, as opposed to mechanically. By delaying the signal slightly as it travelled down the long antenna, which could be arranged through a number of means, the phase angle would vary, causing the resulting signal to be focussed in a given direction. Since the antenna didn't have to move in order to scan, this led to the possibility of embedding the antenna in the leading edges of the aircraft wings, or similar solutions.|$|E

25|$|The Circum-Superior Belt {{was formed}} 1,884to 1,864million {{years ago when}} the Superior craton was {{surrounded}} by mountain building processes, including the Trans-Hudson, New Quebec and Penokean orogenies. The major Trans-Hudson orogeny had its appearance when the Superior craton collided with the Rae-Hearne craton 1,900to 1,800million years ago. Massive orogenic belts with a change in <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction</b> are represented by the double promontory structure of the Superior craton that seem to have come from the beginning of a rifting event. The New Quebec orogen, also known as the Labrador Trough, lies at the northeastern portion of the Superior craton and is related to ocean closure and collision with the southeastern portion of the Rae craton. At 1,900and 1,800million years ago, an ocean closure and collision with the Wisconian arc terrane resulted {{in the creation of the}} Penokean orogeny at the southern Superior craton margin. The last collision occurred on the southeastern portion of the Superior craton to produce the Grenville orogeny 1,100million years ago.|$|E
25|$|In {{the arch}} dam, {{stability}} is obtained {{by a combination}} of arch and gravity action. If the upstream face is vertical the entire weight of the dam must be carried to the foundation by gravity, while the distribution of the normal hydrostatic pressure between vertical cantilever and arch action will depend upon the stiffness of the dam in a vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction.</b> When the upstream face is sloped the distribution is more complicated. The normal component of the weight of the arch ring may be taken by the arch action, while the normal hydrostatic pressure will be distributed as described above. For this type of dam, firm reliable supports at the abutments (either buttress or canyon side wall) are more important. The most desirable place for an arch dam is a narrow canyon with steep side walls composed of sound rock. The safety of an arch dam is dependent on the strength of the side wall abutments, hence not only should the arch be well seated on the side walls but also the character of the rock should be carefully inspected.|$|E
25|$|Cleanrooms {{maintain}} particulate-free {{air through}} the use of either HEPA or ULPA filters employing laminar or turbulent air flow principles. Laminar, or unidirectional, air flow systems direct filtered air downward or in <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction</b> in a constant stream towards filters located on walls near the cleanroom floor or through raised perforated floor panels to be recirculated. Laminar air flow systems are typically employed across 80% of a cleanroom ceiling to maintain constant air processing. Stainless steel or other non shedding materials are used to construct laminar air flow filters and hoods to prevent excess particles entering the air. Turbulent, or non unidirectional, air flow uses both laminar air flow hoods and nonspecific velocity filters to keep air in a cleanroom in constant motion, although not all in the same direction. The rough air seeks to trap particles that may be in the air and drive them towards the floor, where they enter filters and leave the cleanroom environment. US FDA and EU have laid down guidelines and limit for microbial contamination which is very stringent to ensure freedom from microbial contamination in pharmaceutical products.|$|E

The wave propagation in each grid point was calculated by solving equations of motions using a staggered-grid FDM with fourth-order and second-order in space and time, respectively. With a minimum S-wave velocity (0.3  km/s) and grid size (0.15  km), the FDM simulations can examine seismic wave propagation for periods longer than 4  s with sampling of eight grid points per minimum S wavelength.|$|R
25|$|Especially {{due to the}} {{presence}} of the ground, there are some differences in propagation (and also in reflections responsible for TV ghosting) between horizontal and vertical polarizations. AM and FM broadcast radio usually use vertical polarization, while television uses horizontal polarization. At low frequencies especially, horizontal polarization is avoided. That is because the phase of a horizontally polarized wave is reversed upon reflection by the ground. A distant station in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>direction</b> will receive both the direct and reflected wave, which thus tend to cancel each other. This problem is avoided with vertical polarization. Polarization is also important in the transmission of radar pulses and reception of radar reflections by the same or a different antenna. For instance, back scattering of radar pulses by rain drops can be avoided by using circular polarization. Just as specular reflection of circularly polarized light reverses the handedness of the polarization, as discussed above, the same principle applies to scattering by objects much smaller than a wavelength such as rain drops. On the other hand, reflection of that wave by an irregular metal object (such as an airplane) will typically introduce a change in polarization and (partial) reception of the return wave by the same antenna.|$|E
