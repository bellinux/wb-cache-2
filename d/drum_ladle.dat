50|$|The {{most common}} {{of these other}} shapes {{is known as a}} <b>drum</b> <b>ladle</b> and is shaped as a {{horizontal}} cylinder suspended between two bogies. Large versions, often having capacities in excess of 100 tonnes are used in steel mills are often referred to as torpedo ladles. Torpedo ladles are commonly used to transport liquid iron from a blast furnace {{to another part of the}} steel mill. Some versions are even adapted so that they can be carried on special bogies that can be transported by either road or rail.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} studies {{on the use of}} modern two cored wires {{injection}} method for production of ferritic nodular cast iron (ductile iron) with use of unique implementation of <b>drum</b> <b>ladle</b> as a treatment / transport and casting ladle instead vertical treatment ladle was described. The injection of length of Ã˜ 9 mm wires, cored: in FeSi + Mg nodulariser mixture and inoculant master alloy is a treatment method which can be used to produce iron melted in coreless induction furnace. This paper describes the results and analysis of using this method for optimal production of ductile iron under specific industrial conditions. It means, that length of nodulariser wire plus treatment and pouring temperatures were optimized. In this case, was taken ductile iron with material designation: EN-GJS-SiMo 40 - 6 Grade according EN 16124 : 2010 E. Microstructure of great number of trials was controlled on internally used sample which has been correlated with standard sample before. The paper presents typical ferritic metallic matrix and nodular graphite. Additionally, mechanical properties were checked in some experiments. Mean values of magnesium recovery and cost of this new method from optimized process parameters were calculated as well...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to agriculture, crafts were a part-time occupation {{and were not}} hereditary. Regionally traded products of importance were <b>drums,</b> <b>ladles,</b> stools, storage boxes for grain, and snuffboxes of horn. Iron and cloth were very important in regional networks, but the cloth industry in particular was ailing in 1857 because of severe competition from India, {{and over the next}} sixty years almost disappeared. Ironwork came from localized settlements whose products were then traded over wide areas: bows, arrows, spears, the payment of fines, and the extremely valuable hoes for bridewealth were all produced with considerable ritual by the smiths; and depending on the place that was blamed, for the heavy deforestation to obtain charcoal.|$|R
