40|$|Rubber {{toughened}} polyamide 6 /polypropylene (PA 6 /PP) nanocomposites containing 4 wt % of organophilic modified montmorilonite (OMMT) {{were produced}} by melt compounding followed by injection moulding. Four {{different types of}} <b>elastomer</b> were incorporated into the blends as a toughener, i. e., ethylene-octene <b>elastomer</b> (POE), ethylene-propylene <b>elastomer</b> (EPR), maleated POE (POEgMAH) and maleated EPR (EPRgMAH). The influences of maleating on the interfacial adhesion and mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were investigated in term of mechanical testing, the X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observation.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIn vitro cadaveric {{studies showed}} that <b>elastomer</b> femoroplasty {{prevents}} displacement of fracture parts after proximal hip fracture allowing for conservative treatment. In the event that secondary displacement does occur, {{the purpose of this}} present {{study was to determine the}} feasibility of performing osteosynthesis of a fractured hip after preventive treatment with <b>elastomer</b> femoroplasty. MethodsTen pairs of human cadaveric femurs were fractured in a simulated fall configuration. From each pair, one femur was randomly selected for <b>elastomer</b> femoroplasty prior to fracture generation and the contralateral femur was used as control. Following hip fracture generation, osteosynthesis was performed in all femurs. The operative time per case, technical difficulties during the procedure, and postoperative energy-to-failure load were recorded. ResultsThe mean (SD) time to perform osteosynthesis was 20 (6) minutes in the control-group and 19 (5) minutes in the <b>elastomer</b> femoroplasty-group (P= 0. 69). During osteosynthesis of the fractured hip in the <b>elastomer</b> femoroplasty-group, no difficulties including the need for additional instruments to remove <b>elastomer</b> from the proximal femur were recorded. Postoperative energy-to-failure load was similar in the control-group and the <b>elastomer</b> femoroplasty-group.

40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the {{vibration}} transmission in multi-storey wood buildings, it is common to insert viscoelastic <b>elastomer</b> materials between parts of the buildings. The studies presented here investigate to which extent different design choices for the <b>elastomer</b> layers affect the isolation of low-frequency vibrations (0 - 100 Hz). A finite element model of two storeys of a multi-storey wood building, involving blocks of <b>elastomer</b> material in between the storeys, was used to perform numerical investigations. Parametric studies were carried out, considering different properties of the <b>elastomer</b> material and different placements of the <b>elastomer</b> blocks. Considering the transmission from the floor of the upper storey to the underlying ceiling, the material properties of the <b>elastomer</b> material were found to affect the vibration levels appreciably. A too stiff <b>elastomer</b> material can result in an amplification of the vibration levels in the ceiling for certain frequencies, whilst a less stiff material, in general, reduces the vibration transmission. The placement of the <b>elastomer</b> blocks was varied by shifting the position of the blocks while maintaining their centre-to-centre distance, resulting in a small effect on the vibration levels...|$|R

25|$|Beyond {{the elastic}} limit, {{permanent}} deformation will occur. The elastic limit is therefore the lowest stress at which permanent deformation can be measured. This requires a manual load-unload procedure, and the accuracy is critically {{dependent on the}} equipment used and operator skill. For <b>elastomers,</b> such as rubber, the elastic limit is {{much larger than the}} proportionality limit. Also, precise strain measurements have shown that plastic strain begins at low stresses.|$|E
25|$|A static {{discharge}} {{in the presence}} of air or oxygen can create ozone. Ozone can degrade rubber parts. Many <b>elastomers</b> are sensitive to ozone cracking. Exposure to ozone creates deep penetrative cracks in critical components like gaskets and O-rings. Fuel lines are also susceptible to the problem unless preventive action is taken. Preventive measures include adding anti-ozonants to the rubber mix, or using an ozone-resistant elastomer. Fires from cracked fuel lines have been a problem on vehicles, especially in the engine compartments where ozone can be produced by electrical equipment.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of ozone, only a few materials may be used like stainless steel (quality 316L), titanium, aluminium (as long as no moisture is present), glass, polytetrafluorethylene, or polyvinylidene fluoride. Viton may be used with the restriction of constant mechanical forces and absence of humidity (humidity limitations apply depending on the formulation). Hypalon may be used with the restriction that no water {{come in contact with}} it, except for normal atmospheric levels. Embrittlement or shrinkage is the common mode of failure of <b>elastomers</b> with exposure to ozone. Ozone cracking is the common mode of failure of elastomer seals like O-rings.|$|E
40|$|New {{designs of}} {{dielectric}} <b>elastomer</b> sensors (DES) which are capable to detect compression loads on rigid {{as well as}} on compliant surfaces are introduced in this paper. Currently, DES films exhibit only very poor sensitivity in terms of the change of electric capacitance upon increasing loads for compression measurements. In the new sensor mats, the compression load is converted to a tensile load which acts on an <b>elastomer</b> film located between two profiled <b>elastomer</b> components. In addition, the deformation of the <b>elastomer</b> profiles can also contribute to the sensor effect. All <b>elastomer</b> components were prepared of silicone. A number of parameters which have an influence on the characteristic dependence of capacitance on compression load are discussed. A main influence results from the shape of the <b>elastomer</b> profiles which stretch the <b>elastomer</b> film inside. Also very important are the number and the locations of electrode layers in the sensor mat between which the capacitance is measured. Finally, the hardness of the <b>elastomer</b> plays also a decisive role for the sensor sensitivity. This broad variability of the sensor design offers a high potential to tune the sensor characteristics. Various examples of compression sensors are described and the impact of structural and material parameters is discussed...|$|R

25|$|Polymer {{oxidation}} {{has caused}} accidents involving medical devices.

If cracking occurs in the engine compartment, electric sparks can ignite the gasoline and can cause a serious fire. In medical use degradation of polymers can lead to changes of physical and chemical characteristics of implantable devices.|$|E

PE-X does not melt anymore (analogous to <b>elastomers)</b> and is thermally resistant (over longer periods of up to 120°C, for short periods without mechanical load up to 250°C). With increasing crosslinking density also the maximum shear modulus increases (even at higher temperatures). PE-X has significantly enhanced properties compared with ordinary PE. As PE-X is infusible, always the final pre-products or the mold part are cross-linked.|$|E
