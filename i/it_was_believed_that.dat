5|$|In 1896, {{an article}} in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a {{practice}} of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia {{two or three years}} earlier. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial by}} ducking (immersing the accused, bound, in water, {{to see if}} she would float) appears to have been used only once in Virginia, to try Sherwood. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that,</b> as water was {{considered}} pure, it would reject witches, causing them to float, whereas the innocent would sink.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> CIAT {{works by}} the {{mechanism}} of increased neuroplasticity. By constraining an individual to use only speech, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the brain can reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.|$|R
50|$|In the Ayyavazhi tradition, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> in {{the final}} judgement, the demon will be sentenced to hell while Vaikundar and Santror will rule the world.

50|$|A {{group of}} eagles was seen {{circling}} nearby this temple {{during the height}} of the Kumbabishega ceremony. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the eagles represents Garuda - the vahana of Lord Vishnu. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the presence of Garuda indicates that lord Vishnu has blessed the occasion.|$|R
5|$|During {{the years}} {{preceding}} {{the siege of}} Venice, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the Ottoman Empire had preparations underway to attack Malta. This suspicion became stronger when a well-groomed man, who had approached the Order to serve as engineer and offer his wealth of knowledge about fortifications, disappeared shortly after having surveyed Malta's fortifications. Consequently, the Order began its preparations to counter any possible attack by the Ottoman army.|$|E
5|$|Following World War II, several {{searches}} {{of the waters}} around North Stradbroke and Moreton Islands failed to reveal Centaurs location. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> she had sunk {{off the edge of}} the continental shelf, to a depth at which the Royal Australian Navy did not have the capability to search for a vessel of Centaurs size. Some parties also believed that Rippon's calculated point of sinking was inaccurate, either intentionally or through error.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> neither played a crucial role any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> for the seeking of fishing,agriculturing {{opportunity}} some catholic {{people came}} from Jaffna, Navaali, Allaipitti,etc {{and settled in}} Vidathaltheevu and they made a foundation for this St James Church. And also <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the derivatives of them are living now in Vidathaltheevu.|$|R

5|$|Improvement of {{neurological}} function usually occurs {{for two or}} {{more years}} after the trauma. For many years <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> recovery was fastest {{during the first six}} months, but {{there is no evidence to}} support this. It may be related to services commonly being withdrawn after this period, rather than any physiological limitation to further progress. Children recover better in the immediate time frame and improve for longer periods.|$|E
5|$|In his research, Chadwick {{continued}} {{to probe the}} nucleus. In 1925, the concept of spin had allowed physicists to explain the Zeeman effect, but it also created unexplained anomalies. At the time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the nucleus consisted of protons and electrons, so nitrogen's nucleus, for example, with a mass number of 14, was assumed to contain 14 protons and 7 electrons. This gave it the right mass and charge, but the wrong spin.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{selective}} pressure, {{controlled by}} Washington, combined with diplomatic overtures, would prevail and compel Hanoi {{to end its}} aggression. The military was still not satisfied, since, for the time being, the bombing campaign was {{to be limited to}} targets below the 19th parallel, each of which would have to be cleared individually by the President and McNamara.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} {{of the history of}} the animals before their {{installation}} in the 1917 carousel assembly. During the 1960s newspaper reports stated that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the animals had arrived in Indianapolis in 1917, imported from Germany by two brothers named Mangels, but later research revealed the animals were manufactured by the Dentzel carousel company. Also included in the installation were oil paintings on the canopy over the animals and mechanism.|$|E
5|$|Originally <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Lake Cahuilla {{formed around}} 900 AD and existed until 1500 but with {{fluctuations}} as the Colorado River changed its course. In 1978, Philip J. Wilke proposed that two highstands occurred, one between 900 and 1250 and another between 1300-1500. Another proposal by Waters in 1983 suggested highstands 700-900, 940-1210 and after 1250, the latter with some brief recessions to lower lake levels. Both proposals were criticized {{on the grounds}} that they came to definite conclusions with insufficient information.|$|E
5|$|The great Orcadian Neolithic monuments were {{constructed}} almost a millennium before the sarsen stones of Stonehenge were erected. At one time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> this flowering of culture was essentially peripheral {{and that its}} origins were to be found to the south on mainland Great Britain. However, recently discovered evidence shows that Orkney was the starting place {{for much of the}} megalithic culture, including styles of architecture and pottery, that developed much later in the southern British Isles.|$|E

5|$|The raskovnik is {{believed}} to have been sought after by treasure hunters, sorcerers and herbalists who desired its magic powers for personal benefit. In Serbia, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> there exist certain treasures, such as the Treasure of Tsar Radovan, which could not be unlocked in any other way but employing a raskovnik.|$|E
5|$|The ritual was {{normally}} performed between Michaelmas and Easter, when {{cold weather}} made it {{less likely to}} contract a disease from the infected subject. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the treatment {{was more likely to}} be successful if performed on a holy day. English monarchs generally touched less frequently than their French counterparts. Edward I touched up to 1,736 people annually, but did not touch during his frequent military campaigns abroad. His immediate successors followed a similar pattern.|$|E
5|$|According to Plutarch, Alcibiades {{had several}} famous teachers, {{including}} Socrates, and was well {{trained in the}} art of Rhetoric. He was noted, however, for his unruly behavior, which was mentioned by ancient Greek and Latin writers on several occasions. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Socrates took Alcibiades as a student because he believed he could change Alcibiades from his vain ways. Xenophon attempted to clear Socrates' name at trial by relaying information that Alcibiades was always corrupt and that Socrates merely failed in attempting to teach him morality.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{decision}} to disband the Ranger units, the 2nd Ranger Company was deactivated on 1 August 1951 while it was still in Korea. Like many of the other Ranger units, most of the 2nd Ranger Company veterans were folded into the 187th RCT. As an airborne unit, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> by sending the men to the 187th, their airborne skills could be used. Nevertheless, in the end it turned out that Operation Tomahawk was the last airborne jump of the war and as a result, the former Rangers did not get a chance to exercise these skills again.|$|E
5|$|At {{present the}} golden white-eye is very common, {{and in fact}} a 1996 study found that their densities on Saipan were among the highest {{recorded}} for any bird, up to 2,095 birds/km² (8.47 per acre). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> Saipan cannot sustain a larger population of this white-eye than it already does. A 2009 study, which incorporated results from a 2007 survey, found that the species had declined between 1982 and 2007, in common with two other species on Saipan, the rufous fantail and the nightingale reed warbler. All three species are insectivorous and were theorised to have declined due to habitat loss. Nevertheless, the species remained relatively abundant, and the current world population is estimated at around 71,997 birds.|$|E
5|$|Between 1885 and 1908 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> {{the signal}} {{had been sent}} using the 1799 code book, as in 1885 {{it was pointed out}} that this had not been {{replaced}} until 1808. In 1908 it was discovered, the Admiralty had, in fact, changed the signal code in November 1803, after the 1799 version had been captured by the French, and new code books had been issued to Nelson's fleet at Cadiz in September 1805. As a result, books published between these two dates show the signal using the wrong flags.|$|E

50|$|Traditional beliefs such as Susto, {{also known}} as fear illness, is thought to occur when the soul leaves the body and wanders. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> women {{experience}} this more often than men. Empacho, or the dislocation of body functions {{is often associated with}} morning sickness in pregnancy because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> the baby <b>is</b> bringing increased energy to the digestive process. Mal de Ojo is another important perceived cause of illness which relates to birth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> if someone <b>is</b> looked upon with admiration or jealousy that they will become ill themselves.|$|R
