25|$|In 1995, the Thile {{family moved}} to Murray, Kentucky, where Chris' father Scott Thile {{accepted}} a position at Murray State University as a musical instrument technician. In 1997, Chris released Stealing Second and Nickel Creek released <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> <b>There.</b> Chris went on to attend Murray State University for a few semesters, {{where he was a}} music major.|$|E
25|$|Nickel Creek's first {{performance}} was at That Pizza Place in Carlsbad, California in 1989 with Scott Thile, Chris's father, playing string bass. The {{oldest of the}} Watkins children, Sean was only twelve {{years old at the}} time. At the start of Nickel Creek's history, Chris Thile played guitar and Sean Watkins played mandolin but later they decided to switch instruments. The band played many bluegrass festivals throughout the 1990s, and the band members were home-schooled to accommodate their tour schedule. Nickel Creek's first two albums were Little Cowpoke (1993) and <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> <b>There</b> (1997).|$|E

I started using stopwatches and everything. I found it was impossible to throw some other guys out also. They can go from first to second in 2.9 seconds; and no pitcher catcher combination in baseball could throw from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there</b> to tag second in 2.9 seconds, it was always 3, 3.1, 3.2. So actually, the runner that can make the continuous, regular move like Rickey's can't be thrown out, and he's proven it." ...|$|E

[...] "I've had a vision for my name since I was very young, that I {{was going to take}} it to the top of my industry", he says.

2500|$|Welch {{did with}} Fox her first {{starring}} vehicle, the British Modesty Blaise-style spy movie Fathom (1967), filmed in Spain. Second unit director Peter Medak said Welch [...] "was {{at that time}} quite inexperienced, exactly {{like one of those}} American drum majorettes. But she tried very hard and went to see the rushes each day, gradually improving. 'Who's this dumb broad?' people used to say. But I said: 'You wait. I'll bet she makes it.' I liked her very much because she was such a genuine person. And she had a beautiful body which always helps." [...] Welch said her role was [...] "a blown up Barbie doll." [...] Reviewing her performance, the Los Angeles Times film critic said that [...] "each new Raquel Welch picture brings further proof that when Maria Montez died they didn't break the mold. Like Maria, Raquel can't act from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there,</b> but both ladies seem to have been born to be photographed... this sappiest of spy pictures." ...|$|E

Perhaps all the wonders I seemed to see, even the Road by which souls travel from There to Here and from <b>Here</b> <b>to</b> <b>There,</b> and the Gates that were burned away, and the City of the Mansions that descended, were but signs and symbols of mysteries which as yet we cannot grasp or understand.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't want {{anything}} to go,--that is, as far as real life is concerned. There's that dear good Bishop of Abingdon is the best friend I have in the world,--and as for the Bishop of Dorchester, I'd walk from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there</b> to hear him preach.

6000|$|The {{human mind}} {{has a much}} more complex and {{fluctuating}} process than most of those explanatory people who write about psychology would have us believe. Instead of that simple, direct movement, like the movement of a point, forward and from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there,</b> one's thoughts advance like an army, sometimes extended over an enormous front, sometimes in échelon, sometimes bunched in a column throwing out skirmishing clouds of emotion, some flying and soaring, some crawling, some stopping and dying.... In this matter of Labor, for example, I have thought so much, thought over the ground again and again, come into it from this way and from that way, that {{for the life of}} me I find it impossible to state at all clearly how much I made of these questions during that Johannesburg time. I cannot get back into those ancient ignorances, revive my old astonishments and discoveries. Certainly I envisaged the whole process much less clearly than I do now, ignored difficulties that have since entangled me, regarded with a tremendous perplexity aspects that have now become lucidly plain. I came back to England confused, and doing what confused people are apt to do, clinging to an inadequate phrase that seemed at any rate to define a course of action. The word [...] "efficiency" [...] had got hold of me. All our troubles came, one assumed, from being [...] "inefficient." [...] One turned towards politics with a bustling air, and was all for fault-finding and renovation.|$|E
60|$|Dickory did {{not care}} to go anywhere, but he had hardly said so when a revulsion of feeling came upon him, and turning away so that his face might not be noticed, {{he said he thought}} the land air might do him good. While the men were at work {{carrying}} their pails from the well-known spring to the water-barrels in the boat, Dickory strolled about to view the scenery, for it could never have been expected that a first lieutenant in uniform should help to carry water. At first the scenery {{did not appear to be}} very interesting, and Dickory wandered slowly from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> <b>there,</b> then sat down under a tree. Presently he rose and went to another tree, a little farther away from the boat and the men at the spring. Here he quietly took off his shoes and his stockings, and, having nothing else to do, made a little bundle of them, listlessly tying them to his belt; then he rose and walked away somewhat brisker, but not in the direction of the boat. He did not hurry, but even stopped sometimes to look at things, but he still walked a little briskly, and always away from the boat. He had been so used, this child of outdoor life, to going about the world barefooted, that it was no wonder that he walked briskly, being relieved of his encumbering shoes and stockings.|$|E
