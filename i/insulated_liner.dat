40|$|Substrate vias {{are widely}} used in GaAs {{microwave}} and millimeter-wave ICs to provide low impedance ground connections. As silicon RFICs strive for high-frequency operation, it becomes increasingly important to reduce all extrinsic parasitics. Of particular concern is the MOSFET source or BJT emitter impedance, which greatly affects the gain of RF amplifiers. To address this, we have developed a through-wafer via technology for silicon, which allows the implementation of high-aspect ratio, low-impedance ground connections. The fabrication of these vias involves three main steps: (1) anisotropic DRIE to etch the vias, (2) PECVD silicon nitride deposition to form an <b>insulating,</b> barrier <b>liner,</b> and (3) copper electroplating to fill the via. Since our vias incorporate an <b>insulating</b> <b>liner,</b> this through-wafer via technology {{could also be used}} to distribute power and ground in logic circuits and MEMS. We have demonstrated vias with an aspect ratio as high as 14 : 1 and an inductance that approaches the theoretically expected value. Our via technology can also be exploited to reduce crosstalk and improve subsystem isolation in RF System-on-a-Chip applications. High crosstalk immunity is critical to enable one-chip systems integrating noisy logic with sensitive low-noise amplifier and analog circuitry. Using our substrate-via technology, we have implemented a novel Faraday cage isolation scheme that is successful in suppressing crosstalk by over 20 dB at 1 GHz at a distance of 100 [mu]m. by Joyce H.

40|$|Rapid {{depletion}} of {{conventional energy sources}} along with increasing demand for energy {{is a matter of}} serious concern. The fact that petroleum based fuels will neither be available in sufficient quantities nor at reasonable price in future has revived interest in exploring alternate fuels for diesel engines. Only non-edible vegetable oils can be seriously considered as fuels for engines as the edible oils are in great demand and are far too expensive as fuels. Gum formation, filter clogging, carbon deposits at the nozzle tips, higher exhaust emissions due to high exhaust temperatures are some of the problems associated with these oils. Using of vegetable oils in low heat rejection engines is the only solution to overcome problems of these oils. The high in cylinder temperature of these engines reduces the ignition delay and aids combustion. The use of vegetable oils in the LHR engine reduces HC, CO and smoke emissions.

40|$|With the {{stringent}} emission legislation {{all over}} the world an intensive search is going on for diesel fuels which produce more environmental pollution. This simulated interest in alcohol-fueled diesel engines because it is renewable bio-based resource and it is oxygenated, thereby providing the potential to reduce particulate emissions in diesel engines and ethanol diffusion flames produce virtually no soot. But due to alcohols higher latent heat of vaporization, the higher temperatures available in the Insulated engine (IE) are used for vaporizing the alcohols and this decreases the ignition delay and aids combustion. With the higher temperatures in the insulated engines there will be drop in volumetric efficiency and this further increases the frictional horse power due to thinning of lubricant. So the volumetric efficiency drop is to be compensated by turbocharging to improve the thermal efficiency of insulated engine. Hence the present experimental work is planned accordingly. In the turbocharger the exhaust gases are expended in a turbine which is further coupled to engine. Further the turbine forces more air, proportionately more fuel into the combustion chamber, thereby enhancing the power output without increasing the cylinder capacity.

40|$|Lowering {{lubricant}} viscosity {{to reduce}} friction generally carries {{a side effect}} of increased metal-metal contact in mixed or boundary lubrication, for example near top ring reversal along the engine cylinder liner. A strategy to reduce viscosity without increased metal-metal contact involves controlling the local viscosity away from top-ring-reversal locations. This paper discusses the implementation of insulation or thermal barrier coating (TBC) as a means of reducing local oil viscosity and power cylinder friction in internal combustion engines with minimal side effects of increased wear. TBC is selectively applied to the outside diameter of the cylinder liner to increase the local oil temperature along the liner. Due to the temperature dependence of oil viscosity, the increase in temperature from insulation results in a decrease in the local oil viscosity. The control of local viscosity through TBC targets areas of high hydrodynamic power losses mid-stroke while avoiding an increase in boundary friction near ring reversal. If temperatures near ring reversal remain unaltered, the expected result is the same oil viscosity, boundary friction, and wear rate near TDC as that of a non-insulated liner. In order to calculate the frictional benefit of insulating the cylinder liner, an in-cylinder heat transfer model predicts the temperatures along the liner. The local oil temperatures and engine performance parameters are then applied to a ring pack simulation to calculate the contributions to hydrodynamic and boundary friction power loss. The BsFC and wear rate results are then compared to baseline simulation data for TBC performance metrics. The results show the TBC <b>insulated</b> <b>liner</b> maintains adequate viscosity and film thickness near TDC for wear protection in the ring, while decreasing a significant portion of hydrodynamic for friction power loss in the mid-stroke. For the case studied, TBC offers a 0. 7 % BsFC improvement from the reduction in power cylinder friction with no increase in the wear rate of the ring pack. by Mark Allen Molewyk. Thesis: S.
