40|$|Currently, {{pharmaceutical}} tablets {{are manufactured}} in large batch operations that have inefficiencies {{associated with the}} stopping, re-configuration and testing between batches. Continuous manufacturing {{has the potential to}} lower manufacturing costs and energy consumption while enhancing process reliability and flexibility. Although there are many manufacturing processes that could make an impact in this sector, I focused on hot <b>extrusion</b> <b>molding.</b> Hot <b>extrusion</b> <b>molding</b> consists of heat melting a pharmaceutical resin in an extruder and packing it in a mold where it is allowed to solidify until it is ready to be ejected. I designed a hot <b>extrusion</b> <b>molding</b> system after estimating the injection pressure and cooling parameters needed to meet functional requirements. As a result, I realized the importance of using a hot runner system in order to meet criteria and be able to produce the tablets. The hot runner allows for the temperature of the melt to be controlled up until it is to be extruded into the mold, preventing pre-mature solidification and clogging in the system. From the estimations and available hardware I was able to fabricate the components for the hot <b>extrusion</b> <b>molding</b> system. The components were then assembled to be tested. by Giorgio Zampierollo. Thesis (S. B.) [...] Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering, 2010. Vita.
