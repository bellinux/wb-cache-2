25|$|However, this is {{certainly}} not entirely true. Gerard cannot have spent much, if any time in prison, as he was appointed permanent counsel by the City of London in October 1554, and represented Wigan in the English parliament {{for the third time}} in 1555. Nor can he have incurred the wrath of Mary, as he was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of a small and extremely powerful group of barristers with exclusive rights to work in the Court of Common Pleas towards the end of her reign - an appointment that lapsed on her death. He was made Justice of the Peace in five counties by 1559, many of them probably in Mary's reign: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire and Huntingdonshire. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that Gerard was much favoured by Elizabeth and one of a small group of lawyers who were quickly installed in important offices to consolidate the new regime.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that Shostakovich borrows {{extensively}} {{from the}} material and styles both of earlier composers and of popular music; the vulgarity of [...] "low" [...] music is a notable influence on this [...] "greatest of eclectics". [...] McBurney traces this to the avant-garde artistic circles of the early Soviet period in which Shostakovich moved early in his career, and argues that these borrowings were a deliberate technique {{to allow him to}} create [...] "patterns of contrast, repetition, exaggeration" [...] that gave his music the large-scale structure it required.|$|E

500|$|The {{story of}} Cynicism {{traditionally}} begins with Antisthenes (c. 445–365 BC), {{who was an}} older contemporary of Plato and a pupil of Socrates. [...] At about 25 years his junior, Antisthenes {{was one of the}} most important of Socrates' disciples. [...] Although later classical authors had little doubt about labelling him as the founder of Cynicism, his philosophical views seem to be more complex than the later simplicities of pure Cynicism. [...] In the list of works ascribed to Antisthenes by Diogenes Laërtius, writings on language, dialogue and literature far outnumber those on ethics or politics, although they may reflect how his philosophical interests changed with time. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that Antisthenes preached a life of poverty: ...|$|E
500|$|The {{refusal to}} meet the ambassadors was later {{prominently}} criticised by the Danish political opposition, twenty-two Danish ex-ambassadors and the Prime Minister's fellow party member, former Minister of Foreign Affairs Uffe Ellemann-Jensen. [...] Hervik wrote, [...] "While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that the prime minister {{did not have a}} legal right to intervene in the editorial process, he could have publicly (as an enactment of free speech) dissociated himself from the publication, from the content of the cartoons, from Rose's explanatory text, from Jyllands-Postens editorial of the same day, and from the general association of Islam with terrorism. Rasmussen did none of those. Instead, he used his interview [...] to endorse Jyllands-Posten's position and the act of publishing the cartoons." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the junior}} {{officers}} in the flank parties had difficulty stopping their exhausted, enraged men from killing everyone they found inside these buildings. For example, two innocent drunks who refused {{to hide in the}} basement of a tavern in Menotomy were killed only because they were suspected of being involved with the day's events. Although many of the accounts of ransacking and burnings were exaggerated later by the colonists for propaganda value (and to get financial compensation from the colonial government), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that taverns along the road were ransacked and the liquor stolen by the troops, who in some cases became drunk themselves. [...] One church's communion silver was stolen but was later recovered after it was sold in Boston. [...] Aged Menotomy resident Samuel Whittemore killed three regulars before he was attacked by a British contingent and left for dead. [...] (He recovered from his wounds and later died in 1793 at age 98.) [...] All told, far more blood was shed in Menotomy and Cambridge than elsewhere that day. The colonists lost 25 men killed and nine wounded there, and the British lost 40 killed and 80 wounded, with the 47th Foot and the Marines suffering the highest casualties. [...] Each was about half the day's fatalities.|$|E

60|$|That stirred her, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true,</b> and his {{gentleness}} {{had also}} its effect.

2500|$|Now {{that more}} {{is known about}} the trends in {{empirical}} measures of profitability, the debate focuses more on the underlying concepts. Simon Mohun states that the rate of profit is [...] "most easily measured as the proportion of net output not returned as wages to the aggregate fixed capital stock" [...] and that it is this rate of profit that is [...] "generally used in empirical work". If the growth of the gross profit component of value-added (P) is statistically compared with the growth of the estimated fixed capital stock plus inventory holdings (C), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that almost all measures will show that the ratio P/C does drop over time. The real value of the physical capital stock appears to grow faster in real terms than the real value of the operating surplus associated with that physical stock, in the long run. The same effect persists even when various different depreciation techniques are used. The data trend is analogous to a rising tendency of the capital coefficient, where in the course of time more and more capital is required to obtain each additional increase in output. The profit rate rises again, only after a major crisis or a war which destroys a sufficiently large amount of capital value, raises the rate of surplus value, and clears the way for new production techniques.|$|E

Squercum said but little, remembering that his client was not always clear in the morning as to anything he had done on the preceding evening.

50|$|Nonetheless, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that Eleru {{possessed the}} talents and skills {{necessary}} to occupy the post of Senior Consort. First of all she was extremely beautiful.

She was highly intelligent and perceptive. Anyone who met her or spoke with her could not help but fall under her bewitching spell. And she had long reconciled herself to her lot; throughout their imprisonment in the Çırağan Palace, she remained completely loyal to her husband. After Murad's death and proclamation of the Constitution, she purchased a home in Şişli and retreated there to live a life of seclusion. She died on 21 February 1936.|$|R
6000|$|Our priests {{likewise}} dispute several circumstances {{about the}} resurrection of the dead, the nature of our bodies after the resurrection, and in what manner they shall be united to our souls.

60|$|The way {{she talked}} about expecting news--and important!--made him feel somehow {{that she had a}} career, that she was active and independent, so that he could {{scarcely}} hope to stop her as she passed. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that he had never seen any girl like her. It would have occurred to him that the news she was expecting might have reference to the favour she had begged of the President, if he hadn't already made up his mind--in the calm of meditation after that talk with the Bonnycastles--that this favour must be a pleasantry. What she had said to him had a discouraging, a somewhat chilling effect; nevertheless <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not without a certain ardour that he inquired of her whether, so long as she stayed in Washington, he mightn't pay her certain respectful attentions.|$|R

Apart from this, the rest was lying, clumsy lying, which said one thing at least for him, {{that he was not}} accustomed to falsehood and deceit. Good Heavens! if my husband was to be believed, his mother must have tracked us to London, tracked us to the church, tracked us to the railway station, tracked us to Ramsgate!

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not <b>true,</b> however, {{that the}} views of the Fischer school have come to be almost universally shared, either inside Germany or out.

The chief and real purpose of the Republican party is eminently conservative.

Particularly, he told them that Diabolus was almost ready for his march, and that he had made old Mr. Incredulity, that once brake prison in Mansoul, the, general of his army; that his army consisted all of Doubters, and that their number was above twenty thousand. He told, moreover, that Diabolus did intend to bring with him the chief princes of the infernal pit, and that he would make them chief captains over his Doubters.

500|$|Marochetti was {{not popular}} with the Victorian artistic establishment; Punch {{referred}} to him derisively as [...] "Count Marrowfatty", while John Timbs wrote that he [...] "owed more of his success in life to royal and noble patrons than artistic merit." [...] <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>true</b> that he benefited from the patronage of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. His courtly manners impressed Victoria on their first meeting in 1849, and soon afterwards he became involved with the Prince Consort's plans for what became The Great Exhibition of 1851. Several countries planned to display sculptures of romantic historical figures in {{their contributions to the}} exhibition. The genre was common in mainland Europe but relatively rare in England at the time. Marochetti was probably aware that the Belgian sculptor Eugene Simonis intended to show his statue of Godfrey de Bouillon, the leader of the First Crusade, which King Leopold I of Belgium had commissioned. The two men had a number of connections; they shared the same bronze founder, Soyer of Paris, and Simonis was influenced by Marochetti's earlier acclaimed statue of the Duke of Savoy, Emanuele Filiberto. The Italian sculptor was probably motivated by a sense of competition with the Belgian in designing his RichardI.|$|R
