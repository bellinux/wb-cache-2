2500|$|Triumph {{set up an}} {{assembly}} facility in Speke, Liverpool in 1959, gradually increasing {{the size of the}} company's most modern factory {{to the point that it}} could produce 100,000 cars per year. However, only a maximum of 30,000 cars was ever produced as the plant was never put into full production use, being used largely as {{an assembly}} plant. During the 1960s and '70s Triumph sold a succession of Michelotti-styled saloons and sports cars, including the advanced Dolomite Sprint, which, in 1973, already had a 16-valve four-cylinder engine. It is alleged that many Triumphs of this era were unreliable, especially the 2.5 PI (petrol injection) with its fuel injection problems. In Australia, the summer heat caused petrol in the <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> to vapourise, resulting in frequent malfunctions. [...] Although the injection system had proven itself in international competition, it lacked altitude compensation to adjust the fuel mixture at altitudes greater than [...] above sea level. The Lucas system proved unpopular: Lucas did not want to develop it further, and Standard-Triumph dealers were reluctant to attend the associated factory and field-based training courses.|$|E

50|$|As engines {{moved away}} from carburetors and towards fuel injection, {{mechanical}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> were replaced with <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> because <b>fuel</b> injection systems operate more efficiently at higher fuel pressures (40-60 psi) than mechanical diaphragm <b>pumps</b> can generate. <b>Electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> are generally located in the fuel tank, {{in order to use}} the fuel in the tank to cool the pump and to ensure a steady supply of fuel.|$|R

50|$|In 1929 SU {{introduced}} the Petrolift <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> {{which could be}} fitted {{as a substitute for}} the vacuum type pumps common at the time. This was superseded in 1932 by the L type fuel pump which used a solenoid to operate a diaphragm pump.|$|E
50|$|All MGBs from 1963 to 1974 used twin 1.5 in SU {{carburettor}}s. US spec {{cars from}} 1975 used a single Stromberg 1.75 in carburettor {{mounted on a}} combination intake-exhaust manifold. This greatly reduced power as well as created longevity problems as the (adjacent) catalytic converter tended to crack the intake-exhaust manifold. All MGBs used a SU-built <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E

50|$|For 1935 {{the engine}} grew to 2762 cc by {{increasing}} the stroke to 110 mm and the range designation became SC. Modifications were also made to the complex steering gear, and the front damping was improved. Twin <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> were provided. At the rear the chassis was stiffened by having side members {{above and below the}} axle.|$|R
50|$|The switch {{shown to}} the right is {{intended}} to disable an <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> in automotive applications. This functionality is required in some vehicle racing applications, since an <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> may otherwise continue operating after a collision or rollover. If the fuel line is broken or the vehicle is inverted, fuel may be spilled, creating a fire hazard. A small loose weight (called a proof mass) is trapped within a spring-loaded cage. A shock in any direction will cause movement of the mass relative to the cage. If sufficiently shocked, the cage will spring open which actuates an associated switch. The switch is reset by pressing the cage closed through the flexible (red) top cover, retrapping the mass. These switches are also used to open a contactor (a large relay) to disable the high power circuit of a battery electric vehicle upon collision.|$|E
50|$|A natural-gas-powered engine debuted for 1995 but was {{not popular}} and was only used in fleet {{vehicles}} on a very limited production run. The Cummins B Series engine was switched from the 12-valve to the 24-valve (ISB) version {{in the middle of}} the 1998 model-year Dodge Rams due to emissions regulations. The ISB featured a new computer-controlled injection pump, 24-valve head design, and an <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|E
50|$|Engine: V 8 iron block, water cooled, OHV, bore 76 mm x stroke 70 mm, {{capacity}} 2547 cc.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Holley {{continued}} new product introductions with the HP Pro Series race-ready carburetors. During this time Holley also introduced SysteMAXÂ® engine kits that included matched cylinder heads, intakes and cams. The Dominator also {{evolved in the}} 1990s into the HP Dominator; huge billet <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> were introduced, and retrofit EFI kits evolved into digital Pro-Jection 4D and 4Di.|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} {{is built}} up from spruce {{and covered in}} 3 mm plywood. Cabin width on the prototype was 38 in. The main gear uses Wittman tapered rods and was designed to take standard Cessna wheel pants. As with the Wittman Tailwind, the mains connect to the engine mount. The wing tanks feed a 5.75 imp gal header tank through automotive <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps.</b> The header tank feeds the engine by gravity.|$|R
50|$|A <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> is a {{frequently}} (but not always) {{essential component}} {{on a car}} or other internal combustion engined device. Many engines (older motorcycle engines in particular) do not require any <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> at all, requiring only gravity to feed fuel from the fuel tank or under high pressure to the fuel injection system. Often, carbureted engines use low pressure mechanical pumps that are mounted outside the fuel tank, whereas fuel injected engines often use <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> that are mounted inside the fuel tank (and some fuel injected engines have two fuel pumps: one low pressure/high volume supply pump in the tank and one high pressure/low volume pump {{on or near the}} engine).|$|R
50|$|Other {{mechanicals}} {{include a}} 5-speed gearbox (although very early AC models featured only a 4-speed), disc brakes at each wheel, power brakes, double wishbone front suspension, one carburetor per cylinder (2 Dual Weber or Solex carburetors on the BC series 1608 engine - {{except for the}} USA version which received mild carburation due to emissions constraints), <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> (on the CC series), and suspension by coil springs.|$|E
50|$|Fuel Boost Pump Switch - Controls the {{operation}} of the auxiliary <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> to provide fuel to the engine before it starts or in case of failure of the engine powered fuel pump. Some large airplanes have a fuel system that allows the flight crew to jettison or dump the fuel. When operated, the boost pumps in the fuel tanks pump the fuel to the dump chutes or jettison nozzles and overboard to atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The fuel {{sending unit}} {{assembly}} {{may be a}} combination of the <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump,</b> the filter, the strainer, and the electronic device used to measure the amount of fuel in the tank via a float attached to a sensor which sends data to the dash-mounted fuel gauge. The fuel pump by itself is a relatively inexpensive part. But a mechanic at a garage might have a preference to install the entire unit assembly.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} enter the Brazilian aftermarket, {{automotive}} components have to be labeled with the Inmetro Mark {{as well as a}} third party certification logo that has been accredited by Inmetro. These specifications were issued within the Inmetro Ordinance 301/2011 on 21 July 2011, which aims to establish minimum safety requirements for automotive components. Shock absorbers, <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> for the Otto cycle engines, horns or similar equipment employed in automotive road vehicles, pistons, lock pins and lock rings, piston rings, bearing shell and lamps need to be compliant by January 21, 2013. Until then, manufacturers and importers have to be certified as automotive parts must be labeled with the Inmetro Mark from July 22, 2013.|$|R
50|$|The KC-130J also {{provides}} for rapid ground refueling of helicopters, vehicles and fuel caches. The aircraft {{has a unique}} propeller feathering feature (known as âhotel modeâ, derived from the term hotel electric power, when a vessel or other means of transport {{is equipped with a}} power plant with the sole purpose of generating electric power for lighting, etc., rather than propulsion) which can slow (at 25% rotation speed) the propellers while the turbines continue to run and energize the generator, providing power to the <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps.</b> This reduction of the propellers' speed helps to eliminate prop wash behind the KC-130J. This allows ground forces to operate in relative calm while the aircraft offloads up to 2,271 L, 1,823 kg (600 gallons, 4,018 pounds) per minute.|$|R
5000|$|Along {{with the}} name change, came other major {{improvements}} and tweaks for the final model year of the conventional cab pickups. Single-point electronic throttle-body fuel injection (TBI) was introduced on GM's full-size pickups, with new <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> and high-pressure <b>fuel</b> lines. In addition, a [...] "smart" [...] powertrain control module (PCM) was also introduced, which controlled the fuel injection system, fuel-to-air burn ratio, engine ignition timing, and (if equipped with an automatic transmission) the Turbo Hydra-Matic's turbine torque converter clutch. The 5.7 L 350 cubic inch pushrod V-8 {{was introduced to the}} order books for R-Series and V-Series half-ton class pickups, with the new TBI fuel injection system. Horsepower and torque output was increased to 210 hp, and 300 lb-ft of torque.|$|R
5000|$|While {{technically}} {{pretty much}} identical to its predecessors, the Esplanada featured radically restyled {{front and rear}} ends. The interior featured reclinable leather seats and fine JacarandÃ¡ wood trimmings on dashboard and doors. The top Models 3M and 6M could easily be recognized by their vinyl top. The [...] engine now was fed by an <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> and featured a 34-AmpÃ¨re alternator. A newly introduced hydraulic clutch improved gear changing and driving comfort significantly, the gearbox was upgraded with an overdrive.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{engines are}} {{equipped}} with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible fuel pump in the fuel tank. Moving the fuel pump to {{the interior of the}} tank helps prevent vapor lock, since the entire fuel delivery system is under positive pressure and the fuel pump runs cooler than if it is located in the engine compartment. This is the primary reason that vapor lock is rare in modern fuel systems. For the same reason, some carbureted engines are retrofitted with an <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> near the fuel tank.|$|E
5000|$|Cars with {{electronic}} fuel injection have an electronic control unit (ECU) {{and this may be}} programmed with safety logic that will shut the <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> off, even if the engine is running. In the event of a collision this will prevent fuel leaking from any ruptured fuel line. Additionally, cars may have an inertia switch (usually located underneath the front passenger seat) that is [...] "tripped" [...] {{in the event of an}} impact, or a roll-over valve that will shut off the fuel pump in case the car rolls over.|$|E
2500|$|Flight 514 {{was over}} Usinsk, at an {{altitude}} of 10,600 m (FL 348) when the first signs of a problem were noticed at about 06:59 local time (02:59 UTC). Later, a complete loss of electrical systems occurred, which resulted in the loss of navigational systems and the loss of <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> leaving the aircraft with just [...] of usable fuel, enough for just 30 minutes flight. The loss of the electrically driven pumps prevented transfer of fuel from the wing tanks to the engine supply tank in the fuselage. At about 07:47, the emergency authorities at Izhma were informed that the aircraft may be making an emergency landing at the airport there. [...] Izhma Airport is a former airfield that is now used only for helicopters, and the [...] runway is closed and abandoned. The airfield, having closed to fixed-wing aircraft in 2003, was not marked on then-current [...] maps.|$|R
2500|$|The {{complicated}} {{routine of}} restarting went forward smoothly and within twenty minutes Ohio was steaming at sixteen knots again. Then another salvo of bombs hit the ship, shaking every plate, {{and once more}} the engines slowed and stopped. The <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> had been broken by the concussion. While the crew desperately tried to reconnect the electrical wires and restart the engines via the auxiliary steam system, the engine-room was filled with black smoke until the engines were properly re-lit. The ship was making alternate black and white smoke and, with oil in the water pipes {{and a loss of}} vacuum in the condenser, Ohio started to lose way slowly, coming to a stop at 10.50 am. The crew abandoned ship, boarding [...] that had come to Ohios aid alongside another destroyer, [...] The latter ship was soon to leave the stricken tanker after being ordered to go in search of the cruiser , which had been crippled by Italian motor torpedo boats.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Trends of the {{automotive}} market require {{the application of}} new engine technologies, which allows {{for the use of}} different types of fuel. Since ethanol is a renewable source of energy and it contributes to lower CO 2 emissions, ethanol produced from biomass is expected to increase in use as an alternative fuel. It is recognized that for spark ignition (SI) engines ethanol has advantages of high octane number and high combustion speed. In spite of the advantages of ethanol, fuel supply system might be affected by fuel blends with ethanol like a wear and corrosion of <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps.</b> So the on-board hydrogen production out of ethanol reforming can be considered as an alternative plan. This paper investigates the influence of ethanol fuel on SI engine performance, thermal efficiency and emissions. The results obtained from experiments have shown that specific fuel consumption has increased by increasing ethanol amount in the blend whereas decreased by the use of hydrogen-enriched gas. The combustion characteristics with hydrogen-enriched gaseous fuel from ethanol reforming are also examined...|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, {{these models}} {{suffered}} badly {{because of the}} summer heat. The <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> commonly overheated causing fuel to vaporise and render the engine inoperable until the pump cooled down. The overheating of the pump {{was caused by a}} combination of very high pressure fuel loads (over [...] ) and a pump that was adapted from what was originally a windscreen wiper motor. As such, it did not cope well with sustained pressures in moderate to high ambient temperatures. Because of the launch late in the Mk I's life, there are relatively few PIs in the original shape.|$|E
50|$|Device {{controls}} the ignition, fuel injection {{and various other}} actuators of {{the internal combustion engine}} (ICE) and vehicle. In particular, it is capable of controlling the carburetor's choke using a stepper motor (auto choke), thus controlling RPM when engine is warming up. Manages AFR on the carburetor (like AXTEC AFR systems), idle cut off and power valve on carburetor, <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump,</b> stepper gas valve with oxygen sensor loopback etc. Unique opportunities for reassigning the I/O functions. Smooth speed control of the cooling fan motor. The ability to edit the main settings and maps in real time (when engine is running) and switching between 2 or 4 sets of maps. And other features and functions (see below).|$|E
5000|$|Ford RS Dealerships {{also offered}} {{a number of}} {{performance}} modifications for the Essex V6 called the GP1 ( [...] Group 1 [...] ) and Series X, the GP1 package offered a Weber 40 DFI5 Carburetor, a camshaft kit, larger 44.5mm inlet and 41.3mm exhaust valves, double valve springs, [...] "specially selected" [...] connecting rods and forged high compression pistons giving a power output of around 170 Hp, the Series X modifications offered the same larger inlet and exhaust valves as the GP1 but also offered a new inlet manifold designed for 3 twin choke Weber 42 DCNF Carburetors fed by an <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> which boosted power up to 185 Hp and 195 lb/ft, however the standard camshaft was retained.|$|E
40|$|For {{lifetime}} verification in automotive components it {{is necessary}} to simulate their operation in test benches that reproduce the conditions of vehicular application, according to the boundary conditions defined in the project. In durability tests of <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> for Otto cycle engines, test benches are often used comprised of fuel tanks made of stainless steel provided with a fuel temperature control system. They also have a hydraulic system that allows simulating the fuel circulation loop of the vehicle consisting of fuel filter and fuel pressure regulator. Moreover, they are also equipped with flow meters and fuel pressure for monitoring the test. It has been observed in test bench durabilities that <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> of Flex <b>Fuel</b> type are likely to present high levels of corrosion on their outer housing, even higher than expected after this kind of test. However this behavior has not been found in automotive vehicles under real conditions of use and after a long period of running, suggesting that the problem lies in the operational conditions of the test bench itself. This paper aims to study the cause of this phenomenon, associated with the ground difference between the bench and the tank of the vehicle, describe it from a theoretical perspective and propose modifications to the settings that best simulate the test vehicle conditions, leading to more reliable results {{at the end of the}} test...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuel system}} is a very simple design. A {{mechanical}} or <b>electric</b> <b>fuel</b> lift <b>pump</b> feeds a Stanadyne Rotary Distributor Injection pump at low pressure. The distributor injection pump controls both metering, via an internal centrifugal governor, and high pressure fuel delivery to the fuel injectors via internal precision hydraulic pumps. Near {{the top of the}} compression stroke fuel is atomized at high pressure into a hemispherical Inconel prechamber in the cylinder heads using Bosch pintle and seat mechanical fuel injectors. This is called Indirect injection. GM used fully mechanical DB2 series injection pumps on all military HMMWVs and 1982-1993 6.2's and 6.5's. From 1994 till end of production GM used the electronically controlled Stanadyne DS4 series of injection pumps in their light trucks. A mechanical DB4 series injection pump can be found on some 6.5L marine engines.|$|R
