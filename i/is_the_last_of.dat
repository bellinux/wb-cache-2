5|$|This {{is a most}} {{important}} building {{for the history of}} Australian architecture, being an extreme example of High Victorian architecture. There were never many hotels of its standard in Australia and to my knowledge this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> them.|$|E
5|$|Half-game {{increments}} {{are possible}} because games can be cancelled due to rain. If a postponed game <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the season between two teams {{in one of}} their stadiums, it may not be made up if it does not affect the playoff race.|$|E
5|$|Nocturne (1958) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the orchestral cycles. As in the Serenade, Britten set {{words by}} {{a range of}} poets, who here include Shakespeare, Coleridge, Keats, Shelley, Tennyson and Wilfred Owen. The whole cycle is darker in tone than the Serenade, with pre-echoes of the War Requiem. All the songs have subtly {{different}} orchestrations, with a prominent obbligato part for a different instrument in each.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{his life}} Smetana {{returned}} to simple song-writing, with five Evening Songs (1879) to words by the poet Vítězslav Hálek. His final completed work, Our Song (1883), <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> four settings of texts by Josef Srb-Debrnov. Despite the state of Smetana's health, this is a happy celebration of Czech song and dance. The piece was lost for many years, and only received its first performance after rediscovery in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Ancient {{seafaring}} {{people were}} aware of the octopus, as evidenced by certain artworks and designs. For example, a stone carving found in the archaeological recovery from Bronze Age Minoan Crete at Knossos (1900 – 1100 BC) has a depiction of a fisherman carrying an octopus. The terrifyingly powerful Gorgon of Greek mythology has been thought to have been inspired by the octopus or squid, the octopus itself representing the severed head of Medusa, the beak as the protruding tongue and fangs, and its tentacles as the snakes. The Kraken are legendary sea monsters of giant proportions said to dwell off the coasts of Norway and Greenland, usually portrayed in art as a giant octopus attacking ships. Linnaeus included it in the first edition of his 1735 Systema Naturae. A Hawaiian creation myth says that the present cosmos <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> a series which arose in stages from the ruins of the previous universe. In this account, the octopus is the lone survivor of the previous, alien universe. The Akkorokamui is a gigantic octopus-like monster from Ainu folklore.|$|E
5|$|Freedom from Fear <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> {{a series}} of four oil {{paintings}} entitled Four Freedoms, painted by Norman Rockwell. The works were inspired by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in a State of the Union Address delivered to the 77th United States Congress on January 6, 1941; the speech itself is often called the Four Freedoms. The Four Freedoms theme was eventually incorporated into the Atlantic Charter, and it {{became part of the}} charter of the United Nations. The series of paintings was printed in The Saturday Evening Post, accompanied by essays from noted writers, on four consecutive weeks in early 1943: Freedom of Speech (February 20), Freedom of Worship (February 27), Freedom from Want (March 6) and Freedom from Fear (March 13). Eventually, the series was widely distributed in poster form and became instrumental in the U.S. Government's Second War Bond Drive.|$|E

It {{included}} Sebring Silver paint, silver 5-spoke alloy wheels, {{and special}} emblems and seat trim. Of the 5,412 built, 4,031 were coupes and 1,381 were convertibles. It cost $1,250 extra.|$|R

5|$|Freedom from Fear <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the {{well-known}} Four Freedoms oil paintings {{produced by the}} American artist Norman Rockwell. The series {{was based on the}} four goals known as the Four Freedoms, which were enunciated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt in his State of the Union Address on January 6, 1941. This work was published in the March 13, 1943, issue of The Saturday Evening Post alongside an essay by a prominent thinker of the day, Stephen Vincent Benét. The painting is generally described as depicting American children being tucked into bed by their parents while the Blitz rages across the Atlantic in Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Seaborgium is {{the fourth}} member of the 6d series of {{transition}} metals and the heaviest member of group 6 in the periodic table, below chromium, molybdenum, and tungsten. All {{the members of the}} group form a diversity of oxoanions. They readily portray their group oxidation state of +6, although this is highly oxidising in the case of chromium, and this state becomes more and more stable to reduction as the group is descended: indeed, tungsten <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the 5d transition metals where all four 5d electrons participate in metallic bonding. As such, seaborgium should have +6 as its most stable oxidation state, both in the gas phase and in aqueous solution, and this is the only oxidation state that is experimentally known for it; the +5 and +4 states should be less stable and the +3 state, the most common for chromium, would be the least stable for seaborgium. Experimental chemical investigation has been hampered due to the need to produce seaborgium one atom at a time, its short half-life, and the resulting necessary harshness of the experimental conditions.|$|E
5|$|The World Cup final match <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the competition, and {{the result}} determines which country is {{declared}} world champions. If after 90 minutes of regular play the score is a draw, an additional 30-minute period of play, called extra time, is added. If such a game is still tied after extra time it is decided by kicks from the penalty shoot-out. The team winning the penalty shoot-out are then declared champions. The tournament has been decided by a one-off match on every occasion except 1950, when the tournament winner was decided by a final round-robin group contested by four teams (Uruguay, Brazil, Sweden, and Spain). Uruguay's 2–1 victory over Brazil was the decisive match (and {{one of the last}} two matches of the tournament) which put them ahead on points and ensured that they finished top of the group as world champions. Therefore, this match is regarded by FIFA as the de facto final of the 1950 World Cup.|$|E

5|$|The {{lift bridge}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> several {{previous}} crossings over the waterway. A wooden swing bridge {{was built in}} 1875. A newer, iron swing bridge was built in 1897; this structure was partially destroyed in 1905 when it {{was struck by a}} ship. This second crossing was rebuilt in 1906 and remained in service until the lift bridge was opened in December 1959. The current bridge was last used for railroad traffic in the summer of 1982, after the Soo Line rail lines north of Houghton were abandoned starting in 1976. The middle section is left in an intermediate position for the warmer nine months of the year so that vehicle traffic can use the lower deck of the lift span and pleasure craft can pass under the bridge. In the winter, the lift span is lowered so snowmobiles and skiers can use the lower deck while cars and trucks use the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|The story {{involved}} a strange force compelling Jamie to pilot the TARDIS to Scotland in 1746 where the Doctor, Jamie and Zoe find themselves isolated from their ship by a forcefield. They {{arrive at the}} foreboding Castle McCrimmon, Jamie's ancestral home near a misty loch. There they are met by Duncan, Factor to the ailing Laird, Sir James McCrimmon. Jamie shows Zoe around and she notices some strange cattle which then stand up - they are Yeti. The Yeti isolate the castle and the villagers fall {{under the influence of}} the Great Intelligence. One villager, Fiona, is immune and Jamie falls in love with her. The Intelligence aims to gain control of Jamie's body and settle in the castle as the Laird of McCrimmon when Sir James dies. The Doctor has to determine who the Intelligence is working through, with the Laird and the village sorceress being the prime candidates. It transpires that Duncan is protecting Fiona's mother, Morag - a woman with second sight. The Intelligence is defeated and, after Sir James dies with no heirs, Jamie <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>of</b> the clan and is therefore the obvious choice for the new Laird. Accepting his rightful inheritance and responsibility, Jamie bids a reluctant farewell to the Doctor and Zoe to remain with Fiona as the new Laird.|$|E
