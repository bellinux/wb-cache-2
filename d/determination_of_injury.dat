40|$|The United States International Trade Commission [USITC or Commission] is an independent, nonpartisan, {{quasi-judicial}} {{federal agency}} established by Congress {{with a wide}} range of trade-related mandates.

40|$|Basketball {{is one of}} the {{top five}} {{participation}} sports for youth athletes in Australia with participation rates on the rise. With increased participation, there is a need for increasing awareness of the importance of the pre-participation examination, including musculoskeletal screening and functional testing as part of a multidisciplinary approach in preventing future injuries. Pre-participation musculoskeletal screening of youth basketball players should assess fundamental movement qualities throughout the kinetic chain with an emphasis on lower-extremity force interplay characteristics, specifically eccentric loading (i. e., such as jump tasks). A simplified basketball-specific musculoskeletal screen may include assessments such as the Functional Hop Test Combination, Landing Error Scoring System, 10 -sec Tuck Jump Assessment, Weight-Bearing Lunge Test and the Star Excursion Balance Test, which place the athlete in positions where weaknesses and imbalances become noticeable if stability and mobility are limited. This will allow easy identification of inefficient and/or compensatory movement tendencies. A basic understanding of musculoskeletal deficits including bilateral strength imbalances, flexibility imbalances, lower crossed syndrome and dominance-related factor are key components in <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> risk. Youth athletes should incorporate neuromuscular training (balance and postural stability) as part of their movement preparation to enhance movement competency while minimizing likelihood of injury. Youth athletes represent a unique population and should undergo pre-participation musculoskeletal screening for identification of movement limitations.

40|$|Brachial plexus injury (BPI) is {{a devastating}} type of nerve injury, {{potentially}} causing loss of motor and sensory function. Principally, BPI is either categorized as preganglionic or post- ganglionic, {{with the early}} establishment of injury level being crucial for choosing the correct treatment strategy. Despite diagnostic advances, {{the need for a}} reliable, non-invasive method for establishing the injury level remains. We studied the usefulness of in vivo mag- netic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spinal cord for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> level. The find- ings were related to neuronal and glial changes. Rats underwent unilateral L 4 & L 5 ventral roots avulsion or sciatic nerve axotomy. The injuries served as models for pre- and postgan- glionic BPI, respectively. MRI of the L 4 /L 5 spinal cord segments 4 weeks after avulsion showed ventral horn (VH) shrinkage on the injured side compared to the uninjured side. Axotomy induced no change in the VH size on MRI. Following avulsion, histological sections of L 4 /L 5 revealed shrinkage in the VH grey matter area occupied by NeuN-positive neurons, loss of microtubular-associated protein- 2 positive dendritic branches (MAP 2), pan-neurofila- ment positive axons (PanNF), synaptophysin-positive synapses (SYN) and increase in immunoreactivity for the microglial OX 42 and astroglial GFAP markers. Axotomy induced no changes in NeuN-reactivity, modest decrease of MAP 2 immunoreactivity, no changes in SYN and PanNF labelling, and a modest increase in OX 42 and SYN labeling. Histological and radiological findings were congruent when assessing changes after axotomy, while MRI somewhat underestimated the shrinkage.

Neurofilament light (NF-L) has been introduced as a marker of neuroaxonal injury in neuroinflammatory/-degenerative diseases. In this study we determined the predictive power of serum (s-) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF-) NF-L levels towards outcome, and explored their potential correlation to diffuse axonal injury (DAI). A total of 182 patients suffering from TBI admitted to the neurointensive care unit at a level 1 trauma center were included. S-NF-L levels were acquired, together with S 100 B and neuron-specific enolase (NSE). CSF-NF-L was measured in a subcohort (n = 84) with ventriculostomies. Clinical and neuro-radiological parameters, including computerized tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging, {{were included in the}} analyses. Outcome was assessed 6 to 12 months after injury using the Glasgow Outcome Score (1 - 5). In univariate proportional odds analyses mean s-NF-L, -S 100 B and -NSE levels presented a pseudo-R- 2 Nagelkerke of 0. 062, 0. 214 and 0. 074 in correlation to outcome, respectively. In a multivariate analysis, in addition to a model including core parameters (pseudo-R- 2 0. 33 towards outcome; Age, Glasgow Coma Scale, pupil response, Stockholm CT score, abbreviated injury severity score, S 100 B), S-NF-L yielded an extra 0. 023 pseudo-R- 2 and a significantly better model (p = 0. 006) No correlation between DAI or CT assessed-intracranial damage and NF-L was found. Our study thus demonstrates that SNF-L correlates to TBI outcome, even if used in models with S 100 B, indicating an independent contribution to the prediction, perhaps by reflecting different pathophysiological processes, not possible to monitor using conventional neuroradiology. Although we did not find a predictive value of NF-L for DAI, this cannot be completely excluded. We suggest furthe...|$|E

This technique {{has been used to}} assess numerous systems, including the mechanical properties of bone, fixation techniques post-fracture and the performance of bone microarchitecture. In this study, a semi-automated process for converting CT data into finite element (FE) models was used to model the mid-shaft (diaphysis) of porcine femoral samples under sub-maximal torsional and compressive load. Physical validation was undertaken to investigate if the all-important geometry and material property mapping functioned correctly. Porcine femoral specimens were imaged using contiguous helical CT, which was converted to FE models using ScanIP from Simpleware, Exeter, UK. The heterogeneous material properties were estimated using density–elasticity relationships proposed in literature for human bone samples. Laboratory testing performed favourably, with a linear strain response validating the use of the array of linear material models used in simulation. The simulation procedure also performed well. Linear regression and mean error calculation demonstrated accurate correlation between predicted (from simulation) and observed (measured within the laboratory) results that offered improvement over the accuracy within comparative testing for human samples. Using FE modelling on a patient-specific basis offers potential in a number of scenarios, including the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> risk and design of protective equipment. The increased accessibility of animal samples allows large-scale fracture testing of complex loading mechanisms and the potential to consider younger animal samples (to investigate the behaviour of developing bone).

40|$|International {{trade in}} fishery {{products}} {{is becoming increasingly}} important. This {{is evidenced by the}} number of international disputes concerning fishery products. Conflicts have arisen between the environment and fish trade, {{as was the case in}} the U. S. -Mexican tuna-dolphin dispute. Disputes have arisen over import regulations. Disputes have also developed over the management of fishery resources within a state 2 ̆ 7 s 200 nautical mile Exclusive Economic Zone. One such disagreement, between the United States and Canada, concerned wild salmon and herring processing regulations. The United States is one of the most important seafood trading countries in the world. This importance is illustrated by the fact that the United States was the world 2 ̆ 7 s second largest importer of seafood products in 1991, importing some 6 billion worth, and the world 2 ̆ 7 s largest exporter of seafood products, exporting 3. 5 billion worth. As the significance of seafood grows, and existing fisheries become depleted, the possibility for conflict between the United States and other seafood trading countries grows. International trade law and practice is a factor materially influencing world fishery production and trade, a better understanding of which is important to help avoid future costly dispute settlement. One of the fish stocks important to the seafood trade of the United States is salmon. U. S. consumers consumed an average of 1. 162 pounds of salmon in 1992, making it the fourth most popular seafood that year. In 1993, the average American consumed 15 pounds of seafood, 0. 99 pounds of which was salmon, the fifth most popular U. S. seafood. The numbers for 1994 were essentially the same. The majority of salmon farmed in the United States comes from Maine. Maine salmon farmers contended with stiff competition from imported Norwegian farmed Atlantic salmon until 1989. In 1990, twenty-one Maine and Washington Atlantic salmon producers formed the Coalition for Fair Atlantic Salmon Trade (FAST), and filed a petition with the U. S. International Trade Commission (USITC) and the U. S. International Trade Administration (USITA) to complain about alleged subsidizing of the Norwegian Atlantic salmon farming industry by the Norwegian government. The petition also alleged that Norwegian Atlantic salmon was being sold at less than fair value in the United States and that this practice was harming the U. S. salmon industry. During its subsequent investigation, the USITA found that the subject imports were being subsidized and were being sold at less than fair value in the United States. The USITC found that these imports were materially injuring the domestic Atlantic salmon farming industry. Therefore, countervailing and antidumping duties were imposed on Norwegian imports of fresh and chilled farmed Atlantic salmon. Norway then appealed these determinations to the U. S. Court of International Trade. This Court determined that the USITC had not properly evaluated a decline in Norwegian imports in 1990. The Court also felt that there was not sufficient evidence to support the USITC <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to the U. S. industry at the time of its final determination. The Court reversed and remanded the final USITC determination because of these deficiencies. The Court of International Trade 2 ̆ 7 s decision forced the USITC to reevaluate and justify its earlier <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> On reconsideration, the USITC found that other factors, namely, the appreciation of the Norwegian kroner to the U. S. dollar, an increase in exports to the European Community, and one exporter 2 ̆ 7 s decrease in exports to the United States, did not account for the decline in subject imports, but that the initiation of its preliminary investigations did. The USITC also explained that it had utilized 1989 import data instead of 1990 data when determining present injury, because the later data would have reflected the reduction in Norwegian imports to the United States resulting from the imposition of the duties. When Norway appealed the final determinations of the USITC and imposition of duties by the USITA to the U. S. Court of International Trade, it also petitioned the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to establish two panels, one to review the U. S. imposition of countervailing duties, the other to look into the U. S. imposition of antidumping duties. GATT agreed to establish the two panels, which each then heard the arguments of the two parties and rendered a decision. The GATT Panel considering the countervailing duty agreed with the United States on all points. The Panel agreed with the determination of the United States, not because its methods had been prescribed by the text of GATT and its side agreements, but because there was no prescribed methodology in the Agreement to use in determining the existence of a subsidy, or in defining what types of programs were countervailable. The United States 2 ̆ 7 <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> was found acceptable in the absence of such explicit criteria, because the United States had explained why it had used 1989 data to determine present injury and not 1990 data. Thus, the lack of a prescribed methodology worked in the favor of the United States. The Panel examining the antidumping duty determination did not wholly agree with the United States. Although the Panel agreed with most of the U. S. practices in the case, it felt the United States had not properly obtained a representative sample of Norwegian salmon farms in determining the relevant cost of production. However, the Panel did not therefore find that the general determination and imposition of duties by the United States was inconsistent with its international obligations. This conclusion was again reached generally because there had not been a prescribed methodology in the GATT. Since the United States had at least considered alternative factors affecting the U. S. industry, and had justified why it used the information it had, U. S. practice was found to be compatible with its international obligations. This dispute, as examined in this article, provides a case study of U. S. international trade law and practice and its compatibility with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The study is designed to answer four primary questions: 1) is U. S. trade law being used as a protectionist measure to protect U. S. industries from unfair foreign competition; 2) is U. S. practice incompatible with international trade law; 3) did the removal of Norwegian Atlantic salmon from the U. S. market open the door for other producer countries; and, 4) was the above opportunity capitalized on by Maine, the initiator of the investigations, or by other producer countries, namely Canada and Chile? Before addressing these questions in light of the U. S. -Norway dispute, the next section will provide some general legal background...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the Commission of the European Community has made Korea one of three main target {{countries}} of anti-dumping measures, because Korea is pressing to export more of the electronics products which the Community is struggling to protect, study of the Community Antidumping Law in Korea has barely begun. Therefore, in this thesis, the measures that may be imposed by Community authorities with respect to trade with countries not members of the European Community, especially with Korea, under the Community Anti-dumping Regulation, {{in the context of the}} GATT Anti-dumping system are explained and analysed. With regard to the Community's anti-dumping rules, protectionist bias in their application is examined, in particular the determination of normal value and export price, constructed normal value and constructed export price, the comparison of normal value and export price, the calculation of dumping margin, and the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> and proposals are made as to the extent to which the Community anti-dumping rules need to be revised to diminish the bias in their range that explicitly favours Community producers and a finding of dumping, in the context of the GATT rules. With regard to the Korean Anti-dumping rules, on the other hand, they are introduced, generally. Anti-dumping measures in Korea have not been applied properly in favour of Korean producers, mainly because of the lack of transparency and institutional inertia. Therefore, enactment of a special Act governing anti-dumping complaints, modelled on a unitary system rather than a bifurcated system, should be considered for the transparent and speedy investigations. Institutional inertia must be rectified, i. e., more precise definition is required in some terminologies, and provisions on cumulation and anti-circumvention should have been prescribed before their application. Through a comparative study of the anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea, it becomes clear that various aspects of the technical methodology applied by the authorities in anti-dumping determinations have a tendency to make findings of dumping largely automatic and inevitable. Therefore, it must always be borne in mind that anti-dumping measures can be imposed only where dumping and resulting injury is actually established, not artificially. This study has looked at anti-dumping laws in the Community and Korea comparatively, in the context of the GATT Anti-dumping rules. The Community refers to GATT and the Code in the preamble of its anti-dumping regulation, which has no binding effect in Court, and adopts the regulation in accordance with existing international obligations, in particular those arising from Article VI of the GATT and from the GATT Anti-dumping Code. However, this does not ensure an interpretation in conformity with GATT rules and its spirit, because the wording of the GATT anti-dumping rules taken literally is very ambiguous and can be interpreted very differently. Therefore, a comparative study with the Community's antidumping rules and its practice as a legislative model should be very helpful, in order to improve the current Korean anti-dumping system, because the GATT anti-dumping rules can play a very limited role only as a guideline...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} {{the area and}} extent <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> in hypoxic encephalopathy stages by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) using parameters apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and fractional anisotropy (FA) values and their comparison with controls without any evidence of asphyxia. To correlate the outcome of hypoxia severity clinically and significant changes on DTI parameter. Materials and Methods: DTI was done in 50 cases at median age of 12 and 20 controls at median age of 7 days. FA and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) were measured in several regions of interest (ROI). Continuous variables were analyzed using Student's t-test. Categorical variables were compared by Fisher's exact test. Comparison among multiple groups was done using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc Bonferroni test. Results: Abnormalities were more easily and accurately determined in ROI {{with the help of}} FA and ADC values. When compared with controls FA values were significantly decreased and ADC values were significantly increased in cases, in ROI including both right and left side of thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior limb of internal capsule, cerebral peduncle, corticospinal tracts, frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital with P value < 0. 05. The extent <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> was maximum in stage-III. There was no significant difference among males and females.

40|$|Background & Objectives: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the protective effects of Crocin on rat high fat diet-induced hepatic steatosis model.   Methods: For this purpose, male rats were given either standard diet as control, high fat diet for induction of hepatic steatosis and high fat diet plus Crocin through gavage at different doses (25, 50 and 100 mg kg- 1 /day) for protection of liver steatosis, at a period of 4 weeks in different experimental groups and compared considering serum lipid profile, serum biomarkers <b>of</b> liver tissue <b>injury,</b> hepatic antioxidant activity and liver histopathological changes. The serum levels of triglyceride, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> deleterious metabolic effects, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> hepatocyte <b>injury,</b> alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin for assessment of biliary function, malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione content for assessment of liver free radical activity, the enzymatic activities of glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase as indicators of antioxidation in liver tissue, were measured. Finally, the biochemical findings were matched with histopathological verifications.   Results: After 4 weeks, high fat diet caused deleterious metabolic effects, including hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia and liver dysfunction. Rats fed high fat diet alone showed increased activities of hepatocellular enzymes in plasma, significant decline in antioxidants, and elevated lipid peroxidation indices in liver. Crocin treatment significantly reduced elevated markers <b>of</b> liver tissue <b>injury</b> and malondialdehyde, and brought back the liver antioxidants and the over accumulation lipids in serum towards normal. Histopathology of the liver confirmed the changes induced by high fat diet and the heptoprotective effect of Crocin.   Conclusions: Crocin exerts protective effects against hepatic steatosis in rats fed with high fat diet possibly through its antioxidant actions...|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{induction}} of prolonged choline-deprivation (CD) in rats receiving thioacetamide (TAA) is {{an experimental}} approach of mild hepatotoxicity that could resemble commonly presented cases in clinical practice (in which states of malnutrition and/or alcoholism are {{complicated by the}} development of other liver-associated diseases). Aim: The present study aimed to investigate the time-dependent effects of a 30 -, a 60 - and a 90 -day dietary CD and/or TAA administration on the adult rat liver histopathology and the serum markers of hepatic functional integrity. Methods: Rats were divided into four main groups: (a) control, (b) CD, (c) TAA and (d) CD + TAA. Dietary CD was provoked through the administration of choline-deficient diet, while TAA administration was performed ad libitum through the drinking water (300 mg/l of drinking water). Results: Histological examination of the CD + TAA liver sections revealed micro- and macro-vesicular steatosis with degeneration and primary fibrosis at day 30, to extensive steatosis and fibrosis at day 90. Steatosis was mostly of the macrovesicular type, involving all zones of the lobule, while inflammatory infiltrate consisted of foci of acute and chronic inflammatory cells randomly distributed in the lobule. These changes were accompanied by gradually increasing mitotic activity, as well as by a constantly high alpha-smooth muscle actin immunohistochemical staining. The <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> hepatocellular <b>injury</b> markers such as the serum enzyme levels’ of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase demonstrated a decrease at day 30 (they returned to control levels at days 60 and 90). However, the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> those serum enzymes used for the assessment <b>of</b> cholestatic liver <b>injury</b> (gamma-glutamyltransferase, alkaline phosphatase) revealed a constant (time-independent) statistically-significant increase versus control values. Conclusions: Long-term combined dietary CD and TAA administration could be a more realistic experimental approach to human liver diseases involving severe steatosis, fibrosis, stellate cell activation and significant regenerative hepatocellular response...|$|R

[Purpose]	 The	 aim	of	 this	 clinical	 study	was	 to	 investigate	 the	benefits	 and	 the	basic	principles	of ultrasonographic {{examination}} in {{the evaluation}} <b>of</b> sciatic nerve <b>injuries.</b> [Subjects and Methods] Patients with sci-atic nerve injury were evaluated using a real-time utrasonographic examination. The capabilty of ultrasonography in terms <b>of</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the type and the localization <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> the position <b>of</b> the proximal and distal nerve segments, {{the presence or absence}} of a neuroma, and perilesional scar tissue were evaluated in all cases. [Results] Ten cases with sciatic nerve injury were evaluated with real time sonography. Perilesional scar tissue formation was found in 4 (40 %) cases. Two (20 %) cases had stump neuroma diagnosed by sonographic examination. The capability of ultrasonographic examination was satisfactory for all evaluation parameters. [Conclusion] Ultrasono-graphic examination of sciatic nerve lesions may be used for the description of the degree <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> complete or incomplete nerve sectioning, the presence of hematoma and foreign body, the continuity <b>of</b> nerve, <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> nerve stumps, formation of perilesional scar tissue, and the presence of neuroma...|$|R
40|$|Background. The exact {{knowledge}} of the anatomic relations of the juvenile skeleton is of great importance for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>injury</b> and proper treatment. The treatment should be uniform and carried out in one act. Considering this facts the functional results are usually very good and no late sequel are recorded. Methods. In 5 -years period 25 children with age 7 to 17 were treated with displaced fracture of ankle. The Salter-Harris classification (SHC) was used. Children were classified in two groups. In first group (G-I) 11 children were treated with closed reduction. Whole group was classified as type II fractures of SHC. In second group (G-II) 14 children were treated operatively. 10 cases were type III, 2 cases were type IV of SHC and 2 were juvenil Tillaux fracture. In follow-up we registered the duration of immobilisation, non-weight bearing period, mobility and residual pain {{at the end of}} the treatment. Results. In G-I average non-weight bearing period was 10. 4 weeks, in G-II only 7. 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment in both groups very good functional results were achieved. There were no complications in operative group (G-II). Conclusions. Children relatively often suffer ankle injuries. With proper diagnosis and early adequate treatment the prognosis is good and no functional sequel were recorded. </p...|$|R

40|$|The law of {{international}} responsibility fulfills essentially two functions: reparation for <b>injury</b> and protection <b>of</b> {{the rule of}} law and global order. Notwithstanding the fundamental difference between these objectives, the law {{of international}} responsibility traditionally has been conceived in unitary norms consisting of a single set of principles that applies to all breaches of rules of international law. With the further development of international law that unity becomes difficult to maintain. On the one hand, there is an increasing need for a further refinement of liability principles for the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> compensation for <b>injury.</b> On the other hand, the process of constitutionalization of international law poses entirely different accountability requirements to which the law of international responsibility should contribute. Maintaining unity may lead to inconsistencies and hinder the refinement of the law of international responsibility that is necessary to deal with the various types of responsibility and accountability issues of modern international law, thereby marginalizing the law of responsibility.
