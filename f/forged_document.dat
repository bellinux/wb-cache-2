2500|$|Common {{criminal}} charges {{involved in a}} document examination case fall into the [...] "white-collar crime" [...] category. These include identity theft, forgery, counterfeiting, fraud, or uttering a <b>forged</b> <b>document.</b> Questioned documents are often important in other contexts simply because documents are used in so many contexts and for so many purposes. For example, a person may commit murder and forge a suicide note. This is an example where a document is produced directly as a fundamental part of a crime. More often a questioned document is simply the by-product of normal day-to-day business or personal activities.|$|E
2500|$|Official {{attempts}} {{to enforce the}} [...] "five nos" [...] included removing public memorials and tearing down posters commemorating his achievements. [...] On 25 March 1976, a leading Shanghai newspaper, Wenhui Bao, published an article stating that Zhou was [...] "the capitalist roader inside the Party [...] wanted to help the unrepentant capitalist roader [...] regain his power". This and other propaganda efforts to attack Zhou's image only strengthened the public's attachment to Zhou's memory. Between March and April 1976, a <b>forged</b> <b>document</b> circulated in Nanjing that claimed itself to be Zhou Enlai's last will. [...] It attacked Jiang Qing and praised Deng Xiaoping, and was met with increased propaganda efforts by the government.|$|E

2500|$|Following the war, Reavis {{traveled}} to Brazil and gained functional fluency in Portuguese. Reavis returned to St. Louis, Missouri {{near the end}} of 1866. There he worked a series of jobs, including streetcar conductor, traveling salesman and clerk at a variety of retail stores. Eventually, he found success as a real estate agent. After several small real estate deals, Reavis saved enough money to open his own office. [...] He then discovered that the skills he learned forging army passes allowed him to adjust real estate paperwork and correct imperfect property titles. In one established instance, he aided in this manner a man seeking to purchase a tract of land near St. Louis. Three generations of documents accumulated by the selling family were unable to establish clear title for the land. Reavis was able to produce a yellowed and fading 18th century document that all previous searches had failed to notice. Accepted as valid by all parties to the transaction, this (<b>forged)</b> <b>document</b> allowed his client to complete the transaction.|$|E
2500|$|Peer Henrik Hansen, {{a scholar}} at Roskilde University, wrote two scathing {{criticisms of the}} book for the International Journal of Intelligence and Counterintelligence and the Journal of Intelligence History, {{describing}} Ganser's work as [...] "a journalistic book with a big spoonful of conspiracy theories" [...] that [...] "fails to present proof of and an in-depth explanation of the claimed conspiracy between USA, CIA, NATO and the European countries." [...] Hansen also criticized Ganser for basing his [...] "claim of the big conspiracy" [...] off US Army Field Manual 30-31B, a Cold War era <b>forged</b> <b>document.</b> Hayden Peake's book review Intelligence in Recent Public Literature maintains that, [...] "Ganser fails to document his thesis that the CIA, MI6, and NATO and its friends turned GLADIO into a terrorist organization." [...] Philip HJ Davies of the Brunel University Centre for Intelligence and Security Studies likewise concludes that the book is [...] "marred by imagined conspiracies, exaggerated notions of the scale and impact of covert activities, misunderstandings of the management and coordination of operations within and between national governments, and... an almost complete failure to place the actions and decisions in question in the appropriate historical context." [...] According to Davies, [...] "the underlying problem is that Ganser has not really undertaken the most basic necessary research {{to be able to}} discuss covert action and special operations effectively." [...] Olav Riste of the Norwegian Institute for Defence Studies, writing for the journal Intelligence and National Security, mentions several instances where his own research on the stay-behind network in Norway was twisted by Ganser and concludes that [...] "a detailed refutation of the many unfounded allegations that Ganser accepts as historical findings would fill an entire book." [...] In a later joint article with Leopoldo Nuti of the University of Rome, the two concluded that the book's [...] "ambitious conclusions {{do not seem to be}} entirely corroborated by a sound evaluation of the sources available." ...|$|E
