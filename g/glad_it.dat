Cohen {{stated that he}} was duped into giving up the rights for the song, but was <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> happened, {{as it would be}} wrong to write a song that was so well-loved and to get rich for it also. After {{performing}} at a few folk festivals, he came to the attention of Columbia Records representative John H. Hammond, who signed Cohen to a record deal. Cohen's first album was Songs of Leonard Cohen (1967). He appeared on BBC TV in 1968 where he sang a duet from the album with Julie Felix.|$|E

Derulo, RedOne, Laila Khayat, Samya Khayat and Sky performed background vocals on the song. The recordings were later mixed by Trevor Muzzy. All instruments and programming {{were provided by}} RedOne, BeatGeek and Slam. In a cover story for the Daily Star, Derulo stated that [...] "Fight for You" [...] was the first song he worked on with RedOne, saying [...] "I'm <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> turned out so dope". On working with RedOne, he said: [...] "Red first became hot when he produced the album The Fame with Lady Gaga. He {{is one of the}} nicest guys I've ever met....RedOne was a nice, humble, down-to-earth, special person".|$|E

500|$|This was actor Cheyenne Jackson's second {{appearance}} as Danny on 30 Rock. He made his {{debut in the}} November 12, 2009, episode [...] "The Problem Solvers". Fey had seen Jackson in the Broadway musicals Xanadu and Damn Yankees, the latter that starred Jane Krakowski, who plays Jenna Maroney on the show. According to Jackson in a November 2009 interview, Fey {{set up a meeting}} to interest him in a role on the program. In an interview with the Los Angeles Times, it was revealed that it was Krakowski who brought Jackson {{to the attention of the}} 30 Rock producers. In the episode, Danny sang off-key during a duet with Jenna, in order to keep her happy. In regards of his off-pitch performance, Jackson said in an interview, [...] "It's actually harder than you might think. I worked on it a lot to make it sound real and to make it sound believable. But I got some good, funny feedback from it, so I'm <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> worked out." ...|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} puzzlement {{expressed}} by several reviewers, including Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal and Votta, {{as to why}} Finn would think Sam {{had been such a}} great performer to begin with that it was so important to bring him back. Despite that, Votta was pleased by Sam's return as was Bell, who thought {{it was one of the}} more enjoyable aspects of the episode. Sam's scene with Blaine, however, was met with criticism, but of Blaine's characterization, not Sam's: BuddyTV John Kubicek pointed out that Blaine [...] "essentially calls Sam a whore" [...] and that [...] "he's like a completely different person". Vicki Hyman of The Star-Ledger described the scene as [...] "pretty out of character" [...] for Blaine, and The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson said that the entire subplot, including Finn's antagonism toward Blaine, was [...] "so sloppily assembled" [...] he was <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> was ended in the following scene. The confrontation between Kurt and Sebastian over Blaine was little remarked on—West enjoyed it, but said she had been hoping for more.|$|E
500|$|Matangi {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted mean rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 78, based on 37 reviews. Jon Blistein of Rolling Stone called the album {{one of her}} strongest efforts. Jim Carroll from The Irish Times hailed M.I.A. as [...] "a musical super-sharpshooter with an incredible ear for hard-bodied pop tracks (Bad Girls, Come Walk With Me, Exodus) that boil and steam the most mutant genres into submission." [...] Gavin Haynes of the NME wrote, [...] "MIA takes the basic template of right-now chart music and subverts it by forcing it to work triple time". He continued, [...] "Beats are constantly morphing, and every track chucks handfuls of sonic debris at you", Likewise, Alexis Petridis of The Guardian noted, [...] "Like the woman who made it, Matangi is hugely inventive and a bit exhausting: if it's hard to take in anything other than small doses, you can't help but be <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> exists". However, Petridis also acknowledged the abrasiveness of the album's sonic scope: [...] "More characteristic is , an unyielding, punishing rhythmic assault on which the only semblance of a tune comes from a distorted electronic horn section". He {{then goes on to}} admit that [...] "in a way, that's the highest compliment you can pay her: a decade into her career, MIA still doesn't sound like anyone else." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Helping Hand" [...] {{received}} overwhelming positive reviews. Of the episode, Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic said, [...] "As I'm {{realizing how}} much I'm thoroughly enjoying the characters on Body of Proof, [...] "Helping Hand" [...] has Megan finally noticing how little she knows about them. The best part is, she does something {{to try and}} change that {{and the results are}} both comical and touching". Orlando praised the scenes between Megan and Curtis, calling them [...] "great" [...] and saying, [...] "Nothing makes you a part of the team like falling for a well-meaning office prank". On the Megan and Bud scenes she said that Megan was [...] "sweet" [...] and [...] "funny" [...] but called her attempts at consoling Bud [...] "clumsy", adding; [...] "Neither completely trusts the other but their growing professional respect has the potential to also become a personal friendship". On this, she said that Bud had some of the best lines in the episode, calling them [...] "the best". She hoped that Peter and Megan's relationship will be explored further and wanted to know [...] "just how these two became partners". Finally, she was <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> was not too [...] "gory" [...] and summarized, [...] "On Body of Proof I'm more interested in the characters than the graphic medical details. Thankfully they continue to give me plenty of what I want". TV OverMind Carissa Pavlica said she was [...] "really enjoying" [...] the relationship between Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan) and Megan. Pavlica explained, [...] "In the Pilot, the other medical examiners seemed to hope they could somehow get rid of Megan by tattling on things to Kate. This week, as she saw Megan struggle in her connection with the living, she attempted to reach out and give advice". Of the plot of the episode, Pavlica said; ...|$|E

But it never seems content to turn over old ground." [...] Trevor Johnston of Time Out gave the film four stars out of five, writing [...] "It has enough of the right stuff to haunt the {{imagination}} long after the immediate buzz of its fluffy-furred cuteness has melted away. For a mere prequel, that's a result." [...] Steven Rea of The Philadelphia Inquirer gave the film three stars out of four and said it [...] "is cute, and funny, and the animation, though not exactly inspired, is certainly colorful." [...] Jake Coyle of Associated Press gave the film three stars out of four, saying it [...] "might not be as gifted as some of its other movies, but sometimes it's alright to be OK." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave the film three stars out of four, and said [...] "It's all infectious fun, despite the lack of originality. In the art of tickling funny bones, Crystal and Goodman earn straight A's." [...] Richard Corliss of Time gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "This minor film with major charms still deserves to have kids dragging their parents to the multiplex for one more peek at the monsters in the closet. With Pixar, familiarity breeds content." [...] Bill Goodykoontz of The Arizona Republic gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of five and said it is [...] "one of those movies that has absolutely no reason to exist, but once you've seen it, you're kind of <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> does." [...] Alan Scherstuhl of The Village Voice gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "Monsters University feels not like the work of artists eager to express something but like that of likable pros whose existence depends on getting a rise out the kids. It's like the scares Sully and Mike spring on those sleeping tykes: technically impressive but a job un-anchored to anything more meaningful." ...|$|E

2500|$|Coe {{began his}} {{performing}} career playing with Humphrey Lyttelton's band from 1957 to 1962. In 1965 {{he was invited}} to join Count Basie's band ('I'm <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> didn't come off – I would have lasted about a fortnight') and has since played with the John Dankworth Orchestra, the Kenny Clarke-Francy Boland Big Band, Derek Bailey's free improvisation group Company, Stan Tracey, Michael Gibbs, Stan Getz, Dizzy Gillespie and Bob Brookmeyer, and performed under Pierre Boulez as well as leading a series of groups of his own, including Coe Oxley & Co with drummer Tony Oxley. He played clarinet on Paul McCartney's recording of [...] "I'll Give You A Ring", released in 1982, and saxophone on John Martyn's 1973 album Solid Air.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the public}} release {{may have been}} a mistake, Tancharoen was <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> {{happened}} the way he did. [...] He saw the positive response coming from fans and realized the power of social networking in helping small-time directors gain a following to take to film studio executives. Armed with the favorable fan reception, Tancharoen met with Warner Bros. executives, who stopped short of green-lighting a major motion picture, but agreed to fund a web series based on the Mortal Kombat franchise. The final step was convincing Ed Boon, co-creator of the franchise and executive producer at NetherRealm Studios, who had just produced the latest video game installment, to agree to the series. Boon was impressed with Mortal Kombat: Rebirth, but not entirely sold on Tancharoen's re-imagined vision. After he met with Tancharoen, Boon was surprised by his enthusiasm for the franchise and quickly offered his support.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{received}} positive reviews upon {{release and}} currently holds a 91% [...] "Fresh" [...] rating {{on the website}} Rotten Tomatoes with an average rating of 7.7/10. Roger Ebert gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, writing that the film [...] "provides a good time, high style, a loving salute to an earlier period of filmmaking". The New York Times chief critic of the era, Vincent Canby, pointed out that [...] "had Dame Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express been made into a movie 40 years ago (when it was published here as [...] "Murder on the Calais Coach"), it would have been photographed in black-and-white on a back lot in Burbank or Culver City, with one or two stars and a dozen character actors and studio contract players. Its running time would have been around 67 minutes and {{it could have been a}} very respectable B-picture. Murder on the Orient Express wasn't made into a movie 40 years ago, and after you see the Sidney Lumet production that opened yesterday at the Coronet, you may be both surprised and <b>glad</b> <b>it</b> wasn't. An earlier adaptation could have interfered with plans to produce this terrifically entertaining super-valentine to a kind of whodunit that may well be one of the last fixed points in our inflationary universe." ...|$|E
