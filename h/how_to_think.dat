25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} of the optimistic bias is that people know more about themselves than they do about others. While individuals know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about themselves as a single person, they still think of others as a generalized group, which leads to biased estimates and inabilities to sufficiently understand their target or comparison group. Likewise, when making judgments and comparisons about their risk compared to others, people generally ignore the average person, but primarily focus on their own feelings and experiences.|$|E
500|$|Lesser {{reported}} in his 1974 book, , written {{to document the}} development of the show and the CTW, that {{one of the goals of}} the show's creators was [...] "the fundamental purpose of preparing children for school". [...] They were aware of the [...] "individual suffering and frustration" [...] of the child who was ill-prepared for the demands of school, so they sought to instill in their young viewers an appetite for learning. Two related goals were providing their viewers with basic educational skills, which Lesser insisted was valuable to inner-city parents, and teaching children both what and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> [...] The show's creators decided to only include in their curriculum the range of skills of the three to five-year-old child, and not focus on skills they already had, or on skills beyond their reach.|$|E

500|$|Speaking {{about the}} role his {{education}} had in shaping his humor, Blumenfeld said: [...] "I went to Jewish schools growing up and that's where my sense of humor was cultivated. Everybody was funny." [...] Blumenfeld has said he is influenced by television programs that he watched while growing up, including The Simpsons, Seinfeld, and Saturday Night Live, which he says [...] "taught me <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> ... absurdly ... creatively and originally about jokes that people were making" [...] and make [...] "jokes on jokes". He has cited Larry David as an influence, and also likes Louie and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Blumenfeld has compared the NBC series The Office and Parks and Recreation to Jake and Amir, saying they [...] "have these office workplace dynamics and the situations are funny and the characters are very funny".|$|E

2500|$|Writer Albert Jay Nock {{wrote that}} Lane and Paterson's nonfiction works were [...] "the only intelligible {{books on the}} {{philosophy}} of individualism that have been written in America this century."

2500|$|In a Vulture interview, Shyamalan {{argued that}} his style and art-form of {{storytelling}} {{resulted in the}} negative reviews of the film and compared it to asking a painter to change to a different style: [...] "I bring as much integrity to the table as humanly possible.

2500|$|Her use of {{repetition}} is ascribed to her search for {{descriptions of the}} [...] "bottom nature" [...] of her characters, such as in The Making of Americans where the narrator is described through the repetition of narrative phrases such as [...] "As I was saying" [...] and [...] "There will be now a history of her." [...] Stein used many Anglo-Saxon words and avoided words with [...] "too much association". Social judgement is absent in her writing, so the reader is given the power to decide <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> and feel about the writing. Anxiety, fear and anger are also absent, and her work is harmonic and integrative.|$|E

2500|$|Gable's {{marriage}} in 1939 to his third wife, actress Carole Lombard (1908–1942), was the happiest period {{of his personal}} life. They met while filming 1932's No Man of Her Own, when Lombard was still married to actor William Powell, but their romance did not take off until 1936. They became reacquainted at a party and soon were inseparable, cited in fan magazines and tabloids as an official couple. Gable thrived being around Lombard's youthful, charming, and frank personality, once stating, [...] "You can trust that little screwball with your life or your hopes or your weaknesses, and she wouldn't even know <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about letting you down." [...] Lombard, for her part, seemed to gain personal stability and a contented home life that she had previously lacked. She taught herself how to hunt and fish and accompanied Gable on trips with his hunting companions.|$|E
