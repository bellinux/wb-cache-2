40|$|BackgroundSome {{adolescents}} {{have special}} health care needs. Privacy concerns, unawareness or ethnical/cultural factors are barriers <b>to</b> women <b>visiting</b> obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs). The utilization of OB/GYN services by adolescent girls is seldom reported. The {{aim of this}} study was to investigate the pattern and consequences of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> OB/GYNs by adolescent girls within the National Health Insurance in Taiwan. MethodsFrom the 1 -million cohort dataset of the National Health Insurance Research Database spanning from 1996 to 2007, adolescent girls visiting OB/GYNs for the first time were identified. The characteristics of <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> were analyzed. Their follow-up visits and admissions within 1 year after their <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> OB/GYNs were traced. ResultsIn 2006, only 5. 8 % (n = 2, 682) of 46, 582 adolescent girls in our study cohort had their <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> OB/GYNs: 46. 7 % with diagnoses of menstrual disorders and 14. 8 % with diagnoses related to inflammatory or infectious diseases of the genital organs. The examination most frequently ordered was pregnancy test (for 19. 9 % of these <b>first</b> <b>visits).</b> Very few (0. 4 %) <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> were for preventive services. Among the infrequent admissions (85 admissions of 75 girls) to obstetric/gynecology wards within 1 year after <b>first</b> <b>visits,</b> the majority (74 of 85 admissions) were pregnancy-related. ConclusionThe leading motivating factor for <b>first</b> <b>visits</b> <b>to</b> OB/GYNs by adolescent girls was menstrual disorders. The majority of subsequent admissions were pregnancy-related, indicating that adolescent pregnancy deserves further attention...|$|R
