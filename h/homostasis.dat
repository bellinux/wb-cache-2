40|$|Over recent years, {{metabolic}} {{disorders such as}} type 2 diabetes {{have finally}} become recognized as a major challenge to global health. The attention of scientists therefore has to focus on improving {{our understanding of the}} molecular mechanisms behind these diseases and towards the design of new drug therapy strategies. The pathophysiology of diabetes is undoubtedly complex, oftentimes characterized by varying states of insulin resistance and impaired b-cell function; however, the identification of new pathways is constantly improving our understanding of the disease. We and others have recently shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) can play a role in insulin secretion and glucose <b>homostasis.</b> Thus, in this review, we will discuss the potential role of miRNAs in type 2 diabetes and related metabolic diseases...|$|E
40|$|Most {{of cases}} of chronic {{subdural}} hematomas are satisfactorily managed by burr hole or trephine opening and drainage. However, several unfavorable cases treated by these methods have been reported. The authors had recently experienced seven cases of chronic subdural hematoma in which a large craniotomy was performed. We think that large craniotomy would be recommended in following five circumstances; 1) when solid clots cannot be successfully removed through burr hole 2) organized hematoma 3) when recurrent intractable hematoma is still present despite several attempts at burr hole drainage 4) when <b>homostasis</b> is difficult through burr hole 5) when chronic subdural hematoma is accompanied by other intracranial lesion in the same area. In 1), 3) and 4), hematoma cavity sometimes contains multiple loculations. Unusual mixed density was observed by computed tomographic scan in six of seven cases...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} suggests that common environmental contaminants can act as endocrine disrupters in fish. However, current data are biased towards environmental estrogens, highlighting the need to elucidate potential pollutant impact on other endocrine axes. Here, we report a highthroughput assay to identify chemicals interacting with piscine peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). Our transactivation assay employs a fish cell line and uses recombinant proteins combining the yeast Gal 4 DNA-binding domain with the ligand-binding domain of PPARs from plaice. Compared to assays with full-length PPARs, this approach circumvents interaction of chemicals binding to retinoid X receptors, which form heterodimers with PPAR and many other nuclear receptors. Plaice PPARa and PPARb are activated by fibrate drugs and by phthalate monoesters at concentrations similar to those activating the homologous mammalian receptors. In line with their assumed role as central transcriptional regulators of energy <b>homostasis,</b> a number of fatty acids activate plaice PPARa and PPARb. In contrast, tributyl tin oxide (TBTO) is a potent antagonist of PPARa and PPARb, showing activity at environmentally relevant concentrations of TBTO (1 - 50 nM). Given the ubiquitous and persistent nature of TBTO, the possibility that chronic environmental effects are occurring via disruption of PPAR signalling in fish should be further investigated.

40|$|This randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, 8 week trial {{assessed}} the efficacy on metabolic changes {{produced by a}} consumption {{of a combination of}} bioactive food ingredients (epigallocatechin gallate, capsaicins, piperine and l-carnitine) versus a placebo, as part of a therapeutic 'lifestyle change' diet, in 86 overweight subjects. Forty-one patients (2 / 14 F/M; age 43. 7 ± 8. 5; BMI 30. 3 ± 3. 5 kg/m 2) were randomized to the supplemented group and 45 (29 / 16; age 40. 7 ± 10. 2; BMI 30. 0 ± 2. 7) to the control group. We observed that consumption of the dietary supplement was associated with a significantly greater decrease in insulin resistance, assessed by <b>homostasis</b> model assessment (p < 0. 001), leptin/adiponectin ratio (p < 0. 04), respiratory quotient (p < 0. 008). LDL-cholesterol levels (p < 0. 01). Moreover, statistically significant differences were recorded between the two groups in relation to urinary norepinephrine levels (p < 0. 001). Leptin, ghrelin, C-reactive protein decreased and resting energy expenditure increased significantly in the supplemented group (p < 0. 05, 0. 03, 0. 02 and 0, 02 respectively), but not in the placebo group; adiponectin decreased significantly in the placebo group (0. 001) but not in the supplemented group, although no statistical significance between the groups was elicited. BMI, fat mass (assessed by DXA) and vascular endothelial growth factor significantly decreased, whilst the resting energy expenditure/free fat mass significantly increased in both groups. In general, a greater change was recorded in the supplemented group compared to the placebo, although no statistically significant {{difference between the two groups}} was recorded. These results suggest that the combination of bioactive food ingredients studied might be useful for the treatment of obesity-related inflammatory metabolic dysfunctions. © 2012 The Author(s) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{vascular}} endothelium {{is essential to}} maintain normal vascular <b>homostasis</b> and its dysfunction is a hallmark of atherosclerosis development. Up-regulated by laminar flow, the transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF 2) is a crucial integrator for maintaining multiple endothelial functions, including anti-inflammation, anti-thrombosis, vasodilatation, and anti-angiogenesis. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which KLF 2 is regulated by different flow pattern, I examined the regulation of KLF 2 expression at both transcriptional level and post-transcriptional level response to different flow pattern. In {{the first part of}} the study, I demonstrated that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is necessary and sufficient to regulate the expression of PS-induced KLF 2 and its downstream (eNOS and ET- 1). In addition, I found PS induced the phosphorylation of ERK 5 and MEF 2, which regulates the KLF 2 expression, is AMPK-dependent in ECs. Furthermore, the phosphorylation levels of ERK 5 and MEF 2, as well as the expression of KLF 2, were significantly reduced in the aorta of AMPK&# 61537; 2 knockout mice when compared with wild-type control mice. These findings suggest that AMPK/ERK 5 /MEF 2 is a functional signaling for the regulation of KLF 2 transcription. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are non-coding small RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In the second part, I examined the role of miRNAs, particularly miR- 92 a, in the atheroprotective flow-regulated KLF 2. Fistly, I found KLF 2 is regulated by miRNA by knockdown Dicer with siRNA. miR- 92 a directly binds to KLF 2 3 'UTR and inhibit its mRNA level and protein level. Subsequent studies revealed that, atheroprotective laminar flow downregulated the level of miR- 92 a to induce KLF 2, and the level of this flow-induced KLF 2 was reduced by pre- 92 a. Consistent with these findings, miR- 92 a level was lower in the endothelium of atheroprotective than atheroprone areas of the mouse aorta. Furthermore, mouse carotid arteries receiving pre- 92 a exhibited impaired vasodilatory response to flow. Collectively, my study suggests that atheroprotective flow patterns decrease the level of miR- 92 a, which in turn increases KLF 2 expression to maintain endothelial homeostasis...|$|E
