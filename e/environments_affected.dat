These methods are hard to implement in radio frequency IPSs because very accurate timers are needed to reach an acceptable accuracy. Furthermore, within <b>environments</b> <b>affected</b> by multipath, the detection of time of arrival is accurate only for very large signal bandwidths.

Analysis of weight loss showed relatively slow decomposition rates in both environments (0. 0047 d- 1 and 0. 0048 d- 1 respectively). Over a 45 -day period we observed significant changes (p < 0. 05) in concentrations of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, but only carbon differed between the environments (F = 10. 479; p = 0. 03).

30|$|The use {{of visual}} {{features}} in audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) is justified {{by both the}} speech generation mechanism, which is essentially bimodal in audio and visual representation, and by the need for features that are invariant to acoustic noise perturbation. As a result, current AVSR systems demonstrate significant accuracy improvements in <b>environments</b> <b>affected</b> by acoustic noise. In this paper, we describe the use of two statistical models for audio-visual integration, the coupled HMM (CHMM) and the factorial HMM (FHMM), and compare the performance of these models with the existing models used in speaker dependent audio-visual isolated word recognition. The statistical properties of both the CHMM and FHMM allow to model the state asynchrony of the audio and visual observation sequences while preserving their natural correlation over time. In our experiments, the CHMM performs best overall, outperforming all the existing models and the FHMM.|$|E

40|$|This work {{advances}} {{the understanding}} of compensation demanded for environmental impacts on atmosphere, lakes and rivers, soil, and ocean generated by mining, urban, fishing and agriculture activities. Our aims are to determine whether compensation demanded depends on the standard variables used {{in the field of}} risk perception (as perceived risk, public acceptability and trust in regulating authorities), and to explore whether these relationships depend on the <b>environment</b> <b>affected</b> and on the economic activity generating the impacts. General Linear Models were used to analyze survey responses from 427 citizens of Santiago, Chile. Results showed that compensation demanded depends on perceived risk, acceptability, and on the economic activity, but not on the <b>environment</b> <b>affected.</b> Acceptability depends on trust in authorities, on perceived risk and on the economic activity. Perceived risk depends on trust, the economic activity and the <b>environment</b> <b>affected.</b> Overall, environmental impacts from the mining industry are perceived as riskier, less acceptable, and have a higher compensation demanded than those generated by the other sectors. These results suggest that to achieve sustainable development, regulations should consider not only environmental impacts but also the economic activity originating them...|$|R

Experiments have been performed to investigate the phase associations of selenium in contaminated sediments under a range of controlled redox conditions. In this study, Se sediment associations were examined using the BCR sequential extraction technique after stabilisation at different redox states. It was shown that {{although most of the}} sediment-bound Se is associated with the operationally- defined 'organic/sulfide' fraction, as the measured redox potential of the system is increased, more Se moves into the 'exchangeable' and 'iron/manganese oxyhydroxide' fractions. In these fractions, contaminants can be expected to be more bioavailable. As the mass of Se absorbed to sediments is typically at least an order of magnitude higher than the mass dissolved in porewaters, significant Se exposure may result from oxidative shifts in Se associations...|$|E

We report about a laboratory experiment whose participants judg-mentally forecast three time series subject to regime switches. The participants make forecasts without context knowledge and without support from statistical software. Their forecasts are only based on the previous realizations of the time series. Our interest is the explanation of the average forecasts with a simple model, the bounds & likelihood heuristic. In previous studies it was shown that this model can explain average forecasting behavior very well given stable and stationary time series. We find that the forecasts after a structural break are characterized by a higher variance and less accuracy over several periods. Con-sidering this transition phase in the model, the heuristic performs even slightly better than the Rational Expectations Hypothesis...|$|E
