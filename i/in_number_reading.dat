40|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that in spatial neglect, placing the patient in a supine position and performing tasks in the dark would reduce the rightward bias in line bisection and cancellation tasks. However, these findings remain debated and have not been extended to other tasks such as reading or visual exploration. Here, in the same study, we examined the effect of body position (BP) and visual environment (VE) on relatively ecological tests of spatial neglect. Among 17 patients with right-hemisphere stroke, 12 were neglect and five were non-neglect in clinical tests. They were compared with 12 healthy control participants in four tasks: line bisection, text reading, number reading, and visual exploration. Tasks were performed on a computer screen in two BP (sitting and supine) and two VE (light and dark) conditions. We found that placing patients in darkness reduced contralesional omissions in the visual exploratory task and, to a smaller extent, <b>in</b> <b>number</b> <b>reading.</b> Conversely, the supine position did not influence performance, and even resulted in cognitive slowing, especially in reading. In conclusion, we confirmed that reducing visual information can improve performance, but only to a limited extent. This justifies strict control of peripheral visual information when exploring neglect patients. Conversely, positioning neglect patients in the supine position can have a discrete negative effect on cognitive functioning, and this effect {{must be taken into account}} during therapy...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND—Progress in the {{treatment}} of breathlessness at rest or on minimum exertion in patients with cancer requires a practical and valid method of measuring symptoms. A study was undertaken to explore the practicality, repeatability, and sensitivity of <b>reading</b> <b>numbers</b> as a form of exercise test in this group of patients.  METHODS—Thirty patients with cancer and 30 age matched healthy subjects <b>read</b> <b>numbers</b> aloud as quickly and clearly as they could for 60 seconds. After five readings the maximum <b>number</b> of <b>numbers</b> <b>read</b> and the <b>number</b> <b>read</b> per breath was noted. This procedure was carried out twice in one day and one week later to assess within and between day repeatability. The sensitivity of the test was assessed by making measurements in 13 patients with cancer before and after drainage of their pleural effusion.  RESULTS—The concept was easily understood by all subjects. Twelve patients were unable to complete five readings in all tests due to tiredness. Compared with control subjects patients <b>read</b> fewer <b>numbers</b> <b>in</b> the three tests (87 - 89 % of control) and fewer numbers per breath (59 - 60 % of control). Repeatability was good both within and between days. After drainage of their effusion all patients were less breathless and there was an increase in both the maximum <b>number</b> of <b>numbers</b> <b>read</b> (23 %) and the <b>number</b> <b>read</b> per breath (60 %).  CONCLUSIONS—The <b>number</b> of <b>numbers</b> <b>read</b> and the <b>number</b> <b>read</b> per breath over 60 seconds was practical, easy to carry out, showed good repeatability within and between days and was sensitive to the improvement seen following drainage of a pleural effusion. It may be a useful measure of the limiting effect of breathlessness in this group of patients. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt is {{commonly}} assumed that <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> can be intact {{in patients with}} pure alexia, and that this dissociation between letter/word recognition and <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> strongly constrains theories of visual word processing. A truly selective deficit in letter/word processing would strongly {{support the hypothesis that}} there is a specialized system or area dedicated to the processing of written words. To date, however, {{there has not been a}} systematic review of studies investigating <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> pure alexia and so the status of this assumed dissociation is unclear. We review the literature on pure alexia from 1892 to 2010, and find no well-documented classical dissociation between intact <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> and impaired letter identification in a patient with pure alexia. A few studies report strong dissociations, with <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> less impaired than letter reading, but when we apply rigorous statistical criteria to evaluate these dissociations, the difference in performance across domains is not statistically significant. There is a trend in many cases of pure alexia, however, for <b>number</b> <b>reading</b> to be less affected than letter identification and word reading. We shed new light on this asymmetry by showing that, under conditions of brief exposure, normal participants are also better at identifying digits than letters. We suggest that the difference observed in some pure alexic patients may possibly reflect an amplification of this normal difference in the processing of letters and digits, and we relate this asymmetry to intrinsic differences between the two types of symbols...|$|R

Experiment 1 tested reading aloud of words and numbers, and Experiment 2 tested same-different decisions <b>in</b> words and <b>numbers.</b> The findings indicated that whereas the participants with developmental LPD showed {{a large number of}} migration errors in reading words, 10 of them <b>read</b> <b>numbers</b> well, without migration errors, and not differently from the control participants. A closer inspection of the pattern of errors <b>in</b> words and <b>numbers</b> of two individuals who had migrations <b>in</b> both <b>numbers</b> and words showed qualitative differences in the characteristics of migration errors in the two types of stimuli.

Five colostrum deprived neonate Holstein calves were inoculated with BVDV (challenged) and 4 were mock challenged (control). Serum from all calves was collected at four different times: prior to challenge (day 0) and at 4, 9, and 16 days post-challenge.
