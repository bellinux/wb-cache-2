5|$|The Drug in Me <b>Is</b> <b>You</b> was speculated by news source Perez Hilton to sell {{anywhere}} from 17,000 to 20,000 copies in the United States {{during its first}} week of sales, placing it close behind predicted debuting chart toppers Eric Church (Chief), Kelly Rowland (Here I Am), and Joss Stone (LP1). The album ended up selling 18,120 copies in its first week in the United States, charting at number 19 on the Billboard 200. This almost exactly matched the first week sales of Escape the Fate (2010), the third album by Radke's former band, though Escape the Fate only charted at number 25, six spots lower than The Drug in Me <b>Is</b> <b>You,</b> despite equal sales. In its second week on sales, The Drug in Me <b>is</b> <b>You</b> dropped about 70% in the United States, selling 5,870 copies. This dropped the album 60 spots to number 79 on the Billboard 200, and brought total US sales for the album to around 24,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|All I Want <b>Is</b> <b>You</b> was {{eventually}} released on November 30, 2010, selling poorly at first. With {{the help of}} its subsequent singles, the album became sleeper hit on the Billboard 200 and sold 404,000 copies by September 2012. It also received positive reviews; critics found some of the music inconsistent but praised Miguel's singing/songwriting abilities while drawing comparisons to American recording artist Prince. Miguel toured in promotion of the album as a supporting act for the singers Usher and Trey Songz.|$|E

5|$|All I Want <b>Is</b> <b>You</b> was {{released}} by Bystorm Entertainment and Jive, on November 30, 2010. It sold poorly at first; in its first week, the album charted at number 109 on the Billboard 200 and sold 11,000 copies in the United States. After falling off the chart for three weeks, it re-entered and climbed the chart for 22 weeks, before peaking at number 37 on May 14, 2011. The album became a sleeper hit, and by September 2012, it had sold 404,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan.|$|E

5|$|The Drug in Me <b>Is</b> <b>You</b> is {{the debut}} studio album by American rock band Falling in Reverse. Production for the album took place {{following}} lead singer Ronnie Radke's departure from Escape the Fate in 2008. Recording {{took place in}} December 2010 and lasted until February 2011 at Paint it Black Studios in Orlando, Florida. Michael Baskette, who worked with Radke on Escape the Fate's Dying is Your Latest Fashion, returned as the executive producer for the album, alongside former bandmate Omar Espinosa and others as additional composers and production aids in the studio. The Drug in Me <b>Is</b> <b>You</b> was released on July 25, 2011, in Europe and Japan, and on July 26, 2011, in the United States.|$|E

5|$|The album charted {{at number}} 19 on the US Billboard 200, selling 18,000 copies {{in its first}} week in the United States. It also charted inter{{national}}ly on the national album charts in Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom. Upon release, The Drug in Me <b>Is</b> <b>You</b> received mixed reviews. Critics consistently noted the contrast between hardcore music and pop music on the tracks, but to mixed reception. Overall, the lyrics were viewed as being cliché while Radke's singing and return to making music were noted. In addition, critics focused on the bitter relationship between Radke and his former band, Escape the Fate, in which reviewers noticed the choice to attack the band {{in many of the}} album's tracks. The Drug in Me <b>Is</b> <b>You</b> was chosen by the Guitar World magazine as the album number 21 among the top 50 albums of 2011.|$|E
5|$|After it was shelved by Jive Records for two years, Miguel {{released}} his debut album All I Want <b>Is</b> <b>You</b> in November 2010. It sold poorly {{at first and}} was underpromoted by Jive, amid the label's dissolution. However, as its singles attained radio airplay and Miguel toured in its promotion, the album became a sleeper hit and helped him garner an audience and commercial standing. He also garnered a following with his fervent concert performances. After Jive was shut down and absorbed by RCA Records, Miguel acquired a new marketing team to develop himself {{as more than a}} typical urban artist, having felt pigeonholed into being marketed as one by Jive. He said that the experience of balancing creativity and business sense on his first album made him more confident in his approach on Kaleidoscope Dream.|$|E

You can take on the affectations and the postures of other places and even learn to speak their ways. But the truth is, home is between your teeth.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, Miguel {{was signed}} to Jive Records-imprint label ByStorm Entertainment. He {{subsequently}} recorded All I Want <b>Is</b> <b>You,</b> but legal issues {{with his former}} production company prevented the album from being released for two years. Miguel continued working with various underground acts and writing songs for mainstream recording artists, including Johnson, Asher Roth, Jaheim, and Usher. Recording sessions for the album took place at Black Mango Studios in Van Nuys, California, Germano Studios in New York City, Glenwood Studios and Instrument Zoo in Miami, Florida, Studio 609 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and The Gym in Los Angeles, California.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{conceived}} as a double album, the band's debut was originally going to contain one disc of post-hardcore and another with pop punk. This was eventually scrapped in favor for a single album, soon confirmed to be titled, The Drug in Me <b>Is</b> <b>You.</b> The band also confirmed that Radke's friend, Michael Baskette, who had previously worked on Blessthefall's album Witness and Escape the Fate's debut Dying is Your Latest Fashion (which was also with Radke), would produce the album. Radke announced that the album would be released in 2011 by Epitaph Records, Radke's former label with Escape the Fate. The album was slated for a July 26, 2011 release date, with pre-orders scheduled for June 7.|$|E

Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne were his most frequent collaborators on disc from 1939 to 1952—a partnership that produced four million-selling singles: Pistol Packin' Mama, Jingle Bells, Don't Fence Me In, and South America, Take it Away. They made one film appearance together in Road to Rio singing You Don't Have to Know the Language, and sang together countless times on radio shows throughout the 1940s and 1950s. They appeared as guests on each other's shows quite often, {{as well as on}} many shows for the Armed Forces Radio Service during and after World War II.
