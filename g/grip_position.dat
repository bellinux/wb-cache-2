40|$|In {{this study}} the {{influence}} of the <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> (crimp grip vs. slope <b>grip</b> <b>position)</b> on the pulley system of the finger was investigated. For this purpose 21 cadaver finger (11 hands, 10 donors) were fixed into an isokinetic loading device. Nine fingers were loaded in the slope <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> and 12 fingers in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position.</b> The forces in the flexor tendons and at the fingertip were recorded. A rupture of the A 4 pulley occurred most often in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> (50 %) but did not occur in the slope <b>grip</b> <b>position,</b> in which alternative events were the most common (67 %). The forces in the deep flexor tendon (FDP) (slope grip: 371 N, crimp grip: 348 N) and at the fingertip (slope grip: 105 N, crimp grip: 161 N) were not significantly different between the 2 finger positions, but the forces acting on the pulleys were higher in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> (A 2 pulley: 287 N, A 4 pulley: 226 N) than in the slope <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> (A 2 pulley: 121 N, A 4 pulley: 103 N). The crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> may be the main cause for A 4 pulley ruptures but the slope <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> may be hazardous for other injuries as the forces recorded in the flexor tendons and at the fingertip were comparable at the occurrence of a terminal event...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{study the}} {{configuration}} of the proximal interphalangeal joint volar plate (VP) in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> (metacarpophalangeal joint at 0 ° to 45 ° flexion, proximal interphalangeal joint at 90 ° to 100 ° flexion, and distal interphalangeal joint at 0 ° to 10 ° hyperextension) using magnetic resonance imaging techniques in healthy volunteers and cadaver fingers and to compare the results with histological sections. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was performed on 24 fingers of 8 healthy volunteers and 12 fingers of 4 embalmed cadaver hands in the neutral position and in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position.</b> The translation of the VP body relative to the middle phalanx base during finger flexion was measured. In 6 of 12 cadaver specimens, a load of 10 N was applied to the flexor tendons to examine how this would affect the histological VP fiber configuration. RESULTS: When the flexor tendons were under load in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position,</b> the volunteers' VP body was translated an average of 3. 2 mm, and the cadaver fingers' VP body was translated an average of 3. 0 mm, relative to the middle phalanx base in a distal direction. Histological analysis of the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> revealed reversing fibers in the VP insertion {{at the base of the}} middle phalanx when the flexor tendons were under load and the VP body was translated. When no load was applied in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position,</b> no translation of the VP body occurred. CONCLUSIONS: This article describes a VP translation in a distal direction relative to the middle phalanx base in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> when the flexor tendons are under load. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: A more precise knowledge of the histological properties of the proximal interphalangeal joint VP during finger flexion can be expected to provide greater diagnostic capabilities and can lead to a better comprehension of injuries...|$|E

In this contribution, MIMO performances of three multiple-antenna configurations for smart phones are investigated in an urban macrocellular environment, based on an extensive MIMO measurement campaign at 2. 65 GHz. The smart phones were held in a two-hand user <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> and both downlink noise- and interference-limited scenarios were evaluated. Our results show that, overall along the test route, the capacity performances are dictated by the power of the communication links. Nevertheless, locally, the multipath richness of the communication channel can have a significant impact on the capacity performances. In addition to the terminal antenna configurations, spatial and cross polarization references were also utilized to further illustrate the importance of multipath richness in both the desired and the interference channels. Moreover, the differences in the local capacity performances along the route for the three antenna configurations give a first indication of the potential benefit in implementing reconfigurable multiple antennas. If switching for maximum capacity is applied between the terminal antenna configurations in the two-hand <b>grip</b> <b>position,</b> average capacity improvements of up to 17 % and 30 % for local 20 m route sections are observed in the noise- and the interference-limited scenarios, respectively...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: The correct {{diagnosis}} of an A 3 pulley rupture is challenging for musculoskeletal radiologists. An A 3 pulley rupture should in theory influence {{the shape of}} the proximal interphalangeal joint volar plate (VP) and the amount of bowstringing at level of the VP during finger flexion. The {{purpose of this study was}} to perform MRI with metric analysis of the VP configuration and VP bowstringing in cadaver fingers in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> and to determine cut points for A 3 pulley rupture. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MRI in the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> was performed in 21 cadaver fingers with artificially created flexor tendon pulley tears (fingers with A 3 pulley rupture n[*]=[*] 16, fingers without A 3 pulley rupture n[*]=[*] 5). The distances of the translation of the VP relative to the middle phalanx base, the distances between the flexor tendons and the VP body, and the distances between the flexor tendon and bone (TB) were measured. RESULTS: Statistical analysis showed significantly lower VP translation distances and significantly higher VP tendon distances if the A 3 pulley was ruptured. A 2 TB and A 4 TB distances did not differ significantly in specimens with and without A 3 pulley rupture. The optimal cut points for A 3 pulley rupture were a VP translation distance 1. 4  mm. CONCLUSION: Reduction of the VP translation distance and augmentation of the VP tendon distance are suitable indirect signs of A 3 pulley rupture...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Disruption of {{the finger}} flexor tendon pulleys {{are the most}} often {{occurring}} injury in rock climbers due to bowstringing of tendons during crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position.</b> The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify friction between the flexor tendons and pulleys and the influence of high load and speed of movement as a potential factor of pulley disruption. METHODS: Friction between the flexor tendons and pulleys of eight human cadaver fingers was indirectly determined using an isokinetic movement device. During flexion and extension movement with rotational speed from 30 to 210 deg/s in the proximal interphalangeal joint and with load from 20 to 100 N to the flexor tendons the flexion force at the tip of the finger was measured. FINDINGS: With 40 N loaded flexor tendons the force at the fingertip was 14. 5 N (SD 1. 5) during extension and 12. 6 N (SD 1. 3) during flexion movement. Corresponding force difference of 12. 9 % and 3. 77 N (SD 0. 6) force of friction can be calculated. Friction peaked at 85. 8 degrees (SD 2. 05) of flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint. Different speed of motion and load to the flexor tendons did not influence force difference other than linear. INTERPRETATION: Considerable friction between flexor tendons and pulleys is apparent and therefore may have an influence on pulley injuries. Particularly during the crimp <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> where the proximal interphalangeal joint is flexed about 90 degrees shows the greatest amount of friction. However there was no change of friction during high speed motion and no other than linear increase during high load...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Handcycling is a {{relatively}} new wheelchair sport that has gained increased popularity for people with lower limb disabilities. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the effect of three different grip positions on physical parameters during handcycling in a laboratory setting. Methods: Twenty one able-bodied participants performed three maximum incremental handcycling tests until exhaustion, each with a different grip angle. The angle between the grip and the crank was randomly set at 90 ° (horizontal), 0 ° (vertical) or 10 ° (diagonal). The initial load was 20 W and increased by 20 W each five minutes. In addition, participants performed a 20 s maximum effort. Results: The relative peak functional performance (W/kg), peak heart rate (bpm), associated lactate concentrations (mmol/l) and peak oxygen uptake per kilogram body weight (ml. min- 1. kg- 1) for the different grip positions during the stage test were: (a) Horizontal: 1. 43 ± 0. 21 W/kg, 170. 14 ± 12. 81 bpm, 9. 54 ± 1. 93 mmol/l, 30. 86 ± 4. 57 ml/kg; (b) Vertical: 1. 38 ± 0. 20 W/kg, 171. 81 ± 13. 87 bpm, 9. 91 ± 2. 29 mmol/l, 29. 75 ± 5. 13 ml/kg; (c) Diagonal: 1. 40 ± 0. 22 W/kg, 169. 19 ± 13. 31 bpm, 9. 34 ± 2. 36 mmol/l, 29. 39 ± 4. 70 ml/kg. Statistically significant (p < 0. 05) differences could only be found for lactate concentration between the vertical <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> and the other grips during submaximal handcycling. Conclusion: The orientation of three different grip angles made no difference to the peak load achieved during an incremental handcycling test and a 20 second maximum effort. At submaximal load, higher lactate concentrations were found when the vertical <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> was used, suggesting that this position may be less efficient than the alternative diagonal or horizontal grip positions...|$|E
40|$|Imitation is an {{important}} form of social behavior, and research has aimed to discover and explain the neural and kinematic aspects of imitation. However, much of this research has featured single participants imitating in response to pre-recorded video stimuli. This is in spite of findings that show reduced neural activation to video versus real life movement stimuli, particularly in the motor cortex. We investigated {{the degree to which}} video stimuli may affect the imitation process using a novel motion tracking paradigm with high spatial and temporal resolution. We recorded 14 positions on the hands, arms, and heads of two individuals in an imitation experiment. One individual freely moved within given parameters (moving balls across a series of pegs) and a second participant imitated. This task was performed with either simple (one ball) or complex (three balls) movement difficulty, and either face-to-face or via a live video projection. After an exploratory analysis, three dependent variables were chosen for examination: 3 D <b>grip</b> <b>position,</b> joint angles in the arm, and grip aperture. A cross-correlation and multivariate analysis revealed that object-directed imitation task accuracy (as represented by <b>grip</b> <b>position)</b> was reduced in video compared to face-to-face feedback, and in complex compared to simple difficulty. This was most prevalent in the left-right and forward-back motions, relevant to the imitator sitting face-to-face with the actor or with a live projected video of the same actor. The results suggest that for tasks which require object-directed imitation, video stimuli may not be an ecologically valid way to present task materials. However, no similar effects were found in the joint angle and grip aperture variables, suggesting that there are limits to the influence of video stimuli on imitation. The implications of these results are discussed with regards to previous findings, and with suggestions for future experimentation...|$|E

In this paper, the EMG signal {{and its role in}} effective communication between a DC motor with a voltage trigger and neurofeedback are initially explained. Moreover, by introducing a filtration method, EMG pulses are obtained as stepping pulses with a signal-specific height of a voltage between 0 and 6  V, according to EMG domain voltage, with a time interval adapted from the EMG stimulus pulses. Two data points from each channel of EMG were extracted. The domain of the voltage of the EMG signal is impacted on the output of the fuzzy logic unit, and also the time amount between each stimulus of the EMG signal is the input of the PD controller.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has identified that prehension {{is composed of}} a reach and a grasp component and that the position {{and size of the}} object can independently affect each. However, no effects on prior to contact prehension kinematics have been reported for manipulations in object mass. We felt that this 'lack of a finding' was surprising, as a more accurate <b>grip</b> <b>position</b> on heavier objects would prevent slippage and rotation when lifting the object. Therefore, we hypothesized that increased object mass would effect the grasp component movement kinematics prior to contact in preparation for a stable final grip placement on the object. We report two experiments in which participants reached, grasped and lifted objects of various size and mass, and their movement kinematics were recorded using a motion tracking system. The results showed that the mass of the object significantly influenced prior-to-contact grasp kinematics. Both studies showed that the heavy compared to light objects caused increased peak grasp aperture, a final finger and thumb placement on the object that more closely passed through the object centre of mass, increased lift delay and reduced peak lift velocity.

5000|$|After the United States' {{entry into}} World War II, {{complaints}} arose from Army soldiers and Marines issued World War I-era bronze or alloy-handled trench knives {{such as the}} U.S. Mark I trench knife for use in hand-to-hand fighting. The Mark I was relatively expensive and time-consuming to manufacture, and reports from the field indicated that the knife's large 'brass-knuckle' fingerguard handle {{made it difficult to}} secure in conventional scabbards while limiting the range of useful fighting <b>grip</b> <b>positions.</b> [...] Another criticism was that the Mark I's relatively thin blade was prone to breakage when used for common utility tasks such as cutting wire or opening ammunition crates and ration cans. [...] A final impetus came from the War Department, which had determined the need for a new multipurpose knife capable of fulfilling the roles of both a fighting and a utility knife, {{while at the same time}} conserving strategic metal resources.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike Poma's grips, Doppelmayr <b>grips</b> are double <b>position</b> <b>grips.</b> When {{the chair}} enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed {{down by a}} metal strip, which opens a grip jaw. The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the terminal. Grip {{clamping}} force is measured {{just prior to the}} double <b>position</b> <b>grips</b> reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma's grips, in which grip force can be measured as the grip travels through the contour. Insufficient grip force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a grip force-alarmed grip and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal.|$|R
