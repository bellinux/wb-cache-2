40|$|Diagnostic PD {{testing of}} medium voltage cables can be {{performed}} at very low frequencies (VLF, 0. 1 Hz), to reduce capacitive currents. At 0. 1 Hz the field distribution in the field grading materials is likely {{different from the one}} at power frequency, possibly leading to wrong conclusions from the tests. The frequency dependency of such materials, can be investigated using previously tested PD sources, where different PD parameters have been characterised as function of frequency. In this work, it was tested if hollow glass microspheres were suited as such a PD source. The spheres were molded into a silicone cup and tested under a uniform field. Before each test, the test object was electrical conditioned for 16. 5 hours either at 6 kV at 50 Hz or at ground potential to have equal initial conditions. The PD inception and <b>extinction</b> <b>voltage</b> were tested as indicators of the field strength {{at the site of the}} spheres. These parameters were, among others, found for selected frequencies in the range from 0. 1 to 50 Hz. The data was recorded during the tests and later analysed with PRPD-, Weibull- and pulse sequence analysis. A finite element simulation was performed to find the relation between the applied voltage and the field strength inside the glass sphere. The tests showed a great dependency on the initial condition, with a higher PD inception voltage after a period of grounding. This showed the importance of an equal initial condition and a standardized conditioning period before each test. The inception voltage varied a bit, but the <b>extinction</b> <b>voltage</b> was more consistent and found to be a good parameter for determining the field strength inside the spheres. The cavity discharges gave characteristic and easily recognizable patterns in the PRPD-analysis, the shape parameters in the Weibull distributions were consistent with the literature and the pulse sequence analysis confirmed the earlier findings and could also reveal periods without discharges. The start electron availability decreased during a long period of many test series, causing the discharge characteristics to change, but still being consistent with cavity discharges. A relation between the applied voltage and the field strength inside the spheres was found through the FEM simulations and the decrease in the repetition rate with decreasing voltage. Based on these findings, the spheres can be suited for testing, if the start electron availability reaches a steady state.

40|$|The present {{demand for}} higher {{efficiency}} and {{flexibility in the}} energy sector {{has led to an}} increased use of power electronic generated waveforms as these allow energy conversion between different frequencies including DC. The generated waveforms are usually synthesized by so called Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) techniques, where the desired waveform is approximated by a number of square shaped pulses with a short rise time. Applications such as variable speed drives and reactive power compensation are saving vast amount of energy. This makes it important to understand how rapidly rising voltages affect insulation systems. In particular this applies to partial discharges (PDs), which are considered as affecting the life time of insulation considerably. This thesis presents an investigation regarding the behavior of PDs for different voltage waveforms characterized by steep rise times. The analysis method is based on moderately sharp frequency filters in the PD decoupler, high-resolution digitizers and time-domain stochastic filtering. Although entirely passive, the PD decoupler filter suppression can be made to change two orders of magnitude in half a decade of frequency enabling studies down to nanoseconds in the PD rise time. Voltages of different rise times are employed, which resulted in significant differences in the PD behavior. Applying square-like voltages to cavities with dielectrically insulated electrodes significantly affects the discharge amplitude, its rise time, the <b>extinction</b> <b>voltage</b> and the distribution shape. The investigation shows that the amplitude of the PDs increases considerably while the rise time of the PD signal decreases for shorter voltage rise times. Thus continued investigations applying PWM waveform of different level of filtering (smoothness) is important. An approach is presented which accepts both timing jitter and a non-integer relation between carrier and modulating frequency. The modified method is first used on the cavity test object and the observations found for semi-square wave forms were confirmed also on other insulation system such as a motor stator and a twisted pair test object. For the phase resolved PD (PRPD) pattern to become similar to the normal AC pattern, it is required that the remains from PWM steps are lower than the <b>extinction</b> <b>voltage.</b> Thus limits for a sufficient smoothing level are found, which is of importance when designing insulation systems exposed to fast transients. To illustrate the degradation process, microscopic images show how the rise times affect the cavity surface deterioration, observations that are consistent with the electrical measurements. The same observations were found valid on motor insulation. Finally a simulation model was introduced with sufficient detail to reproduce the observations. A relation between over voltage level and PD quench voltage was found necessary to enable the reproduction of the measured results [...] This also results in a lower <b>extinction</b> <b>voltage</b> for short rise times...|$|E

The influence of industrial treatment (polishing, mechanical shocks, and electrical arcs in air) of pure metals and silver-metal alloys on their EWF is experimentally investigated. To study the effects of arcing on the EWF, the metallic samples were subjected to electrical arcs in air, at atmospheric pressure, and room temperature, after that, they have been introduced into the vacuum chamber of an experimental ultrahigh vacuum setup for EWF measurements. Fowler's method of isothermal curves was used for the measurement of the EWF by the photoelectric effect. Contacts were mounted in a contactor working repetitively in air (laboratory atmosphere).

Therefore, intensive and abundant short-line fault tests (L 90) of a 245 kV SF 6 circuit breaker were performed at the KEMA High Power Laboratory. For the purpose of a comparative analysis three different sets of data were obtained during the tests: 1) High-resolution measurements of near current-zero arc current and voltage were carried out. The current zero measurement system (CZM) works as a standalone system in addition to the standard laboratory data acquisition system. The arc conductance shortly before current zero and the arc <b>voltage</b> <b>extinction</b> peak give a clear indication of the interrupting capability of the breaker under test. 2) From the measured traces of every individual test, arc parameters (3 time constants and 3 cooling-power constants) were extracted for the composite black box arc model, which has been developed by KEMA High Power Laboratory and is based on more than 1000 high-resolution measurements during tests of commercial high-voltage circuit breakers. Its aim is to simulate interruption phenomenon in SF 6 gas, evaluate performance of HV SF 6 circuit breakers in testing and enable the prediction of the performance under conditions other than those tested. 3) After each test, using specially developed computer software, based on a simplified physical enthalpy flow arc model, the values of the arcing contact distance, gas mass flow through the nozzle throat and pressure inside the compression cylinder were calculated.

40|$|To {{enable the}} next {{generation}} subsea boosting and processing facilities, high power electrical connectors are strongly needed and {{considered one of the}} most critical components of the system. Electrical tree growth is a precursor to electrical breakdown in high voltage insulation materials. Therefore, the study of the tree growth dependency with hydrostatic pressure is needed to understand the behaviour of the insulation material used in subsea connectors. Silicone rubber (SiR) is used as an insulation material for these applications thanks to its higher viscosity characteristic in comparison with other solid insulation materials used in subsea cables. This property is the main factor that allows the water to be swiped off the connector when a receptacle is mated into the plug of a subsea connector. In addition, the silicone rubber must provide similar electric field control as other insulation materials used in cable terminations and connectors. The characteristics of partial discharges generated during the electrical tree growth and the light emission from the partial discharge pulses, have been studied under different pressure conditions. SiR samples, with a needle to plate electrode configuration, have been put into a pressure vessel to grow the electrical tree in the material under high hydrostatic pressure conditions. The electrical tree growth has been divided in three stages (initiation, intermediate and final or pre-breakdown stage) and tests have been performed at 1, 20 and 60 bar. A digital NIKON camera and a CCD camera have been used, both attached to a long-distance microscope, to observe in real time the tree growth and light emission, respectively. Pictures showed a higher growth speed for the electric tree as voltage and pressure were increased. The length of electrical trees pre-grown at lower pressures collapsed faster as the pressure increased, than those pre-grown at higher pressures under the same pressure increasing conditions. As the pressure increased, Pulse Sequence Analysis performed to the partial discharges measured confirmed the partial discharge inception and <b>extinction</b> <b>voltage</b> increase and showed a polarity dependency to space charge generation in addition to other patterns regarding the charge magnitude and phase of occurrence characteristics. Pressure vessel internal reflections have suggested changes to be done in future studies for the light emission measurement. Finally, partial discharge patterns from the electrical tree growth process have been identified to be characteristics from void faults in the dielectric with a spherical void shape.

40|$|Electrical {{insulation}} can today {{be exposed}} to voltages having considerably higher frequency components than the conventional power frequency AC 50 Hz or 60 Hz, for example due to {{the increased use of}} power electronics in power systems. This has in a number of cases caused unexpected behaviour, including failures. One factor influencing the insulation is partial discharges (PDs), and the occurrence of these can also be an indicator of the condition of the insulation. There are therefore several reasons why PD measurements at these kinds of voltages are desirable. Measuring PDs at voltages with short rise times is however difficult as {{there is no longer a}} large difference in frequency contents between the PDs and the applied voltage waveform. This thesis reports on the development of a PD measuring system intended for use at repetitive, rapidly changing voltages, i. e. square-like voltages, also during the voltage flanks. Numerous experiments as well as theoretical derivations performed showed that the PDs are measurable, using a coupling capacitor and a coupling device, without necessarily requiring high order filters. The measuring system proposed still relies on the difference in frequency contents between the PDs and the applied voltage to certain extent, but also utilizes the stochastic properties of the PDs. Measurements at voltage levels up to 18 kV peak-to-peak with rise times down to 2 μs are reported. Studies on a number of vastly different kinds of test objects are reported, with the purposes of both ensuring a general applicability of the measuring system and increasing the knowledge on PD behaviour. For example, the appearance of corona is studied through analysis of statistical distributions, as function of steepness of the applied voltage. When analysing numerous periods of the applied voltage, it is found that the first PD after the switching event appears with some variation in time. This is an important observation since it implies that if a blind region is present during the flanks, some PDs will still be detected, as long as the blind region is shorter than the time interval where PDs are distributed. However, PDs are found to appear during the voltage flanks in many cases, why it is emphasized that measurements in these critical regions are crucial in order to get the full picture of the PD behaviour. Further, investigations of the PD <b>extinction</b> <b>voltage</b> in different types of test objects reveal that this parameter may be influenced by the rise time of the square-like voltage in some insulation systems whereas not in others. This observation implies that it is important to test insulation for the specific stresses it will {{be exposed to}} and such knowledge could ultimately be utilized when designing appropriate insulation systems for specific applications...|$|E
40|$|Investigation {{into the}} dynamic {{characteristics}} and decaying behaviour of SF 6 arcs during the current-zero period {{is of great}} significance to improving the interruption performance of high voltage circuit breakers and ensuring their reliable operation. The present research was conducted by means of modeling and experiment to provide a better knowledge of the switching process to help the design and optimization of high voltage SF 6 circuit breakers. The {{first part of the}} work concerns the determination of thermophysical properties of SF 6 plasmas under local thermodynamic equilibrium state (LTE). A systematic comparison with transport coefficients obtained using an old data set and experimental test has been performed to check the reliability of the proposed phenomenological approach in evaluating transport cross sections. Properties especially transport coefficients become sensitive to the choice of Debye length definition predominantly due to the different collision integrals affected by the different screening distance. Pressures increase can also influence thermophysical properties due to the inhibited chemical reactions. Moreover, the thermophysical properties under non-equilibrium conditions have been investigated using a two-temperature model. It was noted that the special case with equal electrons and heavy species temperatures produces results agreeing excellently with those obtained by the LTE model. The forms of mass action laws as well as the choice of reaction excitation temperature for molecular ionization used in the calculation can significantly modify the species composition and plasma properties. This model lays the micro-theoretical foundation for a deeper understanding of SF 6 plasma formation and evolution mechanism and provides a reliable properties input for non-equilibrium arc behaviour simulation. Following a traditional approach of arc modelling assuming LTE, considerable effort has been devoted to study the arc-shock interaction and its influence on the dynamic characteristics and current zero behaviour of SF 6 arcs in a supersonic nozzle with a hollow contact. It was found that the close coupling between the shock region and its surrounding gas flow greatly influences the aerodynamic and electrical behaviour of a nozzle arc and hence the thermal recovery process. In addition, deceleration of gas flow caused by the shocks and enhanced turbulent cooling brought by the sucked gas interacting with the arc both {{play a significant role in}} the determination of the thermal interruption capability. Possible departure from LTE in a decaying SF 6 arc was studied using a two-temperature hydrodynamic model in a supersonic nozzle under well-controlled conditions. The predicted radial temperature variation presents quite good agreement with test result using emission spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that the electron and heavy-particle temperature diverge in cases where the collision energy exchange is ineffective. For the arc decay phase, the two-temperature model gives a lower cooling rate than the LTE model, and hence a higher conductance of the discharge passage at current zero showing the necessity of using a two-temperature model to accurately predict the current interruption capability of SF 6 gas-blast circuit breakers. For thermal recovery phase, considering the chemically non-equilibrium effect, a global kinetic model of decaying SF 6 arcs was established to study the electrons elimination mechanisms around current zero. For dielectric recovery phase, the critical dielectric strength of hot SF 6 are investigated based on a two-term Boltzmann equation solution of electrons energy distribution function. It is noted that the main mechanisms of electrons elimination are the dissociative attachment from 3500 K to 7500 K, electron-molecular ion recombination in the temperature lower than 3500 K. The temperature increase, pressure decrease and departure from chemically non-equilibrium can all contribute to the dielectric strength reduction. The entrainment of PTFE ablation vapour can enhance the dielectric strengh of SF 6 above 2500 K. Finally, this research manufactures a model SF 6 gas blast interrupter and investigates the dynamic characteristics of electrical, light radiation, pressure along together with electrode movement. Arc dynamic characteristics and decaying behaviour of CO 2 and N 2 is compared with that of SF 6 arcs in order to obtain the dominant properties influencing arc quenching. It is noted that the <b>extinction</b> <b>voltage,</b> which decreases with increase in the interrupting current, is related to the conductance decay during current zero period and can be considered as an evaluation of interruption capability. Gas blast can bring a much more rapid variation of arc resistance and a much higher cut-off current before its extinction. SF 6 has a superior interruption capability possibly due to its high thermal conductivity and specific heat...|$|E
