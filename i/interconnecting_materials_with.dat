Solder is a traditional <b>interconnect</b> <b>material</b> widely used in electronic packaging industry, but now more attention is being paid to isotropic conductive adhesive (ICA) as an environmentally friendly <b>interconnect</b> <b>material</b> <b>with</b> advantages of low processing temperature, simple processing conditions and good manufacturability.

This paper aims to enrich the reliability study of ICA, by studying the reliability of a novel fast curing ICA which has a curing degree of 97. 8 % with 3 min of curing time at 150 ć.

Finite element (FE) analyses were conducted on assemblies with AuSn interconnects. Stress analyses require data on the materials stress-strain behavior, however, in case of AuSn solder joints material characteristics are not easily available. In the paper investigations on material characterization concerning the elastic and plastic behaviour as well as the fatigue properties of electroplated Au and AuSn are reported. It is shown that properties of these materials depend strongly on their composition and their microstructure, the latter being fundamentally affected by processing. By application of thermal lap shear tests the low cycle fatigue behavior of AuSn joints is studied. The results show that inter-phase cracking is the dominant fatigue failure mechanism, which is only indirectly linked to plastic straining calculated under homogeneity assumption. Computational analyses concerning the reliability of AuSn flip chip joints for GaAs pixel detectors are finally reported in the paper...|$|R

40|$|Two {{important}} degradation {{mechanisms in}} Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFC) {{are directly related}} to the metallic interconnects. The formation of volatile chromium oxides from metallic interconnects commonly causes fast degradation in cell performance due to poisoning the cathode. Secondly is the ability of the metallic interconnect to form a thin protective oxide {{one of the most important}} lifetime limiting factors for SOFC. Chromium volatilization of various uncoated steels is studied as a function of temperature by a recently developed denuder technique which allows time resolved quantification of volatile chromium species. The inhibition of Cr evaporation by Co thin film coatings (800 nm) is investigated; it will be shown that these coatings are more effective than much thicker ceramic coatings that are commonly used for this purpose. In order to increase the lifetime of the metallic components in SOFC nano-coatings of reactive elements (RE) have been investigated as well. The application of such coatings can reduce the corrosion rates substantially and thus increase the lifetime of the fuel cell stack. It will be shown that it is possible to combine the positive effects of RE with the beneficial effects of a Co coating and thus to obtain an <b>interconnect</b> <b>material</b> <b>with</b> low Cr evaporation and increased oxidation resistance...|$|R

However, some challenging issues still exist for the currently available ECAs, including lower electrical conductivity, conductivity fatigue in reliability tests, limited current-carrying capability, poor impact strength, etc. The interfacial properties {{is one of the major}} considerations when resolving these challenges and developing high performance conductive adhesives. Surface functionalization and interface modification are the major approaches used in this thesis. Fundamental understanding and analysis of the interaction between various types of interface modifiers and ECA materials and substrates are the key for the development of high performance ECA for lead-free interconnects. The results of this thesis provide the guideline for the enhancement of interfacial properties of metal-metal and metal-polymer interactions. Systematic investigation of various types of ECAs contributes to a better understanding of materials requirements for different applications, such as surface mount technology (SMT), flip chip applications, flat panel display modules with high resolution, etc. Improvement of the electrical, thermal and reliability of different ECAs make them a potentially ideal candidate for high power and fine pitch microelectronics packaging option.

40|$|As {{there is}} a need to {{increase}} the number of transistors while lowering chip dimensions and reducing power consumption, there have been sudden changes in the materials used in modern microelectronics applications. Aluminum interconnects in the microelectronic devices have been pushed to their dimensional limits due to reliability problems. Copper, having a higher conductivity and better electromigration properties is replacing aluminum in integrated circuits. It is also beneficial to use a <b>material</b> <b>with</b> the low dielectric constant (K) to fill the space between Cu interconnect lines in order to reduce the amount of cross talk between interconnects and place them closer to each other.

40|$|Interconnects are a {{critical}} element of an SOFC assembly and although much work {{has focused on}} chromium and chromium-iron alloys containing an oxide that is both oxidation resistant and electrically conductive, the thermal instability of typical native metal oxides allow interdiffusion of cations across the interconnect-electrode boundary that ultimately leads to degradation of SOFC performance. Phase I of the SECA Core Technology Program has been a one-year effort to investigate and evaluate the feasibility of: (1) Ion implanting an alumina-scale forming ferritic steel, such as FeCrAlY, to form an <b>interconnect</b> <b>material</b> <b>with</b> low resistance ( 1000 hours at 800 C) in contact with an LSF cathode material. We confirmed, {{as part of our}} oxidation kinetics evaluation of FeCrAlY and 430 ferritic steel, the parabolic growth of a mixed chromia/alumina scale on FeCrAlY and a single chromia layer {{in the case of the}} 430 stainless steel; the outer contiguous layer of Al{sub 2 }O{sub 3 }, in the case of FeCrAlY, forming a stable, self-limiting, protective scale with no detectable cation interdiffusion between FeCrAlY and an LSF electrode even after 1000 hours at 800 C in air. To render the alumina scale conductive, we implanted either titanium or niobium ions into FeCrAlY scales to a fixed depth (0. 12 {micro}m), varying only the thickness of the oxide. ASR for an un-doped FeCrAlY oxide scale (i. e., alumina) was more than an order of magnitude greater than the 430 control sample whereas, the ASR for the doped FeCrAlY oxide scale sample was comparable to the 430 control sample; hence, the resistance of a doped alumina scale on FeCrAlY was equal to the resistance of a chromia-scale forming alloy, such as 430 (chromia scales of which are typically < 0. 1 {Omega}-cm). Along with the ASR measurements, AC impedance measurements were conducted to evaluate conduction mechanisms. From the AC impedance measurements, we observed that the addition of niobium resulted in at least a two order of magnitude reduction in resistance over the un-doped specimen and that the conduction in the doped alumina scale was pure electronic conduction, as opposed to mixed ionic-electronic conduction (dominated by intrinsic (ionic) defects) for the un-doped alumina scales. The DC resistance component was {approx} 4 {Omega} although when this value is adjusted to account for the system resistance (i. e., leads, junctions, etc.), the ASR was determined to be < 0. 1 {Omega}-cm; even after 1000 hours at 800 C in air. Our results have clearly shown that dopant additions increase the electronic conductivity of alumina forming scale alloys, such as FeCrAlY, transforming from a mixed ionic/electronic conduction mechanism. Just as importantly, the demonstrated stable formation of an alumina scale was shown to be an advantage over conventional pure chromia forming alloys as <b>interconnect</b> <b>materials...</b>|$|R

40|$|In the {{electronics}} industry, packaging {{is responsible to}} protect chip from atmosphere and provide the path for signal communication as well as thermal dissipation. The realization of these functions in a packaging system depends {{on the performance of}} <b>interconnect</b> <b>materials.</b> Any failure on the <b>interconnect</b> <b>materials</b> could make entire system down. Currently, {{one of the most popular}} <b>interconnect</b> <b>materials</b> is lead-free solder, which has been used for two decades instead of toxic Sn-Pb solder. The updates on processes, equipments and standards for lead-free solder have been completed. However, as continuous increase on the chip power and the miniaturization of consumer electronics, lead-free solder is facing big challenges. The disadvantages of traditional lead-free solder, such as high process temperature, grain coarsening and thermal fatigue failure, are gradually exposed. Therefore, one of the urgent needs for packaging is to develop new <b>interconnect</b> <b>materials.</b> In recent years, as the development of nanotechnology, nanostructured materials are gradually applied on the packaging. Following this tendency, two promising nanostructured <b>interconnect</b> <b>materials</b> are presented in this thesis. The first part of this thesis shows a nanocomposite material. It consists of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles and Sn- 58 Bi solder matrix. Sn- 58 Bi solder has the advantage on low process temperature. However the inherent brittleness of Sn- 58 Bi limits its application. For this reason, the Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles are added into the Sn- 58 Bi in order to improve the mechanical properties. The result of shear test shows that the shear strength of Sn- 58 Bi increases by two times by the addition of Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu nanoparticles. The result also indicates that the nanocomposite solder has excellent thermal fatigue resistance. The demonstrated properties make nanocomposite solder can be a potential candidate for replacing Sn-Ag-Cu in future. In this thesis, we also present another kind of <b>interconnect</b> <b>material</b> based on vertically aligned carbon nanofibers. High stability and compatibility of carbon nanofibers are always attractive to the packaging industry. By using a series of processes, such as plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition, sputtering, transfer and bonding, the vertically aligned carbon nanofibers are successfully assembled in the packaging system. As <b>interconnect</b> <b>material,</b> vertically aligned carbon nanofibers exhibit acceptable electrical resistance and shear strength.

For comparison, both patterned and uniform ITO films ITO films on Si 3 N 4 /PEN were fabricated. The results of the in-depth characterization of Graphene are reported and based on Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Raman Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are reported. The fatigue characteristics of ITO were determined at stress amplitudes ranging from 2000 MPa to 400 MPa up to 5000 cycles.

Different analytical models of single- (SWCNT), double- (DWCNT), and multiwalled CNTs (MWCNT) are studied to analyze the crosstalk delay at global interconnect lengths. A capacitively coupled three-line bus architecture employing CMOS driver is used for accurate estimation of crosstalk delay. Each line in bus architecture is represented with the equivalent RLC models of single and bundled SWCNT, DWCNT, and MWCNT interconnects. Crosstalk delay is observed at middle line (victim) when it switches in opposite direction with respect to the other two lines (aggressors).
