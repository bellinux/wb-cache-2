50|$|In {{the fields}} villagers <b>harvest</b> <b>and</b> <b>thresh</b> traditionally, no <b>machinery</b> is used. As the sun rises, they reap the mature rice plants and replant new ones in their place. Harvested rice plants are cleaned, sprayed, and bundled. Women stoop for hours, {{their feet in}} the mud, to replant each rice root, and as the water recedes, a field of green is once again visible. Part of the rice harvest is grilled, ground, and winnowed, a ritual {{preparation}} for the upcoming celebration. Rice {{is also used to}} prepare lunch. One meal reflective of both the fishing and rice industry is Tonlé sap chicken. The rice and chicken is cooked in the river’s water, and prahok paste made from fish, is then mixed in to add flavor.|$|R

40|$|Farming {{practice}} in a floodplain environment holds great ecological, economic and social significance. In many cases, agriculture is modernized without caring much for the local environmental conditions. The traditional farming practices, although relatively less productive, are {{more often than not}} ecofriendly and sustainable. This paper attempts to study the farming practices followed in a floodplain village of the Brahmaputra valley, Assam, India in terms of cropping practice, inputs and crop protection measures, methods of <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> <b>threshing</b> <b>and</b> changes in cropping technology. The study is based on (i) primary data collected from all the 408 households of the village through a purposively designed survey schedule, (ii) interviews with selected farmers and other local knowledgeable persons, and (iii) field observation made by the authors. The data and information thus generated have been summarized using simple statistical and cartographic tools. The study reveals that the farming {{practice in}} the village is still traditional in nature with little application of modern inputs and implements. The small size of landholding and scattering of plots and very limited diversification of the rural economy hinder the process of modernization of the farming practice...|$|R

Labor exchange occurs for almost every task associated with rice farming, {{although it is}} most common for transplanting, <b>harvesting,</b> <b>and</b> <b>threshing.</b> There are two different patterns of farm exchange. In central and southern Laos, villagers call on many other households, sometimes the entire village, for one day's help to complete a specific task such as transplanting. No specific repayment is required, but the family is obligated to help others in the village if {{they are unable to}} finish work in time. In northern villages, mutual assistance is organized on the basis of exchanges between families that should even out over the year; a day's work transplanting may be repaid by a day's work threshing. The contributions of men, women, and children over sixteen are considered equal, regardless of the task.|$|R

30|$|The word *vari-(n)ci (with {{variants}} *vari, *varici, *varinci) “rice, paddy” DEDR 5265 can be reconstructed for Proto-Peninsular Dravidian, as cognate {{forms are}} found in languages of all four subgroups; it is not reconstructible to North Dravidian. It {{is the source of}} the word for “paddy”—i.e., rice in the field or after <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> <b>threshing,</b> either husked or unhusked, but not yet cooked—in most of the modern Peninsular Dravidian languages.

It also has the meaning “seed”, as in Tamil ēlav-arici “cardamom seed”, Kannada ēl-akki.

40|$|Over {{the past}} half a century {{developing}} regions, {{with the exception of}} Sub-Saharan Africa, have seen labor-saving technologies adopted at unprecedented levels. Intensification of production systems created power bottlenecks around the land preparation, <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> <b>threshing</b> operations. Alleviating the power bottlenecks with the adoption of mechanical technologies helped enhance agricultural productivity and lowered the unit cost of crop production even in the densely populated countries of Asia. Economic growth and the commercialization of agricultural systems is leading to further mechanization of agricultural systems in Asia and Latin America. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to have very low levels of mechanization and available data indicate declining rather than increasing levels of adoption, even among the countries that were the early trendsetters, such as Kenya and Zimbabwe. This chapter documents the trends and sequential patterns in the adoption of mechanical technology, assesses the evidence on the productivity and equity impact of mechanization, and discusses the implication for mechanization policy.

40|$|The {{origins of}} {{agriculture}} involved pathways of domestication {{in which human}} behaviours and plant genetic adaptations were entangled. These changes resulted in consequences that were unintended {{at the start of}} the process. This paper highlights some of the key innovations in human behaviours, such as soil preparation, <b>harvesting</b> <b>and</b> <b>threshing,</b> <b>and</b> how these were coupled with genetic ‘innovations’ within plant populations. We identify a number of ‘traps’ for early cultivators, including the needs for extra labour expenditure on crop-processing and soil fertility maintenance, but also linked gains in terms of potential crop yields. Compilations of quantitative data across a few different crops for the traits of nonshattering and seed size are discussed in terms of the apparently slow process of domestication, and parallels and differences between different regional pathways are identified. We highlight the need to bridge the gap between a Neolithic archaeobotanical focus on domestication and a focus of later periods on crop-processing activities and labour organization. In addition, archaeobotanical data provide a basis for rethinking previous assumptions about how plant genetic data should be related to the origins of agriculture and we contrast two alternative hypotheses: gradual evolution with low selection pressure versus metastable equilibrium that prolonged the persistence of ‘semi-domesticated’ populations. Our revised understanding of the innovations involved in plant domestication highlight the need for new approaches to collecting, modelling and integrating genetic data and archaeobotanical evidence...|$|R

A long war, not with cranes, but with weeds, those Trojans who had sun and rain and dews on their side. Daily the beans saw me come to their rescue armed with a hoe, and thin the ranks of their enemies, filling up the trenches with weedy dead. Many a lusty crest--waving Hector, that towered a whole foot above his crowding comrades, fell before my weapon and rolled in the dust.|$|R
