5|$|Its hairless, splotchy gray or gray-brown skin {{falls in}} folds to the shoulder, back and rump. The skin has a natural mosaic pattern, which lends the rhino an armored appearance. The neck <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Javan {{rhinoceros}} {{are smaller than}} those of the Indian rhinoceros, but still form a saddle shape over the shoulder. Because of the risks of interfering with such an endangered species, however, the Javan rhinoceros is primarily studied through fecal sampling and camera traps. They are rarely encountered, observed or measured directly.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoral}} hood {{projects at}} the front of the labia commissure, where the edges of the labia majora (outer lips) meet at the base of the pubic mound; it forms as part of the external <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> labia minora (inner lips) and covers the glans and external shaft. There is considerable variation in how much of the glans protrudes from the hood and how much is covered by it, ranging from completely covered to fully exposed, and tissue of the labia minora also encircles the base of the glans.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{symptoms}} of atopic dermatitis vary from person to person, the most common symptoms are dry, itchy, red skin.

Most dry suits can be equalised against squeeze via a {{manually operated valve}} fed from a low pressure gas supply. Air must be manually injected during the descent to avoid squeeze and is manually or automatically vented on the ascent to maintain buoyancy control.|$|E

25|$|Bars are the inward <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall, {{originating}} from the heels at an abrupt angle. The strong structure built {{up by the}} extremity of the heel and of the bar is named the 'heel buttress'. The sole between the heel walls and the bars is named the 'seat of corn', {{and it is a}} very important landmark used by natural hoof trimmers to evaluate the correct heel height. The bars have a three-layer structure, just like the walls (see above). When overgrown, they bend outwards and cover the lower surface of the sole.|$|E
25|$|The {{human brain}} {{is not fully}} {{developed}} {{by the time a}} person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior (see Cognitive development below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age. Thus, the brain does not grow in size much during adolescence. However, the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes in the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.|$|E
25|$|The forelimbs {{are covered}} with large {{transverse}} scales. Both the forelimbs and the hind limbs are webbed, reflecting their largely aquatic habits. The necks of black marsh turtles are characteristically thick, forming a collar around the head when it is retracted into the shell. All of the limbs, the tail, and the neck are dark gray to black. The head is broad with a short upwardly pointed snout. It is mostly black on top with cream to yellow markings around the eyes and at the throat. It also has a pair of pale white to yellow spots just behind the tympanum, usually hidden behind the <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> neck. The powerful jaws are pale yellow to pale brown in color and curves upwards, earning it the charming name of 'smiling terrapin'.|$|E
40|$|AbstractHere, we {{show that}} during in vivo <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> precursor, <b>the</b> propeptide <b>of</b> {{subtilisin}} nattokinase functions as an intramolecular chaperone (IMC) that organises <b>the</b> in vivo <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subtilisin domain. Two residues belonging to β-strands formed by conserved regions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> IMC are crucial for <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> subtilisin domain through direct interactions. An identical protease can fold into different conformations in vivo due to <b>the</b> action <b>of</b> a mutated IMC, resulting in different kinetic parameters. Some interfacial changes involving conserved regions, even those induced by the subtilisin domain, blocked subtilisin folding and altered its conformation. Insight into {{the interaction between the}} subtilisin and IMC domains is provided by a three-dimensional structural model...|$|R

25|$|Her {{outer garment}} {{was a bright}} colored plaid worsted cloak {{reaching}} to within about six inches of the floor. Its size was most voluminous, but its fashion was extremely simple. It had a wide yoke across the shoulders, into which the broad plain breadths were gathered; and it was fastened at the throat by a huge ornamented brass hook and eye, from which hung a short chain of round twisted links. Her right arm protruded through a vertical slit {{at the side of}} the cloak and she held in her hand a sheet of paper covered with figures. The left arm on which she carried a large basket or bag — I couldn't tell which — was hidden by the ample <b>folds</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> garment. Her countenance was keen and nervous, but benignant.|$|E
