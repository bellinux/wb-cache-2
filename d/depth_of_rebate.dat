We use annual ENERGY STAR sales data for clothes washers, dishwashers, refrigerators and air conditioners from 2001 to 2006 and the variation in the coverage <b>of</b> <b>rebates</b> across US states and over time to identify the impact <b>of</b> <b>rebate</b> policies. We use, at first, a difference-in-differences approach to estimate this impact. Then, we {{take into account the}} possibility <b>of</b> <b>rebate</b> policies being endogenous and use instrumental variables approaches in fixed effects panel data regression models. Results suggest that rebate policies increase the sales share of ENERGY STAR household appliances by 3. 3 to 6. 6 percentage points, and this represents an impact of 9 to 18 % on the mean level of the sales share of ENERGY STAR household appliances in the US between 2001 and 2006. We conclude that rebates on ENERGY STAR appliances increase the uptake of energy-efficient appliances...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe thermal {{performance}} of window frames {{can easily be}} calculated using 2 D numerical simulations. Several commercial software packages are available, and international standards provide a clear methodology to calculate the thermal transmittance. However, even though these methods are well known in academia and the research community in general, thermal optimization has not reached its full potential in the building industry yet and there is considerable margin for improvement. Specifically for small and medium size enterprises {{there is a lack}} of guidelines that are both generic enough to guarantee a wide-spread use, as well as specific enough to allow an easy and straightforward interpretation and implementation. In this research project, generic window sections were developed for vinyl, aluminium and wooden frames in collaboration with the building industry. Based on a market survey, typical approaches for improving the {{thermal performance}} for each type of window frame have been identified and described. Subsequently, the impact of separate improvements, as well as combined effects have been studied using both standardized and advanced calculation methods. For this, the heat transfer phenomena and the way these are modelled according to standard calculation procedures are discussed. Next to that, a number of secondary effect originating from standards are discussed, e. g. the thickness of the IGU, the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the window <b>rebate,</b> equivalent thermal conductivities and the impact of reduced heat transfer coefficients...|$|R

50|$|Following {{the passage}} of the Elkins Act, real freight rates {{decreased}} only slightly. In 1905, leaders in the regulation movement testified before Congress to identify the reduction in prices that resulted from the Act. Yet, in the first months following {{the passage of}} the law, the most pronounced change in railroad pricing was the elimination <b>of</b> <b>rebates.</b> However, later analysis has found that decreases in carrier prices are better attributable to decreases in the costs of operation due to technology advances. The elimination <b>of</b> <b>rebates</b> led the railroads to seek other methods to compete for business, leading Governor Albert B. Cummins of Iowa to declare, in 1905, that the elimination <b>of</b> <b>rebates</b> simply forces railroads to seek alternative noncompetitive means to secure business. The Elkins Act, thus, was more effective in stabilizing prices and entrenching price collusion than demonstrably lowering prices.|$|R

The analysis provides information on customers' willingness to pay for energy savings, the importance <b>of</b> <b>rebates</b> in customers' decisions, and customers' response to DSM programs that offer loans for purchases of high-efficiency appliances. An estimated model is used to forecast the decisions of customers under: higher <b>rebates,</b> replacement <b>of</b> <b>rebates</b> with finance programs, offering <b>of</b> loans and <b>rebates</b> as alternative options for customers, {{and the elimination of}} DSM programs.

40|$|According to the {{conventional}} theory, rebates are but one of many ways to price discriminate among consumers. The firm sells at the shelf price to those {{willing to pay more}} for the product and at a lower, rebated price, to those willing to pay less, achieving the necessary separation by relying on the higher costs <b>of</b> redeeming <b>rebates</b> <b>of</b> high willingness-to-pay consumers. This theory, however, does not explain several phenomena associated with rebates. Many consumers respond to rebates at the time of purchase, but far fewer redeem them after purchase. Without resorting to irrationality {{on the part of some}} consumers, this redemption gap cannot be explained by price discrimination theory. We also see free-after-rebate deals. This practice is also puzzling from the perspective of price discrimination, because a firm will surely lose money from rebate users. Finally, the usage <b>of</b> <b>rebates</b> tends to vary across industries and product categories even when the same consumers participate in each of them. We propose a non-price-discrimination theory <b>of</b> <b>rebates</b> based on the idea of “utility arbitrage. ” Key to our theory is a distinctive property of rebates: unlike other promotio...|$|R
