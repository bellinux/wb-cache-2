40|$|Ontologies and terminologies {{are used}} for {{interoperability}} of knowledge and data in a standard manner among <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups.</b> Existing imaging ontologies capture general aspects of the imaging domain as a whole such as methodological concepts or calibrations of imaging instruments. However, none of the existing ontologies covers the diagnostic features measured by imaging technologies {{in the context of}} neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, the Neuro-Imaging Feature Terminology (NIFT) was developed to organize the knowledge domain of measured brain features in association with neurodegenerative diseases by imaging technologies. The purpose is to identify quantitative imaging biomarkers that can be extracted from multi-modal brain imaging data. This terminology attempts to cover measured features and parameters in brain scans relevant to disease progression. In this paper, we demonstrate the systematic retrieval of measured indices from literature and ho w the extracted knowledge can be further used for disease modeling that integrates neuroimaging features with molecular processes...|$|E
40|$|Advanced Computation From {{engineering}} {{gas turbine}} blade cooling methods for more efficient engines to determining the optimal location for oil wells in the Gulf of Mexico, advanced computational techniques {{are becoming increasingly}} important as we study and interpret the world. From predicting complex processes in nature such as hurricane-induced storm surges to the gravitational waves emitted by the collision of two black holes, solving these Grand Challenge problems cannot be effectively tackled by a single researcher, or even a single group. Today’s complex problems require that <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> combine their expertise in computer science, applied mathematics, engineering, science and the humanities.

40|$|Gratefully, {{the quality}} of life for billions of people will improve {{drastically}} during the coming decades. This implies that the production of virtually every commodity will have to increase dramatically. Agriculture-related activities ought to provide food, feed, and non-edible plant-based products. The availability of natural resources per person will, however, continue to decline. Resource degradation like erosion, soil fertility decline, and water pollution further constrain production increases. Hence, the use efficiency of natural resources will have to be boosted drastically, while variability should be curtailed through enhanced buffering capacity of the production base to prevent shock in food systems. These changes in agricultural strategies also call for <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> to seek for synergies between production factors. This paper provides an overview of the challenges to meet the above mentioned production conditions and stresses the need for agro-ecological intelligence in choosing agricultural development strategies and, therefore, in designing agro-ecosystems.

40|$|This article explores how {{leadership}} {{is done in}} a 'leaderless' team. Drawing on a corpus of more than 120 hours of audio-recorded meetings of different <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> and using a discourse analytic framework and tools, we examine how {{leadership is}} enacted in a team {{that does not have}} an assigned leader or chair. Our specific focus is the discursive processes through which team members conjointly solve disagreements and negotiate consensus – which are two activities associated with leadership. More specifically, we analyse how meaning is collaboratively constructed and how team members arrive at a solution in those instances where there is some kind of disagreement, or even conflict, among team members. This discourse analytic study thus contributes to leadership research in two ways: i) by exploring some of the discursive processes through which leadership is actually performed in a 'leaderless team'; and ii) by looking at a largely under-researched leadership constellation, namely distributed leadership. We thereby illustrate some of the benefits that discourse analytical approaches offer {{to an understanding of the}} specific processes that are involved in the complexities of leadership performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{publishing}} {{of research}} has implications {{for the evaluation of}} research careers, research departments and funding for research projects. Researchers' academic evaluation relies heavily on the status of the journal in which a researcher publishes. The inclusion of one's work in Science Citation Index (SCI) and Social Science Citation Index (SSCI) is often used as an indicator of academic quality. This is unfortunate for many environmental researchers, as their journals are not represented in the SCI and SSCI. Two investigations were carried out to determine the reasons for this. The first investigation identified 352 existing environmental academic journals, classified into 7 categories (and several subcategories). Of these, 2 categories were not represented in the SCI or SSCI: environmental systems analysis journals, and corporate environmental management journals. The second survey investigated the publishing patterns of <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> and the characteristics of their journals. In spite of acceptable citation levels, interdisciplinary environmental journals are excluded from the SCI and SSCI. A major reason seems to be that citations of their articles are uncounted by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), the organization producing the SCI and SSCI, because citations mostly take place in a group of journals completely unrepresented in ISI's database...|$|E
40|$|Intro: To {{a growing}} extent, legal {{scholars}} {{seem to be}} dissatisfied with established disciplinary boundaries and turn to other disciplines, such as sociology (Cotterrell 2006), psychology (Wagenaar, Van Koppen & Crombag 1993), philosophy (Alexy 2003), economics (Posner 2007) and even literature studies (White 1985), for inspiration. In law faculties {{all over the world}} multidisciplinary and <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> are operative, such as the Jurisprudence and Social Policy program at the University of California, Berkeley, or the Institute of Criminology at Cambridge University. In the hope of increasing their chances to acquire a grant, applicants nowadays try to cut a dash with promises of combining insights from many different sources (Vick 2004, 171). One may wonder who will undertake the important but time-consuming task of analysing and classifying the existing body of legal norms in the future, when legal scholars are getting more and more reluctant to do so. However exciting these new research directions may appear, a fundamental question which deserves more attention is: What are the limits and possibilities of interdisciplinary research into law? Can concepts and methods from one discipline directly be transplanted into another discipline? What is lost and what is gained when insights from different origins are combined? In this article, we want to explore what might make interdisciplinary research possible, on the one hand, and what makes it difficult or even impossible, on the other hand...|$|E

40|$|Nucleic acids are {{virtually}} omnipresent; they exist in every living being. These macromolecules constitute {{the most important}} genetic storage material: the genes. Genes are conserved throughout the evolution of all living beings; they are transmitted from the parents to their offspring. Many <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> are interested in modifying nucleic acids {{for use in a}} wider variety of applications. These modified oligonucleotides are used in many diverse fields, including diagnostics, detection, and therapeutics. In this account, we summarize our research efforts related to modified nucleic acid systems. First, we discuss our syntheses of modified oligonucleotides containing fluorescent tags for use as molecular probes (molecular beacons) to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisim (SNP) in nucleic acids and to distinguish between the B and Z forms of DNA. We also describe our research efforts into oligonucleotides functionalized with steroid derivatives to enhance their cell permeability, and the synthesis of several calix[4]arene-oligonucleotide conjugates possessing the ability to form defined triplexes. In addition, we have performed systematic studies to have an understanding about the functional groups necessary for a given nucleoside to behave as an organo or hydrogelator. The aggregation properties of a number of nucleoside-based phospholipids have been examined in different solvents; some of these derivatives are potential candidates for use as nucleoside-based liposomes. Finally, we also describe our research efforts toward the preparation of isoxazole- and isoxazoline-containing nucleoside derivatives and the determination of their antiviral activities...|$|E

The overall purpose of the PATRIMA project is to promote and fund research on various aspects of heritage presentation and preservation. Such research being <b>interdisciplinary,</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> in history, physics, chemistry, biology and computer science are involved in this project. The PATRIMA consortium involves research groups from universities and from the main museums or cultural heritage institutions in Paris and surroundings.

40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{published}} literature narrative about equine-assisted or equine-facilitated social work or therapy, a growing area of interventions. The {{purpose is to}} shed light on gaps and contradictory results in previous studies between 2000 - 2014. The goal is to assist practitioners and researchers, identifying and providing perspectives on complicated issues when results of interventions are pointing in different directions. In total, 55 published articles and 15 dissertations were analyzed thematically. Excluded are studies focused on therapeutic riding for the physically disabled or hippotherapy benefiting from equine movement, as well as studies focused on individuals’ riding goals or horsemanship skills. The implications for further research address gaps in the literature on the process in equine assisted or facilitated work. The process need to be described from professional affiliation, the purpose of the intervention, theoretical perspective, the intended role of the horse, ethical approach both concerning the client and the horse, plan to prevent risks as well as describe risks in relation to possible outcomes both for the client and the horse and finally a description about how the intervention are evaluated. Standardization of terminology and language used to communicate interventions, methods, and theories is recommended. The analysis suggests a need to use a variety of research methods in <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>research</b> <b>groups.</b> This allows different paradigms of participatory, as well as constructivism or post-positivism, to capture the complexity of social work or therapy facilitated or assisted by horses. This article does not critically review each specific investigation, but focuses on how the process has been presented in previous research...|$|E
40|$|Background Three subject librarians and a data librarian, {{representing}} three {{departments and}} two libraries at a university, were awarded an NLM Informationist Supplement {{to support an}} <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Group</b> with an NIH grant. The Informationist Team developed a model to utilize the skills of multiple librarians to support {{the increasing number of}} <b>interdisciplinary</b> and interprofessional <b>research</b> <b>groups</b> at the university. Librarians routinely attended lab meetings and shared notes with each other to monitor researcher needs. Methods The Informationist Team regularly provided support for literature searches, creating search alerts, bibliographic citation management and sharing, and data management to an <b>interdisciplinary</b> <b>Research</b> <b>Group</b> over a two year period. Two new library workshops were also developed after observing researcher needs. Surveys were administered to the <b>Research</b> <b>Group</b> prior to, during, and after a two-year period to assess the effectiveness of an Informationist Team model that employs the skills of multiple librarians. Results Surveys administered to the <b>Research</b> <b>Group</b> showed that the group increased their use of appropriate resources to find scientific and technical information over a two-year period. Additionally, by the final survey, all members of the <b>Research</b> <b>Group</b> had worked with a librarian and all felt it had saved them time. The data librarian also facilitated the creation of a form to collect data for a lab protocol that helped the group avoid significant errors. Conclusions The relationship between the multidisciplinary Informationist Team and the <b>Research</b> <b>Group</b> was mutually beneficial. The <b>Research</b> <b>Group</b> was able to improve its knowledge and efficiency with the Informationist Team’s assistance, and regular librarian attendance at lab meetings enabled librarians to enhance their understanding of basic science research.
