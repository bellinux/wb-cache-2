50|$|Nevertheless {{the company}} itself was {{incapable}} of progressing the construction, and by early 1878 the GWR had made traffic and working agreements with the company, and the GWR Act of 22 July 1878 enabled the GWR to subscribe a further £20,000 to the undertaking. Daniel Gooch of the GWR became the company chairman and board meetings were held at Paddington instead of at Newnham. Still the line lay moribund for some two years until the GWR took over completely. An Act of 6 August 1880 authorised the GWR to absorb the undertaking and to complete the line, which it did at a further cost of £21,626, making a total cost to the GWR of £60,626. Still with the line completed, the GWR {{made no attempt to}} open it to traffic: economic depression dominated the Forest economy; moreover the completion of the S&WR Lydbrook extension provided a much more <b>direct</b> <b>outlet</b> for traffic from {{the northern part of the}} Forest to South Wales.|$|E
5000|$|Before the 19th century, the San Diego Creek basin {{consisted}} of extensive grasslands and seasonal wetlands, which would flood {{during the winter}} and spring with storm runoff from the Santa Ana Mountains and San Joaquin Hills.

The Santa Ana River, the main waterway of Orange County, would sometimes flow into Newport Bay via what is now {{the lower part of the}} San Diego Creek channel. This was observed several times during the 1800s and geological evidence suggests this regularly occurred as early as the Pleistocene period.

The aim of researches presented in the article has been to evaluate possibility for recovering of energy from air shock absorber without deterioration of vibration damping level, which can be provided by hydraulic shock absorber. The scheme of proposed air shock absorber, its mathematical model, the results of calculation for pressure increasing in shock absorber during its piston motion, for different velocity of the piston have been shown in the article. The characteristics of hydraulic absorber and air one with energy recovering have been compared. The model of the wheel and the automobile mass connected with that wheel has been presented. Using such model the simulations of the wheel and of the automobile mass motion, for tasked velocity of automobile have been made. The model of road microprofile has been elaborated [...] Using the models the recovered energy in the 1 km road section has been calculated...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} the global economy, growing demand by producers, {{distributors}} and consumers, increasing competitive pressure in all market actors, which undoubtedly implies the need for implementing new strategies and {{a higher level of}} effective planning, coordination and cooperation between national economies and companies worldwide. In this regard, particular question is how to improve conditions in those economies that have no <b>direct</b> <b>outlet</b> to the sea, and thus lead to a situation of "geographical handicap" in terms of countries with direct access to the marine waterways. Despite the fact that all developing countries have some way to go to economic and social welfare, the landlocked states have done worse {{as a result of their}} distinctive geographic handicaps. Landlocked countries not only face the challenge of long distance and isolation, but also the challenges that result from a dependence on passage through a sovereign transit country, one through which trade from a landlocked country must pass in order to access international shipping markets. Most discussions suggest that there is a complex relationships between landlocked countries i. e. transport isolation from world markets and economic growth and logistics costs. High logistics costs often depend from one side the poor road infrastructure but other side from mostly low level of logistics management and predictability which itself stem mostly from rent-seeking and governance issues that increase uncertainty along logistics chains. ...|$|E
40|$|Seawater {{reverse osmosis}} {{desalination}} concentrate may have chronic and/or acute impacts on the marine ecosystems in the near-field area of the discharge. Environmental impact of the desalination plant discharge is supposedly site- and volumetric- specific, and also depends on the salinity tolerance of the organisms inhabiting the water column in and around a discharge environment. Scientific studies that aim to understand possible impacts of elevated salinity levels are important to assess detrimental effects to organisms, especially for species with no mechanism of osmoregulation, e. g., presumably corals. Previous studies on corals indicate sensitivity toward hypo- and hyper-saline environments with small changes in salinity already affecting coral physiology. In order to evaluate sensitivity of Red Sea corals to increased salinity levels, we conducted a long-term (29 days) in situ salinity tolerance transect study at an offshore seawater reverse osmosis (SWRO) discharge on the coral Fungia granulosa. While we measured a pronounced increase in salinity and temperature at the <b>direct</b> <b>outlet</b> of the discharge structure, effects were indistinguishable from the surrounding environment {{at a distance of}} 5 m. Interestingly, corals were not affected by varying salinity levels as indicated by measurements of the photosynthetic efficiency. Similarly, cultured coral symbionts of the genus Symbiodinium displayed remarkable tolerance levels in regard to hypo- and hypersaline treatments. Our data suggest that increased salinity and temperature levels from discharge outlets wear off quickly in the surrounding environment. Furthermore, F. granulosa seem to tolerate levels of salinity that are distinctively higher than reported for other corals previously. It remains to be determined whether Red Sea corals in general display increased salinity tolerance, and whether this is related to prevailing levels of high(er) salinity in the Red Sea in comparison to other oceans...|$|E
