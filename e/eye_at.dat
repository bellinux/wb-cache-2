5|$|IK Pegasi (or HR 8210) is {{a binary}} star {{system in the}} {{constellation}} Pegasus. It is just luminous enough {{to be seen with}} the unaided <b>eye,</b> <b>at</b> a distance of about 150 light years from the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|He {{also showed}} a good <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> the plate. Of 15 Rangers who {{had at least}} 100 at bats, his rate of only one strikeout per 8.31 at-bats was the best on the team. Similarly, he made contact on 87% of his swings, the best contact rate on the team.|$|E
5|$|He {{was little}} known {{personally}} to the English public.

5|$|Viewing the Sun through light-concentrating optics such as {{binoculars}} {{may result}} in permanent damage to the retina without an appropriate filter that blocks UV and substantially dims the sunlight. When using an attenuating filter to view the Sun, the viewer is cautioned to use a filter specifically designed for that use. Some improvised filters that pass UV or IR rays, can actually harm the <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> high brightness levels.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} exist {{that are of}} interest to astronomers. Taurus hosts two of the nearest open clusters to Earth, the Pleiades and the Hyades, {{both of which are}} visible to the naked <b>eye.</b> <b>At</b> first magnitude, the red giant Aldebaran is the brightest star in the constellation. In the northwest part of Taurus is the supernova remnant Messier 1, more commonly known as the Crab Nebula. One of the closest regions of active star formation, the Taurus-Auriga complex, crosses into {{the northern part of the}} constellation. The variable star T Tauri is the prototype of a class of pre-main-sequence stars.|$|E

5|$|Other {{approaches}} {{have been suggested}} over time, including cooling the water under a tropical cyclone by towing icebergs into the tropical oceans. Other ideas range from covering the ocean in a substance that inhibits evaporation, dropping large quantities of ice into the <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> very early stages of development (so that the latent heat is absorbed by the ice, instead of being converted to kinetic energy that would feed the positive feedback loop), or blasting the cyclone apart with nuclear weapons. Project Cirrus even involved throwing dry ice on a cyclone. These approaches all suffer from one flaw above many others: tropical cyclones are simply too large and short-lived {{for any of the}} weakening techniques to be practical.|$|E
5|$|Queer Eye for the Straight Guy debuted during 2003, {{and quickly}} became a {{surprise}} success. The success of the series resulted in merchandising, franchising of the concept internationally, and a woman-oriented spin-off, Queer Eye for the Straight Girl. Queer Eye won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Reality Program during 2004. The series' name was abbreviated to Queer <b>Eye</b> <b>at</b> the beginning of its third season to represent the show's change from making over only heterosexual men to including women and homosexual men. Queer Eye ended production during 2006 June and the final ten episodes were broadcast during October 2007. The series ended October 30. During September 2008, the Fine Living Network briefly aired Queer Eye in syndication.|$|E
5|$|Beta, Gamma, and Iota Serpentis form a {{distinctive}} triangular shape marking {{the head of}} the snake, with Kappa Serpentis being roughly midway between Gamma and Iota. The brightest of the four with an apparent magnitude of roughly 3.67, Beta Serpentis is a white main-sequence star roughly 160 parsecs distant. It is likely that a nearby 10th-magnitude star is physically associated with Beta, although it is not certain. The Mira variable R Serpentis, situated between Beta and Gamma, is visible to the naked <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> its maximum of 5th-magnitude, but, typical of Mira variables, it can fade to below magnitude 14. Gamma Serpentis itself is an F-type subgiant located only 11 parsecs distant and thus is quite bright, being of magnitude 3.84 ± 0.05. The star is known to show solar-like oscillations.|$|E

5|$|Hurricane Dean {{intensified}} {{through the}} night of August19 and reinforced its completed eyewall replacement cycle by forming a tight single-walled <b>eye.</b> <b>At</b> 0100UTC August20, the storm passed 120mi (190km) {{to the south of}} Sea Buoy42056, which recorded a significant wave height of 36ft (11m). A concentric eyewall was briefly observed again on the morning of August20, but it did not last long. In conditions of low wind shear, Hurricane Dean moved westward over waters with increasingly high heat content, and the storm exhibited a classic upper-tropospheric outflow pattern. The high pressure system over the southeastern United States continued to steer the storm west towards the Yucatán Peninsula. The eyewall became even better defined throughout the day. The cloud tops cooled, the minimum central pressure fell, and its winds increased to 160mph (260km/h), making Hurricane Dean a Category5 hurricane once again. This time, it was less than 210mi (335km) from its first landfall.|$|E
5|$|P. sinensis {{is readily}} {{distinguished}} {{from all other}} species by numerous features of the skull. Adult skulls are smaller than those of P. mongoliensis and have less teeth. Uniquely, the premaxillary bone contacts the jugal (cheek) bone {{on the outside of}} the skull. The jugals flare out sideways, forming 'horns' proportionally wider than in any other known Psittacosaurus species except P. sibiricus and P. lujiatunensis. Because of the flared cheeks, the skull is actually wider than it is long. A smaller 'horn' is present behind the <b>eye,</b> <b>at</b> the contact of the jugal and postorbital bones, a feature also seen in P. sibiricus. The mandible (lower jaw) lacks the hollow opening, or fenestra, seen in other species, and the entire lower jaw is bowed outwards, giving the animal the appearance of an underbite. The skull of an adult P. sinensis can reach 11.5centimeters (4.5in) in length.|$|E
5|$|Ando rapidly {{intensified}} after forming and attained {{tropical cyclone}} status early on January4, developing an {{eye in the}} center of the thunderstorms and outflow to the east. A tropical low over the southern Mozambique Channel weakened the ridge, causing Ando to turn more to the southwest. Late on January4, the storm intensified further into an intense tropical cyclone, and early the next day passed about 120km (75mi) northeast of Tromelin Island. According to the JTWC, however, Ando attained peak 1minute winds of 220km/h (140mph) late on January5. In contrast, the MFR assessed Ando as weakening due to the becoming larger and less defined, while still maintaining a small cloud diameter of about 400km (250mi). However, the eye re-organized, and Ando attained peak 10minute winds of 195km/h (120mph) on January6, with a 60km (35mi) <b>eye</b> <b>at</b> the time. Continuing around the ridge, the cyclone passed about 205km (125mi) west of Réunion that day before starting to weaken due to increased wind shear. On January8, Ando weakened below tropical cyclone status, and the convection increasingly separated from the circulation while turning to the southeast. On January10, the storm became extratropical, although the remnants turned back to the northwest due to the ridge, dissipating on January13.|$|E

5|$|More {{favorable}} conditions {{allowed the}} storm to intensify more on July8. Around that time, the storm turned {{more to the}} northwest due to a ridge exiting China, bringing the storm southwest of western Taiwan. At 00:00UTC on July8, the JMA estimated peak 10minute winds of 95km/h (60mph), making it a severe tropical storm. The JTWC assessed further strengthening, upgrading Linfa to typhoon status at 18:00UTC that day based on a developing well-defined <b>eye.</b> <b>At</b> that time, the agency estimated peak 1minute winds of 120km/h (75mph). Early on July9, the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) sent a reconnaissance aircraft into the storm, which measured winds of near hurricane-force, as well as gale-force winds 100km (60mi) from the center. As the storm approached the southern China coast, the eye expanded to a diameter of 37km (23mi), while the thunderstorms on the northern periphery diminished. Around 03:00UTC on July9, Linfa made landfall east of Hong Kong near Lufeng, Guangdong, and it quickly weakened once over land. The storm turned westward, inland and parallel to the southern Chinese coastline. As the thunderstorms diminished, the surface sustained winds continued to drop. At 18:00UTC on July9, the JTWC issued their final advisory for Linfa, and shortly after the JMA downgraded the storm to a tropical depression. The system turned to the southwest, dissipating over open waters on July10 {{off the coast of}} Guangdong province.|$|E
5|$|The ITCZ became {{active in}} the middle of March {{northeast}} of Madagascar, which spawned two low pressure areas on March15. The westernmost became a tropical disturbance on the next day between Madagascar and Tromelin. It quickly intensified while tracking to the southwest and was named Justine on March17. On March18, the storm intensified into tropical cyclone status and developed a well-defined <b>eye.</b> <b>At</b> 15:00UTC that day, Justine moved ashore northeastern Madagascar near Sambava. It continued southwestward and weakened over the island, emerging into the Mozambique Channel near Besalampy as a tropical storm. It re-intensified into a tropical cyclone over waters, reaching peak winds of 150km/h (95mph) on March22 only 20km (12mi) offshore Mozambique. That day, a ridge over southern Africa steered Justine to the southeast away from land, although the ridge weakened and allowed the storm to move back to the west-southwest. It weakened to a tropical storm during this time. The storm turned again to the southeast on March24 after the ridge moved to the east. Justine passed north of Europa Island before striking Madagascar again early on March25 just north of Toliara. It became extratropical over land, and soon again reached open waters while turning to the south. Justine dissipated on March27 within the flow of the westerlies.|$|E
5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{continued to}} intensify, and attained Category 2 hurricane intensity by 0600 UTC on August 7. At {{around the same}} time, the S.S. Lempira reported a minimum pressure of 971 mbar (hPa; 28.70 inHg), while 30 miles (50 km) southeast of Jupiter, Florida. At the time, maximum sustained winds were estimated at 105 mph (170 km/h); {{this would be the}} hurricane's peak intensity. The hurricane weakened slightly before making landfall on central Florida, just southeast of Fort Pierce, Florida, at 0700 UTC the following day. Winds at landfall were estimated at 100 mph (160 km/h), with a minimum central pressure of 977 mbar (28.85 inHg) recorded in Fort Pierce within the hurricane's <b>eye.</b> <b>At</b> the time, the system's maximum winds extended up to 10 mi (15 km) from the center of circulation. The storm then slowly crossed the Florida peninsula, before entering the Gulf of Mexico the next day near Tampa, Florida, after having weakened down to tropical storm strength. Despite remaining over water, its close proximity to the continent prevented further strengthening. The tropical storm recurved to the north in the gulf, before making a second landfall near Apalachicola, Florida at 0400 UTC on August 10 with winds of 40 mph (65 km/h). Moving inland, the system rapidly weakened as it continued to recurve to the northeast, further degenerating to tropical depression strength at 0000 UTC on August 11 while situated over Georgia. Based on weather station observations, the storm was analyzed to have transitioned into an extratropical cyclone later that day. The extratropical storm strengthened slightly over the Mid-Atlantic states, before exiting into the Atlantic Ocean near the Virginia Capes. The storm system progressed eastward across the ocean before dissipating at 1800 UTC on August 14.|$|E
