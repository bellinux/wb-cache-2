5000|$|There is much {{confusion}} with the terminology “discount rate” because {{the term is}} used in different ways. The discount rate referred to in a <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction</b> is similar to an interest rate associated with home loans, credit cards and car loans where the interest rate {{is applied to the}} payment stream itself. In a <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction,</b> the factoring company knows the payment stream they are going to purchase and applies an interest rate to the payment stream itself and solves for the funding amount, as though it was a loan. [...] Discount rates from factoring companies to consumers can range anywhere between 8% up to over 18% but usually average somewhere in the middle. Factoring discount rates can be a bit higher when compared to home loan interest rates, due to the fact the factoring transactions are more of a boutique product for investors opposed to the mainstream collateralized mortgage transactions.|$|E
50|$|A {{structured}} settlement <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction</b> means {{a transfer}} of structured settlement payment rights (including portions of structured settlement payments) made for consideration by means of sale, assignment, pledge, or other form of encumbrance or alienation for consideration. In order for such transfer to be approved, the transfer must comply with Internal Revenue Code section 5891 and any applicable state structured settlement protection law.|$|E
50|$|The above {{description}} {{illustrates a}} single <b>factor</b> <b>transaction.</b> Credentials {{can be passed}} around, thus subverting the access control list. For example, Alice has access rights to the server room, but Bob does not. Alice either gives Bob her credential, or Bob takes it; he now {{has access to the}} server room. To prevent this, two-factor authentication can be used. In a two <b>factor</b> <b>transaction,</b> the presented credential and a second factor are needed for access to be granted; another factor can be a PIN, a second credential, operator intervention, or a biometric input.|$|R

50|$|The {{discount}} rate is the fee a factoring company charges {{to provide the}} factoring service. Since a formal <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction</b> involves the outright purchase of the invoice, the {{discount rate}} is typical stated {{as a percentage of}} the face value of the invoices. For instance, a factoring company may charge 5% for an invoice due in 45 days. In contrast, companies that do accounts receivable financing may charge per week or per month. Thus, an invoice financing company that charges 1% per week would result in a discount rate of 6-7% for the same invoice.|$|E
5000|$|Internal Revenue Code Sec. 5891 {{and most}} state laws require that a court {{find that a}} {{proposed}} settlement <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction</b> {{be in the best}} interest of the seller, taking into account the welfare and support of any dependents. “Best interest” is generally not defined, which gives judges flexibility to make a subjective determination on a case-by-case basis. Some state laws may require that the judge look at factors such as the “purpose of the intended use of the funds,” the payee’s mental and physical capacity, and the seller’s potential need for future medical treatment. One Minnesota court described the “best interest standard” as a determination involving “a global consideration of the facts, circumstances, and means of support available to the payee and his or her dependents.” ...|$|E
50|$|A {{structured}} settlement <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction</b> is a {{means to}} raise liquidity {{where there is no}} other viable means, via the transfer of structured settlement payment rights, for items such as unforeseen medical expenses, the need for improved housing or transportation, education expenses and the like, or in a situation where the individual has simply spent all his or her cash. To meet this need, the structured settlement recipient may involve the sale (or, less commonly, the encumbrance) of all or part of certain future periodic payments for a lump sum. Generally such lump sums are discounted. If a person sells the structured settlement payment rights, he or she will never receive the full amount of the payments originally contracted for when the individual settled his or her case and the structured settlement was established. A judge must review the submission and determine that the structured settlement transfer {{is in the best interest}} of the payee and any applicable dependents.|$|E
5000|$|Spot factoring, {{or single}} invoice discounting, is an {{alternative}} to [...] "whole ledger" [...] and allows a company to factor a single invoice. The added flexibility for the business, and lack of predictable volume and monthly minimums for factoring providers means that spot <b>factoring</b> <b>transactions</b> usually carry a cost premium.|$|R
5000|$|Another term {{commonly}} used in <b>factoring</b> <b>transactions</b> is “discounted present value,” which is defined in the National Conference of Insurance Legislators's model transfer act as “{{the present value of}} future payments determined by discounting such payments to the present using the most recently published Applicable Federal Rate for determining the present value of an annuity, as issued by the United States Internal Revenue Service.” ...|$|R
50|$|Traditionally, {{factoring}} {{has been}} a relationship driven business and <b>factoring</b> <b>transactions</b> have been largely manual and frequently involving a face to-face component {{as part of the}} relationship building process or due-diligence phase. This is especially true for small business factoring, in which the factoring companies tend to be locally or regionally focused. The geographic focus helps them better mitigate risks that because of their smaller scale, they otherwise couldn’t afford to take.|$|R
5000|$|A {{claimant}} who {{has agreed}} to a negotiated structured settlement elects to receive part of their settlement money {{at the time of}} settlement, and part of their settlement money in the future through a negotiated, customized schedule of periodic payments that are [...] "fixed and determinable as to amount and time of payment." [...] The life insurance companies who underwrite these periodic payment obligations and the associated qualified assignment companies, must comply with the Internal Revenue Code 130, which, in part, does not allow for acceleration or modification of payments. Options exist for structured settlement annuitants to sell or transfer the rights to future periodic payments to purchasers of structured settlement payment rights, mostly known as structured settlement factoring companies. Some life insurers, such as Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska, and former structured annuity issuers Allstate Life Insurance Company and Symetra, offer to buy part or all of one's structured settlement payment rights in return for a lump sum cash provided such transaction complies with IRC §5891. The act of the sale and purchase of structured settlement payment rights is known as a structured settlement <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction.</b>|$|E
50|$|The “discounted present value” is a {{measuring}} stick for determining what {{the value of}} a future payment (i.e., a payment that is due in the year 2057) is today. Hence, the discounted present value of a payment corrects for inflation and the principle that money available today is worth more than money not accessible for 50 years (or some future time). However, the discounted present value {{is not the same thing}} as market value (what someone is willing to pay). Basically, a calculation that discounts a future payment based on IRS rates is an artificial number since it has no bearing on the payment’s actual selling price. For example, in Henderson Receivables Origination, it is somewhat confusing for the court to evaluate future payments totaling $63,364,94 based the discounted present value of $50,933.18 because that is not the market value of the payments. In other words, the annuitant couldn’t go out and get $50,933.18 for his future payments because no person or company would be willing to pay that much.Some states will require a quotient to be listed on the disclosure that is sent to the customer prior to entering into a contract with a factoring company. The quotient is calculated by dividing the purchase price by the discounted present value. The quotient (like the discounted present value) provides no relevance in the pricing of a settlement <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction.</b> In Henderson Receivables Origination, the court did consider this quotient which was calculated as 71.70% ($36,500/ $50,933.18).|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of factoring {{apply to all}} the parties involved in the transaction. There are always three different parties to each <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction.</b> The first is the customer or buyer. The second is the supplier or seller. The third is the factor. All three parties have benefits when a successful <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction</b> takes place. The recent economic times have put a crimp in small business profits, so small business people nationwide {{are looking for ways}} to cut business costs, and many are suffering from the fact that their customers are not paying on time, if at all. factoring, cash-flow, market, finance, working capital, credit, business, deal...|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} giving general {{information}} about factoring, {{which is an}} alternative financing technique, regarding {{the recognition of the}} <b>factoring</b> <b>transactions</b> within the scope of the Turkish Accounting Standards, by presenting a sample application in particular regard of an export transaction in relation to the accounting records which have to be done by the company that gives factoring service and receives the factoring service, a contribution to the accounting literature is put forward. In the study, it is shown that, even though the Uniform Accounting Plan which the factoring companies and the companies which use a factoring service in their accounting records differ from each other, recognition of it within the scope of the Turkish Accounting Standards is a basis. The fundamental principle of the accounting records of the company which assigns the receivables that generate from the exporting by entering into an agreement of factoring is the recognition of the income according to the fair value, by reflecting the amount which the income waits to gain the when assigning, and by separating the income which is actualised and not actualised.

40|$|AbstractIn the {{changing}} financial environment {{characterized by the}} high level of credit, default and liquidity risks, factoring supports firms to manage the required level of liquidity and offers them the advantage of obtaining further price discounts from suppliers. This is particularly important in the service industry due to the particular risks inherent in this sector and {{because of the lack of}} sufficient security. The goal of the authors is financial and legal analysis of factoring in {{the changing}} environment. The authors analyze the main features, benefits and costs of factoring implementation by small and medium enterprises (with a particular emphasis on the use of factoring in the service sector), and show that the use of factoring can improve profitability, liquidity and cash-flow of business, management of time, credit and default risks. However, the use of factoring is limited because of many restrictions and hidden cost coming from the legal environment.

40|$|International audienceA {{recent report}} {{issued by the}} US-based audit company Ernst & Young (2006) stated that, in 2005, 23 out of the 39 French CAC 40 index {{companies}} initiated assets transfers. More specifically, 6 companies operated as transferee while 32 as assignor. Those transactions were mainly concerned with securitization and credit factoring issues. Besides, in 69 % of the assets transfer cases, the companies did not derecognize the credit assets and {{only half of the}} listed firms under scrutiny provided additional disclosure regarding these operations. Similar observations can be made in other European continental countries (see Escaffre and Ramond, 2007; IFRIC, 2006 a). This result highlights the current heterogeneity around the accounting treatment related to financial asset derecognition under international accounting standards and more specifically under IAS 39. Although IAS 39 contends that a financial asset derecognition should imply the transfer of both its contractual rights and most of its inherent risks to a counterparty, it fails to provide any readily-applicable models or methodologies necessary to meet these two criteria. Adopting the perspective from a credit <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction</b> ruled by civil code-based provisions, this paper aims to shed into light the potential current ambiguity and technicality surrounding the IAS 39 day-to-day application. For doing so, it first presents the IAS 39 derecognition features and then through a simple setting-based example discuss the (de) recognition of a credit assets transfer under IFRS while underlining some institutional perspectives for future standard interpretations...|$|E

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the thesis is to assess {{factoring}} {{as a tool for}} small and medium size enterprises financing. Factoring offers receivables management, securing of debtors risk and support of national and international trade. The target is to sum up theoretical approaches in Czech as well as international literature and connect them with practice knowledge and experience that the author have learned during expert experience. Factoring was successfully offered in course of bad economic times during worldwide recession mainly to due easy availability in the markets. Financing via factoring expresses lower risk for financing party, due to transaction risk spread being on the more debtors. In contrast, there is higher demand on administration of every single invoice of company to its debtors. This logically brings higher cost of manpower on the financing party site that has to deal with high proportion of invoices. The thesis is divided into five parts. First parts is taking care about state and private trade supporting tools including Czech Export Bank and its role in creating space for national exporters. Second part deals with forms, in which small and medium size enterprise can find the suitable financial tools and products. Receivables and its main features, receivables live cycle and tools for effective use of receivable in asset based financing, that is all proceeded in part with number three. Whereas chapter four analyze current latest experience with factoring, its forms and way of use including legal and accountancy view. Fifth chapter summarizes theoretical background and uses the application of theory in practice and presents examples, how factoring can help. The thesis found out, that factoring is a suitable financing tool in times of economic crisis and general downturn. The number of <b>factoring</b> <b>transaction</b> grew, as well as the total turnover, but average transaction price went down due to lower cost of traded goods, that was financed via factoring. Thesis also proved that factoring financing is easy to get in the market, as there is large scale of big and small factoring financing providers. Factoring did not improve all significant financial ratios, but increased turnover of assets, mainly receivables, decreased the ratio of indebtedness. Thesis introduced the factoring financing, its use, forms and pros as well as cons. Factoring provided to be sufficient substitute for conventional credit, but bears differences, that have to be taken into account, when deciding on suitable form of receivable financing...|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Congress passed HR 2884, {{signed into}} law by the President in 2002 and {{effective}} July 1, 2002, codified at Internal Revenue Code § 5891. Through a punitive excise tax penalty, this has created the de facto regulatory paradigm for the factoring industry. In essence, to avoid the excise tax penalty, IRC 5891 requires that all structured settlement <b>factoring</b> <b>transactions</b> be approved by a state court, in accordance with a qualified state statute. Qualified state statutes must make certain baseline findings, including that the transfer {{is in the best interest}} of the seller, taking into account the welfare and support of any dependents. In response, many states enacted statutes regulating structured settlement transfers in accord with this mandate.|$|R
50|$|An {{example of}} measurement, one of North’s four <b>factors</b> of <b>transaction</b> costs, is {{detailed}} in Mancur Olson’s work Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development (1993) - Olson writes that roving bandits calculate {{the success of}} their banditry based on how much money they can take from their citizens. Enforcement, the second of North's <b>factors</b> of <b>transaction</b> costs, is exemplified in Diego Gambetta’s book The Sicilian Mafia: the Business of Private Protection (1996). Gambetta describes the concept of the “Peppe,” who occupies the role of mediator in dealings with the Sicilian mafia - the Peppe is needed because it is not certain that both parties will maintain their end of the deal. Measurement and enforcement comprise North’s third factor, ideological attitudes and perceptions - each individual’s views influence how they go about each transaction.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify factors determining a business investment strategy (i. e., the choice of investment commitment and form of organizational structure) in the food manufacturing, chemical, agricultural wholesaling and biotechnology industries. Propositions regarding strategic alliance theories are tested on over 400 inter-firm collaborative agreements using secondary data from major US and European companies for the 1994 - 97 period. Results suggest that transactions with lower technological and resource uncertainty levels are more likely to result in investments with a higher commitment level (i. e., acquisitions or majority equity-based controlling investments). The investment commitment level embedded in a single business transaction seems to be affected not only by a goal of cost minimization, but also by strategic motives and firm and industry <b>factors.</b> <b>Transaction</b> costs, strategic alliances, food manufacturing, chemical, agricultural wholesaling, ag-biotechnology, investment strategy, innovation...|$|R

Our "Tinkertoy" approach towards building transactions enables us to construct a model of concurrent, nested, multi-threaded transactions, as well as other non-traditional models where not all features of transactions are present. Key to our approach is the use of higher-order functions to make transactions first-class. Not only do we get clean composability of transactional features, but also we avoid the need to introduce special control and block-structured constructs as done in more traditional transactional systems. We implemented our design in Standard ML of New Jersey.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a new {{framework for the}} dynamic modelling of univariate and multivariate point processes. The so-called latent factor intensity (LFI) model {{is based on the}} assumption that the intensity function consists of univariate or multivariate observation driven dynamic components and a univariate dynamic latent factor. In this sense, the model corresponds to a dynamic extension of a doubly stochastic Poisson process. We illustrate alternative parameterizations of the observation driven component based on autoregressive conditional intensity (ACI) specifications, as well as Hawkes types models. Based on simulation studies, it is shown that the proposed model provides a flexible tool to capture the joint dynamics of multivariate point processes. Since the latent component has to be integrated out, the model is estimated by simulated maximum likelihood based upon efficient importance sampling techniques. Applications of univariate and bivariate LFI models to transaction data extracted from the German XETRA trading system provide evidence for an improvement of the econometric specification when observable as well as unobservable dynamic components are taken into account. multivariate point process, latent <b>factor,</b> <b>transaction</b> durations, efficient importance sampling...|$|R
