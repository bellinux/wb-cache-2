It's the same thing whether {{you look at the}} suffrage business or the labour people or at this Irish muddle. People may be too safe. You see we live {{at the end of a}} series of secure generations in which none of the great things of life have changed materially. We've grown up with no sense of danger--that is to say, with no sense of responsibility. None of us, none of us--for though I talk my actions belie me--really believe that life can change very fundamentally any more forever. All this",--Mr. Britling waved his arm comprehensively--"looks as though it was bound to go on steadily forever. It seems incredible that the system could be smashed. It seems incredible that anything we can do will ever smash the system. Lady Homartyn, for example, is incapable of believing that she won't always be able to have week-end parties at Claverings, and that the letters and the tea won't come to her bedside in the morning. Or if her imagination goes to the point of supposing that some day she won't be there to receive the tea, it means merely that she supposes somebody else will be. Her pleasant butler may fear to lose his 'situation,' but nothing on earth could make him imagine a time when there will not be a 'situation' for him to lose. Old Asquith thinks that we always have got along, and that we always shall get along by being quietly artful and saying, 'Wait and see.' And it's just because we are all convinced that we are so safe against a general breakdown that we are able to be so recklessly violent in our special cases. Why shouldn't women have the vote? they argue. What does it matter? And bang goes a bomb in Westminster Abbey. Why shouldn't Ulster create an impossible position? And off trots some demented Carsonite to Germany to play at treason on some <b>half</b> <b>word</b> of the German Emperor's and buy half a million rifles....|$|E

The {{remainder of the}} left <b>half</b> <b>word</b> specified the operation. The first three bits after the sign specified an index register. The following bits specified an instruction class, class variation and instruction-dependent auxiliary information.

50|$|Associated {{with the}} memory is a half-word {{insertion}} register of 42-bit capacity. Each bit is temporarily stored in a magnetic core of this register during a memory reference. Each of these register cores is associated {{with one of the}} 42 memory planes. To write into the memory, {{the first half of the}} word is placed in the insertion register and the address selector alerts the appropriate column and the proper row of the top section in each of the 42 planes. At the appropriate instant the information is transferred from each core of the insertion register to the selected core in the corresponding plane of the memory. 42 pulse times later, the second <b>half</b> <b>word</b> has been placed in the insertion register and the process is repeated in the lower section of the memory. Read-outs are accomplished in a reverse manner. The speed of the memory has been adjusted to the speed of the arithmetic portion of the Univac which permits the transfer into or out of the memory of 12 characters in 40 microseconds. Word pulses flow from or to the high speed bus and the insertion register via a mechanism which converts from serial to parallel and vice versa, in 42 bit modules.|$|E
40|$|The Navier-Stokes {{equations}} are solved numerically. These equations are unsteady, compressible, viscous, and three-dimensional without neglecting any terms. The time dependency of {{the governing}} equations allows the solution to progress naturally for an arbitrary initial guess to an asymptotic steady state, if one exists. The equations are transformed from physical coordinates to the computational coordinates, allowing the solution {{of the governing}} equations in a rectangular parallelepiped domain. The equations are solved by the MacCormack time-split technique which is vectorized and programmed to run on the CDc VPS 32 computer. The codes are written in 32 -bit (<b>half</b> <b>word)</b> FORTRAN, which provides an approximate factor of two decreasing in computational time and doubles the memory size compared to the 54 -bit word size...|$|E
40|$|In large {{vocabulary}} {{continuous speech}} recognition (LVCSR) for agglutinative languages, we encounter problems due to theoretically infinite full-word lexicon size. Sub-word lexicon units may be utilized to dramatically reduce the out-of-vocabulary rate in test data. One can develop language models based on sub-word units to perform LVCRS. However, {{it has not}} always been beneficial to use sub-word lexicon units, since shorter units have higher acoustic confusability among them and language model history is effectively shorter as compared to the history in full-world language models. To reduce the aforementioned problems, we propose using the longest possible sub-word units in our lexicon, namely half-words and full-words only. We also incorporate linguistic rules of <b>half</b> <b>word</b> combination into our statistical language model. The language constraints are represented with a rule -based WFSM, which can be combined with an N-gram language model to yield a better and smaller language model. We study the performance of the proposed system for Turkish LVCRS when the language constraint takes the form of enforcing vowel harmony between stems and endings. We also introduce novel error-rate metrics that are more appropriate than word-error-rate for agglutinative languages. Using half-words with a bi-gram full-word model. In addition, combining a tri-gram half-word language model with the vowel-harmony WFSM significantly improves the accuracy further when re-scoring the bi-gram lattices...|$|E

Coordinates normally occur as a dotted pair (x. y) in <b>half</b> <b>words.</b> For display purposes, normally the 10 most significant bits are used, but higher resolution options will be available. To specify a sub-array we have to state its size, location and mesh. All sub-arrays will be square.
