500|$|Adam LaClave and Paul Meany {{were the}} primary songwriters for Earthsuit. As Christians, the two wrote lyrics that often communicated a Christian message. For example, the song [...] "Said the Sun" [...] is an allegory about God telling Christians to be {{carriers}} of light. [...] "Whitehorse" [...] was written to present {{a different view of}} the return of Jesus, as LaClave stated in an interview, [...] "Most people, when they hear the term [...] "white horse," [...] think of the analogy of Jesus coming back ... wanted to bring a different meaning to it, because ... He comes to rescue us in our everyday life [...]" [...] The men's lyrics also reflect experiences they have had. Meany once had a dream that inspired him to write [...] "Gummy Buffalo"; he found himself in a candy store and squeezed a gummy buffalo whereupon he heard the melody for the song. Christianity Today has proposed the lyrics in [...] "Foreign" [...] may have been inspired by their departure from Sparrow Records. The lyrics read [...] "There's no place in your world for me / I've been from sea to shining sea / And I can't retain your policies, <b>excuse</b> <b>me</b> / If I'm just hanging around, I'm foreign." ...|$|E

500|$|Gerstmann noted [...] "a raw {{collection}} of messy operations", while Edge praised the game's [...] "inventiveness" [...] - saying it [...] "makes Soviet Strike" [...] - {{as well as}} the variety added by the games artificial intelligence. The magazine also felt that while the collecting of supplies added strategy to the action, the limited amount restricted the paths the player might take through the level. Another critic said the [...] "real-time, living battlefield enhances the urgency of the missions and the player's involvement" [...] and also noted [...] "practically no load time." [...] GameFan complained of a high difficulty and a steep curve, long levels which return the player to the beginning should he die, infrequent opportunities to repair armour and the enemies' tendency to attack the player from beyond his limited viewpoint, and was thankful for the Saturn version's optional easier difficulty setting. Next Generation also criticised the player's restricted view, calling it the game's [...] "worst problem". One reviewer said revisiting levels to discover missed set pieces aided the game's longevity; Sega Saturn Magazine had [...] "some reservations" [...] about the game's replay-value, with only 5 missions, but said it was [...] "very playable and enjoyable", while another reviewer called it [...] "a load of fun". Gerstmann criticised the poor scrolling, erratic motion and imprecise control, Great Drakon praised the controls, while GameFan noted they had improved in the Saturn version. The reviewer also enjoyed this version's new weaponry. Another reviewer pointed to some [...] "minor flaws", saying the HUD [...] "smacks of 16-bit era graphics"; The game impressed Great Drakons reviewer, who praised the attention to detail and the reviewer found the story convincing. IGN said: [...] "Everything about this game is great. <b>Excuse</b> <b>me</b> for gushing, but when you come across a game that's as fun to play as Soviet Strike, and great looking, you really sit up and take notice." ...|$|E
