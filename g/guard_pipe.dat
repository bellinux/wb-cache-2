30|$|As {{a result}} of the above findings, for this study, we assumed a service life of 10  years for painted wooden beams, 20  years for pressure-injected wooden beams, 40  years for the steel beam and support posts of the wooden guardrails, and 40  years for all {{components}} of the steel guardrails and <b>guard</b> <b>pipes.</b> Therefore, we set the maintenance and management period at 40  years, and assumed replacement of wooden beams (wooden beam material procurement, production, and construction) in the wooden guardrails after their service lives of 10 or 20  years. In addition, since it was reported that {{there was no difference between}} Japanese cedar and larch in terms of service life of wooden materials [23], we did not consider the difference of tree species for service life in this study.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Sweden, around 10 % of {{the energy}} {{supplied}} to the district heating networks are lost through heat losses from the distribution pipes. In cylindrical geometries it is preferable to improve the insulation {{as close to the}} center as possible. This has resulted in a hybrid insulation district heating pipe concept with a combination of vacuum insulation panels at the center, held in place by polyurethane foam. In the twin pipe concept, the vacuum insulation panel cover the supply pipe. This creates a complex temperature profile over the section and measured results on single pipes might not be applicable. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a method to evaluate the improvement of hybrid insulation twin pipes in the laboratory. This paper presents a method where two <b>guarded</b> hot <b>pipe</b> apparatuses is used, one heating rod for each pipe, to measure the heat losses from hybrid pipes and compare to a conventional polyurethane pipe. The measurements indicate an improvement in thermal performance by 12 %- 18 % for the total losses and by 29 % - 39 % for the supply pipe losses...|$|R
5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} buzzer near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the <b>guards</b> to <b>pipes</b> and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|R

5000|$|In 1916, the British army {{regiment}} the Irish <b>Guards</b> {{established a}} <b>pipe</b> band. The pipers' uniform was {{a mix of}} standard service dress and bandsman dress, and also included a khaki bonnet, saffron-coloured kilts and green hose. The khaki bonnet was named [...] "caubeen" [...] by the Guards pipers, and was similar to an oversized beret. Some sources have stated the caubeen's similarity to the Scottish tam o' shanter, but the two are different in appearance - the tam o' shanter retaining {{much more of a}} 'dinner-plate' effect on the wearer's head, while the caubeen resembled an oversized beret. The two had different quartermaster codes, meaning that the caubeen was not simply a tam o' shanter with the toorie cut off, but a purpose-made article in its own right. In World War II, a number of British army regiments adopted both khaki and rifle-green caubeens as their headdress, replacing the GS cap.|$|R
50|$|The 2002-03 {{season began}} with a rapid start, winning their first 4 of 5 with Braydon Cox leading the way and Chris Denman <b>guarding</b> the <b>pipes</b> once again. Then the injury bug hit the Cru where it hurts. In the pregame warmup before a game in Drayton Valley, a player fell on Chris Denman, tearing muscles in his leg. Around this time, second year Conor Shields was traded to Bonnyville for Chris Baker and Ryan Rarmuch. This deal was heavily criticized at the time, but has turned out as a steal for the Crusaders. There were few {{solutions}} to the goaltending problem, leaving the team to pick up Anton Wintner from the WHL. Female rookie sensation Shannon Szabados came to the helm for eight games, earning 2 shutouts and a 7-1 record. She probably would have stayed with the team, for it not have been an AMHL rule for players only to play 8 games or that team will forfeit their rights to sign Midget players. Garret Kindred was on loan to the Lloydminster Blazers, so the Crusaders were in luck when Gerry Festa returned from a tryout with the Saskatoon Blades. After only 7 games, he was signed by the Calgary Hitmen of the WHL and was gone once again. After many different goalie changes, Chris Denman returned to a still very good team. Braydon Cox led the team in scoring, but was supported well {{by the likes of}} Sean Dersch and Michael Ringrose. The Cru made a few late season pick-ups from the WHL including Nick Chibi and David Selthun and a trade with the Flin Flon Bombers of the MJHL for goalie Bryan Dafoe.|$|R
40|$|The {{interest}} {{for reducing the}} energy consumption in society has increased during the last decades due to an increased environmental awareness. One way to decrease the energy losses in the building sector {{is to improve the}} thermal insulation of building envelopes and installations and thereby decrease the heat losses. This thesis analyzes two types of novel insulation with low thermal conductivity; aerogel blankets and vacuum insulation panels. The thesis aims to investigate the possible benefits from using these novel insulations, but also to evaluate new considerations related to the high insulation performance. The insulations have been tested in two applications: 1. 	A wooden stud wall with aerogel blankets as insulation 2. 	Hybrid insulated district heating pipes where aerogel blankets or vacuum insulation panels have been wrapped around the carrier pipe and polyurethane have been used to fill the rest of the casing pipe. Thermal properties and moisture properties have been measured in laboratory by guarded heat flow meter, <b>guarded</b> hot <b>pipe,</b> transient plane source and wet cup method. District heating pipes with vacuum insulation panels have also been measured in field. The measured properties have been used in numerical simulations to evaluate the heat losses and the risk of moisture related damages for both applications. The studies show promising results for aerogel blanket insulated walls where the wall thickness was reduced by 40 percent compared to a conventional Swedish wall. However, the effect on the moisture conditions from the thermal bridges through the studs has to be considered in order to avoid damages. For district heating pipes, the vacuum insulation panels showed the most promising results with a decrease in the heat losses by 15 to 25 percent depending on the dimensions of the pipe and the thickness of the vacuum insulation panels. In hybrid insulation double pipes with vacuum insulation, the position of the thermal bridges {{at the edges of the}} panel has a large impact on the total heat losses. The thesis also examines some challenges when measuring the properties of the novel insulation. The thermal conductivity of aerogel blankets improves with an increased compression of the samples. The properties of the curved vacuum insulation panels used in the district heating pipes are difficult to measure since there is an impact from the thermal bridges along the edges, which might be influenced by surrounding materials...|$|R

30|$|Comparing {{the steel}} {{guardrail}} and the steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe,</b> the GHG emissions {{of the steel}} <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> were 127  % of the GHG emissions of the steel guardrail, which was significantly higher. There are two likely reasons for this. First, the <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> has a narrower support post spacing (3  m), and therefore uses {{a larger number of}} support posts with an attendant increase in the emissions associated with the raw material procurement and production of support posts, as well as their construction. Second, the <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> is installed in three tiers of beams, which increases the number of attachment fittings. While the GHG emissions from raw material procurement and production of attachment fittings for the steel guardrail were 1.36  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, the equivalent emissions for the steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> were 6.00  kg-CO 2 -eq/m.|$|E
40|$|An {{apparatus}} and method {{have been developed}} for measuring the rates of leakage of heat into pipes carrying liquids, the purpose of the measurements being to quantify the thermal performance of the insulation system. The apparatus is designed primarily for testing pipes used to carry cryogenic liquids, but can also be used for measuring the thermal performance of other insulated pipes or piping systems. The basic measurement principle is straightforward: The outer surface of the pipe insulation is maintained at a fixed warmer temperature. The interior of the pipe is maintained in a narrow fixed lower-temperature range by means of a regular liquid (e. g., water) that is pumped through the pipe at a known flow rate or a cryogenic liquid (e. g., nitrogen) that is saturated at atmospheric pressure and replenished until steady-state conditions are achieved. In the case of water or another liquid pumped through, the inlet and outlet temperatures are measured and heat-leak power is calculated as the mass flow rate of the liquid multiplied by the specific heat of the liquid multiplied by the inlet-to-outlet temperature rise of the liquid. In the case of liquid nitrogen or another low-temperature boiling liquid, the heat-leak power is calculated as the rate of boil-off multiplied by the latent heat of vaporization of the liquid. Then the thermal-insulation performance of the pipe system can be calculated {{as a function of the}} measured heat-leak power, the inner and outer boundary temperatures, and the dimensions of the pipe. The apparatus can test as many as three pipes simultaneously. The pipes can have inner diameters up to. 15 cm and outer diameters up to. 20 cm. The lengths of the pipes may vary; typical lengths are of the order of 18 m. Two thermal guard boxes. one for each end of the pipe(s) under test. are used to make the inlet and outlet fluid connections to the pipe(s) (see figure). The connections include bellows that accommodate thermal expansion and contraction of the <b>pipes.</b> The <b>guard</b> boxes and <b>pipe(s)</b> are positioned so that the pipe(s) slope upward from the upstream to the downstream end at an angle of at least 2. The upward slope allows vapor bubbles to accumulate at the downstream end. The thermal guard boxes keep the ends of the pipes at the lower interior temperature to prevent spurious lengthwise leakage of heat into the pipes. It is important to prevent this spurious heat leakage because, if it were allowed to occur, it could contribute a large error in the measured heat-leak power. The upstream thermal guard box includes a heat exchanger through which liquid flowing into the pipe(s) is subcooled to the saturation temperature corresponding to the ambient pressure. Conversely, this heat exchanger can also be used to warm the flowing liquid to a desired fixed temperature. The apparatus includes a temperature control device that is placed around each pipe under test. Each device is operated under thermostatic control to maintain the outer surface of the pipe insulation at the specified test temperature. All measurements are recorded on a portable data-acquisition system...|$|R
30|$|Comparing {{the wooden}} {{guardrails}} with the steel guardrail and <b>guard</b> <b>pipe,</b> the GHG emissions {{of the wooden}} type no. 1 {{were significantly higher than}} the emissions of the steel guardrail and steel <b>guard</b> <b>pipe</b> (158 and 125  %, respectively, for the painted case; 175 and 138  %, respectively for the pressure-injected case).

Incidentally, there have recently been examples of the wooden type no. 3 being installed with support post spacing extended from 2 to 3  m, and these have passed the vehicle collision test [35]. There are no such installations within Nagano Prefecture yet; however, the GHG emissions of the pressure-injected case in the example of a 3  m installation with a 20 -year service life are calculated to be 28.34  kg-CO 2 -eq/m, which correspond to about 86  % of the current 2  m example.
