500|$|Azaria played Gargamel in the computer-animated/live-action {{adaptation}} of The Smurfs (2011). Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, buck teeth, eyebrows and a wig, {{as well as}} shaving his head. He spent approximately 130 hours in the make-up chair {{over the course of}} the production. Azaria considered Gargamel's voice to be the most important part of his performance. The producers wanted an [...] "old, failed, Shakespearean actor" [...] voice, but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European. He eventually selected a voice similar to that of Paul Winchell's from the cartoon. Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired, and considered Gargamel too one-dimensional a character and [...] "just this straight villain"; he opted to make Gargamel [...] "more sarcastic" [...] than in the cartoon, but [...] "discovered that there's no way to play Gargamel without screaming your head off at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs". He interpreted him as [...] "very lonely", adding that [...] "he hates the Smurfs because they're such a happy family. He wants in really badly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be embraced as a Smurf". Azaria worked with the writers to [...] "infuse" [...] the script with some of his ideas about the character, [...] "particularly with the 'married' relationship between Gargamel and [...] Azreal [...] " [...] which Azaria conceived.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Criss as Blaine, a gay {{member of}} a rival glee club, the Dalton Academy Warblers. In September 2010, a casting call was released for an actor to portray a [...] "cute, charismatic, gay high school junior" [...] who would lead a competing glee club. Criss had auditioned for Glee several times before, once {{for the role of}} Finn Hudson. The character breakdown for Blaine was the first he believed he had a chance of securing, and indeed his audition was successful. Blaine was introduced primarily as a mentor to Kurt. Criss explained, [...] "At this point, Kurt's [...] has been such a sense of discord in his life. Blaine finds [...] empowering. He embraces who he is, and sees Kurt [...] the same things that he had to deal with, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> impart that knowledge." [...] Murphy described Blaine as a character with [...] "great self-loathing" [...] and regret for having run away from his own tormentors; he intended this to form part of his story arc for the season, as Blaine tries to set right some past mistakes. Neither he nor Criss knew whether Blaine would eventually become Kurt's boyfriend—a role originally intended for new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) until the producers decided to change Sam to heterosexual and paired him with Quinn—but based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy later decided to pair them romantically.|$|E

I do believe that--poor little exquisite wretch!--he wants to speak. Last evening, in the firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours {{as if it were}} just coming." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to utter}} his half {{finished}} proposal, and so bind her.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not express}} himself quite like this. He used {{gestures}} instead of adjectives, and he halted. I have put {{into my own}} words what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to say.|$|R

6000|$|... "Mr. Winters, whom I shall always hate for it, {{has been}} telling that at some battle in Virginia, where he got his hurt, you were seen {{crouching}} behind a tree. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> injure you in my regard, which he knows the story would do if I believed it. I could bear to hear of my soldier lover's death, but not of his cowardice." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2013 Varney {{generated}} controversy for his {{commentary on}} Pope Francis, who had criticized the wealth gap and denounced unfettered capitalism {{as a system}} which [...] "rules rather than serves." [...] Varney stated, [...] "I go to church to save my soul. It’s {{got nothing to do}} with my vote. Pope Francis has linked the two. He has offered direct criticism of a specific political system. He has characterized, negatively, that system. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> influence my politics." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Leslie {{passed her}} up the gangway," [...] said another man, adding, with a suggestive laugh as he {{answered}} another question: [...] "Why did he do it? Well, perhaps he's had his fortune told, or you can ask him. Anyway, although <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to, <b>he</b> dared not turn her back." ...|$|R

60|$|January 12.--Mathews {{last night}} {{gave us a}} very perfect {{imitation}} of old Cumberland, who carried the poetic jealousy and irritability further than any man I ever saw. He was a great flatterer too, the old rogue. Will Erskine used to admire him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> originality. A very high-bred man in point of manners in society.|$|R
5000|$|Stryder began a {{partnership}} with English record producer and songwriter Fraser T Smith. According to Smith {{in an interview with}} HitQuarters, [...] "Kwasi had no shortage of beats and cool sounding production, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to try and break through into the mainstream, and I had some experience crossing underground over into mainstream having worked with artists like Craig David." ...|$|R
5000|$|Jeon candidly {{revealed}} that she adopted [...] "Ha Ji-won" [...] as her stage {{name as a}} favor for her previous manager {{as it was the}} name of his first love. [...] "When I was about to debut, the first love of my manager's name was Ha Ji-won. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to at least use the name of his love that was not fulfilled. The first time I heard the name Ha Ji-won, I thought it was pretty and also bold." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because he is a brute," [...] she {{answered}} quietly. [...] "We have been separated {{for more than}} a year. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to marry again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Personally," [...] {{she told}} him, [...] "I {{believe that it}} is just the call of England to a man who lived very near the soil--her heart. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> the smell of spring flowers, the stillness of an English autumn, the winds of February in the woods he was brought up in. It is a form of heart-sickness, you know. I have felt it myself so often. It is {{scarcely}} possible that after all these years he is still nursing that bitter hatred of us both." ...|$|R
5000|$|On January 20, 2010, Franz Nicolay {{confirmed}} on {{his official}} website {{that he had}} left the band. Regarding his departure, vocalist and guitarist Craig Finn stated: [...] "Franz is a real ambitious guy, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to do a lot of}} different things, and we want to really follow this one Hold Steady thing to its logical end. And it takes up a lot of time. It was an amicable departure, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we all wish him the best. He’ll do a lot of interesting, cool things." ...|$|R
5000|$|Steve Gerber came {{on board}} with issue #97, {{initially}} scripting over Conway's plots, but Gene Colan's long stint as Daredevil's penciler {{had come to an}} end. Gerber recollected, [...] "Gene and I did a few issues together, but Gene was basically trying to move on at that point. He'd just started the Dracula book, and he'd been doing Daredevil for God knows how many years. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to do something else." [...] After six issues with fill-in pencilers, including several with Don Heck, Bob Brown took over as penciller.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, dear. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> to {{quarrel with}} any one;--but above all {{he must not}} quarrel with me. Lord Fawn has quarrelled with him, and that's a misfortune,--just for the present." ...|$|R
5000|$|Andrew Clements of The Guardian said it [...] "ranks {{alongside}} Ligeti's utterly different concerto as {{the most}} important for piano and orchestra since Bartók." [...] The pianists Leif Ove Andsnes and Louis Lortie have similarly considered it {{to be one of the}} great piano concertos of the late 20th century. [...] Lortie said of the piece, [...] "I like it because Lutoslawski isn't trying to go against the nature of the instrument, the way some modern composers do. Lutoslawski was a fine pianist himself, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to create something he himself would enjoy playing." ...|$|R
6000|$|I heard Cavor's {{voice in}} alarm and entreaty. Even then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to {{compromise}} with these creatures. [...] "I say, Bedford," [...] he cried, [...] "I know a way!" [...] But {{the sting of}} that second stab seemed to set free some pent-up reserve of energy in my being. Instantly the link of the wrist-chain snapped, and with it snapped all considerations that had held us unresisting {{in the hands of}} these moon creatures. For that second, at least, I was mad with fear and anger. I took no thought of consequences. I hit straight out at the face of the thing with the goad. The chain was twisted round my fist.|$|R
60|$|The {{next night}} he came again. I should {{say he was}} a bird {{with a sense of}} humour. Thinking this might happen, I had, however, taken the {{precaution}} to have a few stones ready. I opened the window wide, and fired them one after another into the tree. After I had closed the window, he hopped down nearer, and cawed louder than ever. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> me to throw more stones at him: he appeared to regard the whole proceeding as a game. On the third night, as I heard nothing of him, I flattered myself that, in spite of his bravado, I had discouraged him. I might have known rooks better.|$|R
6000|$|... "He'll reach Echo Lodge {{before the}} rain gets very heavy, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Anyway, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to go back}} tonight. Well, I've had a splendid visit, but I'm {{glad to see you}} dear folks again. 'East, west, hame's best.' Davy, have you been growing again lately?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> outside now. <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> what <b>he</b> <b>wants.</b> Would you--would {{you mind}} being {{kind enough to}} go and send him away?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Jacobs was {{not sure}} that Marcia left her home to deliver cookies to Marie Maxwell. He {{suggested}} {{she might have been}} planning to meet up with Womack. Jacobs said he thought that someone Marcia knew lured her into the garage. He did not know if it was Womack or just an [...] "adolescent teenager with his hormones blitzing." [...] "The suspect just raped someone. It was probably a new experience for him, and it was a new experience for Marcia. It was a tense situation. Marcia screamed. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> the perpetrator wanted to kill her. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to gain control of her and make her be quiet." [...] In contrast to Miller (his former boss), Jacobs did not believe that Marcia was sexually assaulted by more than one person.|$|R
5000|$|Chamberlain {{wanted to}} veer the music towards a more pop-oriented {{direction}} while Thompson opted {{to keep the}} sound experimental. As Thompson explained, [...] "there wasn't much for him to do, in a way, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> {{to say what he}} felt about the record, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> it closer in the direction of pop, because Jesse, that's always been one of his gifts, and I was determined to make the record work, and thought that it could, and should, and working with Geoff Travis, using his insights into the way music works, {{there was no other way}} it could be..." [...] The conflict of interest caused a strain on their musical partnership, although they later worked again on another record in a similar vein, Three Songs on a Trip to America, the cover of which referenced Soldier-Talk.|$|R
5000|$|More than 30 years on, TVNZ's Sunday {{programme}} {{tracked down}} the French spy who planted the bombs. Jean Camas, who {{retired from the}} DGSE in about 2000, confessed to planting both bombs on the hull of the ship. After the bombing on 10 July, Camas, using the alias Jacques Camurier, and several others posed as tourists, and took a ferry to the South Island, went skiing at Mt Hutt, and then left the country using false documents about 10 days later. Reporter John Hudson, who spent two days with Camas in France, said that Camas [...] "wanted {{an opportunity to talk}} about his role in the bombing... It has been on his conscience for 30 years. He said to us, 'secret agents don't talk', but <b>he</b> is talking. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to be understood." [...] Camas considered the mission [...] "a big, big failure".|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{believe in}} God. I'm not a {{religious}} fanatic. I can't {{remember the last time}} I went to church. My faith has carried me a long way. It's Sheilaism. Just my own little voice...It's just try to love yourself and be gentle with yourself. You know, I guess, take care of each other. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>He</b> would <b>want</b> us to take care of each other." ...|$|R
5000|$|In September 2012, Dylan {{commented on}} I'm Not There in an {{interview}} published in Rolling Stone. When journalist Mikal Gilmore asked Dylan whether he liked the film, he responded: [...] "Yeah, I {{thought it was all}} right. Do you think that the director was worried that people would understand it or not? <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> cared one bit. <b>I</b> just <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to make a good movie. I thought it looked good, and those actors were incredible." ...|$|R
5000|$|I thought <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> me to audition, and so I {{was just}} very relaxed and casual about the news. <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> to hire me, I knew that's not how things worked. The next day, they told me, you know that offer you didn't sound too excited about? It's an offer, not an audition. I flipped out. I didn't know how he was doing this! The next week I was in New Orleans.|$|R
6000|$|... "We must {{surprise}} him if we can," [...] said Curtis to Crow. [...] "We must not shoot. I {{will talk to}} him. If he cocks his gun kill him; but <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> will <b>want</b> to fight." ...|$|R
5000|$|Harrison Ford {{considers}} Deckard to be human. [...] "That was {{the main}} area of contention between Ridley and myself at the time," [...] Ford told an interviewer during a BBC One Hollywood Greats segment. [...] "I thought the audience deserved one human being on screen that they could establish an emotional relationship with. I thought I had won Ridley's agreement to that, but in fact <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> had a little reservation about that. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> really <b>wanted</b> {{to have it both}} ways." ...|$|R
