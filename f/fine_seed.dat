6000|$|This {{is a great}} joy--your {{letter of}} November 12th has just come, to my extreme delight, and I answer it, you see, within a very few hours. It {{is by far the}} best letter you have ever written me, and I am touched and {{interested}} by it more than I can say. Let me tell you at once that I sent you that last thing in type-copy because of an anxious calculation that such a form would help to secure its safe arrival. Your own scrap was a signal of the probable non-arrival of anything that seemed in the least to defy legibility; therefore I said to myself that what was flagrantly and blatantly legible would presumably reach you.... I had better make use of this chance, however, to give you an inkling of our affairs, such as they are, rather than indulge in mere surmises and desires, fond and faithful though these be, about your own eventualities. London is of course under all our stress very interesting, to me deeply and infinitely moving--but on a basis and in ways that make the life we have known here fade into grey mists of insignificance. People [...] "meet" [...] a little, but very little, every social habit and convention has broken down, save with a few vulgarians and utter mistakers (mistakers, I mean, about the decency of things;) and for myself, I confess, I find there are very few persons I care to see--only those to whom and to whose state of feeling I am really attached. Promiscuous chatter on the public situation and the gossip thereanent of more or less wailing women in particular give unspeakably on my nerves. Depths of sacred silence seem to me to prescribe themselves in presence of the sanctities of action of those who, in unthinkable conditions almost, are magnificently doing the thing. Then right and left are all the figures of mourning--though such proud erect ones--over the blow that has come to them. There the women are admirable--the mothers and wives and sisters; the mothers in particular, since it's so much the younger lives, the <b>fine</b> <b>seed</b> of the future, that are offered and taken. The rate at which they are taken is appalling--but then I think of France and Russia and even of Germany herself, and the vision simply overwhelms and breaks the heart. [...] "The German dead, the German dead!" [...] I above all say to myself--in such hecatombs have they been ruthlessly piled up by those who have driven them, from behind, to their fate; and it for the moment almost makes me forget Belgium--though when I remember that disembowelled country my heart is at once hardened to every son of a Hun. Belgium we have hugely and portentously with us; if never in the world was a nation so driven forth, so on the other hand was one never so taken to another's arms. And the Dutch have been nobly hospitable!...Immensely interesting what you say of the sublime newness of spirit of the great Russian people--of whom we are thinking here with the most confident admiration. I met a striking specimen the other day who was oddly enough in the Canadian contingent (he had been living two or three years in Canada and had volunteered there;) and who was of a stature, complexion, expression, and above all of a shining candour, which made him a kind of army-corps in himself.... But goodnight, dearest Hugh. I sit here writing late, in the now extraordinary London blackness of darkness and (almost) tension of stillness. The alarms we have had here as yet come to nothing. Please believe in the fond fidelity with which I think of you. Oh for the day of reparation and reunion! I hope for you that you may have the great and terrible experience of Ambulance service at the front. Ah how I pray you also may receive this benediction from your affectionate old ...|$|E

30|$|RUSAL Aughinish Alumina Ltd (RAAL), {{located in}} {{southern}} Ireland, is Europe’s largest alumina refinery. RAAL use the Bayer process to extract alumina from a reddish brown ore called bauxite. Initially, the bauxite is crushed and dissolved in a sodium hydroxide-water solution at 250 ∘C under pressure {{leading to the}} hydrated form of alumina, alumina trihydrate, in solution. Undesirable insoluble bauxite impurities are filtered out of the solution. After filtration, the liquor is seeded with alumina crystals to provide nucleation sites. The first stage of precipitation is known as agglomeration, and its purpose is to provide the necessary conditions to enable the cementing together of <b>fine</b> <b>seed</b> particles to produce strong agglomerates. The liquor is then cooled which leads and crystal growth in the now supersaturated solution. The time spent in this crystallisation stage accounts for up to 40 hours of the approximate total 50 hour process. The high residence time in the industrial crystallisers {{is due to the}} extremely slow crystallisation rate of (i.e., linear growth rate of 1 - 2 μm/hour). After precipitation, the alumina trihydrate is calcined at 1, 050 ^∘C to remove both the free moisture and chemically bound water. In contrast to precipitation, calcination is a much shorter process and is typically of the order of minutes. Finally, following calcination, the alumina crystals are stored in a silo for 4 - 5 days before being shipped. Crystals which do not meet the required final size are reintroduced into the precipitation stage of the process where they are used as seeds to assist future crystal growth.|$|E
40|$|Forage sorghum {{is one of}} {{the most}} heat and drought {{resistant}} cereal forage having the potential to yield nutritious forage even during the months of extreme heat for dairy animals. It yields considerably higher biomass production with less use of fertilizers and irrigations. It can be grown in almost all types of soils and has the potential to tolerate soil toxicities without considerable reduction in green forage yield. But in Pakistan, per hectare green forage yield of sorghum is much less (about 13 tons per hectare in irrigated tracts) than the potential. Rainfed areas are producing even less green forage yield than irrigated tracts. A variety of factors reduce forage sorghum yield including selection of unsuitable forage sorghum cultivars, poor seed bed preparation, weeds and fewer use of fertilizers. Appropriate agronomic management strategies hold the key in bridging the gap between forage sorghum yield and potential. Appropriate variety selection, pre-sowing seed priming and seed treatment with fungicide, <b>fine</b> <b>seed</b> bed preparation, line sowing, balanced use of fertilizers at optimum time, irrigation management, insect-pest management and harvesting at 50 % flowering stage are few of the strategies which can increase the forage sorghum yield to a great extent. Appropriate agronomic management strategies are bound to increase the forage sorghum yield as well as its quality attributes particularly protein contents. In this way, sustainable supply of green forage during summer reduces the drastic effects of forage shortage and ultimately milk production on sustainable basis can be ensured to cater the needs of rising population...|$|E
40|$|This work {{focuses on}} aspects of {{combustion}} in a spark ignition engine. A pent-roof research engine {{was used to}} generate an experimental data set which was combined with a preexisting data set from a disc-chamber research engine. The combined dataset was used to refine a thermodynamic spark ignition engine combustion code which could operate in either a three-zone entrainment and bum up, or a two-zone direct combustion, configuration. The pent-roof engine was skip-fired to ensure residual gases were purged and care was taken {{to ensure that the}} thermodynamic state and chemical composition of the intake mixture were well defined. The combustion chamber, which featured near complete optical access, was illuminated using a sheet of laser light. Mie scattered laser light from <b>fine</b> <b>seed</b> particles was recorded allowing the position of the flame front to be tracked. These images were then ensemble averaged and combined to give a three-dimensional reconstruction of the mean combustion progress variable field for three different engine speeds. As the flame approached the combustion chamber walls it was found to decelerate. A relationship between the burning velocity of an unconstrained flame and a flame approaching a wall was derived which agreed well with the experimental results. This relationship was incorporated into the engine simulation code and found to improve greatly the predictions of the two-zone combustion model. New flame acceleration and laminar burning velocity submodels reported in the literature were added to the engine simulation code. The suitability of these models for simulating spark ignition engine combustion was evaluated using the disc and pent roof experimental data sets and model constants adjusted to optimise the performance of each submodel. Although there were substantial differences between the individual submodels, over the range of operating conditions for which experimental data was available changes to the submodel used had a negligible effect on the combustion model predictions. The work concludes with an evaluation of the performance of the three-zone combustion model for simulating a pent-roof engine. The model was modified for the pent-roof engine to include suitable assumptions for turbulence and the position of the centre of the flame. Using constants which were chosen to fit data recorded in the disc chamber engine, the model predictions for the pentroof engine were comparable in accuracy to predictions for the disc roof engine. The model was incorporated in a commercially available manifold gas dynamics simulation software to allow the predictive simulation of complete engine cycles.

40|$|A {{swirling}} {{fluidized bed}} (SFB) {{is known to}} yield high a solid-fluid interaction which augments heat and mass transfer due to the swirling motion. Its distributor is known as annular blade distributor as it is constructed from blades that are truncated sectors and has an annular geometry. The annular blade distributor provides lateral momentum which is ideal for various industrial applications. However, the distributor is limited to shallow bed operation only due to momentum attenuation in the vertical direction. This limits the full potential of the bed. The present study attempts to remove this limitation by introducing the annular blade distributor with radial inclination. Qualitative flow assessment via flow visualization technique is reported {{on the effect of}} using such distributor blades. <b>Fine</b> <b>seeding</b> particles were injected upstream of the system to observe difference in using the annular distributor (0 ˚ inclination) and radially inclined distributor (13. 5 ˚ inclination). The distributor pressure drop was also measured to quantify the energy loss associated with both distributors. The findings show that radial inclination of distributor blades in a SFB is capable in reducing the net centrifugal force generated inside the bed due to the intense swirling motion. As a result, the steep variation of momentum distribution in the bed is reduced, although a slight increase in the distributor pressure drop was noticed...|$|R
50|$|Around {{the end of}} August a rosette {{of leaves}} appears, which winters and dies back in July at the latest. During the {{following}} weeks, a flower stalk emerges from {{the centre of the}} dead leaf rosette, and during flowering, one or two new rosettes are formed. Autumn lady's tresses blossoms after the summer (August-October). The species is not self-pollinating. The pollination is done by bees and bumblebees. In nature, less than the half of the fruit capsules produce <b>seeds.</b> The very <b>fine</b> <b>seeds</b> are dispersed by the wind in October or November. Nevertheless, most seeds will not disperse more than a few dm from the mother plant since the vast majority of new plants are in close vicinity to an adult plant. Autumn lady's tresses spreads primarily through sexual reproduction. However, the plants to a limited extent also propagate vegetatively by the formation of side buds on the underground stem. The new plant forms its own tuber and leaf rosette, and if the old root dies, the connection between the two daughter plants is broken. The plants therefore often occur in small dense groups. An individual plant does not usually flower every year, apparently because the production of seeds takes a lot of effort. Plants do not necessarily appear above ground each year, so that after an absence mature plants suddenly seem to appear out of nowhere.|$|R
6000|$|By an {{elaborate}} {{series of experiments}} carried on for many years Mr. Darwin demonstrated the great value of cross-fertilisation in increasing the rapidity of growth, the strength and vigour of the plant, and in adding to its fertility. This effect is produced immediately, not as he expected would be the case, after several generations of crosses. He planted seeds from cross-fertilised and self-fertilised plants on {{two sides of the}} same pot exposed to exactly similar conditions, and in most cases the difference in size and vigour was amazing, while the plants from cross-fertilised parents also produced more and <b>finer</b> <b>seeds.</b> These experiments entirely confirmed the experience of breeders of animals already referred to (p. 160), and led him to enunciate his famous aphorism, [...] "Nature abhors perpetual self-fertilisation".[144] In this principle we appear to have a sufficient reason for the various contrivances by which so many flowers secure cross-fertilisation, either constantly or occasionally. These contrivances are so numerous, so varied, and often so highly complex and extraordinary, that they have formed the subject of many elaborate treatises, and have also been amply popularised in lectures and handbooks. It will be unnecessary, therefore, to give details here, but the main facts will be summarised in order to call attention to some difficulties of the theory which seem to require further elucidation.|$|R
60|$|Four long-styled great-grandchildren {{were raised}} from the self-fertilised grandchildren, and were kept {{under the same}} highly {{favourable}} conditions in the greenhouse; 10 of their flowers were fertilised with own-form pollen and yielded the large proportion of 6 capsules, containing on an average 18.7 seeds. From these seeds 20 long-styled great-great-grandchildren were raised, which were likewise kept in the greenhouse. Thirty of their flowers were fertilised with their own pollen and yielded 17 capsules, containing on an average no less than 32, mostly <b>fine</b> <b>seeds.</b> It appears, therefore, that the fertility of these plants of the fourth illegitimate generation, {{as long as they}} were kept under highly favourable conditions, had not decreased, but had rather increased. The result, however, was widely different when they were planted out of doors in good soil, where other cowslips grew vigorously and were completely fertile; for these illegitimate plants now became much dwarfed in stature and extremely sterile, notwithstanding that they were exposed to the visits of insects, and must have been legitimately fertilised by the surrounding legitimate plants. A whole row of these plants of the fourth illegitimate generation, thus freely exposed and legitimately fertilised, produced only 3 capsules, containing on an average only 17 seeds. During the ensuing winter almost all these plants died, and the few survivors were miserably unhealthy, whilst the surrounding legitimate plants were not in the least injured.|$|R

60|$|It {{has been}} said {{in the case of}} this plant, as of so many others, that the flowers are fertilised in the bud, and that {{distinct}} plants or varieties can never naturally intercross. (4/8. Decaisne 'Comptes-Rendus' July 1863 page 5.) But this is an error, as we may infer, firstly from the flowers being proterandrous,--the mature stamens bending up, one after the other, into the passage which leads to the nectary, and afterwards the mature pistils bending in the same direction; secondly, from the number of humble-bees which visit the flowers (4/9. Their structure is described by H. Muller 'Befruchtung' etc., page 122.); and thirdly, from the greater fertility of the flowers when crossed with pollen from a distinct plant than when spontaneously self-fertilised. In the year 1863 I enclosed a large branch in a net, and crossed five flowers with pollen from a distinct plant; these yielded capsules containing on an average 35.2 very <b>fine</b> <b>seeds,</b> with a maximum of forty-two in one capsule. Thirty-two other flowers on the same branch produced twenty-eight spontaneously self-fertilised capsules, containing on an average 17.2 seeds, with a maximum in one of thirty-six seeds. But six of these capsules were very poor, yielding only from one to five seeds; if these are excluded, the remaining twenty-two capsules give an average of 20.9 seeds, though many of these seeds were small. The fairest ratio, therefore, for the number of seeds produced by a cross and by spontaneous self-fertilisation is as 100 to 59. These seeds were not sown, as I had too many other experiments in progress.|$|R
