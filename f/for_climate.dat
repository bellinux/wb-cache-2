40|$|This {{chapter is}} {{designed}} to test which of the competing perspectives, ‘work satisfaction as intermediary’ or ‘work satisfaction as outcome’, is more appropriate to describe the role of work satisfaction {{in the relationship between}} <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> efficiency, <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> service and productivity in business units. Longitudinal data obtained from more than 14, 000 employees in 171 branches of a financial services organization provided no evidence for the ‘work satisfaction as intermediary’ perspective. Work satisfaction is not related to productivity in this study. In line with a ‘work satisfaction as outcome’ perspective, <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> efficiency is more associated with productivity than <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> service, and <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> service is more associated with work satisfaction than <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> efficiency. Across time a trade-off was found: <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> service at time point 1 is negatively related to productivity at time point 2, and <b>climate</b> <b>for</b> efficiency at time point 1 is negatively related to work satisfaction at time point 2. These findings highlight the need to study the differential effects of strategic climate types on work satisfaction and productivity...|$|R

5|$|The book {{presents}} an in-depth analysis and refutation {{of climate change}} denial, going over several arguments point-by-point and disproving them with peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus <b>for</b> <b>climate</b> change. The authors assert that those denying climate change engage in tactics including cherry picking data purported to support their specific viewpoints, and attacking the integrity of climate scientists. They use social science theory to examine the phenomenon of climate change denial in the wider public, and call this phenomenon a form of pathology.|$|E

5|$|Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand {{presents}} {{a detailed analysis}} and refutation of climate change denial. In her foreword to the book, Naomi Oreskes writes that people fall victim to the phenomenon of denial due to feeling frightened. The book examines several arguments against global warming, and uses peer-reviewed evidence from the scientific consensus to back-up rationale for disputing the validity of each argument. The methodology of those denying climate change is assessed, including: cherry picking data purporting to support their specific viewpoints, maintaining a high bar for evidence of climate change by those denying it, and criticism {{of the values of}} climate scientists themselves. The book puts forth an explanation why certain individuals, and the wider public, have a tendency to deny the scientific consensus <b>for</b> <b>climate</b> change.|$|E
5|$|Cook's {{education}} {{includes a}} background in physics. Prior to {{his work on the}} book, Cook founded the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of climate change.

After the publication of Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another book on the subject, Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical Climate (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland.|$|E

5|$|Interactions {{between the}} two {{theories}} <b>for</b> <b>climate</b> modification have also been studied, as global warming and global dimming are neither mutually exclusive nor contradictory. In a paper published on March 8, 2005 in the American Geophysical Union's Geophysical Research Letters, a research team led by Anastasia Romanou of Columbia University's Department of Applied Physics and Mathematics, New York, also showed that the apparently opposing forces of global warming and global dimming can occur at the same time. Global dimming interacts with global warming by blocking sunlight that would otherwise cause evaporation and the particulates bind to water droplets. Water vapor is the major greenhouse gas. On the other hand, global dimming is affected by evaporation and rain. Rain {{has the effect of}} clearing out polluted skies.|$|E

She helped to put climate change, acid rain and general pollution in the British mainstream in the late 1980s, and in 1989 she called for a global treaty on climate change. Her speeches included one to the Royal Society on 27 September 1988 and to the UN General Assembly in November 1989. However, following her retirement as Prime Minister in 1990, she became sceptical about climate change policy and rejected climate alarmism.|$|E
5|$|The book traces {{financial}} support <b>for</b> <b>climate</b> change denial to the fossil fuel industry, asserting {{these companies have}} attempted to influence public opinion on the matter.

The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E
