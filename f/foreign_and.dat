5|$|A {{simplified}} {{version of}} the model was popularized by Paul Krugman in the 1990s in his book Peddling Prosperity. In this set up there are two firms, one <b>foreign</b> <b>and</b> one domestic which are considering entering a new export market in a third country (or possibly the whole world). The demand in the export market is such that if only one firm enters, {{it will make a}} profit, but if they both enter each will make a loss, perhaps because of initial set up, infrastructure, product development, marketing or other fixed costs of entry. The matrix below presents a stylized example of the game that the two firms are engaged in.|$|E
