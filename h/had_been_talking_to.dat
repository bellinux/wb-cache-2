5|$|Sources {{indicate}} that executive producer Steve Jobs lacked {{confidence in the}} film during its production, and he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> various companies, ranging from Hallmark to Microsoft, about selling Pixar. However, as the film progressed, Jobs became ever more excited about it, feeling {{that he might be}} on the verge of transforming the movie industry. As scenes from the movie were finished, he watched them repeatedly and had friends come by his home to share his new passion. Jobs decided that the release of Toy Story that November would be the occasion to take Pixar public. A test audience near Anaheim in late July 1995 indicated the need for last-minute tweaks, which added further pressure to the already frenetic final weeks. Response cards from the audience were encouraging, but were not top of the scale, adding further question as to how audiences would respond. The film ended with a shot of Andy's house and the sound of a new puppy. Michael Eisner, who attended the screening, told Lasseter afterward that the film needed to end with a shot of Woody and Buzz together, reacting to the news of the puppy.|$|E

NS is upgrading 3,800 of its locomotives with new technology that is 73 percent more efficient than previous models. The new technology being put into the locomotives is making the ride more fuel efficient and reducing idle time.|$|E
25|$|The latter {{incident}} proved counter-productive to the Argentine sovereignty push, as Lord Chalfont <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> {{a public}} {{meeting at the}} time of the plane's arrival. The islanders made it plain to Lord Chalfont that they rejected a Memorandum of Agreement negotiated between Britain and Argentina that August which stated that Britain was prepared to discuss sovereignty provided the islanders' wishes were respected. This spurred the formation of the Falkland Islands Committee by London barrister Bill Hunter-Christie and others. The Emergency Committee, as it became known, proved to be an effective lobbying organisation, constantly undermining Foreign Office initiatives on sovereignty negotiations. In December 1968, the lobbying effort managed to force the British Government to state that the islanders' wishes would be paramount.|$|E

He did so after he logged his 97th career triple-double in a 115–99 loss to the Charlotte Bobcats. Kidd was voted by the fans to start in the 2008 All-Star game in New Orleans as a guard along with Dwyane Wade. During that season Kidd had been mentioned in trade rumors, notably to the Los Angeles Lakers, but the deal fell through when the Lakers {{refused to give up}} their young center Andrew Bynum. On January 28, 2008, Kidd revealed that his agent <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> the Nets' front office about a trade. On February 19, 2008, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks, the team that originally drafted him.|$|E
500|$|Mersey Beat founder Bill Harry later repudiated {{the story}} about Epstein not knowing who the Beatles were, as Harry <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Epstein about the band {{for a long time}} (being the group he {{promoted}} the most in Mersey Beat) and by McCartney saying, “Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were, they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat.” Regardless, the interest in the record eventually led Epstein to make his way to the Cavern with Taylor, during lunch hour on 9 November 1961. He was initially repelled by the dark, damp club, but he congratulated them on their performance.|$|E

Maple believed that the legacy created within these communities {{was a combination of}} both fact and myth, with [...] "Murrell the man" [...] being supplanted by [...] "Murrell the myth", around which a [...] "vast wealth of lore" [...] accrued. Maple noted that many of the attributes associated with witches in British folklore came {{to be associated with the}} cunning man. For instance, he highlighted the existence of local stories that credited Murrell with the ability to fly, and that he was once observed flying over the River Crouch on a broomstick. Another story held that Murrell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> a group of old men in Canvey Island before suddenly vanishing and reappearing in his own village, which was several miles away.|$|E

500|$|Epstein saw {{numerous}} posters around Liverpool advertising concerts by the Beatles {{as well as}} in {{the second}} issue of Mersey Beat, which had [...] "Beatles sign Recording Contract!" [...] on the front cover, as the Beatles had recorded the [...] "My Bonnie" [...] single with Tony Sheridan in Germany. Some months after its release, Epstein supposedly (as stated in his biography), asked his assistant Alistair Taylor about the single, because a customer, one Raymond Jones, had asked Epstein for the single on 28 October 1961, which made Epstein curious about the group. Harry and McCartney repudiated this story, as Harry <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Epstein about the Beatles for a long time (being the group he promoted the most in Mersey Beat), and by McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were, they were on the front page of the second issue of Mersey Beat." ...|$|E

Taylor later claimed that he had used the name of Jones (a regular customer) to order the single and paid the deposit, knowing that Epstein would notice it and order further copies. Harry and McCartney later repudiated Epstein's story, as Harry <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Epstein for a long time about the Beatles—the group that he promoted the most in Mersey Beat—with McCartney saying, [...] "Brian [...] knew perfectly well who the Beatles were; they were {{on the front page of}} the second issue of Mersey Beat".

After {{he learned that}} Trump was about to fire Comey, Rosenstein submitted to Trump a memo critical of Comey's conduct in the investigation about Hillary Clinton's emails. Trump <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> aides about firing Comey {{for at least a}} week before acting, and had asked Justice Department officials {{to come up with a}} rationale for dismissing him.

2500|$|Guth {{decided to}} solve this problem by {{suggesting}} a supercooling during a delayed phase transition. This seemed very promising for solving the magnetic monopole problem. By the time they came up with that, Guth had gone to the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) for a year, but Guth <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Henry Tye back and forth. Tye suggested that they check that {{the expansion of the universe}} would not be affected by the supercooling. In the supercooled state, a false vacuum is produced. The false vacuum is a vacuum in the sense that it is state of the lowest possible density of energy; it is false in the sense that it is not a permanent state of being. False vacuums decay, and Guth was to find that the decay of the false vacuum at the beginning of the universe would produce amazing results, namely the exponential expansion of space. [...] This solved the monopole problem, since the expansion dilutes the monopole density.|$|E
2500|$|Bree is delighted, but {{insists on}} concocting {{a reason for}} Andrew's long absence. Returning to normal social activities, he is disconcerted {{to see one of}} his former clients at a school science fair. Orson is worried for Andrew, which Bree notices and asks him about later that night. Wanting no secrets, Orson confesses that Andrew sold himself for money, and that the man he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> was a {{previous}} client. Bree, shocked, and a friend of the man's wife, confesses all to her. She takes it badly, and tells Bree in return that Danielle is sleeping with her history teacher. Later, Andrew watches the tail end of her argument with Danielle and, concerned, he tries to comfort Bree, explaining that she did instill moral values, [...] "I mean, we know {{the difference between right and}} wrong, we just chose wrong", but also that she pushed them so hard they had to rebel. Bree tries to subtly get him to talk about his prostitution, but he gently brushes her off. Andrew has since got a job working at Tom's pizzeria, though he takes a fairly lax attitude to his work.|$|E
2500|$|Relationship of Command was {{recorded}} over a seven-week period starting on January 17, 2000, following a tour supporting Rage Against the Machine. The album {{was recorded}} at the Indigo Ranch Studios, in Malibu, California, and {{was produced by}} Ross Robinson and mixed by Andy Wallace. Known for his unorthodox production methods, Robinson at one point took bass player Paul Hinojos for a drive in his SUV through the hills of Malibu to get his adrenaline going prior to recording. He also brought Iggy Pop to the studio for a guest appearance; Omar Rodriguez commented: [...] " [...] <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Iggy because they were gonna work together.

2500|$|However, on 23 February 1974, {{with the}} {{election}} only five days away, Powell dramatically {{turned his back on}} his Party, giving as the reasons that it had taken the United Kingdom into the EEC without having a mandate to do so, and that it had abandoned other manifesto commitments, so that he could no longer support it at the election. The monetarist economist Milton Friedman sent Powell a letter praising him as principled. Powell had arranged for his friend Andrew Alexander to talk to Joe Haines, the press secretary of the Labour leader Harold Wilson, about the timing of Powell's speeches against Heath. Powell <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> Wilson irregularly since June 1973 during chance meetings in the gentlemen's lavatories of the [...] "aye" [...] lobby in the House of Commons. Wilson and Haines had ensured that Powell would dominate the newspapers of the Sunday and Monday before election day by having no Labour frontbencher give a major speech on 23 February, the day of Powell's speech. Powell gave this speech at the Mecca Dance Hall in the Bull Ring, Birmingham, to an audience of 1,500, with some press reports estimating that 7,000 more had to be turned away. Powell said the issue of British membership of the EEC was one where [...] "if there be a conflict between the call of country and that of party, the call of country must come first": ...|$|E
