25|$|While pheromones {{explain the}} pharaoh ant's {{remarkable}} foraging ability, each forager’s uncanny capability {{to find its}} {{way back to the}} nest requires a different explanation. In fact, the pharaoh ant relies on geometry to show it the way home. Each fork in the trail system spreads at an angle between 50 and 60 degrees. When returning to the nest, a forager that encounters a fork will almost always take the path that deviates less from its current direction. In other words, it will never choose an acute angle that would drastically change its direction. Using this algorithm, each forager is able to find its way back to the nest. If the <b>fork</b> <b>angle</b> is experimentally increased to an angle between 60 and 120 degrees, M. pharaonis foragers were significantly less able to find their nest. This method of decision-making reduces the wasted energy that would result from traveling in the wrong direction and contributes to the pharaoh ant's efficiency in foraging.|$|E

The reason for this is to give the captives stimuli; it also keeps their feet healthy, and nimble. Research (suitability, and toxicity) must be carried out on all plant material going into any cages. Cherry wood is poisonous, as is broom, kowhai, and avocado (its fruit being surprisingly poisonous to parrots), to mention just a few examples.|$|R

40|$|High-quality BaTiO 3 {{epitaxial}} {{thin films}} on MgO substrates have been grown by pulsed-laser deposition. Both, c-axis and a-axis BaTiO 3 orientations were studied. Mach-Zehnder optical waveguide modulators with a <b>fork</b> <b>angle</b> of 1. 7 degrees have been fabricated by ion-beam etching. The waveguides {{are of the}} ridge type, the BaTiO 3 thickness is 1 mum, the ridge step 50 nm, and the width 2 mum. Light was coupled into the waveguides from optical fibers. The BaTiO 3 waveguide propagation losses are 2 - 3 dB/cm. Electrodes of 3 mm length were deposited besides the waveguides. Electro-optic modulation has been demonstrated with V-pi= 6. 3 V at 632 nm wavelength and V-pi= 9. 5 V at 1550 nm wavelength for the a-axis samples, and with V-pi= 8 V at 632 nm wavelength and V-pi= 15 V at 1550 nm for the c-axis samples. Theoretical modelling of the Mach-Zehnder modulators for both crystalline orientations of the BaTiO 3 films gave the Pockels coefficients r(51) = 80 pm/V for the c-axis film and an effective Pockels coefficient r(eff) = 734 pm/V for the a-axis films at 632 nm wavelength.

40|$|Detailed {{calculations}} of light relations and seasonal potential photosynthesis {{are carried out}} for models of leaf canopies of closed trellis orchard design, with the object of comparing the effectiveness of light capture and usage in canopies of various fork angles and various values of leaf area index. It is assumed that all canopies have adequate water, carbon dioxide and nutrients, a condition satisfied in practical orchards. After examination of a very simple model, a detailed model is set up to take full account of direct sunlight, diffuse skylight and light scattered diffusely by foliage. Irradiance at leaf surfaces of various orientations is calculated from first principles, since in a canopy whose geometry is not independent of azimuth there is no straightforward way of assessing diffuse irradiance. An analytical expression is derived for rate of photosynthesis averaged over sunlit leaves randomly oriented in azimuth at any given isotropic diffuse irradiance. The calculated field of photosynthetically active radiation is used to estimate canopy net photosynthesis during the fruit-filling season for peach orchards. In such canopies the foliage-scattered diffuse light is found to make a relatively small contribution (about 10 percent) to net canopy photosynthesis. It is found that for any given value of leaf area index the seasonal potential photosynthesis, whether net or gross, increases as canopy <b>fork</b> <b>angle</b> increases, {{in the range of}} angles from 40 degrees to 180 degrees. The estimated absolute harvest yield of peaches in a 60 degree canopy is found to be lower than the mean value of published measured yields by about one standard deviation. Reasons for this are discussed. The low estimated yield does not affect the validity of theoretical comparison between the various canopies. One of several possible causes of an underestimate of potential photosynthesis is neglect of penumbral effects. A theoretical framework is developed for estimation of the error introduced in photosynthesis calculations by the assumption that incident direct solar radiation is a perfectly parallel beam of light. The {{calculations of}} Miller and Norman (1971) on distribution of direct sunlight flux density along transects in sunflecks are discussed. The present theory is developed in terms of probabilities of irradiation by full sun and by partially shaded sun and the probability of umbra at any level in a leaf canopy. Analytical expressions are derived for probability density with respect to fraction of the full sun radiant flux density for partial shading by a straight edge, a circular disk, and a thin strip. It is shown that solar limb darkening may be neglected for the present purpose. The geometry of umbra and penumbra due to crossed shading edges is discussed and quantified. The developed theory is applied to hypothetical canopies of randomly dispersed horizontal circular leaves and to randomly oriented and dispersed vertical leaves. A parameter called the characteristic leaf area index is introduced; this parameter, which includes foliage density and leaf dimensions, may be used in assessing the error in estimated canopy photosynthesis due to neglect of penumbra. Application of the theory to the effects of vertical distribution of foliage on canopy photosynthesis is briefly discussed. The underestimate of potential canopy photosynthesis in a peach tree canopy due to neglect of penumbra is found to be of order 5 percent.

40|$|Owing to {{noticeable}} differences {{of the characters}} between the electrical and the conventional gasoline-powered motorcycles, such as heavier in weight, lower in mass center position and slower in forward speed, the control and design considerations of the electrical motorcycles {{are not the same}} as conventional motorcycles. In this paper, the rider upper body lean control system is considered as the only control action to analyze and simulate the stability and the perception of riding comfort of the rider-motorcycle system in different riding conditions and parameter designs. The equations of lateral motion of an electrical motorcycle, which includes the rider upper body leaning motion, are derived first from Newton mechanics. Via this dynamics model and its associated transfer functions at various speeds, perception of riding comfort is defined as the damping ratio of frequency domain Bode plots in classical control theory. By the analysis, we find that the tendency of the stability is the same under the straight-line and the cornering motions, but shows significant differences for different parameter designs of the electrical motorcycle. We discuss the effect on the perception of riding comfort issue for changing mass center position, total weight of the motorcycle, the wheelbase, the front <b>fork</b> rake <b>angle</b> and the front wheel trail distance of the motorcycle. On the premise of the stability, we use the maximum damping ratio to represent the riding response of the motorcycle to find the best perception of riding comfort. By the analysis results, if we move the mass center forward, shorten the wheelbase, steepen the front <b>fork</b> rake <b>angle</b> and shorten the front wheel trail distance of the current design of electrical motorcycles in the market, a better perception of riding comfort is achieved. From the user's point of view, our analysis method of perception of riding comfort can be a supplement to the analysis of the stability of motorcycles...|$|R
50|$|The fruits are a samara {{with the}} nutlet {{at the base}} and a wing {{extending}} up from the nutlet. The elliptical nutlet ranges between 0.6 - 1.2 cm in length, with a 0.4 - 0.7 cm long attachment scar along the wing base. Eight to twelve veins spread from the attachment scar across the nutlet and then converge at the nut tip. Six to eight veins extend into the wing, running along the proximal edge and the forking veins running from the vascular group <b>fork</b> at <b>angles</b> between 10° and 30°. The wings are between 2.2 and 3.5 cm long with a straight upper margin that broadly curves towards the wing apex, and the distal margin forming a wide v-shaped sulcus. Chaney & Axelrod suggested the fruits belonged to a Acer section Saccharina species, but Wolfe and Tanai note the lack of reticulated venation on the nutlet excludes that placement, and placed the fruits into Acer section Rubra. Many of the fruits show irregular folds on the nutlet, that Wolfe and Tanai suggested {{were the result of}} a thin endocarp.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{report a}} new family of ultra-high Q silicon MEMS tuning <b>fork</b> {{gyroscopes}} demonstrating <b>angle</b> rate and, for the first time, rate integrating (whole angle) operation. The novel mechanical architecture eliminates low frequency in-phase modes and maximizes the Q-factors. A vacuum packaged SOI dual mass gyroscope with a 1. 7 kHz operational frequency demonstrated drive- and sense- mode Q-factors of 0. 31 and 0. 64 million, respectively. A completely symmetric, dynamically balanced quadruple mass gyroscope with a 2. 2 kHz operational frequency demonstrated identical drive- and sense-mode Q-factors of 0. 45 million. Due to the stiffness and damping symmetry, the new gyroscope can be instrumented to measure the angle of rotation directly, eliminating the bandwidth and dynamic range limitations of conventional MEMS vibratory rate gyroscopes. The technology may enable silicon micromachined devices for inertial guidance applications previously limited to precision-machined quartz hemispherical resonator gyroscopes. I...|$|R
