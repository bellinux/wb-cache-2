Actual fools often lacks the ability to behave according to the norms, while conscious jesters exaggerated to serve as a mirror to their public. The image of the jester is mainly shaped by its heyday. This ran from the Middle Ages to the late seventeenth century. The default image is that of the jester with fool's cap with bells, cheerful colors and oversized shoes, and marotte. In reality, some wore a jester costume, but other wore deliberately shabby clothes and some wore noble robes. Nowadays we imagine the jester often with a small deformed appearance, but this was not always the case.|$|E

40|$|Nuclear pore {{complexes}} (NPCs) {{span the}} 2 membranes {{of the nuclear}} envelope (NE) and facilitate nucleocytoplasmic exchange of macromolecules. NPCs have a roughly tripartite structural organization with the so-called nuclear basket emanating from the NPC scaffold into the nucleoplasm. The nuclear basket is composed of the 3 nucleoporins Nup 153, Nup 50, and Tpr, but their specific role for the structural organization of this NPC substructure is, however, not well established. In this study, we have used thin-section transmission electron microscopy to determine the structural consequences of altering the expression of Nup 153 in human cells. We show that the assembly and integrity of the nuclear basket is not affected by Nup 153 depletion, whereas its integrity is perturbed in cells expressing high concentrations of the zinc-finger domain of Nup 153. Moreover, even mild over-expression of Nup 153 <b>is</b> <b>coinciding</b> <b>with</b> massive changes in nuclear organization {{and it is the}} excess of the zinc-finger domain of Nup 153 that is sufficient to induce these rearrangements.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Our current {{understanding}} of the structure and dynamics of the Virgo cluster is reviewed. Special emphasis is given to a possible connection between the activity of M 87 and the cluster as a whole. The Virgo cluster is an aggregate {{of at least three}} separate subclusters, centered on M 87, M 86, and M 49. The dominant M 87 subclump, with a mass of a few 1014 M, is outweighing the other two subclumps by an order of magnitude. There is evidence, from the kinematics of dwarf galaxies and the structure of the X-ray gas, that the M 86 subclump is falling into the M 87 subclump from the back with a relative velocity of 1500 km s- 1. M 87 and M 86 seem to be embedded in a common, cocoon-like swarm of dwarf ellipticals. The orientation of this cocoon, or simply the line connecting M 87 and M 86, <b>is</b> <b>coinciding</b> <b>with</b> the (projected) direction of the jet of M 87.

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} by Ibata et al. (2013) {{of a vast}} thin disk of satellites (VTDS) around M 31 {{offers a}} new challenge for {{the understanding of the}} Local Group properties. This comes in addition to the unexpected proximity of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) to the Milky Way (MW), and to another vast polar structure (VPOS), which is almost perpendicular to our Galaxy disk. We find that the VTDS plane <b>is</b> <b>coinciding</b> <b>with</b> several stellar, tidally-induced streams in the outskirts of M 31, and, that its velocity distribution is consistent with that of the Giant Stream (GS). This is suggestive of a common physical mechanism, likely linked to merger tidal interactions, knowing that a similar argument may apply to the VPOS at the MW location. Furthermore, the VTDS is pointing towards the MW, being almost perpendicular to the MW disk, as the VPOS is. We compare these properties to the modelling of M 31 as an ancient, gas-rich major merger, which has been successfully used to predict the M 31 substructures and the GS origin. We find that without fine tuning, the induced tidal tails are lying in the VTD...|$|E

Since {{the involvement of}} enzymes in gut functional maturation was overlooked, the present study aimed to investigate the role of enzymes in gut functional maturation using neonatal rats. Methods Suckling rats (Rattus norvegicus) were instagastrically gavaged with porcine pancreatic en-zymes (Creon), microbial-derived amylase, protease, lipase and mixture thereof, while con-trols received α-lactalbumin or water once per day during 14 – 16 d of age. At 17 d of age the animals were euthanized and visceral organs were dissected, weighed and analyzed for structural and functional properties. For some of the rats, gavage with the macromolecular markers such as bovine serum albumin and bovine IgG was performed 3 hours prior to blood collection to assess the intestinal permeability. Results Gavage with the pancreatic or pancreatic-like enzymes resulted in stimulated gut growth, in-creased gastric acid secretion and switched intestinal disaccharidases, with decreased lac-tase and increased maltase and sucrase activities. The fetal-type vacuolated enterocytes were replaced by the adult-type in the distal intestine, and macromolecular transfer to the blood was declined. Enzyme exposure also promoted pancreas growth with increased amy-lase and trypsin production. These effects were confined to the proteases in a dose-dependent manner...|$|E

These conditions predict disability and poor self-rated health and often are {{more prevalent in}} women than men. Thus, gender gaps in obesity and other chronic conditions may account for older women's greater disability and worse self-rated health in poor, rural populations, where aging, obesity, and chronic conditions are rapidly emerging. In a survey of 604 adults 50 years and older in rural Guatemala, we assessed whether gender gaps in obesity and other chronic conditions accounted for gender gaps in disability and self-rated health. Obesity strongly predicted gross mobility (GM) disability, {{and the number of}} chronic conditions strongly predicted all outcomes, especially in women. Controlling for gender gaps in body-mass index (BMI) and especially the number of chronic conditions eliminated gender gaps in GM disability, and controlling for gender gaps in the number of chronic conditions eliminated gender gaps in self-rated health. We recommend conducting longitudinal cohort studies to explore interventions that may mitigate adult obesity and chronic conditions among poor, rural older adults. Such interventions also may reduce gender gaps in later-life disability and self-rated health.

Such a conceptually simple model thus allows to quantify {{what had been}} repeatedly observed in post-seismic investigations: Having a fundamental frequency close to that of soil leads to increased damage. Conversely, if the building frequency {{is lower than the}} soil frequency, the building does not “feel” the effect of the site resonance, and the damage level is comparable on soil and rock: This was observed for instance in Mexico City in 1985 for very high-rise buildings with frequencies much below 0.5  Hz. This result might, however, be modified for multi-degree-of-freedom oscillators if some overtone <b>is</b> <b>coinciding</b> <b>with</b> site frequency. A second observation is related to the impact of velocity contrast: The stronger the site amplification, the larger the damage increment Δ(DI). It is finally worth noticing the damage increment is found to be rather low for low PGA levels, then to increase significantly for moderate PGA levels (~ 0.2 – 0.4  g) and then to saturate or even decrease for very large PGA levels. This is related to: (1) the nonlinear behavior in the structure activated only beyond some threshold pga value, (2) the definition of the damage index, with very low values as long as the structure remains elastic and (3) the significant damage on rock for very strong motion.|$|E

This is usually assessed {{by measuring the}} crea-tinine clearance, but because of its limitations, {{it is not an}} ideal marker for assessing the renal function. Serum Cystatin C (sCyC) appears to be an endogenous marker of glomerular filtration rate (GFR). To assess the use of sCyC as a marker of renal function in kidney transplant patients, we compared it with serum creatinine (sCr) and 24 -hour urine creatinine clearance (CrCl) in the first week post-transplantation. Among 60 patients (62. 8 &#x 0025; men, 37. 2 &#x 0025; women) undergoing kidney transplantation (average age: 44. 87 &# 177; 13. 37 years), we determined renal function at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days after kidney transplantation using: sCr, sCyC and CrCl in a 24 -hours urine specimen. During the first 5 days following transplantation, there was a progressive decline in sCr levels. In the first 5 days, post transplantation we could not find good correlation between CrC and sCyC, and the sCyC increased during these 5 days, but after that in day 7, there was a good correlation between CrC and sCyC which <b>is</b> <b>coinciding</b> <b>with</b> decreasing the dose of steroid (r=. 625).
