In each case {{he knew how to}} apply stylistic particularities, personalising the decoration according to the owner's taste, the predominant style of the arrangement or its place in the surroundings—whether urban or natural, secular or religious. Many of his works were related to liturgical <b>furnishing.</b> From the design of a desk for his office {{at the beginning of his}} career to the furnishings designed for the Sobrellano Palace of Comillas, he designed all <b>furnishing</b> of the Vicens, Calvet, Batlló and Milà houses, of the Güell Palace and the Bellesguard Tower, and the liturgical <b>furnishing</b> of the Sagrada Família. It is noteworthy that Gaudí studied some ergonomy in order to adapt his furnishings to human anatomy. Many of his furnishings are exhibited at Gaudi House Museum.|$|E

50|$|As {{alternatives}} to battery cages, Directive 1999/74/EC allows non-cage systems and <b>furnished</b> cages. <b>Furnished</b> cages therefore represent a feasible alternative to battery cages in the EU after 2012.

Austria banned battery cages in 2009 and is set to ban <b>furnished</b> cages by 2020. Belgium has also banned the battery cage - and proposes to ban <b>furnished</b> cages by 2024.

40|$|In the European Union, {{conventional}} cages for {{laying hens}} will be faded {{out at the}} beginning of 2012. The rationale behind this is a public concern over animal welfare in egg production. As alternatives to conventional cages, the European Union Council Directive 1999 / 74 / EC allows non-cage systems and enriched (<b>furnished)</b> cages. Layer performance, behavior, and welfare in differently sized <b>furnished</b> cages have been investigated quite widely during recent decades, but nutrition of hens in this production system has received less attention. This thesis aims to compare production and feed intake of laying hens in <b>furnished</b> and conventional cages and to study the effects of different dietary treatments in these production systems, thus contributing to the general knowledge of <b>furnished</b> cages as an egg production system. A <b>furnished</b> cage model for 8 hens was compared with a 3 -hen conventional cage. Three consecutive experiments each studied one aspect of layer diet: The first experiment investigated the effects of dietary protein/energy ratio, the second dietary energy levels, and the third the effects of extra limestone supplementation. In addition, a fourth experiment evaluated the effects of perches on feed consumption and behavior of hens in <b>furnished</b> cages. The dietary treatments in experiments 1 – 3 generally had similar effects in the two cage types. Thus, there was no evidence supporting a change in nutrient requirements for laying hens when conventional cages are replaced with small-group <b>furnished</b> cages. Moreover, the results from nutritional experiments conducted in conventional cages can be applied to smallgroup <b>furnished</b> cage systems. These results support the view that production performance comparable with conventional cages can be achieved in <b>furnished</b> cages. All of the advantages of cages for bird welfare are sustained in the smallgroup <b>furnished</b> cages used here. In addition, frequent use of perches and nests implies a wider behavioral repertoire in <b>furnished</b> cages than in conventional cages. The increase observed in bone ash content may improve bird welfare in <b>furnished</b> cages. The presence of perches diminished feed consumption during the prelaying period and enhanced the feed conversion ratio during the early laying period in <b>furnished</b> cages. However, as {{the presence or absence of}} perches in <b>furnished</b> cages had no significant effect on feed consumption after the prelaying period, the lower feed consumption observed in <b>furnished</b> cages than in conventional cages could be attributed to other factors, such as the presence of wood shavings or a nest box. The wider feed trough space per hen in conventional than in <b>furnished</b> cages may partly explain the higher feed consumption observed in conventional cages. ...|$|R

5|$|During his lifetime, Morris {{produced}} {{items in}} a range of crafts, mainly those to do with <b>furnishing,</b> including over 600 designs for wall-paper, textiles, and embroideries, over 150 for stained glass windows, three typefaces, and around 650 borders and ornamentations for the Kelmscott Press. He emphasised the idea that the design and production of an item should not be divorced from one another, and that where possible those creating items should be designer-craftsmen, thereby both designing and manufacturing their goods. In the field of textile design, Morris revived a number of dead techniques, and insisted on the use of good quality raw materials, almost all natural dyes, and hand processing. He also observed the natural world first hand to gain a basis for his designs, and insisted on learning the techniques of production prior to producing a design.|$|E

5|$|The {{electric}} {{fire engine}} would have several advantages over the steam fire engine.

In the case of an electric motor running a fire engine water pump, its operation was basically instantaneous since the motor was running at full power capacity when the switch was turned on. The advantage of using electricity was its lower cost overall, (i.e. no coal or extensive maintenance) and simplicity of operation.|$|E
