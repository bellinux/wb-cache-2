5|$|Nuclear weapons testing, {{uranium mining}} and export, {{and nuclear power}} <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> the subject of public debate in Australia, and the anti-nuclear {{movement}} in Australia has a long history.

5|$|The {{architecture}} of Norway has evolved {{in response to}} changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations and cultural shifts. While outside architectural influences are apparent in much of Norwegian architecture, they <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> adapted to meet Norwegian climatic conditions, including: harsh winters, high winds and, in coastal areas, salt spray.|$|E

5|$|Although Sunday schools such as {{the ones}} {{established}} by Trimmer <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> characterized by modern scholars as a repressive device used by the middle class to impose their morality on the lower classes, Thomas Laqueur has argued that the poor embraced this opportunity to obtain literacy and disregarded many of the moral lessons forced upon them.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> favourable, {{there have been}} criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and dismissal of the wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E
5000|$|Critical {{reception}} to Kogami's character <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> positive {{due to his}} {{traits and}} role in the series while his rivalry with Makishima <b>has</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> praised.

5|$|Anarchism {{does not}} offer a fixed body of {{doctrine}} from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not {{all of which are}} mutually exclusive. Anarchist schools of thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> divided into the categories of social and individualist anarchism or similar dual classifications.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do {{the great majority of}} Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{movements}} have campaigned {{and continue to}} campaign for women's rights, {{including the right to}} vote, to hold public office, to work, to earn fair wages or equal pay, to own property, to receive education, to enter contracts, to have equal rights within marriage, and to have maternity leave. Feminists have also worked to promote bodily autonomy and integrity, and to protect women and girls from rape, sexual harassment, and domestic violence. Changes in dress and acceptable physical activity <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> part of feminist movements.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of his}} career, Peart {{had never}} {{publicly}} identified with any political party or organization in Canada or the United States. Even so, his political and philosophical views <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> analyzed through his work with Rush and through other sources. In October 1993, shortly before that year's Canadian federal election, Peart appeared with then-Liberal Party leader Jean Chrétien in an interview broadcast in Canada on MuchMusic. In that interview, Peart stated he was an undecided voter who supported Quebec federalism.|$|E
5|$|Jolie's {{public image}} is {{strongly}} tied to her perceived beauty and sex appeal. Many media outlets, including Vogue, People, and Vanity Fair, have cited her as the world's most beautiful woman, while others such as Esquire, FHM, and Empire have named her the sexiest woman alive; both titles <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> based on public polls in which Jolie places far ahead of other celebrity women.|$|E

MIT alumnus and faculty member George Ellery Hale {{played a central role in}} the development of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech), and other faculty members have been key founders of Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering in nearby Needham, Massachusetts.|$|E

5|$|Many {{mechanisms}} {{have been}} proposed for animal navigation: there is evidence {{for a number of}} them. Investigators <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> forced to discard the simplest hypotheses - for example, some animals can navigate on a dark and cloudy night, when neither landmarks nor celestial cues like sun, moon, or stars are visible. The major mechanisms known or hypothesized are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Many {{risk factors}} and {{protective}} factors have been proposed, sometimes in relation to theories concerning possible mechanisms of the disease, however, none have been conclusively related to PD by empirical evidence. When epidemiological studies {{have been carried out}} in order to test the relationship between a given factor and PD, they <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> flawed and their results have in some cases been contradictory. The most frequently replicated relationships are an increased risk of PD in those exposed to pesticides, and a reduced risk in smokers.|$|E
5|$|The reason Byzantine Greek merchants <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> {{neglected}} in historiography {{is not that}} they were any less able than their ancient or modern Greek colleagues in matters of trade. It rather originated with the way history was written in Byzantium, which was often under the patronage of their competitors, the court, and land aristocracy. The fact that they were eventually surpassed by their Italian rivals is attributable to the privileges sought and acquired by the Crusader States within the Levant and the dominant maritime violence of the Italians.|$|E

5|$|Triassic temnospondyls {{were often}} the {{dominant}} semiaquatic animals in their environments. Large assemblages of metoposaurs {{with hundreds of}} individuals preserved together {{have been found in}} the southwestern United States. They <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> interpreted as mass death events caused by droughts in floodplain environments. Recent studies show these dense assemblages were instead probably the result of currents accumulating dead individuals in certain areas. These environments seem to have had little diversity, as they were inhabited almost exclusively by metoposaurs.|$|E
5|$|As a vespid wasp, P. exclamans nests are {{typically}} {{made up of}} paper with a single layer of cells with open combs. Although nest size varies, the upper limit is around 500 cells. Although many vespid wasp nests have an outer envelope of paper, P. exclamans nests do not. As indicated by Strassmann and Orgren, “Nests are approximately circular, and have a single off-center pedicel usually located towards {{the top of the}} nest. Cells near the pedicle are the oldest.” P. exclamans are particularly able to colonize new sites as foundresses often disperse into new territories. P. exclamans <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> found to have nests located near man-made structures and tend to more readily build nests in and near these man-made structures. Out of six wasp species, P. exclamans {{was the only one that}} occupied artificial nesting sites. It prefers well-lit, open sites.|$|E
5|$|At the {{national}} competition, Schools compete based on size and {{are divided into}} three divisions (I, II, and III). However, this separation is only limited to overall team score and overall individual score. Nine overall team medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for each division. Similarly, 27 overall individual medals are awarded: gold, silver and bronze for Honors, Scholastic, and Varsity in each division. The rest of the medals—for example, gold in art for Honors, or silver in math for Varsity—are awarded to the top scoring persons regardless of division. In addition, winning teams <b>have</b> <b>often</b> <b>been</b> invited to meet the President of the United States.|$|E
