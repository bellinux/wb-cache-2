25|$|Ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), {{also known}} as {{ribonucleoside}} diphosphate reductase (rNDP), is an enzyme that catalyzes the formation of deoxyribonucleotides from ribonucleotides. Deoxyribonucleotides in turn {{are used in the}} synthesis of DNA. The reaction catalyzed by RNR is strictly conserved in all living organisms. Furthermore, RNR plays a critical role in regulating the total rate of DNA synthesis so that DNA to cell mass is maintained at a constant ratio during cell division and DNA repair. A somewhat unusual feature of the RNR enzyme is that it catalyzes a reaction that proceeds via a free radical mechanism of action. The substrates for RNR are ADP, GDP, CDP and UDP. dTDP (<b>deoxythymidine</b> diphosphate) is synthesized by another enzyme (thymidylate kinase) from dTMP (<b>deoxythymidine</b> monophosphate).|$|E

The integrity of the DNA was maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including DNA topoisomerase, DNA ligase and other DNA repair enzymes. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of three-nucleotide codons, thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 amino acids were used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids.|$|E

We describe a molecular imaging approach for the specific, non-invasive detection of S. aureus {{based on the}} activity of its secreted nuclease, micrococcal nuclease (MN). Several short, synthetic oligonucleotides, rendered resistant to mammalian serum nucleases by various chemical modifications, flanked with a fluorophore and quencher, were activated upon degradation by recombinant MN and in S. aureus culture supernatants. A probe consisting {{of a pair of}} <b>deoxythymidines</b> flanked by several 2 ′-O-methyl-modified nucleotides was activated in culture supernatants of S. aureus but not in culture supernatants of several other pathogenic bacteria. Systemic administration of this probe to mice bearing bioluminescent S. aureus muscle infections resulted in probe activation at the infection sites in an MN-dependent manner. This novel bacterial imaging approach has potential clinical applicability for S. aureus and several other medically significant pathogens.

40|$|A new {{approach}} for modification interference studies is presented. It {{involves the use}} of phosphorothioates as a handle to analyze any desired base or sugar modification. This method was applied to identify ribose and phosphate moieties which could be important in the pre-tRNA recognition of E. coli RNase P RNA (M 1 RNA). The utility of this technique was confirmed by detecting the inhibitory effect of a deoxyribose in the 5 '-flank (position- 1). This site was already known to interfere with RNase P cleavage, if modified. We have analyzed pre-tRNA(Tyr) and pre-tRNA(Phe) and found different interference patterns for both tRNAs. Two unpaired regions were involved in both pre-tRNAs. Phosphorothioates interfered at the transition between acceptor- and D-arms. The results with <b>deoxythymidines</b> in the T-loop indicated that deoxyribose moieties or the extra methyl group in thymidine could interfere with RNAse P cleavage. These data suggest that even in complete pre-tRNAs, only a few intact ribonucleotides are important in the substrate recognition by RNase P. We have demonstrated the potential of this {{new approach}} which offers many future applications in all fields involving nucleic acids, for example RNA processing, action of ribozymes, tRNA charging and studies related to DNA promoter recognition...|$|R
40|$|The {{circadian}} oscillator of the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus {{is composed}} of only three proteins, KaiA, KaiB, and KaiC, which together with ATP can generate a self-sustained ~ 24 hour oscillation of KaiC phosphorylation for several days. KaiA induces KaiC to autophosphorylate whereas KaiB blocks the stimulation of KaiC by KaiA, which allows KaiC to autodephosphorylate. We propose and support a model in which the C-terminal loops of KaiC, the ?A-loops?, are the master switch that determines overall KaiC activity. When the A-loops are in their buried state, KaiC is an autophosphatase. When the A-loops are exposed, however, KaiC is an autokinase. The data suggest that KaiA stabilizes the exposed state of the A-loops through direct binding. We also show evidence that if KaiA cannot stabilize the exposed state KaiC remains hypophosphorylated. We propose that KaiB inactivates KaiA by preventing it from stabilizing the exposed state of the A-loops. Thus, KaiA and KaiB likely act by shifting the dynamic equilibrium of the A-loops between exposed and buried states, which shifts the balance of autokinase and autophosphatase activities of KaiC. A-loop exposure likely moves the ATP closer to the sites of phosphorylation and we show {{evidence in support of}} how this movement may be accomplished. Density functional theory calculations of isolated Watson?Crick A:U and A:T base pairs predict that adenine 13 C 2 trans-hydrogen bond deuterium isotope shifts due to isotopic substitution at the pyrimidine H 3, 2 h? 13 C 2, are sensitive to the hydrogen-bond distance between the N 1 of adenine and the N 3 of uracil or thymine, which supports the notion that 2 h? 13 C 2 is sensitive to hydrogen-bond strength. Calculated 2 h? 13 C 2 values at a given N 1 ?N 3 distance are the same for isolated A:U and A:T base pairs. Replacing uridine residues in RNA with 5 -methyl uridine and substituting <b>deoxythymidines</b> in DNA with deoxyuridines do not statistically shift empirical 2 h? 13 C 2 values. Thus, we show experimentally and computationally that the C 7 methyl group of thymine has no measurable affect on 2 h? 13 C 2 values. Furthermore, 2 h? 13 C 2 values of modified and unmodified RNA are more negative than those of modified and unmodified DNA, which supports our hypothesis that RNA hydrogen bonds are stronger than those of DNA. It is also shown here that 2 h? 13 C 2 is context dependent and that this dependence is similar for RNA and DNA...|$|R
