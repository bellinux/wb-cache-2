The Switches also include {{an integrated}} packet sniffer built into every port that can export the information on to a web page report (see the jpg to the right, an example of top 25 talkers on a switch) or export the information to an IPFIX server. The web base reports will report top 10, 25, or 50 talkers. Reports can also be created and sorted on source address, destination address, TOS, protocol, port number, source or destination ports, packet count, byte count, or first or last packet times. Multiple ports can be monitored simultaneously or individually. A license {{is not required to}} enable this function. The Management of the system is accomplished through a serial console (which presents both a menu structure and a command line interface), a web interface or with the device manager tools, which uses SNMP to communicate with the device.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} the results of reciprocating compressors operation under the control of Vibration-Based <b>Diagnostics</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems, dwells upon the issues of usage of reciprocating compressors valves by various vendors and their influence on compressorsâ€™ vibroactivity. An adequate evaluation of vibroactivity of piston machines is provided by the Russian regulative database on vibration parameters. Main differences of Russian and global methods of reciprocating compressors health evaluation, particularly, used frequency range, are presented in the article. It is shown that the approach laid in Russian standards on reciprocating compressors vibration regulations, ensures true-to-life assessment of reciprocating compressors assemblies and details condition. The examples given in the article confirm that the criteria of reciprocating compressors repair correctness assessment should be the machinery health, including its vibroactivity, not just mindless usage of new components purchased from the global brands.

Design studies, with field testing on each selected system component, are required to determine the parameters to be measured and to establish monitoring protocols.
