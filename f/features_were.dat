5|$|Based on Japanese mythology, Orochimaru {{was created}} {{as one of}} the series' main antagonists, and {{intended}} to represent the opposite of the protagonists' morals and values.

40|$|A new hidden Markov model (HMM) is {{proposed}} for on-line character recognition using two typical features, pen-direction feature and pen-coordinate feature. These two <b>features</b> <b>are</b> quite different in their stationarity; pen-direction <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> stationary within every line segment {{of a stroke}} whereas pen-coordinate <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> not. In the proposed HMM, these contrasting <b>features</b> <b>are</b> used in a separative and selective way. Specifically speaking, pen-direction <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> outputted repeatedly at intra-state transition whereas pen-coordinate <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> outputted once at inter-state transition. The superiority of the proposed HMM over the conventional HMMs was shown through single-stroke and multi-stroke character recognition experiments. 1...|$|R

5|$|In 1984, a {{candidate}} for a Roman fort was identified by aerial photography at Easter Galcantray, south west of Cawdor. The site was excavated between 1984 and 1988 and several <b>features</b> <b>were</b> identified which are supportive of this classification.

40|$|Abstract- The process {{being used}} to {{recognize}} a form includes extracting {{a wide variety of}} features that allow the recognizing procedure to sufficiently characterize a form. The first <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> based on the logo of the form. The logo is a distinct picture that appears on a form. The second <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the form identification (to be called “id”) which is unique to each form. The third <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> the structural lines. The fourth <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> a check box counting routine. The last <b>feature</b> <b>is</b> a word counting routine. Together, these <b>features</b> <b>are</b> utilized to extract vital characteristics that lead to a confident classification of the form. Current results within the form classification algorithm, which uses all the aforementioned features, yields a high accuracy...|$|R
