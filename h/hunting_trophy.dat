5|$|Sultan did not {{initially}} have any male heirs {{and it is}} possible that Usama expected to succeed him. He certainly singled him out among his brothers by teaching him, tutoring him in the ways of war and hunting. He even favoured him for personal missions and as a representative. However, after Sultan had his own son, he no longer appreciated the presence of Usama and Murshid's other sons. According to Usama, Sultan was jealous after a particularly successful lion-hunt in 1131 when he entered the town with a large lion head in his arms as a <b>hunting</b> <b>trophy.</b> When his grandmother saw this she warned him about the effect this could have on his uncle. However, despite this he still spoke well of his uncle on a few occasions in his autobiography and highlighted his noble actions. Usama ultimately left Shaizar temporarily in 1129 and after his father died in 1137 his exile became permanent.|$|E

I knew that if I were {{face to face with}} him I could tear his throat out, but I must so arrange that the fashion of his death should be a {{noiseless}} one. There was a <b>hunting</b> <b>trophy</b> in the hall, and from it I took a straight heavy knife which I sharpened upon my boot. Then I stole to my room, and sat waiting upon the side of my bed. I had made up my mind what I should do. There would be little satisfaction in killing him if he was not to know whose hand had struck the blow, or which of his sins it came to avenge. Could I but bind him and gag him in his drunken sleep, then a prick or two of my dagger would arouse him to listen to what I had to say to him. I pictured the look in his eyes as the haze of sleep cleared slowly away from them, the look of anger turning suddenly to stark horror as he understood who I was and what I had come for. It would be the supreme moment of my life.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> has {{potential}} to support conservation financing and contribute towards rural development. We conducted a systematic {{review of the}} Zimbabwean <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> perspective spanning from pre- 1890 to 2015, by examining the following: (1) evolution of legal instruments, administration, and governance of <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting,</b> (2) significance of <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> in conservation financing and rural development, and (3) key challenges, emerging issues in <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> industry, and future interventions. Our review shows that (i) {{there has been a}} constant evolution in the policies related to <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> and conservation in Zimbabwe as driven by local and international needs; (ii) <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> providing incentives for wildlife conservation (e. g., law enforcement and habitat protection) and rural communities’ development. Emerging issues that may affect <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> include illegal hunting, inadequate monitoring systems, and hunting bans. We conclude that <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> is still relevant in wildlife conservation and rural communities’ development especially in developing economies where conservation financing is inadequate due to fiscal constraints. We recommend the promotion of net conservation benefits for positive conservation efforts and use of wildlife conservation credits for the opportunity costs associated with reducing <b>trophy</b> <b>hunting</b> off-take levels and promoting nonconsumptive wildlife use options...|$|R
