25|$|The {{concept of}} id impulses comes from Sigmund Freud's {{structural}} model. According to this theory, id impulses {{are based on}} the pleasure principle: instant gratification of one's own desires and needs.

25|$|Early acts {{of violent}} {{resistance}} were often motivated more by <b>instinct</b> <b>and</b> fighting spirit than by any formal ideology, but later several distinct political alignments and visions of post-liberation France developed among the Résistance organisations.

25|$|Donkeys have {{a notorious}} {{reputation}} for stubbornness, {{but this has}} been attributed to a much stronger sense of self-preservation than exhibited by horses.

25|$|There is {{considerable}} debate {{on whether or}} not certain breeds of dogs are inherently more prone to commit attacks causing serious injury (i.e., so driven by <b>instinct</b> <b>and</b> breeding that, under certain circumstances, they are exceedingly likely to attempt or commit dangerous attacks). Regardless of the breed of the dog, it is recognized that the risk of dangerous dog attacks can be greatly increased by human actions (such as neglect or fight training) or inactions (as carelessness in confinement and control).|$|E
25|$|Awareness {{in species}} is {{difficult}} to determine. Learned behaviors that have been demonstrated in laboratories have provided good evidence that animals have <b>instinct</b> <b>and</b> a reward system. The behavior of laboratory animals demonstrates a mental experience wherein the animal's instincts tell it if it carries out a certain action, it will then receive what it needs. For example, the lab rat will push the lever because it knows food will {{fall out of the}} hole in the wall. It doesn’t need awareness, but it does seem to work on a reward system. The lab rat learned the action needed to be fed.|$|E

25|$|The Call of the Wild {{is a short}} {{adventure}} novel by Jack London published in 1903 and set in Yukon, Canada during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush, when strong sled dogs were in high demand. The central character {{of the novel is}} a dog named Buck. The story opens at a ranch in Santa Clara Valley, California, when Buck is stolen from his home and sold into service as a sled dog in Alaska. He becomes progressively feral in the harsh environment, where he is forced to fight to survive and dominate other dogs. By the end, he sheds the veneer of civilization, and relies on primordial <b>instinct</b> <b>and</b> learned experience to emerge as a leader in the wild.|$|E
25|$|Genes are cogs in the machine, not gods in the sky. They are {{switched}} {{on and off}} throughout life, by external as well as internal events, {{their job is to}} absorb information from the environment at least as often as to transmit it from the past. Genes do more than carry information; they respond to experience. Susan Mineka illustrated this concept exceedingly well with her idea of prepared learning in monkeys, where she found the predisposition of genes largely affected the acquisition of fear responses to certain stimuli. Lab-reared monkeys, through vicarious experience, were easily able to acquire a fear response to a snake, but not a flower. Nature provides the <b>instinct,</b> <b>and</b> elements of nurture depend on whether the instinct is expressed.|$|E

25|$|Rivers further {{asserted}} that all painful or un-useful instincts are naturally {{kept out of}} conscious awareness (i.e. in the unconscious) by suppression. Suppression—in this view—is a natural and “unwitting” (unintentional) method for removing painful instincts from consciousness and confining them in the unconscious. Neuroses, therefore, develop when something in the natural process of suppression is disrupted so that a suppressed <b>instinct</b> <b>and</b> its associated emotion are released from the unconscious. Rivers cites two possible reasons for the “escape” of such instincts from the unconscious: either the instinct became too strong to contain, or the normal reserves which typically suppress it were weakened. It is important to note, however, that the etiology of war neuroses is not simply the escape of instincts from the unconscious and the ensuing conflict. More often than not, Rivers believed that {{the way in which}} such conflict is resolved (or is attempted to be resolved) also greatly influences the manifestation of the neuroses.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea for}} Cosmos and Psyche began when Tarnas {{realized}} that {{the climax of the}} 1960s cultural revolution took place precisely during the only Uranus-Pluto conjunction in the 20th century. For Tarnas, the characteristics of the astrological entity Uranus match with those of the Greek mythical figure Prometheus better than with those of the conservative mythological figure Uranus. Tarnas associates the astrological planet Uranus with freedom and change, while Pluto is associated with evolution, <b>instinct,</b> <b>and</b> eros. Thus in Tarnas's theory, the apparent relationships (conjunctions, oppositions, and squares) of Uranus and Pluto have momentous potential for human history. (Tarnas's research has not found significant correlation between the zodiac signs and human events.) Tarnas further observed that a Uranus-Pluto opposition occurred during the French Revolution. Like the 1960s, the French Revolution featured the characteristics of Uranus-Pluto alignment: revolution through the manifestation of the suppressed. These historical-astrological coincidences or synchronicities led Tarnas to further explore the relationship of pivotal moments in Western cultural history to the conjunctions, oppositions, and squares of the outer planets. The historical events analyzed include the Reformation, the Renaissance, Romanticism, the Scientific Revolution, the Industrial Revolution, Modernism, Postmodernism, etc.|$|E
25|$|Nietzsche {{found in}} {{classical}} Athenian tragedy {{an art form}} that transcended the pessimism found in the so-called wisdom of Silenus. The Greek spectators, by looking into the abyss of human suffering depicted by characters on stage, passionately and joyously affirmed life, finding it worth living. A main theme in The Birth of Tragedy was that the fusion of Dionysian and Apollonian Kunsttrieben ("artistic impulses") forms dramatic arts, or tragedies. He goes on to argue that this fusion has not been achieved since the ancient Greek tragedians. Apollo represents harmony, progress, clarity and logic, whereas Dionysus represents disorder, intoxication, emotion and ecstasy. Nietzsche used these two forces because, for him, the world of mind and order on one side, and passion and chaos on the other formed principles that were fundamental to the Greek culture: the Apollonian side being a dreaming state, full of illusions; and Dionysian being the state of intoxication, representing the liberations of <b>instinct</b> <b>and</b> dissolution of boundaries. In this mold, man appears as the satyr. He is {{the horror of the}} annihilation of the principle of individuality {{and at the same time}} someone who delights in its destruction. Both of these principles are meant to represent cognitive states that appear through art as the power of nature in man.|$|E

25|$|Overall, Rivers {{attributed}} the neuroses to both (i) the escape of painful <b>instincts</b> <b>and</b> their associated emotions from the unconscious and (ii) the mind's unsuccessful efforts to force such <b>instincts</b> <b>and</b> their emotions {{back into the}} conscious. While Rivers' theory contains some Freudian elements, {{it is not simply}} a restatement of psychoanalytic theory; Rivers' theory of the neuroses draws heavily on the neurological observations and conclusions Rivers and Henry Head drew from their work on nerve regeneration.|$|R

25|$|According to the Tübingen interpretation, the two {{opposing}} principles determine {{not only the}} ontology of Plato's system, but also its logic, ethics, epistemology, political philosophy, cosmology, and psychology. In ontology the opposition of the two principles corresponds to the opposition between Being and Not-Being. The more the Indefinite Dyad influences a thing, the less it has of Being and the lower its ontological rank. In logic, the One supplies identity and equality, while the Indefinite Dyad supplies difference and inequality. In ethics, the One signifies Goodness (or virtue, aretḗ), while the Indefinite Dyad signifies Badness. In politics, the One gives to a populace that which makes it into a unified political entity and enables it to survive, while the Indefinite Dyad leads to faction, chaos, and dissolution. In cosmology, the One is evidenced by rest, persistence, and the eternality of the world, {{as well as the}} presence of life in the cosmos and the pre-determined activity of the Demiurge Plato mentions in his Timaeus. The Indefinite Dyad is in cosmology the principle of movement and change, and especially of impermanence and death. In epistemology, the One stands for philosophical knowledge that rests upon acquaintance with Plato's unchanging Forms, while the Indefinite Dyad stands for mere opinion that is dependent upon sensory impressions. In psychology or the theory of the soul, the One corresponds to Reason, and the Indefinite Dyad to the sphere of <b>instinct</b> <b>and</b> bodily affects.|$|E

Sampson argues that while it may seem attractive to argue the nature side of the 'nature versus nurture' debate, the nurture side may better support the creativity and nobility of the human mind.
