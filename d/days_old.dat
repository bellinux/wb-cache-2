40|$|One and two <b>day</b> <b>old</b> mice {{responded to}} the T-independent {{synthetic}} polypeptide poly (DTyr,DGlu) -poly(DPro) [...] poly(DLys) with high antibody production, whereas a dramatic decrease was observed in the immune response of 3 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> injected animals. The presence and expression of suppressor T cells in the 3 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> newborn mice spleens was demonstrated by transferring spleens of 3 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> mice into either thymectomized, irradiated recipients together with bone-marrow cells, or into 1 [...] 2 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> newborn recipients. In both cases a significantly lower antibody response was observed in recipients of the 3 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> newborn spleen cells as compared to recipients of {{the same number of}} adult spleen cells. No decrease in the antibody levels was detected following inoculation of 3 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> spleen cells after anti-theta-treatment, while enriched T cell populations obtained from nylon wool columns had the same suppressive effect as the whole spleen cell preparations.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{development}} of phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) and lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) -metabolising enzyme activities in the neonatal rat intestine {{and its relation to}} the intestinal permeability of macromolecules. The permeability was determined by feeding young rats a mixture of bovine serum albumin, bovine immunoglobulin G and fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated dextran 70, 000, and analysing the serum concentrations after six hours. The animals were then killed and the intestinal mucosa was homogenised and assessed for PLA 2 and lysoPC-metabolising enzyme activities. The intestine was 'open' to the macromolecules in 14 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> animals, but 'closed' in 22 and 32 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> animals and in 14 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> rats treated with cortisone acetate on day 10, 11, and 12 postpartum. The activity of PLA 2 (at pH 6 and 2 mM Ca 2 +) was higher in 32, 22, and cortisone treated 14 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> animals, than in untreated, 14 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> animals. Incubation of 14 C-acyl-lysoPC with mucosa from 14 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> rats did not change the radioactivity pattern as shown by thin layer chromatography, whereas after incubation with mucosa from 22 or 32 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> animals all the radiolabel was found in free 14 C-fatty acid and in 14 C-phosphatidylcholine. These findings indicate that mucosal PLA 2 activity increases during intestinal maturation and that the mucosa acquires the ability to acylate and deacylate lysoPC when it is 'closed' to macromolecules...|$|R
40|$|Monoamine and {{acetylcholine}} in rat heart {{were studied}} embrylogically. The following results were obtained. Monoamine {{was present in}} the heart in monoaminergic nerves {{which appeared in the}} atrium of the 14 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> fetus and in the ventriculum 3 days after birth. The distribution of monoamine in 7 - 14 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> rat hearts was similar, and that of 35 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> rats was identical to that of adult rats.

The insecticidal activities varied with concentration, compound and the exposure time. The most sensitive stage was 10 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> larvae followed by adult T. castaneum. Eighteen <b>day</b> <b>old</b> larvae were highly tolerant of the tested compounds.

40|$|Wistar female rats {{were exposed}} to {{relatively}} mild concentrations of carbon monoxide (CO) (75 and 150 p. p. m.) from day 0 to day 20 of pregnancy. The results show that splenic macrophage phagocytosis of Candida albicans was significantly decreased in 15 and 21 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> male rats exposed to CO (150 p. p. m.) during pregnancy. Moreover, splenic macrophage killing was significantly reduced in 15 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> male pups prenatally exposed to 75 and 150 ppm of CO.

5|$|Young {{birds have}} a yellowish-red gape. The feather follicles {{appear on the}} fourth day and pin {{feathers}} emerge after a week. Nestlings increase in weight steadily until they are 12 <b>days</b> <b>old.</b> The eyes open on the eighth day, the iris reddish-black while the gape turns red. The young leave the nest after about 16 to 20 days after hatching. They do not have the fork in the tail until three weeks. The parents continue to feed and protect them for a month. Young birds may beg for food for longer, but are often ignored or chased away by the adults. Birds reach breeding condition in about two years.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage they are extremely vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two <b>days</b> <b>old</b> died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E

After a baseline period of 24 to 40 days wheel experience with ad lib food access {{half of the}} animals were food restricted for 16 days by being given {{a limited amount of}} food daily to reduce (and maintain) their body weight at 85 % of their baseline weight. After food restriction the rats were returned to ad lib food access and running was observed for another 16 days. Running performed by the food-restricted rats was compared to the running performed by the continuously ad lib fed control rats. There were pronounced differences in the baseline running between the 3 groups of rats. The 55 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> males and 180 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> females showed high baseline levels of running while the 140 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> males showed low levels of running. Food restriction increased total wheel running by 70 % from the high baseline levels in the 55 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> male group and by 112 % from the low baseline levels in the 140 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> male group, but did not increase running in the female group. The food restriction induced increase in male running occurred only when the rats were decreasing in body weight; running returned to baseline levels for animals maintained at 85 % baseline body weight. Baseline levels of running did not predict the increase in running for any of the rats. When ad lib food access reinstated the high baseline running food-restricted 55 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> males showed a decrease in wheel running to below their baseline and control group levels. This decrease in running was negatively correlated with baseline levels of running, suggested that all runners were approaching a floor level of running. The low baseline running food-restricted 140 <b>day</b> <b>old</b> male rats did not show a decrease in wheel running at refeeding; instead their running gradually declined to baseline levels over about 3 days. After ad lib food access was reinstated there were no long-term consequences of food restriction on wheel running. These results indicate that food restriction induced changes in wheel running are not influenced by age (or some covariate of age, such as body weight) in male rats, but are affected by gender, by baseline levels of running, and are controlled by a separate mechanism than that which causes the individual differences in baseline wheel running...|$|R

The oldest wasp to be {{observed}} in a natural colony was 102 <b>days</b> <b>old.</b> Queens typically live 6 times longer than the workers. There has been some variation observed with the life expectancy of P. exclamans. This has typically been attributed to the colony of origin. It also {{must be noted that}} while there is variation between colonies, there typically is less variation between the original nest and the satellite nest. Variation inside a single colony may also occur {{because of the presence of}} different castes. Foragers, those who frequently travel outside the nest, lead a riskier life and tend to have lower life expectancy than those who stay in the nest. Though, it was observed that colonies with high foraging rates also had higher reproductive rates to compensate for the lower life expectancy. Another interesting aspect that was observed in one nest was that an increase in female population led to lower longevity. This was because the females were more focused on competing to become the next queen than foraging and fulfilling their roles.|$|E
