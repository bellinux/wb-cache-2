40|$|Dissertation supervisor: Dr. Cynthia MacGregor. Includes vita. Competency-based grading {{models are}} {{trending}} {{in public schools}} all across the nation. The driving impetus {{of this study was}} to evaluate the impact of competency based grading in Missouri high school students' achievement. Much of the research is theoretical with a distinct void of extensive research-based analysis of intended outcomes. Secondary school administrators need information and quality research to guide best practices within their buildings. Four key elements are found to be prevalent in all competency-based grading models. First, a comprehensive learning progression aligned to and identifying state standards is developed. Second, levels of proficiency are pre-determined. Third, a meaningful assessment process that emphasizes formative assessment practices promotes learning. Finally, the fourth element is a unified grading policy that promotes academic growth and provides continued learning opportunities. This exploratory sequential mixed methods study first identified schools through a qualitative survey that have fully implemented a competency-based model, are transitioning to a competency-based model, or are maintaining a traditional <b>grading</b> <b>model.</b> After identifying and classifying schools using a competency-based rubric, then Algebra 1 and English 2 EOC scores were analyzed of identified schools fully implementing a competency <b>grading</b> <b>model.</b> Of school principals responding for their respective high schools, 9 % had fully implemented a competency-based <b>grading</b> <b>model</b> prior to 2015. Additionally, 14. 6 % of respondents indicated their schools to be transitioning to a competency-based model. Whether implemented, transitioning, or remaining with a traditional <b>grading</b> <b>model,</b> 90 % of respondents indicated their school had implemented a comprehensive learning progression through a state-aligned curriculum. Analyzing the eight schools fully implementing a competency-based <b>grading</b> <b>model,</b> 50 % of schools improved EOC scores following full implementation in both Algebra 1 and English 2. Of the four schools implementing four or more years, 75 % of these schools increased their Algebra 1 and English 2 scores. Several conclusions can be drawn from this study. One conclusion is that Missouri high schools have moved towards standards based education. Survey responses indicated a trend and interest in competency-based grading models similar to national trends. Survey responses also supported that changing grading practices and reporting systems is an intensive and extensive process. While attempting to quantify learning and analyze impact has proven difficult, some schools have shown an increase in EOC scores and benefited from implementing a competency based model. Three recommendations are given. First, a need for professional development and clear understanding of grading philosophy and practices exists. Second, an understanding of and recognition of implementation process requirements is necessary for educational leaders. Finally, more research is necessary further evaluating the impact as well as completing a human resource cost analysis study for competency-based grading in schools.

Consumer {{responses}} {{were examined in}} an incomplete factorial design where Australian consumers evaluated 216 beef samples derived from 18 cattle killed in Australia and Korean consumers evaluated 216 samples from the same 18 cattle, plus 216 similar samples from 18 Korean cattle. Samples of the Mm. triceps brachii, longissimus dorsi and semimembranosuswere cookedusing grill andKorean barbequemethods. Each samplewas sensory tested by 10 consumers, who scored it for tenderness, juiciness, like flavour, and overall liking. Consumers then graded each sample as either unsatisfactory (2 star), good every day (3 star), better than every day (4 star), or premium (5 star) quality. For those samples assessed by bothAustralian andKorean consumers, the Korean consumers graded {{a higher proportion of}} samples ‘unsatisfactory ’ and a lower proportion of samples ‘premium ’ grade product than Australian consumers. Using a composite meat quality score (MQ 4) to predict grade, a discriminant analysis showed that the Korean consumers had boundary cut-offs for the lower grades, which were ~ 4 – 10 palatability units higher than the Australian consumers. Analysis of the residuals between actual and predicted palatability scores showed that the Meat Standards Australia (MSA) <b>grading</b> <b>model</b> produced relatively unbiased estimates within 2 MQ 4 units for the different consumer groups, muscle and carcass suspension treatments, {{with the exception of the}} M. semimembranosus samples.

40|$|In {{healthcare}} education it {{is essential}} for the students to develop and achieve clinical reasoning skills. Clinical reasoning is complex to teach and learn, and effective assessment methods are also lacking. Virtual Patients (VPs) are interactive computer simulations of real-life clinical scenarios for the purpose of healthcare training, education and assessment. Many VP systems are focused on clinical reasoning and have the possibility to track every interaction from the user and therefore have been suggested to be used for assessment. The overall aim of the thesis was to explore the potential of using VPs for assessment of clinical reasoning in postgraduate paediatric nursing education. Study I evaluated the applicability of VPs for the postgraduate paediatric nursing field and students’ acceptance for using VPs for assessment. Study II aimed to identify how clinically experienced paediatric nurses through clinical reasoning solve complex paediatric VP cases. The study was also aimed to give information about how clinical reasoning might be assessed in VP-based exams for postgraduate paediatric nurse students. Study III evaluated a novel scoring and <b>grading</b> <b>model</b> for VP-based exams. Study IV explored whether formative VP-based assessments in connection with self- evaluations had an impact on postgraduate paediatric nursing students’ development of clinical reasoning abilities and the learners’ discovery of their progression. The findings showed {{that it was possible to}} develop and implement VP cases that reflected specific tasks for paediatric nursing. Students and experienced paediatric nurses found the cases realistic and engaging. Both groups also thought using VPs was an innovative and interactive way to be assessed and that VP cases can be used to assess clinical reasoning. The novel scoring and <b>grading</b> <b>model</b> developed for summative VP-based exams could be used to assess the clinical reasoning process and the clinical decision-making. The model has opportunities to give negative points if not protecting patient safety or doing unnecessary things, which was good. In study III, one group of students performed a VP-based exam in three consecutive courses and a clear progress was detected: 53 % of the students passed the first exam, 63 % at the second and in the last, 84 % of the students passed the exam. The most common reason for deduction of points was due to students asking too many interview questions or ordering too many laboratory tests. In study IV, when VPs were used for formative assessments; the findings showed that students’ understanding of the concept of clinical reasoning, awareness of what to focus on in clinical practice and grasp of the level of clinical competence they would require in future professional practice was improved. The students reported a perceived progression of clinical reasoning ability during the courses (from uncertainty about the competence to self-efficacy). In conclusion, the results of the Thesis indicate that VPs seem to have excellent opportunities to assess clinical reasoning skills. Even though the four studies have been performed within the area of postgraduate paediatric nursing care, most of the results are most certainly applicable and transferable to many other areas within healthcare education...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{demand for}} {{capacity}} in WiFi networks is driving {{a new look}} at transmission scheduling based link layers, particularly in the context of mesh networks. One basic issue here is the use of accurate interference models to drive transmission scheduling algorithms. However, experimental work in this space has been limited. In this work, we use commodity WiFi hardware (specifically, 802. 11 a) for a comprehensive study on interference modeling for transmission scheduling on a mesh setup. We focus on the well-known physical interference model for its realism. We empirically build the physical interference model via a packet reception rate vs. SINR relationship using a measurement driven method. We propose use of the “graded ” version of the model where feasibility of a link is probabilistic, as opposed to using the more traditional “thresholded ” version, where feasibility is binary. We show experimentally that the <b>graded</b> <b>model</b> is significantly more accurate (80 percentile error 0. 2 vs. 0. 55 for thresholded <b>model).</b> However, the <b>graded</b> <b>model</b> has never been considered in algorithmic studies on transmission scheduling.

First, they received the medication list. Secondly, they also received laboratory results and reason for admission and finally, we added medical history. Remarks were divided into 6 categories, i. e. indication without medication, medication without indication, contraindications/ interactions, dosage problems, double medication and wrong medication. Remarks were compared to the remarks made by our expert panel and scored according to our <b>grading</b> <b>model</b> as appropriate (0 to + 3) or missed or potentially harmful (- 1). For each medication error category, the percentage of participants who made this error was computed. After the first evaluation moment, the overall estimated mean percentage score was - 1. 7 % for case A, 3. 9 % for case B, and 8. 7 % for case C. After the second review, this score was 15. 0 % for case A, 19. 8 % for case B, and 22. 2 % for case C.
