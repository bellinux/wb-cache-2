5|$|Despite losing {{much of its}} {{convection}} over land, Hudah {{maintained a}} well-organized cloud structure once in the Mozambique Channel on April3. As a result of moving back over warm waters, the system began to re-intensify, and attained moderate tropical storm intensity at 0000UTC on April4. Meanwhile, a large central dense overcast developed, and Hudah began to track west-southwestward as opposed to its previous westward trajectory. Despite computer forecast models suggesting that Hudah would continue westward, the storm instead turn to a southward drift, giving <b>it</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> strengthen in the Mozambique Channel. This {{was the result of}} a mid-latitude trough weakening the nearby subtropical ridge. By 1800UTC on April5, Hudah was upgraded back to tropical cyclone intensity. A banding eye began to appear on satellite imagery, though it remained generally unstable, and a large banding feature formed over the western half of Hudah. The nearby trough later weakened in intensity, causing the tropical cyclone to move north-northwestward towards the Mozambique coast on April7. It was at this time that Hudah reached a tertiary peak intensity with winds of 160km/h (100mph). The tropical cyclone accelerated northwards throughout the day, eventually making its final landfall near Pebane, Mozambique at 0600UTC on April8 as a slightly weaker storm. Once inland, Hudah rapidly weakened, and was no longer tracked by the MFR by 0000UTC on April9. The JTWC issued its final warning on the system six hours later, as the remnants of Hudah moved through northeastern Mozambique, producing spotty convection.|$|E

Millions cheered Hitler and in the referendum 99.75% said 'yes' to 'Greater Germany'.

25|$|After {{losing the}} Ashes in Adelaide the MCC team played three one day games.

This was not {{required}} in the first game at Wangaratta, Victoria when the Country XI were dismissed for 31 thanks to Peter Loader (5/17), Jim Laker (2/4) and Fred Trueman (1/8). Ted Dexter was out for 8, but Peter Richardson (22) and Raman Subba Row (40) made the runs for a 9 wicket victory. The MCC continued to entertain the crowd and get some batting practice; May made 56, Watson 38, Graveney 50 and Mortimore 50, the Country team using 10 bowlers and Thomlinson taking 3/60 before they ended on 308/8.|$|E

500|$|In December 2015, Bolton, {{who were}} £172.9 million in debt, were handed a {{winding-up}} petition from HM Revenue and Customs over unpaid taxes, and a transfer embargo {{for the following}} month's window. After ending a 17-game winless run, manager Neil Lennon, who had been investigated by the club due to allegations about his personal life, said that the club had [...] "been through hell". On 18 January 2016, the club avoided an immediate winding-up order after their case was adjourned until 22 February to give <b>it</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> either close a deal with a potential buyer or raise sufficient short-term funds from asset sales. The club was said to owe HM Revenue and Customs £2.2m. On 9 April 2016, Bolton lost 4–1 away at Derby County to confirm their relegation to the third tier {{for the first time}} since 1993. Lennon was removed from his position for the final few games of the season, replaced by Academy manager Jimmy Phillips. The financial situation was somewhat improved as a takeover bid by Dean Holdsworth's Sports Shield was successful.|$|E
500|$|During the 2000 presidential election, the {{readiness}} of the 10th Mountain Division became a political issue when George W. Bush asserted that the division was [...] "not ready for duty." [...] He attributed the division's low readiness to the frequent deployments throughout the 1990s without time in between for division elements to retrain and refit. A report from the US General Accounting Office in July 2000 also noted that although the entire 10th Mountain Division was not deployed to the contingencies at once, [...] "deployment of key components—especially headquarters—makes these divisions unavailable for deployment elsewhere {{in case of a}} major war". Conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation agreed with these sentiments, charging that the US military overall was not prepared for war due to post-Cold War drawdowns of the US Military. The Army responded that, though the 10th Mountain Division had been unprepared following its deployment as Task Force Eagle, that the unit was fully prepared for combat by late 2000 despite being undermanned. Still, the Army moved the 10th Mountain Division down on the deployment list, allowing <b>it</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> retrain and refit.|$|E

500|$|The Sandman {{became a}} cult success for DC Comics and {{attracted}} an audience {{unlike that of}} mainstream comics: much of the readership was female, many were in their twenties, and many read no other comics at all. Comics historian Les Daniels called Gaiman's work [...] "astonishing" [...] and noted that The Sandman was [...] "a mixture of fantasy, horror, and ironic humor such as comic books had never seen before." [...] DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz observed that [...] "The Sandman became the first extraordinary success {{as a series of}} graphic novel collections, reaching out and converting new readers to the medium, particularly young women on college campuses, and making Gaiman himself into an iconic cultural figure." [...] Gaiman had a finite run in mind for the series, and it concluded with issue No. 75. Gaiman said in 1996, [...] "Could I do another five issues of Sandman? Well, damn right.
