5|$|Following the 1862 Newburgh Raid into Indiana, {{the federal}} {{government}} had put a regiment of regular cavalry troops in south central Indiana for defensive purposes. After patrolling the border for several months, no new raids materialized, and they were withdrawn in March 1863, leaving only the local militia <b>for</b> <b>defense.</b>|$|E

5|$|A 2007 study {{suggested}} that Massospondylus {{may have used}} its short arms <b>for</b> <b>defense</b> against predators ("defensive swats"), in intraspecies combat, or in feeding, although its arms were too short to reach its mouth. Scientists speculate that Massospondylus could have used its large pollex (thumb) claw in combat, to strip plant material from trees, digging, or for grooming.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may {{have shown that the}} necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion is that they were used <b>for</b> <b>defense,</b> but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E
5|$|Conrad {{completed}} {{construction of}} the castles of Hohensalzburg, Werfen, and Friesach, which Archbishop Gebhard had started to build in 1077. In Styria, he reformed the military organization and administration of church properties, and built strong fortresses. <b>For</b> <b>defense</b> against Hungary, he built strongholds at Leibnitz (Seggau) and Pettau (Ptuj), and Brestanica castle. He also expanded the Burg Deutschlandsberg castle {{at the center of}} the Salzburg possessions in western Styria. In 1131, he made peace with King BÃ©la II of Hungary, which was followed by a long period of stability in the border region.|$|E

5|$|Even after renouncing his {{personal}} use of guns, King had a complex {{relationship with the}} phenomenon of self-defense in the movement. He publicly discouraged it as a widespread practice, but acknowledged that it was sometimes necessary.

5|$|In aikido, as in {{virtually}} all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques. Because {{a substantial portion of}} any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or roll. The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques <b>for</b> <b>defense</b> consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|E
5|$|Kroonland {{served as}} a troopship for about the next year. In early March, U.S. Navy {{ordnance}} officers inspected Kroonland and took measurements in preparation to arm her <b>for</b> <b>defense</b> against submarine attacks. On 13 March, she was assigned guns by the Navy, {{becoming one of the}} first seven ships to be armed. With her arming complete, and carrying an armed naval guard to man the guns, Kroonland sailed for Liverpool on 25 March 1917. Twelve days later, the United States formally declared war on Germany.|$|E

5|$|Lepidopterans {{are soft}} bodied, fragile and almost defenseless while the {{immature}} stages move slowly or are immobile, hence all stages {{are exposed to}} predation by birds, small mammals, lizards, amphibians, invertebrate predators (notably parasitoid and parasitic wasps and flies) as well as fungi and bacteria.

5|$|Once Allied {{troops were}} on the ground, some German units used the Rommelspargel <b>for</b> <b>defense,</b> by cutting them down and using the logs to {{reinforce}} impromptu positions. Sturmmann Karl Vasold of the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend described how his unit dug in under fire in a tank trench and foxholes on the road from Buron to Villons-les-Buissons, and used cut-down Rommelspargel poles to cover their positions and protect them from enemy fire.|$|E

5|$|Shortly after retiring, Sebree {{was given}} a {{farewell}} banquet which included British Field Marshal Herbert Kitchener as a notable guest and California Governor James Gillett as toastmaster. In retirement, Sebree continued to attend Navy functions. In 1916, Sebree reported that the United States Navy lagged behind the world's other major navies. A single dreadnought, he claimed, could ravage the entire Pacific Fleet which {{was at that time}} relying on submarines <b>for</b> <b>defense.</b> The Atlantic Fleet already had dreadnoughts in commission.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{use their}} venom {{to kill or}} subdue prey, {{as well as for}} other diet-related functions, such as digestion. Current {{scientific}} theory suggests that snake venom is not used <b>for</b> <b>defense</b> or for competition between members of the same species, unlike in other taxa. Thus adaptive evolution in snake venom has resulted in several adaptations with respect to these diet-related functions that increase the fitness of the snakes that carry them.|$|E
5|$|The highway was {{considered}} a yardstick by which limited-access highway construction would be measured. Commission chairman Jones called for more limited-access roads to be built across the country <b>for</b> <b>defense</b> purposes, and the turnpike was {{a model for a}} proposed national network of highways planned during World War II. The Pennsylvania Turnpike led to the construction of other toll roads, such as the New Jersey Turnpike and (eventually) the Interstate Highway System. It has been designated a National Civil Engineering Landmark by the American Society of Civil Engineers.|$|E

5|$|The ship's primary {{armament}} {{consisted of}} a dozen 40-caliber 12.7cm Type 89 anti-aircraft (AA) guns in twin mounts.

Katsuragi was also equipped with 22 triple 25mm Type 96 and thirty single Type 96 AA gun mounts, most on sponsons {{along the sides of}} the hull. These guns were supplemented by six 28-round AA rocket launchers. <b>For</b> <b>defense</b> against submarines, the carrier was fitted with six depth charge throwers and carried between six and ten depth charges for them.|$|E
5|$|To protect Rome's eastern territories {{from the}} Parthian Empire, Augustus {{relied on the}} client states of the east to act as {{territorial}} buffers and areas that could raise their own troops <b>for</b> <b>defense.</b> To ensure security of the Empire's eastern flank, Augustus stationed a Roman army in Syria, while his skilled stepson Tiberius negotiated with the Parthians as Rome's diplomat to the East.
