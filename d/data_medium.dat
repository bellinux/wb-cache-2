The limit has been gradually lowered right after and was set to 20,000. Ten albums and one greatest hits were recorded by the Kartel from which five are gold and two are platinas.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Even in {{distance}} learning institutions, the students choose in 80 % {{of the cases}} paper as <b>data</b> <b>medium.</b> Researches have shown that they are primarily motivated by the mobility of the medium itself and the mobility granted to its user. It seemed interesting to examine to what extent currently available mobile devices can offer the students greater mobility and to evaluate their multimedia integration. Paper is the most used <b>data</b> <b>medium</b> in e-learning, but also offers the least possibilities from a technological point of view. At the University of Applied Sciences Valais, several experiments were conducted on mobile technologies (mobile phones, PDA 1, Pocket PC), enabling students to interact with an e-learning platform. The development platform used was i-learn, the platform implemented at the University of Applied Sciences Valais. This paper points out the concrete advantages of mobile learning and describes the development of two types of PDA in relation to an e-learning platform: Palm Pilot and Pocket PC. The technologies and languages used were. net and C++. The pedagogical, technological as well as communicational aspects were taken into account. MOBILITY AND LEARNIN...|$|E

40|$|Unmanned {{systems have}} been cited {{as one of the}} future {{enablers}} of all the services to assist the warfighter in dominating the battlespace. The potential benefits of unmanned systems are being closely investigated – from providing increased and potentially stealthy surveillance, removing the warfighter from harms way, to reducing the manpower required to complete a specific job. In many instances, data obtained from an unmanned system is used sparingly, being applied only to the mission at hand. Other potential benefits to be gained from the data are overlooked and, after completion of the mission, the data is often discarded or lost. However, this data can be further exploited to offer tremendous tactical, operational, and strategic value. To show the potential value of this otherwise lost data, we designed a system that persistently stores the data in its original format from the unmanned vehicle and then generates a new, innovative <b>data</b> <b>medium</b> for further analysis. The system streams imagery and video from an unmanned system (original data format) and then constructs a 3 D model (new <b>data</b> <b>medium)</b> using structure-from-motion. The 3 D generated model provides warfighters additional situational awareness, tactical and strategic advantages that the original video stream lacks.

40|$|Objectivity read/write {{benchmarks}} {{and storage}} overhead measurements are presented. Keywords: 1 Introduction Most {{of the coming}} HEP experiments will use object-oriented database management systems (ODBMSs) as data store. A detailed understanding of the the ODBMS performance is crucial to enable highperformance analysis scenarios. This paper presents performance measurements for di#erent access patterns using the commercial ODBMS Objectivity/DB. Measurements were made for sequential reading, sequential writing and selective reading. Furthermore an experimental and analytical analysis of the storage overhead introduced by Objectivity/DB is given. The ODBMS performance depends on the underlying <b>data</b> <b>medium.</b> At the moment there are no alternatives to hard drives for secondary storage existing. Although the performance/price ratios of both processors and disks are improving, the rate of improvement is greater for processors. Hence, the disk subsystem is emerging as a bottleneck factor in s [...] ...|$|E

The extraction of information on near surface soil moisture from the synthetic aperture radar is well established. The available Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) data onboard ENVISAT with multi-incidence and multi-polarization mode for soil moisture estimation on sloping terrain was investigated. Empirical models were developed to estimate near surface soil moisture in the fallow agricultural fields by incorporating the effects of surface roughness using multi-incidence angle ASAR <b>data.</b> <b>Medium</b> incidence angle (IS- 4) with VV polarization of ASAR data had higher correlation coefficient to volumetric soil moisture content. The ratio of medium (IS- 4) to high incidence (IS- 6) angle could further reduce the effect of surface roughness. The effect of topography on the radar data is taken care by calculating local incidence angle derived from ASTER DEM data. The VV polarization in the sloping terrain provided better results in comparison to VH polarization...|$|E
