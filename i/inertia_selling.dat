In summary:(2) The recipient unsolicited goods may, as {{between himself and}} the sender, use, deal with or dispose of the goods as if they were an unconditional gift to him.(3) The rights of the sender to the goods are extinguished.|$|E

40|$|Verbruikersbeskerming is nie ’n nuwe konsep in die Suid-Afrikaanse reg nie. Otto verklaar tereg dat verbruikersbeskerming reeds in die Romeinse tydperk bestaan het. Die skrywer gee die voorbeeld van die aediles curules wat die Romeinse edikte (waaronder die actio quanti minoris en die actio redhibitoria oftewel die aedilisiese aksies tel) uitgevaardig het. Voorbeelde van statutêre verbruikersbeskerming voor die inwerkingtreding van die Wet op Verbruikersbeskerming 68 van 2008 sluit in die Wet op Vervreemding van Grond, die Wet op Elektroniese Kommunikasies en Transaksies en die Nasionale Kredietwet. Die Wet op Verbruikersbeskerming is egter ’n poging van die wetgewer om wydverstrooide verbruikersbeskermingswetgewing onder een oorkoepelende wet saam te voeg en te reguleer. Dit is die eerste keer in die geskiedenis van Suid-Afrika dat agt fundamentele verbruikersregte aan verbruikers toegeken word. Though {{consumer}} protection {{is not a}} new concept in South African law, the Consumer Protection Act 68 of 2008 is an attempt by the legislature to merge and regulate various widely-scattered {{consumer protection}} legislation under one act. It {{is the first time in}} the history of South African law that a consumer is provided with eight basic fundamental consumer rights. Part C of chapter 2 of the act regulates the consumer’s fundamental right to choose. Part of this right includes section 21 and the protection of consumers in respect of unsolicited goods. The inclusion of unsolicited goods as part of the act aims to bring the South African position more in line with the international position regarding <b>inertia</b> <b>selling.</b> Problems arise in the practical application of section 21 in the unique South African landscape. There are clear similarities between the wording of section 21 and other similar provisions that regulate unsolicited goods in European countries (also member states of the European Union). Because of South Africa’s legal and historical background, the positions in Scotland, Belgium and Germany are discussed comparatively. Statutory regulation of unsolicited goods in these countries has as its origin the implementation of European Directives in the relevant member state, but the manner of implementation in the national law of each country differs. A further purpose of the comparative analysis is to find solutions to questions that arise from the critical analysis and explanation of section 21 and the South African position. The issue regarding the broad definition given to unsolicited goods in terms of section 21 to also include situations where an existing contractual relationship is present between the supplier and consumer is discussed as well as possible problems regarding the time constraints for the recovery of the goods by the supplier and retention of the goods by the consumer. The issue regarding possible transfer of ownership in the unsolicited goods in terms of section 21 (6) is also examined. Although section 21 regulates both unsolicited goods and services the focus of this discussion is on the former (goods). The contribution concludes with recommendations and concluding remarks taking into account the comparative analysis. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this casebook, like others in the Ius Commune Series, is to help uncover common roots, notwithstanding differences in approach, of the European legal systems, {{with a view to}} strengthening the common legal heritage of Europe. It covers the big legal families in the EU and contains judgments from the supreme courts and other courts of the Member States. In view of the importance of EC legislation (eg harmonisation directives and regulations) in this field, the consumer law casebook contains much material derived from Community law, such as extracts from directives (eg on unfair contract terms, distance selling, doorstep selling, product liability, unfair commercial pratices etc) and judgments of the ECJ and national court decisions. Furthermore, attention is paid to the way in which, when interpreting EC directives in the consumer field, the ECJ refers to concepts common to the legal systems of the Member States and how the courts of the Member States incorporate the concepts found in the directives (as interpreted by the ECJ) in their legal systems. The casebook also compares harmonised and pre-harmonised law, especially in the case law of the Member States. It concentrates on private law in the field of consumer protection but also addresses topics, in particular in the field of enforcement, that are primarily a matter of public law.
