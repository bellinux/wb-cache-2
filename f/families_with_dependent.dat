2500|$|In writings, {{speeches and}} interviews, Gingrich {{has argued that}} Medicaid, Medicare, Social Security, and other {{entitlement}} programs are fiscally unsustainable.

Gingrich has argued that the current welfare and unemployment insurance system continues to create work disincentives that trap people in poverty. He has proposed replacing these systems with an offer of guaranteed employment for the able-bodied, preferably in the private sector to save taxpayer money, or retraining. Beneficiaries who work enough hours would receive Medicare vouchers and housing assistance.|$|E

Because of this, many European countries are developing representative domestic schedules to replace outdated criteria. This paper evaluates the state of knowledge of UK domestic occupancy patterns and develops new domestic occupancy profiles for England. The presented research (1) characterizes methods for collecting occupancy data and inferring patterns; (2) identifies and assesses the quality of categories of occupancy patterns used in building simulation; and (3) develops updated occupancy profiles. A systematic scoping review identified social and monitoring surveys as the most deployed data-collection methods. A systematic literature review also established that the occupancy categories most frequently used in UK building simulation are (a) a <b>family</b> <b>with</b> <b>dependent</b> children where the parents work full time; and (b) a retired elderly couple who {{spend most of their}} time indoors. The interview sample from the English Housing Survey 2014 – 15 was used to map household typologies. Results show that categories (a) and (b) combined amount to only 19 % of England’s households, which suggest models are over-reliant on these groups. Considering this result, the paper develops occupancy patterns for England derived from 2015 UK Time Use Survey diaries for each household typology previously identified...|$|R

Indigenous families {{are more likely to}} be sole parent families and less likely to be couple only families without children. In 2000 / 1, the proportion of Indigenous <b>families</b> <b>with</b> <b>dependents</b> on Parenting Payment Single (PPS) was twice the proportion of other Australian families.

This paper up-dates some of the earlier findings using data from the 2001 Population Census and considers the results in the context of the current debate on welfare reform. The focus here will be on families and therefore on family-related welfare payments particularly Parenting Payment Single (PPS) but there are a range of welfare payments that provide the major source of income for many Indigenous adults. Reform of the welfare system therefore has wider implications for the economic well-being of Indigenous families and households than will be discussed here (see for example Morphy and Sanders (2001) for papers on the relationship between the Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) scheme and the welfare system) ...|$|R

Since 2009, the number of asset poor families has increased by 21 percent from about one in five families to one in four families. In order to provide assistance to such asset poor families, Congress appropriated $24 million to administer the Assets for Independence Program {{under the supervision of the}} US Department for Health and Human Services. The program enables community-based nonprofits and government agencies to implement Individual Development Account or IDA programs, which are an asset-based development initiative.

(iv) How can financial strain be mitigated for <b>families</b> <b>with</b> severely <b>dependent</b> members? (v) What {{is the role of}} information constraints for the nature and scope of optimal long-term care policy? We consider a theoretical model of long-term care provision under adverse selection to address these challenges. Our main - and remarkably robust - result is that nursing home care facilitates self selection and mitigates and possibly eliminates distortions in caring levels and transfers. Informational asymmetries may thus lead to care being provided too often within institutions rather than within a family context.
