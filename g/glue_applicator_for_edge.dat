Assessment of exposure to benzene {{was carried out in}} 672 factories in 12 cities in China. Historical exposure data were collected for 3179 unique job titles. The basic unit for exposure assessment was a factory/work unit/job title combination over seven periods between 1949 and 1987. A total of 18, 435 exposure estimates was developed, using all available historical information, including 8477 monitoring data. Overall, 38 % of the estimates were based on benzene monitoring data. The highest time-weighted average exposures were observed for the rubber industry (30. 7 ppm) and <b>for</b> rubber <b>glue</b> <b>applicators</b> (52. 6 ppm). Because of its recognized link with benzene exposure, the association between a clinical diagnosis of benzene poisoning and benzene exposure was evaluated to validate the assessment method that we used in the cohort study.

40|$|Carton board {{packages}} are often closed with an adhesive. The adhesive joint thus formed has {{to meet the}} demands during the entire product life from converting to end-use. The adhesive joint has to be characterized if it is good or bad for the actual application. Today such characterization is done by manually peeling the joint, immediately after the adhesive application in the gluing machine. The manual peel test is a subjective test that is operator dependent. An operator needs long experience to be able to perform a manual peel test. Therefore, the packaging industry is interested in a test method that can objectively predict good or bad adhesive joints. The adhesive joints have been tested in the so-called Y-peel test arrangement. An advantage of the Y-peel test is that it gives an objective result from the force–elongation curve. Testing has been performed with carton boards of two different thicknesses. Hotmelt adhesive was used and the open time was varied in the <b>glue</b> <b>applicator.</b> It was found that the Y-peel test gives results in qualitative agreement with the manual peel test. Moreover, by evaluating the energy consumption (dissipative energy) during the Y-peel test it was possible to obtain not only a qualitative but also a quantitative assessment of the adhesive joint...|$|R
40|$|Many heat <b>applicators</b> <b>for</b> {{hyperthermia}} {{have been}} developed; however, in treatment of noninvasive cancer they can heat only the body surface. At present, {{it is difficult}} to selectively heat deep-seated tumors. It is desirable to develop an applicator with the potential for heating a limited region, but achieving this objective is impossible with present technology. Therefore, our goal is to develop an applicator that can uniformly heat to deep regions of the human body. In this paper, we describe fundamental heating characteristics of an RF hyperthermic system using a rectangular resonant cavity <b>applicator</b> <b>for</b> deep-seated tumors. First, electromagnetic and heat-transfer equations were solved to investigate fundamental heating characteristics of the resonant cavity applicator. In the experiments, a torso-shaped dielectric phantom, which has electrical constants close to human muscle, was used. In comparisons of the measured and calculated results, the tendencies of both heat distributions were in accordance. These results indicated the possibility of heating deep regions; thus, this applicator has the potential to heat deep-seated tumors. 多くの癌温熱治療用加温装置が開発されている. しかしながら,非侵襲な癌温熱治療用加温装置は,人体表面近傍のみの加温が可能である. 現状では,RF波を用いて深部に位置する癌を選択的に加温することは不可能である. 局部加温の可能性を持つ装置を開発することが望ましいが,この目標を達成することは,現状の技術では不可能である. それゆえ,我々は,人体深部までを一様に加温する装置を開発することを目標とした. この論文では,立体空洞共振器をもしいた深部癌温熱治療用RFシステムの基礎的な加温特性について述べる. 初めに,基本加温特性を調べるためにMaxwellの方程式と熱伝導―熱伝達方程式を解いた. 次に, 人体筋肉の電気特性を模した誘電体ファントムを使用し,加温実験を行った. 実験結果と計算結果を比較したところ,深部加温できる傾向は一致した. すなわち,深部癌温熱治療用加温装置としての可能性を持つことが分かった...|$|R
