2500|$|It {{has also}} been noted that the Court of Appeal's {{approach}} to constitutional interpretation in the case reflects the approach taken by the Privy Council in Minister for Home Affairs v. Fisher (1979). Such an approach deems a constitutional instrument as sui generis and calling for principles of interpretation of its own because full recognition and effect {{must be given to}} fundamental rights and freedoms. The Court of Appeal's focus on the suggestion that residents have an entitlement or right to representation rather than on the purpose behind the statute has been described as embracing the Fisher approach and as a departure from the <b>interpretive</b> <b>approach</b> to constitutional interpretation espoused in section 9A of the Interpretation Act read with Article 2(9) of the Constitution. Section 9A requires a purposive approach to be taken when interpreting laws, and states that an interpretation of a law that would promote the purpose or object underlying the written law (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the written law or not) shall be preferred to an interpretation that would not promote that purpose or object. Article 2(9) states: [...] "Subject to this Article, the Interpretation Act (Cap. 1) shall apply for the purpose of interpreting this Constitution and otherwise in relation thereto as it applies for the purpose of interpreting and otherwise in relation to any written law within the meaning of that Act".|$|E

40|$|<b>Interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> to {{governance}} include poststructuralism, constructivist institutionalism, practical philosophy, {{and democratic}} pluralism. All of these <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> share {{a focus on}} meanings, sympathy for bottom-up studies, and an emphasis on contingency. All of them also confront theoretical issues that have arisen from the postfoundational turn within philosophy. They face questions {{about the nature of}} the meanings we study, the possibilities for recentring given an emphasis on diversity, and the normative and policy implications of their approach. Although poststructuralists have made the running in addressing these questions, their answers are ambiguous or even misleading. They often appear, in particular, mistakenly to renounce situated agency along with autonomy. This essay seeks to provide alternative answers to these theoretical questions and thereby to provide a more robust theoretical framework for <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> to governance...|$|R

The social actions have subjective meanings that should be understood in its given context.

40|$|Social science {{research}} training is de-facto occupational socialisation to researcher-roles. To do research, trainees {{need to develop}} and demonstrate advanced scholarship that complies with disciplinary norms and perform tasks to pre-determined standards. Functionalist approaches to occupational socialization underpin the performative and standardised approach to research training common in universities. But {{there is more to}} research training than doing research. If truly successful, trainees will become researchers. They will take on the researcher-role and make it their own. <b>Interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> to occupational socialization help illuminate intra- and inter-personal dimensions of role-taking and role-making, however this approach is rarely used to inform research training strategies. Occasional scholarship reveals ad-hoc application on <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> to research trainee experience (eg., 2 ̆ 2 the journey 2 ̆ 2) supervisor experience (eg., 2 ̆ 2 emotional burden of supervision 2 ̆ 2), research training methods such as peer-learning (eg., informal or fabricated groups, research micro-climates), or research training pedagogy (eg., collaborative learning, co-production). Recently, <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> have been used to inform career-planning strategies for PhD graduates (eg., 2 ̆ 2 Vitae 2 ̆ 2) but this is yet to systematically inform institutional strategies for research-training. To more effectively and efficiently facilitate researcher-role development, research training should consider occupational socialization as an organizing framework, and utilize performative and <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> to role development...|$|R
40|$|All {{political}} scientists offer us their {{interpretations of the}} world. <b>Interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> differ from many others in that they offer us interpretations of interpretations; they concentrate on meanings, beliefs, languages, discourses, and signs, as opposed to, say, laws and rules, correlations between social categories, or deductive models. Of course, this distinction between <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> and others is not an all or nothing affair: sensible interpretivists allow {{that the study of}} laws, correlations, and models can play a role in our exploration of practices; and sensible institutionalists, behavioralists, and rational choice theorists allow that their typologies, correlations, and models can do explanatory work only in so far as they can be unpacked in terms of the actual beliefs and desires of actors. Nonetheless, we can distinguish a family of <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> to political science that stand out in that they focus on meanings and beliefs – a family that includes decentred theory, ethnography, poststructuralism, practical philosophy, and social constructivism, and that overlaps with other approaches such as the constructivist and ideational forms of institutionalism...|$|R

How could this Mencian statement become a credo for so many diﬀerent and often mutually opposed interpretive traditions? The extraordinary “versatility” of the Mencian statement, this article suggests, {{has much to do}} with the rich inherent ambiguity of uninﬂected classical Chinese. By adroitly exploiting the ambiguities of the words yi 意, ni 逆, and zhi 志 as well as its syntax,traditional Chinese critics continually reinterpreted the Mencian statement in a way that justiﬁed their novel <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches.</b> So, by investigating the continual reinterpretation of the Mencian statement, this article maps out the rise of diverse <b>interpretive</b> <b>approaches</b> from pre-Han times through the Qing.
