25|$|Leeds {{finished}} 3rd in {{the league}} during the 1972–73 season, never sustaining a convincing title challenge, but they again mounted impressive cup runs domestically and in Europe reaching two finals. However, in space of two dramatic weeks, Leeds would be the victims {{of one of the}} biggest giant killings in football history and losers {{of one of the most}} controversial European finals. In the 1973 FA Cup Final, a full strength Leeds side was beaten 1–0 by second division Sunderland, and two weeks later a weakened Leeds United side were beaten 1–0 by A.C. Milan in the bad tempered 1973 European Cup Winners' Cup Final. Leeds went into the game missing Bremner, Giles, and Clarke, and also under a cloud of press speculation surrounding Revie, who had been strongly linked with the Everton managers post. This speculation and Revie's revelation one hour before the match, that he had decided to accept the <b>job,</b> <b>created</b> a despressed atmosphere inside the Leeds dressing room, but the remaining players determined they were going to win the trophy as a tribute to their seemingly departing manager. AC Milan opened the scoring in the first few minutes and the rest of the match would be dominated by dubious refereeing decisions; numerous fouls against Leeds were ignored by the referee Christos Michas and the aggravation eventually boiled over in the closing stages, with Norman Hunter being sent off for retaliation as Leeds pushed for an equaliser. Leeds also had two penalty appeals – a handball and a trip on forward Mick Jones inside the Milan penalty area – ignored by the referee. The match ended with missiles being thrown at the Milan players and the match officials by a Greek crowd who had begun the match as neutral observers, but had ended it sympathising with the Leeds players, who gave a lap of honour around the stadium to rapturous applause. The referee Christos Michas was subsequently banned from refereeing for life by UEFA; however despite appeals from Leeds United no replay was awarded by UEFA and AC Milan were never penalised.|$|E

2500|$|The {{economic}} agenda under development initially focused on short-term measures intended {{to hold off}} widespread economic losses so that a longer-term {{economic agenda}} could then be formulated. That approach subsequently shifted to a longer-term stimulus plan, with a goal of creating 2.5 million jobs over a two-year period. With a cost of $700 to $800billion, the stimulus plan would cost {{more than a quarter}} million dollars per <b>job</b> <b>created</b> (divide 750 billion by 2,500,000 yielding $300,000). In a nationally televised interview on December 7, he acknowledged that his agenda has changed over the past month, and that a short-term stimulus package had again become his first priority.

2500|$|Early {{during his}} stint in Cream, Clapton's first Les Paul Standard was stolen. He {{continued}} to play Les Pauls exclusively with Cream (one bought from Andy Summers was almost identical to the stolen guitar) until 1967, when he acquired his most famous guitar in this period, a 1964 Gibson SG, dubbed [...] "the Fool". Clapton used both the Les Paul and the SG to create his self-described [...] "woman tone". [...] He explained in a 1967 interview, [...] "I am playing more smoothly now. I’m developing what I call my 'woman tone.' It's a sweet sound, something like the solo on 'I Feel Free'." [...] Writer Michael Dregni describes it as [...] "thick yet piercing, overdriven yet smooth, distorted yet creamy". [...] The tone is achieved {{by a combination of}} tone control settings on the guitars and Clapton's Marshall JTM45 amplifier. [...] Vintage Guitar magazine identifies [...] "the opening riff and solo of 'Sunshine of Your Love' are arguably the best illustrations of full-blown woman tone". [...] Clapton's [...] "Fool" [...] acquired its name from its distinctive psychedelic paint <b>job,</b> <b>created</b> by the visual art collective also known as the Fool (just before Cream's first US appearance in 1967, Clapton's SG, Bruce's Fender VI, and Baker's drum head were all repainted in psychedelic designs).|$|E

5000|$|Several {{scholars}} have found strong {{evidence for the}} presence of the local multiplier effect. Within tradable industries, Enrico Moretti discovered that, for each additional skilled <b>job</b> <b>created,</b> 2.5 jobs were also generated in the local non-tradable goods and services sectors, and an additional unskilled <b>job</b> <b>created</b> 1 job in the local non-tradable sector. [...] Highly skilled sectors such as technology have the highest multiplier effect with five non-tradable jobs for each technology job. Moretti cites the example of Apple Computers which directly employs only 13,000 workers but generates 60,000 additional service jobs in the area. Of those 60,000, 36,000 are unskilled, such as restaurant or retail workers, while 24,000 are skilled jobs such as doctors or lawyers.Other academics have taken issue with the large magnitude of the local multiplier effect claimed by Moretti. One study reanalyzes the claim of Enrico Moretti that five non-tradable jobs are created for each highly skilled tradable job. Using a modified version of Moretti’s method it found that the true multiplier effect was only 1.02 non-tradable jobs created. Furthermore the study finds that there is no difference on the local multiplier effect between whether the tradable job is skilled or unskilled.|$|E
