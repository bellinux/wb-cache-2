5000|$|In 1974, {{the station}} {{introduced}} its Chermayeff & Geismar-designed [...] "neon" [...] logo (consisting {{of either the}} WGBH call letters or, as seen mainly in promotions and station identifications aired on WGBH-TV, the number [...] "2", rendered in a left and right drop shadow protruding from the text). The logo became iconic for the ident used for WGBH's national shows starting in late 1977, featuring two orange lights tracing an outline of the WGBH logo over a black background, culminating in an orange flash that illuminates the logo. The dark neon lighting and distinctive, jagged electronic audio sounder that accompanied the ID (the latter of which was introduced in 1972) {{were reported to have}} frightened younger viewers (indeed, many people who watched the ID card as children have recollected on social media about how they feared it); in light of this, the ID was shortened to {{the latter part of the}} animation in 1986, and eventually relegated to appearing only after the closing credits of station-produced PBS programs in 1993, with the sound effect accordingly being shortened to conform to PBS's station <b>identification</b> <b>length</b> standards.

40|$|The {{interaction}} between culture {{and consumption of}} immigrants is an important research area {{in a number of}} fields including consumer behaviour, marketing, and ethnic studies. This article offers a specific look at issues related to the impact of acculturation on dining-out behaviour of Chinese immigrants living in the Greater Toronto Area in Canada, and the influence of individual factor of acculturation process (i. e., ethnic <b>identification,</b> <b>length</b> of residence, and age at immigration). This study focused on the similarities and comparisons between recent Chinese immigrants who have been in Canada for ten years or less and established Chinese immigrants who have been in Canada for more than ten years, in terms of their dining-out behaviour in the Greater Toronto Area. There were two samples, the recent Chinese immigrants and the established Chinese immigrants in this study. Snowball sampling was applied to recruit the total 30 participants (15 of each sample). The author started to recruit from two participants of each sample among her friends and relatives and asked the interviewers to recommend another two qualified participants. Semi-structures, in-depth interviews were employed in this study to explore the impact of culture, levels of acculturation, ethnic identity, situational factors of ethnic identification and dining-out behaviour. The interviews were audio-recorded by permission and conducted in the participant’s preferable language (in English or in Mandarin Chinese). Data analysis was guided by several previous conclusions and model in the literatures and conducted in both qualitative (coding) and quantitative (SPSS) methods. The findings resulted in some major conclusions. In terms of similarities, it is found that recent Chinese immigrants and established Chinese immigrants obtained restaurants information mostly from friends and relatives. They also searched on internet for other’s reviews, menus, and printable coupons. Secondly, result showed that Chinese immigrants perceived that because they {{have a long history of}} food, Chinese people are more willing to try different types of food when immigrated to Canada. Thirdly, situational factors such as peer influences played more significant role on dining-out decision making and self ethnic identifications than parental influences. In terms of differences, data indicated that among Chinese immigrants living in the Greater Toronto Area, recent Chinese immigrants had stronger ethnic identity to their original culture, and dined out more frequently than the established Chinese immigrants. Future, the result suggested that the highest level of Chinese ethnic food purchasing behaviour were reported by highest ethnic identifiers (ones who identified themselves as more Chinese). However, there was another important factor that influenced the levels of acculturation in dining-out behaviour more greatly than the length of immigration: the age at immigration. The study found that Chinese immigrants who immigrated at early age had the highest level of acculturation and identified themselves as more Canadian, while ones who immigrated at late life had the lowest level of acculturation and identifies themselves as more Chinese. The findings reflected the impact of culture and consumer acculturation in dining-out among Chinese immigrants in the Greater Toronto Area and could potentially contribute to the marketing implications to both ethnic and mainstream restaurant marketers. This study also gives some future thoughts on the exploration of more variables at individual differences, as well as other perspectives of research conducting such as from psychological or economic perspective...|$|E

Here, using {{molecular}} markers, we redrew the distributional ranges of Calanus species inhabiting the North Atlantic and Arctic Oceans and revealed much wider and more broadly overlapping distributions than previously described. The Arctic shelf species, C. glacialis, dominated the zooplankton assemblage of many Norwegian fjords, where only C. finmarchicus has been reported previously. In these fjords, high occurrences of the Arctic species C. hyperboreus were also found. Molecular markers revealed that the most common method of species <b>identification,</b> prosome <b>length,</b> cannot reliably discriminate the species in Norwegian fjords. Differences in degree of genetic differentiation among fjord populations of the two species suggested that C. glacialis is a more permanent resident of the fjords than C. finmarchicus.

40|$|Pseudo-random signals {{have been}} widely used for system <b>identification.</b> Maximum <b>length</b> binary signals are the best known class of {{pseudo-random}} signals, because of their ease of generation using feedback shift registers, but it is less well known that there are several other classes of binary and near-binary signals with identical, or nearly identical properties. An overview of these classes of signal is given and the design of a new MATLAB routine incorporating all these classes of signal is described. The importance of the choice of MLB signal to use in particular applications is illustrated with the identification of a Wiener system having a quadratic nonlinearity and a cubic nonlinearity. Errors in the measurements of the input-output crosscorrelation function caused by the nonlinearities can be reduced when the signal is used in the estimation of the system weighting function if an appropriate choice of feedback connections and data length used for the estimation are chosen.

40|$|The river reach is a {{pervasive}} term within contemporary river research and applications. Yet, despite its prevalence, {{there is a}} notable lack of consistency in its definition. This paper identifies the presence of two broad types of reach definition within the academic literature: operational, and functional, and argues that a functional definition is more suitable for applications within river research and management. A range of sequence zonation algorithms that were originally derived for geological well log analysis are compared {{for their ability to}} automatically identify functional reach boundaries. An analysis of variance -based global boundary hunting algorithm (Gill, 1970) is identified as the most suitable. To demonstrate the potential practical applications of automatic reach delineation methods, two case studies where functional reach boundaries have been identified are described: first, in a sequence of predicted sediment transport capacities for use in a reach-based sediment transport model; and second, in a sequence of RHS Habitat Quality Assessment scores for <b>identification</b> of <b>lengths</b> of channel in need of habitat restoration efforts.

40|$|A vowel {{recognition}} {{based on}} a pitch-synchronous signal processing is introduced in this paper. The investigation has been made within {{the development of a}} speaker independent system of automatic speech sounds <b>identification.</b> The <b>length</b> of a signal-processing window is equal to the pitch period. This makes the signal analysis more independent of a pitch value than in the case of using a fixed-window analysis. It is known that the most effective analysis could be made if a length of the analyzing window is divisible by the pitch period. Thus the smallest window, which provides the perfect effectiveness of the signal analysis, is used here. The patterns for vowels were generated with a help of the knowledge about the phonological system and phonetic rules of the Russian language. Conducted experiments have shown that phonetically-based patterns dictionary is not less effective for speaker-independent speech recognition than the one generated with a help of clustering analysis. The proposed vowels recognition method was tested on the following material: a set of isolated vowels manually extracted from phonetically representative text, read by a standard male speaker of Russian, and a set of isolated words, read by 10 male and 10 female speakers of Russian.

Material and Methods: PG and CBCT images where analyzed by a single calibrated examiner to determine the presence and the position of the mental foramen (MF), its distance to the lower mandible border, the anterior length of the mental loop (ML) and the bone quality in 82 PR and 82 CBCT. Results: ML was identified in 36. 6 % of PR and 48. 8 % of CBCT. PR showed a magnification of 1. 87 when compared to CBCT. The mean of anterior extension of the inferior alveolar nerve and the distance to the inferior border of the mandible was higher for PR (2. 8 mm, sd 0. 91 mm on the PR, range 1. 5 to 4. 7 mm and 1. 59, sd 0. 9 on the CBCT,range 0. 4 to 4. 0 mm) Conclusions: There is a magnification in PR images with respect to those of CBCT. The differences between CBCT and PR with regards to the <b>identification</b> and <b>length</b> of the ML are not statistically significant.

Since plasticity can occur also in the crystal, <b>identification</b> of the <b>length</b> scale that controls a possible size-dependent plastic behaviour {{is far from being}} trivial. It is found that scaling down the dimensions of an asperity results in a higher contact shear strength. The contact area is dominant in controlling the plastic shear response, because it determines the size of the zone, in and below the asperity, where dislocation nucleation can occur. For a specific contact area, there is still a dependence on asperity volume and shape, but this is weaker than the dependence on contact area alone...|$|R

The analysis of the recorded Earth's oscillating electric field by the two distant monitoring sites of PYR and HIO and {{for a period of time}} of 26 months (October 1 st, 2006 - December 2 nd, 2008) suggests that the specific precursor can successfully resolve the predictive time window in terms of months and for a "swarm" of large EQs (Ms > 6. 0 R), in contrast to the resolution obtained by the use of electric fields of shorter (T = 1, 14 days, single EQ <b>identification)</b> wave <b>length.</b> More over, the fractal character of the "strange attractor like" precursor in the frequency domain is pointed out. Finally, a proposal is made that concerns the continuous monitoring of the specific preseismic attractor in distinct different wave lengths of the oscillating Earth's electric field so that an early warning system can be utilized. As a refinement of the "strange attractor like" methodology, the guide lines of a generalized inversion scheme are presented so that the epicenter of the driving mechanism (seismic epicentral area) can be estimated in a least squares sense.
