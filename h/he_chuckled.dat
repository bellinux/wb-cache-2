60|$|He {{thought and}} he thought {{and he thought}} and he thought, and little by little a plan worked out in his little black head. Then <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> <b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> right out loud, then hurriedly looked {{around to see if}} any one had heard him. No one had, so <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> again. He cocked his head on one side and half closed his eyes, as if that plan was {{something}} he could see and he was looking at it very hard. Then he cocked his head {{on the other side and}} did the same thing.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> {{to himself}} and rubbed his long, nervous hands together.|$|E
60|$|I {{could see}} that Holmes was {{extremely}} pleased, for <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> and rubbed his hands together.|$|E
50|$|Adhry Budiarsha as Ikin (Office Boy) (From Episode 9). <b>He</b> <b>chuckles</b> {{a lot and}} {{inadvertently}} interrupts Dhewo's pick-up {{line for}} Mutia while delivering his coffee.|$|R
60|$|THE ORDERLY. No, Sir. Couldnt stand Mrs. Banger, I expect. Fair caution she is. (<b>He</b> <b>chuckles.)</b> Couldnt help larfin when I sor im op it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>chuckling</b> brutally; [...] "at any rate, they've got {{themselves}} into a trap now--the baggage! They're safe enough. They shall sweat for it!" ...|$|R
60|$|Nutty {{took his}} astonishment, which was {{too great to}} be concealed, as a compliment. <b>He</b> <b>chuckled.</b>|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> immensely at {{the bright}} {{prospect}} of immortality that had suddenly opened up to him.|$|E
60|$|Vernon's {{mind had}} {{returned}} to him glowing and inspired. <b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> as he underlined his Horace.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>chuckling</b> to himself. [...] "The {{question}} now is about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see {{the significance of this}} discovery of mine?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What grounds?' The ex-king {{permitted}} {{himself a}} gesture and {{the ghost of}} a chuckle--why the devil should <b>he</b> <b>chuckle?</b> 'Practically none,' <b>he</b> said. 'But of course with these things one has to be so careful.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That will await {{him when}} he enters port," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>chuckling.</b> [...] "It may give him a sleepless night. He will find it as sure a {{precursor}} of his fate as Openshaw did before him." ...|$|R
60|$|Sir Thomas' always {{prominent}} eyes protruded still further. The {{color of}} his florid face deepened. Suddenly, <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{the scout}} heard {{the talk about}} himself <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> grimly and grasped his rifle tighter than ever.|$|E
60|$|Old Mr. Toad chuckled {{deep down}} in his throat. <b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> and chuckled until he shook all over.|$|E
6000|$|... (She is {{listening}} through the floor. They all stoop or go {{on their knees}} to listen, {{and when they are}} in this position the RECRUITING SERGEANT enters unobserved. <b>He</b> <b>chuckles</b> aloud. In a moment PHOEBE is alone with him.) ...|$|R
6000|$|Now Lightfoot's {{friend who}} had driven the hunter off had seen him row down the river and he had guessed just what was in that hunter's mind. [...] "We'll fool him," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>chuckling</b> to himself, as he walked back towards the shed where poor Lightfoot was resting.|$|R
6000|$|... "We will thwart Rappaccini yet," [...] thought <b>he,</b> <b>chuckling</b> to himself, as he {{descended the}} stairs; [...] "but, let us confess {{the truth of}} him, he is a {{wonderful}} man--a wonderful man indeed; a vile empiric, however, in his practice, and therefore not to be tolerated by those who respect the good old rules of the medical profession." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> again, that silent {{interior}} laugh, and I {{was certainly}} grinning in sympathy {{as he went}} on.|$|E
60|$|All {{the time}} Striped Chipmunk was saying this his sharp little eyes twinkled with {{mischief}} and <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> softly to himself.|$|E
60|$|He {{never came}} out of the entrance, of that I was certain; yet at the end of several minutes <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> at my elbow. Again I ran after him, and again he ran into the cave; but this time I stopped at the mouth. I dropped back a short {{distance}} and watched. He did not come out, yet, as before, <b>he</b> <b>chuckled</b> at my elbow and was chased by me a third time into the cave.|$|E
5000|$|While in the air, Merlin asks Second Banana {{where their}} next booking is, which is {{revealed}} to be in Peoria. Merlin proclaims, [...] "Peoria, here we come!" [...] The cat, paddling a gravity-defying canoe-like boat suspended by balloons, remarks, [...] "And Peoria, here I come!" [...] Merlin then says, [...] "In that case, we open in Hoboken." [...] <b>He</b> <b>chuckles</b> and the screen fades to black.|$|R
60|$|LEO. Dont {{take any}} notice of him, Rejjy. Go {{at once and}} get that odious decree {{demolished}} or annulled or whatever it is. Tell Sir Gorell Barnes that I have changed my mind. [To Hotchkiss] I might have known that you were too clever to be really a gentleman. [She takes Reginald away to the oak chest and seats him there. <b>He</b> <b>chuckles.</b> Hotchkiss resumes his seat, brooding].|$|R
60|$|Reddy Fox said nothing, but {{tried his}} best to look {{disappointed}} and dejected. All the time <b>he</b> was <b>chuckling</b> inwardly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fooled {{you that}} time, didn't I, Peter?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> [...] "You {{thought you were}} going to see Glory the Cardinal, didn't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{young man}} looked at her, and at Nikasti, who out in the {{corridor}} was holding his hat and cane. Then <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Again <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> “Don’t you see there, in the stern-sheets, on the bottom? May I never shoot a seal {{again if}} that ain’t a woman!” ...|$|E
5000|$|Miko Hughes as Joseph, a {{wise and}} {{intelligent}} anatomy-loving boy who enjoys sharing to others about anatomical differences between boys and girls, which he apparently {{learned from his}} father who is a gynecologist. His attitude and wisdom, which draws the class' laughter, is always commended by Kimble (evident when Kimble first hears it and sarcastically says [...] "Thanks for the tip" [...] and when <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> after hearing it for the second time).|$|R
6000|$|THE YOUNG LADY (with cool insolence). Well, so you have! (She gets up.) Why shouldn't you? it's your {{business}} to hurt people. (It amuses {{him to be}} treated in this fashion: <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> secretly as <b>he</b> proceeds to clean and replace his instruments. She shakes her dress into order; looks inquisitively about her; {{and goes to the}} window.) You have {{a good view of the}} sea from these rooms! Are they expensive? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course we}} do. Not {{that you have}} to laugh at Dr. Kennicott so much, but MY man, heavens, now there's a rare old bird! Reading story-books when he ought to be tending to business! 'Marcus Westlake,' I say to him, 'you're a romantic old fool.' And does he get angry? He does not! <b>He</b> <b>chuckles</b> and says, 'Yes, my beloved, folks do say that married people grow to {{resemble}} each other!' Drat him!" [...] Mrs. Westlake laughed comfortably.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{is coming}} {{sensible}} again," [...] <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> [...] "Now that that crank {{is out of}} the way we shall see her as she was--triumphant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A great piece, that Miss Lackland of yours," [...] <b>he</b> <b>chuckled.</b> [...] "Claims to be a {{part-owner}} of Berande. Says she's your partner. Is that straight?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I mean business," [...] he replied. [...] "I ain't no last year's chicken; I {{know when}} the old man sleeps the soundest." [...] <b>He</b> <b>chuckled</b> pleasantly.|$|E
6000|$|... 'She had got a wire. That isn't the joke, though. You see he {{got into}} a hopeless muddle about {{which side of the}} veil he had come out on; and he went off with the other ones, and they wouldn't have him, and he got lost in the veil, running up and down it, calling to us; and just for the lark we didn't answer.' <b>He</b> <b>chuckles,</b> 'I expect <b>he</b> has become a ghost!' With sudden consideration, 'Best not tell his mother that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It worked," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>chuckling.</b> [...] "If Señor Gomez {{was on our}} track, he's weel off it noo. But it's {{fortunate}} we sail the morn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tease him! The {{consideration}} I {{show that}} poor old man, Grizel, while I {{know all the}} time that he is plotting to diddle me! You should see me when it is he who is fidgeting to know why the piano has stopped. He stretches his head to listen, and does something to his ear that sends it another inch nearer the door; <b>he</b> <b>chuckles</b> and groans on the sly; and I--I notice nothing. Oh, he is becoming quite fond of me; he thinks me an idiot." ...|$|R
