5000|$|February 15, 2008 - Skyworks Solutions has {{released}} a front-end module for <b>E-UTRAN.</b>|$|E
5000|$|RAN (Radio Access Network): RAN {{specifies}} the UTRAN and the <b>E-UTRAN.</b> It {{is composed}} of six working groups.|$|E
5000|$|The {{purpose of}} the PTCRB is to provide the {{framework}} within which GERAN , UTRAN , and <b>E-UTRAN</b> device certification can take place {{for members of the}} PTCRB. This includes, but is not limited to, determination of the test specifications and methods necessary to support the certification process for GERAN, UTRAN, and <b>E-UTRAN</b> devices. This group will also be responsible to generate input regarding testing of devices to standards development organizations.|$|E
50|$|E-UTRA is the air {{interface}} of 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Long Term Evolution (LTE) upgrade path for mobile networks. It is {{an acronym for}} Evolved Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) Terrestrial Radio Access, {{also referred to as}} the 3GPP work item on the Long Term Evolution (LTE) also known as the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA) in early drafts of the 3GPP LTE specification. <b>E-UTRAN</b> is the initialism of Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network and is the combination of E-UTRA, user equipment (UE), and <b>E-UTRAN</b> Node B or Evolved Node B (EnodeB).|$|E
50|$|The EPS Mobility Management (EMM) {{protocol}} provides {{procedures for}} the control of mobility when the User Equipment (UE) uses the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (<b>E-UTRAN).</b> It also provides control of security for the NAS protocols.|$|E
50|$|An eNodeB is {{an element}} of an LTE Radio Access Network, or <b>E-UTRAN.</b> A HeNB {{performs}} the same function of an eNodeB, but is optimized for deployment for smaller coverage than macro eNodeB, such as indoor premises and public hotspots.|$|E
5000|$|S1AP (S1 Application Part) is the {{signaling}} service between <b>E-UTRAN</b> and the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) that fulfills the S1 Interface {{functions such as}} SAE Bearer management functions, Initial context transfer function, Mobility {{functions for}} UE, Paging, Reset functionality, NAS signaling transport function, Error reporting, UE context release function, Status transfer.|$|E
50|$|<b>E-UTRAN</b> Node B, {{also known}} as Evolved Node B (abbreviated as eNodeB or eNB), is the element in E-UTRA of LTE that is the {{evolution}} of the element Node B in UTRA of UMTS. It is the hardware that is connected to the mobile phone network that communicates directly wirelessly with mobile handsets (UEs), like a base transceiver station (BTS) in GSM networks.|$|E
50|$|It {{encompasses}} {{several aspects}} of LTE networks, including both the Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> and the Evolved Packet System (EPS). It supports single and heterogeneous multi-cell environments, QoS management, multi users environment, user mobility, handover procedures, and frequency reuse techniques. Four kinds of network nodes are modeled: user equipment (UE), evolved Node B (eNB), Home eNB (HeNB), and Mobility Management Entity/Gateway (MME/GW). Four different traffic generators at the application layer have been implemented and the management of data radio bearer is supported. Finally, well-known scheduling strategies (such as Proportional Fair, Modified Largest Weighted Delay First, and Exponential Proportional Fair, Log and Exp rules), AMC scheme, Channel Quality Indicator feedback, frequency reuse techniques, and models for physical layer have been developed.|$|E
40|$|The present Wireless Technology is 3 G is {{implemented}} by 3 GPP Networks. There {{are many different}} Technologies in the 3 GP Networks to implement; here on of the implementation technology is <b>E-UTRAN.</b> <b>E-UTRAN</b> is System Architecture similar to a wireless Network. In this paper the <b>E-UTRAN</b> Network is implementation is specified by using the 3 GPP Access Networks and Non 3 GPP Access Networks. This paper also describes the implementation of this issues in various aspects...|$|E
30|$|The {{architecture}} {{that we are}} going to consider includes M 2 M devices connected directly or via M 2 M gateways to the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> architecture. The evolved Node Bs (eNBs) in the <b>E-UTRAN</b> are connected to the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) that provides connectivity to the IP backbone. The Evolved Packet System (EPS) including <b>E-UTRAN</b> and EPC forms the M 2 M and the cellular access network. Besides getting access to <b>E-UTRAN</b> through an eNB, the machines can also get access through small cells, such as a relay node (RN) or a Home evolved Node B (HeNB). The aggregated M 2 M and H 2 H traffic collected by the small cells can be routed to a LTE gateway then to an eNB and, finally, to the EPC. In the rest of the paper, we refer to the RNs or HeNBs generically as SCs.|$|E
30|$|The LTE {{system is}} mainly {{composed}} by two parts: the air interface, i.e., the evolved-universal terrestrial {{radio access network}} (<b>E-UTRAN),</b> and the packet switched core network, known as Evolved Packet Core. From the network side, the evolved NodeB (eNB) is the only node of the <b>E-UTRAN</b> {{and it is in}} charge of providing network connectivity through the air interface to all user equipments (UEs) in the cell, according to the classic cellular network paradigm.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a high-level overview of <b>E-UTRAN</b> interworking and interoperability with existing Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) and non- 3 GPP wireless networks. <b>E-UTRAN</b> access networks (LTE and LTE-A) are currently the latest technologies for 3 GPP evolution specified in Release 8, 9 and beyond. These technologies promise higher throughputs and lower latency while also reducing {{the cost of}} delivering the services to fit with subscriber demands. 3 GPP offers a direct transition path from the current 3 GPP UTRAN/GERAN networks to LTE including seamless handover. <b>E-UTRAN</b> and other wireless networks interworking is an option that allows operators to maximize the life of their existing network components before a complete transition to truly 4 G networks. Network convergence, backward compatibility and interpretability are regarded as the next major challenge in the evolution and the integration of mobile wireless communications. In this paper, interworking and interoperability between the <b>E-UTRAN</b> Evolved Packet Core (EPC) architecture and 3 GPP, 3 GPP 2 and IEEE based networks are clearly explained. How the EPC is designed to deliver multimedia and facilitate interworking is also explained. Moreover, the seamless handover needed to perform this interworking efficiently is described briefly. This study showed that interoperability and interworking between existing networks and <b>E-UTRAN</b> are highly recommended as an interim solution before the transition to full 4 G. Furthermore, wireless operators have to consider a clear interoperability and interworking plan for their existing networks before makin...|$|E
30|$|For voice service, the one way {{end-to-end}} delay {{should be}} below 250 [*]ms to guarantee relatively good voice quality rating [18]. The packet delay includes delay in {{evolved packet core}} (EPC) and <b>E-UTRAN.</b> Since {{the focus of this}} study is on <b>E-UTRAN</b> part, we deduct packet processing delay and propagation delay of approximately 100 [*]ms in EPC, the delay budget left for <b>E-UTRAN</b> is around 150 [*]ms. We further assume that both end-users are <b>E-UTRAN</b> users, the tolerable delay for medium access control (MAC) queuing and scheduling as well as physical (PHY) transmission should be strictly within 80 [*]ms. To further improve voice quality and better account for variability in network, 3 GPP uses 50 [*]ms air interface delay bound (one-way delay from eNB to UE) in LTE system performance evaluation [19]. According to satisfied user criterion (SUC) also specified in [19], a user is regarded as satisfied if 98 % of packets for the user are received successfully within 50 [*]ms air interface delay bound when monitored over the duration of the whole voice call. The VoIP system capacity is further defined as the number of users per cell when more than 95 % of the users in the cell are satisfied.|$|E
30|$|We propose an {{efficient}} control channel resource allocation approach {{to enhance the}} performance of voice-over-IP (VoIP) in orthogonal frequency division multiple access- (OFDMA-) based next generation mobile communication systems. As the long-term evolution (LTE) of universal terrestrial radio access network (UTRAN), evolved UTRAN (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> is the first OFDMA-based packet radio network and thus selected in this paper as an application example. Our proposed physical downlink control channel (PDCCH) resource allocation approach for <b>E-UTRAN</b> is composed of bidirectional power control, inner loop link adaptation (ILLA), and outer loop link adaptation (OLLA) algorithms. Its effectiveness is validated through large-scale radio system level simulations, and simulation results confirm that VoIP capacity with dynamic scheduling can be further enhanced with this PDCCH resource allocation approach. Moreover, the VoIP performance requirements for international mobile telecommunications-advanced (IMT-Advanced) radio interface technologies can be met with dynamic scheduling together with proposed PDCCH resource allocation. Besides <b>E-UTRAN,</b> this approach can be introduced to other OFDMA-based mobile communication systems for VoIP performance enhancement as well.|$|E
40|$|The future {{broadband}} wireless cellular systems evolved UTRAN (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> and WiMAX are receiving {{a lot of}} interest in recent years. Both systems deploy orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) physical layer consisting of large number of mutually orthogonal sub-carriers. This physical layer provides high robustness against multi-path effects, high flexibility in allocation of the physical resources, high bandwidth scalability and relatively easy combination with Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) transmission and reception. In this study we investigate several algorithms for allocation of the downlink resources for <b>E-UTRAN</b> and WiMAX cellular systems. The goal of the study is to see the differences in downlink sector and user throughput, and user throughput versus distance from the reference base station for the resource allocation algorithms: reuse-one, reuse-three, soft re-use, reuse partitioning, proportional fair and maximum C/I. Additionally, we observe the difference in performance between <b>E-UTRAN</b> and WiMAX under the conditions selected in this study. The evaluations are done via MATLAB simulations of a cellular system with one central three-sectored site surrounded with two tiers of interfering three-sector sites...|$|E
30|$|Access {{networks}} {{consist of}} the following wireless networks: (1) GERAN of 2 G, (2) UTRAN of 3 G, (3) <b>E-UTRAN</b> of LTE, (4) Trusted non- 3 GPP access networks, typically is WiMAX, (5) Untrusted non- 3 GPP access networks, typically is WLAN.|$|E
30|$|In LTE-A networks, the evolved UMTS {{terrestrial}} radio network (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> consists of eNBs {{with a similar}} role {{as that of the}} base station (BS) in GSM but with additional functionalities [41, 48]. The <b>E-UTRAN</b> handles communication between the UE and the EPC, whereas an eNB handles a UE in one or more cells. The serving eNB (SeNB) is the eNB which currently provides services to a UE. Moreover, the eNB controls low-level operations such as handover functions. The eNB communicates with the core network through the S 1 interface. Several eNBs are also inter-connected with each other through the X 2 interface (see Fig. 5, right) which is mainly used for exchanging information such as packet forwarding during handover. The S 1 interface between an eNB and EPC can also perform handover functions at the cost of more delay. The S 1 and X 2 interfaces operate using an IP-based transport network. Moreover, <b>E-UTRAN</b> also provides home eNB (HeNB) services. HeNB is an eNB which is particularly dedicated to a user within a home for femtocell coverage. It can be connected either directly to the EPC {{in the same way as}} a standard eNB is connected or using some intermediate terminals such as gateways that forward information from multiple eNBs.|$|E
30|$|Home evolved Node B (HeNB), {{which is}} a {{femtocell}} base station, and expanded evolved UMTS terrestrial radio access network (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> architecture are defined to support femtocells in the LTE-Advanced system[8]. HeNB includes most functionalities of eNB and is connected to cellular core networks through the existing Internet access and HeNB gateway.|$|E
30|$|This {{article focuses}} on VoLTE {{end-to-end}} delay in a heterogeneous wireless communication scenario when a VoLTE call initiated in the <b>E-UTRAN</b> and then handed over to a legacy GERAN/UTRAN radio area. A VoLTE inter-RAT handover mechanism is presented that enables voice and data sessions continuity between these different radio access technologies based on the 3 GPP standardization.|$|E
30|$|In a {{realistic}} LTE-Advanced scenario, the network will combine multiple radio access technologies (RATs), frequencies and cell sizes for efficient deployment [35] and the UEs carry out parameter measurement for multi-RAT intra-/interfrequency mobility. For elaboration simplicity, we consider interfrequency <b>E-UTRAN</b> HO {{process in the}} current context, whereas the proposed system with minimal enhancement can also be employed for inter-RAT HO mechanism.|$|E
40|$|It is {{desirable}} that energy performance improvement is not realized {{at the expense}} of other network performance parameters. This paper investigates the trade off between energy efficiency, spectral efficiency and user QoS performance for a multi-cell multi-user radio access network. Specifically, the energy consumption ratio (ECR) and the spectral efficiency of several common frequency domain packet schedulers in a cellular <b>E-UTRAN</b> downlink are compared for both the SISO transmission mode and the 2 x 2 Alamouti Space Frequency Block Code (SFBC) MIMO transmission mode. It is well known that the 2 x 2 SFBC MIMO transmission mode is more spectrally efficient compared to the SISO transmission mode, however, the relationship between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency is undecided. It is shown that, for the <b>E-UTRAN</b> downlink with fixed transmission power, spectral efficiency improvement results into energy efficiency improvement. The effect of SFBC MIMO versus SISO on the user QoS performance is also studied...|$|E
30|$|Since RSRQ {{measurement}} combines {{signal strength}} and interference levels, this parameter is significant in assisting the mobility management in <b>E-UTRAN.</b> Mathematically, as the RSRQ measurement {{is proportional to}} the RSRP and signal strength, the current implementation considers RSRQ as the key measurement parameter along with mobility to implement the AMA mechanism. This optimizes and provides a fast, simplified and efficient aggregation and reporting mechanism.|$|E
30|$|A HeNB {{contains}} all the entities of the <b>E-UTRAN</b> protocol stack (i.e., RRC, MAC, and PHY) which implementations differ {{with respect to}} the eNB. In particular, at RRC and MAC layers, enhanced features have been added, e.g., a new handover procedure more suitable for heterogeneous environments and the possibility to configure the HeNB in both closed and restricted access modes (see Section 3.3 for details).|$|E
30|$|Since {{the future}} mobile {{communication}} systems also target for {{high data rate}} transmission, it is preferable to allocate more radio resources for data transmission, thus leaving few resources for control signaling. Therefore, deploying VoIP in OFDMA-based packet radio systems encounters one unique challenge, that is, to satisfy high VoIP capacity demand with only limited physical layer control signaling resources. In <b>E-UTRAN,</b> PDCCH carries scheduling grants for both downlink and uplink, and its overall design was addressed in [6]. During the <b>E-UTRAN</b> standardization in Third Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP), different solutions and schemes [7 – 11] have already been studied to overcome the limitations of PDCCH resources on VoIP capacity. All these aim at reducing the consumption of PDCCH resources {{and the possibility of}} conducting effective PDCCH resource allocation is not considered. The existing UTRAN LTE system level simulation results [9, 12] using simplified PDCCH modeling show that VoIP capacity with dynamic scheduling is limited by available PDCCH resources. The studies [13, 14] using realistic PDCCH modeling further confirm such limiting effect. Compared with delay-tolerant full buffer traffic, the impact of PDCCH limitation on delay-sensitive VoIP traffic is much more severe. While PDCCH limitation causes only marginal loss of cell throughput with full buffer traffic and there is also no evident relationship between cell throughput and the number of users scheduled per TTI [15], VoIP capacity in <b>E-UTRAN</b> is directly proportional to the number of users scheduled simultaneously in each TTI [13, 14]. On the other hand, it also implies great potential to significantly enhance VoIP capacity if effective PDCCH resource allocation is in place. However, the related study is obviously missing in available open literature.|$|E
30|$|LTE is {{implemented}} on EPC. The transition to LTE/System Architecture Evolution (SAE) involves {{a fundamental shift}} to a “flat” all-IP system architecture that impacts {{every part of the}} network, with the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) at its centre. SAE specifies an all-IP network architecture designed to support end-to-end packet services. It comprises two tightly integrated components: the Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> - a.k.a. LTE RAN - and EPC.|$|E

40|$|Third-Generation Partnership Project (3 GPP) standardizes an Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> as air {{interface}} in its release 8 LTE. Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) and Single Carrier-Frequency Division Multiple Access(SC-FDMA) are key technologies for the {{air interface}} of mobile broadband systems. It is evident that mobile broadband access technologies are reaching a commonality in the air interface and networking architecture; they are being converged to an IP-based network architecture with OFDMA based air interface technology. The air interface of <b>E-UTRAN</b> is based on OFDMA in downlink and SC-FDMA in the uplink, {{making it possible to}} efficiently utilize bandwidth due to the orthogonally between sub-carriers and by assigning subsets of sub-carriers to individual users which allows for simultaneous data rate transmission from several users and differentiated quality of service for each user. In this paper, wehighlight the technologies behindOFDMA and SC-FDMA and also carry out performance comparison of the two air interface technologies. We brieflydescribe the 3 GPP LTE standard, and its implementation using OFDMA and SC-FDMA technology. </p...|$|E
30|$|The rest of {{the article}} is {{organized}} as follows. Section 2 discusses related works. Sections 3 and 4 provide details of the model design and implementation. Section 5 gives a numerical example to illustrate the model operation. Section 6 debates the model results and compares them with reported KPIs. The same modeling techniques used in 3 G/UTRAN can be extended to include 4 G/LTE (<b>E-UTRAN),</b> as {{will be discussed in}} Section 7. Finally, concluding remarks and future work are presented in Section 8.|$|E
30|$|The {{measurement}} of DMRs, TNs and IMU will be forwarded as per pre-configured interval to the measurement engine module of OPU. This module implements an AMA mechanism {{based on the}} speed of train. Priority toward DMR measurement will be given at a time wherein the train is stationary or at lower speed. When the train attains moderate or higher speeds, AMA mechanism will give preference to readings from TNs, thereby facilitating an early reporting mechanism. This will provide <b>E-UTRAN</b> and EPC with sufficient lead time in completing the HO procedures.|$|E
30|$|<b>E-UTRAN</b> {{has been}} {{standardized}} by 3 GPP {{to be highly}} scalable and flexible RAT. It supports a range of bandwidths, from 1.4 to 20  MHz. 3 GPP Release 10 (R 10) LTE-Advanced (LTE-A) can provide up to 100  MHz bandwidth support through Carrier Aggregation (CA). LTE-A extends LTE bandwidth by aggregating up to 5 20  MHz channels, which results in higher data rate and system capacity. LTE-based wireless networks employ Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) in the DL and Single-Carrier Frequency-Division Multiple Access (SC-FDMA) in the UL.|$|E
30|$|E-HWMP is {{standard}} for wireless access to vehicular environments (WAVE) that employs a vehicular connection in vehicles (V 2 V). A Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V 2 I) connection is {{not supported by}} the standard for wireless access. The Evolved Universal Terrestrial Radio Access Network (<b>E-UTRAN)</b> interface is utilized by the VANET to connect to the internet through eNodeB. Gateway numbers are required to be lower. The proposed scheme is cluster based. The clusters are formulated only at a certain point of the 3 GPP LTE cell’s edges when the received signal strength (RSS) crumbles to less than assured threshold.|$|E
30|$|Current UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN), {{commonly}} referred to as 3 G (3 rd Generation Wireless Mobile Communication Technology), is the incumbent mobile technology in Europe. The authors have studied real 3 G network scenarios in Spain, where, at the moment, Long-Term Evolution (LTE)/ 4 G (<b>e-UTRAN)</b> clusters are being deployed, but only in trial scenarios. So, not enough network KPIs are being collected in order to extend the dimensioning model to LTE. We have intentionally based our work on currently deployed 3 G networks, where we have plenty of field experience to calibrate the model. We also propose how to extend this approach to future LTE-based networks.|$|E
