50|$|This family {{consists}} of many varieties of instrument configurations. Most readily identified are American harp guitars with either <b>hollow</b> <b>arms,</b> double necks or harp-like frames for supporting extra bass strings, and European bass guitars (or contraguitars). Other harp guitars feature treble or mid-range floating strings, or various combinations of multiple floating string banks {{along with a}} standard guitar neck.|$|R
40|$|The Personnel Occupied Woven Envelope Robot (POWER) {{provides}} {{an alternative to}} extravehicular activity (EVA) of space suited astronauts and/or use of long slender manipulator arms such as {{are used in the}} Shuttle Remote Manipulator System. POWER provides the capability for a shirt sleeved astronaut to perform such work by entering a control pod through air locks at both ends of an inflated flexible bellows (access tunnel). The exoskeleton of the tunnel is a series of six degrees of freedom (Six-DOF) articulated links compressible to 1 / 6 of their fully extended length. The operator can maneuver the control pod to almost any location within about 50 m of the base attachment to the space station. POWER can be envisioned as a series of hollow Six-DOF manipulator segments or arms wherein each arm grasps the shoulder of the next <b>arm.</b> Inside the <b>hollow</b> <b>arms</b> ia a bellow-type access tunnel. The control pod is the fist of the series of linked <b>hollow</b> <b>arms.</b> The fingers of the fist are conventional manipulator arms under direct visual control of the nearby operator in the pod. The applications and progress to date of the POWER system is given...|$|R

6000|$|I {{was waiting}} for him--And, oh joy! it was the [...] "Repeater" [...] himself, smugly complacent with {{knowledge}} of past success. I dropped the rifle negligently across the <b>hollow</b> of my <b>arm</b> {{and went down to}} him.|$|R
60|$|The {{crowd had}} eyes for naught but Akoon, and the rifle of Porportuk’s man lay across the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm,</b> the muzzle {{directed}} at Akoon a yard away, the man’s thumb on the hammer. But Akoon did nothing.|$|R

60|$|His {{weapon was}} thrown across the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm</b> {{as he stood}} looking at me in a {{friendly}} manner, and I might easily have shot him down, unless he was quicker with a rifle than any other I had ever met.|$|R
60|$|Between us {{we picked}} them up and {{replaced}} them in the broken bag, which he now held carefully in the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm.</b> I tried to tell him my gladness at meeting him and that he must come right home with me.|$|R

60|$|Young Jerry {{broke off}} his song {{at the sound}} of {{approaching}} footsteps, A tall, blue-shirted man, a rifle across the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm,</b> came out from the gloom of the pine-trees.

60|$|The hunter nodded, and, {{throwing}} his rifle in the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm,</b> proceeded down the hill. Joe followed closely, endeavoring, as Wetzel had trained him, {{to make each}} step precisely in the hunter's footprints. The lad had soon learned to step nimbly and softly as a cat. When half way down the bill Wetzel paused.|$|R
6000|$|The girl, {{from her}} {{position}} a little above him, surveyed with still eyes the abstracted {{silence of the}} man on whom she now depended with a completeness of which {{she had not been}} vividly conscious before, because, till then, she had never felt herself swinging between the abysses of earth and heaven in the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm.</b> What if he should grow weary of the burden? ...|$|R
60|$|Elksfoot {{left the}} spot the first. After {{completing}} his adieus, the Pottawattamie threw his rifle into the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm,</b> felt at his belt, {{as if to}} settle it into its place, made some little disposition of his light summer covering, and moved off in a southwesterly direction, passing through the open glades, and almost equally unobstructed groves, as steady in his movements as if led by an instinct.|$|R
50|$|Buell led {{the company}} to create {{some of the most}} innovative, usable sport bikes to date under the XB series of Buell Motorcycles. Using inventions like a twin spar hollow {{aluminum}} frame to house the fuel and create chassis rigidity, a <b>hollow</b> swing <b>arm</b> to house the oil, and an underslung exhaust pipe, he was able to keep the center of gravity low for optimum handling. During this time, still using the 45 degree V-twin Harley-Davidson engine design, albeit re-worked to produce 30% more horsepower than the standard HD Sportster engine. For the 2008 model year, Buell introduced a new water cooled, 1125cc, 72 degree V-twin engine developed in cooperation with Rotax for the Buell 1125R and 1125CR(2009) producing 146 bhp.|$|R
60|$|With {{the long}} rifle in the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm</b> Jack forgot {{that he was}} a sick man. When he came within gunshot of the flock the smell of sheep effectually smothered the keen, tasty odor of black sage and juniper. Sheep ranged {{everywhere}} under the low cedars. They browsed with noses in the frost, and from all around came the tinkle of tiny bells on the curly-horned rams, and an endless variety of bleats.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Tis {{well you}} {{understood}} the knave!" [...] whispered the scout, {{when they had}} gained a little distance from the place, and letting his rifle fall into the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm</b> again; [...] "I soon {{saw that he was}} one of them uneasy Frenchers; and well for him it was that his speech was friendly and his wishes kind, or a place might have been found for his bones among those of his countrymen." ...|$|R
6000|$|When he saw {{his little}} band collected, the scout threw [...] "Killdeer" [...] into the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm,</b> and making a silent signal {{that he would be}} followed, he led them many rods towards the rear, into the bed of a little brook which they had crossed in advancing. Here he halted; and after waiting for the whole of his grave and {{attentive}} warriors to close about him, he spoke in Delaware, demanding-- ...|$|R
60|$|Manak Chand, {{the general}} {{commanding}} the nabob's forces, informed by spies of {{the movements of}} the English troops, moved out with fifteen hundred horses and two thousand foot. So worn out were the British upon their arrival at the dried bed of the lake that, after detaching a small body to occupy a village near the enemy's fort, from which alone danger was expected; while another took up the post in some jungles, {{by the side of the}} main road, the rest threw themselves down to sleep. Some lay in the village, some in the shade of the bushes along the sides of the <b>hollow.</b> Their <b>arms</b> were all piled in a heap, sixty yards from the eastern bank. The two field pieces stood deserted, on the north side of the village. Not a single sentry was posted.|$|R
60|$|Without deigning {{to bestow}} further words, or {{to wait for}} any answer, the savage cast his rifle into the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm,</b> and moved silently through the encampment towards the woods where his own tribe was known to lie. Every few yards as he {{proceeded}} he was challenged by the sentinels; but he stalked sullenly onward, utterly disregarding the summons of the soldiers, who only spared his life because they knew the air and tread {{no less than the}} obstinate daring of an Indian.|$|R
60|$|Miss Hartley {{handed them}} over at once, and, walking by his side, strove hard to repress {{malicious}} smiles. She walked slowly and gave appraising glances at shop windows, pausing finally at a greengrocer’s to purchase some bananas. Mr. Vyner, with the buns {{held in the}} <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm,</b> watched her anxiously, and his face fell as she agreed with the greengrocer as to the pity of spoiling a noble bunch he was displaying. Insufficiently draped in a brown-paper bag, it took Mr. Vyner’s other arm.|$|R
50|$|Magic Motorcycle, a small USA {{component}} manufacturer {{that was later}} purchased by Cannondale, and re-formed into Cannondale's CODA brand (Coda Magic 900 cranks), made a proprietary external bearing bottom bracket, oversized spindle and crank system in the early 1990s. This design {{is similar to the}} external Bottom Bracket designs that are currently being marketed by FSA, RaceFace and Shimano. The modern versions are using the same bearing size (6805-RS) and even the original mounting tool fits but the bearings are sitting closer to the frame now. The crank had intricately CNC machined wide <b>hollow</b> crank <b>arms</b> made of two halves glued together. However, Cannondale moved on and developed the SI cranks and the new BB30 bottom bracket standard. Their special frames have a larger bottom bracket shell allowing the bearings to be inside again while their top level SI crankarms are still two machined aluminum halves glued together.|$|R
6000|$|The borderer {{instantly}} complied, muttering {{between his}} teeth as he shook the priming deeper into the barrel of his piece, [...] "Your over-sea gallants are quick on the trail to-night!" [...] Then throwing the musket into the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm,</b> he cast a look of discontent and resentment towards Faith Ring, {{and was about to}} open the door for the passage of Content, when another blast arose on the silence without. The second touch, of the shell was firmer, longer, louder, and more true, than that by which it had just been preceded.|$|R
60|$|A {{rustling}} {{in the low}} bushes {{which still}} grew, for some distance, along the swale that formed the thicket on which the camp of Ishmael had rested, caught his ear, at the moment, and cut short the soliloquy. The habits of so many years, spent in the wilderness, caused the old man to bring his rifle to a poise, with something like the activity and promptitude of his youth; but, suddenly recovering his recollection, he dropped it into the <b>hollow</b> of his <b>arm</b> again, and resumed his air of melancholy resignation.|$|R
50|$|Lysurus cruciatus is {{a species}} of fungus in the stinkhorn family. It was first {{described}} scientifically in 1845 by French botanists François Mathias René Leprieur and Camille Montagne as Aserophallus cruciatus. German mycologist Paul Christoph Hennings transferred it to the genus Lysurus in 1902. Its fruit bodies feature a white, cylindrical tube supporting a cluster of <b>hollow,</b> reddish pointed <b>arms</b> whose surface is covered with foul-smelling spore mass, or gleba. The gleba is brownish to greenish in color, and contains spores with dimensions of 3-4 by 1.5-2 µm.|$|R
50|$|Thévenet caught Merckx, by {{now almost}} delirious, 3km from the finish and rode by. The {{pictures}} show Merckx's face torn with anguish, eyes <b>hollow,</b> body slumped, <b>arms</b> locked shut on the bars, shoulders a clenched ridge of exertion and distress. Thévenet, mouth gaping to gulp more oxygen, looks pretty {{well at the}} limit, too, but his effort is gaining; he's out of the saddle, {{eyes fixed on the}} road. He said he could see that one side of the road had turned to liquid tar in the baking heat and Merckx was tyre-deep in it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then do not go. Sit {{by my side}} here--so. Mother, {{the lord}} of this house needs a cushion. Bring it.' There was an almost {{imperceptible}} movement {{on the part of}} the new life that lay in the <b>hollow</b> of Ameera's <b>arm.</b> 'Aho!' she said, her voice breaking with love. 'The babe is a champion from his birth. He is kicking me in the side with mighty kicks. Was there ever such a babe! And he is ours to us--thine and mine. Put thy hand on his head, but carefully, for he is very young, and men are unskilled in such matters.' ...|$|R
