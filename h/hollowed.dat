40|$|Log <b>hollows</b> provide {{important}} habitat {{for a range}} of vertebrate fauna. Despite this, {{little is known about the}} impact fire regimes have on this resource, or the role topography may play in preserving <b>hollows</b> through the mitigation of fire intensity. This study examined the effect different combinations of fire frequency and topography have on (i) the number of <b>hollow</b> bearing logs and (ii) the presence and size of <b>hollows</b> within logs. The influence of wildfire severity and logging were also examined. <b>Hollow</b> availability (i. e. density of <b>hollow</b> bearing logs and <b>hollow</b> presence within logs) was greatest at sites burnt at ‘low’ frequency. The density of <b>hollow</b> logs was greater in gullies, though the effect of fire frequency did not vary with topographic position. <b>Hollows</b> showing signs of internal fire charring typically had a greater entrance width than unburnt <b>hollows,</b> which suggests fire plays an important role in creating large <b>hollows.</b> The number of <b>hollow</b> bearing logs increased with logging intensity, due to unmerchantable timber being left in situ. Wildfire severity had little effect on log <b>hollows.</b> The results indicate that frequent burning may reduce <b>hollow</b> availability, though it is likely that gullies will still retain a high density of <b>hollow</b> bearing logs irrespective of burning, and may play an important role in preserving connectivity of this resource across landscapes...|$|R

5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily <b>hollowed</b> out in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E

5|$|The males sing {{throughout}} much of the construction and even more so when a female approaches his nest. Following copulation, the male and female continue to build the nest. Nests may be in any type of hole, common locations include inside <b>hollowed</b> trees, buildings, tree stumps and man-made nest-boxes. S. v. zetlandicus typically breeds in crevices and holes in cliffs, a habitat only rarely used by the nominate form. Nests are typically made out of straw, dry grass and twigs with an inner lining made up of feathers, wool and soft leaves. Construction usually takes four or five days and may continue through incubation.|$|E
5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage matted {{together to form a}} bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a <b>hollowed</b> out tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E

5|$|The Antankarana were {{historically}} {{fishermen and}} pastoralist zebu herders, although {{in recent years}} most have become agriculturalists. Sea fishing is carried out in two-man canoes made from a single <b>hollowed</b> out log. Antankarana fishermen used these canoes to hunt whales, turtles and fish. They also used nets to hunt in rivers, where they could catch eels, fish, crayfish and other food sources. Salt production was historically a major economic activity. Historically the Antankarana engaged in trading with European seafarers, exchanging tortoiseshell for guns. Today, {{while the majority of}} Antankarana continue to work in these traditional sectors – especially the highly lucrative shrimp fishing business or the growing of sugarcane – many are wage laborers. More highly educated community members, particularly among the noble class, work in salaried positions as government officials, teachers {{and a variety of other}} trades and professions. The SIRAMA national sugar company factories are located in Antankarana territory and employ many migrants, but relatively few Antankarana as their standard of living on average is high enough to be able to pursue better opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The layers {{are then}} left to dry under the sun, {{after which the}} entire mold is heated in a furnace to melt away the wax and {{hardening}} the coal/mud mixture, leaving behind a <b>hollowed</b> shell. With this hardened mold, molten bronze is poured down the mold’s mouth cavity, cooled to a certain degree, then the coal/mud is broken apart, revealing a new gong. The gong is then refined, cleaned, and properly identified by the blacksmith (pandáy). Finally, the gongs are refined using the tongkol process, tuning these either by hammering the boss from the inside to slightly raise its pitch, or by hammering the boss from the outside to lower the pitch. The correct tuning is found by ear, with players striking a sequence of gongs, looking for a melodic contour they are familiar with.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{destructive}} effects of gunpowder were {{described in the}} earlier Tang dynasty by a Daoist alchemist, the earliest-known existent written formulas for gunpowder come from the Wujing Zongyao text of 1044, which described explosive bombs hurled from catapults. The earliest developments of the gun barrel and the projectile-fire cannon were found in late Song China. The first art depiction of the Chinese 'fire lance' (a combination of a temporary-fire flamethrower and gun) was from a Buddhist mural painting of Dunhuang, dated circa 950. These 'fire-lances' were widespread in use by the early 12th century, featuring <b>hollowed</b> bamboo poles as tubes to fire sand particles (to blind and choke), lead pellets, bits of sharp metal and pottery shards, and finally large gunpowder-propelled arrows and rocket weaponry. Eventually, perishable bamboo was replaced with hollow tubes of cast iron, and so too did the terminology of this new weapon change, from 'fire-spear' ('huo qiang') to 'fire-tube' ('huo tong'). This ancestor to the gun was complemented by the ancestor to the cannon, what the Chinese referred to since the 13th century as the 'multiple bullets magazine erupter' ('bai zu lian zhu pao'), a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls. In 1132, at the Siege of De'an, Song Chinese forces used fire lances against the rival Jurchen-led Jin dynasty.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Natural Resources: Wildlife, 2008 Roosting {{habitat is}} one of the most {{essential}} habitat components to consider for conservation of bat populations. Basal <b>hollows</b> found almost exclusively in old growth redwood trees provide a distinct roost type that has been recognized as a widely used resource by bats in the redwood region. With the estimated removal of more than 95 percent of old growth redwood trees, the distribution of these roost types has become increasingly limited. One possible outcome of lowered roost densities is a concentration of bats in basal <b>hollows</b> more geographically isolated from others. This study examined the effect of <b>hollow</b> isolation on forest-dwelling bat populations in Del Norte County in northern California. I compared the frequency and intensity of bat use of basal <b>hollows</b> within three <b>hollow</b> isolation categories: (1) contiguous forest stands with low <b>hollow</b> isolation levels; (2) small remnant forest stands with moderate <b>hollow</b> isolation levels; and (3) second and third growth commercial forest stands with high <b>hollow</b> isolation levels. Using monthly bat guano samples as an index of use, I found no evidence for increased use of the most isolated <b>hollows.</b> To the contrary, bats appeared to use less isolated <b>hollows</b> with greater frequency and equal intensity to those <b>hollows</b> in areas with higher isolation levels. <b>Hollow</b> internal volume, overhead volume relative to the <b>hollow</b> opening, and proximity to water were important variables in predicting which <b>hollows</b> would be used most. My results fail to support past findings in the same region that showed greater use by bats of basal <b>hollows</b> in isolated remnant forest patches than those <b>hollows</b> found in contiguous forested regions. Future studies should look at species composition of bats roosting within basal <b>hollows,</b> <b>hollow</b> temperatures, and available foraging resources for increased understanding of bats in redwood forests and those factors that influence roost selection.

5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably <b>hollowed</b> out by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E
