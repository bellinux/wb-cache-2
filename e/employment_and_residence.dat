40|$|The {{assumption}} thaturban workers economize on commuting {{is implicit}} in urban economic theory. Yet it has been challenged by some recent studies. This study estimates commute flows implied by three urban density functions: monocentric, polycentric, and dispersive. A polycentric density function generalizes the standard monocentric model by assuming that <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> worker <b>residences</b> are distributed in a pattern consistent with several employment centres, not just one. A dispersive density function further generalizes the polycentric model by assuming that urban residents not only value access to employment centres but also value access to the overall job opportunities in their location choices. It is found that an urban density function better predicting the actual spatial patterns also better explains the actual commuting behaviour. This finding helps to preserve the assumption that urban workers make attempts to economize on commuting in their location choices. ...|$|R

Using disaggregated data on land prices, workplace <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> employment for thousands of city blocks for 1936, 1986 and 2006, we find that the model can account both qualitatively and quantitatively for the observed changes in city structure...|$|E

This trend occurs in spite of the absence of an urban wage premium for university-educated workers and the concentration of congestion there. We find that power couples locate more often in medium sized and larger cities than otherwise comparable households and that they are relatively often owner-occupiers and live in more expensive housing. Their commutes are relatively short when it is taken into account that it is more difficult for these households to find suitable combinations of <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> locations than it is for single earner households. A probable explanation for these findings is that power couples use their relatively large purchasing power to outbid other households from locations that are especially attractive t! o them, as is predicted by household location theory...|$|E

Estimates of the wage differential between self-employment and paid-employment obtained through a three-stage methodology using the 2002 China Household Income Project (CHIP), reveal that rural migrants become self-employed to avoid low-pay city jobs, enhancing their odds of economic assimilation. Conversely, urban residents become entrepreneurs {{to move out of}} unemployment. The empirical analysis confirms that self-employment also attracts married individuals and those in good health, while it negatively relates to high educational attainment. The decomposition of hourly wage differences between pairs (by type of <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> status) shows that higher hourly wages of paid and self-employed urbanites over migrants predominantly arise through {{differences in}} coefficients (i. e.

I further show that this trend is especially pronounced among black males and that the status characteristics of these marriages have remained traditional in the sense that intermarriage still occurs primarily when the white woman marries up in socioeconomic status. In my conclusion, I offer several interpretations of why the link between status and interracial marriage persists, and discuss what this implies for the nature of racial differentiation in contemporary American society...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} the results of the analysis of levels, patterns and trends in the incidence of poverty in Zambia between 1991 and 1998, based on data captured in nationally representative surveys. In 1998, about 73 per cent of the households in Zambia were poor, the majority of which were extremely poor. Most poor households were in rural areas, with wide inter- and intra-provincial and district variations. The incidence of poverty also varied according to <b>employment</b> status <b>and</b> sector, as well as by district, gender, marital status, education and stratum of head of the household. In general, households headed by females, those without any formal education, unpaid family workers, the inactive, the self-employed, and those in agriculture, forestry and fishing recorded the highest incidence of poverty, with those employed in private households being affected the worst. In spite of the general increase in poverty nationally, most rural provinces registered declines while urban areas experienced increases in the incidence of poverty during the period under review. Furthermore, except for the agricultural/forestry, mining and quarrying, and electricity and gas sectors, the incidence of poverty increased in all the other sectors while remaining almost the same in the real estate sector. The direction and magnitude in the incidence of poverty between 1991 and 1998 were also associated with gender, education, employment status, <b>employment</b> sector, <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> of head of the household, as well as size of the household. Based on the analysis, the article strongly recommends revision in the measurement of poverty, investigation of the types of coping strategies adopted by the poor, {{and the extent to which}} these impact on the general well-being and productivity of vulnerable households in Zambia.

40|$|This book {{is about}} the novel and often {{experimental}} ways West African migrants in the Netherlands use kinship {{in their quest for}} international mobility, <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> legal <b>residence.</b> In the social sciences, there has been a general tendency to assume that the emergence and growing influence of the state will restrict the societal role of kinship and its entanglement with politics and other domains of social life. This study shows that it is precisely the evermore intensive interventions by the state – notably new measures to control mobility across borders, access to the labor market and citizenship – that trigger new efforts by migrants to mobilize and develop kinship in order to use it for creating footholds in new surroundings. A focus on kinship, a classical anthropological topic, turned out to be surprisingly relevant for understanding migrant struggles to retain agency in the face of mounting external pressures. Yet, this new context can also inspire a critical appraisal of the basic tenets of older approaches to kinship. Close attention to kinship’s dynamics and flexibility is imperative. But even more important is the attention to inequality as a complement to the usual tendency to pair kinship with reciprocity. Instead of seeking a normative answer to what kinship is, this book examines what kinship enables and how it does so. The emphasis on the practices of kinship relativizes its glossy cover of reciprocity and solidarity, shedding light on its dark side, which is often neglected in formal statements by both migrants and kinship scholars...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to examine the implications of modelling urban systems at the micro and macro levels. The methodological aspects of, and the results from, two models will be considered, namely the MASTER (Micro-Analytical Simulation of Transport, <b>Employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>Residence)</b> model and the LILT (the Leeds Integrated Land-use Transport) model. The MASTER model simulates demographic change, decisions about moving home and changing job, and decisions about transport, such as car ownership, and modal choice for a set of households and their members. The nature of the model permits the analysis of the relationships between household dynamics, car ownership, car availability, and modal choice. The model can identify latent demand for homes and employment, so that the implications of increasing the supply of dwellings and jobs for travel demand, can be traced through these relationships. LILT is an aggregate land-use transport model that was originally based on the Lowry model, but now includes travel demand, plus various other extensions. The models have been applied to the same study-area over the same time-period, so the implications of testing a variety of policies with the two models can be discussed. The focus of this paper is both on the methodological issues and the practical implications of the two approaches, as well as the comparable results from the two models. ...|$|E
40|$|Trade has {{an impact}} on the spatial pattern of production, <b>employment</b> <b>and</b> <b>residence</b> in countries, which can be altered by changes to policy. This Working Paper {{explains}} the ways in which trade policy and rural– urban balance may be linked, and suggests areas in which further enquiry may be particularly fruitful. Trade theory identifies the factors that endow a country with a comparative advantage in producing types of goods that are likely to have distinct spatial associations. The new economic geography addresses more directly the causes and consequences of the spatial distribution of activity. There is some empirical evidence regarding the links between the liberalisation of a country’s trade regime and the rate of urbanisation. It is also possible to identify major changes in trade policy that are likely to have broad impacts on rural–urban balance. Stylised country groups can be identified according {{to the ways in which}} their rural–urban balance will be affected by changes to their partners’ trade policies. There are two priorities for further research into the spatial effects of trade change in specific contexts. One is to identify the countries where imminent trade policy change is most likely to have implications for rural–urban balance, and to select from this group those for which adequate data are available. The other is to measure the extent of geographical mobility and spatial redistribution in a sub-set of these countries. Keywords: urban-rural balance; trade policy; New Economic Geograph...|$|E

40|$|Background In {{order to}} meet the Sustainable Development Goal to {{decrease}} maternal mortality, increased access to obstetric interventions such as Caesarean sections (CS) is of critical importance. As a result of women's limited access to routine and emergency obstetric services in Nigeria, the country is a major contributor to the global burden of maternal mortality. In this analysis, we aim to establish rates of CS and determine socioeconomic or medical risk factors associated with having a CS in Enugu, southeast Nigeria. Methods Data for this study originated from the Healthy Beginning Initiative study. Participant characteristics were obtained from 2300 women at baseline via a semi-structured questionnaire. Only {{women between the ages of}} 17 - 45 who had singleton deliveries were retained for this analysis. Post-delivery questionnaires were used to ascertain mode-of-delivery. Crude and adjusted logistic regressions with Caesarean as the main outcome are presented. Results In this sample, 7. 22 % women had a CS. Compared to women who lived in an urban setting, those who lived in a rural setting had a significant reduction in the odds of having a CS (aOR: 0. 58; 0. 38 - 0. 89). Significantly higher odds of having a CS were seen among those with high peripheral malaria parasitemia compared to those with low parasitemia (aOR: 1. 54; 1. 04 - 2. 28).
