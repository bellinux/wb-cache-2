25|$|Theoria: Ruskin's 'theoretic' faculty – theoretic, {{as opposed}} to {{aesthetic}} – enables {{a vision of the}} beautiful as intimating a reality deeper than the everyday, {{at least in terms of}} the kind of transcendence generally seen as immanent in things of this world. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the influence of Ruskin's concept of theoria, see Peter Fuller.|$|E

25|$|Semantic {{networks}} see {{the most}} use in models of discourse and logical comprehension, {{as well as}} in Artificial Intelligence. In these models, the nodes correspond to words or word stems and the links represent syntactic relations between them. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a computational implementation of semantic networks in knowledge representation, see Cravo and Martins (1993).|$|E
25|$|Two object suffixes {{are only}} allowed {{if the first}} (the DO) is 3rd person. In such cases the DO reduces to {{the form of the}} attributive suffix: -e (m.sg. / f.pl.) or -i (f.sg. / m.pl.); only context tells which {{combination}} of number and gender is intended. 3rd-singular direct objects also reduce to this form in the imperative singular; 3rd-plural change their vowels but do not conflate with the singular: see 'dead zebra' under nouns above <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the forms.|$|E
25|$|Elliptic {{geometry}} is {{also like}} Euclidean geometry in that space is continuous, homogeneous, isotropic, and without boundaries. Isotropy is {{guaranteed by the}} fourth postulate, that all right angles are equal. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> homogeneity, note that Euclid's proposition I.1 implies that the same equilateral triangle can be constructed at any location, not just in locations that are special in some way. The lack of boundaries follows from the second postulate, extensibility of a line segment.|$|E

25|$|In {{queen and}} pawn endings, passed pawns have {{paramount}} importance, because the queen can escort {{it to the}} queening square alone. The advancement of the passed pawn outweighs the number of pawns. The defender must resort to perpetual check. These endings are frequently extremely long affairs. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a queen and pawn endgame see Kasparov versus the World – Kasparov won although he had fewer pawns because his was more advanced. For the ending with a queen versus a pawn, see Queen versus pawn endgame.|$|E
25|$|Profiles {{like these}} are found for almost all {{proteins}} listed in Wikipedia.

Additional information can be found by searching their databases (<b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the GLUT4 transporter pictured here, see citation). These profiles indicate the level of DNA expression (and hence RNA produced) of a certain protein in a certain tissue, and are color-coded accordingly in the images located in the Protein Box {{on the right side of}} each Wikipedia page.|$|E

A study found that killers of whites {{were more likely to be}} sentenced to death than were killers of blacks. The Court found that the defense had failed to prove that such data {{demonstrated}} the requisite discriminatory intent by the Georgia legislature and executive branch.|$|E

25|$|The {{force of}} {{friction}} is always exerted {{in a direction}} that opposes movement (for kinetic friction) or potential movement (for static friction) between the two surfaces. For example, a curling stone sliding along the ice experiences a kinetic force slowing it down. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> potential movement, the drive wheels of an accelerating car experience a frictional force pointing forward; if they did not, the wheels would spin, and the rubber would slide backwards along the pavement. Note {{that it is not the}} direction of movement of the vehicle they oppose, it is the direction of (potential) sliding between tire and road.|$|E
25|$|Dozens of {{petitions}} {{for freedom}} were filled {{on the basis}} that the petitioner was descended from a free woman, and so, by law, was entitled to freedom. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> a freedom suit based upon the free status of a mother, see John Davis v. Hezekiah Wood, the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia. In another case filed soon after the United States completed the Louisiana Purchase, Marguerite Scypion and her sisters petitioned in 1805 in Saint Louis, Missouri for freedom from slavery for them and their children based on descent from a Native American grandmother.|$|E
25|$|A verse {{narrative}}, as {{one might}} expect, is simply a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. What is interesting about this subgenre is that owing to {{its place in the}} flexible category of long poem, the verse-narrative may have disrupted convention by telling its story in both poem and narrative. This combination broadens the scope of both genres, lending the poem's depth that may be lacking in the other subgenres, yet also a lyrical voice that defines it as poetry. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this, one might turn to Gilgamesh, which encompasses both the subgenres Epic and Verse-Narrative.|$|E

25|$|Alternative methods {{exist to}} compute more complex {{integrals}}. Many nonelementary integrals can be expanded in a Taylor series and integrated term by term. Occasionally, the resulting infinite series {{can be summed}} analytically. The method of convolution using Meijer G-functions can also be used, assuming that the integrand can be written {{as a product of}} Meijer G-functions. There are also many less common ways of calculating definite integrals; for instance, Parseval's identity can be used to transform an integral over a rectangular region into an infinite sum. Occasionally, an integral can be evaluated by a trick; <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this, see Gaussian integral.|$|E
25|$|In the Classical period {{there was}} a {{revolution}} in Greek statuary, usually associated {{with the introduction of}} democracy {{and the end of the}} aristocratic culture associated with the kouroi. The Classical period saw changes in the style and function of sculpture. Poses became more naturalistic (see the Charioteer of Delphi <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the transition to more naturalistic sculpture), and the technical skill of Greek sculptors in depicting the human form in a variety of poses greatly increased. From about 500 BC statues began to depict real people. The statues of Harmodius and Aristogeiton set up in Athens to mark the overthrow of the tyranny were said to be the first public monuments to actual people.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} {{table lists}} a few selected values for t-distributions with ν {{degrees of freedom}} {{for a range of}} one-sided or two-sided critical regions. <b>For</b> <b>an</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> how to read this table, take the fourth row, which begins with 4; that means ν, the number of degrees of freedom, is 4 (and if we are dealing, as above, with n values with a fixed sum, n = 5). Take the fifth entry, in the column headed 95% for one-sided (90% for two-sided). The value of that entry is 2.132. Then the probability that T is less than 2.132 is 95% or Pr(−∞ < T < 2.132) = 0.95; this also means that Pr(−2.132 < T < 2.132) = 0.9.|$|E
