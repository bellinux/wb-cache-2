5|$|A plug-in <b>electric</b> vehicle (PEV) is any {{motor vehicle}} {{that can be}} {{recharged}} from an external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels. PEV is a subset of <b>electric</b> vehicles that includes all-electric or battery <b>electric</b> vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and <b>electric</b> vehicle conversions of hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. In China, plug-in <b>electric</b> vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).|$|E
5|$|A plug-in hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicle (PHEV or PHV), {{also known}} as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicle with {{rechargeable}} batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external <b>electric</b> power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicle and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an <b>electric</b> motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E
5|$|An {{aftermarket}} <b>electric</b> vehicle conversion is the {{modification of}} a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) or hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicle (HEV) to <b>electric</b> propulsion, creating an all-electric or plug-in hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicle.|$|E

5|$|PEV is a {{subcategory}} of <b>electric</b> {{vehicles that}} includes battery <b>electric</b> vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and <b>electric</b> vehicle conversions of hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicles and conventional {{internal combustion engine}} vehicles. Even though conventional hybrid <b>electric</b> vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from {{the internal combustion engine}} and regenerative braking, they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle <b>electric</b> energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in <b>electric</b> vehicles.|$|E

This {{is based on the}} assumption that 10% of households would install turbines at costs competitive with grid <b>electric</b> power, around 12 pence (US 19 cents) a kW·h. A report prepared for the UK's government-sponsored Energy Saving Trust in 2006, found that home power generators of various kinds could provide 30 to 40% of the country's <b>electric</b> power needs by 2050.|$|E
