50|$|In 1969, Waldbaum's {{purchased}} Holyoke's Food Mart Inc., {{a privately}} held chain of 14 supermarkets in Connecticut and western Massachusetts with {{annual sales of}} $38 million. These stores' sales quadrupled from 1960 to 1968; in the only down year, 1965, it <b>dropped</b> trading <b>stamps</b> to reduce costs. Waldbaum's introduced a line of private-label foods and nonfood items in 1964; at least two stores had pharmacies. Waldbaum's moved its headquarters and distribution center in 1974, to Central Islip. Almost half of the 118 stores that year were in Brooklyn and Queens. During 1978-1979 the company bought 10 former Pantry Pride/Hills Stores from the bankrupt Food Fair chain, bringing {{the total number of}} outlets to 138, compared with 80 in 1970. Net sales reached $1.1 billion in 1979 (compared with $281 million in 1969), and net income was $7.8 million, compared with $2.7 million in 1969. In 1979, Waldbaum's was the second largest company in sales on Long Island and the third largest employer.|$|R
50|$|A {{few basic}} items of {{equipment}} {{are needed to}} collect stamps. Stamp tongs help to handle stamps safely, a magnifying glass helps in viewing fine details and an album is a convenient way to store stamps. The stamps need to {{be attached to the}} pages of the album in some way and stamp hinges are a cheap and simple way to do this. Hinging stamps can damage them, thus reducing their value; today many collectors prefer more expensive hingeless mounts. Issued in various sizes, these are clear chemically neutral thin plastic holders that open to receive stamps and are gummed on the back so that they stick to album pages. Another alternative is a stockbook where the <b>stamps</b> <b>drop</b> into clear pockets without the need for a mount. Stamps should be stored away from light, heat and moisture or they will be damaged.|$|R
5|$|The {{state of}} the Witham had {{deteriorated}} by 1802, and the Commissioners asked John Rennie for advice. He stated that the Kirkstead lock was badly placed, and the associated staunch {{was in danger of}} collapse. He recommended that it be demolished and rebuilt elsewhere, and also suggested that access to Boston should be through the Witham Naviagable Drains, rather than the Grand Sluice, or that a new cut should be built to the south of the sluice, to rejoin the river at Boston Harbour. In 1803, he suggested that High Bridge at Lincoln should be demolished and rebuilt. Four years later, he suggested that the locks at Kirkstead and Barlings should be removed, and replaced by one near Washingborough church. The Commissioners petitioned parliament in 1808, and a new Act of Parliament authorised the work, to be carried out by a company of proprietors. They could borrow £30,000 for the drainage element of the scheme and £70,000 for the navigation element. Two new locks were built, one at Stamp End and the other at Bardney, which replaced the original locks. A new channel was cut near Fiskerton, upstream of Bardney, and the plan for a lock at Washingborough was <b>dropped.</b> While <b>Stamp</b> End lock was being rebuilt, an alternative route was provided, utilising the Sincil Dyke and the South Delph. Rennie recorded that Branston Delph, Carlton Dike, Nocton Delph and Timberland Dike were navigable at the time. The proprietors obtained three more Acts of Parliament, in 1812, 1826 and 1829, all with the main aim of allowing more capital to be raised.|$|R
40|$|This paper uses nationally {{representative}} data to describe monthly cycles in food expenditure and food intake by food stamp recipients. Food expenditure peaks {{sharply in the}} first 3 days after food stamps are received. The corresponding cycle in food intake differs for various categories of food stamp recipients. Food stamp recipients who also receive AFDC appear to maintain steady food intake across the whole month, while AFDC nonrecipients experience a significant drop in intake {{at the end of}} the month. Children appear to maintain steady food intake, while adults appear to experience a significant drop. Households that conduct major grocery shopping trips more frequently than once per month maintain steady food intake, while households that shop less frequently experience a significant <b>drop.</b> The food <b>stamp</b> cycle has implications for two areas of research: the measurement of hunger and food insecurity in the United States and the measurement of the impact of the U. S. Food Stamp Program. Intramonthly patterns in food expenditure and food intake have potential implications for policy decisions about the frequency of food stamp benefit delivery, the evaluation of new electronic benefit transfer systems that are replacing traditional food stamp coupons, and nutrition education efforts. ...|$|R
30|$|Fv isolate P 03 was {{reactivated}} on PDA plates by incubation at 25  °C for 14  days. Three mycelial plugs (7  mm diameter) {{were transferred}} to sterile plastic bags containing 100  g of sterile cracked maize, hydrated with 40  ml of sterile distilled water and incubated at 25  °C for 14  days (Leyva-Madrigal et al. 2015). Sixty-five grams of the maize/fungus mix was then added to 1  kg styrofoam pots containing a mixture of non-sterile vermiculite:non-sterile soil (1 : 1 v/v). Fungal inoculum concentration (c.f.u./g) was estimated using the “massive <b>stamping</b> <b>drop</b> plate” method (Corral-Lugo et al. 2012) in Nash–Snyder agar plates. To inoculate plants with bacteria, root systems of five-days-germinated plantlets (hybrid Dk 2038 from Dekalb®) were submerged for 10  min in a bacterial suspension (5  ×  108  c.f.u/ml) of B 25, blot dried and then planted in a pot. One plant was placed per pot (one replicate). A completely randomized design with 5 replicates per treatment was used. The following treatments were included: untreated control (untreated maize seeds); strain B 25 (maize seeds treated with B. cereus B 25 without Fv P 03); control Fv (untreated maize seeds containing Fv P 03); strain B 25  + Fv (maize seeds treated with B. cereus B 25 and Fv P 03).|$|R
40|$|The Timepix {{particle}} tracking telescope {{has been}} developed {{as part of the}} LHCb VELO Upgrade project, supported by the Medipix Collaboration and the AIDA framework. It is a primary piece of infrastructure for the VELO Upgrade project and is being used for the development of new sensors and front end technologies for several upcoming LHC trackers and vertexing systems. The telescope is designed around the dual capability of the Timepix ASICs to provide information about either the deposited charge or the timing information from tracks traversing the 14 × 14 mm matrix of 55 × 55 μm pixels. The rate of reconstructed tracks available is optimised by taking advantage of the shutter driver readout architecture of the Timepix chip, operated with existing readout systems. Results of tests conducted in the SPS North Area beam facility at CERN show that the telescope typically provides reconstructed track rates during the beam spills of between 3. 5 and 7. 5 kHz, depending on beam conditions. The tracks are time stamped with 1 ns resolution with an efficiency of above 98 % and provide a pointing resolution at the centre of the telescope of ∼ 1. 6 μm. By <b>dropping</b> the time <b>stamping</b> requirement the rate can be increased to ∼ 15 kHz, at the expense of a small increase in background. The telescope infrastructure provides CO 2 cooling and a flexible mechanical interface to the device under test, and has been used {{for a wide range of}} measurements during the 2011 - 2012 data taking campaigns. © 2013 Elsevier B.

The proprietors obtained three more Acts of Parliament, in 1812, 1826 and 1829, all with the main aim of allowing more capital to be raised.Tolls on the Witham had gradually risen as improvements had been made. £263 was raised in 1763-4, and had reached £898 by 1790. In 1819, income exceeded £4,100 for the six months from March to September, and a five per cent dividend was paid in the following year. By 1826, over £!80,000 had been spent on improvements, and another £40,000 was needed. However, the proprietors were still optimistic, and commissioned Sir John Rennie to investigate an extension to link the Witham to the River Ancholme, but although he made two proposals, neither was implemented. Most traffic was carried by sailing vessels of in barges hauled by horses, but in March 1816, the first steam packet boat arrived on the river. It was named Witham and had been built by Shuttleworth and Robinson, whose yard was on Sincil Dyke. Despite a boiler explosion in March 1817, fortunately without causing injury to any of the crew or the 30 passengers, a second steam packet was operating by July 1817, and they soon displaced the sailing packet boats. During a flood in 1828, one of them lost power when a floating hedge became jammed in the paddle wheels. In the following year, a Lincoln man, William Pool invented a new type of paddlewheel, which resulted in the boats travelling faster, and in 1836, wooden vessels were superseded by iron packet boats.|$|R
6000|$|... "A feeling, sir," [...] he explained, [...] "perfectly comprehensible {{in a man}} {{properly}} {{grateful for}} the many kindnesses received from the best families of merchants and other native gentlemen of independent means, who, barely saved by us from {{the excesses of the}} mob, seemed, to my mind's eye, destined to become the prey in person and fortune of the native soldiery, which, as is well known, behave with regrettable barbarity to the inhabitants during their civil commotions. And then, sir, there were the Goulds, for both of whom, man and wife, I could not but entertain the warmest feelings deserved by their hospitality and kindness. I felt, too, the dangers of the gentlemen of the Amarilla Club, who had made me honorary member, and had treated me with uniform regard and civility, both in my capacity of Consular Agent and as Superintendent of an important Steam Service. Miss Antonia Avellanos, the most beautiful and accomplished young lady whom it had ever been my privilege to speak to, was not a little in my mind, I confess. How the interests of my Company would be affected by the impending change of officials claimed a large share of my attention, too. In short, sir, I was extremely anxious and very tired, as you may suppose, by the exciting and memorable events in which I had taken my little part. The Company's building containing my residence was within five minutes' walk, with the attraction of some supper and of my hammock (I always take my nightly rest in a hammock, as the most suitable to the climate); but somehow, sir, though evidently I could do nothing for any one by remaining about, I could not tear myself away from that wharf, where the fatigue made me stumble painfully at times. The night was excessively dark--the darkest I remember in my life; so that I began to think that the arrival of the transport from Esmeralda could not possibly take place before daylight, owing to the difficulty of navigating the gulf. The mosquitoes bit like fury. We have been infested here with mosquitoes before the late improvements; a peculiar harbour brand, sir, renowned for its ferocity. They were like a cloud about my head, and I shouldn't wonder that but for their attacks I would have dozed off as I walked up and down, and got a heavy fall. I kept on smoking cigar after cigar, more to protect myself from being eaten up alive than from any real relish for the weed. Then, sir, when perhaps for the twentieth time I was approaching my watch to the lighted end in order to see the time, and observing with surprise that it wanted yet ten minutes to midnight, I heard the splash of a ship's propeller--an unmistakable sound to a sailor's ear on such a calm night. It was faint indeed, because they were advancing with precaution and dead slow, both on account of the darkness and from their desire of not revealing too soon their presence: a very unnecessary care, because, I verily believe, in all the enormous extent of this harbour I was the only living soul about. Even the usual staff of watchmen and others had been absent from their posts for several nights owing to the disturbances. I stood stock still, after <b>dropping</b> and <b>stamping</b> out my cigar--a circumstance highly agreeable, I should think, to the mosquitoes, if I may judge from the state of my face next morning. But that was a trifling inconvenience in comparison with the brutal proceedings I became victim of on the part of Sotillo. Something utterly inconceivable, sir; more like the proceedings of a maniac than the action of a sane man, however lost to all sense of honour and decency. But Sotillo was furious at the failure of his thievish scheme." ...|$|R
