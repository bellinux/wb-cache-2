500|$|Going {{into the}} ninth season, the {{producers}} decided to drastically change the show. The {{style of the}} opening credits in [...] "Nothing Important Happened Today" [...] were changed from the original credits, which, more or less, had been {{the same for the}} previous eight seasons. The credits included new graphics as well as new cards for Gish and Pileggi. The finale episode of the series, [...] "The Truth", was written by series creator Carter; he later noted, [...] "It's the end—you don't get another chance. So you'd better put everything you've ever wanted to put in into the episode. There were things to distract us from what was really going on. The band was breaking up." [...] He expounded on the idea, saying, [...] "Frank [...] and I [...] it was probably time to go [...] it was strange to be writing these things knowing {{it was the last time}} we'd see Scully doing certain things or hear Mulder saying certain things." [...] Spotnitz explained, [...] "What was <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>nice</b> that Chris made the announcement in January is that we had times to wrap our minds around the end and plan for it and give all of the characters their due." [...] Gish later said, [...] "I have a great respect for the elegant in which they're closing the curtain". Bruce Harwood called the finale the [...] "passing of a generation".|$|E

5000|$|McKay {{was also}} interviewed about the {{possible}} sequel. [...] "We're kicking around the idea of Step Brothers 2," [...] he said. [...] "We feel like there's way more fat to be mined there. While it isn't quite the legend that Anchorman is, it has built <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a <b>nice</b> following. We {{think it could be}} a pretty fun one." [...] He added that Ferrell and Reilly's characters would be mature and have jobs. [...] "One of them's married and has a kid. They're still <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> goofballs but they've taken three or four steps. Then we have an idea for something happens that knocks him back to square one, and one of the brothers, John C. Reilly sort of instigates it, like 'we can't take this anymore.' And things go really bad, their lives <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fall apart. They have to pull it back together is sort of the basic structure." [...] McKay has also said that ideas that were not used in the first film may be used in the sequel.|$|R

Maybe our theater isn't as good as shows in Paris. All right! I don't want to see any foreign culture suddenly forced on us--whether it's street-planning or table-manners or crazy communistic ideas." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The girl went {{up within}} ten {{feet of the}} bum idol, and got down and massaged her nose with the floor, like the rest did. Then she went nearer and laid the flower wreath on the block of stone at High Jack's feet.

6000|$|Peter chuckled. [...] "It {{sounds more}} than <b>KIND</b> <b>of</b> <b>nice</b> to me," [...] said he. [...] "Do you know, I {{used to think}} that Sammy Jay never did and never could say {{anything}} nice, but I've just changed my mind. Though he isn't saying it to be nice, it really is the nicest thing I've ever heard him say. We haven't been able to keep our secret, so I think the very best {{thing we can do is}} to invite everybody to call. Then we can get it over with and have a little time to ourselves. Here come the Merry Little Breezes, and I know that they will be glad to take the invitations for us." ...|$|E
5000|$|Nice Try, The Devil was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews upon its release. The A.V. Club named it the 6th best album of 2013, saying, [...] "Nice Try, The Devil builds on what Holmes established with his great 2011 album, Impregnated With Wonder, where folks would kill for the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> guffaws <b>Nice</b> Try, The Devil produces."

Consequence of Sound reviews this by saying, [...] "Nice Try, The Devil is a haphazard rodeo molded {{in the mind of}} a charismatic optimist. There are plenty of laughs, plus a nice dose weirdness, if you’re into that sort of thing." [...] Rate Your Music rated it 3.49 out of 5 stars according to 17 users.|$|R
500|$|Bushnell {{felt that}} Pong was {{especially}} significant in {{its role as}} a social lubricant, since it was multiplayer-only and did not require each player to use more than one hand: [...] "It was very common to have a girl with a quarter in hand pull a guy off a bar stool and say, 'I'd like to play Pong and there's nobody to play.' It was a way you could play games, you were sitting shoulder to shoulder, you could talk, you could laugh, you could challenge each other ... As you became better friends, you could put down your beer and hug. You could put your arm around the person. You could play left-handed if you so desired. In fact, {{there are a lot of}} people who have come up to me over the years and said, 'I met my wife playing Pong,' and that's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a <b>nice</b> thing to have achieved." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{recent years}} however, the album has been {{revisited}} by both critics and musicians with more sympathetic and favorable reviews. In 2011 music writer Steven Shehori included Squeeze in his [...] "Criminally Overlooked Albums" [...] series for The Huffington Post, {{and in a}} lengthy review of the album, offered the following positive assessment of Squeeze: [...] "if you pluck it from the shackles of its murky back-story, Squeeze {{is nothing short of}} a quintessential listening experience." [...] The UK band Squeeze took their name from its title according to band member Chris Difford, who also offered the following opinion of the album in a 2012 interview: [...] "It's an odd record, but the name came from that, definitely. … In a retrospective way I really enjoy it. It has <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a naivety about it". [...] In 1995, Doug Yule described the recording of Squeeze being [...] "like the blind leading the blind, me leading myself. That's what came out of it, I don't even have a copy of it. But it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> a <b>nice</b> memory for me and <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> an embarrassment at the same time. I wish I had my eyes wider open, but it was nice to get my name and my songs out there." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lorely's stage {{name was}} {{inspired}} by a tarot card reading she did with a friend: “The first card he pulled out was an Empress card and I was like, 'It's me, I am Empress.' ... the Empress card is connected to fertility and mothering and strength.

5000|$|NME {{conceded that}} [...] "this album is... well, it's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>nice,</b> you know? A trifle over-arranged, {{and more than}} a little corny, but very soothing. All in all, {{possibly}} the most enjoyable Melanie I've heard, far more mature and purged of many of the more cloying qualities of her earlier stuff." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{video for}} the song has been released.

[...] The music video was released on August 9, 2011 on CMT. The video starts with McCreery and his band getting set up in daylight for a Fourth of July party to take place that night.

Meanwhile, the focus goes to four couples, a blonde, curly-haired girl looking for a guy and then finding him and hug, a blonde girl and a guy holding hands, talking and kissing, a black haired girl running into her guy friend and hugging and a blonde girl and a guy getting food, holding hands and talking. Fireworks go off in the air as McCreery and his band go into the key change, and the couples switch to watching the fireworks and the concert. McCreery's mother is featured in the video.

5000|$|From {{my point}} of view, Yiddish culture today isn't just fading away, but disappearing. It is stored as memories, as {{fragments}} of phrases, as books that have long gone unread. ... Yiddish culture is dying and this should be treated with utmost calm. There {{is no need to}} pity that which cannot be resurrected — it has receded into the world of the enchanting past, where it should remain. Any artificial culture, a culture without replenishment, is meaningless. ... Everything that happens with Yiddish culture is transformed into a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> cabaret—epistolary genre, <b>nice,</b> cute to the ear and the eye, but having nothing to do with high art, because there is no natural, national soil. In Russia, it is the memory of the departed, sometimes sweet memories. But it's the memories of what will never be again. Perhaps that's why these memories are always so sharp.|$|R
