2500|$|Sometimes a {{loud noise}} or high pitched squeal {{occurs when the}} brakes are applied. Most brake squeal is {{produced}} by vibration (resonance instability) of the brake components, especially the pads and discs (known as force-coupled excitation). This type of squeal should not negatively affect brake stopping performance. Techniques include adding chamfer pads to the contact points between caliper pistons and the pads, the bonding insulators (<b>damping</b> <b>material)</b> to pad backplate, the brake shims between the brake pad and pistons, etc. All should be coated with an extremely high temperature, high solids lubricant to help reduce squeal. This allows the metal to metal parts to move independently {{of each other and}} thereby eliminate the buildup of energy that can create a frequency that is heard as brake squeal, groan, or growl. It is inherent that some pads are going to squeal more given the type of pad and its usage case. Pads typically rated to withstand very high temperatures for extended periods tend to produce high amounts of friction leading to more noise during brake application. [...] Cold weather combined with high early-morning humidity (dew) often worsens brake squeal, although the squeal generally stops when the lining reaches regular operating temperatures. This more strongly affects pads meant to be used at higher temperatures. Dust on the brakes may also cause squeal and commercial brake cleaning products are designed to remove dirt and other contaminants. Pads without a proper amount of transfer material could also squeal, this can be remedied by bedding or re-bedding the brake pads to brake discs.|$|E

40|$|Given the {{importance}} of simulation techniques in automotive engineering, {{there is a lack}} of implementation regarding these techniques in the acoustics of <b>damping</b> <b>materials</b> for air-borne sound. Biot’s calculations have proven its abilities to simulate the acoustic characteristics of these <b>damping</b> <b>materials.</b> However, the characterisation of essential structural parameters, such as Young’s modulus and loss factor, in order to conduct Biot’s calculations have been inconclusive. Thus, the primary research objective of this study is to propose a new measurement system for the structural Biot parameters. After a comprehensive literature review has been undertaken on <b>damping</b> <b>materials,</b> as well as measurement apparatuses for Young’s modulus and loss factor of <b>damping</b> <b>materials,</b> two causes of measurement errors have been identified. Unknown stresses in measurement apparatuses and inhomogeneous, polytrophic and viscoelastic behaviour of specimens. A new measurement system that does not affect the specimens with unknown stresses and accounts for their complex behaviour required investigation. Non-contact ultrasound had been selected as a solution to determine the aforementioned parameters, since these methods do not necessarily touch or compress the specimen, which led to unknown stresses and neglection of the complex specimen behaviour with the aforementioned techniques. Although ultrasound had been used to determine structural parameters on various types of materials, it has never been used to measure soft porous <b>damping</b> <b>materials.</b> In order to find possible solutions, various sources using ultrasonics to investigate struc- tural parameters had been reviewed. In order to calculate structural parameters, the longitudinal and transversal wave velocity inside the specimen had to be determined. The main findings showed that non-contact ultrasound will be able to evaluate the Young’s modulus, loss factor as well as Poisson’s ratio. Consequently, it was shown that longitudinal velocity measurements could be conducted using well known transmission measurements. However, well known approaches would not be sufficient measuring the transversal wave velocity in soft <b>damping</b> <b>materials.</b> This problem was addressed with a special gas to be used, with lower sound speed velocity in the fluid than in the solid. Moreso, a new method determining the transversal wave velocity had been found, as it would enable the use of an even larger range of <b>damping</b> <b>materials,</b> especially ones with heavy frames and lower porosity. It will use refracted waves inside the specimen and the determination of the convertion position of the transversal to the longitudinal wave at the rear specimen surface. At the end of the study, hardware components were selected and a test rig was constructed, which should be able to prove that a determination of structural Biot parameters with non-contact ultrasound is possible with less errors instead of using mechanical transfer function systems. The development of measurement software as well as the testing of the measurement system and its validation was not under investigation in this dissertation. This study has expanded on the body of literature knowledge regarding non-contact ultrasound. Furthermore, a significant contribution has been made towards a new measurement system measuring Young’s modulus and loss factor which circumvents errors in mechanical transfer function systems. This will contribute to more precise simulations of <b>damping</b> <b>materials</b> and <b>damped</b> enclosures, which may ultimately result in enhanced efficiency of <b>damping</b> <b>materials</b> as well as the acoustic packaging of cars...|$|R

50|$|Glasspacks are an old, simple, and {{relatively}} inexpensive muffler design that are effective at reducing back pressure, {{but not very}} effective at muffling noise. A longer glasspack will reduce noise {{to a greater extent}} than a shorter one. Sound is also dissipated into the fiberglass <b>damping</b> <b>material.</b> Other glasspack mufflers have perforated louvers punched into the center core which can reduce total flow capacity. The turbulence created by the perforated louvers therefore achieves greater muffling capacity at the expense of total volume of air flow. The more turbulence created, the greater the muffling & less total air flow / power production capacity. Depending on the directionality of the louvers, one can choose between slightly higher flow capacity or slightly greater muffling. This lower flow but slightly quieter design approach is commonly used in glasspack mufflers.|$|E

40|$|Experience {{shows that}} the noise and sound quality in {{vehicles}} are often a recurring criticism. The bodies of modern vehicles consist predominantly of thin sheets of metal. It is hard to prevent the excitation of bending vibrations and the subsequent emission of disturbing noise while driving. The noise spectrum in a car that can be heard by the driver is from ”latent roar” to ”chattering” noise {{of the body and}} engine. In automotive vehicles <b>damped</b> <b>materials,</b> especially plastics or materials made from sheet metal and surface damping treatments, are used. Those have high internal energy losses and damp sound oscillatory systems found in the body or interior of cars. A further advantage of such treated components is that they are applied to existing components working over wide temperature and frequency ranges. Many companies provide such ”sound-absorbing compounds”. The requirements for these <b>damping</b> <b>materials</b> are high temperature-resistance, water repellence, fuel and oil-resistance and good adhesion to the base material [17]. The acoustic properties, especially the damping of the plate vibrations through rubber are of interest. the question arises how can the damping coeficient of coated metal sheets can be measured and secondly, by how much the road noise is reduced when built-in sheets are coated with a known <b>damped</b> <b>material.</b> With the Oberst Bar Test Method (named after Dr. H. Oberst) the properties are determined of the internal <b>damping</b> <b>materials</b> {{that can be used to}} simulate mechanical constructions to determine damping of larger surfaces. This method describes a laboratory test procedure for measuring the mechanical properties of <b>damped</b> <b>materials.</b> A block diagram of the test system consisting of a <b>damped</b> <b>material</b> bonded to a vibrating cantilever steel bar is shown in figure 2. 1. This method is useful for testing materials such as metals, enamels, ceramics, rubbers, plastics, reinforced epoxy matrices and wood. In addition to damping measurement, the test allows for the determination of the Young’s modulus E of the material. E is calculated from the resonance frequency of a given mode and from the physical constants of the bar. By associating the damping factor with the Young’s modulus, a complex quantity is defined which is called the Complex Modulus of Elasticity. Measurements of dynamic mechanical properties are also useful in the research on the molecular structure of materials...|$|R

50|$|This design falls between {{acoustic}} {{suspension and}} bass reflex enclosures. It {{can be thought}} of as either a leaky sealed box or a ported box with large amounts of port damping. By setting up a port, and then blocking it precisely with sufficiently tightly packed fiber filling, it's possible to adjust the damping in the port as desired. The result is control of the resonance behavior of the system which improves low-frequency reproduction, according to some designers. Dynaco was a primary producer of these enclosures for many years, using designs developed by a Scandinavian driver maker. The design remains uncommon among commercial designs currently available. A reason for this may be that adding <b>damping</b> <b>material</b> is a needlessly inefficient method of increasing damping; the same alignment can be achieved by simply choosing a loudspeaker driver with the appropriate parameters and precisely tuning the enclosure and port for the desired response.|$|E
50|$|Limitations of {{parabolic}} reflector loudspeakers include {{the fact that}} they are comparatively large and bulky, and that they have a fixed beam width with no ability to broaden or narrow the coverage pattern without changing the curvature of the dish. Their beam width is wider for low frequencies than it is for high frequencies, so at the periphery of the coverage pattern there is a region of sound coverage that doesn't receive the full strength of the high frequencies. In addition, some frequencies are reflected more efficiently than others, so the frequency response is uneven unless audio signal processing correction is applied before the signal reaches the amplifier. The presence and placement of the speaker driver prevents the center of the parabolic dish from reflecting sound outward, as that sound would reflect back into the speaker driver itself. In some loudspeaker designs, a hole is cut at the center of the parabolic dish, or <b>damping</b> <b>material</b> placed, such that no sound is reflected directly at the speaker driver.|$|E
