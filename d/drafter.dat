5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the <b>drafter</b> of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that {{a bill of rights}} listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future Bill of Rights <b>drafter</b> James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|The {{allegations}} were {{taken up by}} several prominent critics, including leaders of the People's Alliance for Democracy, constitution <b>drafter</b> Chai-anan Samudavanija, Senator Sophon Supapong, writer Pramote Nakornthab, and Democrat leader Thaworn Senniam.|$|E
5|$|The Attorney-General's Department {{also managed}} {{litigation}} {{on behalf of}} the government. Initially the department contracted private law firms to actually conduct the litigation, but in 1903 the office of the Commonwealth Crown Solicitor was established, with Charles Powers the first to hold the job. The other Crown Solicitors that Garran worked with included Gordon Castle (with whom he had also worked as a <b>drafter)</b> and William Sharwood.|$|E
50|$|With CAD systems, <b>drafters</b> {{can create}} and store {{drawings}} electronically {{so that they}} can be viewed, printed, or programmed directly into automated manufacturing systems. CAD systems also permit <b>drafters</b> to quickly prepare variations of a design. Although <b>drafters</b> use CAD extensively, it is only a tool. <b>Drafters</b> still need knowledge of traditional drafting techniques, in addition to CAD skills. Despite the near global use of CAD systems, manual drafting and sketching are used in certain applications.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} the legislative drafting process and the <b>drafter’s</b> role {{in the production of}} quality legislation - looking in particular at questions surrounding the way <b>drafters</b> handle the drafting process, the issue of permission to draft, drafting instructions, drafting manual, the <b>drafter’s</b> skills, the quality of legislation, and applying Thornton’s five stages of drafting process. The author argues that <b>Drafters</b> should adopt Thornton’s five stages of the drafting process (understanding the proposal, analysing the proposal, designing the law, composing and developing the draft and the scrutiny of the draft) in order {{to improve the quality of}} legislation. The author also identifies any gaps in the process and the problems <b>drafters</b> encounter, which directly or indirectly affect the quality of the legislation they produce. The discussion is supported with arguments put forward by different legal experts and legal professionals. Examples are drawn from the Sierre Leone and Rwandan jurisdictions based on interviews with <b>drafters</b> from five key Rwandan legislative institutions, namely: the Ministry of Justice, the Rwandan Senate, the Rwandan Parliament, the President’s office and the Prime Minister’s office...|$|R
50|$|<b>Drafters</b> {{drawings}} provide visual {{guidelines and}} show how {{to construct a}} product or structure. Drawings include technical details and specify dimensions, materials, and procedures. <b>Drafters</b> fill in technical details using drawings, rough sketches, specifications, and calculations made by engineers, surveyors, architects, or scientists. For example, <b>drafters</b> use their knowledge of standardized building techniques to draw {{in the details of}} a structure. Some use their understanding of engineering and manufacturing theory and standards to draw the parts of a machine; they determine design elements, such as the numbers and kinds of fasteners needed to assemble the machine. <b>Drafters</b> use technical handbooks, tables, calculators, and computers to complete their work.|$|R
5|$|In this role, Garran was {{responsible}} for organising the first federal election in March 1901, and for organising the transfer of various government departments from the states to the federal government, including the Department of Defence, the postal and telegraphic services (now part of the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts) and the Department of Trade and Customs (now part of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). As parliamentary <b>drafter,</b> Garran also developed legislation to administer those new departments and other important legislation.|$|E
5|$|From late August 1869 to May the {{following}} year, Levski {{was active in}} the Romanian capital Bucharest. He was in contact with revolutionary writer and journalist Lyuben Karavelov, whose participation in the foundation of the Bulgarian Literary Society Levski approved in writing. Karavelov's publications gathered a number of followers and initiated the foundation of the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee (BRCC), a centralised revolutionary diasporic organisation that included Levski as a founding member and statute <b>drafter.</b> In disagreement over planning, Levski departed from Bucharest in the spring of 1870 and began to put into action his concept of an internal revolutionary network.|$|E

5000|$|Although the {{drafting}} process was completely controlled by Americans, the <b>drafters</b> did not simply import the American constitution, {{nor did they}} create a completely new constitution either. According to Kades, [...] "Japanese sources were most useful. Used to good advantage were outlines of draft constitutions that had been published by the JapaneseProgressive, Liberal, and Socialist Parties. The <b>drafters</b> also referred to constitutions from approximately twelve other countries that were obtained by Beate Sirota and Lieutenant Milton Esman, and Kades encouraged <b>drafters</b> to also consult the Meiji Constitution of 1889.|$|R

5000|$|In the past, <b>drafters</b> sat at drawing {{boards and}} used pencils, pens, compasses, protractors, triangles, and other {{drafting}} devices {{to prepare a}} drawing by hand. From the 1980s through 1990s, board drawings were going out of style as the newly developed computer-aided design (CAD) system was released {{and was able to}} produce technical drawings at a faster pace. Many modern <b>drafters</b> operate computer-assisted drafting equipment and software such as AutoCAD, Vectorworks, Revit, or Solidworks but board drafting still remains the base of the CAD system. Consequently, <b>drafters</b> may also be casually referred to as CAD operators, engineering draftspersons, or engineering technicians.|$|R

25|$|Drafting or {{technical}} drawing is {{the means by}} which mechanical engineers design products and create instructions for manufacturing parts. A technical drawing can be a computer model or hand-drawn schematic showing all the dimensions necessary to manufacture a part, as well as assembly notes, a list of required materials, and other pertinent information. A U.S. mechanical engineer or skilled worker who creates technical drawings may be referred to as a <b>drafter</b> or draftsman. Drafting has historically been a two-dimensional process, but computer-aided design (CAD) programs now allow the designer to create in three dimensions.|$|E

40|$|By {{drafting}} {{statutes and}} delegated acts, national legislative <b>drafters</b> {{play a crucial}} role in European Union (EU) compliance. Given their extensive legal training, they can be expected to operate as ‘guardians of EU law’ and thus correct national non-compliant tendencies. Yet, they also have a role as politically loyal civil servants, responsive to national political demands. This conntribution answers the question of to what extent Dutch legislative <b>drafters</b> fulfil a role of ‘guardian of EU law’. Using in-depth interviews, the paper analyses legislative drafters’ role conceptions and their strategies in case national political demands prove incompatible with EU legal requirements. It finds that most Dutch legislative <b>drafters</b> try to reconcile EU law with their ministers’ political demands, if necessary by reinterpreting EU law. When this proves unfeasible, most respondents prioritize political loyalty over EU legality. Ultimately, therefore, legislative <b>drafters</b> do not form an insurmountable normative factor in EU compliance...|$|R

25|$|While at the European Commission, Giammarinaro was {{instrumental}} {{in the development of the}} 2011 EU Directive on trafficking. Giammarinaro was the <b>drafter</b> of the first proposal for a Framework Decision on Trafficking, subsequently transformed into a Directive, and is widely regarded as one of the main actors in the negotiation leading to the adoption of Directive 2011/36 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings, and protecting its victims. Importantly, for the first time, an EU Directive in penal matters included strengthened victim provisions regarding victims’ rights in criminal proceedings, assistance and support before, during and after criminal proceedings, and special protective provisions for child victims.|$|E
25|$|The last {{moderate}} {{proposal was}} the Fourteenth Amendment, whose principal <b>drafter</b> was Representative John Bingham. It {{was designed to}} put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but it went much further. It extended citizenship to everyone born in the United States (except visitors and Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It guaranteed the Federal war debt would be paid (and promised the Confederate debt would never be paid). Johnson used his influence to block the amendment in the states since three-fourths of the states were required for ratification (the amendment was later ratified.). The moderate effort to compromise with Johnson had failed, and a political fight broke out between the Republicans (both Radical and moderate) on one side, {{and on the other}} side, Johnson and his allies in the Democratic Party in the North, and the conservative groupings (which used different names) in each southern state.|$|E
50|$|A {{great deal}} of Burke’s uneasiness of the Declaration lies in the <b>drafter’s</b> {{abandonment}} of the existing establishment. For Burke, constitutional legitimacy was derived not from the Rousseauian doctrine of general will, but from a form of inherited wisdom. He {{thought that it was}} arrogant and limiting for the <b>drafters</b> of the Declaration to cast aside traditional notions that had stood the test of time. Although it may seem to the <b>drafters</b> that they had abandoned the shackles of tradition, for Burke, they had limited their findings to the narrow minded conception of one person or group. This is the grounding from which Burke’s attack of the Declaration is based.|$|R
