Historically during the 1960s and before, the rain-fed Sahibi River which originates in Jaipur Distt. of Rajasthan passing through Alwar Distt. in Rajasthan and Gurgaon Distt. in Haryana entered U.T. of Delhi near Dhansa and spilled its overflow in the Najafgarh Jheel (lake) basin creating a seasonal lake, a vast area more than 300sq km was submerged in some seasons, this water then continued to flow {{on the other side}} forming a tributary and outfalled into River Yamuna. In the following decades this Sahibi River flow reaching Dhansa regulators was channelised by digging out a wide drain and connecting it directly to the River Yamuna, this in effect also completely drained off the seasonal Najafgarh Jheel which used to form here in the past. The <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> from Dhansa regulators to Keshopur Bus Depot on Outer Ring Road is wide with thick and high embankments, vast amount of water is retained in this widened drain by closing the Kakrola regulators under Najafgarh Road to recharge the local ground watertable hence it acts like an elongated lake as well.|$|E

Because these two parameters are dimensionless, different stacks can be easily compared. The model is validated with two experimental stacks differing in membrane type and spacer thickness, one with large ionic shortcut currents and one where this effect is less. The loss in efficiency decreased from 25 to 5 % for a well-designed stack.

50|$|Trench drains {{are made}} in a factory that specializes in making {{concrete}} shapes. The channel pieces range in width and length, larger channels requiring heavy equipment to move them, however most channels can be picked up and moved easily by hand. The channels are formed in large metal forms that (usually) have a pre-determined channel width, depth, and slope. Like in the cast-in-place method, a metal frame {{is attached to the}} form and concrete is poured and finished in a factory atmosphere. The advantage to the pre-cast trench drain is again time savings - big time savings at the job site. Pre-cast trench drains made of a polymer concrete are also more sturdy and reliable than cast-in-place trenches. Once a trough is dug, the pre-cast trench sections can be installed and quickly be put into service through numerous methods. A patty method can be used by placing clumps of concrete at each trench <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> joint and the channels can be levelled and set as such. Further installation methods involve clipping rebar through installation device used with the channel. Concrete will need to be poured to surround the trench drain so that the load can be transferred from the channel and grate to the surrounding areas.|$|E

40|$|A {{new concept}} for the low-frequency {{dispersion}} aspect of large-signal modeling of microwave III-V field-effect transistors is presented. The approach circumvents the integrability problem between the small-signal transconductance G mRF and the output conductance G dsRF {{by means of}} an integral formulation and simultaneously yields a proper description of the <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> current in the small- and large-signal regime. In the theoretical description of the approach and in an extraction example of an AlGaN/GaN HEMT, it is shown that three independent 2 -D nonlinear quantities determine the intrinsic <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> current (G mRF, G dsRF, and dc current). The concept is transferred to the modeling of the nonlinear charge control, where the integrability problem between the large-signal charge functions and the small-signal intrinsic capacitance matrix (C gs, C gd, and C ds) is addressed consistently under consideration of the charge control delays. For the large-signal modeling under pulsed-dc/RF excitation, the dc continuous wave (dc-CW) modeling approach is combined with the state-modeling concept using a superposition formula for drain current and charges, respectively. The new model is implemented in ADS using a 12 - and 14 -port symbolically defined device for both the dc-CW and pulsed-RF case, respectively. The model has been verified by comparison to measured CW and pulsed-RF load-pull and waveform data at 10 -GHz fundamental frequency...|$|E

METHODS: A vertical banded Roux-en-Y gastric bypass was performed in 33 morbidly obese patients. Drainage of the peritoneal cavity was performed in each case using three different types of drain selected in a randomized manner: a latex tubular drain, a Watterman tubulolaminar drain, and a silicone <b>channeled</b> <b>drain.</b> Drain permeability, contamination of the drained fluid, ease of handling, and patient discomfort were evaluated postoperatively over a period of 7 d. RESULTS: The patients with the silicone <b>channeled</b> <b>drain</b> had larger volumes of drainage compared to patients with tubular and tubulolaminar drains between the third and seventh postoperative days. In addition, a lower incidence of discomfort and of contamination with bacteria of a more pathogenic profile was observed in the patients with the silicone <b>channeled</b> <b>drain.</b> CONCLUSION: The silicone <b>channeled</b> <b>drain</b> was more comfortable and had less chance of occlusion, which is important in the detection of delayed dehiscence.

40|$|Suspended {{sediment}} is a {{major source}} of pollution in irrigation-dominated watersheds. However, {{little is known about the}} process and mechanisms of suspended sediment transport in drain channels directly connected to agricultural fields. This paper explains sediment dynamics using averaged 5 min flow discharge Q (m 3 s 1) and suspended sediment concentration C (mg l 1) collected during one crop season in a small catchment containing a first-order <b>drain</b> <b>channel</b> and its connected six agricultural fields within the Salton Sea watershed. The statistical properties and average trends of Q and C were investigated for both early (i. e. November) and late (i. e. January) stages of a crop season. Further in-depth analysis on sediment dynamics was performed by selecting two typical single-field irrigation events and two multiple-field irrigation events. For each set of irrigation events, the process of suspended sediment transport was revealed by examining hydrograph and sediment graph responses. The mechanisms underlying suspended sediment transport were investigated by analysing the types of corresponding hysteresis loop. Finally, sediment rating curves for both hourly and daily data at early and late stages and for the entire crop season were established to seek possible sediment-transport predictive model(s). The study suggests that the complicated processes of suspended sediment transport in irrigation-dominated watersheds require stochastic rather than deterministi...|$|E

30|$|Another {{drawback}} in the down-scaling {{process of}} TFETs is to fabricate metallurgical junctions {{due to the}} need for the creation of abrupt junctions at high temperatures which is difficult and expensive [7]. This problem can be solved using junctionless TFETs (JLTFETs) [22, 23]. JLTFET uses high-doping concentrations in the <b>drain,</b> <b>channel,</b> and source. It has provided N+–I–P+ for N-JLTFETs similar to doping profile of an N-TFET using two methods. One method is the use of the charge plasma concept, wherein the desired doping profile is created by choosing appropriate workfunctions for the gates called the polarity gate (PG) located at the source region and the control gate (CG) located at the middle with a lower workfunction than PG for being a nearly intrinsic channel [24, 25, 26, 27]. As the same way, p-channel JLTFET has the similar structure [28]. Another method to create N+–I–P+ in JLTFET is using the electrically doped concept, in which P+ region underneath PG is created by applying an appropriate external bias voltage. These devices are known as EDTFET [29, 30, 31]. The other type of JLTFETs known as dopingless TFETs suppresses the need of a higher thermal budget and expensive thermal annealing technique due to refusing the physical doping [32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. In this structure, the drain region is also gated for creating N+ using charge plasma or electrically doped concepts. JLTFETs also include inferior Ion and ambipolar behavior. To overcome these problems, different methods have been investigated, such as: using heterostructures at source/channel interfaces [37, 38, 39, 40, 41], the assumption of gate workfunction engineering [42, 43, 44, 45], the adoption of hetero-gate dielectrics [46, 47, 48, 49], using Gaussian-doping profiles [22, 50, 51], applying source pockets [52], the consideration of strain engineering [53, 54], using ferroelectric insulators [40], and drain workfunction engineering for DLTFET [55, 56].|$|E

Flexible electronics based on plastic substrates have been extensively studied in this regard because of their versatility. However, their fabrication involves energy consuming complex procedures and processing of eco-unfriendly materials which limit their use to certain specific applications. Here we report the fabrication of a flexible all-carbon field effect transistor (FET) using a economically efficient, recyclable and biodegradable cellulose paper as both substrate as well as dielectric and pencil graphite as source, <b>drain,</b> <b>channel</b> and gate without using any expensive, toxic or non-biodegradable materials. The FET transfer characteristics shows ambipolar behavior which can be utilized in analog electronics applications like rectifier, mixer and frequency multipliers and its mobility was found to be very high compared to reduced graphene oxide based FETs. The FET was utilized as a strain sensor which shows excellent sensitivity for very low strains (of both tensile and compressive type) which is comparable to and even better than recently reported carbon nanotube and graphene based strain sensors. The sensitivity of the FET based strain sensor can be modulated by varying the gate voltage under strain. Furthermore, we investigated the performance of the sensor by integrating it with hand gloves to detect human motion. The results indicate that the sensor can be utilized in patients surveillance in healthcare and human-machine interface (HMI) applications. The successful fabrication of this paper based all-carbon transistor using only paper and pencil graphite and its application in human motion detection using strain sensing indicates that this approach can be used for developing highly scalable, low cost, low energy, flexible green electronics for healthcare without using any sophisticated fabrication methods or toxic chemicals...|$|E
