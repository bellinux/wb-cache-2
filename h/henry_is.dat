5|$|Today, {{the legend}} of <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> {{challenged}} by historians {{to the point of}} being labelled as pure imagination. Completely invented saints were not exceptional in Europe, and in the lack of evidence of either the crusade or Henry, that possibility may not be fully denied.|$|E

5|$|Henry (Brandon Scott) and Sam (Nadji Jeter) are two {{brothers}} that Ellie and Joel encounter {{while trying to}} escape {{from a group of}} hunters in Pittsburgh. <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> 25 years old, while Sam is thirteen. Joel and Henry initially think each other are hostile, until they see Sam and Ellie, respectively. Like Joel, <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> an experienced survivor, and the two decide to team up, since both pairs are looking for the Fireflies. They work together to overpower the bandits guarding the exit to the Quarantine Zone, and escape to an abandoned radio tower in the Suburbs. There, Joel and Henry bond over their mutual love of motorbikes, but Sam becomes morose and introverted, particularly after a conversation with Ellie over death and the Infected. The next day, it emerges that Sam was bitten while escaping the Suburbs, and he attacks Ellie, forcing Henry to kill him. Overcome with grief and guilt at his brother's death, Henry commits suicide with his gun.|$|E

In these spots, the players promote football as a game that must be played on behalf of children.|$|E
5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> {{best known}} for his six marriages and, in particular, his efforts to have his first marriage, to Catherine of Aragon, annulled. His {{disagreement}} with the Pope on the question of such an annulment led Henry to initiate the English Reformation, separating the Church of England from papal authority and appointing himself the Supreme Head of the Church of England. Despite his resulting excommunication, Henry remained a believer in core Catholic theological teachings.|$|E

5|$|Although Henry {{has never}} been officially canonized, he has been {{referred}} to as a saint since as early as 1296 according to a papal document of the time, and continues to be called as such today as well. On the basis of the traditional accounts of Henry's death, his recognition as saint took place prior to the founding of the Congregation for the Causes of the Saints and the official canonization process of the Roman Catholic Church. <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> currently commemorated on January 19 on the calendar of commemorations of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. January 19 is also Henry's name day in Sweden and Finland. He continues to be remembered as a local observance in the Catholic Church of Finland, where the cathedral church is dedicated to Henry's memory. The cathedral was consecrated in 1860 and is headed by fr. Marco Pasinato.|$|E

5|$|As {{a fan of}} the National Basketball Association (NBA), <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> {{often seen}} with his friend Tony Parker at games when not playing football. Henry stated in an {{interview}} that he admires basketball, as it is similar to football in pace and excitement. Having made regular trips to the NBA Finals in the past, he went to watch Parker and the San Antonio Spurs in the 2007 NBA Finals; and in the 2001 NBA Finals, he went to Philadelphia to help with French television coverage of the Finals as well as to watch Allen Iverson, whom he named as one of his favourite players.|$|E
5|$|Before {{they were}} {{destroyed}} in the Revolution, {{the remains of the}} king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> posed strikingly, with his head thrown back. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.|$|E
5|$|Henry has {{received}} many plaudits and awards in his football career. He was runner-up for the 2003 and 2004 FIFA World Player of the Year awards; {{in those two}} seasons, he also won back-to-back PFA Players' Player of the Year titles. <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> the only player ever to have won the FWA Footballer of the Year three times (2003, 2004, 2006), and the French Player of the Year on a record four occasions.

50|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> {{the son of}} Berthold and Eilika (Eiliswintha or Eila) of Walbeck. His father's {{parentage}} is {{not known}} with certainty, but {{he may have been}} a son of Arnulf, Duke of Bavaria. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> Bavarian, whoever his grandfather.|$|R
5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> {{generally}} {{credited with}} initiating the English Reformation – {{the process of}} transforming England from a Catholic country to a Protestant one – though his progress at the elite and mass levels is disputed, and the precise narrative not widely agreed. Certainly, in 1527, Henry, until then an observant and well-informed Catholic, appealed to the Pope for an annulment of his marriage to Catherine. No annulment was immediately forthcoming, the result in part of Charles V's control of the Papacy. The traditional narrative gives this refusal as the trigger for Henry's rejection of papal supremacy (which he had previously defended), though as historian A. F. Pollard has argued, even if Henry had not needed an annulment, Henry may have come to reject papal control over the governance of England purely for political reasons.|$|E
5|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> of Antillean heritage: his father, Antoine, is from Guadeloupe (La Désirade island), and his mother, Maryse, is from Martinique. He {{was born}} and raised in Les Ulis suburb of Paris which, despite {{sometimes}} being seen as a tough neighbourhood, provided good footballing facilities. As a seven-year-old, Henry showed great potential, prompting Claude Chezelle to recruit him to the local club CO Les Ulis. His father pressured him to attend training, although the youngster was not particularly drawn to football. He joined US Palaiseau in 1989, but after a year his father fell out with the club, so Henry moved to ES Viry-Châtillon and played there for two years. US Palaiseau coach Jean-Marie Panza, Henry's future mentor, followed him there.|$|E
5|$|In a Storybrooke drugstore, Henry (Jared S. Gilmore) meets a {{young girl}} named Ava (Karley Scott Collins). <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> stopped by the store owner for shoplifting, which reveals Ava and her brother Nicholas (Quinn Lord) were using Henry to smuggle stolen merchandise. Regina (Lana Parrilla) and Sheriff Emma Swan (Jennifer Morrison) arrive to handle the juveniles. Emma discovers the {{siblings}} are living without parents and almost no food. In need of help, Emma resolves to find Ava and Nicholas's father (Nicholas Lea) out {{of a desire to}} keep them out of the foster system she herself was raised in. Regina calls social services, but the system would have to place the kids in two different homes in Boston. Determined to keep her promise not to separate them, Emma asks them for something that had belonged to their father. Ava provides her with a compass.|$|E
50|$|Ivan <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> {{convicted of}} {{multiple}} sexual assaults in Vancouver, Canada from 1980 to 1982. Similar assaults continued {{while he was}} jailed, leading to further investigation by police. His conviction was overturned in 2010. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> imprisoned for 27 years.|$|R
50|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> born at Juniper Green, Midlothian, Scotland. His father, Robert <b>Henry,</b> <b>was</b> a sawmiller and {{on leaving}} school, David {{worked as a}} clerk in the Mossy Paper Mill at Colinton while {{attending}} night classes in Edinburgh, possibly at Heriot-Watt College.|$|R
50|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> {{descended from}} the Poděbrady branch of the Kunštát family. His parents were King George of Poděbrady of Bohemia and Kunigunde of Sternberg. In order of {{siblings}} <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> the third son after the older brothers Boček and Victor.|$|R
5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In this portrait, {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left foot rests on a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{inductor}} is a conductor, {{usually a}} coil of wire, that stores energy in {{a magnetic field}} {{in response to the}} current through it. When the current changes, the magnetic field does too, inducing a voltage between the ends of the conductor. The induced voltage is proportional to the time rate of change of the current. The constant of proportionality is termed the inductance. The unit of inductance is the henry, named after Joseph Henry, a contemporary of Faraday. One <b>henry</b> <b>is</b> the inductance that will induce a potential difference of one volt if the current through it changes at a rate of one ampere per second. The inductor's behaviour is in some regards converse to that of the capacitor: it will freely allow an unchanging current, but opposes a rapidly changing one.|$|E
5|$|The {{king and}} queen were not pleased with married life. The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the {{submissive}} role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and it made her many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534, he saw her failure {{to give him a}} son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine. <b>Henry</b> <b>is</b> traditionally believed to have had an affair with Margaret ("Madge") Shelton in 1535, although historian Antonia Fraser argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister Mary Shelton.|$|E
50|$|Following the season, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> {{signed to}} a reserve/future {{contract}} on January 24, 2009. During training camp practices, backup quarterback Erik Ainge praised Henry, who taught his fellow receivers {{how to use}} their strengths to their advantage. In spite of the positive praise, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> again released from the team on September 5, 2009 during the final roster cuts. <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> signed to the team's practice squad, two days later, where he remained for the season.|$|R
50|$|On 8 October 2008, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> {{approached}} by manager John Barnes {{to play for}} Jamaica. On 20 February 2011, <b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> named in the 40-man England provisional squad for the game against Denmark, but {{did not make the}} final cut of 26.|$|R
50|$|<b>Henry</b> <b>was</b> born in Chicago, Illinois and {{graduated}} from Pasadena High School, Pasadena, California, in 1959. His father Carl F.
