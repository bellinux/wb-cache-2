25|$|The {{notion of}} a Noetherian ring is of {{fundamental}} importance in both commutative and noncommutative ring theory, due to the role it plays in simplifying the <b>ideal</b> <b>structure</b> of a ring. For instance, the ring of integers and the polynomial ring over a field are both Noetherian rings, and consequently, such theorems as the Lasker–Noether theorem, the Krull intersection theorem, and the Hilbert's basis theorem hold for them. Furthermore, if a ring is Noetherian, then it satisfies the descending chain condition on prime ideals. This property suggests a deep theory of dimension for Noetherian rings beginning {{with the notion of}} the Krull dimension.|$|E
25|$|Schelling {{held that}} the {{divisions}} imposed on nature, by our ordinary perception and thought, do not have absolute validity. They should be interpreted as {{the outcome of the}} single formative energy which is the soul or inner aspect of nature. In other words he was a proponent of a variety of organicism. The dynamic series of stages in nature, the forms in which the <b>ideal</b> <b>structure</b> of nature is realized, are matter, as the equilibrium of the fundamental expansive and contractive forces; light, with its subordinate processes (magnetism, electricity, and chemical action); organism, with its component phases of reproduction, irritability and sensibility. The continual change presented to us by experience, taken together with the thought of unity in productive force of nature, leads to the conception of the duality through which nature expresses itself in its varied products.|$|E

60|$|Applying {{this remark}} to physiology, {{we see that}} the nerves and brain as {{physical}} objects are not truly data; they are to be replaced, in the <b>ideal</b> <b>structure</b> of science, by the sensations through which the physiologist is said to perceive them. The passage from these sensations to nerves and brain as physical objects belongs really to the initial stage in the theory of physics, and ought to be placed in the reasoned part, not in the part supposed to be observed. To say we see the nerves is like saying we hear the nightingale; both are convenient but inaccurate expressions. We hear a sound which we believe to be causally connected with the nightingale, and we see a sight which we believe to be causally connected with a nerve. But in each case it is only the sensation that ought, in strictness, to be called a datum. Now, sensations are certainly among the data of psychology. Therefore all the data of the physical sciences are also psychological data. It remains to inquire whether all the data of psychology are also data of physical science, and especially of physiology.|$|E

40|$|In secret sharing, {{the exact}} {{characterization}} of <b>ideal</b> access <b>structures</b> is a longstanding open problem. Brickell and Davenport (J. of Cryptology, 1991) proved that <b>ideal</b> access <b>structures</b> are induced by matroids. Subsequently, <b>ideal</b> access <b>structures</b> and access structures induced by matroids have attracted {{a lot of}} attention. Due {{to the difficulty of}} finding general results, the characterization of <b>ideal</b> access <b>structures</b> has been studied for several particular families of access structures. In all these families, all the matroids that are related to access structures in the family are representable and, then, the matroid-related access structures coincide with the ideal ones. In this paper, we study the characterization of representable matroids. By using the well known connection between ideal secret sharing and matroids and, in particular, the recent results on <b>ideal</b> multipartite access <b>structures</b> and the connection between multipartite matroids and discrete polymatroids, we obtain a characterization of a family of representable multipartite matroids, which implies a sufficient condition for an access <b>structure</b> to be <b>ideal.</b> By using this result and further introducing the reduced discrete polymatroids, we provide a complete characterization of quadripartite representable matroids, which was until now an open problem, and hence, all access structures related to quadripartite representable matroids are the ideal ones. By the way, using our results, we give a new and simple proof that all access structures related to unipartite, bipartite and tripartite matroids coincide with the ideal ones...|$|R
