It was the first video for the album, so {{obviously}} everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what's to come. Rihanna and <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> in depth about creating a piece that was gritty, raw {{and more of a}} street video then a classic beauty piece... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip-hop videos that were made without a lot of resources, working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings, then trying to build and manipulate environments as we {{have done in the past}}... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side.|$|E

25|$|On the 1stofMay {{the city}} of New York has the {{appearance}} of sending off a population flying from the plague, or of a town which had surrendered on condition of carrying away all their goods and chattels. Rich furniture and ragged furniture, carts, wagons, and drays, ropes, canvas, and straw, packers, porters, and draymen, white, yellow, and black, occupy the streets from east to west, from north to south, on this day. Every one <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to on the subject complained of this custom as most annoying, but all assured me it was unavoidable, if you inhabit a rented house. More than one of my New York friends have built or bought houses solely to avoid this annual inconvenience.|$|E

It was such a splendid opportunity, anyhow, for breaking contracts, cutting salaries, and taming the stars.... Me, they gave the salary treatment. I could stay on without the raise my contract called for, or quit, [...] Schulberg said, using the questionable dodge of whether I'd be good for the talkies. Questionable, I say, because <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> decent English in a decent voice and came from the theater. So without hesitation I quit.|$|E
500|$|Planché {{was educated}} at home {{until the age}} of eight by his mother (who had written a {{treatise}} on education). He was then sent to boarding school where, in his words: [...] "I was imperfected, and untaught the French <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> fluently as a child." [...] In 1808 he was apprenticed to a French landscape painter, Monsieur de Court, however this was curtailed by the latter's death two years later. Planché was then articled as an apprentice to a bookseller, with the hope that this would also give him the opportunity to sell some of his own writings.|$|E

Pires also dismissed claims that Indjai was arrested suggesting that he was, in fact, a part of it (he was also involved in the 2010 military unrest before being appointed chief-of-staff).|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} built on a {{recreation}} of electronic musician Aphex Twin's piano composition [...] "Avril 14th". The song begins with a minute long introduction sung by Legend. [...] "Blame Game" [...] has a lush, cello-driven production with predominant piano. After Legend's introduction, West raps his verses in a highly melodic manner, almost singing his lines. West's forceful delivery expresses hurt and contempt. The song's soulful sound juxtaposes West's angry lyrics: [...] "been {{a long time since}} <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to you in a bathroom, ripping you up, fuckin' and chokin' you". He subsequently raps less antagonistically and repeatedly confesses [...] "I can't love you this much".|$|E
500|$|After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami had subsided, archaeologists {{discovered}} rock inscriptions {{which had}} been exposed by the tsunami waves close to the hamlet of Saluvankuppam, near the UNESCO-designated World Heritage Site of Mahabalipuram. The inscriptions by the Rashtrakuta king Krishna III and the Chola kings Parantaka I and Kulothunga Chola <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> of a Subrahmanya Temple at Thiruvizhchil (the present day Saluvanakuppam). S. Rajavelu, epigraphist with the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI), identified a nearby mound {{as the site of}} the temple. In 2005, archaeologists unearthed an 8th-century Pallava temple under the mound. G. Thirumoorthy, ASI Assistant Archaeologist, [...] believed that the shrine could be the oldest Murugan temple to be excavated in Tamil Nadu. There were speculations on whether the temple {{could be one of the}} [...] "Seven Pagodas".|$|E
500|$|Arensberg {{notes that}} Maya's rape is {{connected}} to the theme of death in Caged Bird, as Mr. Freeman threatens to kill Maya's brother Bailey if she tells anyone about the rape. After Maya lies during Freeman's trial, stating that the rape {{was the first time he}} touched her inappropriately, Freeman is murdered (presumably by one of Maya's uncles) and Maya sees her words as a bringer of death. As a result, she resolves never to speak to anyone other than Bailey. Angelou connects the violation of her body and the devaluation of her words through the depiction of her self-imposed, five-year-long silence. As Angelou later stated, [...] "I thought if <b>I</b> <b>spoke,</b> my mouth would just issue out something that would kill people, randomly, so it was better not to talk".|$|E

50|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that Carolino could not speak English, and that a French-English dictionary was used to translate an earlier Portuguese-French phrase book, O novo guia da conversação em francês e português, written by José da Fonseca. Carolino likely added Fonseca's name to the book without his permission {{in an attempt to}} give it some credibility. The Portuguese-French phrase book is apparently a competent work, without the defects that characterize English As She <b>Is</b> <b>Spoke.</b>|$|R

500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to. He helped me tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
500|$|McCartney asked Klein to {{dissolve}} the Beatles' partnership, but was refused. Exasperated, he took {{the case to the}} High Court in London in early 1971, naming Klein and the other Beatles as defendants. Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein's company, ABKCO, had caused [...] "intolerable interference" [...] by overdubbing [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by saying that when Spector had sent acetates of Let It Be to each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: [...] "We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to him on the phone, and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down." [...] Starr added: [...] "And then suddenly he didn't want it to go out. Two weeks after that, he wanted to cancel it." ...|$|E
500|$|DC officially retired {{the hero}} in the {{one-shot}} comic Batgirl Special #1 (July 1988), written by Barbara Kesel. Later that year, she appears in Alan Moore's Batman: The Killing Joke. In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon {{in an attempt to}} drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can be morally compromised. While the events in The Killing Joke exert a great impact on the character, the story {{has little to do with}} her. She is deployed as a plot device to cement the Joker’s vendetta against Commissioner Gordon and Batman. In 2006, during an interview with Wizard, Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character calling it [...] "shallow and ill-conceived". He stated prior to writing the graphic novel, [...] "I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon—who was Batgirl at the time—and if I remember, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project", and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, [...] "Len got back onto the phone and said, ‘Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.'" ...|$|E

500|$|By {{the end of}} May, Josh Brolin was {{revealed}} {{as the voice of}} Thanos, with Feige confirming in July that Brolin also provided the performance capture for the character. Thanos communicates via hologram for much of the film, though he does appear in a scene with Ronan and Nebula. In June 2014, Feige added that Thanos and his followers are [...] "the biggest piece of connective tissue that will eventually lead us back into Avengers films in the future." [...] On casting Brolin, Feige said, We reached out to him {{and it was one of}} those things that does not happen all the time but when it does it’s very nice, where he was totally intrigued. He was a fan of what we did, he met with Jeremy Latcham in a hotel in London and learned about the characters a little bit. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to him on the phone a few times. We ran it by James who loved it, ran it by Joss [...] who loved it because Thanos is in this universe because of Avengers. Then we shot him and recorded for it.|$|E
500|$|On 20 August 2009, Villa {{scored in}} his first {{official}} match of the season, a 3–0 Europa League qualifier against Stabæk. He followed this up with two goals against Real Valladolid on 13 September, Villa's first league goals of the 2009–10 season. He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right. We relaxed and ended up with the same result as last year. What has happened, has happened, but their goalkeeper was good, unlike our approach, which was not good," [...] however a day later he denied being critical of Emery, pointing out that, [...] "When I talked about the approach, I was referring to the whole team, <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> {{in the heat of the}} moment, I was annoyed at the way we lost two points and I said what I thought, but I have clarified everything that needed to be cleared up." ...|$|E

It's wishful and imparts the idea that, 'I'm here and I'm watching you take your steps forward and I'm supporting your independence, {{but at the same}} time, I don't want you to make mistakes.' Any parent can relate to that." [...] The song is followed by Eddie Vedder's acoustic ballad [...] "Skipping", which he wrote as a tribute to his children and features his daughter Olivia's (age 6) voice {{at the start of the}} track, saying [...] "check, check" [...] and [...] "daddy, daddy". Turlington said of Vedder's involvement: Eddie was amazing to accept this project while in the midst of so much. <b>I</b> <b>spoke</b> to him and exchanged several emails about his contribution. [...] "Skipping" [...] is such a sweet song and I just love that his daughter Olivia has a little cameo at the start. He once wrote me saying that his girls would be proud one day that their dad contributed to such a meaningful project.|$|E
