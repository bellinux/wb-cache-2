5|$|In addition, most {{researchers}} have speculated {{as to why}} Sydney {{was so close to}} an unknown vessel, with various levels of blame assigned to Captain Burnett for the demise of his ship. Theories to explain Burnett's actions include that he was inexperienced or incompetent, deceived by Kormorans disguise, the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> under conflicting orders instructing that raiders be attacked at range but enemy supply ships be captured, or {{that he was trying to}} clearly identify the merchantman.|$|E

Von Fölkersam, ill with cancer, died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet {{in order to keep}} morale up. The captain of Oslyabya became the commander of the 2nd Division while Nebogatov had no <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> now the squadron's de facto second-in-command.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} whether the year of Hamilton's birth was 1755 or 1757. Most {{historical}} evidence after Hamilton's arrival in North America supports the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> born in 1757, including Hamilton's own writings. Hamilton listed his birth year as 1757 when he first arrived in the Thirteen Colonies, and celebrated his birthday on January 11. In later life, he tended to give his age only in round figures. Historians accepted 1757 as his birth year until about 1930, when additional documentation of his early life in the Caribbean was published, initially in Danish. A probate paper from St. Croix in 1768, drafted {{after the death of}} Hamilton's mother, listed him as 13 years old, which has caused some historians since the 1930s to favor a birth year of 1755.|$|E
5000|$|Strummer {{had been}} {{developing}} {{a set of}} lyrical <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> looking to match with an appropriate tune. Before hearing Headon's music, Strummer had already {{come up with the}} phrases [...] "rock the casbah" [...] and [...] "you'll have to let that raga drop" [...] as lyrical <b>ideas</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> considering for future songs. After hearing Headon's music, Strummer went into the studio's toilets and wrote lyrics to match the song's melody.|$|R

25|$|Many {{of these}} {{challenges}} were arranged with local merchants {{in one of}} the first uses of mass tie-in marketing. Rather than promote the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> assisted by spirits, as did the Davenport Brothers and others, Houdini's advertisements showed him making his escapes via dematerializing, although Houdini himself never claimed to have supernatural powers.|$|E
25|$|With a {{group of}} friends, he {{designed}} and sailed a boat on the Danube, from Tulcea to the Black Sea. In parallel, Eliade grew estranged from the educational environment, becoming disenchanted with the discipline required and obsessed with the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> uglier and less virile than his colleagues. In order to cultivate his willpower, he would force himself to swallow insects and only slept four to five hours a night. At one point, Eliade was failing four subjects, among which was {{the study of the}} Romanian language.|$|E
25|$|Milroy, {{despite the}} engagements up to point, {{still had no}} <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> facing the entire Second Corps of Lee's Army. Milroy {{concentrated}} all of his forces in the three forts defending the town. Having feared exactly this type of a scenario, General-in-chief Henry W. Halleck had asked Schenck to order Milroy to fall back from Winchester to Harpers Ferry. Although Schenck had discussed evacuation with Milroy, he left no clear direction for Milroy to evacuate, since Milroy had convinced Schenck that his defensive position in Winchester was strong. Milroy had previously decided to disregard concerns from Washington because he was confident that {{the strength of his}} fortifications would allow his garrison to withstand an assault or a siege.|$|E

500|$|Crowley's {{theological}} beliefs {{were not}} clear. The historian Ronald Hutton {{noted that some}} of Crowley's writings {{could be used to}} argue that he was an atheist, while some support the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a polytheist, and others would bolster the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a mystical monotheist. On the basis of the teachings in The Book of the Law, Crowley described a pantheon of three deities taken from the ancient Egyptian pantheon: Nuit, Hadit, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit. In 1928, he made the claim that all [...] "true" [...] deities were [...] "derived" [...] from this trinity.|$|E
500|$|En route, Rozhestvensky reorganized his ships {{into three}} {{tactical}} divisions for the forthcoming battle; the first {{consisted of the}} four new s commanded by himself, von Fölkersam commanded the Second Division that consisted of the battleships Oslyabya, , [...] and the armored cruiser , and Nebogatov retained his ships as the Third Division. Von Fölkersam, ill with cancer, died on 26 May and Rozhestvensky decided not to inform the fleet {{in order to keep}} morale up. Oslyabyas Captain 1st Rank Vladimir Ber became the commander of the Second Division, while Nebogatov had no <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> now the squadron's de facto second-in-command.|$|E
500|$|For the episode's {{time travel}} elements, sound effects editor Bruce Tanis {{explained}} his choices of sound {{during an interview}} with Designing Sound: [...] "I used vocals from the dialog to create high-pitched jittery tones that played against the visual of his time-jumping. He would start to flicker faster and faster as he ramped up to the moment of leaping so I wanted to play up the fragmented sense of time we had visually and create the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> somehow jumping over other people to land at a different point in time. It also had electrical humming and zapping to support the electrical nature of the device".|$|E

500|$|Hutton's {{assessment}} {{was shared by}} historian Owen Davies; {{in his study of}} English cunning-folk, he described Liddell's stories as [...] "seductive but entirely unsubstantiated". Instead, he maintained that Pickingill was [...] "a simple rural cunning-man whose small world of village affairs never crossed with that of middle-class occultists. He received a Christian burial and the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a pagan priest would probably make him turn in his grave." [...] While agreeing with Maple's assessment that Pickingill was [...] "one of the last practising cunning-folk in the country", Maple noted that—unlike Murrell, James Tuckett, John Wrightson, and William Brewer—Pickingill was not a [...] "major regional figure" [...] in the profession.|$|E
500|$|Timmons wrote [...] "a {{steady stream}} of {{infectious}} funky tunes", stated Giddins. Timmons dismissed the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> deliberately a composer: [...] "I'm a dilettante as a composer. I have never consciously sat down and tried to write a song." [...] He stated that his method of composing a new song might involve [...] "whistling, playing around with the notes, or at a club. I'll tell one musician to play this note, another that note, and we kick it around." [...] One account {{of the creation of}} [...] "Moanin'" [...] was given by Golson: Timmons had the opening eight bars, which he often played between tunes, but formed the complete song only after Golson encouraged him to add a bridge.|$|E
500|$|Ion Creangă's {{sense of}} humor was {{instrumental}} in forging the unprecedented characteristics of his work. American critic Ruth S. Lamb, the writer's style merges [...] "the rich vocabulary of the Moldavian peasant" [...] with [...] "an original gaiety and gusto {{comparable to that of}} Rabelais." [...] According to George Călinescu: [...] " [...] got the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a clever man, like all men of the people, and therefore used irony to make himself seem stupid." [...] In Călinescu's view, the author's antics had earned him a status equivalent to that of his Wallachian Junimist counterpart Caragiale, with the exception that the latter found his inspiration in urban settings, matching [...] "Nasreddinisms" [...] with [...] "Miticism". Z. Ornea sees the main protagonists in Creangă's comedic narratives as, in effect, [...] "particularized incarnations of the same symbolic character", while the use of humor itself reflects the traditional mindset, [...] "a survival through intelligence, that of a people with an old history, whose life experience has for centuries been concentrated into gestures and words." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the final}} section of the poem, Prufrock rejects the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> Prince Hamlet, {{suggesting}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> merely [...] "an attendant lord" [...] (112) whose purpose is to [...] "advise the prince" [...] (114), a likely allusion to Polonius — Polonius being also [...] "almost, at times, the Fool." ...|$|R

2500|$|Shrewsbury was {{considered}} quite a slow scoring batsman, but C. B. Fry described his play thus: [...] "The <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>is</b> slow <b>is</b> mistaken. True, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> often {{half an hour}} without scoring; but somehow he makes up for it and is all but even with his more mobile partner. The fact <b>is</b> <b>he</b> waits for the ball he wants, and then secures a certain fourer. He does not waste time and energy in banging ball after ball into fieldsman's hands." ...|$|R
500|$|Mark O'Hare {{directed}} and animated the walk cycles {{in the beginning}} of the episode. The cycle originated when supervising producer at the time Derek Drymon called O'Hare. O'Hare said [...] "Derek would call me out of the blue for freelance, and it was tough to know the context of stuff." [...] He remembered the crew gave him a [...] "bad" [...] synthesizer song and he was told to do [...] "some kind of weird walk to it." [...] He said [...] "I animated this bizarre SpongeBob walk and turned it in, and that was that." [...] Eventually, Drymon saw the cycle and referred to it as [...] "The Lost Episode" [...] walk. O'Hare had no idea what Drymon was talking about until he learned it was already used in an episode. O'Hare said [...] "so I just figured that it ended up on the cutting room floor, like a lot of stuff you end up doing in animation. I had no <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> referring to the actual name of the show [...]" [...] The live action scenes were directed by Mark Osborne (brother of the episode's storyboard director Kent Osborne), and were hosted by Tom Kenny in character as Patchy the Pirate, the president of the fictional SpongeBob SquarePants fan club.|$|E
500|$|The ending {{sequence}} with Pam and Jim in {{the hospital}} was filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center using the Sacred Heart Hospital set from Scrubs. Although the good news Jim and Pam learn {{in the hospital}} was never specifically stated, episode writer Jen Celotta confirmed that the news was that Pam was pregnant; the script included an off-hand question from a nurse to Pam about whether she was pregnant so that viewers would make the connection later. Celotta said {{the idea of the}} pregnancy came as the writers were working on this specific episode, although she felt the show had always been heading in that direction. The series producers considered filming the scene with audible dialogue, but they thought the scene was more powerful without audio and felt actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer [...] "are such great actors and have the ability to convey so much without hearing their dialogue." [...] Celotta said the show's producers have no plans to release the scene with audio. While filming Jim Halpert's emotional reaction to the pregnancy news, Krasinski and director Ken Kwapis discussed the fact that Jim has been surrounded by this camera crew for the last five years, so he would be glad to share this moment with them. The moment when Jim looked directly at the camera, in particular, was meant to convey the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> celebrating the news with the crew. The script did not call for tears, but Krasinski cried naturally as part of his performance.|$|E
2500|$|.....soon {{became the}} idol of the regiment. A {{thorough}} tactician, with the bearing of a courageous soldier, he impressed {{the men with}} the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a leader it was an honor to follow. No order of his was ever questioned, much less disobeyed, because every man in his command believed that the colonel could not make a mistake and always meant what he said.|$|E

When a fight occurs between an Eleusinian and Athenian boy, Theseus stops it and realizes he must do something. He becomes king of the victims, and makes them swear an oath {{that they will be}} together, not Minyans or Hellenes, but one group. They call {{themselves}} the Cranes. One of the girls, Helike, is a tumbler, and can dance very well.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of his most famous works, he {{attracted}} many uncritical hangers-on, but many others who sought him found him aloof and even dull. With his soft voice, he was sometimes shouted down or excluded from discussions. At this time, he was severely ill; it was wartime or the austerity period after it; during the war his wife suffered from depression; and after her death he was lonely and unhappy. In addition to that, he always lived frugally and seemed unable to care for himself properly. As a result of all this, people found his circumstances bleak. Some, like Michael Ayrton, called him [...] "Gloomy George," [...] but others developed the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "secular saint." ...|$|E
2500|$|When Superboy {{arrived in}} Metropolis, {{he used the}} name [...] "Superman". While glibly asserting he was the {{original}} Superman, he quickly rebuked any insinuation he was the original Superman. In fact, he told anyone who'd listen {{that he was a}} clone of Superman. This revelation was first revealed to Lois Lane, but she was not interested. This prompts the Kid to turn to another reporter, Tana Moon, who breaks the story live on WGBS. Three other Supermen emerged simultaneously: [...] "The Man of Tomorrow" [...] (the Cyborg Superman), [...] "The Last Son of Krypton" [...] (the Eradicator), and [...] "The Man of Steel" [...] (Steel). After the original Superman's return, Superboy began operating alongside him as an independent hero for a time, refusing to give credence to the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> a [...] "sidekick" [...] of Superman's.|$|E
2500|$|Lowell {{suffered}} from manic depression and was hospitalized many times throughout {{his adult life}} for this mental illness. On multiple occasions, Lowell {{was admitted to the}} famous psychiatric hospital, McLean Hospital, in Belmont, Massachusetts, and one of his poems, [...] "Waking in the Blue" [...] references his stay there. Although Lowell's manic depression was often a great burden (for himself and his family), the subject of that mental illness led to some of his most important poetry, particularly as it manifested itself in his book Life Studies. When he was fifty, Lowell began taking lithium to treat his mental illness. Saskia Hamilton, the editor of Lowell's Letters, notes, [...] "Lithium treatment relieved him from suffering the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> morally and emotionally responsible for the fact that he relapsed. However, it did not entirely prevent relapses ... And he was troubled and anxious about the impact of his relapses on his family and friends until the end of his life." ...|$|E
