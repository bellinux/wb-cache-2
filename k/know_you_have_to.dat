2500|$|Johnson {{attempted}} in vain {{to capitalize}} on Kennedy's youth, poor health, and failure {{to take a position}} regarding Joseph McCarthy. He had formed a [...] "Stop Kennedy" [...] coalition with Adlai Stevenson, Stuart Symington, and Hubert Humphrey, but it proved a failure. Johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the Democratic convention, which nominated John F. Kennedy. Tip O'Neill was a representative from Kennedy's home state of Massachusetts at that time, and he recalled that Johnson approached him at the convention and said, [...] "Tip, I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> support Kennedy at the start, but I'd like to have you with me on the second ballot." [...] O'Neill replied, [...] "Senator, there's {{not going to be any}} second ballot." ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Oh Lord Lambeth, {{wait till}} the great heat’s over!” Mr. Westgate interposed. “Boston in this weather would be very trying; it’s not the {{temperature}} for intellectual exertion.

6000|$|... "Oh yes; that!" [...] she returned. [...] "But you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> take it. You can't let {{the money}} lie idle: {{that would be}} ridiculous; and then, with the good purpose we have in view, it is our duty to take the interest. How should we keep up the school, and pay the teachers, and everything?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Charmian gave a shout of laughter. [...] "I wish we were. Then I {{could be}} natural. But I mean, {{what are you}} going to be: very gentle and mild and sweet and shrinking; or very {{philosophical}} and thoughtful; or very stately and cold and remote?

6000|$|We {{had drifted}} {{into a little}} bay, under shelter of a high rocky point. I felt a sudden access of insane boldness, and taking both Ida's hands in mine, I ventured to kiss her open forehead. She took the kiss quietly, but with a certain queenly sense of homage due.

60|$|Well, I wasn't {{going to}} have any of that sort of thing, by Jove! I'd seen so many cases of fellows who had become perfect slaves to their valets. I {{remember}} poor old Aubrey Fothergill telling me--with absolute tears in his eyes, poor chap!--one night at the club, that he had been compelled to give up a favourite pair of brown shoes simply because Meekyn, his man, disapproved of them. You have to keep these fellows in their place, don't you <b>know.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> work the good old iron-hand-in-the-velvet-glove wheeze.

All that’s missing from the director’s new {{vision of the world}} is the pipe organ and the choir of angels." ...|$|E
50|$|It was Storm's second feature, {{following}} his debut with 27A and after an unsuccessful {{attempt to make}} another movie called Angel Gear.I became aware that all the films being made in Australia were period films, Picnic at Hanging Rock, The Getting of Wisdom, Between Wars. I felt this reflected a society that was unable {{to come to terms}} with where it was at. I <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> look into the past and find your heroes but it seemed to me that it was reflective of a desire not to face up to where we were at. That also coincided with where I was at personally in my relationship to women and to Haydn collaborator Haydn Keenan, so I thought I should make a film about leaving the past behind and coming to terms with the present, moving into the future with a positive attitude. That's what I thought I should do personally and that's what I felt Australia should do. It led to In Search of Anna.|$|E
5000|$|Tom Cruise has {{distributed}} The Way to Happiness pamphlets, {{and passed}} out brochures embossed with his name {{at the elementary school}} where the 2005 movie War of the Worlds was filmed.

In a Church of Scientology-produced promotional video which appeared on YouTube in January 2008, Cruise cites [...] "the way to happiness" [...] as {{one of the benefits of}} Scientology: [...] "When you're a Scientologist and you drive by an accident, you <b>know</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do something about it, because you know you're the only one who can really help," [...] said Cruise. [...] "We are the way to happiness. We can bring peace and unite cultures." [...] Actor Miles Fisher parodies this quote by Cruise, in a scene in the 2008 film Superhero Movie. Fisher's character in the film states that he can [...] "eat planets" [...] and that he is [...] "the way to happiness".|$|E
