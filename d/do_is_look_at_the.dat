5000|$|It is in {{some ways}} {{difficult}} to gauge the difference in athletic performance. In racing sports, such as cross country and track & field, it is simple because all one has to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> individual and team standings. In sports where only two teams play each other, it is more difficult. Massey Ratings does attempt to rank college teams across NCAA Divisions. As of November 19, 2013, NCAA Division III had 448 members, and the Massey Ratings had over 100 Division III men's basketball teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's basketball had 88 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's tennis had over 170 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's soccer had over 300 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] Women's volleyball had over 300 Division III teams ranked among Division I teams. [...] These are the fall sports where only two teams play each other at a time, and where over 300 members of each Division field teams. In all of these rankings, the top teams were Division I teams. While these rankings are in constant states of flux as the seasons progress, they are typical of the substantial overlap between the Divisions, with the top teams being Division I teams.|$|E

50|$|Another {{thing she}} <b>does</b> <b>is</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> bones at her Neolithic sites {{to see what}} the people at those sites were eating. Looking at the bones that are {{represented}} at a site can help the archaeologist determine what kind of site they have; whether it is a butchery site or a habitation site. Marshall <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the bones that were discovered at Ngamuriak, Kenya, which were almost all from the domesticated cattle, sheep, and Goats that the pastoralists had when they inhabited this site. Marshall found that of the bones found in her site, the cattle long bones were typically broken. Her theory is that these bones were broken in order to get at what was in the center of them: bone grease. Bone grease is used for cooking and it comes from the inside the bone like bone marrow. This idea is supported by the fracture patterns that Marshall observed on this bones.|$|R
