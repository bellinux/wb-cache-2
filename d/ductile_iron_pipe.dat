5000|$|<b>Ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> in the {{developed}} world is normally manufactured exclusively from recycled material including scrap steel and recycled iron. The pipe can be recycled after use. In terms of environmental impact, several studies have compared ductile iron pipe's impact on the environment with that of other pipe materials. A study by Jeschar et al. in 1995 compared the energy use and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced in manufacturing pipes of various materials including concrete, ductile iron, cast iron and PVC, based on pipes with nominal diameter of 100mm to 500mm. The energy consumed in manufacturing <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> was 19.55 MJ per kg and volume of emissions released during manufacture was 1.430 kg CO2 per kg, compared to 68.30 MJ per kg of energy and 4.860 kg CO2 per kg emissions for PVC pipes, and 1.24 MJ per kg and 0.148 kg CO2 per kg for concrete pipes of the same diameter. Another study the following year, by the Forschungsinstitut für Chemie und Umwelt, had similar findings. However, it also took the lifetime of pipes into account. This study found improved environmental performance for <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> in terms of energy consumed and emissions produced during manufacture due to its longer life span. A more recent study, published August 2012, by Du et al., carried out a life cycle analysis on six types materials used for water and waste water pipes, including ductile iron, PVC, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and concrete. They found that at diameters of ≤ 24 in, <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> had the highest [...] "global warming potential" [...] based on emissions from manufacturing, transportation and installation. At larger diameters, ≥ 30 in, <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> had a lower [...] "global warming potential", while PVC had the highest. According to a 2008 study by Koo et al., <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> had the lowest impact on natural resource depletion, compared to HDPE pipe and PVC pipe. [...] In November 2012, <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> manufactured in the United States received certification as a sustainable product from the Institute for Market Transformation to Sustainability.|$|E

Should a building move from its foundation or fall due to cripple wall collapse, the <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> transporting the gas within the structure may be broken, typically {{at the location of}} threaded joints.

50|$|Subsequent to its {{invention}} by Dimitri Sensaud deLavaud, a French-Brazilian, in 1918, much {{cast iron}} pipe manufacturing shifted to the dramatically different technique of centrifugal casting.

50|$|There {{are three}} {{processes}} for metallic pipe manufacture. Centrifugal casting of hot alloyed metal {{is one of}} the most prominent process. <b>Ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> are generally manufactured in such a fashion. Seamless (SMLS) pipe is formed by drawing a solid billet over a piercing rod to create the hollow shell. As the manufacturing process does not include any welding, seamless pipes are perceived to be stronger and more reliable. Historically, seamless pipe was regarded as withstanding pressure better than other types, and was often more available than welded pipe.|$|R
50|$|The driven <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> pile is a simple, {{fast and}} highly {{effective}} pile system.

TRM piles are a pre-fabricated driven pile system utilizing high strength <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> which are manufactured using a spun-cast process having outside diameters of 118 and 170 mm. The standard pile lengths are 5,0 m long. The pipes are manufactured with a tapered socket with an internal shoulder for full engagement at top and a tapered spigot at the bottom. The individual pile sections can be connected with this Plug and Drive® connection to drive a pile of any length.|$|R

50|$|Zinc {{coatings}} {{are generally}} not employed in the U.S. In order to protect <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipe</b> prior to installation, pipe is instead supplied with a temporary 1 mil or 25 µm thick bituminous coating.

40|$|Soil {{corrosivity}} {{is not a}} directly measurable parameter and pipe corrosion {{is largely}} a random phenomenon. The literature is replete with methods and systems that attempts to predict soil corrosivity and resulting metallic pipe corrosion from soil properties (e. g., resistivity, pH, redox potential and others) surrounding the pipe. This paper describes research that endeavors to gain {{a thorough understanding of}} the geometry of external corrosion pits and the factors (e. g., soil properties, appurtenances, service connections, etc.) that influence this geometry. This understanding would lead to the ultimate objective of achieving a better ability to assess the remaining life of <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> for a given set of circumstances. Varying lengths of <b>ductile</b> <b>iron</b> <b>pipes</b> were exhumed by several North American and Australian water utilities. The exhumed pipes were cut into sections, sandblasted and tagged. Soil samples extracted along the exhumed pipe were also provided. Pipe segments were scanned, using a specially developed laser scanner. Scanned data were processed using specially developed software. Statistical analyses were performed on three geometrical attributes, namely pit depth, pit area and pit volume. Various soil characteristics were investigated for their impact on the geometric properties of the corrosion pits. Preliminary findings indicate that the data not always support traditional conventions.
