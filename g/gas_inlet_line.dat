40|$|Upgrading of the {{experimental}} apparatus was necessitated by problems encountered in the previous scoping runs with CH{sub 4 }/MgO. To further improve plasma stability, a pressure controller was installed on the cooling chamber to maintain the chamber pressure constant at 1 atm and a mass flow controller was installed on the main plasma <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>line.</b> With a fully functional data acquisition and control system, there is now the capability to record arc voltage, arc current, chamber pressure, feed gas mass flow, and cooling water and gas temperatures during the relatively short experimental runs. With this system, an improved sampling protocol can also be implemented whereby gas and solid sampling are initiated only when fully developed flowrates of methane and MgO are established in the plasma. Solid products from a scoping run under conditions of excess MgO above the stoichiometric requirement for 100 % conversion of the methane exhibited intense reactivity in the open atmosphere, indicating high concentrations of magnesium carbide in the product. The hypothesis is that reaction begins with hydrolysis of the carbide by atmospheric moisture giving acetylene and/or methylacetylene which then, because of the intense local heating (possibly due to the fine particle sizes of the recently formed carbides), are ignited to produce flaming combustion...|$|E
40|$|The Next Generation Nuclear Power (NGNP) Fuel Development and Qualification Program {{included}} the design, installation, {{and testing of}} a 6 -inch diameter nuclear fuel particle coater to demonstrate quality TRISO fuel production on a small industrial scale. Scale-up from the laboratory-scale coater faced challenges associated {{with an increase in}} the kernel charge mass, kernel diameter, and a redesign of the gas distributor to achieve adequate fluidization throughout the deposition of the four TRISO coating layers. TRISO coatings are applied at very high temperatures in atmospheres of dense particulate clouds, corrosive gases, and hydrogen concentrations over 45 % by volume. The severe environment, stringent product and process requirements, and the fragility of partially-formed coatings limit the insertion of probes or instruments into the coater vessel during operation. Pressure instrumentation were installed on the <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> and exhaust line of the 6 -inch coater to monitor the bed differential pressure and internal pressure fluctuations emanating from the fuel bed as a result of bed and gas “bubble” movement. These instruments are external to the particle bed and provide a glimpse into the dynamics of fuel particle bed during the coating process and data {{that could be used to}} help ascertain the adequacy of fluidization and, potentially, the dominant fluidization regimes. Pressure fluctuation and differential pressure data are not presently useful as process control instruments, but data suggest a link between the pressure signal structure and some measurable product attributes that could be exploited to get an early estimate of the attribute values...|$|E
40|$|The Liquid Phase Methanol (LPMEOHTM) Demonstration Project at Kingsport, Tennessee, is a $ 213. 7 million {{cooperative}} {{agreement between}} the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and Air Products Liquid Phase Conversion Company, L. P. (the Partnership). Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (Air Products) and Eastman Chemical Company (Eastman) formed the Partnership to execute the Demonstration Project. The LPMEOIYM Process Demonstration Unit was built at a site located at the Eastman complex in Kingsport. During this quarter, comments from the DOE on the Topical Report "Economic Analysis - LPMEOHTM Process as an Add-on to IGCC for Coproduction" were received. A recommendation to continue with design verification testing for the coproduction of dimethyl ether (DIME) and methanol was made. DME design verification testing studies show the liquid phase DME (LPDME) process will have a significant economic advantage for the coproduction of DME for local markets. An LPDME catalyst system with reasonable long-term activity and stability is being developed. A recommendation document summarizing catalyst targets, experimental results, and the corresponding economics for a commercially successful LPDME catalyst was issued on 30 June 1997. The off-site, product-use test plan was updated in June of 1997. During this quarter, Acurex Environmental Corporation and Air Products screened proposals for this task by {{the likelihood of the}} projects to proceed and the timing for the initial methanol requirement. Eight sites from the list have met these criteria. The formal submission of the eight projects for review and concurrence by the DOE will be made during the next reporting period. The site paving and final painting were completed in May of 1997. Start-up activities were completed during the reporting period, and the initial methanol production from the demonstration unit occurred on 02 April 1997. The first extended stable operation at the nameplate capacity of 80, 000 gallons per day (260 tons per day) took place on 06 April 1997. Pressure drop and resistance coefficient across the gas sparger {{at the bottom of the}} reactor increased over this initial operating period. The demonstration unit was shut down from 08 May - 17 June 1997 as part of a scheduled complex outage for the Kingsport site. During this outage, the gas sparger was removed, cleaned, and reinstalled. After completion of other maintenance activities, the demonstration unit was restarted, and maintained stable operation through the remainder of the reporting period. Again, the gas sparger showed an increase in pressure drop and resistance since the restart, although not as rapidly as during the April-May operation. Fresh oil was introduced online for the first time to a new flush connection on the <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> <b>line</b> to the reactov the flush lowered the pressure drop by 1 psi. However, the effects were temporary, and the sparger resistance coefficient continued to increase.

40|$|The water {{dynamics}} of the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) of a 50 cm 2 polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cell was studied in response to current and humidity step transients {{as a function of}} inlet relative humidity (RH) and cell operating temperature. MEA water content change was monitored by high frequency resistance (HFR) and in situ neutron imaging. The MEA “wetting ” response was significantly faster (10 - 30 seconds) than the reciprocal “drying ” response (several minutes). The wetting response to increasing current appears faster than that to increasing <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> RH. Wetting and drying responses to <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> RH transients are greater at low current densities showing the dominating effect of current wetting over <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> humidity effects. Operating the fuel cell at 40 oC with no <b>inlet</b> <b>gas</b> humidification, a current wetting response was observed and 34 amps of current sustained. This showed that reaction water produced at the cathode is sufficient to support high current density if the drying effect of <b>inlet</b> <b>gases</b> is low. It also suggests that back diffusion of reaction water to the MEA is sufficient to account for the fast drop in HFR. In situ neutron imaging results show that GDL wetting is also faster than drying but on a slower time scale than that for the MEA.

40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{different}} <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> modifications for a horizontal single-wafer MOVPE reactor were studied: the conventional one ensured gas mixing of groups III and V precursors by forcibly merging both gases in a gas mixing unit, the newer one allowed mixing of groups III and V precursors solely by diffusion after the separation plate. AlAs/ GaAs Bragg reflector structures were deposited in nitrogen atmosphere for both <b>gas</b> <b>inlet</b> types and the uniformity determined by X-ray diffraction. Three-dimensional detailed numerical modeling {{was employed to}} explain the results. They establish that the observed strong non-uniformity of growth for the new inlet {{as well as the}} unusual concave instead of the common convex growth profile found is due to the incomplete mixing of precursor gases in a highly dense gas phase. By adjusting the groups III/V gas stream ratio an effect could be taken on the diffusion processes. Furthermore the total flow in the reactor was optimized for the new <b>gas</b> <b>inlet.</b> By taking advantage of changed diffusion properties in nitrogen atmosphere, however, perfect uniformity with an absolute deviation smaller than 1 % was obtained.
