5|$|A {{hardy and}} {{versatile}} garden plant, B.integrifolia is widely planted in Australian gardens. It {{is a popular}} choice for parks and streetscapes, and {{has been used for}} bush revegetation and stabilisation of dunes. Its hardiness <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> research into its suitability for use as a rootstock in the cut flower trade, but has also caused concerns about its potential to become a weed outside its natural habitat.|$|E

5|$|Despite Hong Kong's {{reputation}} of being intensely urbanised, the territory has tried to promote a green environment, and recent growing public concern <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> the severe restriction of further land reclamation from Victoria Harbour. Awareness of the environment is growing as Hong Kong suffers from increasing pollution compounded by its geography and tall buildings. Approximately 80% of the city's smog originates {{from other parts of}} the Pearl River Delta.|$|E
5|$|Films {{released}} {{during the}} dump months {{have not always}} been consigned to cinematic oblivion. Some, like Tremors and Office Space, have become cult classics. Starting with Cloverfield, some 21st-century dump-months releases have managed to exceed $100 million on box office receipts. The similar success of low-budget horror films like The Devil Inside and Mama in the early 2010s <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> studios to release films in that genre at times of the year other than Halloween and the dump months.|$|E
5|$|Scientists {{are seeing}} far greater {{variability}} in the prototypes than previously believed. The increasing divergence in the masses of the world's prototypes and the short-term instability in the IPK <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> research into improved methods to obtain a smooth surface finish using diamond turning on newly manufactured replicas and has intensified {{the search for a}} new definition of the kilogram.

5|$|The {{character}} has been well-received by critics, with Ellie's relationship with Joel most frequently {{the subject of}} praise. The strength and complexity of her character, and its subversion of the damsel in distress stereotype, have also been commended. Ellie's role in Left Behinds plot <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> some social commentary within the industry, with coverage focusing on a scene depicting LGBT themes. Both the character and Johnson's performance received numerous awards and nominations, and have regularly been placed favorably in polls and lists.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} {{had major}} implications {{for a large}} segment of the population, economy, and politics of the entire United States. It <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> a Congressional review of the Army Corps of Engineers and the failure of portions of the federally built flood protection system which experts agree should have protected the city's inhabitants from Katrina's surge. Katrina has also stimulated significant research in the academic community into urban planning, real estate finance, and economic issues in the wake of a natural disaster.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the Hurricane Protection Project of New Orleans <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> many {{government}} officials to call for many congressional committee hearings and investigations.

In 2012, the university president brought back the Hurons logo, which was placed inside flap a of the band uniforms, along with another historic logo, with the stated intent of recognizing the past. However, {{the return of the}} Hurons logo <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> protests from Native Americans at the university and in the local community, who state that the old mascot promotes stereotypes and hostility.|$|E
5|$|Angry Birds is {{a casual}} puzzle video game {{developed}} by Rovio Entertainment. Inspired primarily by {{a sketch of}} stylized wingless birds, the game was first released for iOS and Maemo devices in December 2009. Since that time, over 12 million copies of the game have been purchased from the iOS App Store, which <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> the company to design versions for other touchscreen-based smartphones, most notably those using the Android, Symbian, Windows Phone and BlackBerry 10 devices. The series has since expanded to include titles for dedicated video game consoles and for PCs. A sequel, titled Angry Birds 2, was released in July 2015.|$|E
5|$|Between 1927 and 1953, Route 83 {{was a part}} of Route 49, which {{originally}} ran {{south of}} Millville along Route 47 between Millville and South Dennis and along the entire length of Route 83. In 1953, the route became Route 83 when Route 49 was realigned to follow what was then Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe and Route 47 was aligned to follow Route S49 between South Dennis and Wildwood. In 2007, the state completed reconstruction of the intersection with Route 47 to include a traffic signal. A school bus accident <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to install a traffic signal at the Y intersection of Route 83 and US 9.|$|E

5|$|Despite ongoing {{efforts by}} the Ministry of Domestic Security, crime has worsened in Antananarivo since 2009. Between 1994 and 1998, the city {{had an average of}} eight to twelve police {{officers}} for every 10,000 inhabitants; large cities should typically have closer to fifteen. Under the mayorship of Marc Ravalomanana (1998–2001), street lights were installed or repaired throughout the city to improve night-time safety. He increased the number of police officers on the streets, leading to a drop in crime. , the city lacks a comprehensive strategy for reducing crime. The recent increase in crime and the inadequate response from the CUA <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> the growth of private security firms in the city.|$|E
5|$|Diamond {{writes that}} jury {{consultants}} then compare the three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E
5|$|European {{banks are}} {{estimated}} to have incurred losses approaching €1 trillion between {{the outbreak of the}} financial crisis in 2007 and 2010. The European Commission approved some €4.5 trillion in state aid for banks between October 2008 and October 2011, a sum which includes the value of taxpayer-funded recapitalisations and public guarantees on banking debts. This <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> some economists such as Joseph Stiglitz and Paul Krugman to note that Europe is not suffering from a sovereign debt crisis but rather from a banking crisis.|$|E

5|$|In the Sauternes region, {{the grape}} is blended with Sémillon {{to make the}} late harvest wine, Sauternes. The {{composition}} of Sauvignon blanc varies from producer and can range from 5-50% with the Premier Cru Supérieur Château d'Yquem using 20%. A traditional practice often employed in Sauternes is to plant one Sauvignon Blanc vine at regular intervals among rows of Sémillon. However, Sauvignon blanc's propensity to ripen 1–2 weeks earlier can lead the grapes to lose some of their intensity and aroma as they hang longer on the vine. This <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> more producers to isolate their parcels of Sauvignon blanc.|$|E
5|$|It was {{followed}} by almost four decades of international peace in Europe. No further major conflict occurred until the Crimean War. Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included {{the formation of the}} Holy Alliance of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former Holy Roman Empire into a German Confederation increasingly marked by the political dominance of Prussia. The bicentenary of Waterloo <b>has</b> <b>prompted</b> renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.|$|E
