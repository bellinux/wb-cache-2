500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies {{are used}} to {{represent}} the function of a mechanical system as an equivalent electrical system by drawing analogies between mechanical and electrical parameters. [...] A mechanical system by itself can be so represented, but analogies are of greatest use in electromechanical systems {{where there is a}} connection between mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>parts.</b> [...] Analogies are especially useful in analysing mechanical filters. [...] These are filters constructed of mechanical parts but designed to work in an electrical circuit through transducers. [...] Circuit theory is well developed in the electrical domain in general and in particular there is a wealth of filter theory available. [...] Mechanical systems can make use of this electrical theory in mechanical designs through a mechanical-electrical analogy.|$|E
500|$|This {{approach}} is especially {{useful in the}} design of mechanical filters—these use mechanical devices to implement an electrical function. [...] However, the technique can be used to solve purely mechanical problems, and can also be extended into other, unrelated, energy domains. [...] Nowadays, analysis by analogy is a standard design tool wherever more than one energy domain is involved. [...] It has the major advantage that the entire system can be represented in a unified, coherent way. [...] Electrical analogies are particularly used by transducer designers, by their nature they cross energy domains, and in control systems, whose sensors and actuators will typically be domain-crossing transducers. [...] A given system being represented by an electrical analogy may conceivably have no <b>electrical</b> <b>parts</b> at all. [...] For this reason domain-neutral terminology is preferred when developing network diagrams for control systems.|$|E

500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies {{are formed}} by {{comparing}} the mathematical description of the two systems. [...] Quantities that appear {{in the same place}} in equations of the same form are called analogues. [...] There are two main reasons for forming such analogies. [...] The first is to allow electrical phenomena to be explained in terms of the more familiar mechanical systems. [...] For instance, an electrical inductor-capacitor-resistor circuit has differential equations of the same form as a mechanical mass-spring-damper system. [...] In such cases the electrical domain is converted to the mechanical domain. [...] The second, and more important, reason is to allow a system containing both mechanical and <b>electrical</b> <b>parts</b> to be analysed as a unified whole. [...] This is of great benefit in the fields of mechatronics and robotics. [...] In such cases the mechanical domain is most often converted to the electrical domain because network analysis in the electrical domain is highly developed.|$|E

Burnley escaped the bombing, largely because it was near the limit of German bomber range and close to higher value targets in Manchester. Although the blackout was enforced, most of the aircraft in the sky above the town would have been friendly and on training missions, or returning to the factories for maintenance. Aircraft crashes did occur, however: In September 1942 a P-38 Lightning from the 14th Fighter Group USAAF crashed near Cliviger, and Black Hameldon Hill claimed a Halifax from No. 51 Squadron RAF in January 1943 and also a B-24 Liberator from the 491st Bombardment Group USAAF in February 1945.
