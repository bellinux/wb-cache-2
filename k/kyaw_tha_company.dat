40|$|This Master Thesis {{treats the}} non monetarian aspect about the Internet Portal from a {{consumer}} and company perspective. The {{purpose of this}} thesis i st o give or create a picture and a tool, a model for how the Internetportal could be evaluated an valued. By creating a so called Dynamic Scorecard {{the authors of this}} Thesis have created a model throug which the purpose of this thesis is served. Through this model the authors {{have come to the conclusion}} that the Internet Portal can be evaluated through both economic, social, service and technical factors as well as through what relationship the companies or consumers value concerning the Internet provider. The product of conclusions of this Thesis is that there are three main factors upon wich the Internet Portal is valued. These main factors consists of the situation, the purpose and the view that consumers and companies have of the Portal. This understanding together with the model that the authors have created give he Intenetportal provider a tool after wich he can evaluate his clients and visitors in the future. The thesis is also built upon a certain amount of emperical studies of bothe companies and consumers. Studies that have been made after the created model and wich also has functioned as a testing of the model. The empirical study shows <b>tha</b> <b>companies</b> and consumers do not have a common picture of how they view the Interntportal on all levels. It also shows that the shown interest in the Internetportal often depends on the size and the market power of the companies as clients as well as which situation the company is in. Same thing about the consumers. The advise to the Internetportal provider is that it is crucial to market the Portal with a clear cut approach and to focus on segmented client groups, treat them according to their interest and needs, and to focus on providing the clients with updated information about what type of customers is isiting the portal, how many is shopping, what do they want, almost act as a link between consumer and customers, which is key to attract new customers/clients to the Portal...|$|R

If the web site gets high ranking in search engines it will attract more web traffic. Semantic markup is a technique to structure a web site, so it can be understandable by humans and computers. This allows the crawler or spider to understand the content of the web site during the search engine process. Semantically structured web sites increase the web visibility in search engines. RDFa is a semantic markup and supported by the W 3 C. In this thesis we have focused on the RDFa as a semantic markup technique.

40|$|The Indian post-independence {{industrial}} policies, such as import substitution, industrial licensing, {{and limited}} private ownership, fostered a breed of inefficient and uncompetitive companies. Deregulation, foreign competition and financial reform led many financially unviable firms to consider exit or restructuring options. However, the existing legal, {{political and social}} system did not provide the appropriate framework for efficient and equitable resolution of insolvency cases, thus dramatically slowing {{the pace of the}} much needed industrial restructuring. This paper shows that there is no single comprehensive and integrated policy on corporate bankruptcy in India comparable with the bankruptcy code in the US. Instead, {{there are a number of}} legislative acts and special provisions, which provide procedural guidance on the liquidation or reorganisation process and there is an involvement of different agencies, having overlapping jurisdiction, which creates systemic delays and complexities in the process. In so far as the objective of a well functioning bankruptcy system is to promote economic efficiency by maximising the total value of assets, the Indian system fails, as under this system, liquidation or reorganisation is extremely time and resource costly; the system does not encourage optimal valuation outcomes; and creates incentives for managers or stockholders to take actions that generate private benefits at the expense of firm value. The paper evaluates the existing corporate bank-ruptcy system; and the incentives and biases it has created, given the Indian socio-political context and economic goals. It assesses the new Companies (Second Amendment) Act, 2002, and the possibility of its success in streamlin-ing and correcting the shortcomings of the existing process. The Protectionist Past After its independence from British rule in 1947, India adopted a socialistic and state dominated economic system and over the next four decades aggressively pursued a series of protectionist policies designed to develop and promote the domestic industrial base. Policies such as import substitution, industrial licensing, limited private owner-ship, and price fixing gave rise to a new breed of Indian <b>companies</b> <b>tha...</b>|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} recent developments in the corporate finance l iterature is the growing realization that insights from the classic US b ased finance theories are not always equally valid {{in other parts of the}} world. An extensive literature has been developed on the links between issues such as corporate governance, ownership structure or legal framew ork and all types of corporate finance decisions (leverage, dividend pol icy, firm growth, investment policy, etc., etc.). This dissertation adds different aspects to this quickly developing research area by analyzing effects related to two main issues: the presence of internal capital ma rkets within (mostly) private Belgian business groups and the 1997 Belgi an bankruptcy legislation reform. The emergence of internal capital markets is a direct consequence of the fact that different business entities are interlinked through common ow nership. Most of the theoretical and empirical research on this subject has concentrated on US conglomerates and South-East Asian business group types, such as the Japanese keiretsu or the Korean chaebol. More recently, business groups in emerging markets have been receiving more r esearch attention as well. Somewhat surprisingly, research on Continenta l European business groups is still limited. Especially the role of unqu oted groups has received little attention in the corporate finance liter ature, sometimes due to lack of data, other times driven by  in our opi nion  an underestimation of the phenomenons importance. Depending on t he strictness of the definition, between 30 and 50 % of all top 10, 000 co mpanies in Belgium are part of a group structure. The vast majority of t hese groups do not have an exchange quoted component. For all of these f irms, accounting data driven models  which are by definition the only t ype available for non-quoted companies  often do not yield the same qua lity of results as they would for comparable stand-alone companies, beca use individual group member financial statements do not reflect all rele vant information. In the first Part of this dissertation we demonstrate this in two different research settings: the debt source mix of group me mber companies (Chapter 1), and the effect of groups and internal capita l markets on bankruptcy prediction (Chapters 2 and 3). In Chapter 1, we show that internal capital markets within private busin ess groups are used to optimize the debt source mix of subsidiaries thro ughout the group. Novel to the debt source literature, we include bi-level variables, using financial statements of individual large opera ting subsidiaries and consolidated data of the group as a whole. We focu s on the determinants of the two most important sources of debt financin g for non-quoted group member companies, viz. bank debt and intra-gro up debt. As a benchmark, we also examine determinants of bank debt for c omparable stand-alone companies. We find that bank debt use of group mem ber companies is far lower as compared to that of stand-alones. All test s (univariate, tobit regressions and system of equations regressions) co nsistently point to a pecking order of intra-group debt over bank debt. We find that the use of intra-group debt increases with the depth of the internal capital markets (i. e. subsidiaries of larger, older, less leve red groups use more intra-group debt). As the possibility of providing i ntra-group debt diminishes (i. e. as the financial health of the group de creases), more bank debt is used at subsidiary level, especially by thos e member companies that are able to borrow at the lowest costs: larger f irms with many tangible assets to be given as collateral. Our findings a re consistent with the existence of a group-wide optimization process mi nimizing overall financing costs. As shown in the first Chapter, internal capital markets are actively use d in Belgian business groups. This implies that the legally independent companies that are part of the group are economically linked. This could be important for all finance applications that use company level accoun ting data. One of the best known applications is the assessment of corpo rate failure, which clearly is of interest to lending banks, clients, su ppliers, etc. The bankruptcy prediction literature largely ignores owner ship related elements and implicitly assumes all companies are independe nt entities. Using a sample of medium and large sized companies, we show in Chapter 2 that this assumption is not always justified. Most of the popular bankruptcy predictors, such as measures of liquidity, leverage o r profitability have more predictive power for stand-alone <b>companies</b> <b>tha</b> n for group member firms. After univariate tests and univariate regressi ons, we build optimized specifications of multivariate logistic regressi on models. Without adding any new variables, predictive accuracy can be increased by estimating separate models for stand-alone companies and gr oup subsidiaries. We also find that the addition of group-related variab les, including a dummy for group membership or the Altman (1993) Z-scor e of the business group significantly increases model performance. These group corrections are shown to improve the fit of some well-known natio nal and international prediction models. Chapter 3 applies the same approach as Chapter 1, viz. using bi-level data (at subsidiary level and ultimate owner level) to the ideas develo ped in Chapter 2. We extensively show how the presence of an internal ca pital market could influence bankruptcy prediction models performance. Using the logit models from Chapter 2 as a benchmark, we extend the anal ysis with key group level variables (size, age, leverage, profitability, etc.). This detailed owner level information greatly improves the model fit and predictive success rates. Vuong tests confirm that the relative content of information is significantly improved, even when compared to models that are already group corrected in the way described in the pre vious Chapter. We find that financially sound groups tend to support wea k subsidiaries, thus increasing the latters survival chances. If the fi nancial situation of the group itself is precarious, it continues to sup port core activity subsidiaries, but it may terminate non-core businesse s. Our results are consistent with, and also add to recent theoretical a nd empirical findings from the internal capital markets literature. While Chapters 2 and 3 focus on company and group specific factors which can explain or predict whether or not a company will file for bankruptc y, it is important to note that the bankruptcy process is not independen t of the legal framework in which a company operates. Key aspects of ban kruptcy legislation can determine company survival chances as well. Ther efore, the 1997 reform of the Belgian bankruptcy system is the subject o f the second Part of the dissertation. The main goal of the 1997 reform was to transform the liquidation-biased 19 th century bankruptcy rules into a system that encourages corporate r estructuring and preserves employment as much as possible. In Chapter 4, we use time-series methodology to assess if the reform has indeed lead to lower aggregate bankruptcy rates while correcting for variations in t he general state of the economy. Specifically, we estimate distributed l ag models that control for macroeconomic variables such as GDP growth, i nflation, business cycle indicators, etc. and find that aggregate bankru ptcy rates are significantly lower in the post-reform period. Novel to t he literature, we separately analyze the impact for different types of s mall and micro businesses, split up according to legal form and industry. This allows us to distinguish between the effects of different aspects of the reform (the most important of which are the introduction of anti -domino measures, the new reorganization code and the formation of chamb ers of commercial research). We find that the positive impact of the ref orm is somewhat more pronounced for stock corporations (mostly small bus inesses) than for partnerships (mostly micro firms), and that the reform has only lowered bankruptcy rates in manufacturing and trade industries. These findings support the notion that the anti-domino part of the ref orm may have been the most effective. The final Chapter analyzes in detail one of the key pieces of the reform, viz. the 1997 reorganization procedure. Recent theoretical studies indicate that the ex ante probability of success for the reform was low because dual chapter (i. e. both formal liquidation & formal reorganizati on procedures) bankruptcy systems should be most efficient in market-bas ed economies, while single chapter systems (i. e. formal liquidation only) are preferable in bank-based countries. Next to a descriptive analysis, we estimate logit models to distinguish between (a) companies that fil e for reorganization and companies filing for liquidation and, (b) betwe en companies that successfully draft a reorganization plan that is confi rmed by the court versus companies that do not. Using hazard models, we also look into the determinants of the length of time unsuccessful compa nies are protected by the reorganization procedure before liquidation. N ew to the empirical literature, we add variables on debt source mix, gro up membership (cf. Chapters 1  3) and redundancy pay. We confirm that, compared to foreign equivalents, the Belgian reorganization procedure ha s very low usage and success rates. Our evidence suggests that the prote ction granted by the reorganization procedure, is often used by the deci sion-making equity/bank coalition, not in an effort to effectively reorg anize as a going concern, but to bide time to find a suitable buyer for the companys assets. Overall, the reorganization procedure has certainl y not succeeded in achieving its policy goal of offering a realistic alt ernative for formal liquidation. nrpages: 181 status: publishe...|$|R
