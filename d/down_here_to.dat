25|$|We came <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> offer {{evidence}} in this case and the court has held under the law that the evidence we had is not admissible, so {{all we can do is}} to take an exception and carry it to a higher court to see whether the evidence is admissible or not...we cannot even explain to you that we think you should return a verdict of not guilty. We do not see how you could. We do not ask it.|$|E
500|$|In May, {{the detective}} William J. Burns {{traveled}} to Atlanta to offer further {{assistance in the}} case. However, his Burns Agency withdrew from the case later that month. C. W. Tobie, a detective from the Chicago affiliate who {{was assigned to the}} case, said that the agency [...] "came <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> investigate a murder case, not to engage in petty politic." [...] The agency quickly became disillusioned with the many societal implications of the case, most notably the notion that Frank was able to evade prosecution due to his being a rich Jew, buying off the police and paying for private detectives.|$|E
500|$|Ragan, who was {{the leader}} before the fifteenth caution, {{described}} his frustration after being black flagged by saying, [...] "It was tough to swallow. Who knows {{what would have happened}} in that next lap? We had a top-five car [...] and we didn't finish in the top five, so that's a bummer. We had a car that could've won the Daytona 500. We were sitting in position and just didn't do it. This thing only comes around once a year, so I'll think about it until we throw the checkered flag on next year's Daytona 500. So it's tough, but there is a bright side– we finished, we got some points and we ran up front, but we just didn't get what we come <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I came <b>down</b> <b>’ere</b> <b>to</b> {{look for}} {{somebody}} like you," [...] he ses, [...] "but I never dreamt I should have such luck as this. I’m an actor, and I’ve {{got to play}} {{the part of a}} sailor, and I’ve been worried some time ’ow {{to make up for the}} part. D’ye understand?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, nothing, nothing,' replied Wardle. 'About an old sexton, {{that the}} good people <b>down</b> <b>here</b> suppose <b>to</b> have been carried away by goblins.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gosh!" [...] Billy {{whispered to}} Saxon. [...] "He's lean enough, {{but look at}} his muscles. Everybody <b>down</b> <b>here</b> seems <b>to</b> go in for {{physical}} culture." ...|$|R
500|$|Alberta's women, {{especially}} those of the UFA-affiliated United Farm Women of Alberta, were active in the province's moral reform movement. [...] They were also active in seeking the vote: in 1913 a delegation of them arrived at the legislature demanding the vote; Sifton asked them [...] "did you ladies wash up your luncheon dishes before you came <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> ask me for the vote? [...] If you haven't you'd better go home because you're {{not going to get}} any votes from me." [...] In October 1914 another delegation arrived, bearing the signatures of 40,000 people. [...] At that time, the Premier agreed that most traditional objections to extension of the franchise were [...] "played out", but expressed concern at the increases that would result to the cost of elections and uncertainty at whether most of the province's women actually wanted suffrage. [...] In February 1915 a larger delegation arrived at the legislature and occupied the MLAs' seats, demanding that the franchise be extended quickly enough to allow women to vote in the upcoming prohibition referendum; an angry Sifton refused and suggested to the women that if they wanted the vote, they should contact their MLAs and promise that they would use their votes to re-elect them, [...] "which is after all one of the strongest way in which you can appeal to male human nature, as represented in the legislature." [...] Even so, he committed to raising the issue in the legislature after the referendum. [...] On September 17, 1915, he told UFA President James Speakman that he had given instructions for the preparation of a statute [...] "placing men and women in Alberta on the basis of absolute equality so far as Provincial matters are concerned." [...] True to his word, he introduced legislation in the spring of 1916 giving women the vote in all provincial and municipal elections. [...] The Conservatives supported it enthusiastically, and only St. Albert MLA Lucien Boudreau voted against it (though Ribstone Liberal James Gray Turgeon admitted that he was supporting his leader's legislation against his own convictions).|$|E
2500|$|Rapper Lupe Fiasco, one of {{the initial}} {{supporters}} of Occupy Wall Street, wrote a poem, [...] "Moneyman", for the protest. Susan Sarandon spoke at the demonstration saying, [...] "I came <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> educate myself.... There's a huge void {{between the rich and}} the poor in this country." [...] Actor and activist Mark Ruffalo has supported the Occupy Wall Street protest saying, [...] "Peaceful Resistance. That is what changes the world. We must be peaceful. This movement is about decency." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, I’ve {{seen this}} boy before," [...] he said, starting. [...] "Had {{a chat with}} him yesterday. That’s what brought me <b>down</b> <b>here</b> to-day, <b>to</b> see whether I couldn’t find him again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Biddy," [...] said I, [...] "I made {{a remark}} {{respecting}} my coming <b>down</b> <b>here</b> often, <b>to</b> see Joe, which you received with a marked silence. Have the goodness, Biddy, {{to tell me}} why." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you {{fetching}} {{all these}} people <b>down</b> from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> do the work the men there ought to do? How are the men there to get their wages?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{it seems}} good to me. Seems {{like old times}} to sit <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> your cooking with the kitchen door open and the {{chickens}} singing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hug the land, sir, in {{the hope}} of passing the enemy's ship without being seen, for I think she must be somewhere <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> leeward." ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{waved his}} hand towards the north, {{when he first saw}} me. [...] "Keep on that side!" [...] he shouted. [...] "And come on <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> me!" ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. BARLOW. You'd make a detective, Gerald--you're {{so good at}} putting two and two together. I listened till I'd {{heard as}} much as I wanted. I'm not sure I didn't come <b>down</b> <b>here</b> hoping <b>to</b> hear another {{conversation}} going on.|$|R
60|$|DOORKEEPER. It's all clear. You can {{get away}} <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> gentlemen. Keep <b>to</b> the left, then sharp to the right, round the corner.|$|R
6000|$|... 'On a {{far less}} {{pleasant}} errand, Sir,' replied Mr. Pickwick, the colour mounting to his face at the recollection. 'I have come <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> Sir, <b>to</b> expose the treachery and falsehood of an individual, upon whose truth and honour I placed implicit reliance.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have got}} through all that,--you and I have for ourselves;--but {{there is a}} sort of unseemliness in your coming <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> see a poor Quaker's daughter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The great Mr Pecksniff, {{the celebrated}} architect, gentlemen.' said the landlord, 'has come <b>down</b> <b>here,</b> <b>to</b> help {{to lay the}} first stone {{of a new and}} splendid public building.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She says {{he follows}} her about, and comes <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> lie {{in wait for}} her. It's a most strange {{business}} altogether. You went to see them, didn't you?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{believe there}} are: I {{know there are}} some at Swindon; and I do not see why {{they should not be}} found, here and there, all the way along the foot of the <b>downs,</b> from <b>here</b> <b>to</b> Cambridge.|$|R
6000|$|... "If it {{had been}} a great sum, it might have done you honour," [...] said she. [...] "But I will tell you what this is. James More lies {{shackled}} in prison; but this time past, they will be bringing him <b>down</b> <b>here</b> daily <b>to</b> the Advocate's..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll be jiggered! It {{looks to}} me like as if you'd come <b>down</b> <b>here</b> tryin' <b>to</b> be awful too good. I wish I had money enough to buy a glass case to put you in. I reckon I could sell the lot up to the museum." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, of course," [...] impatiently. [...] "My Aunt Jane. Silly! We {{just cut}} away <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> {{surprise}} you. Aunty's {{never seen the}} place, and here was a good chance." ...|$|E
60|$|NED. [Irritably. Getting {{chair for}} her, seating her, and seating himself again.] Look here, Alice, I know your game. You invited me <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> {{make a fool}} of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm nobody's boy," [...] said Fred, getting up, with {{a bitter}} choking in his throat; [...] "my mother's dead; I only sat <b>down</b> <b>here</b> <b>to</b> rest {{me for a}} while." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So it {{has seemed}} to me, Chippewa. The Injins must {{be there in a}} strong force, and we shall find it no easy matter to get through them. How do you propose to do it?" [...] "Go by in night. No udder way. When can't see, can't see. Dere plenty of rush dere; dat good t'ing, and, p'raps, dat help us. Rush good cover for canoe.

6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} indeed," [...] she went on, [...] "if {{anything}} I have done has caused all this trouble. Captain Granet came <b>down</b> <b>here</b> partly <b>to</b> play golf, partly at my invitation. He was here yesterday afternoon, {{as my father}} knows.

6000|$|... "More self-conceit and a better-fitting dress I never saw," [...] thought Margery; [...] "it's {{loose and}} easy, {{and yet it}} seems to fit perfectly, and I do believe she thinks she {{is some sort of}} an upper angel who has condescended <b>to</b> come <b>down</b> <b>here</b> just <b>to</b> see what common people are like." ...|$|R
