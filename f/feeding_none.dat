Os óbitos foram mais comuns em meninos, no primeiro trimestre de vida e durante o inverno. A comparação de cada caso de MSI com duas crianças-controle da mesma vizinhança, através de regressão logística condicional múltipla, identificou os seguintes fatores de risco: baixo nível socioeconômico (medido através da renda {{familiar}} e da escolaridade materna), baixo peso ao nascer, presença de outras crianças no domicílio, mães jovens e fumantes e aleitamento misto ou artificial.

40|$|A {{total of}} 84 sows (PIC, Line 1050) and their litters {{were used to}} {{determine}} the effects of lactation and creep feeding on sow and piglet performance. Three groups of sows were blocked according to day of farrowing and parity and allotted to four treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial with lactation feed intake (ad libitum vs. restricted) and creep <b>feeding</b> (<b>none</b> vs. creep) as factors. Piglets were cross-fostered within each block to standardize litter weights and litter size (> 11 pigs). A common lactation diet (1, 586 kcal ME/lb, 0. 97 % TID Lys) was used in the study. From d 3 of lactation, ad libitum sows were allowed free access to feed while restricted sows were fed 25 % less than those fed ad libitum. A pelleted creep diet (1, 585 ME/lb, 1. 56 % TID Lys) with 1. 0 % chromium oxide was offered to creep-fed pigs from d 3 to weaning (d 21). Piglets were weighed individually at d 3, 7, 14, and 21. Amount of creep feed consumed was determined daily. Fecal samples from all creep-fed pigs were taken on d 7, 14, and 21 and fecal color was assessed to categorize pigs as eaters or non-eaters. Sow weight and P 2 backfat thickness (6. 5 cm from the midline over the last rib) were measured after farrowing and at weaning. There was no interaction between lactation feed intake and creep feeding. Ad libitum feeding of sows reduced BW loss (- 33. 0 vs. - 52. 9 lb; P 0. 30) sow BW and backfat loss, but increased days to estrus (5. 4 vs. 4. 9 d; P< 0. 03) for sows that returned to heat by 14 d. Creep feeding tended to improve litter weaning weights (132. 7 vs. 124. 9 lb/d; P< 0. 09) by reducing mortality rate after cross-fostering (3. 9 vs. 7. 3 %; P< 0. 06). Total creep feed intake of litters did not differ (2. 24 vs. 2. 28 lb/litter; P< 0. 93) between ad libitum and limit-fed sows. About 60 % of the creep-fed pigs were categorized as eaters. Of those identified as eaters, 23, 20, and 57 % began consuming creep feeding from d 3 to 7, 7 to 14, and 14 to 21, respectively. From d 0 to 28 post-weaning, there was no effect of creep feeding on d 28 weights (P< 0. 93), ADG (P< 0. 86), ADFI (P< 0. 93), and F/G (P< 0. 95) compared to non-creep fed pigs. Eaters tended to be heavier until d 28 post-weaning (P< 0. 16) and had greater (P< 0. 06) ADG and total gains than non-eaters and no creep pigs. In conclusion, creep feeding improved survivability, but had no effects on pre-weaning gain and sow performance. Low feed intake during lactation negatively affected both sow and litter performance. Creating more eaters in whole litters may be beneficial in improving post-weaning performance...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Feeding {{problems}} {{in young children}} have a negative influence on medical and psychosocial development. In this study we evaluate and compare the outcome of two different multidisciplinairy treatments of feeding problems. The multidisciplinairy team of the “Isala Klinieken” treats feeding problems with a psychotherapeutical and logopedical intervention. At the UMCG the treatment {{is based on a}} nutritinal intervention and tube feeding can be part of this treatment. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate and compare the outcome of those two interventions. We also aim to prove a difference in tube feeding policy between both teams. We furthermore asses the satisfaction of parents with the treatment. Material and method: In this multicenter cohort study we collected data of children with a feeding problem, without an organic cause, who started treatment after January 2009 at the Isala Klinieken or UMCG and finished treatment before March 2012. The primary outcome was the diagnosis of a feeding problem according to the Wilson criteria after treatment was finished. Improvement of standard deviations of weight to lenght at the start and end of treatment and follow-up was compared. The current feeding behaviour was rated by parents of children on the Behavioral Pediatrics Feeding Assessment Scale (BPFAS) and satisfaction of treatment on the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire 8 (CSQ- 8). A questionnaire with data and growth curves of 30 anonymous patients were submitted to both teams to asses a difference in tube feeding policy. Results: 53 patients were included. (Isala Klinieken, n= 30; UMCG n= 23) Follow-up data of (median) 26 months after the start of the treatment was collected for 33 patients. (Isala Klinieken n= 18; UMCG n= 15) At the UMCG 9 children were treated with tube <b>feeding,</b> <b>none</b> were treated with tube feeding at the “isala klinieken”. (p=< 0, 001) The submitted questionair showed aswell that the UMCG started tube feeding more often (p= 0, 028) During follow-up more than one third of the children was still diagnosed with a feeding disorder. This outcome was the same for both interventions. Weight to lenght at the beginning and the end of the treatment did not improve for the children treated in the Isala klinieken (p= 0, 390), but did for the UMCG (p= 0, 006) Scores on the BPFAS (p= 0, 769) and CSQ- 8 (p= 0, 879) were the same for both interventions. Conclusion: Feeding {{problems in}} young children are difficult to treat. After an intensive treatment more than one third of the children are still diagnosed with an feeding problem. Both intervention have the same outcome. An nutritional intervention, of which tube feeding can be part of, archieved an improvement of nutritional status of children. An psychotherapeutical and logepedical intervention did not improve the nutritional status. Both interventions had an similair outcome on feeding behavior and coping of parents with this behavior and satisfaction of treatment. ...|$|E

30|$|Desert fires {{can cause}} a {{decrease}} in the number of plant species as time since fire increases (Alford et al. 2005), but the response varies among plant species and is complicated by other factors like seed bank size, rainfall (Abella et al. 2009), competition, disturbance history, and nutrient availability (Rew and Johnson 2010). For example, fire can temporarily reduce the seed bank of less nutritious grasses like the exotic species red brome, but the exotic Mediterranean split grasses can quickly increase above pre-fire levels (Brooks 2002). The latter plant species, when eaten by tortoises, do not contain enough digestible nitrogen to compensate for nitrogen lost through excretion (Meienberger et al. 1993). If there was {{a decrease in the}} number of plant species with increasing time since fire, as suggested by Alford et al. (2005), and a decrease in native annual forbs as shown by others (Brooks 1999, Brooks and Esque 2002), tortoises might be expected to forage more widely (Oftedal et al. 2002) in search of preferred food plants (Henen 2002) over time. Again, this is not reflected in our data. Sanz-Aguilar et al. (2011) compared minimum convex polygons for the Mediterranean tortoise Testudo graeca, a species that lives in a fire-prone ecosystem, in burned and unburned areas and found no difference. They concluded that individuals living in burned areas did not have to increase their territories to <b>feed.</b> <b>None</b> of their tortoises moved from burned to unburned areas despite the small size of their study site (70 ha).|$|R

40|$|A {{controlled}} {{trial was}} performed to compare enteral feeding with either an amino acid based feed or a whole protein feed as sole treatment for active Crohn's disease. Twenty four patients were studied (nine with ileal, 11 with ileocolonic, and four with colonic disease). Both feeds proved effective; nine of 13 patients randomised to receive the amino acid based feed were in clinical remission within three weeks as defined by a simple activity index compared with eight of 11 treated with the whole protein feed. Patients in clinical remission were then crossed over onto the other <b>feed.</b> <b>None</b> of the six patients who were changed to the whole protein feed relapsed over the subsequent three week period compared with three of seven patients who were changed to the amino acid based feed. In responders the median serum C reactive protein concentration fell from 21 mg/l (range 9 - 82) on entry to 6 mg/l (range 3 - 19) at six weeks. Seven patients relapsed within eight months of starting solid food (mean 3. 7 months), while nine were still in remission (follow up period 3 - 9 months, median six months). Detailed studies of staged reintroduction of food and permitted food additives were carried out over a four year period in a patient with extensive stricturing small bowel Crohn's disease who had been brought into remission by open treatment with enteral feeding. Carrageenan, other permitted emulsifiers, bread, meat, potatoes, oranges, refined sugar, dairy produce, flour, and rice were all reintroduced without any objective ill effect, but green vegetables provoked a clinical and biochemical relapse within one week of introduction.

In this trial, 18 -wk-old laying hens in the early phase of production (ISA Brown) were randomly assigned to 2 groups and fed durum wheat middlings-based diets containing soybean or micronized-dehulled fava bean meal as the main protein source. Eggs were collected and weighed daily. Laying performance, egg quality, and feed conversion ratio were evaluated for 10 wk. The only significant effect detected was for feed intake (P < 0. 05), which was lower in hens fed the diet containing fava bean than for hens fed soybean meal, without however any negative effects on <b>feed</b> efficiency. <b>None</b> of the egg quality parameters studied were influ-enced by dietary treatment, except for yolk color score that was reduced in hens fed the fava bean diet (P < 0. 05).

Small colonies of massive Porites spp. from the back reef of Moorea, French Polynesia, were incubated for 1 month under combinations of temperature (29. 3 °C vs. 25. 6 °C), pCO 2 (41. 6 vs. 81. 5 Pa), and <b>feeding</b> regimes (<b>none</b> vs. ad libitum access to live Artemia spp.), with the response assessed using calcification and biomass. Area-normalized calcification was unaffected by pCO 2, temperature, and the interaction between the two, although it increased 40 % with feeding. Biomass increased 35 % with feeding and tended to be higher at 25. 6 °C compared to 29. 3 °C, and as a result, biomass-normalized calcification statistically was unaffected by feeding, but was depressed 12 - 17 % by high pCO 2, with the effect accentuated at 25. 6 °C. These results show that massive Porites spp. has the capacity to resist the effects on calcification of 1 month exposure to 81. 5 Pa pCO 2 through heterotrophy and changes in biomass. Area-normalized calcification is sustained at high pCO 2 by a greater biomass with a reduced biomass-normalized rate of calcification.

We determined that feeding behavior of food chain consumers was affected {{not only by the}} plant concentration of Se, but also by the mobility of the insects and choice of feed available. In study II, we examined the survival and development of beet armyworm (Spodoptera exigua) fed Se-enriched plant tissues from different lines of saltbush (Atriplex spp.) After feeding on lines of saltbush that produced high biomass and accumulated high concentrations of Se, insect growth and survival was reduced. In studies III, IV, and V, lambs, dairy cows, and rabbits were fed Se-enriched Brassica and Medicago (alfalfa) plants as part of their <b>feed</b> ration. <b>None</b> of the tested animals exhibited any Se toxicity symptoms, but they had increased levels of Se in most tissues sampled (e. g., organs, blood, urine, feces), excluding milk. In study VI, we evaluated biotransfer of Se from broccoli to rats to determine efficacy of Se for reducing colon cancer. We found that Se-enriched plant material was more effective than inorganic sources of Se for preventing precancerous colon lesions. Results from all studies clearly show that Se absorbed by plants can be transferred biologically in an intentional or unintentional manner to insects and animals...|$|R
40|$|The {{study of}} colony {{stimulating}} factor 1 (CSF- 1), a homodimeric serum growth factor that regulates mononuclear phagocytes and {{is involved in}} maternal-fetal interactions during pregnancy, was dramatically enhanced by the observation that the recessive mutation osteopetrosis, op, is an inactivating mutation in the CSF- 1 -encoding gene. Homozygous mutant (op/op) mice completely lack CSF- 1, are osteopetrotic consequent to a deficiency in osteoclasts, have severely reduced numbers of macrophages, and have reduced fertility evident at the pre- and postimplantation stages of pregnancy. We show here that op/op females have a lactational defect, and consequently, although some are able to produce offspring, few nurture any pups and <b>none</b> <b>feeds</b> a full litter. This lactational defect is due to incomplete mammary gland ductal growth during pregnancy, a precocious development of the lobulo-alveolar system, and despite expression of milk proteins, a failure {{to switch to a}} lactational state. These data show that CSF- 1 has a {{role in the development of}} the mammary gland during pregnancy...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{techniques}} were tested for their efficiency in extracting adenosine 5 ′-triphosphate (ATP) from strained rumen fluid (SRF). Extraction with 0. 6 N H 2 SO 4, using {{a modification of}} the procedure described by Lee et al. (1971), was the most efficient and was better suited for extracting particulate samples. Neutralized extracts could not be stored frozen before assaying for ATP because large losses were incurred. The inclusion of internal standards was necessary to correct for incomplete recovery of ATP. The ATP concentration in rumen contents from a cow receiving a ration of dried roughage (mainly alfalfa hay) ranged from 31 to 56 μg of ATP per g of contents. Approximately 75 % of the ATP {{was associated with the}} particulate material. The ATP was primarily of microbial origin, since only traces of ATP were present in the <b>feed</b> and <b>none</b> was found in “cell-free” rumen fluid. Fractionation of the bacterial and protozoal populations in SRF resulted in the isolation of an enriched protozoal fraction with a 10 -fold higher ATP concentration than that of the separated rumen bacteria. The ATP pool sizes of nine functionally important rumen bacteria during the exponential phase of growth ranged from 1. 1 to 17. 6 μg of ATP per mg of dry weight. This information indicates that using ATP as a measure of microbial biomass in rumen contents must be done with caution because of possible variations in the efficiency of extraction of ATP from rumen contents and differences in the concentration of ATP in rumen microbes...|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the citrus}} fruits grown {{worldwide}} are oranges of various varieties. More {{than half of}} these are processed and have their juice extracted. The resultant wet citrus waste {{has been used for}} over 60 years as a source of feed for livestock. Most citrus pulp is now dried for convenience of storage and transport prior to feeding to ruminant livestock. Brazil and the U. S. A. are the largest exporters of dried citrus pulp in the world. Significant quantities are produced and utilized in Australia. Citrus pulp is primarily a low protein feed with a carbohydrate profile very different to the usual raw materials used by stockfeed manufacturers. It is a high energy feed, but contains virtually no starch and has more in common with dried spring forage, sugarbeet pulp or root crops than with cereal grains. As such 'it has advantages over cereal grains, particularly in formulated diets for ruminant animals. As a by-product feed citrus Pulp from different sources may vary considerably in chemical composition, palatability and nutritive value. This variation is a characteristic of virtually all by-Product feeds. The level of utilization of citrus pulp in formulated feeds is very much dependent on availability and relative cost effectiveness of alternative raw materials. Dried citrus pulp from the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area (MIA) is in strong demand for live sheep export pellets and general sheep, beef and dairy cow supplements with a limited quantity being included at low levels in sow <b>feeds.</b> Virtually <b>none</b> is used in rations for poultry, growing pigs or horses in Australia...|$|R
40|$|Background: Whether {{long-chain}} polyunsaturated {{fatty acids}} (LCPs) {{play a role}} in the development of the young nervous system in term infants is debated. Objective: We investigated whether supplementation of formula with LCPs for 2 mo improves the quality of general movements (GMs) in healthy term infants at 3 mo of age. Design: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled study was conducted with 2 groups of healthy term infants: a control-formula (CF) group (n = 131) and an LCP-supplemented-formula (LF) group (n = 119). A breastfed (BF) group (n = 147) served as a reference. Information on potential confounders was collected at enrollment. Videotapes were made of the infants' spontaneous motor behavior at 3 mo of age to assess the quality of their GMs. On the basis of quality, normal GMs were classified as normal-optimal or normal-suboptimal, and abnormal GMs were classified as mildly or definitely abnormal. Attrition at 3 mo of age was 15 % and nonselective. Multivariate regression analyses with adjustment for confounders were carried out to evaluate the effect of the type of <b>feeding.</b> Results: <b>None</b> of the infants had definitely abnormal GMs. Infants in the CF group had mildly abnormal GMs significantly more often than did infants in the LF and BF groups (31 % compared with 19 % and 20 %, respectively). Infants in the BF group had normal-optimal GMs more frequently than did infants in the LF and CF groups (34 % compared with 18 % and 21 %, respectively). Logistic regression analyses confirmed these findings. Conclusion: Supplementation of healthy term infants with LCPs during the first 2 mo of life reduces the occurrence of mildly abnormal GMs...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Magnum and isthmus morphologic {{characteristics}} (surface epithelium height, fold {{height and}} diameter, and periodic acid-Schiff-positive area and surface epithelium cells) of stained 6 -/tm tissue sections were meas-ured by light microscopy, with data acquisition using a digitizing tablet interfaced to a microscope {{and to a}} personal computer with morphometric-dimensional software. Tissues were obtained from Leghorn layers in two separate experiments in which production of eggs with low and high Haugh unit (HU) values was induced by either genetic selection or by feeding V. Eggs produced by these hens had HU differences between {{the high and low}} groups of 11 to 14 units (both experiments, P =. 0001) and had a greater volume of thick albumen fraction in high-HU groups (both experiments, P =. 0001). The computer software-integrated digitizing system enabled rapid measurements of multiple characteristics. In the genetic lines, higher magnum fold height and magnum and isthmus surface epithelium height were detected at moderate significance (all at P <. 05) in the tissues of the layers producing high-HU eggs than in tissues from the low-HU line. Other morphologic variables were not different between genetic lines. In response to <b>feeding</b> V, <b>none</b> of the morpho-logical characteristics were affected, although magnum fold height approached difference at P <. 07. Based on the observations in these two experiments, magnum fold height may be a further important factor related to egg albumen condition, in addition to surface epithelium height. It appears, however, that layers producing eggs of considerably different HU values, due in these experiments to genetics or V feeding, can have magnum or isthmus morpholog-ical characteristics that are indistinguishable, or only moderately different, as detected by integrated digitizing technology. (Key words: layer, Haugh units, oviduct morphology, magnum morphology, digitized tissue measurement...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundProgress to full oral feeding from a tube or {{parenteral}} feeding is {{a complex}} process for very preterm infants born before 32 weeks of gestation. The influence of infant characteristics and medical complications on feeding progression has not been studied thoroughly. The {{aim of this study}} was to constitute a regression model to estimate the postmenstrual age (PMA) of full oral feeding and the length of transition time from the initiation to completion of oral feeding. MethodsA chart review was conducted on very preterm infants born between 2005 and 2010 in one medical center in Taiwan. All enrolled infants were able to take all nutrition by mouth before discharge. ResultsA total of 117 infants fulfilling the criteria were included. The mean PMAs for the initiation and completion of oral feeding were 33. 9  ±  1. 7 and 35. 1  ±  2. 0 weeks, respectively. Infants required 7. 5  ±  6. 6 days from initiation to full oral feeding. The results of a stepwise regression revealed that the reciprocal of birth weight (beta coefficient =  3. 81, p <  0. 001), moderate–severe bronchopulmonary dysplasia (beta coefficient =  1. 21, p <  0. 001), necrotizing enterocolitis (beta coefficient =  0. 84, p <  0. 005), and patent ductus arteriosus (beta coefficient =  0. 69, p <  0. 01) were predictors for the PMA of full oral feeding. The regression model incorporating those factors explained 62. 5 % of the variation in the feeding outcome (p <  0. 001). Gender, multiple gestations, mild bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, and sepsis had no effect on the <b>feeding</b> outcome. <b>None</b> of the explored factors were significantly correlated with transition time. ConclusionA regression model incorporating significant predictors to estimate the PMA of full oral feeding in very preterm infants was suggested. It could enhance communication between health professionals and parents about the feeding progress of infants born very prematurely...|$|R
40|$|Genetically {{modified}} crops {{which had}} been commercial applied extensively majorly are the insect resistance and herbicide tolerance events. In this study, the Bt insecticidal gene Cry 1 Ab, the glyphosate-tolerant gene EPSPS, and the selection marker gene PMI were combined into a single transferred DNA fragment and introduced into sugarcane by Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Thirty-three resistant plantlets were obtained after selection using a PMI/mannose selection system. Thirty of these resistant plantlets were PCR positive for the three target genes. Southern blot assay revealed that the copy number of the integrated fragment in the transformed plantlets varied from 1 to 7. ELISA analysis showed that 23 of the 33 resistant plantlets expressed Cry 1 Ab and EPSPS protein. Five single-copy and ELISA-positive transgenic lines were tested under laboratory and field conditions to determine their resistance to insects and herbicides, and also evaluated their agronomic characteristics and industrial traits. Results showed that larvae fed with fodder mixture containing stem tissues from single-copy transgenic lines were weak and small, moreover, pupation and eclosion were delayed significantly during voluntary <b>feeding</b> bioassays. <b>None</b> of transgenic sugarcane was destroyed by cane borer while more than 30 % of wild type sugarcane was destroyed by cane borer. For herbicide resistance, the transgenic plantlets grew healthy even when treated with up to 0. 5 % roundup while wild type plantlets would die off when treated with 0. 1 % roundup. Thus demonstrate that these transgenic lines showed strong insect resistance and glyphosate tolerance under both laboratory and field conditions. But in the field most of the transgenic plants were shorter and more slender than non-transformed control plants. So they presented poor agronomic characteristics and industrial traits than non-transformed control plants. Thus, {{a considerable number of}} embryogenic calli should be infected to obtain transgenic lines with potential for commercial use...|$|R
40|$|Current malaria {{vector control}} {{programmes}} rely on insecticides with rapid contact toxicity. However, spatial repellents {{can also be}} applied to reduce man-vector contact, which might ultimately impact malaria transmission. The {{aim of this study}} was to quantify effects of airborne pyrethroids from coils and DDT used an indoor residual spray (IRS) on entomological parameters that influence malaria transmission. The effect of Transfluthrin and Metofluthrin coils compared to DDT on house entry, exit and indoor feeding behaviour of Anopheles gambiae sensu lato were measured in experimental huts in the field and in the semi-field. Outcomes were deterrence - reduction in house entry of mosquitoes; irritancy or excito-repellency - induced premature exit of mosquitoes; blood feeding inhibition and effect on mosquito fecundity. Transfluthrin coils, Metofluthrin coils and DDT reduced human vector contact through deterrence by 38 %, 30 % and 8 %, respectively and induced half of the mosquitoes to leave huts before feeding (56 %, 55 % and 48 %, respectively). Almost all mosquitoes inside huts with Metofluthrin and Transfluthrin coils and more than three quarters of mosquitoes in the DDT hut did not <b>feed,</b> almost <b>none</b> laid eggs and 67 %, 72 % and 70 % of all mosquitoes collected from Transfluthrin, Metofluthrin and DDT huts, respectively had died after 24 hours. This study highlights that airborne pyrethroids and DDT affect a range of anopheline mosquito behaviours that are important parameters in malaria transmission, namely deterrence, irritancy/excito-repellency and blood-feeding inhibition. These effects are in addition to significant toxicity and reduced mosquito fecundity that affect mosquito densities and, therefore, provide community protection against diseases for both users and non-users. Airborne insecticides and freshly applied DDT had similar effects on deterrence, irritancy and feeding inhibition. Therefore, it is suggested that airborne pyrethroids, if delivered in suitable formats, may complement existing mainstream vector control tools...|$|R
