5|$|The {{economy of}} Gyeongju is more diverse than the city's {{image as a}} tourist haven would suggest. Although tourism <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> economy, most {{residents}} work in other fields. Over 27,000 are employed in manufacturing compared to roughly 13,500 in the hospitality industry.|$|E
5|$|The list of highest {{points in}} each state <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sport of highpointing, where enthusiasts attempt to visit the highest point {{in each of the}} {{contiguous}} forty-eight states or in all fifty states. As of 2006, 155 people had reached all fifty state highpoints. Roughly 200–300 people attend the Highpointers Club convention each year.|$|E

5|$|The {{seafood and}} poultry {{industries}} thrived {{through much of}} the 20th century, but neither <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> island's economy today. Chincoteague is a major tourist destination on Virginia's Eastern Shore, with many coming to enjoy the beaches on Assateague Island. The success of Marguerite Henry's 1947 children's book Misty of Chincoteague and its sequels helped publicize Chincoteague, as did the 1961 film, Misty.|$|E
5|$|Most of the cancer-causing {{mutations}} {{cause the}} protein to be truncated at the carboxy-terminus. The C-terminal end of folliculin has {{shown to be}} the domain through which it interacts with FNIP1, and thereby possibly the mTOR pathway. FLCN is highly conserved in vertebrates—it is very similar between many vertebrate species. The 508th amino acid, normally lysine, is affected by a missense mutation in some people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. The lysine at this position {{is found to be}} conserved between invertebrate and vertebrate orthologs of folliculin, indicating that it <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> protein's function.|$|E
5|$|Msambweni {{grew from}} a small village into a bustling little town. Fishing <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> local {{community}} of Msambweni and is {{the primary source of}} income. The area is mainly Muslim and inhabited by Digo peoples. The Kwake District Development Plan 2002–2008 attempted to improve fish landing sites and beach access for fisherman on the coast of Msambweni. Coconut palm is grown, as are cashew nuts, fruits and buxa coloring. Maize, cassava, cowpeas and rice are grown for domestic consumption. There are numerous stalls along the main road in the town selling fruit and vegetables. Silica sand is mined at Msambweni and transported to Nairobi to make bottle glass. Beekeeping and seaweed farming are also local occupation and its commercialization in the area has been supported by ACT! Kenya with financial assistance from the European Union.|$|E

5|$|Music <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> locals of Cortina, with {{a guitar}} {{found in most}} houses, and young musicians are often found walking the streets. Every year, {{from the end of}} July to early August, Cortina hosts the Dino Ciani Festival and Academy. It is held in honour of the celebrated Italian pianist Dino Ciani (1941–1974) who died when he was only 32. The festival attracts young pianists from around the world who are able to benefit from classes with some of the world's leading performers. The Festival of the Bands is another annual musical event {{featuring}} brass bands from Italy and beyond during the last week of August. Cortina's own band, parading in traditional costumes, is a central attraction dating back to 1861. Cortina d'Ampezzo hosted the 1953 Miss Italia contest, won by Marcella Mariani. Traditionally, on the eves of the festivals of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity and St Philip and St James, the youth of the town would climb the hills at sunset and light fires.|$|E
5|$|Though a small {{shrine in}} the temple complex, the Vimala temple <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Goddess-oriented Shakta and Tantric worshippers, who revere it {{even more than the}} main Jagannath shrine. Vimala is {{considered}} to be the Tantric consort of Jagannath and a guardian of the temple complex. Devotees pay respect to Vimala before worshipping Jagannath in the main temple. Food offered to Jagannath does not get sanctified as Mahaprasad until it is also offered to Vimala. The Goddess-oriented festival of Durga Puja in the Hindu month of Ashvin (October) is celebrated for sixteen days at Vimala, culminating with Vijayadashami.|$|E
5|$|Tourist attractions in Omaha include history, sports, {{outdoors}} and cultural experiences. Its principal tourist attractions are the Henry Doorly Zoo and the College World Series. The Old Market in Downtown Omaha is another major attraction and <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city's retail economy. The {{city has been}} a tourist destination for many years. Famous early visitors included British author Rudyard Kipling and General George Crook. In 1883 Omaha hosted the first official performance of the Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show for eight thousand attendees. In 1898 the city hosted more than 1,000,000 visitors from across the United States at the Trans-Mississippi and International Exposition, a world's fair that lasted {{for more than half}} the year.|$|E

5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge first, and then will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible {{to prevent them from}} spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E
