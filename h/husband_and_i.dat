My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> got involved and were really moved and horrified. As I was writing the song I was putting myself in that place – {{what would it be like}} to be trapped? Threatened? Alone? Unable to tell anyone what was happening because you're afraid of what would happen?" ...|$|E
500|$|In early 1942, {{the company}} that Doc Goddard worked for {{required}} him to relocate to West Virginia. California laws prevented the Goddards from taking Monroe out of state, and she faced the possibility of having {{to return to the}} orphanage. As a solution, she married their neighbors' son, 21-year-old factory worker James [...] "Jim" [...] Dougherty, on June 19, 1942, just after her 16th birthday. Monroe subsequently {{dropped out of high school}} and became a housewife; she later stated that the [...] "marriage didn't make me sad, but it didn't make me happy, either. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hardly spoke to each other. This wasn't because we were angry. We had nothing to say. I was dying of boredom." [...] In 1943, Dougherty enlisted in the Merchant Marine. He was initially stationed on Catalina Island, where she lived with him until he was shipped out to the Pacific in April 1944; he would remain there for most of the next two years. After Dougherty's deployment, Monroe moved in with his parents and began a job at the Radioplane Munitions Factory in Van Nuys, both as part of the war effort and to earn her own income.|$|E

If they have, {{they ought to be}} considered as provided for, and then they shouldn't have <b>husbands.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> rather think {{it would be better if}} men didn't have anything either, so that they might be forced to earn their bread.

500|$|People's {{reactions}} varied: some {{described themselves}} as [...] "shocked"; others admitted to being [...] "shaky" [...] or nervous {{for the rest of}} the day. Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in the house. I said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E

2500|$|Among the miners, {{a number}} {{attributed}} religious significance to events. Mario Sepúlveda said, [...] "I was with God, {{and with the}} Devil – and God took me." [...] Mónica Araya, {{the wife of the}} first man rescued, Florencio Ávalos, noted: [...] "We are really religious, both my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I,</b> so God was always present.

In writing to Secretary Forrestal upon being informed of the naming of the ship, Carpenter’s widow wrote on August 9, 1945 of her “deep appreciation of the honor bestowed on my two sons and me in the naming of this ship for my late <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> hope her record {{will be one of}} which to be proud…” ...|$|E

2500|$|McMahon ran as an outsider, {{criticizing the}} Senate for its {{connection}} to Wall Street and federal banking bailouts. Her campaign ads emphasized her distance from politics, stressing she was [...] "not a career politician". She criticized the current Senate for passing large bills in a perfunctory manner, particularly the $800 billion stimulus package. Her first televised political ad, [...] "Perseverance", touted her {{experience as a}} business leader, stating, [...] "Thirty years ago, my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> started our business.

[...] "I don't know why you Americans dislike us ... Is it because the world is under a spell called liberalism? Your own public, here in America, is not as anti-Communistic as ours is in Vietnam. Americans talk about my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> leaving our native land permanently. Why should we do this? Where would we go? To say that 70 percent of my country's population is Buddhistic is absolutely true. My father, who was our ambassador to the United States until two months ago, has been against me since my childhood." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{boost to}} McCain's {{campaign}} came on March 25, when former First Lady Nancy Reagan endorsed the Senator {{at her home}} in Bel Air, Los Angeles, California.

My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> first came to know him as a returning Vietnam War POW, and were impressed by the courage he had shown through his terrible ordeal. I believe John's record and experience have prepared him well to be our next president." [...] Standing with Reagan, McCain said, [...] "This is an important, most important kind of expression of confidence in my ability to lead the party that I could have." [...] McCain's friendship with Nancy Reagan had survived a period of coldness following his divorce from his first wife Carol, whom the Reagans were quite fond of.|$|E

2500|$|Oates founded The Ontario Review, a {{literary}} magazine, in 1974, with Raymond J. Smith, {{her husband and}} fellow graduate student, who would eventually become a professor of 18th-century literature. Smith would serve as editor of this venture, and Oates served as associate editor. The magazine's mission, according to Smith, the editor, was to bridge the literary and artistic culture of the U.S. and Canada: [...] "We tried to do this by publishing writers and artists from both countries, as well as essays and reviews of an intercultural nature." [...] In 1980, Oates and Smith founded Ontario Review Books, an independent publishing house. In 2004, Oates described the partnership as [...] "a marriage of like minds—both my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> are so interested in literature and we read the same books; he'll be reading a book and then I'll read it—we trade {{and we talk about}} our reading at meal times…".|$|E

Wagner bought the item from Rik Gijsen, a Netherlands-based antiquities dealer. The piece was acquired by the museum in April 2006. Approximately 1,000 of the nutcrackers from the museum are highlighted in a book by Wagner, The Art and Character of Nutcrackers. The museum is open to visitors in the afternoon, from May to October; it is open to the public on weekends during the period from November to April. Arlene and George Wagner traveled the globe in search of nutcrackers for the museum: [...] "That's all we do! My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have never been on a cruise. We just got back from Europe yesterday, hunting for nutcrackers. We went to the Netherlands. We attended a couple of very big European antique shows. We also had nutcrackers waiting for us to pick up – very valuable 16th and 17th century ones." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2009, Garner {{became an}} artist {{ambassador}} for Save the Children, promoting national literacy, nutrition and early education efforts. Since 2014, Garner {{has served on}} the board of trustees for Save the Children, the United States branch of the British children's charity, advocating for early education. She had been an ambassador for six years, and frequently visits with families involved in the organization's Early Steps to School Success program, which coaches families to help children learn in the early years. In 2011 she partnered with Frigidaire as part of her work with Save The Children. In 2013, Garner took her eldest daughter Violet to a Save The Children gala in New York: [...] "My <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> have never taken our kids to a public event before, but I brought my daughter Violet, because ... I want her to see the passionate commitment Mark Shriver and Hillary Clinton have {{to make the world a}} better place for everyone."

We are fully committed to Canada. I would not have accepted this position otherwise... have never belonged to a political party or the separatist movement," [...] and {{went on to say that}} in the documented footage she had been speaking about Haiti, and not Quebec. Martin added on his earlier comments: [...] "There is no doubt in my mind that her devotion to Canada is longstanding and resolute," [...] though some critics continued to argue that Jean's response had been too vague. By late August, polls showed that there had been a 20% drop in support for the recommendation of Jean as the next governor general, in response to which the Haitian community voiced their support for Jean, even holding special church services in her honour. Jean reaffirmed in late 2010 that the rumours of her separatist sympathies were untrue and revealed that she had been upset by those journalists who she saw as capitalizing on sensationalism, rather than seeking accuracy through investigation, but she had been advised repeatedly not to respond.|$|E
2500|$|Tinderbox {{would be}} later hailed by Jean-Benoît Dunckel of Air. He {{selected}} Tinderbox for his [...] "5 albums forever" [...] list, saying, [...] "They played so well together; I saw them in concert and I never forgot that moment". Billy Howerdel of A Perfect Circle rated {{it as his}} all-time favourite album [...] Howerdel described it as [...] "one of the spookiest records I've ever heard. Some of the songs on there have such a dense atmosphere. Sometimes when I'm stuck, I'll listen to that. It's like sometimes when you have no inspiration and {{you go out and}} look at the moon, that's kind of what that record is for me". Jenny Lee Lindberg [...] of Warpaint cited the band among her influences, as well as the song [...] "Umbrella", initially included in the track listing of the 1986 CD version. She said: [...] "This is a song that my <b>husband</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> bonded over – we’d definitely heard it individually before, but one day we were just playing the album and that song stopped us in our tracks… played it on repeat for the whole night.
