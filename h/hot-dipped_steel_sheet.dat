This paper is aimed at investigating the wear of the die cavity of a clinching tool. A clinching tool with a specially shaped cavity was used for joining thin <b>hot-dip</b> galvanized <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Various types of physical vapour deposition (PVD) coatings such as ZrN, CrN and TiCN were deposited on the shaped surface of the die using Lateral Rotating Arc-Cathodes technology. <b>Hot-dip</b> galvanized <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were used for testing the clinching tool. The material properties of PVD coatings that were deposited on the shaped part of the clinching die were evaluated. Finite Element Analysis was used to localize {{the area of the}} shaped part of the die and the part of surface area of the cylindrical die cavity of ϕ 5. 0 mm, in which high contact pressure values were predicted.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of {{employing}} pre-coated <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> is to minimize corrosion of steel. However, coatings can be severely affected by forming processes. In the forming processes, due to the different modes of deformation, the strain levels are different and so can affect {{the properties of the}} coatings to a varying degree. Special attention has to be paid to the influence of deformation conditions on the performance of the coating, as regards protection against corrosion. The adhesion of the coating must remain good, and the surface should not be damaged during forming. Therefore, it is necessary to study the behavior of its corrosion resistance against the deformation. In this work, effect of strain path on the corrosion behavior of <b>hot-dip</b> galvanized <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> has been studied. Corrosion behavior of <b>hot-dip</b> galvanized <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> at various strain levels has been evaluated under four different strain paths namely, biaxial, plane strain, uniaxial (drawing) and tensile modes. The sheets were deformed by a limiting dome height test (LDH) set-up. A correlation between the degree of deformation and the loss in extent of corrosion protection offered by the coating has been established by carrying out electrochemical studies such as potentiodynamic polarization and impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in 3. 5 % NaCl solution. The present study shows that increase in deformation increases the extent of delamination of the coating for all the modes of deformation. The severity of deformation on delamination, however, has been found to vary in the order of, tensile < uniaxial < plane < biaxial. © Elsevie...|$|R

The ram velocity for all the tests was set at 0.2 mm/s to allow slow deformation of the concrete and the steel strips. The pull-out test samples include a foam concrete cube (100 mm × 100 mm × 100 mm) with galvanized <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> (50 mm × 150 mm) {{standing in the middle of}} the concrete cube.

Coating reactivity change due to the deformation was investigated by means of quasi-steady DC electrochemical tests. The results allow to infer that, in great spangle samples, the main deformation mechanism is twinning whereas in small spangle ones, pyramidal slip systems happen as well. The increase of the reactivity with the deformation is greater in tension than in rolling and it is more important in small than in great spangle samples. Facultad de Ingenierí...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} a new method for online {{analysis}} of the zinc coating of galvanized <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) is presented.

To achieve an ablation depth in the range of the coating thickness of about 10 µm a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double pulse mode was used. The depth information is obtained by control of the ablation depth by adjusting the burst energy using an external electro-optical attenuator. Concepts for the determination of the coating thickness and the chemical composition are presented.

40|$|The use of <b>hot-dip</b> {{galvanized}} <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> as {{base material}} for laser brazing {{led to the}} formation of spatter and a wavy appearance of the seam. High-speed imaging revealed that spatter formation occurs mainly close to the seam edges. Thermography of the brazing process showed that the type of zinc coating affects the resulting temperature distribution and thereby changes the conditions for the zinc evaporation. Higher temperatures were observed at the seam edges on electro galvanized and phosphated substrates. The cross sections and the process analysis indicate that the zinc evaporation on electro galvanized substrates takes place prior to the wetting with the molten filler material. On the other hand a merely partial evaporation of the zinc coating and the accumulation of zinc at the seam edges takes place during the brazing of hot-dip galvanized substrates. The formation of spatter is caused by the zinc dissolution and the subsequent evaporation of the zinc rich alloy at the seam edges. The optical properties of the base material are considered to be a crucial factor for the temperature distribution and the resulting zinc evaporation. Brazing trials on hot-dip galvanized and phosphated substrates, which show a reflectance similar to electro galvanized and phosphated specimens, confirm this assumption, as no spatter formation at the seam edge was observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{color of}} <b>hot-dip</b> {{galvanized}} <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> was adjusted in a reproducible way using a liquid Zn-Ti metallic bath, air atmosphere, and controlling the bath temperature {{as the only}} experimental parameter. Coloring was found only for sample s cooled in air and dipped into Ti-containing liquid Zn. For samples dipped into a 0. 15 wt pct Ti-containing Zn bath, the color remained metallic (gray) below a 792 K (519 C) bath temperature; it was yellow at 814 K, violet at 847 K, and blue at 873 K. With the increasing bath temperature, {{the thickness of the}} adhered Zn-Ti layer gradually decreased from 52 to 32 micrometers, while the thickness of the outer TiO 2 layer gradually increased from 24 to 69 nm. Due to small Al contamination of the Zn bath, a thin (around 2 nm) alumina-rich layer is found between the outer TiO 2 layer and the inner macroscopic Zn layer. It is proven that the color change was governed by the formation of thin outer TiO 2 layer; different colors appear depending on the thickness of this layer, mostly due to the destructive interference of visible light on this transparent nano-layer.

Project work was performed in three application areas (I) additional coating of galvanished steel sheet; (II) new environmental friendly functional coatings; (III) coatings with very high corrosion protection. Within its partial project TKS was involved in performing the coating trials; basical investigations with regard on the concentration profiles, corrosion behaviour in unpainted and painted state, paint adhesion as well as spot welding and adhesive bonding behaviour of the coating systems were performed. Furtheron, the requirements on the coatings were formulated and the obtained results were evaluated in particular with regard on an industrial application in the future. Application area I: The coating system which evolves through PVD-coating of <b>hot-dip</b> galvanised <b>steel</b> <b>sheet</b> with Mg followed by a thermal diffusion treatment seems to be a promising approach for the development of new metallic alloy coatings for <b>steel</b> <b>sheet.</b> However, open questions remain in particular with regard on the basic mechanisms of the alloy formation, the principal microstructure of the coatings and the resulting corrosion behaviour. Application area II: It can be concluded that the requirements on the coatings were principally met by means of evaporation of Si without inlet of oxygene. However many questions remain open in particular with regard on the influence of the parameters of the plasma pre-cleaning in vacuum and of the PVD-deposition on the structure of the coatings and hence on their application-related properties. Further studies are therefore necessary for further optimising and eventual industrial application of both coating systems. Regarding application area III only very few investigations were performed {{within the framework of the}} TKS work; on the base of only these results no final conclusions regarding the properties of the investigated coatings were possible.

40|$|International audienceBefore <b>hot-dip</b> galvanizing, the <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> are {{annealed}} in {{an atmosphere}} of N 2 and H 2, containing only traces of water (about - 30 °C dew point). The main purposes of this heat treatment are to recrystallize the steel substrate after cold rolling and to reduce the iron oxides in order to improve the wettability by liquid zinc. At the same time, the less-noble alloying elements (Mn, Si, P, Cr, Al, B) of the steel preferentially oxidize and segregate to the surface. The steel surface is then partly or wholly covered by oxide particles, sometimes resulting in problems of wettability by liquid zinc. The present study focuses on the characterization of the oxide particles formed on the surface of a low alloyed ferritic steel.

40|$|In {{this study}} a new {{approach}} to the online monitoring of the Al depth profile of <b>hot-dip</b> galvanised <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> is presented, based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). The coating composition is measured by irradiating the traversing <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> with a series of single laser bursts, each at a different <b>sheet</b> <b>steel</b> position. An ablation depth in the same range as the coating thickness (about 10 µm) is achieved by applying a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double-pulse and triple-pulse mode. The ablation depth is controlled by adjusting the burst energy with an external electro-optical attenuator. A fingerprint of the depth profile is gained by measuring the LIBS signals from zinc, aluminium and iron {{as a function of the}} burst energy, and by post-processing the data obtained. Up to three depths can be sampled simultaneously with a single laser burst by measuring the LIBS signals after each pulse within the laser burst. A concept for continuously monitoring the Al depth profile during the galvanising process is presented and applied to different hot-dip galvanised coatings.

40|$|<b>Hot-dip</b> {{galvanizing}} of <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> pipes, {{and other}} fabrication items {{is a popular}} method of corrosion protection. Currently, steel articles are immersed in molten zinc at 860 {degrees}F, thereby forming a {open_quotes}frozen{close_quotes} metal (interfacial zinc iron intermetallic layer) on the surface. Drawbacks to the current technology include the expense of heating parts at such a high temperature and the generation of by-products such as zinc alloys, zinc oxides, and smoke. Furthermore, new federal regulations have significantly reduced acceptable lead levels in coatings, because lead from galvanized, coated steel will dissolve in water.

40|$|Microdefects on thin {{conversion}} {{film coated}} Zn <b>hot-dip</b> galvanized <b>steel</b> (HDG) <b>sheets</b> were generated by stretch-forming and verified by cyclic voltammetry, which revealed higher anodic and cathodic current density levels on the pre-damaged samples. The data {{were compared to}} the kinetics of electrochemically determined ion transport processes along strained conversion film covered substrate surfaces in humid air and along uniaxially stretched epoxy/conversion layer/zinc interfaces exposed to the same corrosive environment. Analysis with a Scanning Kelvin Probe indicated increased driving forces for ion transport, but verified accelerated kinetics of cathodic delamination only {{in some areas of}} the stretch-formed epoxy coated substrates. This finding reflected a rather insignificant macroscopic acceleration of corrosion processes for samples that were strained by up to 15 %. Similarly, accelerated oxygen reduction driven electrolyte spreading on bare conversion film covered HDG surfaces was verifiable only on a pm scale during initial process stages. This confirmed that stretching-induced defect formation increased the electrochemical activity of the substrates, but neither effectively nor significantly promoted the kinetics of ion transport along the sample surfaces in the present case. As a result, stable epoxy/conversion layer/zinc interfaces were maintained. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper tackles {{the effects}} of contact {{pressure}} and of an industrial surface chemical treatment, which is called New Inorganic Treatment (NIT), on the frictional behaviour and the roughness changes of <b>hot-dip</b> galvanized mild <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> Samples of different topographies are investigated by plane friction test with increasing contact pressure and 3 D profilometry. For non-chemically treated (non-NIT) surfaces, friction coefficient is an increasing function of pressure. Moreover, above a certain pressure, which seems to depend on topography, a stick-slip phenomenon occurs. For chemically treated (NIT) surfaces, no stick-slip phenomenon is observed. Friction coefficient is lower than for non-NIT surfaces and, above a certain pressure, decreases as pressure increases. The behaviours of the 4 morphological textures investigated, either electron beam textured (EBT) or electron discharge textured (EDT), are qualitatively identical. The roughness is a decreasing function of pressure except during stick-slip phase, during which roughness evolves erratically at values higher than what the imposed pressure should lead to. The observation of height distribution curves reveals the very different surface deformations between non-NIT and NIT surfaces, whatever the topography. We conclude that, by reducing local friction shear stress, an indirect effect of the chemical treatment is the modification of the deformation mode of zinc asperities, which in fine would {{reduce the amount of}} wear debris...|$|R

Fatigue behavior of the <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> in the high-cycle fatigue region can be represented by Basquin’s equation with coefficient and exponent value of 921. 2 and 0. 093, respectively. An endurance limit of 255 MPa is observed. In addition, fatigue strengths of the dual-phase <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> display lower magnitude than their bulk counterparts. Effect of mean stress on fatigue behavior of the <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> is well predicted by Walker’s model. Exponential calibration factor is introduced to the models by SWT, Goodman and Morrow with comparable prediction to the Walker’s mode...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. An {{effective}} {{way to reduce the}} weight of vehicle body seems to be application of new materials, and such trend is remarkable. Among the various materials for vehicle body, stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> and cold rolled <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> are under the interests. However, in order to guarantee reliability of new material and to establish the long life fatigue design criteria for body structure, it is necessary to assess spot weldability and fatigue strength of spot welded lap joints fabricated under optimized spot welding condition. In this paper, spot weldability of stainless <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> STS 304 L and STS 316 L, and cold rolled <b>steel</b> <b>sheets,</b> SPCC and SPCD. Fatigue strength of lap joints spot welded between similar and dissimilar materials were also assessed...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on characterization of CO 2 {{laser beam welding}} (LBW) of dual phase (DP) and transformation induced plasticity (TRIP) <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> based on experimental, numerical simulation and statistical modeling approaches. The experimental work aimed to investigate the welding induced-microstructures, hardness, tensile properties and formability limit of laser welding butt joints of DP/DP, TRIP/TRIP and DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> under different welding speeds. The effects of shielding gas types and flow rates on the weldability of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> were also studied. The simulation of laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> through welding induced-temperature field, thermal cycles, residual stresses and distortions using Sysweld 2010 software v 12. 0 was the second goal of this research. Also stretch formability (Erichsen test) was simulated in this step using Abaqus/CAE software v 6. 9 - 1. The aim of statistical modeling was to predict and optimize laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> in industry through applying a three-factor-three-level Box-Behnken statistical design with full replication as a design of experiment (DoE) approach to design the experiments, develop mathematical models and optimize the welding operation. This was achieved by controlling selected welding parameters: laser power, welding speed and focus position. The experimental {{results showed that the}} CO 2 LBW is a successfully welding process for butt joining of DP and TRIP <b>steels</b> <b>sheets.</b> The LBW of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets</b> is successfully numerically simulated using the finite element (FE) code SYSWELD when using a 3 D Gaussian distribution heat source model with a conical shape. There are good agreements between the experimental- and FE- results during simulation of stretch formability of DP/TRIP steel weldments when using von Mises yielding model as yielding criterion. Statistically, mathematical models were developed to predict the required responses (mechanical properties, weld bead geometry and unit welding operation cost) of laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets.</b> It was found that the welding speed is the most significant parameter during laser welding of DP/TRIP <b>steel</b> <b>sheets...</b>|$|R
