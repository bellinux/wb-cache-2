25|$|An {{example of}} the use of {{cryoconservation}} to prevent the extinction of a livestock breed is the case of the Hungarian <b>Grey</b> <b>cattle,</b> or Magya Szurke. Hungarian <b>Grey</b> <b>cattle</b> were once a dominant breed in southeastern Europe with a population of 4.9million head in 1884. They were mainly used for draft power and meat. However, the population had decreased to 280,000 head by the end of World War II and eventually reached the low population of 187 females and 6 males from 1965 to 1970. The breed's decreased use was due primarily to the mechanization of agriculture and the adoption of major breeds, which yield higher milk production. The Hungarian government launched a project to preserve the breed, as it possesses valuable traits, such as stamina, calving ease, disease resistance, and easy adaptation to a variety of climates. The government program included various conservation strategies, including the cryopreservation of semen and embryos. The Hungarian government's conservation effort brought the population up to 10,310 in 2012, which shows significant improvement using cryoconservation.|$|E

40|$|Current cattle breeds are {{commonly}} classified as belonging {{either to the}} Bos taurus taurus or Bos taurus indicus sub-species or, alternatively, {{as well as to}} hybrids among them. In particular, several evidences have been produced so far, highlighting the presence of zebuine biochemical and genetic markers in breeds belonging to the Podolic group. Here we present novel evidences concerning the presence of zebuine markers in taurine cattle breeds from Southeastern Europe. In particular, the paper presents two sub-sections: the first, describing the results of a polymorphism analysis carried out at the GHR gene, in a population sample of 254 animals belonging to the Italian Podolic, Ukranian Grey, Hungarian Grey, Polish Red, Polish White Back, Lithuanian White Backed and Lithuanian Light Grey breeds; the second illustrating the presence of common hemoglobin protein markers, notably the alfa-globin Y and beta-globin AZebu variants, in samples belonging to Italian Podolic and <b>Grey</b> Alpine <b>cattle</b> breeds. Taken together, these results confirm the hybrid nature of European cattle breeds belonging to the Podolic group and, for the first time, suggest a possible zebuine influence (likely mediated by cattle of the Podolic group) in the <b>Grey</b> Alpine <b>cattle</b> breed...|$|R

40|$|Title of the paper: Estimating {{effective}} {{population size}} (Ne) from allele frequency changes in Bavarian Simmental (FV) and Tyrolean <b>Grey</b> (GV) <b>cattle</b> Frequencies of 10 to 16 alleles of blood group, hemo- and lactoprotein loci were estimated for FV in 1960, 1986 and 200, for GV in 1969, 1979 and 1998. Rates of inbreeding {{in the intervening}} periods and Ne`s were derived from Wahlund variances. The Ne`s for the two part periods of FV, spanning 2. 2 resp. 4. 1 generations, were 152 resp. 147, for the whole period of 6. 25 generation intervals 373. This {{is due to the}} opposing signs of the changes in the two part periods and it may reflect the large influence of a top sire on the gene pool in the first period and ensueing change to a FV gene reservoir similar to that in 1960. For GV the Ne`of the two part periods were 139 and 56, for the whole 97, roughly in agreement with the one expected from the two short periods. The lower Ne of the second part period agrees well with an estimate by the inbreeding increment in roughly the same time period...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the sources of variation of milk fatty acids (FA) routinely predicted by mid-infrared spectroscopy in Holstein-Friesian (HF), Brown Swiss (BS), Simmental (SI) and Alpine <b>Grey</b> (AG) <b>cattle</b> breeds. A linear mixed model was used to analyse the data which included 153, 801 individual milk samples from 14, 301 cows. Fixed effects included in the model were breed, month of sampling, year of sampling, stage of lactation, parity and first order interactions between them, and random effects were herd nested within breed, cow nested within breed and the residual error. Milk of AG cows exhibited the lowest content of saturated FA and the greatest content of unsaturated FA, whereas milk of BS had an opposite pattern. Holstein-Friesian and SI were intermediate between AG and BS breeds for all the FA except for total C 18 : 1, which was the greatest in HF. Saturated FA, C 14 : 0 and C 16 : 0 increased from calving until 120 days in milk, whereas unsaturated FA and C 18 : 1 decreased. First parity cows produced milk with lower concentration of de novo FA than multiparous animals. The greatest content of unsaturated FA and C 18 : 1 was observed in summer, whereas saturated FA, C 14 : 0, C 16 : 0 and C 18 : 0 decreased in summer and increased in winter. The differences in milk FA profile among breeds are useful for genetic selection and for feeding strategies...|$|R

40|$|The Italian Podolian is an {{autochthonous}} breed {{belonging to}} the <b>grey</b> steppe <b>cattle</b> group. In the past, the Podolian was present throughout all of the Adriatic and {{the southern part of}} Italy, but now it is restricted to four regions and displays morphological differences according to the region. It is thought that the Podolian contributed heavily to the genetic make-up of the Chianina and Romagnola breeds, while contrasting opinions exist regarding the relationship between the Podolian and the Piemontese. This paper aimed at characterizing genetic variability and structure by means of microsatellite loci to assess the relationship between the Podolian and the most relevant European breeds, and to detect evidence of selection in the considered breeds by investigating the existence of outlier loci. The DNA of 134 Italian Podolian individuals from 14 different herds in 4 breeding areas were collected, genotyped at 30 microsatellite loci and compared to 13 Italian and European breeds, including the grey type ones and using N’dama as the outgroup. The Podolian showed the highest values of observed heterozygosity and polymorphism content. Moreover in a subset of 50 samples (chosen according to geographic origin), polymorphism data analysis evidenced the absence of a geographically determined genetic structure. The hierarchical population clustering evidenced a Podolian cluster at K= 5 and phylogenetic tree based on Reynold’s distances confirmed the genetic links between the Podolian breeds. Two loci presented significantly low FST values, suggesting that they could be under the effect of balanced selection. It can be concluded that Italian Podolian has no genetic subdivision, contains a notable amount of genetic variability and is closely related to the other Podolian type breeds...|$|R
40|$|Ellis-van Creveld (EvC) {{syndrome}} {{is a human}} autosomal recessive disorder caused by a mutation in either the EVC or EVC 2 gene, and presents with short limbs, polydactyly, and ectodermal and heart defects. The {{aim of this study}} was to understand the pathologic basis by which deletions in the EVC 2 gene lead to chondrodysplastic dwarfism and to describe the morphologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular hallmarks of EvC syndrome in <b>cattle.</b> Five <b>Grey</b> Alpine calves, with a known mutation in the EVC 2 gene, were autopsied. Immunohistochemistry was performed on bone using antibodies to collagen II, collagen X, sonic hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor 2, and Ki 67. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to analyze EVC 1 and EVC 2 gene expression. Autopsy revealed long bones that were severely reduced in length, as well as genital and heart defects. Collagen II was detected in control calves in the resting, proliferative, and hypertrophic zones and in the primary and secondary spongiosa, with a loss of labeling in the resting zone of 2 dwarfs. Collagen X was expressed in hypertrophic zone in the controls but was absent in the EvC cases. In affected calves and controls, sonic hedgehog labeled hypertrophic chondrocytes and primary and secondary spongiosa similarly. FGF 2 was expressed in chondrocytes of all growth plate zones in the control calves but was lost in most EvC cases. The Ki 67 index was lower in cases compared with controls. EVC and EVC 2 transcripts were detected. Our data suggest that EvC syndrome of <b>Grey</b> Alpine <b>cattle</b> is a disorder of chondrocyte differentiation, with accelerated differentiation and premature hypertrophy of chondrocytes, and could be a spontaneous model for the equivalent human disease...|$|R
40|$|Antioxidants are {{molecules}} {{essential for}} the maintenance of cell homeostasis and their intake through the diet has positive effects on human health. Among antioxidants, low-molecular-weight (LMW) thiols represent an important class of compounds. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify LMW thiols in bovine milk. A total of 96 individual milk samples from Brown Swiss, Holstein-Friesian, Alpine <b>Grey,</b> and Simmental <b>cattle</b> breeds were collected in 8 herds. The LMW thiols were extracted from the soluble fraction of milk and, following a derivatization protocol, they were separated by reverse phase HPLC and detected fluorimetrically. Six thiol species were detected and 2, glutathione (GSH) and cysteine-glycine (Cys-Gly), were identified and quantified. Regardless of the breed, the average concentration of Cys-Gly in milk was greater than that of GSH. Overall, milk from dual-purpose breeds (Simmental and Alpine Grey) was richer in LMW thiols than milk from dairy cows (Holstein-Friesian and Brown Swiss). Glutathione and Cys-Gly, closely linked metabolically, were strongly correlated. Pearson correlations of Cys-Gly with protein and casein contents were moderately low, and no relationship was found between GSH and milk chemical composition. Future research should focus on the identification of all detected LMW thiol species...|$|R
