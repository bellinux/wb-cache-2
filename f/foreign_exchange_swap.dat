As a complementary analysis the volatility of the local <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interest rate term structure and the volatility of the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> spot were studied. The results concerning the <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>swaps</b> were in accordance with those expected by the theory, and show that they do change the local <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> interest rate term structure.
