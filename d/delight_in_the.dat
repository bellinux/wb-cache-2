5|$|Elves {{have few}} children, {{as a rule}} (Fëanor and Nerdanel were an exception, conceiving seven sons), and there are {{relatively}} sizeable intervals between each child (but see below for notes on Elvish birth rates in Middle-earth versus in Aman). They are soon preoccupied with other pleasures; their libido wanes and they focus their interests elsewhere, like the arts. Nonetheless, they take great <b>delight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> union of love, and they cherish the days of bearing and raising children as the happiest days of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Shedding one's clothes, Kutzer observes, is {{a symbol}} of {{shedding}} the social self and its constraints to then embrace the freedom of the animal self, but Lucie, who sets off for an adventure after shedding her pinafore and handkerchiefs, fails to embrace her animal self and learns nothing new about herself. True, she learns something about the animal world – hens shed their stockings and robins their red vests – but Lucie began her adventure as a well-behaved, proper young Victorian child and remains so at tale's end, taking <b>delight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> goffered pinafore and the laundered handkerchiefs that confine and define such a child. Having not learned something new about herself, Lucie's success as a literary heroine is moot.|$|E

25|$|Bradstreet's {{first two}} quaternions were her most {{successful}} rhetorical contrasts.

25|$|While the {{dominant}} note of Judaism is optimism, {{faith in a}} God who <b>delights</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> happiness of His creatures and expects their grateful appreciation of His bounties—see Abstinence in Judaism—there have, nevertheless, been prevalent in Jewish life certain ascetic tendencies of which the historian must take account.|$|R

25|$|Like Plato, Mazzoni {{was very}} {{concerned}} with determining the purpose of poetry (Weinberg, 324). For him, its purpose is to “move the reader to pleasure and <b>delight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> perception of the believable images.” Essentially, for Mazzoni, the purpose of poetry is recreation and pleasure; however, he also attaches a concept he calls “civil faculty.” In part, {{this has to do}} with the idea that taking a break from serious business (i.e., by creating or consuming poetry) allows one to return to that business afterwards with renewed enthusiasm. Mazzoni also says, however, that there is a distinct pleasure in poetry which, in addition to its ability to delight, carries with it a concealed lesson, moral, or other element that allows it to contribute to the improvement of society.|$|E
25|$|Pitrājñāpālanam (Sanskrit: पित्राज्ञापालनम्). Jamadagni {{requests}} Paraśurāma {{to marry}} and enter {{the second stage of}} life, the Gārhasthya Āśrama ("householder's life"). Paraśurāma respectfully turns the request down, saying he wishes to be forever away from the bondage of family. One morning, Reṇukā goes to a lake to fetch water. There she sees the Gandharva king Citraratha, taking <b>delight</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> water of the lake with his wife. Reṇukā is attracted to Citraratha and returns home excited, fantasizing about him. Jamadagni senses this and orders his three elder sons to kill their mother who he says has become impure by her adulterous thoughts. When the brothers refuse to carry out his command, Jamadagni asks Paraśurāma to do the same. Paraśurāma is caught between the command of his father, and the indebtedness to mother – he remembers the Smṛti scriptures which says the mother is ten times the greater than the father. After a lot of thought and counter-thought, he decides to obey his father. Paraśurāma beheads his mother and three brothers. Jamadagni is pleased and offers Paraśurāma two wishes. Paraśurāma asks for the resurrection of all four as the first wish, and their loss of memory about their killing as the second one. Jamadagni grants both the wishes and Reṇukā and her three sons get up as if from sleep. Paraśurāma thus satisfies his father and also brings back his mother to life.|$|E
