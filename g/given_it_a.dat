5|$|Early in the 20th century, {{paleontologist}} R. S. Lull {{proposed that}} the frills of ceratopsian dinosaurs acted as anchor points for their jaw muscles. He later noted that for Styracosaurus, the spikes would have <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> formidable appearance. In 1996, Dodson supported the idea of muscle attachments in part and created detailed diagrams of possible muscle attachments in the frills of Styracosaurus and Chasmosaurus, but did not subscribe {{to the idea that}} they completely filled in the fenestrae. C.A. Forster, however, found no evidence of large muscle attachments on the frill bones.|$|E
5|$|Harmless to humans, the hardnose shark {{is caught}} with {{gillnets}} and line gear by artisanal and commercial fisheries {{across much of}} its range. It is used for meat, which is sold fresh or dried and salted, though its small size limits its economic importance. Its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to overfishing, and given existing levels of exploitation, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Near Threatened. Off northern Australia, the hardnose shark makes up 13.6% of the gillnet catch and 4.0% of the longline catch. Since these losses {{do not appear to}} have diminished its population there, the IUCN has <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> regional assessment of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Mayfair {{is home to}} {{numerous}} galleries, which has <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> reputation as an international art hub. The Royal Academy of Arts is based in Burlington House. It was founded in 1768 by George III and is the oldest fine arts society in the world. Its founding President was Sir Joshua Reynolds. The academy holds classes as well as exhibitions, and students have included John Constable and J. M. W. Turner. It moved from Somerset House to Trafalgar Square in 1837, sharing with the National Gallery, before moving to Burlington House in 1868. The academy hosts a well-known annual Summer Exhibition, showing over 1,000 contemporary works of art that can be submitted by anyone.|$|E

5|$|Mobile's French and Spanish colonial {{history has}} <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> culture {{distinguished}} by French, Spanish, Creole, African and Catholic heritage, {{in addition to}} later British and American influences. It is distinguished from all other cities {{in the state of}} Alabama. The annual Carnival celebration is perhaps the best example of its differences. Mobile is the birthplace of the celebration of Mardi Gras in the United States and has the oldest celebration, dating to the early 18th century during the French colonial period.|$|E

The city's Gross Regional Product makes up about 8.5 percent of the republic's Gross domestic product.|$|E
25|$|Planetary {{scientist}} Erik Asphaug {{has suggested}} that Quaoar may have collided with a much larger body, stripping the lower-density mantle from Quaoar, and leaving behind the denser core. He envisions that Quaoar was originally covered by a mantle of ice that made it 300 to 500 kilometers bigger than it is today, and that it collided with another Kuiper-belt body about twice its size—an object roughly the diameter of Pluto (or even approaching the size of Mars), possibly Pluto itself. This model was made assuming Quaoar actually had a density of 4.2g/cm3, but more-recent estimates have <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> more Pluto-like density of only 2g/cm3, with no more need for the collision theory.|$|E

500|$|Mauna Kea ( [...] or , [...] ), is a {{dormant volcano}} {{on the island}} of Hawaii. Standing [...] above sea level, its peak is the highest point in the state of Hawaii. Most of the {{mountain}} is underwater; when measured from its oceanic base, Mauna Kea is over [...] tall and is the tallest mountain on Earth. Mauna Kea is about a million years old, and has thus passed the most active shield stage of life hundreds of thousands of years ago. In its current post-shield state, its lava is more viscous, resulting in a steeper profile. Late volcanism has also <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> much rougher appearance than its neighboring volcanoes; contributing factors include the construction of cinder cones, the decentralization of its rift zones, the glaciation on its peak, and the weathering effects of the prevailing trade winds. Mauna Kea last erupted 6,000 to 4,000 years ago and is now considered dormant.|$|E
500|$|In {{a review}} of the book What Mad Universe (1949), Paul Di Filippo of Sci Fi Weekly posited that the book's author Fredric Brown may have been {{influenced}} by Hubbard's story. Umberto Rossi wrote in The Twisted Worlds of Philip K. Dick (2011) that writer Philip K. Dick was likely influenced by Typewriter in the Sky. Rossi noted Typewriter in the Sky came out in a paperback format in 1951, and a year later Dick succeeded in getting his first short story, the tale [...] "Beyond Lies the Wub" [...] published. Rossi said Typewriter in the Sky was [...] "the text that admittedly inspired" [...] The Cosmic Puppets (1957) by Philip K. Dick. In the book Harlan Ellison's Watching (1989), by Harlan Ellison, Typewriter in the Sky is compared to Purple Rose of Cairo, [...] "I bet if L. Ron Hubbard had written Purple Rose of Cairo they'd have <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> Hugo ... I mean, it is sort of a hip, updated version of Typewriter in the Sky." [...] Gary Westfahl quoted Hubbard's work in a book of noteworthy science fiction quotations, Science Fiction Quotations: From the Inner Mind to the Outer Limits (2005).|$|E
500|$|Hypacrosaurus is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from other hollow-crested duckbills (lambeosaurines) by its tall neural spines and {{the form of}} its crest. The neural spines, which project {{from the top of}} the vertebrae, are 5 to 7 times the height of the body of their respective vertebrae in the back, which would have <b>given</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> tall back in profile. The skull's hollow crest is like that of Corythosaurus, but is more pointed along its top, not as tall, wider side to side, and has a small bony point at the rear. Unlike other lambeosaurines, the passages for the airways do not form an S-curve in the crest (at least not in H. altispinus). The animal is estimated to have been around [...] long, and to have weighed up to 4.0tonnes (4.4tons). As with most duckbills, its skeleton is otherwise not particularly remarkable, although some pelvic details are distinctive. Like other duckbills, it was a bipedal/quadrupedal herbivore. The two known species, H. altispinus and H. stebingeri, are not differentiated in the typical method, of unique characteristics, as H. stebingeri was described as transitional between the earlier Lambeosaurus and later Hypacrosaurus. Photographs of an adult H. stebingeri skull show an animal that looks very similar to H. altispinus.|$|E
