40|$|BACKGROUND. The {{main source}} of state public health {{institutions}} financing in Ukraine is budgetary funding. In order to overcome the underfunding, the idea of multichannel health financing was proposed in the late 1990 s. The main forms of extrabudgetary financial support of public health institutions in Ukraine are voluntary health insurance, non-profit self-financing, charity and sponsorship. The study aims to deeper {{understand the nature of}} alternative financing mechanisms of state public health institutions in Ukraine and peculiarities of their use in practice. METHODS. The proposed study is exploratory. Case-study was selected as research method. Nine unstructured interviews were conducted in six health care facilities that have {{agreed to participate in the}} study. All studied facilities were in-patient. RESULTS. The sources of financial revenues of the studied institutions were as follows: reimbursement for treatment of insured patients, reimbursement for treatment of sickness funds members, payments for services (medical examinations, counseling, transportation to the hospital), rental of premises, payment for internship from the students of paid forms of medical education, charitable contributions, contracts with companies, contracts with private clinics based in public institutions’ premises (limited liability companies, private entrepreneurs), sponsorship, grants, gifts, payments for services for foreigners, and in-kind revenues. Major health facilities expenditures were the following: salaries (not covered from extrabudgetary revenues; ranged from 70 % to 92 % of the funds provided to the institutions from state (municipal, regional) budget), energy carriers (partially covered from <b>extrabudgetary</b> <b>funds),</b> patients nutrition, medicines, materials, household expenditures, reparation of premises, and purchase of equipment (mostly covered from extrabudgetary revenues). In the studied cases, funds raised by alternative funding mechanisms amounted from 2 % to 22 % of the total annual institutions budgets, depending on the type of facilities and administrative subordination. CONCLUSIONS. Alternative financing mechanisms (extrabudgetary revenues) help to support functioning of public healthcare institutions. In the studied cases, extrabudgetary revenues amounted on average 10 % of the annual institutions budget. Considering that 70 - 92 % of the funds provided to the institutions from state (municipal, regional) budget were spent on salaries, <b>extrabudgetary</b> <b>funds</b> significantly help public health institutions to work...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the urban {{process in the}} face of China's {{transition}} to a market economy is examined from the perspective of political economy. Before economic reform, China operated a centrally planned economy. Production activities were organized on the basis of sectoral departments of the central government, and the reproduction of labour was carried out through self-contained development. The dominance of the state stemmed from its role in resource allocation. Economic reform, launched 'in 1978, introduced market mechanisms to urban processes in China. Through fiscal, housing, and land reforms decisionmaking was decentralized. Under so-called 'comprehensive development', municipalities are now required to organize urban development. The state has lost its dominant status in budgetary investment. Self-raised, <b>extrabudgetary</b> <b>funds</b> increased rapidly. Work units still extract surplus value efficiently but have had to become the major purchasers in housing markets because workers in the public sector cannot afford housing. The persistence of state ownership in the mode of production makes it unlikely that market forces will play a leading role in urban development in China. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues relating}} to the establishment and financial management of <b>extrabudgetary</b> <b>funds</b> (EBFs), {{a large group of}} government entities that on average accounts for 40 to 45 percent of central government expenditure-two-thirds of which represents social security funds-in countries at various stages of development. If improperly designed and managed, EBFs can undermine effective fiscal control. However, they also bring potential benefits in the form of greater autonomy of decision-making in countries with well-established governance and financial management systems that have applied the "agency model" of devolved public management and fiscal control. The paper develops a typology of EBFs and argues that EBFs are frequently created because of failures in the budget system and political economy factors that need to be recognized and, where possible, corrected. The paper recommends that data on EBFs be consolidated within a unified system of fiscal reporting and proposes an analytical framework that governments might use to evaluate the effectiveness and utility of their EBFs.

The quarters were attributed to major Russian cities – Vladimir, Galich, Novgorod, Ustyug. The main purpose of the quarters consisted in levying taxes. Their whole organization had a financial nature, so they can be considered as financial management bodies. At the highest level, financial issues were resolved by the Zemsky Sobor, the Boyar Duma collegial bodies, which had a consultative character.

40|$|In Belarus, {{divestiture}} {{of social}} assets, a misnomer for fringe benefits that comprise {{a part of}} wages, is needed to transform enterprises so they can function appropriately in a market economy. Maintaining supply of these services after enterprise divestiture is an important public policy problem in transition economies. These fringe benefits, issued mainly {{in the form of}} housing and kindergarten services, were cut by at least two-thirds as a proportion of employee remuneration between 1994 and 1995 because of the economic downturn. This report debates whether most of these fringe benefits should continue to be subsidized or receive preferential tax treatment. A strong case is made for some government funding of the public health and kindergarten services, and public utility and housing services divested by enterprises. The reasons for assigning services such as education and health to local governments is debated and financing arrangements such as revenue sharing are examined. Among the problems cited with the latter are interregional imbalances caused by unequal resources distribution, tax breaks given to agriculture which has reduced payments to rural local governments, the absence of close links between beneficiaries and payers justifying <b>extrabudgetary</b> <b>funding,</b> and inadequate subnational government taxation raising insignificant amounts of revenue. Where transfers to local governments are required, formula financing is suggested for unconditional grants to low-income local governments and conditional grants to support specific objectives.

40|$|Kazakhstan’s {{government}} {{has established a}} comprehensive and efficient treasury system for government revenues and expenditures, and introduced a state-of-the-art government financial management information system. Kazakhstan is among the leading BRO (Baltics, Russia, and other Former Soviet Union) countries in modernizing its budget execution system despite remaining challenges {{in other areas of}} fiscal management. The successful outcomes are related partly to the high quality of the reform process, and partly to the institutional design of the Kazakh treasury. Some design features are common for most well-functioning treasuries. Other features are related to the specific economic factors, institutional features, and financial management objectives of a transition economy, with a strong emphasis on fiscal control and financial discipline.

Similar analyses have been done for Latin America, Europe, and the United States, but none {{in the context of}} low-income countries. Using public financial management indicators, as measured in two recent assessments related to the Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries Initiative, this study shows that improving public financial management leads to better fiscal outcomes, as measured by the overall fiscal balance and external debt levels, after controlling for other characteristics that might alter fiscal outcomes.
