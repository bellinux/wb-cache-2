40|$|The <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> of {{a diesel}} engine {{significantly}} affects the combustion characteristics, thus influencing the power output, fuel efficiency and the emissions. In this thesis work, simulations using {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) along with steady flow experiments were conducted to study the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> of a Yanmar NFD- 170 diesel engine. The in-cylinder air motion generated by the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> through the helical intake port was studied. In order to model {{the shape of the}} engine accurately, a three dimensional model of the engine intake port, cylinder head and cylinder was produced using AutoDesk Inventor. The air motion was simulated under steady flow conditions using Converge CFD software, and the simulation results were compared with the experimental results to validate the model. The results indicated that major features of the steady flow were well modeled at particular flow conditions...|$|R
40|$|A finite-difference {{procedure}} which {{solves the}} conservation equations of mass, momentum, and energy {{is used to}} investigate {{the effects of the}} compression ratio, engine speed, bore-to-stroke ratio, and air <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> angle on the turbulent flow field within an axisymmetric piston-cylinder configuration. It is shown that in a four-stroke piston-cylinder configuration, the intake stroke is characterized by the formation of a piston vortex. The piston vortex is stretched during the intake stroke, and the head vortex has an almost constant diameter. For a 0 -deg air <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> angle, both vortices disappear {{by the end of the}} compression stroke; for an air <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> angle of 45 deg, the flow field within the cylinder shows three elongated vortices which persist into the compression stroke and then break up and merge. It is also shown that larger bore-to-stroke ratios give rise to lower turbulent levels than smaller bore-to-stroke ratios and that the turbulent intensity is almost independent of the rpm...|$|R
40|$|The project {{described}} in this thesis was undertaken in order {{to contribute to the}} understanding of incompressible fluid flow through a flush entry S-bend intake duct as used for waterjet propulsion. Field tests using a planing hull test boat were carried out to investigate the operating conditions of a typical waterjet installation. Intake velocity ratios (IVR's), pump loading parameters, intake duct static pressure measurements, <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> directions and the ingested hull boundary layer characteristics are reported here. Wind tunnel tests modelling the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> through both the bare intake duct shape and the complete waterjet unit are also reported. The Reynolds number mismatch between these tests and the real waterjet installation is investigated and discussed. Numerical modelling of the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> was carried out using a turbulent viscous flow software package. The effects of varying the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> conditions, the Reynolds number of the calculation, the ingested boundary layer thickness and the turbulence model employed in the flow prediction are investigated. A thorough understanding of the <b>flow</b> through the <b>intake</b> has been developed. The flow features are discussed and their effects upon and relative importance to the overall performance of the waterjet are reported. A comparison between the field data and results from the wind tunnel tests and numerical modelling procedures is made. The relative merits of each modelling method are investigated and reported...|$|R

40|$|The flow in {{and around}} {{two-dimensional}} right-angled intake has been studied both experimentally and numerically. Pressure distributions on the intake surfaces are measured at various velocity ratios of the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> to the main flow, and the basic intake performances, such as the total pressure loss, the cavitation and the drag, are evaluated. It is shown that they are reproduced well by the numerical results with a standard k-ε model of turbulence, while the agreement becomes poorer as the velocity ratio becomes large. It is also demonstrated by the smoke-wire visualization study that the recirculating region formed upstream of the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> is reduced as the velocity ratio increases, contributing to the relative decrease in the total pressure loss at large velocity ratios...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{investigations}} of the in-cylinder flow pattern around the intake valve of a single-cylinder&# 13; internal combustion engine using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) at different <b>intake</b> air <b>flow</b> rates. The <b>intake</b> air&# 13; <b>flow</b> rates are corresponding to the three engine speeds of 1000, 2000 and 3000 rev/min., at all the static intake valve&# 13; opening conditions. In this study, in-cylinder flow structure {{is characterized by the}} tumble ratio and maximum&# 13; turbulent kinetic energy of the flow fields. In addition, at two specified lines of the combustion chamber, the radial&# 13; and axial velocity profiles have been plotted. From the results, it is found that the overall airflow direction at the exit&# 13; of the intake valve does not change significantly with the air <b>flow</b> rate and <b>intake</b> valve opening conditions. The&# 13; tumble ratio increases with increase in intake valve opening and not much affected by the change in the air flow rates. &# 13; It is also found that, the variations of the velocity profiles at the two specified lines are smooth at <b>full</b> <b>intake</b> valve&# 13; opening irrespective of the air flow rate. Also, their magnitudes increase with increase in the intake valve openings at&# 13; all the air flow rates. The in-cylinder flow analysis carried out in this study may be useful for optimizing the intake&# 13; valve opening of an internal combustion engine with respect to it’s speed...|$|R

40|$|A 'two dimensional' {{air intake}} comprisipg a wedge {{followed}} by an isentropic compression has been tested in the Cranfield Gun Tunnel at Mach 8, 2. These tests were performed to investigate qualitatively the <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> starting process. The effects of cowl position, Reynolds number, boundary-layer trip and introduction of a small restriction in the intake duct were investigated. Schlieren pictures of the flow on the compression surface and around the intake entrance were taken. Results showed that the intake would operate over the Reynolds number range tested. Tests with a laminar boundary layer demonstrated the principal influence of the Reynolds number on the boundary-layer growth and consequently on the flow structure in the intake entrance. In contrast boundary layer tripping produced little variation in flow pattern over the Reynolds number range tested. The cowl lip position appeared {{to have a strong}} effect on the intake performance. The only parameter which prevented the intake from starting was the introduction of a restriction in the intake duct.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} of a steady tangential vortex <b>intake</b> <b>flow.</b> The velocity field is measured with Laser Doppler Anemometry for the first time. It is found that the vortex <b>intake</b> <b>flow</b> pattern is basically divided into two regimes according to the variable drop shaft inflow velocity field. For a flow less than the free drainage discharge, the inflow does {{not interfere with the}} swirling flow in the drop shaft; the horizontal and vertical velocity of the inflow in the tapering channel varies linearly and parabolically with the vertical distance respectively. For larger discharges the inflow velocity field is notably modified by the drop shaft swirling flow. It is observed that the swirling flow possesses a stable and asymmetrical 'D' shaped air core with a throat located at the lowest level of the tapering channel. The tangential velocity of the swirling flow near the throat can be well-approximated by a Rankine vortex model in the region where the flow layer thickness is of the same order as the junction width; the vertical velocity of the swirling flow is approximately constant in the radial direction...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} {{changes have been}} made {{recently}} to improve the algorithms used for processing acoustic scintillation data for turbine discharge measurements, {{as a result of}} ongoing research into the factors affecting the accuracy of the method. These improvements are based on the results from a number of applications of the Acoustic Scintillation Flow Meter over the past two years, and encompass changes to both the instrument operation and the time series data processing. The effect of these changes is illustrated through a re-analysis of the data from acoustic scintillation flow measurements made in 2004 at Lower Granite Dam, a large, low-head plant on the Snake River in Washington State. Acoustic time-of-travel measurements in the intake and Winter-Kennedy differential pressure measurements were made at the same time.
