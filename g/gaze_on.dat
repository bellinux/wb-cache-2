The team jokingly suggested having Link shoot beams from his eyes before deciding to have him focus his <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> significant objects nearby, giving hints to observant players about what to do next.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{returned}} to operational flying in early 1941 in 616 Squadron, which was forming {{part of the}} Tangmere Wing. Johnson often found himself flying alongside Wing Commander Douglas Bader and Australian ace Tony <b>Gaze.</b> <b>On</b> 15 January 1941, Johnson, the recently appointed Squadron Leader Burton and Pilot Officer Hugh Dundas, who arrived back at the squadron on 13 September 1940, took off to offer cover for a convoy off North Coates. The controller vectored the pair onto an enemy aircraft, a Dornier Do 17. Both attacked the bomber and lost sight of it and each other. Although the controllers intercepted distress signals from the bomber Johnson did not see it crash. They were credited with one enemy aircraft damaged. It {{was the only time}} Johnson was to engage a German bomber. By the end of January, Johnson had added another 16.35 flying hours on Spitfires.|$|E

25|$|In 1831 the Admiralty issued {{orders for}} Victory {{to be broken}} up and her timbers reused in other vessels. A public outcry against the {{destruction}} of so famous a ship led to the order being held in abeyance and Victory was left, largely forgotten, at a Portsmouth mooring. Admiralty officially designated the ageing vessel as a ship's tender for the Port admirals flagship , and permitted civilian visitors to come aboard for tours. The ship briefly returned to the public <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> 18 July 1833 when the queen in waiting, Princess Victoria, and her mother, the Duchess of Kent, made a visit to her quarterdeck to meet with veterans of the Trafalgar campaign. This generated a surge {{of interest in the}} vessel, and an increase in civilian visitor numbers to between 10,000 and 12,000 a year. Victoria returned for a second visit on 21 October 1844, creating a further burst of interest that lifted annual visitors to more than 22,000.|$|E
25|$|Bhagwan Gopinath is {{not known}} to have made any formal disciples {{although}} {{he is said to}} have spiritually initiated a few seekers that would come to him seeking his spiritual tutelage. His method of initiation involved sharing his pipe or by transfixing his <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> them (called drishtipat). He would rarely initiate anyone by word of mouth although that {{is believed to be the}} commonly invoked method of initiation in Hinduism. He is known to have guided seekers based on their spiritual aptitude and receptivity in worshipping either saguna Brahman (God with form) or nirguna Brahman (God without form) and sometimes also help them choose their ideal of worship or veer them towards worshipping guru as Parabrahma (the ultimate reality). Though he would recommend saguna upasana for the beginners, he would eventually veer them towards nirguna upasana. Once in response to a question by his devotee as to whether saints should render help to people in spiritual and temporal spheres, he is known to have remarked that unlike a muscular animal who can easily swim across the river, a small insect would drown without help so they have to be helped. As such, his devotees gave him the epithet Jagadguru (spiritual guide of humanity).|$|E
25|$|During this stage, he is a {{said to have}} practised some {{technique}} of meditation that would seemingly help him control elements (called tattva) like fire and {{water out of the}} total 36 such elements enumerated in Kashmir Shaivism. He started the practice of blowing air at live charcoals in his fire pot (called kanger in local language) sometimes for hours together. He was found talking to and directing invisible people at times. Various parts of his body like his shoulders and knees were seen shuddering at times. He spiritually initiated a Sikh disciple who had come to see him from some other state and lived at his home for 3 months. He also initiated Pandit Maheshwar Nath Zutshi of Mallapore locality of Srinagar by offering him his pipe. He also started the practice of transfixing his <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> water filled in a tumbler kept inside a brass basin filled with water. This brass basin was placed over an earthenware pot which too was filled with water. It was also during this time that majority of his miracles were recorded and people started flocking him, seeking solutions to their worldly problems. It was sometime during the period between 1946–56 that he came to be called as Bhagwan by his devotees. He regularly visited the shrines of the deities of Mata Sharika Bhagwati and Mata Ragnya Bhawani during this period. Sometime after 1957, on every Sunday afternoon, musical concerts were held at his place by known local musicians who would play local and Indian classical music for him. Some of the other shrines visited by him during the initial and final stages of his spiritual practice were Jwala Ji at Khrew, Bhadrakali at Handwara, Jyestha Bhagwati at Srinagar, Gupt Ganga near Nishat Bagh, Tushkaraja Bhairav at Srinagar and Amarnath.|$|E

500|$|Although {{there is}} a strong {{suggestion}} in his letters that in his early years he had a sexual encounter with one of his models and possibly also a sexual encounter of some kind while in Venice in 1823–24, Etty was devoutly Christian and famously abstemious. Alison Smith considers the composition of Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret a conscious effort on his part to praise the virtue of chastity by creating a [...] "challenge for the presumably male viewer... to vanquish lust and cast a pure <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> vulnerable womanhood". Throughout his career Etty had championed the use of female models in life classes, creating some controversy, and this painting may have been intended to emphasise his belief that [...] "To the pure in heart all things are pure".|$|E
500|$|Queen Gertrude's two brothers, Ekbert, Bishop of Bamberg, and Henry II, Margrave of Istria, fled to Hungary in 1208 {{after they}} were accused of {{participating}} {{in the murder of}} Philip, King of the Germans. Andrew granted large domains to Bishop Ekbert in the Szepesség region (now Spiš, Slovakia). Gertrude's youngest brother, Berthold, had been Archbishop of Kalocsa since 1206; he was made Ban of Croatia and Dalmatia in 1209. Andrew's generosity towards his wife's German relatives and courtiers discontented the local lords. According to historian Gyula Kristó, the anonymous author of The Deeds of the Hungarians referred to the Germans from the Holy Roman Empire when he sarcastically mentioned that [...] " [...] the Romans <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> the goods of Hungary." [...] In 1209, Zadar, which had been lost to the Venetians, was liberated by one of Andrew's Dalmatian vassals, Domald of Sidraga, but the Venetians recaptured the town a year later.|$|E
500|$|During the winter, the Allies held {{a meeting}} at Corinth to {{celebrate}} their success, and award prizes for achievement. However, perhaps tired of the Athenians pointing out their role at Salamis, and of their demands for the Allies to march north, the Allies awarded the prize for civic achievement to Aegina. Furthermore, although the admirals all voted for Themistocles in second place, they all voted for themselves in first place, so that no-one won the prize for individual achievement. In response, realising {{the importance of the}} Athenian fleet to their security, and probably seeking to massage Themistocles's ego, the Spartans brought Themistocles to Sparta. There, he was awarded a special prize [...] "for his wisdom and cleverness", and won high praise from all. Furthermore, Plutarch reports that at the next Olympic Games: [...] " [...] Themistocles entered the stadium, the audience neglected the contestants all day long to <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> him, and pointed him out with admiring applause to visiting strangers, so that he too was delighted, and confessed to his friends that he was now reaping in full measure the harvest of his toils in behalf of Hellas." ...|$|E

The play is introduced with a short orchestral passage featuring a saxophone solo. (According to Annegret Fauser this is the first instance of the use of a saxophone in an opera.) In an aside Hamlet asks Marcellus to watch the King (Hamlet: Voici l'instant! fixez vos regards sur le Roi, et, si vous le voyez pâlir, dites-le moi! [...] "Now!

2500|$|By 1580, {{not only}} had the [...] "universal ruler" [...] subdued all the {{countries}} which had occupied his attention {{for the last three}} decades but he also had the respect from neighboring states. He faced no internal or external threats (although Portuguese Goa considered it was technically at war with Burma for her interference in Ceylon). Instead of resting, he turned his <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> Arakan, the kingdom he and Tabinshwehti unsuccessfully tried to conquer in 1545–1547. He determined that it was now time to reduce the western coastal kingdom to the vassal status it held under the Pagan kings once more. A year earlier, he had sent an embassy to Emperor Akbar of the Mughal Empire, which had just acquired Bengal in 1576, perhaps to ascertain whether his occupation of Arakan would be viewed as an act of hostility to the Mughals.|$|E

2500|$|Affective piety is most {{commonly}} {{described as a}} style of highly emotional devotion to the humanity of Jesus, particularly in his infancy and his death, and to the joys and sorrows of the Virgin Mary. It was {{a major influence on}} many varieties of devotional literature in late-medieval Europe, both in Latin and in the vernaculars.: This practice of prayer, reading, and meditation was often cultivated through concentration on vivid images of scenes from the Bible, Saints' Lives, and other religious material. These images could be either conjured up in people's minds when they read or heard poetry and other pieces of religious literature, or they could <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> manuscript illuminations and other pieces of art as they prayed and meditated on the scenes depicted. [...] In either case, this style of affective meditation asked the [...] "viewer" [...] to engage with the scene as if she or he were physically present and to stir up feelings of love, fear, grief, and/or repentance for sin.|$|E
2500|$|As the Earth {{turns around}} its axis, {{everything}} {{attached to it}} turns with it (imperceptibly to our senses). An object that is moving without being dragged along with this rotation travels in a straight motion over the turning Earth. From our rotating perspective on the planet, its direction of motion changes as it moves, bending {{in the opposite direction}} to our actual motion. When viewed from a stationary point in space directly above the north pole, any land feature in the Northern Hemisphere turns anticlockwise—and, fixing our <b>gaze</b> <b>on</b> that location, any other location in that hemisphere rotates around it the same way. The traced ground path of a freely moving body travelling from one point to another therefore bends the opposite way, clockwise, which is conventionally labeled as [...] "right," [...] where it will be if the direction of motion is considered [...] "ahead," [...] and [...] "down" [...] is defined naturally.|$|E

[...] Although there had been attempts to construct what had previously been called an [...] "aquatic vivarium" [...] (a name Gosse found [...] "awkward and uncouth"), Gosse published The Aquarium in 1854 and set off a mid-Victorian craze for household aquariums. The book was financially profitable for Gosse, and [...] "the reviews were full of praise" [...] even though Gosse used natural science to point to the necessity of salvation through the blood of Christ. In 1856 Gosse was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, which, because he had no university position or inherited wealth, gave him [...] "a standing he otherwise lacked." ...|$|E
