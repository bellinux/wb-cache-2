40|$|<b>Drape</b> is {{a unique}} {{property}} that allows a fabric to be bent {{in more than one}} direction with double curvature. For many years, researchers studied fabric <b>drape</b> in order to evaluate the aesthetic performance of finished garments. However, the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> may not be same as the behaviour of garment <b>drape</b> stand on the same object by visually observation. Such difference would affect the prediction of garment <b>drape</b> based on fabric <b>drape.</b> At present, the study of the difference between the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> is very limited. This study aims to examine the difference of the behaviour of fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> through <b>drape</b> coefficient analysis and <b>drape</b> profile analysis. The effects of fabric mechanical properties on fabric <b>drape</b> and garment <b>drape</b> are also investigated experimentally.

40|$|<b>Drape</b> {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors influencing the aesthetics and functionality of fabrics. Therefore, investigation into <b>drape</b> parameters is important for analysing its behaviour. <b>Drape</b> parameters were investigated from different aspects using the Cusick <b>Drape</b> meter and Image Analyser. Firstly, the influence of time on the <b>drape</b> coefficient and number of folds was studied over 24 hours. Usually, <b>drape</b> is considered as a static, time-independent problem. However, this investigation shows that the <b>drape</b> coefficient of a fabric changes si-gnificantly over a longer time period. Furthermore, the comparison of <b>drape</b> parameters is shown using samples with two different diameters. The larger samples have smaller <b>drape</b> coefficient than those with smaller diameters, and their <b>drape</b> is less changeable over time. Basically, the three-dimensional fabric <b>drape</b> is not an independent fabric property, there-fore, the connection between bending rigidity and drapecoefficient was studied. The last aspect of this investigation was the repeatability of <b>drape</b> measurements, and the establish-ment of the required number of measurements for <b>drape</b> coefficient and fold numbers...|$|R

40|$|<b>Drape</b> of {{the fabric}} {{is its ability to}} hang freely in graceful folds when some area of it is {{supported}} over a surface and the rest is unsupported. <b>Drape</b> is a unique property that allows a fabric to be bent in more than in one direction, When two-dimensional fabric are converted to three-dimensional garment form. In the present study, the effects of sewing of different seam were selected on different fabric and their behaviors were studied. In this study <b>drape</b> of ten fabrics are analyzed with three types of seams and three stitch densities. Sample without seam is a control sample and <b>drape</b> of seamed samples are compared with control sample to analyse the <b>drape</b> behavior of seamed fabrics. This paper presents a fundamental <b>drape</b> analysis of seamed fabrics using <b>drape</b> meter. <b>Drape</b> behavior is determined in terms of <b>drape</b> coefficient.

The <b>drape</b> coefficient is the widely used parameter to describe fabric <b>drape</b> but it needs other parameters to explain the fabric behavior. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between the fabric <b>drape</b> parameters such as <b>drape</b> coefficient, <b>drape</b> distance ratio, fold depth index, amplitude and number of nodes and low stress mechanical properties. <b>Drape</b> parameters were tested on a specially developed instrument based on a digital image processing technique and the low stress mechanical properties were tested by the Kawabata evaluation system. Then the <b>drape</b> parameters were predicted by constructing models using multiple regressions method and feed-forward back-propagation neural network technique. Simple equations are derived using regressions method to predict the five shape parameters of <b>drape</b> profile from the low stress mechanical properties. It is observed that bending, shear and aerial density affect the <b>drape</b> parameters most whereas the tensile and compression have little effect on the <b>drape</b> parameters.

Poor correlation is seen with other parameters. These outcomes can be used to improve garment designing applications...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of the <b>drape</b> properties of fabrics on final garment appearance and fit has been long understood {{and a great deal}} of research has been carried out in this area. More recently, nonwoven fabrics have begun to create interest among the apparel and fashion design community. In this study, the conventional method of measuring fabric <b>drape</b> was compared with garment <b>drape</b> measurement using an alternative <b>drape</b> measurement system based on an image analysis technique. Garment <b>drape</b> was investigated using dresses suspended on a mannequin. A garment chosen was a shift dress because of its relatively uncomplicated style and shape. Hydroentangled nonwovens were selected as they show good performance and similarity to conventional fabrics in terms of physical and mechanical properties. A graphical user interface was developed to carry out the image analysis and to calculate <b>drape</b> values identifying and determining 23 <b>drape</b> parameters. A range of fabrics including conventional (knitted, woven) and nonwoven fabrics were compared in terms of FAST properties, <b>drape</b> coefficient and <b>drape</b> values. Some nonwoven fabrics were found to give similar performance to some conventional fabrics and better than others. Subjective assessment of the fabric range was carried out in terms of <b>drape</b> amount and preference. Low agreement was found between individuals with regard to preferred <b>drape</b> amount and high agreement with respect to actual <b>drape</b> amount. Nonwovens were found to be better preferred over some conventional fabrics. Most of the <b>drape</b> values of fabric and garment were found to have poor correlations...|$|R

5|$|Peake's {{portrait}} of Lady Elizabeth Pope {{may have been}} commissioned by her husband, Sir William Pope, to commemorate their marriage in 1615. Lady Elizabeth is portrayed with her hair loose, a symbol of bridal virginity.• See also Stewart, Cradle King, 113. She wears a <b>draped</b> mantle—embroidered with seed pearls in a pattern of ostrich plumes—and a matching turban. The mantle knotted on one shoulder was worn in Jacobean court masques, as the costume designs of Inigo Jones indicate. The painting’s near-nudity, however, makes the depiction of an actual masque costume unlikely.• Ribeiro, Fashion and Fiction, 89. Loose hair and the classical <b>draped</b> mantle also figure in contemporary personifications of abstract concepts in masques and paintings. Yale art historian Ellen Chirelstein argues that Peake is portraying Lady Elizabeth as a personification of America, since her father, Sir Thomas Watson, was a major shareholder in the Virginia Company.|$|E

40|$|Shape {{factors of}} a tight skirt and 3 kinds of flared skirts were {{investigated}} precisely.

They were also compared with node number and static <b>drape</b> coefficient of skits at hem line. Following conclusions were obtained. In the case of tight skirt, flare- 1 skirt and flare- 2 skirt, the shape factor showed high correlation with <b>drape</b> parameters of the skirts and circular fabrics. The shape factor of skirts has high positive correlation with node number and negative correlation with static <b>drape</b> coefficient of circular fabrics. In the case of flare- 3 skirt, there is no correlation between the shape factor and the <b>drape</b> parameters of circular fabrics and skirts, hence shape factor becomes an important parameter which can evaluate the appearance of flared skirt objectively...|$|R
