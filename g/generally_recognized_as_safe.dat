5|$|While {{classified}} as <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> in the US, juniper berries may have various side effects {{that have not}} been tested extensively in clinical trials. Mainly due to an increased risk of miscarriage, even in small doses, consuming juniper berries may affect pregnant or breastfeeding women and people with diabetes, bleeding disorders or after surgery. In traditional medicine, juniper berries were used for female birth control. In an in vitro study, juniper essential oil was studied for its possible antimicrobial and antifungal properties.|$|E
5|$|The {{product is}} {{regulated}} in different manners in various regions. In the US, {{the product is}} allowed {{to be used in}} ground beef, and it can be used in other meat products such as beef-based processed meats. The use of ammonia as an anti-microbial agent is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and is included on the FDA's list of GRAS (<b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> <b>safe)</b> procedures, and is used in similar applications for numerous other food products, including puddings and baked goods. The product is banned in Canada due to the presence of ammonia in it, and it is banned for human consumption in the European Union. Some consumer advocacy groups have promoted the elimination of the product or for mandatory disclosure of additives in beef, while others have expressed concerns about plant closures that occurred after the product received significant news media coverage.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports for}} the first time on the {{capacity}} of a wine Lactobacillus plantarum strain to alter the oxidative coloration of (þ) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin hydroethanolic wine model solutions in the presence of Fe 2 þ as catalyst. The time course of color development and pigment formation in the solutions was tracked over 42 days. The pigments formed were characterized as xanthylium structures regardless of the flavanol isomer present in the solution. The solutions supplied with Lactobacillus plantarum RM 71 were oxidized at a slower rate, and consequently, its final color was less than that in the controls. The formation of both (þ) -catechin and (-) -epicatechin-derived xanthylium pigments was also delayed over time in the presence of the bacterium compared to their respective cell-free controls. The delaying effects provided by L. plantarum on the oxidative coloration and the generation of xanthylium-derived pigments were more pronounced for the (-) -epicatechin than for the (þ) -catechin model solutions. In view of these results and given that L. plantarum is naturally present in winemaking and <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> a <b>safe</b> microorganism, the potential application of this bacterium as an antibrowning agent for wine is now openedPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Glycerol or {{glycerin}} is <b>generally</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> a <b>safe</b> compound {{to be used}} {{in animal}} feed, especially for ruminants. A number of in vitro studies related to glycerol supplementation in ruminant ration have been published but to date the results have not been summarized. The objective of this study was, therefore, to evaluate in vitro digestibility, ruminal fermentation characteristics, total gas and methane production through the meta-analysis approach. Meta-analysis was applied to 13 experiments and 42 treatments dealing with glycerol supplementation in ruminants. Data were analyzed by general linear model procedure in which the glycerol levels and the different studies were treated as fixed effects. Results revealed that glycerol supplementation did not affect the in vitro digestibility and total VFA production, but significantly decreased molar proportion of acetate and iso-valerate (P< 0. 05). In contrast, molar proportion of propionate, butyrate, and valerate significantly increased, and thus the ratio of acetate to propionate declined linearly (P< 0. 05). Methane production decreased linearly and accompanied with an increase of total gas production with increasing levels of glycerol supplementation (P< 0. 05). It is concluded that the use of glycerol as an energy substitution in animal feed has no detrimental effects in the rumen and environmentally friendly...|$|R

25|$|The perfume {{industry}} in the US is not directly regulated by the FDA, instead the FDA controls the safety of perfumes through their ingredients and requires that they be tested {{to the extent that}} they are <b>Generally</b> <b>recognized</b> <b>as</b> <b>safe</b> (GRAS). Due to the need for protection of trade secrets, companies rarely give the full listing of ingredients regardless of their effects on health. In Europe, as from 11 March 2005, the mandatory listing of a set of 26 recognized fragrance allergens was enforced. The requirement to list these materials is dependent on the intended use of the final product. The limits above which the allegens are required to be declared are 0.001% for products intended to remain on the skin, and 0.01% for those intended to be rinsed off. This has resulted in many old perfumes like chypres and fougère classes, which require the use of oakmoss extract, being reformulated.|$|E
