Consequently, most organizations carefully examine their processes, streamline them, and remove bottlenecks wherever possible. Often {{the result is}} a better organized version of the original process. Conversely, over-streamlining can also cause less actual data to be collected and cause materials to not be fully optimized. The challenge is how to conduct more developmental work with less effort. In the development or qualification of a pressure sensitive tape, most of us follow a very traditional process. Formulations are blended, draw downs are prepared, and various PSTC test methods are used to decide which adhesive and/or construction will meet a need.

40|$|Background Bladder {{cancer has}} the {{peculiarity}} of shedding neoplastic cells and their components in urine representing a valuable opportunity to detect diagnostic markers. Using a semi-quantitative method we previously {{demonstrated that the}} levels of Tyr-phosphorylated proteins (TPPs) are highly increased in bladder cancer tissues and that soluble TPPs can also be detected in patient's urine samples. Although the preliminary evaluation showed very promising specificity and sensitivity, insufficient accuracy and very low throughput of the method halted the diagnostic evaluation of the new marker. To overcome this problem we developed a quantitative methodology with high sensitivity and accuracy to measure TPPs in urine. Methods The Immobilized Metal Affinity Chromatography (IMAC) was miniaturized in a 96 well format. Luminescence, visible and infrared fluorescence antibody-based detection methods were comparatively evaluated. Results Due to their low abundance we evidenced that both phosphoprotein enrichment step and very sensitive detection methods are required to detect TPPs in urine samples. To pursue high throughput, reproducibility and cost containment, which are required for bladder cancer screening programs, we coupled the pre-analytical IMAC procedure with high sensitive detection phases (infrared fluorescence or chemiluminescence) in an automated platform. Conclusions A <b>high</b> <b>throughput</b> <b>method</b> for measuring with high sensitivity TPP levels in urine samples is now available for large clinical trial {{for the establishment of}} the diagnostic and predictive power of TPPs as bladder cancer marker.

40|$|IntroductionWe {{developed}} a <b>high</b> <b>throughput</b> <b>method</b> for estimating smoker 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s mainstream smoke intake on a per-cigarette basis by analyzing discarded cigarette butts. This new method utilizes ultraviolet/visible (UV-Vis) spectrophotometric analysis of isopropanol-soluble smoke particulate matter extracted from discarded cigarette filters. MethodsWhen measured under {{a wide range}} of smoking conditions for a given brand variant, smoking machine delivery of nicotine, benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and tobacco-specific nitrosamines can be related to the overall filter extract absorbance at 360 nm. Once this relationship has been established, UV-Vis analysis of a discarded cigarette filter butt gives a quantitative measure of a smoker 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s exposure to these analytes. ResultsThe measured mainstream smoke constituents correlated closely (correlation coefficients from 0. 9303 to 0. 9941) with the filter extract absorbance. These high correlations held over {{a wide range of}} smoking conditions for 2 R 4 F research cigarettes as well as popular domestic cigarette brands sold in the United States. ConclusionsThis low cost, <b>high</b> <b>throughput</b> <b>method</b> is suitable for high volume analyses (hundreds of samples per day) because UV-Vis spectrophotometry, rather than mass spectrometry, is used for the cigarette filter butt analysis. This method provides a stable and noninvasive means for estimating mouth-level delivery of many mainstream smoke constituents. The ability to gauge the mouthlevel intake of harmful chemicals and total mainstream smoke for cigarette smokers in a natural setting on a cigarette-by-cigarette basis can provide insights on factors contributing to morbidity and mortality from cigarette smoking, as well as insights on strategies related to smoking cessation.
