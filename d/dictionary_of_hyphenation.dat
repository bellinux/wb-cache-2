40|$|Historical corpora are {{important}} resources for different areas. Philology, Human Language Technology, Literary Studies, History, and Lexicography {{are some that}} benefit from them. However, compiling historical corpora is different from compiling contemporary corpora. Corpus designers {{have to deal with}} several characteristics inherent in historical texts, such as: absence of a spelling standard, pervasive use of abbreviations plus their spelling variations, lack of space between words, irregular use <b>of</b> <b>hyphenation,</b> non-standard typographical symbols. This paper addresses the challenges posed in processing the corpus designed for the Historical <b>Dictionary</b> <b>of</b> Brazilian Portuguese (HDBP) project, which is composed of texts from the sixteenth through the beginning of the nineteenth century, and the solutions found to support the compilation of a Historical Portuguese dictionary based on this corpus...|$|R
40|$|Significant {{progress}} has been made in the <b>hyphenation</b> ability <b>of</b> TEX since its first version in 1978. However, in practice, we still face problems in many languages such as Czech, German, Swedish etc. when trying to adopt local typesetting industry standards. In this paper we discuss problems <b>of</b> <b>hyphenation</b> in multilingual documents in general, we show how we've made Czech and Slovak hyphenation patterns and we describe our results achieved using the program PATGEN for hyphenation pattern generation. We show that <b>hyphenation</b> <b>of</b> compound words may be partially solved even within the scope of TEX 82. We discuss possible enhancements of the process <b>of</b> <b>hyphenation</b> pattern generation and describe features that might be reasonable to think about to be incorporated in or another successor to TEX 82...|$|R

40|$|Intuitions about {{syllable}} structure {{have direct}} {{implications for the}} practical problem <b>of</b> <b>hyphenation.</b> Bruce Derwing's work on the syllable, spelling rules, and the influence of orthography in English phonological judgments is extended here to an unwritten language without accepted conventions <b>of</b> <b>hyphenation.</b> Predictions based on different principles of syllable division and standard German hyphenation rules vary for words with certain syllable forms. The judgments of syllable breaks in bisyllabic Swiss German words made by both naïve Swiss children and Swiss translation college students are well predicted by the obligatory onset principle described in the new German rules. These rules, with a minor adjustment for intervocalic stop-liquid clusters allowed word-initially, are recommended for Swiss German hyphenation. Syllable Breaks in Swiss German: Implications for Hyphenation Few dispute the psychological reality of the syllable, or its usefulness as a linguistic construct to describe phonological processes (see Kahn, 1976, for a good review), but many have discussed the difficulty in determining its boundaries in multisyllabic words...|$|R
