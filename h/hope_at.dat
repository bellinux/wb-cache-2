5|$|Although the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition was {{traditionally}} {{the most prestigious}} venue for English artists to display their new material, Watts chose to exhibit <b>Hope</b> <b>at</b> the smaller Grosvenor Gallery. In 1882 the Grosvenor Gallery had staged a retrospective exhibition of Watts's work and he felt an attachment to the venue. Also, at this time the Grosvenor Gallery was generally more receptive than the Royal Academy to experimentation. Hope was given the prime spot in the exhibition, in {{the centre of the}} gallery's longest wall.|$|E

5|$|In 1936, US25 {{was changed}} to traffic along a one-way pairing of streets on the {{southwest}} side of Port Huron. Northbound traffic remained on Military Avenue while southbound traffic was diverted to Electric Avenue. Two US25A routings were created in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first, near Erie, was numbered in 1937, and renumbered US24A by 1945. The second in Port Huron provided access to the Blue Water Bridge from the mainline of the highway starting in 1940. That last segment of US25 to be paved was completed near Port <b>Hope</b> <b>at</b> {{the end of the}} 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, a {{graduated}} Steffy {{returns to}} Los Angeles and begins {{working for the}} family fashion house, Forrester Creations. She briefly dates Marcus Walton (Texas Battle), and discovers {{that he is the}} son of Brooke's sister, Donna Logan (Jennifer Gareis). Phoebe is {{killed in a car accident}} after the car she was driving with her boyfriend Rick swerves off the road. Steffy mourns the loss of Phoebe and begins a romance with Rick to feel closer to Phoebe. Her family are horrified and eventually break up the relationship. When businessman Bill Spencer, Jr. (Don Diamont) takes over Forrester Creations, Steffy seduces him, (who is married to Katie Logan (Heather Tom), (Brooke's sister) in order to win the company back for the Forresters in February 2010, ensuring that the Logan sisters have been excluded as owners. Steffy takes an interest in Oliver (Zack Conroy)who is dating Brooke's daughter, Hope Logan (Kimberly Matula), but Oliver rejects her. At a pool party, Brooke has sex with Oliver, believing he was Ridge and he believing she was <b>Hope.</b> <b>At</b> Hope's graduation party, a tape supposedly narrated by Steffy appears to expose this scandal. After Ridge consequently fires Steffy from Forrester Creations, Taylor compensates by signing over her 25% shares to Steffy. However, it is soon revealed that Steffy's narration was manipulated by computer expert Liam Spencer (Scott Clifton), who is Bill's son. Steffy forgives Liam and later develops feelings for him, but he begins a romance with Hope who will not have sex with him until marriage. Steffy travels to Paris for an extended business trip.|$|E
5|$|The weaker {{members of}} the party—Arnold Spencer-Smith and Mackintosh himself—were by this time showing signs of {{physical}} breakdown, as the long march south began from Bluff Depot towards Mount <b>Hope</b> <b>at</b> 83°30S, where the final depot was to be laid. The party was reduced to six when three men were forced to turn back because of a Primus stove failure. With Mackintosh and Joyce in the final party were Spencer-Smith, Ernest Wild (younger brother of Frank), Dick Richards and Victor Hayward. With four dogs they trekked southward, increasingly afflicted by frostbite, snow blindness and, eventually, scurvy. Spencer-Smith collapsed, and thereafter had to be carried on the sledge. Mackintosh, barely able to walk, fought on until the final depot was laid at Mount Hope. On the homeward journey the effective leadership of the party fell increasingly to Joyce, as Mackintosh's condition deteriorated until, like Spencer-Smith, {{he had to be}} carried on the sledge. The journey became a protracted struggle which eventually cost the life of Spencer-Smith and took the others to the limits of their endurance. Mackintosh suffered further physical and mental collapse, and had to be left in the tent while Joyce, himself suffering from severe snow blindness, led the rest to the safety of Hut Point. He and Ernest Wild then returned for Mackintosh, and the five survivors were all back at Hut Point on 18 March 1916.|$|E

25|$|While {{the term}} Lower Mainland has been {{recorded}} from the earliest period of non-native settlement in British Columbia, {{it has never been}} officially defined in legal terms.

25|$|The epic {{begins with}} a {{dedication}} section, with the poet paying homage to Virgil and Homer. The first line mimics the opening line of the Aeneid, and pays a hopeful tribute to the young King Sebastião. The story, then (in imitation of the classical epics) portrays the gods of Greece watching over the voyage of Vasco da Gama. Just as the gods had divided loyalties during the voyages of Odysseus and Aeneas, here Venus, who favors the Portuguese, is opposed by Bacchus, who is here associated with the east and resents the encroachment on his territory. We encounter Vasco da Gama's voyage in medias res as they have already rounded the Cape of Good <b>Hope.</b> <b>At</b> the urging of Bacchus, who is disguised as a Moor, the local Muslims plot to attack the explorer and his crew.|$|E
25|$|In 1978 Clare stormed {{through the}} National League again and {{qualified}} for the final {{for the third year}} in-a-row. Once again Kilkenny provided the opposition and, once again, an interesting game ensued. Clare's ability to get goals once proved the defining feature of a close game as McCarthy's side went on to win by 3–10 to 1–10. This victory buoyed up Clare for the provincial championship where they qualified for a second consecutive Munster showdown with Cork. Over 54,000 spectators turned up at Semple Stadium that day to see Clare attempt to dethrone Cork. At half-time it looked as if Clare were about to triumph as they trailed by 0–5 to 0–3 after Cork recorded thirteen wides. With ten minutes left Cork led by five points, however, a late rally gave Clare some <b>hope.</b> <b>At</b> the full-time whistle Cork still had a narrow 0–13 to 0–11 win.|$|E
25|$|When Pennsylvania first legislated {{routes in}} 1911, {{what is now}} PA 32 was {{designated}} as part of Legislative Route 252 between Morrisville and Yardley. PA 32 was designated in 1927 to run between Philadelphia and US 611/PA 2 in Kintnersville, heading northeast along US 13 to Morrisville before turning northwest on its present alignment. At this time, the entire route was paved. In 1928, the southern terminus was cut back to US 1 (Bridge Street) in Morrisville, removing the concurrency with US 13. In 1932, a parkway was proposed along the route from Morrisville to New Hope; however, it was never built. In 1969, another proposal was created for a $30million PA 32 freeway from I-95 near Yardley to US 202 in New <b>Hope.</b> <b>At</b> the time, this freeway was {{to be completed by}} 1985. However, the proposal never came about. In the 1980s, PA 32 was extended southwest to its current terminus, replacing a part of US 1 Alt., which had replaced the earlier US 1 designation, on Bridge Street.|$|E

25|$|Ali and Mason then chipped {{away at the}} Northamptonshire batsmen, {{and would}} have fancied their chances when the {{visitors}} were 64 for 5. However, a quickfire partnership between Sales and Wright turned the match on its head again, as the pair added 188 runs in 112 minutes - one run less than Northamptonshire had managed in the entire first innings - to send Northamptonshire into a relatively big lead on this pitch. Sales was 152 not out overnight, and powered on to 190 before Malik had him caught. However, the damage was done, and Worcestershire faced a steep target of 360 to win - or five sessions for a draw. Losing Moore and Graeme Hick early on, Ben Smith attacked for a fine 92, and a 45-minute flurry of runs from Zander de Bruyn gave Worcestershire some <b>hope</b> <b>at</b> 154 for 3. However, Monty Panesar got four for 40, Phillips dug out three for 56, Worcestershire lost the last seven wickets for 68 runs, and whimpered into a heap. Worcestershire were later docked one point due to a slow over rate.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps, {{the biggest}} upset {{in the history}} of One Day Internationals, Mashrafe Mortaza shocked the Sophia Gardens crowd when he had Adam Gilchrist plumb on the second ball of the second ODI, taking the first Australian wicket without a run yet on the {{scoreboard}} – and it was to set the tone of the match. Most people would have expected Australia to swamp Bangladesh, especially after the 10-wicket defeat the Bangladeshi Tigers endured in the opening match with England, but a maiden from Mortaza gave them some <b>hope,</b> <b>at</b> least. Things looked to be going the right way for Australia when Matthew Hayden took a boundary off Tapash Baisya, but another maiden followed, and in the sixth over Ricky Ponting padded up to Tapash Baisya – resulting in an lbw decision given, and Australia were 9 for 2. Cautious batting from Hayden and Damien Martyn followed, but some expensive bowling from Baisya relinquished the initiative, as Australia recovered. They survived through 15 overs, Hayden being caught off a no-ball from Tapash, but in the 16th, he was bowled by Nazmul Hossain for 37 off an inside edge, just as Hayden were looking to get himself in. Some economical bowling from Mohammad Rafique who bowled ten overs for 31 runs, along with excellent bowling from Mortaza at the death, resulted in Australia finishing on 249 for 5, losing Martyn to Baisya for 77 and Clarke to the same man for 54. In fact, Michael Hussey with 31 not out off 21 balls and Simon Katich with 36 not out off 23 ensured that they got a competitive target.|$|E
500|$|During the Peninsular War, the 52nd {{fulfilled}} their {{dual role}} as line and light infantry by contributing to fortress assault parties. The companies {{that led the}} breach assaults were known as the [...] "Forlorn Hope", (from the Dutch [...] "verloren hoop" [...] (lost troop)). It was deemed an act of high honour, since the lead troops faced the greatest danger. The 52nd contributed to the Forlorn <b>Hope</b> <b>at</b> the sieges of Ciudad Rodrigo, Badajoz (1812) and San Sebastian. Officers and sergeants who survived would be very likely be put up for battlefield promotions (although it was not assured) while other ranks would receive laurels from their commander also with the chance of promotion being greatly increased. The 52nd, however, offered its own recognition: those who survived the Forlorn <b>Hope</b> <b>at</b> Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz were entitled to wear on their right arm a badge displaying a laurel wreath and the letters [...] "V.S." [...] for [...] "Valiant Stormer". This honour was awarded by the 52nd's commanding officer, and was restricted to the 52nd.|$|E
