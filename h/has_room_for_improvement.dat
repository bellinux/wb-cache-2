A minimum spanning tree algorithm is employed to compute {{an estimate of the}} conditional entropy in higher dimensions. The paper includes the theory to motivate the proposed similarity measure. Experimental results indicate that the suggested method can achieve a more robust and accurate registration compared to similarity measures that don’t include spatial information. ...|$|E
