5|$|Geoffrey Rush as Captain Hector Barbossa: The former {{captain of}} the Black Pearl is resurrected during this film; however, he does not appear until the final shot before the credits. Having met his demise in the {{previous}} installment, Barbossa is resurrected by Tia Dalma and agrees to rescue Jack Sparrow {{in order to save}} the Black Pearl. For this role, Rush was uncredited to keep his return a surprise. The DVD commentary said that not even the cast of the movie knew that Rush would return his character, and that the expressions on the characters' faces when seeing him for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years were real.|$|E
5|$|Both teams {{went into}} the match as the champions of their {{respective}} countries – {{the first time that}} the final had been contested by domestic champions since 1999, when Manchester United beat Bayern Munich 2–1 at Barcelona's home, the Camp Nou – both winning with games to spare. Manchester United won their 11th Premier League title with a 0–0 draw at home to Arsenal on 16 May, while Barcelona were confirmed as La Liga champions for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years when Real Madrid lost to Villarreal on the same day. Both Manchester United and Barcelona were also looking for another Champions League title to cap a season in which they had won multiple trophies: Manchester United had already won four out of a possible seven trophies in 2008–09 and were playing for the possibility of becoming the third team to retain the European Double (the domestic league and the European Cup), while Barcelona were aiming to become the first Spanish club to win a Treble of La Liga, the Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{began the}} 1944 Philadelphia Athletics {{season as a}} member of the {{starting}} rotation along with Don Black, Lum Harris and Bobo Newsom. However, he did split time in the first half of the year between the starting rotation and the bullpen. Among those appearances was a 16-inning match against the Chicago White Sox; Christopher pitched the final four innings, losing 4–2 after Hal Trosky stole home plate. On July 14, he pitched a 4–3 victory against the Senators, helping his team defeat Hall of Fame pitcher Early Wynn for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years. After starting the season with a 4–10 record, on July 22 Christopher went on a seven-game winning streak that culminated with a 5–1 complete game victory over the White Sox. He finished the season with a 14–14 record, 84 strikeouts and an ERA of 2.97. After the season ended, Christopher and others went on a barnstorming tour throughout the United States, ending in Wenatchee, Washington.|$|E

5|$|Del Potro {{decided to}} skip the Australian Open and made his season debut at the Delray Beach Open, where he was seeded in a tournament for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years, at No. 7, and won his first three matches against Kevin Anderson, Damir Dzumhur and Sam Querrey, who beat him in the semifinals of the same tournament last year. However, in the semifinals this year, del Potro lost to top seed and world No. 4 Milos Raonic in {{straight}} sets. Next, del Potro played in the Mexican Open, where {{he was drawn to}} play qualifier Frances Tiafoe, who idolised del Potro when he was a child. In the end, del Potro won an extremely tight match in three sets. In the next round, del Potro played the top seed of the tournament {{for the second time in}} a row. This time it was Novak Djokovic on the other side of the court. Del Potro lost in three sets after winning the first set.|$|E
5|$|Linden {{made his}} NHL debut on October 6, 1988 against the Winnipeg Jets, aged 18. He scored his first goal on October 18, 1988, against Kelly Hrudey of the New York Islanders and later, on November 17, he scored his first hat trick against the Minnesota North Stars. Linden {{finished}} the season {{tied for the}} team lead in goals (30) and second for points (59). He was the first Canucks rookie to score 30 goals and came within one point of tying Ivan Hlinka's team record of 60 points as a first-year player, set in 1981–82 (the record was later tied by Pavel Bure in 1991–92). Linden also became the first rookie to win the Cyclone Taylor Award, given to the Canucks' most valuable player. He {{was named to the}} NHL All-Rookie Team, and finished second to Brian Leetch, of the New York Rangers, in voting for the Calder Trophy, given to the rookie of the year. Fans voted him as the winner of The Hockey News rookie of the year award. The Canucks made the playoffs in the 1988–89 season, for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years, and Linden scored seven points in the Canucks' seven-game series loss to the eventual Stanley Cup champion Calgary Flames.|$|E
5|$|Nelson {{entered the}} FA Cup, the {{foremost}} cup competition in England, in the Fifth Qualifying Round {{along with all}} the other teams in the Third Division North. For their first match, played on 29 November 1924, the team was drawn to play Winsford United of the Cheshire County League at Seedhill. Nelson won the first ever meeting between the two clubs 4–1 with goals from Braidwood, Eddleston, O'Beirne and Wolstenholme, to progress to the Sixth Qualifying Round for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years. In the next round Nelson were again given a home tie, against Second Division outfit Coventry City, who would be relegated to the Third Division North {{at the end of the}} 1924–25 campaign. Nelson made only one change from the side that had defeated Winsford, with Eddie Cameron replacing Arthur Wolstenholme. In front of a crowd of 7,000 spectators, one of the highest attendances at Seedhill of the season, Coventry won 1–0 to progress to the first round proper of the competition.|$|E

5|$|O'Sullivan {{captured}} {{two more}} ranking {{titles in the}} 1997/1998 season. By beating three-time defending champion Stephen Hendry 10–6 in the final, O'Sullivan won his second UK Championship title. O'Sullivan also triumphed at the Scottish Open by defeating John Higgins 9–5 in the final. For the third year in a row, O'Sullivan made {{the final of the}} Charity Challenge. He was defeated, like the year previous, in a final frame decider, 8–9 to John Higgins. For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years O'Sullvian did not reach the final at the Masters, losing to Steve Davis. After defeating Ken Doherty 9–3 in the final of the Irish Masters, a post-match drug test found traces of cannabis in his system. O'Sullivan was stripped of the title, forfeited of the prize money and the title was awarded to Doherty by the WPBSA. O'Sullivan reached the World Championship semi-finals {{for the second time in}} his career, but lost 9–17 to eventual champion John Higgins.|$|E
5|$|Quackenbush {{became a}} fan {{favourite}} upon {{his arrival in}} Boston, where his offensive style of play was compared to former Bruin (and fellow Hall of Famer) Eddie Shore. In his first season in Boston, Quackenbush scored 8 goals and 25 points. He continued {{to stay out of}} the penalty box, registering only 4 penalty minutes. However, it marked the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> seasons that he was not named to the NHL All-Star Team. The Bruins defence core was depleted by injury in 1950–51, forcing the team to use several first year players. While this resulted in Quackenbush having to play more minutes, including a game where he played 55 minutes, it also gave him the opportunity to play with his brother Max. It was the only time the two played professionally together. He also set a career high in points with 29 and was again named a First Team NHL All-Star. Over the next five seasons Quackenbush hovered around the 20 point mark and was never assessed more than 8 penalty minutes in a year.|$|E
5|$|The sixth set of episodes also stayed {{below the}} 4 million mark, {{but in an}} evening that saw ITV beat BBC One's {{audience}} share in the evening by 19.6% to 19%, including the earlier episode of Red of Black? gaining 3.8m viewers, while the later show was viewed by slightly more with 3.9m. However, in direct competition with the later show was BBC One's Would I Lie to You? which had slightly more viewers, with 4m tuning in. On the return of Red or Black? to Saturday night, the show climbed above 4 million for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> days, to 4.63m for the first show and then up to 5.67m for the second. This enabled ITV to beat BBC One in the primetime ratings overall, by 23.3% to 21%, even though the first episode of series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing was broadcast on BBC. However Red or Black? individually placed behind both Strictly and Doctor Who, with the overnights for the BBC shows being 7.6 and 6.0 million, respectively. Overall through the week the main ITV channel had a higher share of the ratings during primetime than BBC One on five out of the seven occasions, a turnaround from the previous week where it only won on a single evening.|$|E

5|$|While {{the injury}} {{did not require}} surgery, Raymond {{retained}} the back brace for six weeks and was largely immobile for two months. In late July, he received a text message from Boychuk, explaining that his intention was not to injure with the hit. Unable to train on the ice or with weights, Raymond spent the 2011 off-season largely inactive, {{with the exception of}} cardiovascular workouts. Five-and-a-half months after sustaining his back injury, Raymond was set to return to the Canucks' lineup for a game against the Predators on December 1, 2011. However, the team failed to file the proper paperwork to the NHL by the 5 p.m. deadline, delaying Raymond's return until the following game. He recorded six points (three goals and three assists) in his first seven games back, but struggled to produce offensively {{for the remainder of the}} season. In March 2012, he was made a healthy scratch for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years.|$|E
5|$|Continental {{reformer}} Philipp Melanchthon {{was aware}} that he was very much admired by Henry. In early 1539, Melanchthon wrote several letters to Henry criticising his views on religion, in particular his support of clerical celibacy. By late April another delegation from the Lutheran princes arrived to build on Melanchthon's exhortations. Cromwell {{wrote a letter to the}} king in support of the new Lutheran mission. However, the king had begun to change his stance and concentrated on wooing conservative opinion in England rather than reaching out to the Lutherans. On 28 April 1539, Parliament met for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years. Cranmer was present, but Cromwell was unable to attend due to ill health. On 5 May the House of Lords created a committee with the customary religious balance between conservatives and reformers to examine and determine doctrine. However, the committee was given little time to do the detailed work needed for a thorough revision. On 16 May, the Duke of Norfolk noted that the committee had not agreed on anything, and proposed that the Lords examine six doctrinal questions—which eventually formed the basis of the Six Articles. They affirmed the conservative interpretation of doctrines such as the real presence, clerical celibacy, and the necessity of auricular confession, the private confession of sins to a priest. As the Act of the Six Articles neared passage in Parliament, Cranmer moved his wife and children out of England to safety. Up until this time, the family was kept quietly hidden, most likely in Ford Palace in Kent. The Act passed Parliament at the end of June and it forced Latimer and Nicholas Shaxton to resign their dioceses given their outspoken opposition to the measure.|$|E
5|$|During the close-season, Johnson {{sought a}} {{possible}} new club back in England, {{and before the}} start of the 2010 season in America, he was given a trial with Major League Soccer side Seattle Sounders FC joining them for their pre-season training camp. Having trained with Sounders, Johnson decided to stay with Austin Aztex and signed a new two-year contract. In the first game of the Aztex season, Johnson hit the goalpost with a 20-yard curling shot, but Lawrence Olum scored with the rebound, helping the Aztex to a 2–0 victory against Montreal Impact. During May, Johnson scored five goals, including two in a 3–3 draw with Tampa Bay and made two assists to help Austin record an unbeaten spell. He again scored two goals in a 2–1 Aztex victory over Miami and helped take his team to the top of the table by being the club's leading goalscorer throughout the campaign. Heath also used him in his original position in attack, including as a sole striker in a defeat to Puerto Rico Islanders. It was a result that saw the Aztex lose their top spot for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> months. A week later, Johnson scored his tenth goal of the season to give his side their fourth win in five games by defeating Carolina RailHawks 3–2. The Aztex returned to the top of the table with a 2–0 victory against NSC Minnesota Stars with Johnson scoring the opening goal of the game. Aztex qualified for the end-of-season play-offs where they faced Montreal Impact over two legs. Johnson scored one of Aztex's two goals in the second leg but their season finished with a 5–2 aggregate defeat. Johnson played a total of 28 games during the season, scoring 15 goals, and earned a place in the 2010 season best XI.|$|E

5|$|For the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> seasons, Hextall was not traded {{during the}} off-season, and {{remained}} with the Flyers for the 1995–96 season. During the regular season, Hextall improved on his {{figures from the}} previous year, passing 30wins {{for the first time}} since 1988–89. His GAA of2.17 was both the best in the NHL that year, and the best of Hextall's career. In the playoffs, Hextall played in all twelve of the Flyers' games, a 4–2 first round victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning followed by a 4–2 defeat to the Florida Panthers. His GAA of2.13 was his lowest recorded in any post-season. He continued to perform well over the next two seasons, passing 30wins again in 1996–97, and adding another nine shutouts to the four he had made in 1995–96. Over his first five seasons in the NHL, Hextall only made one shutout, while in his final six seasons, he achieved the feat on nineteen occasions. The Flyers progressed to the 1997 Stanley Cup Finals, though Hextall only appeared in eight playoff games, finishing seven of them. Throughout the season and the playoffs, the uncertainty in goal resulted in Hextall and Garth Snow swapping places regularly. Snow started nine of the ten games during the first two rounds, but Hextall replaced him in game two of the Conference Final, and remained the starting goaltender for the remainder of the series. A loss against the Detroit Red Wings in the first game of the Stanley Cup finals resulted in coach Murray switching back to Snow for the second game. Hextall returned for games three and four, but the Flyers were swept 4–0 by the Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|On March 15, 2012, the Trail Blazers {{made several}} moves, {{including}} two trades before the 3pm EST deadline. Center Marcus Camby {{was sent to}} the Houston Rockets in exchange for center Hasheem Thabeet and point guard Jonny Flynn. Portland also received Houston's second-round draft pick in the 2012 NBA draft. Portland then traded forward Gerald Wallace to the New Jersey Nets for center Mehmet Okur, forward Shawne Williams, and New Jersey's first-round, top-3-protected pick in the 2012 NBA draft. All four players acquired in the trades held expiring contracts, meaning they would be free agents {{at the end of the}} season. Oden was released from the roster after playing a total of 82 games in five NBA seasons, being cut along with Chris Johnson in order to make room for the incoming traded players. Finally, head coach Nate McMillan was also fired, leaving the franchise with the third-most coaching wins, behind Jack Ramsay and Rick Adelman. Portland named Kaleb Canales as the interim head coach for the rest of the 2011–2012 NBA season. A few days later, Portland claimed forward J. J. Hickson off waivers from the Sacramento Kings. After shaking up the roster and limping to the end of the regular season with a 28–38 record and finishing out of playoff contention for the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years, the team entered the offseason on the search for a general manager and new head coach.|$|E
5|$|On the October 10 {{episode of}} Raw, Heyman, on Lesnar's behalf, {{challenged}} Goldberg to a fight after the pair had been feuding {{for several months}} through social media and during promotional work for the WWE 2K17 video game, which featured Lesnar as the cover star and Goldberg as the pre-order bonus. Heyman stated that Goldberg was the one blemish on Lesnar's WWE career, as Goldberg had defeated Lesnar at WrestleMania XX in 2004. On the October 17 episode of Raw, Goldberg returned to the WWE after a twelve-year absence and accepted Lesnar's request for a fight with their match later scheduled for Survivor Series. On the final Raw before Survivor Series, Lesnar and Goldberg had a confrontation {{for the first time}} in twelve years, resulting in a brawl with security after Heyman insulted Goldberg's family. On November 20 at Survivor Series, Lesnar lost to Goldberg in 1 minute and 26 seconds, marking the <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>three</b> years that Lesnar was pinned. The next night on Raw, Goldberg declared himself the first entrant in the 2017 Royal Rumble match. The following week on Raw, Heyman addressed the Survivor Series match, stating that they underestimated Goldberg and that the match was a humiliation and embarrassment for him and Lesnar, who would also be in the Royal Rumble as he has something to prove. Lesnar returned on the January 16 episode of Raw to confront other Royal Rumble participants, attacking Sami Zayn, Seth Rollins, and Roman Reigns. At the Royal Rumble on January 29, Lesnar entered at number 26 and went on to eliminate Enzo Amore, Dean Ambrose and Dolph Ziggler before confronting Goldberg, who entered at number 28 and quickly eliminated Lesnar after a spear.|$|E
