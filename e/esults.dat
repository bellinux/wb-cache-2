40|$|The {{central nervous}} system (CNS) is often intimately {{involved}} in reproduction control and is therefore a target organ for transcriptomic investigations to identify reproduction-associated genes. In this study, 454 transcriptome sequencing was performed on pooled brain and ventral nerve cord of the female mud crab (Scylla olivacea) following serotonin injection (5 µg/g BW). A total of 197, 468 sequence reads was obtained with an average length of 828 bp. Approximately 38. 7 % of 2, 183 isotigs matched with significant similarity (E value < 1 e- 4) to sequences within the Genbank non-redundant (nr) database, with most significant matches being to crustacean and insect sequences. Approximately 32 putative neuropeptide genes were identified from nonmatching blast sequences. In addition, we identified full-length transcripts for crustacean reproductive-related genes, namely farnesoic acid o-methyltransferase (FAMeT), estrogen sulfotransferase (<b>ESULT)</b> and prostaglandin F synthase (PGFS). Following serotonin injection, which would normally initiate reproductive processes, we found up-regulation of FAMeT, <b>ESULT</b> and PGFS expression in the female CNS and ovary.
