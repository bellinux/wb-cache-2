5|$|A 2011 {{study of}} the nasal {{passages}} of Euoplocephalus supported their function as a <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> water balancing system, noting the extensive blood vessel system and an increased surface area for the mucosa membrane (used for <b>heat</b> <b>and</b> water exchange in modern animals). The researchers also supported the loops acting as a resonance chamber, comparable to the enlongated nasal passages of saiga antelope and looping trachea of cranes and swans. Reconstructions of the inner ear suggest adaptation to hearing at low frequencies, such as the low-toned resonant sounds possibly produced by the nasal passages. They disputed {{the possibility that the}} looping is related to olfaction (sense of smell) as the olfactionary region is pushed to the sides of the main airway.|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn energy {{balancing}} system (EBS) performs <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling by {{utilizing the}} refrigerant cycle. As it produces <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling simultaneously, EBS has an advantage when <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling demand occur simultaneously. Furthermore, with increase in a thermal storage capacity, it can conduct energy balancing by <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling which occur at different times. It {{can result in}} both {{an increase in the}} <b>heating</b> <b>and</b> cooling produced by energy balancing and a reduction in operating cost. However, it leads to increase the initial cost of the thermal storage tank. This study suggests that total cost should be considered adapting EBS...|$|R
