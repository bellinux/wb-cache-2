5|$|By {{the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth century, {{prohibition}} and women's suffrage had become the major reform issues in the state. Although supporters and their opponents closely linked the two movements, temperance received a broader hearing than the efforts toward equal suffrage. While many Protestant churches in Indiana supported temperance, few provided a forum <b>for</b> <b>discussions</b> on women's voting rights.|$|E

5|$|In 211 BC an Aetolian {{assembly}} was convened <b>for</b> <b>discussions</b> with Rome. Laevinus {{pointed out}} the recent capture of Syracuse and Capua {{in the war against}} Carthage as evidence of Rome's rising fortunes, and offered to ally with them against the Macedonians. A treaty was signed. The Aetolians would conduct operations on land, the Romans at sea. Rome would keep any slaves and other booty taken and Aetolia would receive control of any territory acquired. Another provision of the treaty allowed for the inclusion of certain allies of the League: Elis, Sparta, Messenia and Attalus I of Pergamon, as well as two Roman clients, the Illyrians Pleuratus and Scerdilaidas.|$|E

5|$|In early April, Dangić {{travelled}} to Belgrade <b>for</b> <b>discussions</b> {{with representatives}} of Nedić and Chetnik leaders. He was arrested by the German authorities and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp in occupied Poland. Dangić was replaced by Stevan Botić. On 15 April 1942 the Wehrmacht commander in south-east Europe, Generalfeldmarschall (Field Marshal) Wilhelm List, issued an order forbidding Wehrmacht units to negotiate with any rebel groups. Only Abwehr (military intelligence) and police units were to maintain surveillance of such groups through informants and undercover agents.|$|E
5|$|On 19 December, a {{delegation}} of IGH staff officers, led by IJA Colonel Joichiro Sanada, chief of the IGH's operations section, arrived at Rabaul <b>for</b> <b>discussions</b> about future plans concerning New Guinea and Guadalcanal.

Imamura also stated that any decision to withdraw should include plans to evacuate {{as many of the}} soldiers from Guadalcanal as possible.|$|E

5|$|Raoul Wallenberg's half-brother, Guy von Dardel, a {{well-known}} physicist, retired from CERN, {{was dedicated to}} finding out his half-brother's fate. He traveled to the Soviet Union about fifty times <b>for</b> <b>discussions</b> and research, including {{an examination of the}} Vladimir prison records. Over the years, Professor von Dardel compiled a 50,000-page archive of interviews, journal articles, letters, and other documents related to his quest. In 1991, Dardel initiated a Swedish-Russian working group to search eleven separate military and government archives from the former Soviet Union for information about Wallenberg's fate, but the group was not able to find conclusive information. Many, including Professor von Dardel and his daughters Louise and Marie, do not accept the various versions of Wallenberg's death. They continue to request that the archives in Russia, Sweden, and Hungary be opened to impartial researchers.|$|E
5|$|The government, {{represented}} by Lord Irwin, decided {{to negotiate with}} Gandhi. The Gandhi–Irwin Pact was signed in March 1931. The British Government agreed to free all political prisoners, {{in return for the}} suspension of the civil disobedience movement. According to the pact, Gandhi was invited to attend the Round Table Conference in London <b>for</b> <b>discussions</b> and as the sole representative of the Indian National Congress. The conference was a disappointment to Gandhi and the nationalists. Gandhi expected to discuss India's independence, while the British side focused on the Indian princes and Indian minorities rather than on a transfer of power. Lord Irwin's successor, Lord Willingdon, took a hard line against India as an independent nation, began a new campaign of controlling and subduing the nationalist movement. Gandhi was again arrested, and the government tried and failed to negate his influence by completely isolating him from his followers.|$|E
5|$|When Árbenz {{was sworn}} in as defense {{minister}} under President Arévalo, he became the first to hold the portfolio since it had previously been known as the Ministry of War. In the fall of 1947, Árbenz, as defense minister, objected to the deportation of several workers after they had been accused of being communists. Well-known communist José Manuel Fortuny was intrigued by this action and decided to visit him, and found Árbenz to be different from the stereotypical Central American military officer. That first meeting was followed by others until Árbenz invited Fortuny to his house <b>for</b> <b>discussions</b> that usually extended for hours. Like Árbenz, Fortuny was inspired by a fierce nationalism and a burning desire to improve the conditions of the Guatemalan people, and, like Árbenz, he sought answers in Marxist theory. This relationship would strongly influence Árbenz in the future.|$|E

25|$|Wages are {{negotiated}} annually or biennially for minimum wages, basic {{working conditions}} and remunerations. If there is a stalemate it goes for arbitration with the Ministry of labour.
