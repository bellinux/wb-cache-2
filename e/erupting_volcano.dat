5|$|Like other volcanoes in the Anahim Volcanic Belt, the Itcha Range is not {{monitored}} closely {{enough by}} the Geological Survey of Canada to ascertain how active its magma system is. The Canadian National Seismograph Network {{has been established}} to monitor earthquakes throughout Canada, {{but it is too}} far away to provide an accurate indication of activity under the range.

25|$|Lava {{flows in}} the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province {{are among the}} least hazardous, even though they can be {{enormously}} destructive to property in their path. This is because lava generally moves slowly enough {{for people to get}} out of their way, though this is dependent on the viscosity of the lava. Lava flows typically have secondary hazards, including the destruction of buildings and ejection of volcanic gases. Forest fires started by lava flows are also a possibility in this part of Canada. The typical lava fountains in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province are commonly associated with lava flows, but these do not normally reach heights more than a few hundred metres. Therefore, the dangers caused by lava fountains are only adjacent to the <b>erupting</b> <b>volcano.</b>|$|E

25|$|Together {{with the}} Doctor, Jamie {{encounters}} Cybermen, Daleks, the Yeti in the London Underground, the Ice Warriors, {{and many other}} dangers. Jamie is particularly fond and protective of Victoria, {{due in part to}} her being an elegant Victorian lady. For example, in The Ice Warriors Jamie's first priority is to rescue Victoria despite being injured {{to the point where he}} can't walk. Jamie is heartbroken when Victoria decides to stay with the Harris family at the end of Fury from the Deep, to the point of even being briefly angry with the Doctor for allowing her to leave (The Wheel in Space). Jamie initially finds Zoe's more modern attitudes and bossy nature irritating, but eventually adopts the same protective attitude disguised by the same bantering he engages in with the Doctor. Often Jamie's simple common sense beats Zoe's strict logic, such as in The Dominators where Jamie realises that the <b>erupting</b> <b>volcano</b> is going to threaten the TARDIS, while the Doctor and Zoe are still congratulating themselves on defeating their enemies.|$|E

The aim of {{this paper}} was to {{investigate}} the arthropod colonisation of a recently <b>erupted</b> <b>volcano</b> in the framework of a general model of colonisation kinetics. 2. We analysed the diversity of arthropod communities at three locations on Faial Island (Azores) using a well-defined disturbance gradient: (i) a site that is new land added by the eruption of Capelinhos Volcano of 1957; (ii) a site moderately affected by this eruption; and (iii) a pristine site not affected. We calculated the recolonisation times at the disturbed sites using species richness at the undisturbed site as an equilibrium value (last erupted 900 – 1000 years ago). 3. Species with different distributional ranges (endemic, native non-endemic and introduced) have different colonisation kinetics. Introduced exotic species were particularly rapid in colonising the <b>erupted</b> <b>volcano,</b> reaching a number of species greater than that observed in the undisturbed area. By contrast, native non-endemic species had more difficulty in recolonising the erupted area, and no endemic has reached it. The volcano community is dominated by a few species with high abundance and shows low richness and strong dominance in comparison with the undisturbed community. The moderately disturbed site supports a rich and well-balanced arthropod community. 4. Although the <b>erupted</b> <b>volcano</b> has species richness even slightly higher than the undisturbed site, this is a consequence of the high colonisation ability of introduced species, and its arthropod community is strongly disharmonic...|$|R

25|$|The {{circumstances}} surrounding these reports are somewhat obscure and inconsistent. Several reports of “volcanic eruptions” in the Lassen area {{had appeared in}} Northern California newspapers in the 1850s, but Harkness was probably unaware of them. In the earliest of these, published in the August 21, 1850, edition of the Daily Pacific News, a San Francisco newspaper, an unnamed observer reported seeing an <b>erupting</b> <b>volcano</b> with “burning lava still running down the sides.” In 1859, the San Francisco Times printed an article in which Wozencraft and a companion were purported to have seen, from a position somewhere west of the Lassen area, flames in the sky that they attributed to a volcanic eruption. This article was widely reprinted and popularized in other papers, but no specific date or location was given for their sighting. The Shasta Republican noted on several occasions in April 1859 (referring to Wozencraft) that the Dr.’s imagination is far more active than any volcano in our County or State. It was in Harkness’ 1875 report that the date of Wozencraft’s observation is first mentioned to be the winter of 1850–1851.|$|E
25|$|Wynn's {{first major}} casino on the Las Vegas Strip was The Mirage, {{which opened in}} November 1989. It {{was the first time}} Wynn was {{involved}} with the design and construction of a casino, and he financed the $630 million project largely with high-yield bonds issued by Michael Milken. The resort's high cost and emphasis on luxury meant that it was considered high risk at the time, though the project ended up being enormously lucrative. The hotel, with its <b>erupting</b> <b>volcano</b> and South Seas theme, ignited a $12 billion building boom on the Strip. Its construction is also considered noteworthy in that Wynn had set a new standard for Vegas resorts, and when it opened The Mirage was the first casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games. Known for its entertainment, the hotel became the main venue for the Siegfried & Roy show in 1990, and in 1993 the hotel hosted the Cirque du Soleil show Nouvelle Expérience. Afterwards Wynn decided to invite Cirque to create Mystère for the soon-to-be-built Treasure Island resort next door. After Mirage, Wynn's next project Treasure Island Hotel and Casino opened in the Mirage's old parking lot in 1993, and overall cost $450 million. Intended to be family-friendly, pools in front of the casino enacted the Battle of Buccaneer Bay with two full-sized pirate ships, while the inside featured romantic tropical theming. The establishment was the home of the first permanent Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas, and the show went on to be voted nine times as the best production show in the city by the Las Vegas Review Journal reader's poll.|$|E

30|$|Active and <b>erupting</b> <b>volcanoes</b> {{is an area}} of geosciences {{that has}} seen further {{development}} for the use of UAVs. <b>Erupting</b> <b>volcanoes</b> present numerous challenges to data collection. Sarah P. Williams wrote “In 1984, the <b>volcano</b> Mauna Loa <b>erupted</b> in Hawaii, sending ribbons of lava winding down its slopes. Geologist and former pilot David Pieri of the California Institute of Technology’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory wanted to get measurements and observation of every part of the lava flow to predict its ultimate route and length. However, he only had one way to see the lava: with a helicopter. “I remember being so frustrated because you could only see what was right in front of you,” says Pieri. “It was a 22 -km lava flow {{and by the time we}} flew to the bottom, we had no idea what was going on at the top” (Williams, 2013). This introductory comment epitomizes the difficulties of working on active volcanoes, where researchers can often be at harm’s way (e.g. the Unzen killed the Kraft husband and wife during the 1991 – 1995 eruption and 41 other TV crews and scientists).|$|R
