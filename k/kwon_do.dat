30|$|Studying dress {{specifically}} {{within a}} workplace context, in the 1990 s <b>Kwon</b> (1994) <b>did</b> not have her participants actually wear different clothing styles but {{asked them to}} project how they might think about themselves {{if they were to}} wear appropriate versus inappropriate clothing to work. Participants indicated they would feel more competent and responsible if they wore appropriate rather than inappropriate clothing. Similarly, Rafaeli et al. (1997)a found that employees indicated a link between self-perception and clothing associating psychological discomfort with wearing inappropriate dress for work and increased social self-confidence with appropriate attire. Nearly ten years later, Adomaitis and Johnson (2005) in a study of flight attendants found that the attendants linked wearing casual uniforms for work (e.g., t-shirt, shorts) with negative self-perceptions (e.g., nonauthoritative, embarrassment, unconfident, unprofessional). Likewise, Peluchette and Karl (2007) investigating the impact of formal versus casual attire in the workplace found that their participants viewed themselves as most authoritative, trustworthy, productive and competent when wearing formal business attire but as friendliest when wearing casual or business casual attire. Continuing this line of research with individuals employed in the public sector, Karl et al. (2013) reported participants indicated they felt more competent and authoritative when in formal business or business casual attire and least creative and friendly when wearing casual dress.|$|R

5000|$|Penner was a {{contestant}} on Survivor: Cook Islands in 2006. He {{was one of}} {{the original}} five members of the Rarotonga tribe (Raro). He quickly became notorious among the cast for stealing another tribe's chicken on the first day. In episode three, the four tribes evenly divided into two new mixed tribes, Aitutaki and Rarotonga. Penner found himself on Aitutaki (Aitu). While a member of Aitu, he became part of an alliance that consisted of Yul Kwon, Candice Woodcock, Becky Lee and Sundra Oakley. This alliance lasted until episode eight when the members of Aitu and Raro were offered a chance to mutiny by joining the opposing tribe. Penner, along with Woodcock, chose to leave Aitu for Raro, the only two castaways to accept the offer. After the merge, he flipped again and voted with the former Aitus. Ultimately, Kwon voted him out to appease the former Raro members, who viewed Penner as a two-faced rat for having betrayed them. He was the fourteenth person voted out, finishing in seventh place. As his torch was snuffed, he turned to the Final Six and said, [...] "And I'd like my hat back at some point", then left (<b>Kwon</b> actually <b>did</b> bring his hat back to him at the next Tribal Council). Penner humbly voted for Kwon to win in the Final Tribal Council.|$|R
500|$|Ben, {{although}} extremely well-mannered, has an impeccable {{ability to}} lie and manipulate {{the people around}} him, even when he is at a physical disadvantage. He often speaks in a low, emotionless monotone when at his most unreadable, frequently sprinkling his speech with sarcasm or dry, humorless jokes. He can also be petty and vindictive, {{even to the point}} of murder, when he does not get what he wants. He claims to have been born on the Island, leading to him being thought of as a miracle by the Others, as pregnant women die on the island; but later confesses to Locke that he was lying. He unsuccessfully tries to convince the survivors he is Henry Gale, although succeeds in manipulating Locke to turn against Jack while held prisoner under this guise. While he claims he will not sacrifice innocent lives in order to accomplish his goals, he has been shown to do quite the opposite. In the third-season finale, Ben is informed by Tom Friendly (M. C. Gainey), an Other, that they have captured three of the crash survivors: Sayid Jarrah, Bernard Nadler (Sam Anderson), and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim). When Tom tells Ben they are unwilling to reveal any information about the rest of the survivors, Ben quickly replies [...] "Shoot Kwon... You want them to answer questions, kill <b>Kwon</b> - <b>do</b> it now". Conversely, Ben refuses to allow his spy on the freighter to destroy it long before it reaches the Island, as he would not kill anyone who [...] "did not deserve to die". Furthermore, when Locke confronts Ben about causing the freighter to explode, Ben coldly replies, [...] "So?" ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This {{is a very}} {{interesting}} paper reviewing the technique for testing semiparametric hypotheses using GLR tests. I’d like to supplement Fan and Jiang’s review with some cautions and a somewhat different point of view. 1 The Wilks phenomenon Rigorous results for smooth parametric models, see, for example, Bickel and Doksum (2005, Chap. 6) do say that, if ˆθ, ˆη or, equivalently, (ˆθ ˆη, ˆη) are MLE’s, then 2 (ℓ (ˆθ, ˆη) −ℓ(θ 0, ˆηθ 0)) � ⇒ χ 2 d, where d is the dimension of Θ. Butifˆηis not the MLE this result may fail to hold. In particular it will fail if, in the case of θ,η real, E(θ 0,η 0) ∂ℓ ∂θ (X 1,θ 0,η 0) · ∂ℓ ∂η (X 1,θ 0,η 0) = 0. More generally, if θ and η are infinite dimensional, the requirement is that the tangent spaces at (θ 0,η 0) of the models with θ = θ 0 kept fixed, ◦ P, and η = η 0 kept fixed, η ◦ P, are orthogonal in L 2 (P(θ 0,η 0)) — θ seeBickeletal. (1993). All of Fan and Jiang’s examples satisfy this condition— appropriately generalized to the general dependent case—see Bickel and <b>Kwon</b> (2001). Murphy’s <b>does</b> not but the estimator (ˆθ, ˆη) that she uses is efficient, i. e., behaves like the MLE in nice parametric situations. We give a heuristic argument below why the Wilks phenomenon can only be expected if ˆη is efficient or the tangent spaces are orthogonal...|$|R

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, each taekwondo {{club and}} school is different therefore {{there is not}} single way to teach taekwondo. However, {{there are a few}} basic training techniques that can help students achieve certain skills in tae <b>kwon</b> <b>do.</b> Forms are usually practiced through repetition. Learning one half of the form and then {{moving on to the next}} half is the technique that is most often used. Then of course, even after students complete the form, it is necessary to critique them on the specifics. Students should master all of the stances in the current form before moving on to the next form. Chambering should be emphasized and it is helpful to explain why chambering is necessary and how each initial position helps execute force. For kicking, teaching snapping is extremely important for learning how to do proper kicks. Students typically line up against a wall or something they can place their hand on for balance, lift their knee up, and repeatedly practicing bending the leg in and snapping it out. This helps students gain the necessary muscles to have stronger, clean, and more accurate kicks. This general strategy can also be used for different kicks. Students can lean against the wall, lift their legs up close to their belly button and repeatedly shoot their leg out to practice side kick or they can shift the angle of their hips downwards and repeat the same thing to practice back kick. This type of practice is about building the muscle and carefully practicing the proper technique. By using targets, students can practice the accuracy of their kicks as well as transitioning from one kick to the other. You can either do target training to practice one kick over and over and carefully critique it so to get the proper technique or you can do a combination of kicks to improve balance and transitioning. It is also important to practice agility and endurance.|$|E
