5|$|Polyketides are {{synthesized}} by polymerization of acetyl and propionyl subunits by classic enzymes {{as well as}} iterative and multimodular {{enzymes that}} share mechanistic features with the fatty acid synthases. They comprise {{a large number of}} secondary metabolites and natural products from animal, plant, bacterial, fungal and marine sources, and have great structural diversity. Many polyketides are cyclic molecules whose backbones are often further modified by glycosylation, methylation, <b>hydroxylation,</b> oxidation, or other processes. Many commonly used anti-microbial, anti-parasitic, and anti-cancer agents are polyketides or polyketide derivatives, such as erythromycins, tetracyclines, avermectins, and antitumor epothilones.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme P450c21, {{commonly}} referred to as 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), is embedded in the smooth endoplasmic reticulum of the cells of the adrenal cortex. It catalyzes <b>hydroxylation</b> of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol in the glucocorticoid pathway, which starts from pregnenolone and finishes with cortisol. It also catalyzes <b>hydroxylation</b> of progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) in the mineralocorticoid pathway on its way from pregnenolone to aldosterone.|$|E
25|$|Three enzymes (prolyl-3-hydroxylase, prolyl-4-hydroxylase, and lysyl hydroxylase) {{that are}} {{required}} for the <b>hydroxylation</b> of proline and lysine in the synthesis of collagen. These reactions add hydroxyl groups to the amino acids proline or lysine in the collagen molecule via prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase, both requiring vitamin C as a cofactor. <b>Hydroxylation</b> allows the collagen molecule to assume its triple helix structure, and thus vitamin C {{is essential to the}} development and maintenance of scar tissue, blood vessels, and cartilage.|$|E
40|$|Stereospecific {{side-chain}} <b>hydroxylations</b> of 5 β-cholestane- 3 α, 7 α-diol {{were studied}} in mitochondrial and microsomal fractions of human liver. Incubation of 5 β-cholestane- 3 α, 7 α-diol resulted in <b>hydroxylations</b> at C- 12, C- 24, C- 25, and C- 26. <b>Hydroxylations</b> at C- 24 and C- 26 {{were accompanied by}} the introduction of additional asymmetric carbon atoms at C- 24 and C- 25 respectively, that {{led to the formation of}} two distinct pairs of diastereoisomers, namely 5 β-cholestane- 3 α, 7 α, 24 -triols (24 R and 24 S) and 5 β-cholestane- 3 α, 7 α, 26 -triols (25 R and 25 S). A sensitive and reproducible radioactive assay to measure the formation of the different biosynthetic 5 β-cholestanetriols was developed. Optimal assay conditions for human mitochondrial and microsomal systems were tentatively established...|$|R
50|$|It is a {{precursor}} in the biosynthesis of sinapic acid. Phenylalanine is first converted to cinnamic acid by {{the action of}} the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). A series of enzymatic <b>hydroxylations</b> and methylations leads to coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 5-hydroxyferulic acid and sinapic acid.|$|R
50|$|P450scc catalyzes the {{conversion}} of cholesterol to pregnenolone in three monooxygenase reactions. These involve 2 <b>hydroxylations</b> of the cholesterol side-chain, which generate, first, 22R-hydroxycholesterol and then 20alpha,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. The final step cleaves the bond between carbons 20 and 22, resulting {{in the production of}} pregnenolone and isocaproic aldehyde.|$|R
25|$|Mescaline is biosynthesized from {{tyrosine}} or a hydroxylated phenylalanine. In Lophophora williamsii (Peyote), dopamine converts into mescaline in a biosynthetic pathway involving m-O-methylation and aromatic <b>hydroxylation.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ascorbic acid {{is needed}} {{for a variety of}} biosynthetic pathways, by {{accelerating}} <b>hydroxylation</b> and amidation reactions. In the synthesis of collagen, ascorbic acid is required as a cofactor for prolyl hydroxylase and lysyl hydroxylase. These two enzymes are responsible for the <b>hydroxylation</b> of the proline and lysine amino acids in collagen. Hydroxyproline and hydroxylysine are important for stabilizing collagen by cross-linking the propeptides in collagen. Defective collagen fibrillogenesis impairs wound healing. Collagen {{is an important part of}} bone, so bone formation is affected. Defective connective tissue leads to fragile capillaries, resulting in abnormal bleeding. Untreated scurvy is invariably fatal.|$|E
25|$|The {{biosynthesis}} of menthol {{has been}} investigated in M. x piperita and the enzymes involved in have been identified and characterized. It begins with the synthesis of the terpene limonene, followed by <b>hydroxylation,</b> and then several reduction and isomerization steps.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mushroom}} Agrocybe aegerita secretes a peroxidase (AaP) that catalyzes halogenations and <b>hydroxylations.</b> Phenol was brominated to 2 - and 4 -bromophenol (ratio 1 : 4) and chlorinated to {{a lesser}} extent to 2 -chlorophenol. The purified enzyme was found to oxidize toluene via benzyl alcohol and benzaldehyde into benzoic acid. A second fraction of toluene was hydroxylated to give p-cresol as well as o-cresol and methyl-p-benzoquinone. The UV–Vis absorption spectrum of purified AaP showed high similarity to a resting state cytochrome P 450 with the Soret band at 420 nm and additional maxima at 278, 358, 541 and 571 nm; the AaP CO-complex had a distinct absorption maximum at 445 nm that is characteristic for heme-thiolate proteins. AaP regioselectively hydroxylated naphthalene to 1 -naphthol and traces of 2 -naphthol (ratio 36 : 1). H 2 O 2 was necessarily required for AaP function and hence the <b>hydroxylations</b> catalyzed by AaP can be designated as peroxygenation and the enzyme as an extracellular peroxygenase...|$|R

It also inhibits its own metabolism.|$|E
5000|$|The {{selectivity}} of some <b>hydroxylations</b> may be drastically {{improved in}} some cases {{with the addition of}} coordinating groups alpha to the oxaziridine ring as oxaziridines 3b and 3c in the table above. [...] In these instances it is proposed that the reaction proceeds through a closed transition state where the metal oxyanion is stabilized by chelation from the sulfate and coordinating groups on the camphor skeleton.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there may}} not be a precise elucidation of Pancratistatin {{biological}} synthesis, there have been speculations on biosynthesis of Narciclasine and Lycoricidine that are very similar to Pancratistatin in terms of structure. The biosynthesis is accomplished via synthesis from O-methylnorbelladine 4 by para-para phenol coupling to obtain vittatine 5 as an intermediate. Subsequent elimination of two carbon atoms and <b>hydroxylations</b> of compound 5 (vittatine) then leads to narciclasine.|$|R
40|$|A natural {{bacterial}} strain, {{identified as}} Pseudomonas fluorescens DB- 5, was isolated in enrichment cultures containing 1, 2 -diphenylethanone {{as the only}} source of carbon and energy. On the basis of characteristic features observed in the mass spectra of degradation intermediates, it is proposed that metabolism of 1, 2 -diphenylethanone is initiated by two <b>hydroxylations</b> on the benzyl ring. Phenol, presumably arising from the benzoyl ring, was transiently detected as a catabolic intermediate...|$|R
25|$|Estradiol is also metabolized via <b>hydroxylation</b> into {{catechol}} estrogens. In the liver, it is non-specifically metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP3A4, and CYP2C9 via 2-hydroxylation into 2-hydroxyestradiol, and by CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2C8 via 17β-hydroxy dehydrogenation into estrone, {{with various}} other cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes and metabolic transformations also being involved.|$|E
25|$|Estrogens are metabolized via <b>hydroxylation</b> by {{cytochrome}} P450 enzymes such as CYP1A1 and CYP3A4 and via conjugation by estrogen sulfotransferases (sulfation) and UDP-glucuronyltransferases (glucuronidation).

25|$|The oral {{bioavailability}} of mirtazapine {{is about}} 50%. It is found mostly bound to plasma proteins, about 85%. It is metabolized {{primarily in the}} liver by demethylation and <b>hydroxylation</b> via cytochrome P450 enzymes. One of its major metabolites is desmethylmirtazapine. The overall elimination half-life is 20–40 hours. About 75% is eliminated in feces and 25% in urine.|$|E
50|$|Aromatase is {{localized}} in the {{endoplasmic reticulum}} {{where it is}} regulated by tissue-specific promoters that are in turn controlled by hormones, cytokines, and other factors. It catalyzes the last steps of estrogen biosynthesis from androgens (specifically, it transforms androstenedione to estrone and testosterone to estradiol). These steps include three successive <b>hydroxylations</b> of the 19-methyl group of androgens, followed by simultaneous elimination of the methyl group as formate and aromatization of the A-ring.|$|R
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases are of {{outstanding}} {{interest for the}} synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals, due {{to their ability to}} hydroxylate C [...] H bonds mainly in a stereo- and regioselective manner. CYP 106 A 2 from Bacillus megaterium ATCC 13368, one of only a few known bacterial steroid hydroxylases, enables the oxidation of 3 -keto- 4 -ene steroids mainly at position 15. We expressed this enzyme together with the electron-transfer partners bovine adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase in Escherichia coli. Additionally an enzyme-coupled cofactor regeneration system was implemented by expressing alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis. By studying the conversion of progesterone and testosterone, the bottlenecks of these P 450 -catalyzed <b>hydroxylations</b> were identified. Substrate transport into the cell and substrate solubility turned out to be crucial for the overall performance. Based on these investigations we developed a new concept for CYP 106 A 2 -catalyzed steroid <b>hydroxylations</b> by which the productivity of progesterone and testosterone conversion could be increased up to 18 -fold to yield an absolute productivity up to 5. 5 g L(- 1) d(- 1).

25|$|NET is {{partially}} metabolized via <b>hydroxylation</b> by CYP3A4, and inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can significantly alter circulating levels of NET.

25|$|Cytochrome P450 BM3 (CYP102A1) {{from the}} soil {{bacterium}} Bacillus megaterium catalyzes the NADPH-dependent <b>hydroxylation</b> of several long-chain fatty acids at the ω–1 through ω–3 positions. Unlike almost every other known CYP (except CYP505A1, cytochrome P450 foxy), it constitutes a natural fusion protein between the CYP domain and an electron donating cofactor. Thus, BM3 is potentially very useful in biotechnological applications.|$|E
25|$|Imino acids {{typically}} {{contain an}} imine functional group, {{instead of the}} amino group found in amino acids. Proline is considered and usually referred to as an amino acid, but unlike others, it has a secondary amine. This feature, unique to proline, identifies proline also as an imino acid. Hydroxyproline is another imino acid, made from the naturally occurring <b>hydroxylation</b> of proline.|$|E
50|$|Phenylalanine {{is first}} {{converted}} to cinnamic acid by {{the action of}} the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL). Some plants, mainly monocotyledonous, use tyrosine to synthesize p-coumaric acid {{by the action of}} the bifunctional enzyme Phenylalanine/tyrosine ammonia-lyase (PTAL). A series of enzymatic <b>hydroxylations</b> and methylations leads to coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, 5-hydroxyferulic acid, and sinapic acid. Conversion of these acids to their corresponding esters produces some of the volatile components of herb and flower fragrances, which serve many functions such as attracting pollinators. Ethyl cinnamate is a common example.|$|R
50|$|Amatoxins and phallotoxins are 8- and 7-membered natural products, respectively, {{characterized}} by N-to-C cyclization {{in addition to}} a tryptathionine motif derived from the crosslinking of Cys and Trp. Interestingly, the amatoxins and phallotoxins also differ from other RiPPs based on the presence of a C-terminal recognition sequence in addition to the N-terminal leader peptide. α-Amanitin, an amatoxin, has a number of posttranslational modifications in addition to macrocyclization and formation of the tryptathionine bridge: oxidation of the tryptathionine leads to the presence of a sulfoxide, and numerous <b>hydroxylations</b> decorate the natural product. As an amatoxin, α-amanitin is an inhibitor of RNA polymerase II.|$|R

25|$|Hormonal {{mechanisms}} {{could explain}} the increased incidence of SLE in females. The onset of SLE {{could be attributed to}} the elevated <b>hydroxylation</b> of estrogen and the abnormally decreased levels of androgens in females. In addition, differences in GnRH signalling have also shown to contribute to the onset of SLE. While females are more likely to relapse than males, the intensity of these relapses is the same for both sexes.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} II holoenzyme stability {{determines the}} number of base pairs that can be transcribed before the holoenzyme loses its ability to transcribe. The length of the CTD is essential for RNA polymerase II stability. RNA polymerase II stability {{has been shown to}} be regulated by post-translation proline <b>hydroxylation.</b> The von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL, human GeneID: 7428) complex binds the hyperphosphorylated large subunit of the RNA polymerase II complex, in a proline hydroxylation- and CTD phosphorylation-dependent manner, targeting it for ubiquitination.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{biosynthesis}} of melatonin occurs through <b>hydroxylation,</b> decarboxylation, acetylation and a methylation {{starting with}} L-tryptophan. L-tryptophan {{is produced in}} the shikimate pathway from chorismate or is acquired from protein catabolism. First L-tryptophan is hydroxylated on the indole ring by tryptophan hydroxylase to produce 5-hydroxytryptophan. This intermediate (5-HTP) is decarboxylated by pyridoxal phosphate and 5-hydroxytryptophan decarboxylase to produce serotonin. Serotonin is itself an important neurotransmitter, but is also converted into N-acetylserotonin by serotonin N-acetyltransferase and acetyl-CoA. Hydroxyindole O-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl methionine convert N-acetylserotonin into melatonin through methylation of the hydroxyl group.|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P 450 monooxygenases {{are useful}} {{biocatalysts}} for C–H activation, {{and there is}} a need to expand the range of these enzymes beyond what is naturally available. A panel of 93 variants of active self-sufficient P 450 cam[Tyr 96 Phe]-RhFRed fusion enzymes with a broad diversity in active site amino acids was developed by screening a large mutant library of 16, 500 clones using a simple, highly sensitive colony-based colorimetric screen against indole.
