60|$|At least, {{ever since}} he had learned that secret from his poor patron on his <b>dying</b> <b>bed,</b> {{actually}} as he was standing beside it, he had felt an independency which he had never known before, and which since did not desert him. So he called his old aunt Marchioness, but with an air {{as if he was}} the Marquis of Esmond who so addressed her.|$|R

50|$|During the battle, the two kings {{mortally wounded}} each other, and were carried away. Each on his <b>dying</b> <b>bed</b> called {{his son and}} had him vow to avenge him, even if each son had been opposed {{to the war in}} the first place. Bound by their pledge, the sons {{prepared}} and led a second war even though they held no grudge against each other. History repeated, and each son inflicted a fatal wound on the other.|$|R
60|$|He {{knew the}} thief, the {{grandchild}} {{of an old}} bedridden dame who lived some miles away {{on the edge of}} the moor. The old man stood long, watching the small cloaked figure till it was lost in the darkness. It was not till he lay upon his <b>dying</b> <b>bed</b> that he confessed it. But each evening, from that day, he would steal into the room and see to it himself that the window was left ajar.|$|R
6000|$|There {{were reports}} around the country, {{soon after that}} he was sick and dying. Excess had brought on that frightful disease that seems to throw the lurid shadows of a coming {{retribution}} back into the present life. None could bear the horrors of that sick room, when he raved and screamed, and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those who heard him; and, at his <b>dying</b> <b>bed,</b> stood a stern, white, inexorable figure, saying, [...] "Come! come! come!" ...|$|R

Do you know that not a priest in Prague would give her {{absolution}} though she were on her <b>dying</b> <b>bed?</b> Oh, holy Mary, it's {{a terrible thing to}} think of! It's bad enough for the old man and her to be there day after day without a morsel to eat; and I suppose {{if it were not for}} Anton Trendellsohn it would be bad enough with them--" ...|$|R

50|$|Jane {{receives}} a visitor from the past. Bessie informs {{her of her}} aunt’s illness and the request to see Jane before she dies. Jane asks Mrs. Reed why she always hated her niece. Mrs. Reed replies {{that it was because}} her husband had loved Jane more than his own children, even calling out for her on his deathbed. Jane also learns from her aunt that she has an uncle. This uncle requested to take care of Jane when she was still a child. Her aunt misinformed the uncle and told him that Jane died. Unlike her aunt, Jane is able to forgive Mrs. Reed on her aunt’s <b>dying</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The first extra chapter {{attached}} in the Laghu-Sannyasa text is ritual-focussed {{in contrast}} to the rest. Its opening sentence, states Patrick Olivelle, does not explicitly state that it is meant for a Brahmin but the style makes it clear that the ritual specified is addressed to a Brahmin on a <b>dying</b> <b>bed,</b> but who has recovered his health. The verses in this extra chapter ask this person, if he resolves to renounce, to first declare his intention to renounce to his friends and family, offer oblations to his ancestors, libation on the morning after new moon, then recite hymns from the Vedas, such as verses from section 4.1.1 of Atharvaveda: ...|$|R
6000|$|Nineteen years after, {{when the}} great conqueror lay, tossing with agony and remorse, upon his <b>dying</b> <b>bed,</b> haunted by the ghosts of his victims, the clerks of St. Saviour's in Bruges city were putting up a leaden tablet (which remains, they say, unto this very day) {{to the memory of}} one whose gentle soul had gently passed away. [...] "Charitable to the poor, kind and {{agreeable}} to her attendants, courteous to strangers, and only severe to herself," [...] Gunhilda had lingered on in a world of war and crime; and had gone, it may be, to meet Torfrida beyond the grave, and there finish their doubtful argument.|$|R
60|$|Such was {{the last}} sally of his {{sanguine}} and unconquerable spirit; which, disregarding age and infirmities, and all past sorrows and disappointments, spoke from his <b>dying</b> <b>bed</b> with all the confidence of youthful hope; and talked of still greater enterprises, {{as if he had}} a long and vigorous life before him. The Adelantado took leave of his brother, whom he was never to behold again, and set out on his mission to the new sovereigns. He experienced the most gracious reception. The claims of the admiral were treated with great attention by the young king and queen, and flattering hopes were given of a speedy and prosperous termination to his suit.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is not {{satisfactory}} at all," [...] said Clara, putting down the letter, and resolving that Will Belton should be instructed {{to repay the}} money instantly. It may, however, be explained here that in this matter Clara was doomed to be disappointed; {{and that she was}} forced, by Mr. Green's arguments, to receive the money. [...] "Then it shall go to the hospital at Perivale," [...] she declared when those arguments were used. As to that, Mr. Green was quite indifferent, but I do not think that the legacy which troubled poor Aunt Winterfield so much on her <b>dying</b> <b>bed</b> was ultimately applied to so worthy a purpose.|$|R

"They {{are fast}} rising at least," [...] said Ulrica, with frightful composure; [...] "and a signal shall soon wave {{to warn the}} besiegers to press hard upon those who would {{extinguish}} them.--Farewell, Front-de-Boeuf!--May Mista, Skogula, and Zernebock, gods of the ancient Saxons--fiends, as the priests now call them--supply the place of comforters at your <b>dying</b> <b>bed,</b> which Ulrica now relinquishes!--But know, if it will give thee comfort to know it, that Ulrica is bound to the same dark coast with thyself, the companion of thy punishment as the companion of thy guilt.--And now, parricide, farewell for ever!--May each stone of this vaulted roof find a tongue to echo that title into thine ear!" ...|$|R

6000|$|Paul {{could not}} stand that last threat. Though he had lost faith in the Apostle as an Apostle, he could never forget the {{allegiance}} he had once borne him as a father, or the spell which his powerful individuality had once thrown around him as a teacher. To have embittered that man's <b>dying</b> <b>bed</b> with {{the shadow of a}} terrible disappointment would be to Paul a lifelong subject of deep remorse. [...] "I did not intend to open my mouth in answer to you, Mr. Grimshaw," [...] he said (for the first time breaking through the customary address of Brother), [...] "but I pray you, I entreat you, I beseech you, not to harass the Apostle in his last moments with such a subject." ...|$|R
