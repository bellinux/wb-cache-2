40|$|AbstractSensory eye {{dominance}} (SED) {{reflects an}} imbalance of interocular inhibition in the binocular network. Extending an earlier work (Ooi & He, 2001) that measured global SED within the central 6 °, {{the current study}} measured SED locally at 17 locations within the central 8 ° of the binocular visual field. The eccentricities (radius) chosen for this, “binocular perimetry”, study were 0 ° (fovea), 2 ° and 4 °. At each eccentricity, eight concentric locations (polar angle: 0 °, 45 °, 90 °, 135 °, 180 °, 225 °, 270 °, and 315 °) were tested. The outcome, an SED map, sets up comparison between local SED and other visual functions [monocular contrast threshold, binocular disparity threshold, reaction time to detect depth, the dynamics of binocular rivalry and motor eye dominance]. Our analysis shows that an observer’s SED varies gradually across the binocular visual field both in its sign and magnitude. The strong <b>eye</b> <b>channel</b> revealed in the SED measurement does not always have a lower monocular contrast threshold, and {{does not need to}} be the motor dominant eye. There exists significant correlation between SED and binocular disparity threshold, and between SED and the response time to detect depth of a random-dot stereogram. A significant correlation is also found between SED and the eye that predominates when viewing an extended duration binocular rivalry stimulus. While it is difficult to attribute casual factors based on correlation analyses, these observations agree with the notion that an imbalance of interocular inhibition, which is largely revealed as SED, is a significant factor impeding binocular visual perception...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{solid-state}} dynamic parallax barrier autostereoscopic display mitigates some of {{the restrictions}} present in static barrier systems such as fixed view-distance range, slow response to head movements, and fixed stereo operating mode. By dynamically varying barrier parameters in real time, viewersmaymove closer to the display andmove faster laterally than with a static barrier system, and the display can switch between 3 D and 2 D modes by disabling the barrier on a per-pixel basis. Moreover, Dynallax can output four independent <b>eye</b> <b>channels</b> when two viewers are present, and both head-tracked viewers receive an independent pair of left-eye and right-eye perspective views based on their position in 3 D space. The display device is constructed by using a dual-stacked LCDmonitor where a dynamic barrier is rendered on the front display and a modulated virtual environment composed of two or four channels is rendered on the rear display. Dynallax was recently demonstrated in a small-scale head-tracked prototype system. This paper summarizes the concepts presented earlier, extends the discussion of various topics, and presents recent improvements to the system.

40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} and exploratory study designed {{to investigate the}} use of electrophysiologic recordings of cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) as an objective test measure for patients who have a cochlear implant (CI), with a more specific goal of learning best practices for extracting the CI artifact from the collected data. The particular evoked potential of interest was the P 1 -N 1 -P 2 complex. It was hypothesized that normal latencies and peak amplitudes of the late-evoked potential (P 1 -N 1 -P 2) would reveal characteristics that may correlate with behavioral data to indicate the level of benefit with a cochlear implant. The study included three participants, each with one cochlear implant on the right side: two males, age 13, and one female, age 10. The study also evaluated electrophysiologic data from two normal-hearing volunteers, age 21. Data was collected via a 64 -channel electrode cap with two reference electrodes placed on the mastoid and two additional upper and lower vertical <b>eye</b> <b>channels.</b> The stimulus was created using the guidelines by Dimitrijevic et al.

40|$|A novel {{barrier strip}} autostereoscopic (AS) display is {{demonstrated}} using a solid-state dynamic parallax barrier. A dynamic barrier mitigates restrictions inherent in static barrier {{systems such as}} fixed view distance range, slow response to head movements, and fixed stereo operating mode. By dynamically varying barrier parameters in real time, viewers may move closer to the display and move faster laterally than with a static barrier system. Furthermore, users can switch between 3 D and 2 D modes by disabling the barrier. Dynallax is head-tracked, directing view channels to positions in space reported by a tracking system in real time. Such head-tracked parallax barrier systems have traditionally supported only a single viewer, but by varying the barrier period to eliminate conflicts between viewers, Dynallax presents four independent <b>eye</b> <b>channels</b> when two viewers are present. Each viewer receives an independent pair of left and right eye perspective views based on their position in 3 D space. The display device is constructed using a dual-stacked LCD monitor where a dynamic barrier is rendered on the front display and the rear display produces a modulated VR scene composed of two or four channels. A small-scale head-tracked prototype VR system is demonstrated. Performance data are analyzed while advantages, disadvantages, ongoing and future work are identified...|$|R

40|$|In {{binocular}} rivalry, {{the conscious}} percept alternates stochastically between two images {{shown to the}} two eyes. Both suppressed and dominant images form afterimages (AIs) whose strength depends on the perceptual state during induction. Counterintuitively, when these two AIs rival, the AI of the previously suppressed percept gains initial dominance, {{even when it is}} weaker. Here, we examined rivalry between afterimages, between real images, and between both to examine eye-based and binocular contributions to this effect. In all experiments, we found that for both AIs and real images, the suppressed percept consistently gained initial dominance following a long suppression period. Dominance reversals failed to occur following short suppression periods and depended on an abrupt change (removal) of the stimulus. With real images, results were replicated also when <b>eye</b> <b>channels</b> were exchanged during the abrupt change. The initial dominance of the weaker, previously suppressed percept is thus not due to its weaker contrast, to it being an afterimage, or to monocular adaptation effects as previously suggested. Instead, it is due to binocular, higher level effects that favor a perceptual switch after prolonged dominance. We discuss a plausible neural account for these findings in terms of neural interactions between binocular and eye-related stages...|$|R

40|$|An {{analogy is}} drawn between the perceptual {{limitation}} {{that characterizes the}} dichotic listening paradigm and the ‘suppression’ that occurs in binocular rivalry when different stimuli are presented to the two eyes. An experiment is reported which focuses {{on the fate of}} the information residing in a suppressed <b>eye</b> (unattended <b>channel)</b> during binocular rivalry. It is demonstrated that the temporal course of rivalry is sensitive to the presence of a subliminal moving stimulus within the currently suppressed field. The effects are seen to confirm a literal interpretation of Levelt's (1966) thesis which relates changes in the ‘stimulus strength’ of a rivalling field to subsequent changes in the temporal course of the phenomenon. This interpretation is consistent with the hypothesis that, despite phenomenal suppression, a full analysis is undertaken on the currently non-dominant stimulus. The data are related to models of selective attention, and to the notion that there are parallel visual systems...|$|R
