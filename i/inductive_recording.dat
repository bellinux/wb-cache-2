40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{results from}} {{an investigation of}} a variety of thin films with particular emphasis on their suitability for use as magnetic pole materials in <b>inductive</b> <b>recording</b> heads. Initially, the magnetic and structural properties of FeTaN and FeTiN were studied, and {{it was found that the}} transition metal elements were incorporated substitutionally into the bcc #alpha#-Fe crystal structure leading to an expanded lattice constant. Nitrogen was incorporated interstitially into the crystal structure in such a way that the average grain size was reduced to a value less than the ferromagnetic exchange length, thus making the alloy magnetically soft. Other previously unreported alloys were fabricated in a similar way, namely FeWN, FeCoN and FeCoTaN and it was noted that the addition of Co increased the saturation magnetisation of the alloy to around 20 kG but also increased the coercivity. In addition to these nano-crystalline alloys it was found that adding Ta to FeCo beyond around 17 at. % effected a crystalline to amorphous phase change but the alloy retained a saturation magnetisation that was directly related to the Co content. This new alloy, FeCoTa, has not been reported previously. It was found that by depositing these alloys in a magnetic field, anisotropy could be induced in all of them. The nitrided alloys had an anisotropy due to their interstitial nitrogen and the anisotropy of FeCoTa was directly linked to the Co content. After annealing it was found that several of the alloys were thermally unstable. FeTiN and FeCoN were both severely damaged by annealing at 150 deg. C for short periods of time. FeTaN, FeWN and FeCoTaN improved with magnetic annealing up to around 200 deg. C and FeCoTa was thermally stable up to around 250 deg. C. It was found that FeCoTa was twice as resistant to cross-annealing than the nitrided alloys. The best magnetic properties (4 #pi#M_s #approx# 20 kG, H_c#approx# 3 Oe, #rho##approx# 130 #mu##OMEGA#-cm, H_k#approx# 15 - 20 Oe were seen in the amorphous FeCoTa alloy and the author recommends that this alloy be further investigated for use as pole material in the next generation high data rate inductive writer.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the potential of thoracocardiography to estimate stroke volumes while apnea with open glottis.

40|$|The ideal {{magnetic}} switching {{mechanism for}} magnetic recording is isolated domain coherent rotation. However, in typical Pd/Co and Pt/Co multilayers with high coercivity, the dominant switching mechanism is domain wall motion, which causes {{noise in the}} readback signal. Wall motion, however requires exchange coupling between grains. Oxidation and carbon incorporation into Pd/Co multilayers have been investigated as ways of reducing the exchange coupling among adjacent grains. This reduction of magnetic coupling reduces the length scale over which incoherent switching occurs. Kelly-Hankel plots and switching radius ratio {{have been used to}} compare interactions and domain sizes of oxidized and carbon segregated Pd/Co multilayers. Both oxidation and carbon segregation reduce the coupling between domains, but the multilayers nevertheless remain more strongly coupled than perpendicular alloy films. A Pt/CoCrTa multilayer structure has been invented which display little intergranular exchange coupling and nearly 100 % remanence in the perpendicular direction. Magnetic recordings of continuous square wave patterns have been made and characterized using an <b>inductive</b> contact <b>recording</b> transducer and by magnetic force microscopy. Written transitions appear to retain good fidelity at more than 300, 000 transitions per inch. With exchange isolation of the grains, media noise becomes negligible relative to thermal noise from the recording system electronics. Analysis of magnetic force microscopy images yields a signal to integrated noise ratio of 17 dB at 309, 000 transitions per inch written in a four micron wide track, which is comparable to a measured signal to noise ratio of 8 dB at 350, 000 reversals per inch measured using an inductive transducer at 100 inches/sec. These results are contrasted with observations on exchange coupled Pt/Co multilayers...|$|R
40|$|WOS: 000373622900014 International audienceThe {{radiation}} of a pure CO 2 <b>inductive</b> plasma was <b>recorded</b> between 190 and 920 nm {{during its}} interaction with a SiC sample under a pressure equal to 6 kPa {{and an estimated}} global specific enthalpy close to 12 MJ kg(- 1). The plasma electronic excitation {{was found to be}} out of equilibrium. The main radiators were found to be O, C, C- 2 and, mainly, CO. The radiation is especially significant where the plasma chemically interacts with the material revealing a stronger electronic excitation close to the surface. Excitation temperatures were also found to increase in the chemical boundary layer, which is four times smaller than the thermal boundary layer. This raises questions about the energy exchange processes of the excited states and about chemical behaviour independent of their respective ground states. The surface is found to be covered by an inhomogeneous silica layer revealing a passive oxidation, but also by bubble structures, indicative of the transition towards active oxidation. The surface temperature is estimated to be 1800 - 1900 K. Raman spectroscopy measurements on the surface and optical spectroscopy measurements in the boundary layer provide proof of carbon production coming from the SiC...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was testing the effect of {{different}} type of fibre reinforcements to the compressive ductility of lightweight aggregate concrete (LWAC). Concrete with density of about 1800 kg/m 3 and compressive strength of about 40 MPa was used. The fibres used were two types of steel fibres with lengths of 35 and 60 mm and then basalt fibres with length of 45 mm. Eight full scale over-reinforced LWAC beams with length of 4, 2 m and cross-section of 0, 2 x 0, 3 m were constructed with identical structural steel reinforcement but with different type of fibres added. The beams were then tested in a four point bending until failure. The deflection and top and bottom concrete strains were measured with <b>inductive</b> sensors and <b>recorded</b> in a test-log. Test results of these beams were compared to calculations with input values from testing of the compressive strength and oven-dry density from testing of concrete cylinders. Comparison of test results and calculations showed a generally good compliance. The fibres had {{positive effect on the}} ductility in compression. Even though they didn?t increase the load bearing capacity post-failure, they decreased the deflection rate considerably. This test indicated clear difference in effect of the steel fibres versus the basalt fibres to the compressive ductility. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a feasibility study concerning the application of STAR-methodology-basedmachine learning to construction accidents and their prevention. A ten-stage knowledge acquisition process is presented and its individual stages described. Knowledge about construction accidents was acquired using a collection of 225 examples, based on actual accidents <b>records.</b> <b>Inductive</b> learning with a system based on the STAR-methodology was employed. This system was used in both the generalization and specialization modes of operation. The decision rules obtained are complex, but their interpretation is clear and they seem to be consistent with the present understanding of causal relationships between accident results and various factors affecting them. Also, the rules were verified using average overall and omission empirical error rates, which were calculated as average for three randomly determined sequences of examples. These error rates were calculated for all seven steps in the machine learning process, and were used to construct learning curves for both error rates. The relationships between error rates and the number of examples used for learning are analyzed, and coefficients of linear regression given and discussed. The 225 examples used were found to be grossly insufficient to produce reliable knowledge about accidents and therefore a large study is postulated which would involve the collection of a larger number of construction accident records. In general, our study demonstrated the feasibility of machine learning in acquiring knowledge about construction accidents...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} the perspectives {{and practices of}} Educational Psychologists (EPs) who had encountered the apparent overlapping phenomenology of autism spectrum disorders and the enduring effects of early attachment experiences in their casework. Six EPs from two EP Services took part in interviews, which were audio <b>recorded.</b> <b>Inductive</b> and deductive analyses were mediated through the active constructionist role of the interviewer during the interview process and the thematic analysis of the resultant interview transcripts. The study intended to explore EPs’ differential conceptualisations of autism and attachment and how they conceptualise and attempt to differentiate the overlapping phenomenology. Analysis identified two other dimensions, which complemented the planned foci in a cogent way and were also examined: how EPs conceptualised the value of differentiating between autism {{and the effects of}} early attachment experiences; and how the discipline of educational psychology offers a distinct contribution to problem analysis in this area. The talk of EPs captured in this study contributes to existing practice-based evidence about overlapping phenomenology, and by describing a process of psychological problem analysis which could support more reliable differentiation between autism and effects of early attachment experiences. A distinctive contribution of the discipline of educational psychology is proposed and suggested as worthy of closer consideration as ethics and efficiencies are both of legitimate concern in contemporary multi-disciplinary, public service contexts. Other implications identified from this study pertain {{to the way in which}} EPs articulate their relationship with theory, their use of practice frameworks, and the distinct nature of their identities...|$|R
