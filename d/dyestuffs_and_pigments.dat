These criteria include also the analytical determination of harmful chemicals which may not surpass certain concentration thresholds in the specific fabric. Some of the substances which Oeko-tex monitor are SVHCs, such as <b>dyestuffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments</b> classified as allergenic, carcinogenic, or banned for other reasons (two azodyes are SVHCs), extractable heavy metals (various lead and cadmium compounds are SVHCs), flame retardant substances (such as HBCDD), organic tin compounds (such as TBTO), perfluorinated compounds, phthalates (such as DEHP, DBP, BBP), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) (such as anthracene), nonylphenol, OP, OPEO, and NPEO (which are also SVHCs). These criteria indicate which SVHCs might be present in textiles above or below the 0.1 % trigger value.|$|E

40|$|The {{elimination}} of organic pollutants from wastewater {{is an important}} procedure in environmental protection. <b>Dyestuffs</b> <b>and</b> other commercial <b>pigments</b> have emerged as a focus of environmental recovery efforts. Various chemical and physical processes, such as chemical precipitation and separation of pollutants, coagulation, and elimination by adsorption on activated carbon are applied for {{elimination of}} organic pollutants. The main disadvantage of these methods is that they only change the contamination from one phase to another. In recent years, semiconductorassisted photocatalysis and sonocatalysis has been extensively investigated, primarily due to its capability to degrade {{a great number of}} chemicals in gaseous or aqueous systems, through relatively in-expensive procedures. In this work we have investigated heterogenic photocatalytic and sonocatalytic degradation of methylen blue (MB) aqueous solution, as a common organic pollutant, in the presence of nanosized ZnO powder as a catalyst. The phase composition of synthesized ZnO nanopowder was identified by XRD, particles morphology was characterized by FE–SEM. The optical properties of ZnO nanocrystals were investigated by ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (DRS). Concentration of the MB dye in the water solution containing ZnO nanoparticles before and after photocatalytic or sonocatalytic degradation was calculated according to the absorbance maxima value at 665 nm characteristic for MB. The experiments were performed on a UV–Vis spectrophotometer in the wavelength range of 300 – 800 nm...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} design research undertaken {{into the}} correlation between natural dyes (plant extractions) and the alternative photographic process of Anthotypes discovered in the early 19 th Century. The paper explores the relationship between natural extracts (dyes) with their fastness properties {{in relation to the}} success of this photographic process and the potential this form of imaging has as a sustainable/health giving form of surface decoration for textiles: A form of Eco-patterning that relies upon light and natural substances/dyes not synthetic dyes as the colouring medium. Instigated by the output of collaborative research between two different disciplines: That of textile design and early colouration methods with historical photographic imaging techniques. The research project considered the symbiotic relationship between natural plant extracts with the success of Anthotypes. The aim of which was to consider the question: Could this kind of photographic image making be applied as a future, sustainable method of design generation, colouration and patterning of fabric for fashion and interiors? The objective was in creating an alternative sustainable surface design process that relies upon light and natural substances/dyes not chemical <b>dyestuffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments</b> as the main patterning and processing medium. The outcomes of which could also provide medicinal healing qualities by wearing clothing or sleeping on material that has been coloured with natural plant extracts (dyes), an added health bonus...|$|E
40|$|Reuse and {{recycling}} of products are key {{elements in a}} circular economy. This exploratory RIVM study shows that {{a great number of}} waste streams may contain various substances of very high concern (ZZS), which may hamper safe recycling options in the Netherlands. RIVM recommends an adequate risk management of ZZS in a circular economy. The Dutch government takes priority action on ZZS substances as they are hazardous to people and the environment. Examples include substances that are carcinogenic, impede reproduction, or bioaccumulate in food chains. ZZS may be present in waste streams as they are intentionally used in the original processes or products, or they can be contaminants. The Dutch governmental program 'The Netherlands circular in 2050 ' appoints five priority chains and sectors in the transition towards a circular economy: biomass and food, plastics, production/manufacturing, construction, and consumer products. RIVM investigated to what extent dominant waste streams in these chains and sectors contain ZZS. It is difficult to get a complete overview of ZZS in waste streams, because information is often lacking on the actual ZZS concentrations in waste. This exploratory study, however, clearly demonstrates that various ZZS can be present in each of the investigated waste streams. Examples are flame-retardants in plastics, <b>dyestuffs</b> <b>and</b> <b>pigments</b> in textile, and heavy metals in agricultural waste streams. RIVM makes recommendations with respect to prioritization of ZZS and waste streams. In addition, it is advised to develop a decision scheme to select the most appropriate waste treatment options. The results of this study are useful for the implementation of the National Waste Management Plan (LAP) that is focusing on risk control. At medium and long term the drive should be to develop safer alternatives for ZZS resulting in safe loops, irrespective of the types of end-use...|$|E
