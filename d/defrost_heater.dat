50|$|The defrost {{mechanism}} in a refrigerator heats the cooling element (evaporator coil) {{for a short}} period of time and melts the frost that has formed on it. The resulting water drains through a duct at the back of the unit. Defrosting is controlled by an electric or electronic timer: For every 6, 8, 10, 12 or 24 hours of compressor operation it turns on a <b>defrost</b> <b>heater</b> for 15 minutes to half an hour. The <b>defrost</b> <b>heater,</b> having a typical power rating of 350 W to 600 W, is mounted just below the evaporator in top- and bottom-freezer models and below and sometimes also in the middle of the evaporator in side-by-side models. It may be protected from short circuits by means of fusible links. In older refrigerators the timer ran continuously. In newer designs the timer only runs while the compressor runs, so the more the refrigerator door is closed, the less the heater will be on and the more energy will be saved. A defrost thermostat opens the heater circuit when the evaporator temperature rises above a preset temperature, 40°F (5°C) or more, thereby preventing excessive heating of the freezer compartment. The defrost timer is such that either the compressor or the <b>defrost</b> <b>heater</b> is on, but not both at the same time.|$|E
5000|$|Freezers with {{automatic}} defrosting and combined refrigerator/freezer units which also apply self defrosting to their freezer compartment are called [...] "frost free". The latter usually feature an air {{connection between the}} two compartments with the air passage to the refrigerator compartment regulated by a damper. By this means, a controlled portion of the air coming from the freezer reaches the refrigerator. Some older models have no air circulation between their freezer and refrigerator sections. Instead, they use an independent cooling system (for example: an evaporator coil with a <b>defrost</b> <b>heater</b> and a circulating fan in the freezer and a cold-plate or open-coil evaporator in the refrigerator.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine the}} potential energy savings associated with implementing demand defrost strategies to defrost supermarket refrigerated display case evaporators, as compared to the widely accepted current practice of controlling display case defrost cycles with a preset timer. The <b>defrost</b> <b>heater</b> energy use of several representative display case types was evaluated. In addition, demand defrost strategies for refrigerated display cases as well as those used in residential refrigerator/freezers were evaluated. Furthermore, it is anticipated that future work will include identifying a preferred defrost strategy, with input from Retail Energy Alliance members. Based on this strategy, a demand defrost system will be designed which is suitable for supermarket refrigerated display cases. Limited field testing of the preferred defrost strategy will be performed in a supermarket environment...|$|E
5000|$|PTC ceramic elements: PTC ceramic {{material}} {{is named for}} its positive thermal coefficient of resistance (i.e., resistance increases upon heating). Most ceramics have a negative coefficient, whereas most metals have positive values. While metals do become slightly more resistant at higher temperatures, this class of ceramics (often barium titanate and lead titanate composites) has a highly nonlinear thermal response, so that it becomes extremely resistive above a composition-dependent threshold temperature. This behavior causes the material to act as its own thermostat, since current passes when it is cool, and does not when it is hot. Thin films of this material are used in automotive rear-window <b>defrost</b> <b>heaters,</b> and honeycomb-shaped elements are used in more expensive hair dryers and space heaters.|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study an experimental testing apparatus was constructed and {{used to measure the}} defrosting efficiency of different heaters working under different control strategies. Based on the results obtained two <b>defrosting</b> <b>heaters</b> (one calrod and one distributed) and two control strategies (constant power and steps mode) were selected for this study. In the original mode the power was held at 160 W for 17. 0 and 19. 3 min for the distributed and the calrod heaters, respectively. In the steps mode the power was gradually reduced from 160 to 20 W, and the defrost length was set to 28. 5 and 22. 3 min, respectively, for the distributed and calrod heaters. Energy consumption tests were carried out following the ISO and AHAM standards, using the same top-mount frost-free refrigerator. Changes were implemented in the electronic board in order to vary the power and length of the steps. A glass window was installed in the rear wall of the refrigerator to visually monitor the defrosting process. A 4. 3 % drop in the energy consumptions obtained applying the two standards was achieved by replacing the calrod heater and the constant power mode with the distributed heater and the steps mode. Clogging tests were also carried out, using an automatic door-opening device to check the robustness of the different defrosting systems...|$|R
40|$|Refrigeration {{systems in}} chilled rooms in 15 plants {{processing}} {{a variety of}} foods were studied. These included plants processing raw meat and salads, Chinese ready meals, dairy products, slicing and packing of cooked meats and catering establishments. An initial survey of total numbers of microbes at a total of 891 sites on evaporators, drip trays and chilled room walls was followed up with a more detailed examination of 336 sites with high counts, selecting for Listeria spp., coliforms, enterococci, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. Temperatures (particularly air on and air off, maximum and near <b>defrost</b> <b>heaters)</b> relative humidity, airflow, layout and cleaning regimes were surveyed. In general, no correlation could be found between any of the physical measurements and the numbers and types of bacteria detected. Maximum mean temperatures in the chilled rooms varied from - 1 to + 16. 9 °C and few chilled units were regularly cleaned. Twenty five percent of sites examined had more than 105 colony-forming units per cm 2, although, very few pathogens or faecal indicator bacteria were detected. Listeria spp. were not found and coliforms were found only once, in low numbers. Low numbers of S. aureus or B. cereus were present in 9 of the 15 plants, B. cereus was found on evaporators and associated drip trays in two catering plants and two plants processing cooked meat. Enterococci and S. aureus were found most frequently in a raw red meat slaughterhouse (always in low numbers). In general, microbial contamination was lower in rooms where wrapped rather than unwrapped products were stored. The type of product also affected the degree of contamination, with raw red meat and poultry or dry ingredients giving highest counts, and raw vegetables and cooked products lowest. The work demonstrated that bacteria were present on evaporator cooling coils in all factory cold rooms visited. Although evaporator-cleaning procedures were carried out in some factories as part of routine maintenance these were not shown to be effective at maintaining low levels of bacteria on evaporators. To maintain evaporator hygiene {{it is suggested that}} more regular cleaning procedures, possibly by means of automated cleansing systems, should be considered. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|An {{evaporator}} {{test stand}} has been designed, sized, constructed, calibrated and operated {{to investigate the}} evaporator performance degradation for low temperature refrigeration applications. Measurements have been taken of air- and refrigerant-side temperatures, refrigerant-side pressures, air- and refrigerant-side differential pressures, air- and refrigerant-side mass flow rate and the power consumption of the electric <b>defrost</b> <b>heater.</b> The system is designed {{to work as a}} commercial refrigeration system for low temperature applications including freezing and defrost cycles. A manual and automatic defrost control has been designed and tested. The calculated values are the air- and refrigerant-side capacities. The tests have shown that the system is able to accomplish all desired test conditions. The performance of the evaporator was evaluated continuously during testing. Its performance degraded constantly by accumulation of frost during each frosting cycle, which resulted in the loss of superheat towards the end of each cycle. The defrost operation could not restore the full capacity of the evaporator. The defrost cycle consists out of two phases, melting the ice and re-cooling the coil. The first phase melts all the ice of the coil but the drainage of the resulting water is incomplete. The re-cooling phase freezes the amount of water residue on the evaporator coil, which causes an accelerated frost formation in the following freezing cycle. All over this behavior causes an accelerated reduction in evaporator capacity and therefore earlier superheat loss. It has been investigated for two air flow rates. The comparison of cycles with different air flow rates showed that with an increased air flow rate the frost density increases and the free flow area of the air passage in the evaporator decreases more slowly...|$|E
40|$|Supermarkets {{represent}} one of {{the largest}} energy-intensive building groups in the commercial sector, consuming 2 to 3 million kWh/yr per store (ES- 1). Over half of this energy use is for the refrigeration of food display cases and storage coolers. Display cases are used throughout a supermarket for the merchandising of perishable food products. The cases are maintained at air temperatures ranging from - 10 to 35 F, depending upon the type of product stored. The operating characteristics and energy requirements of the refrigeration system are directly related to the refrigeration load. The sources of the display case refrigeration load consist of: (1) Moist and warm air infiltration through the open front of the case [...] air curtains are employed to inhibit this infiltration, but some ambient air is entrained, which adds a substantial portion to the refrigeration load. (2) Heat conduction through case panels and walls. (3) Thermal radiation from the ambient to the product and display case interior. (4) Internal thermal loads [...] the use of lights, evaporator fans, periodic <b>defrosts,</b> and antisweat <b>heaters</b> adds to the refrigeration load of the display case as well as directly consuming electric energy. The impact of each of these elements on the refrigeration load is very dependent upon case type (Figure ES- 1). For example, air infiltration is the most significant portion of the refrigeration load for open, multi-deck cases, while radiation is the largest part of the load for tub-type cases. The door anti-sweat heaters represent a major share of the refrigeration load for frozen food door reach-in cases. Figure ES- 2 shows the distribution of display cases in a typical supermarket (ES- 2). Open, multi-deck, medium temperature display cases typically comprise about half of the refrigerated fixtures in a store (ES- 3). In addition, medium temperature fixtures and storage coolers account for roughly 70 to 75 percent of the total store refrigeration load with open, multi-deck cases contributing about 3 / 4 of that fraction. Consequently, the focus of this investigation has tilted toward the open, vertical, multi-deck medium temperature case type. Various technologies and control methods are energy efficiency measures (EEMs) that could be applied to display cases and result in the reduction of the refrigeration load and of the energy consumption of the supermarket refrigeration system. An extensive evaluation of the EEMs was conducted in order to select those that met the following criteria: (1) Near-term implementation [...] All EEMs considered could be implemented with existing refrigeration hardware and technology. (2) Potential for energy-efficiency improvements [...] Energy savings and/or refrigeration load reduction must be obtained by the implementation of the EEM. (3) Enhancement of the ability to maintain target product temperature [...] Proper operation of the display case and maintenance of the stored product temperature could not be compromised by the use of the EEM. The energy impact of a number of viable display case EEMs was quantified by performing whole building hourly simulations. A special version of the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE- 2. 3) program was used to develop a model of a supermarket. The model was then calibrated using available end-use monitored data to increase confidence in simulation results...|$|R
