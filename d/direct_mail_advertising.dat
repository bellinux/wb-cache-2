25|$|Having vowed not {{to raise}} taxes, Romney found he could not {{completely}} close the budget deficits by cutting spending and raising fees alone. He sought additional revenue by pursuing changes in the business tax code to prevent businesses from evading payment of taxes. Businesses called these changes tax increases, but Romney defended them as the elimination of “loopholes.” Examples of specific changes and 'loophole' closures included blocking corporations from transferring intellectual property assets to shell companies in states with lower corporate tax rates, preventing banks and some corporations from avoiding taxes through paper restructurings, eliminating tax breaks for <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising,</b> and taxing sales of software downloaded over the internet (which had previously gone untaxed) the same as identical software purchased in brick-and-mortar stores. The Romney administration even sought an exemption {{to avoid having to}} comply with a federal law passed in 2004 that mandated that states like Massachusetts lower their corporate tax rates.|$|E

50|$|The term <b>advertising,</b> or <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> is used {{to refer}} to {{communications}} sent to potential customers or donors via the postal service and other delivery services. <b>Direct</b> <b>mail</b> is sent to customers based on criteria such as age, income, location, profession, buying pattern, etc. <b>Direct</b> <b>mail</b> includes <b>advertising</b> circulars, catalogs, free-trial CDs, pre-approved credit card applications, and other unsolicited merchandising invitations delivered by mail to homes and businesses.

The home owner must handle the piece and typically on a door hanger there is just one advertising message giving the advertiser great exposure.|$|R

50|$|For example, if {{a company}} spends $100,000 on a direct mail piece and it {{delivers}} $500,000 in incremental revenue, then the ROMI factor is 5.0. If the incremental contribution margin for that $500,000 in revenue is 60%, then the margin ROMI (the incremental margin for $100,000 of marketing spent) is $300,000 (= $500,000 x 60%). Of which, the $100,000 spent on <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> will be subtracted and the difference will be divided by the same $100,000. Every dollar expended in <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> <b>advertising</b> translates to an additional $2 on the company's bottom line.|$|E

A cluster analysis of 153 new financial products shows that 85 per cent of the products belong in one of three multi-channel distribution channels: a ‘Balanced’ strategy draws on all the distribution routes; ‘Network’ strategies utilise a network of outlets; ‘Arm's Length’ strategies employ those channels such as <b>direct</b> <b>mail,</b> <b>direct</b> response <b>advertising</b> or intermediaries that do not involve direct contact between company staff and customers. Finally, an association between the use of multiple channels, especially if they are used intensively, and success is demonstrated.

50|$|<b>Advertising</b> <b>mail,</b> {{also known}} as <b>direct</b> <b>mail</b> (by its senders), junk mail (by its recipients), {{mailshot}} or admail, is the delivery of advertising material to recipients of postal mail.
