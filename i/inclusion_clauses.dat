40|$|Girard d'Athée and the Men {{from the}} Touraine Their Roles under King John Clause 50 of Magna Carta 1215 proscribes {{a group of}} men who are never again to hold office in England. They are {{described}} as Girard d'Athée's relatives (parentes), and although some of their names appear, no reasons are given for their <b>inclusion</b> in the <b>clause.</b> This thesis traces the lives of Girard d'Athée and his group, from their origins in the Touraine, through their arrival in England, through their responsibilities and influence under John, concluding with a brief resumé of their careers under Henry III. It also analyses the reasons for the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>Clause</b> 50 in the 1215 version of Magna Carta. Were the men proscribed because of their foreign birth or because they abused their positions as servants of the king? Did the barons fear their military might, or merely object to their misdemeanours? Did the established baronage and zealous parvenus covet the rewards bestowed on Athée and his clan or were they simply jealous of the increasingly close friendship these men were forging with John? Or was the clause nothing more than the result of a personal vendetta against members of the clan? By comparing and contrasting the careers of the men from the Touraine with that of another contemporary of theirs from the same area, Peter de Maulay, who was not proscribed in Clause 50, a clear appreciation of their value to the king and country can be determined. A balanced judgement suggests that their actions justified the king's confidence in them, and that they did not deserve the censure and suspicion of the chroniclers, some influential members of the baronage, and several modern historians. ...|$|R

The use of project labor agreements {{is supported by the}} construction unions, and some political figures, who state that PLAs are needed to ensure that large, complex projects are completed on time and on schedule. According to those who support the use of such agreements, PLAs enable project owners to control costs and ensure that there are no disruptions to the construction schedule, for example from strikes. In particular, proponents of PLAs point to the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>clauses</b> in the agreement that agree to establish labor management problem solving committees that deal with scheduling, quality control, health and safety, and productivity problems during the project. They also state that PLAs ensure that the workforce hired has received training and is of high quality. The use of PLAs in large private construction projects such as the building of the New England Patriots' Gillette Stadium, are given as examples of how PLAs help project owners meet tight deadlines, according to supporters. In addition to the stated benefits to project owners, supporters of PLAs also say that PLA use has a positive impact on local communities, through set goals for local hiring and provision of education.|$|R

The most noticeable amendment to the Act is the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>clauses</b> associated with the designation and management of landslide-prone zones (including debris flow-prone zones). In this paper, we (1) introduce the clauses related to the designation and management of landslide-prone zones that {{were included in the}} amended Forest Protection Act, (2) examine their significance by reviewing the present status of related domestic laws and structural countermeasures such as sediment check dams for sediment-related disaster prevention, and (3) suggest the future directions of the procedure for the designation and cancellation of such zones, and their maintenance and institutional aspects. The establishment of an institutional device for the designation and management of landslide-prone zones has great significance in the aspect of (1) the establishment of a comprehensive management and prevention system for potential landslide-prone zones in forested areas where the hazard risk has been poorly recognized as compared with the flood risks in lowlands, and (2) the establishment of the basis for overcoming the limits of structural countermeasures according to limited budgets.

5000|$|The {{passage of}} the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) in 1933 led to {{increase}} in strike activity by the AFL and TUUL unions. [...] With {{the enactment of the}} NIRA and the <b>inclusion</b> of <b>Clause</b> 7(a), which provided many private-sector workers with a federally protected right to organize, union membership in the United States increased considerably. [...] Clause 7(a) of the NIRA was unclear regarding workers’ legal right to collective-bargaining representation. Therefore, many employers established company unions in an attempt to prevent workers from joining AFL, TUUL, or independent unions. [...] Nevertheless, the TUUL benefited from the National Industrial Recovery Act through significant increases in its membership. [...] At one point, the TUUL had an estimated membership of 125,000 to 130,000 members. [...] The CPUSA referred to the NIRA as “slave legislation” and considered its character to be protofascist. [...] This was largely because the National Industrial Recovery Act promoted the regulation of prices, wages, and production through a tripartite relationship of labor, capital, and the state. [...] CPUSA leader, Earl Browder, denounced the labor provisions of the NIRA as “the American version of Mussolini’s ‘corporative state,’ special state controlled labor unions closely tied up with and {{under the direction of the}} employers.” [...] Furthermore, the CPUSA viewed the NIRA as an attempt by the state, capital, and AFL leaders to deter militancy within labor unions.|$|R

Maximum Independent Set (MIS) is a {{well-known}} NP-hard graph problem, tightly related with other well known NP-hard graph problems, namely Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC) and Maximum Clique (MaxClq).

The reduction naturally maps the vertices of a graph into clauses, without requiring the <b>inclusion</b> of hard <b>clauses.</b> Moreover, it is shown that the proposed reduction uses fewer variables and clauses than the existing alternative of mapping MIS into Maximum Satisfiability (Max-SAT).

The experimental evalu-ation considered the reductions described in the paper as well as existing state-of-the-art approaches.
