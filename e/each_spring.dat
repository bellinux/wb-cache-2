Aylward's daughter Julia had died in 1862 aged 15 and is buried in the churchyard; her grave was planted with snowdrops at her mother's request, which still bloom <b>each</b> <b>spring.</b> Julia Aylward is also commemorated by a piece of Burlison and Grylls glass in the lancet window at {{the west end of}} the north aisle.|$|E

5|$|In these {{countries}} {{there is little}} need, and no option but for ewes to lamb outdoors as there are insufficient structures to handle the large flocks of ewes there.

Australian graziers, too, do not receive the financial support that governments in other countries provide to sheep breeders.

Multibody system (MBS) modeling techniques were used to develop a full vehicle model with suspension system representation, which was subsequently validated against experimental data. The resultant multivariable ride control problem was then decoupled in the-frequency domain by the application of equivalence transformation techniques. It is shown that diagonalization can be achieved for the range of primary ride frequencies, and that the decoupled system then consists of three single-input/single-output (SISO) systems, one for <b>each</b> of the <b>sprung</b> mass modes.

Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran and sends him to the depths of the ocean, but the effort of keeping him confined there along with her other benevolent labours during the summer exhaust her, until in the autumn Teran takes advantage of her weakness to wrest control from her once again.|$|E

The water is too swift for open canoes, so visitors are asked to use kayaks. The swimming area is closed to whitewater boating during the summer months.|$|E

5|$|The trade route {{on which}} Thistle lies {{was used by}} Native American tribes {{before the arrival of}} European settlers; two Ute chiefs, Taby and Peteetneet, led {{seasonal}} migrations through the canyon <b>each</b> <b>spring</b> and fall. The first recorded journey by Europeans to modern Thistle was the Dominguez–Escalante Expedition, which was escorted through the territory by Indian guides. A small group of Utes inhabiting the canyon frequently clashed with newcomers, and as a result were forcibly relocated in the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to water storage and regulation, {{the system has}} a hydroelectric capacity of over 2,000 megawatts, and provides recreation and flood control with its twenty dams and reservoirs. It has allowed major cities to grow along Valley rivers which previously would flood <b>each</b> <b>spring,</b> and transformed the semi-arid desert environment of the San Joaquin Valley into productive farmland. Freshwater stored in Sacramento River reservoirs and released downriver during dry periods prevents salt water from intruding into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta during high tide. There are eight divisions {{of the project and}} ten corresponding units, many of which operate in conjunction, while others are independent {{of the rest of the}} network. California agriculture and related industries now directly account for 7% of the gross state product for which the CVP supplied water for about half.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} days of Wyoming most of the land was in public domain, which was open to stock raising as an open range and farmlands for homesteading. Large numbers of cattle were turned loose on the open range by large ranches. <b>Each</b> <b>spring,</b> round-ups were held to {{separate}} the cattle belonging to different ranches. Before a roundup, an orphan or stray calf was sometimes surreptitiously branded, which was the common way to identify the cow's owners. Lands and water rights were usually distributed to whoever settled the property first, and farmers and ranchers had to respect these boundaries (the doctrine was known as Prior Appropriation). However, as more and more homesteaders moved into Wyoming, competition for land and water soon enveloped the state, and the cattle companies reacted by monopolizing large areas of the open range to prevent newcomers from using it. They also forbade their employees from owning cattle for fear of additional competition, and threatened anyone they suspected to be rustlers.|$|E
5|$|The Nebula Awards {{annually}} {{recognize the}} best works {{of science fiction}} or fantasy published in the United States. The awards are organized and awarded by the Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of America (SFWA), a nonprofit association of professional science fiction and fantasy writers.

A fifth category for film and television episode scripts was given 1974–78 and 2000–09. The rules governing the Nebula Awards have changed {{several times during the}} awards' history, most recently in 2010.

5|$|A {{detachment}} of two Chinooks designated the Rotary Wing Group operated in Afghanistan during 2006 to 2007 and 2008 to 2013. The initial detachment arrived at Kandahar International Airport in March 2006, and was tasked with supporting the Australian Special Forces Task Group in the country. The upgrades the helicopters had received proved successful, and {{allowed them to}} operate in combat alongside other Coalition CH-47s. After the Special Forces Task Group was withdrawn in September 2006 the helicopters remained {{in the country and}} were used to support Coalition forces, with a particular emphasis on the Australian units located in Urozgan Province. The detachment was withdrawn to Australia in February 2007, and did not deploy again until February 2008. During this period all six helicopters received upgrades, which included new engines and blue force tracker equipment. During subsequent years the detachment was withdrawn to Australia during the Afghan winters, and redeployed <b>each</b> <b>spring.</b> By the end of the final rotation on 14 September 2013 the helicopters had flown more than 6,000 hours in combat and transported almost 40,000 personnel. Preparing for and sustaining the Rotary Wing Group rotations absorbed most of C Squadron's resources throughout this period, and Chinooks were rarely available for other Army training or operational tasks.|$|E
