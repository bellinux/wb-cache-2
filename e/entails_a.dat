25|$|The {{simplest}} {{differentiation between}} Mann's {{two types of}} state power is that despotic power is power over society, while infrastructural power is power through society.

25|$|A further {{option is}} to examine a state's {{willingness}} {{to act as a}} great power. As a nation will seldom declare that it is acting as such, this usually <b>entails</b> <b>a</b> retrospective examination of state conduct.

25|$|We can {{extrapolate}} {{from the}} above table that the step size needed to get an answer that is correct to three decimal places is approximately 0.00001, meaning that we need 400,000 steps. This large number of steps <b>entails</b> <b>a</b> high computational cost. For this reason, people usually employ alternative, higher-order methods such as Runge–Kutta methods or linear multistep methods, especially if a high accuracy is desired.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{aspects of}} the opera conform to an {{eighteenth-century}} European view of orientalism. The Pasha's titular harem, for example, reprised themes of sexual libertinage. And the comically sinister overseer, Osmin, is a send-up of earlier stereotypes of Turkish despotism. However, the opera also defies the stereotype of despotic Turkish culture, since its climax <b>entails</b> <b>a</b> selfless act of forgiveness {{on the part of}} the Pasha.|$|E

Several studies have identified a number of these neurotransmitters, as well as their receptors, that exhibit a marked alteration in different regions of the brain as part of the normal aging process.|$|E
25|$|Umlaut or {{mutation}} is an assimilatory process {{acting on}} vowels preceding a vowel or semivowel {{of a different}} vowel backness. In the case of i-umlaut and ʀ-umlaut, this <b>entails</b> <b>a</b> fronting of back vowels, with retention of lip rounding. In the case of u-umlaut, this entails labialization of unrounded vowels. Umlaut is phonemic and in many situations grammatically significant as {{a side effect of}} losing the Proto-Germanic morphological suffixes whose vowels created the umlaut allophones.|$|E

To factorize the integer n, Fermat's method <b>entails</b> <b>a</b> {{search for a}} single number a, n1/2, such that a2 mod n is a square. But these a are hard to find. The quadratic sieve consists of computing a2 mod n for several a, then finding a subset of these whose product is a square. This will yield a congruence of squares.|$|E
25|$|In general, most oncologists rely on {{combinations}} of drugs for the initial, induction phase of chemotherapy. Such combination chemotherapy usually offers {{the benefits of}} early remission and a lower risk of disease resistance. Consolidation and maintenance treatments are intended to prevent disease recurrence. Consolidation treatment often <b>entails</b> <b>a</b> repetition of induction chemotherapy or the intensification chemotherapy with additional drugs. By contrast, maintenance treatment involves drug doses that are lower than those administered during the induction phase.|$|E
