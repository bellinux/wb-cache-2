5|$|At 17:00 on 3 May, Fletcher was {{notified}} that the Japanese Tulagi invasion force had been sighted {{the day before}} approaching the southern Solomons. Unable {{to communicate with the}} Lexington task force because of the need to maintain radio silence, Yorktowns task force proceeded independently toward Guadalcanal in order to be <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> launch airstrikes against the Japanese forces at Tulagi the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo got {{the ball}} back at their own 21-yard line and were only able to advance it to their 34-yard line before punting the ball back to Connecticut. UConn cornerback Jasper Howard {{returned}} the ball 26yards to the Bulls' 41-yard line. The Huskies handed the ball to Donald Brown for five straight running plays, advancing {{the ball to the}} Buffalo 19-yard line as the first quarter clock expired. At {{the end of the first}} quarter, UConn held a 7–3 lead and looked to be <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> score more when the second quarter began.|$|E
5|$|Illyrians soon {{captured}} and later fortified Dyrrachium (modern-day Durrës, Albania) and Phoenice (which was soon liberated with a truce and a fee). While her ships {{were off the}} coast of Onchesmos, they intercepted and plundered some Roman merchant vessels. Teuta's forces extended their operations further southward into the Ionian Sea, defeating the combined Achaean and Aetolian fleet in the battle of Paxos and capturing the island of Corcyra, which put them <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> breach the important trade routes between the mainland of Greece and the Greek cities in Italy.|$|E

5|$|In September 2009, {{more than}} two years after the accident, CENIPA {{announced}} the results of official investigations.

5|$|It was {{not until}} 09:00 that the 1st RUR were <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> carry out a left {{flanking}} attack on Longuerval. The village was clear of Germans so they pressed on towards Sainte-Honorine. When between the two villages, the battalion was engaged by German mortar, artillery and assault gun fire, and suffered several casualties. Two companies managed to reach Sainte-Honorine, but with no artillery fire support of their own, and out of radio contact with their battalion headquarters, {{they were forced to}} withdraw back to Longueval.|$|E
5|$|The German {{were forced}} to {{withdraw}} from the north of the Orne but Allied forces were unable to push beyond the Orne. German forces were dug-in on the opposite bank <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> block a move south. Montgomery called off an advance beyond the Orne as further attacks would be too costly for the gains made, which had inflicted much attrition on the defenders. For French public opinion the operation was a coup; civilians now believed the liberation of France was truly under way.|$|E

5|$|The war also {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of Athens' resurgence as a power in the Greek world. With their walls and their fleet restored, the Athenians were <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> turn their eyes overseas. By the middle of the 4th century, they had assembled an organization of Aegean states commonly known as the Second Athenian Empire, regaining at least parts of what they had lost with their defeat in 404 BC.|$|E
5|$|After {{two seasons}} in Kansas City, the {{franchise}} moved to Denver and was renamed the Colorado Rockies it {{played at the}} McNichols Sports Arena. The team won its first game as the Rockies, 4–2, against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The Rockies were <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> qualify for the playoffs 60 games into the 1976–77 season, but a streak of 18 games without a win caused them to fall from contention. The Rockies ended the campaign last in the division with a 20–46–14 record and 54 points, and improved to 59 points the next season. Despite having the sixth-worst record in the League, the Rockies beat-out the Vancouver Canucks for second in the Division by two points and gained a playoff berth. The Philadelphia Flyers eliminated the Rockies from the playoffs in the preliminary rounds.|$|E
5|$|An {{infantry}} battalion, {{forming the}} right flank of Abd el-Hamid's 16th Brigade, was <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> defend the Lexicon-Tirtur crossroads. Initially, Reshef sent two armored battalions northward on Lexicon. As the Israeli tanks neared the infantry battalion, they {{were met by}} heavy fire from anti-tank weapons. They lost 27 tanks during this engagement, although seven Israeli tanks managed {{to break through the}} battalion's westernmost position on Lexicon and advance northwards to al-Galaa'. Thereafter, 'Abd el-Hamid ordered tank-hunting squads – groups of ten equipped with RPG-7 rockets and RPG-43 grenades – to deploy around al-Galaa' and destroy those tanks that broke through; he also sent a tank company to reinforce the infantry battalion.|$|E

5|$|At 02:45 on 10 May, in {{conjunction}} with the ground assault on the Ngok Tavak outpost, elements of the VPA 2nd Division subjected Khâm Đức to a heavy barrage of mortar fire. The North Vietnamese 21st Regiment, later reinforced by the VC 1st Regiment, were <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> attack the U.S.-led Detachment A-105. At 08:30, the Americal Division activated Operation Golden Valley to reinforce the beleaguered Khâm Đức Special Forces Camp, and at 8:45am the division requested permission from III MAF to change the reaction force so the 2nd Battalion, 1st Infantry Regiment, 196th Light Infantry Brigade (2–1st Inf) would replace the 1st Battalion, 46th Infantry Regiment, 198th Light Infantry Brigade (1–46th Inf). In the meantime, however, Company A of 1–46th Inf provide the needed reinforcement, until the 2–1st Inf was in position. At around 10:50 Company A of 1–46th Infantry – led by Lieutenant Bobby Thompson – arrived in Khâm Đức along with some supporting artillery and ammunition, and they were immediately assigned to their task.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{gripped the}} bat very {{low on the}} handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{outbreak}} of World War II, Deutschland and Admiral Graf Spee were deployed to the Atlantic to put them <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> attack Allied merchant traffic once war was declared. Admiral Scheer remained in port for periodic maintenance. Deutschland was not particularly successful on her raiding sortie, during which she sank or captured three ships. She then returned to Germany where she was renamed Lützow. Admiral Graf Spee sank nine vessels in the South Atlantic before she was confronted by three British cruisers at the Battle of the River Plate. Although she damaged the British ships severely, she was herself damaged and her engines were in poor condition. Coupled with false reports of British reinforcements, {{the state of the}} ship convinced Hans Langsdorff, her commander, to scuttle the ship outside Montevideo.|$|E

5|$|By 05:45 {{telephone}} communication to Ottoman front line units {{had been cut}} and five minutes later all German and Ottoman reserves had been ordered forward. All telephone, telegraph and wireless communications from the Eighth Army headquarters at Tulkarm were cut at 07:00. Although the Eighth Army headquarters survived the EEF infantry onslaught, they had lost contact with the 7th and 19th Divisions (XXII Corps). Liman von Sanders ordered the 46th Infantry Division (Eighth Army reserve) forward towards Et Tire. The division's two regiments were ordered forward at 08:00. One regiment reinforced the 20th Division's position at Kabak Tepe while the second regiment fortified Sehpali Tepe, near XXII Corps headquarters. By 09:00 Seventh Army communications with Yildirim Army Group at Nazareth had also been cut. Liman von Sanders learned at that time, from the Asia Corps at 'Azzun via the Seventh Army headquarters, that the trench lines on the coastal sector had been breached and cavalry were advancing northwards. By 10:00 {{the weight of the}} EEF infantry and artillery attack had forced the XXII Corps to retreat and Yildirim Army Group had no combat formations <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> stop the cavalry advance up the coast.|$|E
5|$|By about noon, the Confederates {{had formed}} an attack line and were <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> advance on the works. Because {{of the forest}} {{on the west side}} of the Mauckport Road, a company of men {{dismounted}} and attacked the works head on. They were repulsed three times, but the Legion suffered a casualty during the second wave. Simultaneously, the Confederates launched a flanking maneuver on the eastern wing of the defensive works. The initial flanking attempt was prevented because of the superior weapons held by the thirty Legion soldiers on that wing. They were equipped with Henry rifles capable of firing fourteen rounds before reloading, and were able to keep the Confederates pinned down in the open field for about twenty minutes.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Hecht-Hill-Lancaster {{acquired}} Success, Lehman was <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> not only adapt his own novellette but also produce and direct the film. After scouting locations, Lehman {{was told by}} Hecht that distributor United Artists was having second thoughts about going with a first-time director, so Hecht offered the film to Mackendrick. Initially the director had reservations about trying to film such a dialogue-heavy screenplay, so he and Lehman worked on it for weeks {{to make it more}} cinematic. As the script neared completion, Lehman became ill and had to resign from the picture. James Hill took over and offered Paddy Chayefsky as Lehman’s replacement. Mackendrick suggested Clifford Odets, the playwright whose reputation as a left-wing hero had been tarnished after he named names before the House Un-American Activities Committee.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Beatty's battlecruisers were <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> block Hipper's chosen egress route, {{while other}} forces were {{en route to}} {{complete}} the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the IIScouting Group began {{to pass through the}} British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted Stralsund and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper's ships, however those were some 50km (31mi) ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.|$|E
5|$|Group Captain James Stagg of the Royal Air Force (RAF) met Eisenhower on {{the evening}} of 4 June. He and his {{meteorological}} team predicted that the weather would improve enough for the invasion to proceed on 6 June. The next available dates with the required tidal conditions (but without the desirable full moon) would be two weeks later, from 18 to 20 June. Postponement of the invasion would have required recalling men and ships already <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> cross the Channel, and would have increased the chance that the invasion plans would be detected. After much discussion with the other senior commanders, Eisenhower decided that the invasion should go ahead on the 6th. A major storm battered the Normandy coast from 19 to 22 June, which would have made the beach landings impossible.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} {{week of the}} season, however, Indiana {{suffered}} its first loss: a 2715 conference defeat {{at the hands of}} No.22 Wisconsin. The Hoosiers recovered from the setback, however, and won their next four games—all of which were against Big Ten opponents. The fourth of those victories came against the Michigan State Spartans, who had replaced Wisconsin at the No.22 spot in the country. Indiana held the Spartans scoreless in a tough defensive battle, earning a 100 victory. With a 71 record, Indiana appeared to be <b>in</b> <b>position</b> <b>to</b> compete for the Big Ten championship, but consecutive losses to highly ranked Penn State and Ohio State put an end to any thoughts of a championship. The Hoosiers ended the season with a 2417 win over traditional rival Purdue and accepted a bid to the Independence Bowl.|$|E
