The CLEA SGVs are not directly applicable to a site completely covered in hardstanding, as there is no direct exposure route to contaminated soils. To date, the first ten of fifty-five contaminant SGVs have been published, for the following: arsenic, cadmium, chromium, lead, inorganic mercury, nickel, selenium <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzene,</b> phenol and toluene. Draft SGVs for benzene, naphthalene and xylene have been produced but their publication is on hold. Toxicological data (Tox) has been published for each of these contaminants as well as for benzoapyrene, benzene, dioxins, furans and dioxin-like PCBs, naphthalene, vinyl chloride, 1,1,2,2 tetrachloroethane and 1,1,1,2 tetrachloroethane, 1,1,1 trichloroethane, tetrachloroethene, carbon tetrachloride, 1,2-dichloroethane, trichloroethene and xylene. The SGVs for <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzene,</b> phenol and toluene are dependent on the soil organic matter (SOM) content (which can be calculated from the total organic carbon (TOC) content).

50|$|Styrene is {{separated}} from <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzene</b> in a very tall continuously packed distillation tower. This separation is difficult because of the close boiling points of ethylbenzene and styrene; 136 degrees C and 145 degrees C respectively. This column is the tallest distillation column in Australia. The ethylbenzene {{coming out of the}} column is recycled to the Alkylation plant. To prevent the self polymerization of the styrene at the temperatures in the column an inhibitor is added to the mixture of ethylbenzene and styrene before it enters the column. There are two other distillation columns in this plant. All three operate under vacuum. Pure styrene is transferred to the tank farm. Styrene is a clear colourless liquid with a sickly sweet odour.|$|E

Spills on the roads leading to the landfill were common according to local residents. In addition, local residents reported seeing leachate flowing into an unnamed creek along Andrew Avenue. Leachate is produced by rain percolating {{into the ground and}} coming into contact with contaminated waste buried in the landfill. Leachate overflow has been a problem at the site. In the late 1980s, leachate collected in the leachate system, overflowed a manhole on the Laurel Park site entering a stream that passes by several residences and a school playground.

Outer hair cell (OHC) loss was found in the corresponding cochlear regions. In contrast, guinea pigs showed no threshold shifts and no OHC loss after exposure to much higher <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzene</b> levels (2500 ppm, 6 h/day, 5 days). Subsequently, a limited study (four rats and four guinea pigs) was performed in an attempt to understand these differences in susceptibility. <b>Ethyl</b> <b>benzene</b> concentration in blood was determined in both species after exposure to 500 -ppm <b>ethyl</b> <b>benzene</b> (8 h/day, 3 days).
