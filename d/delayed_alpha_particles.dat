Groups of <b>delayed</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> were observed {{only from the}} first, second and fourth of these levels. The beta-unstable parent nuclei were formed through (d,p) reactions on B^(11), N^(15), and F^(19), after which the <b>delayed</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> were observed {{for a period of}} time comparable to the half-life of the beta-decay process. The beta-decay branching ratio to the 9. 59 -Mev level in O^(16) was measured and is equal to (1. 4 ± 0. 2) • 10 ^(- 5) corresponding to a log ft (9. 59) = 6. 5 ± 0. 2. The beta-decay branching ratio to the 9. 85 -Mev level was found to be less than 2. 7 • 10 ^(- 7) which corresponds to a log ft (9. 85) ≥ 7. 2 ± 0. 2. The ratio of the decay probability for alpha-particle emission to the total decay probability for the 8. 88 -Mev level was found to be ^(Г_α) /_(Г_Τ) ≤ 6. 6 • 10 ^(- 5). This results in a lower limit for the amplitude of the parity nonconserving term in the nuclear potential of F ≤ 1. 5 • 10 ^(- 5) where the following quantities were used: θ^ 2 _(α 2) = 0. 007 and Г_y = 10 ^(- 3) ev. Alpha-particle emission was not observed from the 5. 63 -Mev level or the 5. 80 -Mev level in Ne^(20). Limits on the log ft value to these levels were obtained: log ft (5. 63) ≥ 8. 0 ± 0. 5; log ft (5. 80) ≥ 8. 0 ± 0. 3. These large values for the log it are consistent with the assigned spin and parity of the levels involved in the beta-decay process...|$|E

40|$|The BiPo {{project is}} {{dedicated}} to the measurement of extremely low radioactive contaminations of SuperNEMO ββ source foils (208 Tl < 2 µBq/kg and 214 Bi < 10 µBq/kg). A modular BiPo 1 prototype with its 20 modules and its shielding test facility is running in the Modane Underground Laboratory since February, 2008. The goal of this prototype is to study the backgrounds and particularly the surface contamination of plastic scintillators. After 2 months, a preliminary upper limit on the sensitivity of a 10 m 2 BiPo detector in 208 Tl contamination of selenium source foils can be extrapolated to: A (208 Tl) < 7. 5 µBq/kg (90 % C. L.). The BiPo detector {{is dedicated to}} the measurement of the high radiopurity levels in 214 Bi and 208 Tl of very thin materials and especially the double beta source foils of the SuperNEMO detector 1. The expected sensitivity is A (208 Tl) < 2 µBq/kg and A (214 Bi) < 10 µBq/kg. In order to measure 208 Tl and 214 Bi contaminations, the original idea of the BiPo detector is to detect the so-called BiPo process, which corresponds to the detection by organic scintillators of an electron followed by a <b>delayed</b> <b>alpha</b> <b>particle.</b> The 214 Bi isotope is nearly a pure β emitter (Qβ = 3. 27 MeV) decaying into 214 Po, an α emitter with a half-life of 164 µs (Fig. 1). The 208 Tl isotope is measured by detecting its parent the 212 Bi isotope. 212 Bi decays with a branching ratio of 64 % via a β emission towards 212 Po (Qβ = 2. 25 MeV) which is again an α emitter with a short half-life of 300 ns. So, for these two chains a BiPo signature is an electron associated to a delayed α with a delay time depending on the isotope contamination we want to measure. 23...|$|R

40|$|A burning Deuterium-Tritium plasma is {{one which}} depends upon fusion-produced <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> for self-heating. Whether a plasma can reach a burning state {{requires}} {{knowledge of the}} transport of <b>alpha</b> <b>particles,</b> and turbulence is one such source of transport. The <b>alpha</b> <b>particle</b> distribution in collisional equilibrium forms a non-Maxwellian tail which spans orders of magnitude in energy, {{and it is this}} tail that is responsible for heating the plasma. Newly-born high-energy <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are not expected to respond to turbulence as strongly as <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> that have slowed down to the bulk plasma temperature. This dissertation presents a low-collisionality derivation of gyrokinetics relevant for <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> and describes the upgrades made to the GS 2 flux-tube code to handle general non-Maxwellian energy distributions. With the ability to run self-consistent simulations with a population of <b>alpha</b> <b>particles,</b> we can examine certain assumptions commonly made about <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> in the context of microturbulence. It is found that microturbulence can compete with collisional slowing-down, altering the distribution further.

30|$|By taking {{advantage}} of the heavy ion transport models in PHITS, we have estimated neutron production by GCR protons and heavy components. Accurate calculation of the heavy ion reactions and transportation are important when estimating the neutron and gamma ray production from GCR. Although the amount of heavy nuclei (Z ≥ 2) in the GCR flux is small relative to that of protons, the neutron and gamma ray production rates by heavy ions are much larger than those by the protons. Therefore, neutron production from heavy ion reactions should be taken into account. The neutron production from <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> is of particular importance because <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> are more abundant than other heavy nuclei (Z > 2). The neutrons produced by the protons and <b>alpha</b> <b>particles</b> form the major part of the total neutron density profile produced by all the nuclides in the GCR.
