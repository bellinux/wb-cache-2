5|$|Hospice {{care in the}} United States is a {{type and}} {{philosophy}} of end-of-life care which focuses on the palliation of a terminally ill patient's symptoms. These symptoms can be physical, emotional, spiritual or social in nature. The concept of hospice {{as a place to}} treat the incurably ill has been evolving since the 11th century. Hospice care was introduced to the United States in the 1970s in response to the work of Cicely Saunders in the United Kingdom. This part of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>has</b> expanded as people face a variety of issues with terminal illness. In the United States, it is distinguished by extensive use of volunteers and a greater emphasis on the patient's psychological needs in coming to terms with dying.|$|E
25|$|The {{availability}} of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>has</b> also reduced infant mortality from 70 per 1000 live births in 1948 to 12.1 in 2009 and raised life expectancy at birth from 60 years to 76. Though these figures compare favorably with global averages, they {{fall short of}} levels in developed nations and in 2006, Argentina ranked fourth in Latin America.|$|E
25|$|Disease {{and infant}} {{mortality}} {{increased in the}} 1960s immediately after the revolution, when half of Cuba's 6,000 doctors left the country. Recovery occurred by the 1980s, and the country's <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>has</b> been widely praised. The Communist government asserted that universal health care was a priority of state planning and progress was made in rural areas. Like {{the rest of the}} Cuban economy, medical care suffered from severe material shortages following the end of Soviet subsidies in 1991, and a tightening of the U.S. embargo in 1992.|$|E
40|$|Delivery of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> in the United States {{has become}} {{increasingly}} complex over the past 50 years, as <b>health</b> <b>care</b> markets <b>have</b> evolved, technology has diffused, population demographics have shifted, and cultural expectations of <b>health</b> and <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>have</b> been transformed.

50|$|Those {{involved}} with mental <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>have</b> developed so-called 'crisis cards' {{which may be}} used {{in the event of a}} mental health crisis.

25|$|As {{the quality}} of <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>has</b> {{increasingly}} become an issue around the world, hospitals have increasingly had to pay serious attention to this matter. Independent external assessment of quality {{is one of the}} most powerful ways to assess this aspect of health care, and hospital accreditation is one means by which this is achieved. In many parts of the world such accreditation is sourced from other countries, a phenomenon known as international healthcare accreditation, by groups such as Accreditation Canada from Canada, the Joint Commission from the USA, the Trent Accreditation Scheme from Great Britain, and Haute Authorité de santé (HAS) from France.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility for <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>has</b> been devolved to the Scottish Parliament {{since it}} was {{established}} in 1999. The Scottish government has enacted health policies which {{are different from those}} in England, such as abolishing charges for prescriptions and elderly personal care. NHS Scotland has been operationally independent of the NHS {{in the rest of the}} United Kingdom since the formation of the NHS in 1948. Supporters of independence argue that independence is needed because possible reductions in the NHS budget in England would result in reduced funding for Scotland, which would make it difficult to maintain the existing service. Harry Burns, a former chief medical officer for Scotland, said in July 2014 that he thought independence could be beneficial for public health because it may give people greater control of their lives.|$|E
25|$|Since LGBT {{people began}} to {{organize}} for their social and legal rights, access to equal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>has</b> remained an important but often not primary issue. LGBT-specific health organizations have been formed, including charities educating on specific issues, health clinics, and even professional organizations for LGBT people and their allies. Many of them have advocated for specific changes to various governmental practices, and the ongoing effort to legalize same-sex marriage often includes examples of LGBT people unable to secure health coverage equivalent to that of their heterosexual counterparts. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) in the United States includes new protections for LGBT people. Under the ACA insurers can no longer turn someone away just because she or he is lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. In addition, ACA is funding preventive efforts for communities, including {{millions of dollars to}} use evidence-based interventions to address HIV-related health disparities. The Department of Health and Human Services is working with community centers serving the LGBT community to employ proven prevention strategies.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} improve {{communication}} and mutual understanding, <b>health</b> <b>care</b> systems <b>have</b> used the professionally trained interpreters to help <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers to communicate with patients whose English proficiency is limited. Studies have shown that trained professional interpreters or bilingual <b>health</b> <b>care</b> professionals <b>have</b> {{a positive effect on}} LEP patients' satisfaction, their quality of care, and outcomes.|$|R

25|$|Numerous {{publicly}} funded health care programs help {{to provide for}} the elderly, disabled, military service families and veterans, children, and the poor, and federal law ensures public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay; however, a system of universal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>has</b> not been implemented nationwide. However, as the OECD has pointed out, the total U.S. public expenditure for this limited population would, in most other OECD countries, be enough for the government to provide primary health insurance for the entire population. Although the federal Medicare program and the federal-state Medicaid programs possess some monopsonistic purchasing power, the highly fragmented buy side of the U.S. health system is relatively weak by international standards, and in some areas, some suppliers such as large hospital groups have a virtual monopoly on the supply side. In most OECD countries, there is a high degree of public ownership and public finance. The resulting economy of scale in providing health care services appears to enable a much tighter grip on costs. The U.S., as a matter of oft-stated public policy, largely does not regulate prices of services from private providers, assuming the private sector to do it better.|$|E
2500|$|A 2011 study led by Dr. RebeccaT. Brown in Boston, Massachusetts {{conducted}} by the Institute for Aging Research (an affiliate of Harvard Medical School), Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and the Boston Health Care for the Homeless Program found the elderly homeless population had [...] "higher rates of geriatric syndromes, including functional decline, falls, frailty and depression than seniors {{in the general population}} and that many of these conditions may be easily treated if detected". The report was published in the Journal of Geriatric Internal Medicine. There are government avenues which provide resources for the development of healthcare for the homeless. In the United States, the Bureau of Primary <b>Health</b> <b>Care</b> <b>has</b> a health care for the homeless program which provides grants to fund the delivery of healthcare to the homeless. According to 2011 UDS data community health centers were able to provide service to 1,087,431 homeless individuals. Furthermore, there are many nonprofit and religious organizations which provide healthcare services to the homeless. These organizations also contribute to the large need which exists for expanding healthcare for the homeless.|$|E
