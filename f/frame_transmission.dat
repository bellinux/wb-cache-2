30|$|For a bandwidth-efficient {{direct link}} communication, {{we need to}} reduce the number of polling <b>frame</b> <b>{{transmissions}}</b> in DCPIs because the transmissions of the polling frames on which the data frames are not usually piggybacked for the direct link communication are the scheduling overhead in the simultaneous and hybrid polling methods. While with the simultaneous polling method the AP should transmit the separate polling frames to poll the STAs for the direct link communication under the severe interference condition, with the hybrid polling method, the AP can reduce significantly the number of polling <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> using the connectivity among the STAs. The hybrid polling method can improve the MAC performance by reducing the scheduling overhead.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} a method and apparatus for scheduling data for transmission via {{at least two}} half-duplex time division multiple access connections, wherein for each connection respective capacities of data portions to a <b>transmission</b> <b>frame</b> are allocated so that the total capacity of all data portions of the <b>transmission</b> <b>frame</b> does not exceed a predetermined capacity for each transmission direction, and that the sum of capacities of data portions of each connection of the <b>transmission</b> <b>frame</b> in both <b>transmission</b> directions does not exceed the predetermined capacity. Then, the transmission timing of the data portions within the <b>transmission</b> <b>frame</b> is set {{in such a manner}} that transmission and reception intervals of each connection do not overlap. Accordingly, scheduling can be optimized to meet both QoS and half-duplex requirements...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we {{proposed}} the hybrid polling method for supporting direct link communication between STAs in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs. Compared with the simultaneous polling method {{proposed in the}} literature, the proposed polling method can improve the MAC performance by {{reducing the number of}} polling <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> using the connectivity among the STAs. Simulation results show that the proposed polling method is useful especially when the interference range is large.|$|R
50|$|WLAN data {{transmission}} collisions may still occur, and the MACA for Wireless (MACAW) is introduced {{to extend the}} function of MACA.

50|$|Figure 4 gives a basic example how frame {{pre-emption}} works. During {{the process}} of sending a best effort Ethernet frame, the MAC interrupts the <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> just {{before the start of}} the guard band. The partial frame is completed with a CRC and will be stored in the next switch to wait for the second part of the frame to arrive. After the high priority traffic in time slice 1 has passed and the cycle switches back to time slice 2, the interrupted <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> is resumed. Frame pre-emption always operates on a pure link-by-link basis and only fragments from one Ethernet switch to the next Ethernet switch, where the frame is reassembled. In contrast to fragmentation with the Internet Protocol (IP), no end-to-end fragmentation is supported.|$|E
50|$|More recently, raising {{transmit}} error outside <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> is used {{to indicate}} the transmit data lines are being used for special-purpose signalling.

30|$|For a bandwidth-efficient {{reliable}} multicast MAC protocol, it {{is important}} to reduce the bandwidth overhead due to the transmissions of the control packets. We proposed the new reliable multicast MAC protocol reducing the bandwidth overhead by reducing the RAK <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> and piggybacking the uplink data frames on the ACK frames. Our reliable multicast MAC protocol was shown to be useful especially when applications with relatively short data packets are served in IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs.|$|R

It abolishes the need for a reverse feedback mechanism usually essential to provide reliability in packet data transmission. Absence of a reverse feedback mechanism can substantially improve the performance of networks with half-duplex wireless channels (such as 802. 11 WLANs), where collisions between forward and reverse MAC <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> contribute significantly towards performance degradation. We propose a Markovian stochastic framework to model the performance of a simple FCT protocol in a single cell IEEE 802. 11 WLAN. Our model allows the WLAN Access Point to employ a generic rate control algorithm for MAC <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> on the downlink. Using renewal theory we provide an explicit expression for the average downlink throughput. ns 2 simulations are used to validate our model and the analytically obtained throughput metric. A detailed performance analysis study is then carried out to provide insights into the choice of various system parameters that can lead to optimal throughput performance.

50|$|The {{transmit}} clock is a free-running clock {{generated by the}} PHY based on the link speed (25 MHz for 100 Mbit/s, 2.5 MHz for 10 Mbit/s). The remaining transmit signals are driven by the MAC synchronously on the rising edge of TX_CLK. This arrangement allows the MAC to operate without having {{to be aware of}} the link speed. The transmit enable signal is held high during <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> and low when the transmitter is idle.|$|E
5000|$|A {{frame is}} a digital data {{transmission}} unit in computer networking and telecommunication. A frame typically includes frame synchronization features consisting of a sequence of bits or symbols that indicate to the receiver, the beginning, {{and end of the}} payload data within the stream of symbols or bits it receives. If a receiver is connected to the system {{in the middle of a}} <b>frame</b> <b>transmission,</b> it ignores the data until it detects a new frame synchronization sequence.|$|E
50|$|Transmit error may {{be raised}} {{for one or}} more clock periods during <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> to request the PHY to {{deliberately}} corrupt the frame in some visible way that precludes it from being received as valid. This {{may be used to}} abort a frame when some problem is detected after transmission has already started. The MAC may omit the signal if it has no use for this functionality, in which case the signal should be tied low for the PHY.|$|E

It is implemented for wireless QoS between RF media.|$|E
50|$|Just {{before the}} end of time slice 2 in cycle n, a new <b>frame</b> <b>{{transmission}}</b> is started. Unfortunately, this frame is too large to fit into its time slice. Since the transmission of this frame cannot be interrupted, the frame infringes the following time slice 1 of the next cycle n+1. By partially or completely blocking a time-critical time slice, real-time frames can be delayed up {{to the point where they}} cannot meet the application requirements any longer. This is very similar to the actual buffering effects that happen in non-TSN Ethernet switches, so TSN has to specify a mechanism to prevent this from happening.|$|E
50|$|The IEEE 802.1Qbv time-aware {{scheduler}} has {{to ensure}} that the Ethernet interface is not busy with the transmission of a frame when the scheduler changes from one time slice into the next. The time-aware scheduler achieves this by putting a guard band in front of every time slice that carries time-critical traffic. During this guard band time, no new Ethernet <b>frame</b> <b>transmission</b> may be started, only already ongoing transmissions may be finished. The duration of this guard band has to be {{as long as it takes}} the maximum frame size to be safely transmitted. For an Ethernet frame according to IEEE 802.3 with a single IEEE 802.1Q VLAN tag and including interframe spacing, the total length is: 1518 byte (frame) + 4 byte (VLAN Tag) + 12 byte (Interframe spacing) = 1534 byte.|$|E

In other scenarios such as mMTC or NB-IOT, though, latency constraints may be relaxed, such that pulse lengths of several symbols (K≥ 2) can be allowed if they provide clear benefits {{addressing the needs of}} the corresponding service.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Exploiting the {{increasing}} ubiquitous deployment of sensor networks, the paper presents a system called WiBee that utilizes ZigBee sensors to build real-time WiFi radio maps. The design of WiBee {{is motivated by}} the observation that a ZigBee radio can sense WiFi <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> although it cannot decode WiFi frames. A sensor passively listens on the wireless channel and estimates the RSS of a WiFi AP at its location. The design of WiBee faces three unique challenges. First, multiple APs may transmit frames concurrently and frame collisions may happen. Second, because of severe resource constraints, a sensor cannot sample the channel at arbitrarily high frequency and hence some <b>frame</b> <b>transmissions</b> may not be sampled. Third, sensor nodes are usually not time synchronized and the on-board clock is inaccurate. To address these challenges, we propose a novel gateway-assisted approach to estimating WiFi RSS values at ZigBee sensors. A light-weight algorithm is designed for identifying the RSS values corresponding to a given AP. It searches the sequence of ZigBee RSS samples for an AP signature sequence. An optimization technique is proposed to address issues of clock drift and time asynchronization. Our extensive experiments on a testbed show that WiBee can achieve low estimation error, short delay and small computation overhead...|$|R
