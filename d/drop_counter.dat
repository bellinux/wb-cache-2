40|$|ABSTRACT The {{relationship}} between the intestinal movements and the pancreatic juice secretion in the domestic chicken was studied. The main pancreatic ducts of commercial broiler-type chickens 12 to 14 weeks of age were cannulated, and the pancreatic secretions were recorded by a <b>drop</b> <b>counter.</b> Balloon catheters for monitoring the intestinal movements were implanted in the proximal duodena in the same animals. Feeding and drinking activities were monitored by photocells. The recordings from the <b>drop</b> <b>counter,</b> the balloon catheter, and the feeding and drinking activity monitor were made {{in relation to the}} time of day. These recordings indicated that the pancreatic secretory rate correlates with the pattern of intestinal movements of the proximal duodenum in the domestic chicken. The data also suggest the movement of chyme in the duodenum under ad libitum feeding conditions to be at a steady state during the light period. During the dark period, the intestinal movements and the flow of pancreatic juice are intermittent...|$|E
40|$|A <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> catching-type gauge and a tipping-bucket rain {{intensity}} gauge {{are compared}} {{in this paper}} in order to investigate the performance of suitable correction algorithms. Comparison {{in the field is}} performed at the resolution of 1 min by assuming the <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> as a working reference at low to medium rainfall rates. The observed deviations are mainly the result of sampling errors due to the low resolution (0. 5 mm) of the tipping-bucket. Two correction algorithms for this gauge are compared based on the knowledge of the time of tipping: since this is not actually available for the instrument in hand, numerical simulation is performed using information from the <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> at the resolution of 10 s. The first correction is obtained by distributing the tip volume over the inter-tip periods. The second algorithm further applies a "smoothing" procedure that redistributes the volume of initial, isolated and final types of tips according to climatology. Relative deviations of the one-minute rainfall intensity figures are used to assess improvements in the observed measurement performance. Sensitivity of the results upon varying the sampling resolution of a virtual tipping-bucket rain gauge is also investigated using numerical simulation. It is concluded that the knowledge of the time of tipping is essential to improve the performance of the tipping-bucket rain gauge. Distributing the tip volume over the inter-tip period is indeed sufficient to considerably improve the measurement accuracy, especially at low to medium intensities and a fine sampling resolution. The influence of the correction at high rainfall intensity increases with decreasing sampling resolution. Although the proposed smoothing algorithm provides further improvements at low intensities for gauges characterized by coarse sampling resolution, where the first algorithm is less effective, the results are still affected by a significant spread of deviation...|$|E
40|$|Measuring {{leachate}} mobility in the vadose zone {{is necessary}} to understand the processes controlling groundwater and river contamination, and requires recording leachate volumes with time. Many field studies manually measure the volume of leachate with a daily, weekly, or even biweekly resolution; however, measurement of leachate at higher temporal resolution is needed for the calibration of solute transport models and is useful in identifying the contribution of preferential flow to solute transport. We designed a simple, robust, and low-cost <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> for measuring leachate volumes at a high temporal resolution. Laboratory experiments showed a nearly perfect linear relationship between the applied flux {{and the number of}} drops per unit time, and indicate an average drop size of 35 mu L. Due to manual manufacturing, variability between drop counters is not negligible and a one-point calibration is necessary. The <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> consists of an upper (guiding) tube from which a drop forms and a lower (capillary) tube that "sucks" the drop down before it falls. The presence of the lower tube makes the counter less vulnerable to temperature and ionic strength effects of the leachate. Counting of the drops can be easily achieved using any type of datalogger capable of logging electrical pulses. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{estimation}} of soil hydraulic {{properties in the}} vadose zone has some issues, such as accuracy, acquisition time, and cost. In this study, an inexpensive automated test column (ATC) was developed to characterize water flow in a homogeneous unsaturated porous medium by the simultaneous {{estimation of}} three hydraulic state variables: water content, matric potential, and water flow rates. The ATC includes five electrical resistance probes, two minitensiometers, and a <b>drop</b> <b>counter,</b> which were tested with infiltration tests using the Hydrus- 1 D model. The results show that calibrations of electrical resistance probes reasonably match with similar studies, and the maximum error of calibration of the tensiometers was 4. 6 % {{with respect to the}} full range. Data measured by the <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> installed in the ATC exhibited a high consistency with the electrical resistance probes, which provides an independent verification of the model and indicates an evaluation of the water mass balance. The study results show good performance of the model against the infiltration tests, which suggests a robustness of the methodology developed in this study. An extension to the applicability of this system could be successfully used in low-budget projects in large-scale field experiments, which may be correlated with resistivity changes...|$|E

40|$|Summary. Two {{methods are}} {{described}} for {{the measurement of}} uterine blood flow in the pregnant rabbit. The first {{involves the use of}} a Parks ultrasonic Doppler probe placed over the exposed uterine artery. The second method uses a <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> system connected between the uterine and jugular veins. The Doppler flowmeter was used to measure uterine arterial blood flow in twenty rabbits on Day 28 or 29 of preg-nancy. No significant difference was observed between blood flow on these 2 days and the absolute blood flow to one horn (=+-. E.) was found to be 16 =. =+-=. ml/min, equivalent to 27 =. =+-=. ml/ 100 g tissue/min. Using the drop recorder technique, the flow to one uterine horn in eleven rabbits on Day 27 or 28 of pregnancy was 12 =. =+-=. ml/min, equivalent to 23 =. =+-=. ml/ 100 g tissue/min. The pressure-flow relation-ship in the uterine vascular bed was studied using the Doppler flow-meter and graded mechanical occlusion of the arterial supply. Within the range of pressures studied, the flow was found to be linearly related to the arterio-venous pressure difference. This suggests that the uterine vascular bed was fully dilated under the conditions of study...|$|E
40|$|A 6. 4 kHz Doppler sodar {{has been}} used in a {{feasibility}} study to retrieve rain rate and drop size distribution from sodar Doppler spectra. For rain rates above about 0. 5 mm/h raindrop and turbulence spectra can be separated, thus allowing a drop size distribution measurement in the Prandtl layer without assumptions on the size distribution type for drop diameters above 1 mm. The noise of the sodar used mostly forced us to 10 min averages for the rather light rain episodes (< mm/h rain rate) we have enountered in January 1993 at our experimental site in Northern Germany. In order to arrive at consistent rain parameter retrievals we have corrected both the mean vertical wind influence and the drop size dependent reaction to turbulent motion. The comparison to a <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> at the site gives good results only for the periods with rain rates above 1 mm/h at the absence of drizzle. Assuming a height independent rain rate in the Prandtl layer even gives the possibility for a near surface temperature profile retrieval. For higher sodar frequencies above 15 kHz a clearer separation of turbulence and rainspectra would lower the threshold drop size and thus improve rain parameter retrievals but be more strongly dependent on the near surface temperature and humidity profiles.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of any single uncertainty {{factor in the}} resulting performance of infield rain gauge measurements {{still has to be}} comprehensively assessed due to the high number of real world error sources involved, such as the intrinsic variability of rainfall intensity (RI), wind effects, wetting losses, the ambient temperature, etc. In recent years the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) addressed these issues by fostering dedicated investigations, which revealed further difficulties in assessing the actual reference rainfall intensity in the field. This work reports on an extensive assessment of the OTT Pluvio 2 weighing gauge accuracy when measuring rainfall intensity under laboratory dynamic conditions (time varying reference flow rates). The results obtained from the weighing rain gauge (WG) were also compared with a MTX tipping-bucket rain gauge (TBR) under the same test conditions. Tests were carried out by simulating various artificial precipitation events, with unsteady rainfall intensity, using a suitable dynamic rainfall generator. Real world rainfall data measured by an Ogawa catching-type <b>drop</b> <b>counter</b> at a field test site located within the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) were used as a reference for the artificial rain generation system. Results demonstrate that the differences observed between the laboratory and field performance of catching-type gauges are only partially attributable to the weather and operational conditions in the field. The dynamics of real world precipitation events is responsible for {{a large part of the}} measurement errors, which can be accurately assessed in the laboratory under controlled environmental conditions.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the movement of water and solutes in soils, {{and the risk of}} groundwater contamination, we need water and solute flux observations distributed in space and time. We designed a new variable-suction multicompartment percolation sampler that can be buried below an undisturbed soil volume in the field. The instrument collects percolate from 100 cells within a 32. 5 - by 32. 5 -cm area. <b>Drop</b> <b>counters</b> record the number of drops falling into the sample collectors of all cells. The cells are covered by a porous material to which suction is applied in accordance with nearby tensiometer readings. The collected water can be repeatedly extracted in situ, allowing the breakthrough curve of each cell to be measured. This temporal and spatial resolution greatly helps to quantify heterogeneous flow at scales between that of the individual sampling cell and the entire sampler. Three prototypes were tested in different laboratory (under a soil monolith) and field experiments (buried in situ) in Australia and the Netherlands. One sampler was covered with a nylon mesh, another with sintered porous stainless steel plates, and a third with a polyamide membrane. Water was uniformly applied at the soil surface by irrigation (laboratory) or natural rainfall (field). Suction could be controlled once the covers were saturated, blocking the inflow of air. The instruments operated continuously for several months. The membrane and metal covers worked best. The wealth of data obtained from a single experiment provides considerable insight in water and solute transport processes in undisturbed soil...|$|R
