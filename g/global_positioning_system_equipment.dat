Consequently ‘the map’ has become increasingly rich, but the quality of the data is very often questioned and comes under scrutiny from the GIS and LBS (Location-Based Services) communities. By examining the world map generated from OpenStreetMap, it is relatively easy to identify areas which are more or less well supported in community mapping activities; a very high level of spatial detail in certain areas can indicate the quality of OSM data. MVP OSM is a software tool designed to highlight areas in OpensStreetMap where users (contributors) are dedicated to providing high levels of spatial detail. This usually correlates {{with the use of a}} GPS and on-the-ground mapping, or, at the very least, a deep local knowledge of the area and an inherent desire to see it represented in the highest level of detail on OpenStreetMap. The input to MVP OSM is an OSM XML file, which is converted by Python into a file for spatialite (the GIS extension for sqlite). Within spatialite the data is processed to create clusters and using these spatial clusters, the tool can then derive the activity of single or multiple users in that area. Vector layers and heatmaps are generated as output that can be overlaid onto OSM maps. A high level of detail can be considered a good indicator of the quality of OSM data within a given area. The MVP OSM tool hides the details of OSM XML processing, which many researchers find difficult, and processes the data to produce very useful visualizations of contributor activity in any given OSM area...|$|E

Study design: Prospective observational study. Animals: A total of 989 Nordic breed endurance sled dogs that participated in the 2011 Iditarod Sled Dog Race. Data were collected via an extensive questionnaire, medical records, and speed calculations based on <b>Global</b> <b>Positioning</b> <b>System</b> <b>equipment</b> on each dog sled. OI risk factors and DD incidence were statistically analyzed on dogs and teams completing {{at least half the}} race distance, including Student’s t-test, Pearson’s chi-squared test, Poisson regression, and various frailty analysis models as indicated. Significance was set at P< 0. 10 for inclusion in the models with trends established at P≤ 0. 10 and significance declared at P< 0. 05. Results: Questionnaire response was 40. 3 %. DD incidence was 38. 3 %, most often due to OI (50. 6 %). OI occurred most frequently in the thoracic limb (43. 3 %) compared with pelvic limb injuries (7. 3 %). Increased speed was associated with fewer shoulder injuries (Ratio= 0. 65, P= 0. 03). Carpal injuries were positively related with increased conditioning distance (defined as training miles; Hazard ratio = 1. 61, P= 0. 02). The risk to become a DD decreased with every year of increased age of the dogs (Hazard ratio = 0. 92, P= 0. 03). Conclusion: OI, specifically of the shoulder and carpus, are common in marathon sled dogs. Injury risk may be speed-related and decreases with increasing age of the dog.

40|$|Abstract—The {{unmanned}} {{control of}} the steering wheel is, at present, {{one of the most}} important challenges facing researchers in autonomous vehicles within the field of intelligent transportation systems (ITSs). In this paper, we present a two-layer control architecture for automatically moving the steering wheel of a mass-produced vehicle. The first layer is designed to calculate the target position of the steering wheel at any time and is based on fuzzy logic. The second is a classic control layer that moves the steering bar by means of an actuator to achieve the position targeted by the first layer. Real-time kinematic differential <b>global</b> <b>positioning</b> <b>system</b> (RTK-DGPS) <b>equipment</b> is the main sensor input for positioning. It is accurate to about 1 cm and can finely locate the vehicle trajectory. The developed systems are installed on a Citroën Berlingo van, which is used as a testbed vehicle. Once this control architecture has been implemented, installed, and tuned, the resulting steering maneuvering is very similar to human driving, and the trajectory errors from the reference route are reduced to a minimum. The experimental results show that the combination of GPS and artificial-intelligence-based techniques behaves outstandingly. We can also draw other important con-clusions regarding the design of a control system derived from human driving experience, providing an alternative mathematical formalism for computation, human reasoning, and integration of qualitative and quantitative information.

Result shows that before the movement of the slope, data obtained from resistivity log shows a uniform signature, while after or during sliding, the resistivity signature changed. The change was due {{to the development of a}} slip surface within the landslide mass...|$|R
40|$|Landslide is a {{phenomenon}} of mass movement of terrain. In order to prevent landslide, understanding {{the behavior of the}} landslide is important. The behavior of the landslide is usually measured by extensometer, inclinometer or GPS (<b>global</b> <b>positioning</b> <b>system).</b> These <b>equipments</b> are measuring some points or along the lines; it is difficult to measure the whole landslide area. Currently, it is expected that ground based LiDAR can be used to monitor the whole landslide area, because the LiDAR can acquire threedimensional data of wide area in a short time. The acquired time series data should be analyzed to measure the land movement to understand the behaviour of the landslide. Author report the method of landslide measurement with a LiDAR based on the best past results of the research. For accurate measurement, surface of flat plane should be used. At least 256 points or more points are used in surface measurement, the error margin produced less than 1 cm. When, the object surface is small, repeat measurement will be effective. Next, materials or GCP were evaluated. The result showed reflector sheets had accurate than the prism. Acquisition of the vicinity of the center of coordinates in the method used the averaging weight of reflection strength in selection of GCP. When the position of the LiDAR was setup on a fixed place, the transformation model must be fit to the situation and it is established. Method of the object matching for landslide monitoring is developed using these data, and the displacement extraction of the landslide will be able to present in future. 1. 1.
