40|$|PurposeWilliams-Beuren {{syndrome}} (WBS) {{is caused}} by a hemizygous microdeletion of chromosome 7 q 11. 23 and is characterized by global cognitive impairment, dysmorphic facial features, and supravalvular aortic stenosis. <b>Endocrine</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> have been reported in patients with WBS. This study was performed to investigate the frequency, clinical features, and outcomes of <b>endocrine</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> in children with WBS. MethodsOne hundred two patients were included. The diagnosis was confirmed by chromosome analysis and fluorescent in situ hybridization. Medical charts were reviewed retrospectively to analyze <b>endocrine</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> such as short stature, precocious puberty, thyroid dysfunctions, and hypocalcemia. ResultsThe age at diagnosis was 3. 7 ± 4. 4 years (one month to 19 years). Height- and weight-standard deviation score (SDS) were – 1. 1 ± 1. 1 and – 1. 4 ± 1. 4 at presentation, respectively. Short stature was found in 26 patients (28. 3 %) among those older than 2 years. Body mass index-SDS increased as the patients grew older (P< 0. 001). Two males and one female (2. 9 %) were diagnosed with central precocious puberty. Nine patients (8. 8 %) were diagnosed with primary hypothyroidism at age 4. 0 ± 4. 3 years (one month to 12. 1 years); their serum thyroid stimulating hormone and free T 4 levels were 15. 2 ± 5. 4 µU/mL and 1. 2 ± 0. 2 ng/dL, respectively. Hypercalcemia was observed in 12 out of 55 patients under age 3 (22 %) at the age of 14. 3 ± 6. 6 months (7 to 28 months) with a mean serum calcium level of 13. 1 ± 2. 1 mg/dL. ConclusionEndocrine dysfunctions are not uncommon causes of morbidity in patients with WBS. The severity and outcomes of their endocrine manifestations were heterogeneous.

40|$|Background: Many {{pediatric}} {{cancer survivors}} have endocrine conditions. After treatment with alkylating agents, steroids, methotrexate, and radiation, several <b>endocrine</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> may appear. Surveillance for late effects is recommended by guidelines worldwide. Objective: The {{objective of this}} study was to describe the endocrine outcomes of 764 patients followed during a 20 years’ period in our out-patient clinic. Design: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records. Patients: The study included 764 patients whose oncological or hematological dangerous diseases appeared before they were 18 years old. Larger groups were constituted by leukemias, central nervous tumors, and lymphomas. Outcome Measures: The frequency and types of endocrine conditions were analyzed. Results: 1, 091 endocrine conditions were observed in all groups. The most common types of endocrine conditions were problems with growth and the thyroid. We found puberty abnormalities and bone problems in third and fourth places of frequency. ACTH insufficiency was found in seventh place. Conclusion: <b>Endocrine</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> are very common in survivor populations. Endocrinologists should be aware of international guidelines and make an effort to optimize screening and treatment of endocrine effects of cancer therapy.

40|$|Human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectionis {{associated}} {{with a variety of}} endocrine problems. Hypoadrenalism, hypothyroidism and hypogonadism are commonly found singly or in combination. Especially, male hypogonadism is very common in this population and may lead to weight loss, lethargy and other co morbidities. We undertook this cross sectional observational study to evaluate endocrine profile in HIV infected males in a sample Eastern Indian population. We also studied for any correlation of the <b>endocrine</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> with their immune status. We studied the blood hormone profiles along with blood CD 4 counts. The bloods were drawn in fasting state and analysed using suitable high sensitivity assays. Standard statistical methods were used. We had 48 patients in our study. Among them, 33 % had hypogonadism, 20 % had hypothyroidism and 15 patients had diabetes. The hypogonadism was mainly hypogonadotropic. In other studies across the globe also, hypogonadism in HIV positive males is found to be significant. Our diabetic patients were not on protease inhibitors. We found some patients who had multiple <b>endocrine</b> <b>dysfunctions.</b> HIV infection is often {{associated with}} endocrine abnormalities.

50|$|Pituicytoma {{is a rare}} brain tumor. It grows at {{the base}} of the brain from the {{pituitary}} gland. This tumor is thought to be derived from the parenchymal cells of the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland, called pituicytes. Some researchers believe that they arise from the folliculostellate cells in the anterior lobe of the pituitary. As such, it is a low-grade glioma. It occurs in adults and symptoms include visual disturbance and <b>endocrine</b> <b>dysfunction.</b> They are often mistaken for pituitary adenomas which have a similar presentation and occur in the same location. The treatment consists of surgical resection, which is curative in most cases.|$|E

Standard treatment includes maximal safe surgical debulking and adjuvant radiotherapy, with chemotherapy for high grade glioma. Better results of glioma therapies with treatments in recent years make these side effects more visible (Stupp et al. 2009).

5000|$|Other common {{diseases}} {{that result from}} <b>endocrine</b> <b>dysfunction</b> include Addison’s disease, Cushing’s disease and Grave’s disease. Cushing's disease and Addison's disease are pathologies involving the dysfunction of the adrenal gland. Dysfunction in the adrenal gland {{could be due to}} primary or secondary factors and can result in hypercortisolism or hypocortisolism [...] Cushing’s disease is characterized by the hypersecretion of the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) due to a pituitary adenoma that ultimately causes endogenous hypercortisolism by stimulating the adrenal glands. Some clinical signs of Cushing’s disease include obesity, moon face, and hirsutism. Addison's disease is an endocrine disease that results from hypocortisolism caused by adrenal gland insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency is significant because it is correlated with decreased ability to maintain blood pressure and blood sugar, a defect that can prove to be fatal.|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Frequent {{endocrine}} disorders {{have been}} reported after allogeneic stem-cell transplant, but data on adult survivors of autologous transplants are still scarce. METHODS: In this prospective study we investigated early (at 3 months) and late (at 12 months) <b>endocrine</b> <b>dysfunctions</b> in 95 consecutive autologous stem-cell transplant recipients (47 men and 48 women) aged 16 to 55 years. The functions of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal/thyroid/adrenal/somatotroph axis were evaluated. RESULTS: Three months after the transplant, insulin-like growth factor- 1 values were below the normal range in 53 patients (56 %); 37 of 40 women (93 %) of reproductive age experienced precocious ovarian failure; 39 of 46 men (85 %) showed high follicular stimulating hormone, and 17 men (37 %) showed low testosterone levels. Adrenal insufficiency occurred in 28 patients (30 %) during the peritransplant period after corticosteroid withdrawal. Transient subclinical hyperthyroidism was found in 15 patients (16 %). Transient "low T(3) " syndrome was revealed in 29 patients (31 %). Twelve months after the transplant, insulin-like growth factor- 1 values were still low in 36 patients (38 %). Menstrual cycles resumed in four women; follicular stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and estradiol levels improved in 10 patients. Testosterone was low in only two men (4 %). Seminal analysis revealed azoospermia in 32 (91 %) of 35 men examined. Subclinical hypothyroidism was found in 11 patients (12 %); eight of them had previously received radiotherapy for {{the upper half of}} the body. CONCLUSION: This study documents frequent endocrine disorders during the first year after autologous stem-cell transplant. Despite a tendency to improve, in {{more than half of the}} cases, the complications persisted for more than 1 year.
