A ruling in May 2005, by a United States courts of appeals held that the FCC lacked authority to impose it on the TV industry in the US. It required that all HDTVs obey a stream specification determining whether a stream can be recorded. This could block instances of fair use, such as time-shifting. It achieved more success elsewhere when it was adopted by the <b>Digital</b> <b>Video</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> Project (DVB), a consortium of about 250 broadcasters, manufacturers, network operators, software developers, and regulatory bodies from about 35 countries involved in attempting to develop new digital TV standards.|$|E

In this paper, the integrated Internet and DVB-T network is proposed to provide broadband Internet access services for users with high mobility. In order to make effective use of valuable DVB-T resources, we present a bandwidth allocation algorithm SOBAM(Satisfaction Oriented Bandwidth Allocation Method), {{which is based on}} a new concept: user satisfaction. The simulation results powerfully show that SOBAM gives good QoS differentiation and make plentiful utilization of DVB-T available bandwidth. With SOBAM, the integrated Internet and DVB-T network can provide a soft system capacity which is similar to the one in CDMA networks...|$|R

30|$|The LTE design {{presents}} radical differences {{at every}} layer. Like many other communication technologies (e.g., <b>digital</b> <b>video</b> and audio <b>broadcasting,</b> DSL, wireless LANs), the physical layer uses OFDM waveforms {{in order to}} avoid the intersymbol interference that typically arises in high bandwidth systems. In terms of radio access, CDMA has given away to time and frequency multiple access. One differentiating aspect of the LTE standard is that from the onset, MIMO is an integral component, and not an add-on feature. At the network layer, a flatter architecture is being defined that represents the transition from the existing UTRA network, which combines circuit- and packet-switching, to an all-IP system.|$|R

30|$|Due to {{its high}} data rate {{transmission}} capability and its robustness to multipath delay spread, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) has been adopted {{in most parts of}} modern wireless communication systems, such as wireless local area networks [1], <b>digital</b> audio and <b>video</b> <b>broadcasting</b> [2], and so is OFDM being standardized for the future wireless communication systems, such as Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access [3] and 3 GPP’s Long-Term Evolution [4]. However, OFDM is known to be very sensitive to radio frequency front-end imperfections such as carrier frequency offset (CFO), in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) imbalance and phase noise. These imperfections, if not properly estimated and compensated, will severely degrade the performance of OFDM systems. CFO and IQ imbalance are constant over an OFDM symbol period and have widely been investigated and well solved in the literature [5 – 8]. However, unlike the constant CFO and IQ imbalance, phase noise is a stochastic process during an OFDM symbol period and therefore causes a greater challenging problem. This is because each OFDM sample in an OFDM symbol period suffers from different phase noise.|$|R

On the other hand, with high-speed railway construction worldwide, the moving speed of high-speed train has been reported to be able to operate as high as more than 400 km/h, or, even higher on-board high-speed vehicles such as aircraft. Consequently, mobility support is widely {{regarded as one of the}} key features in the above-mentioned OFDM systems. Meanwhile, for coherent detection in a wireless communication system, channel state information is indispensable. Therefore, to ensure effective communication of OFDM systems operating in high speed scenarios or alternatively very fast time-varying wireless channels, channel estimation method applicable to such high-speed environments has remained largely an open issue.|$|R

Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a powerful technique for high data-rate transmission over fading channels. However, to deploy OFDM in a WLAN environment, precise frequency synchronization must be maintained and tricky frequency offsets must be handled. In this thesis, various techniques to improve the data throughput of OFDM WLAN are investigated. A simulation tool was developed in Matlab to evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802. 11 a physical layer. We proposed a rapid time and frequency synchronization algorithm using only the short training sequence of the IEEE 802. 11 a standard, thus reducing the training overhead to 50 %. Particular attention was paid to channel coding, block interleaving and antenna diversity. Computer simulation showed that drastic improvement in error rate performance is achievable when these techniques are deployed. Lieutenant, Hellenic Nav...|$|R
