40|$|Both rainfed and {{irrigated}} soybean production {{are important}} in Nebraska (western US Corn Belt), accounting for a respective 48 and 52 % of the state’s soybean production of 7 Mt on a respective 55 and 45 % share of the state soybean area of 1. 9 Mha. To date, no assessment of factors that may account for regional and inter-annual variation in yield and irrigation amount has been performed. To accomplish that objective, we evaluated a database containing on-farm field yields and total irrigation amount used in those fields. These data have been collected annually from ca. 1000 soybean fields in six regions of Nebraska during the past eight years. Distributions of farm yield and irrigation amount were analyzed {{and the impact of}} selected weather variables and key management factors on these two variables was assessed. For irrigated soybean, attainable yields were estimated from the 95 th percentile of the yield distribution, and yield gaps were then calculated as the difference between the attainable yield and average farm yield. The interquartile range for yield and irrigation amount was used as a measure of the management gap between skillfully and sub-optimally managed fields. Distribution of <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> and irrigation amount were skewed, indicating that many producers achieved yields relatively close to the attainable yield, but also that irrigation in excess of the amount needed may have occurred in an important fraction of the total fields. Variation in rainfed yield was strongly related to July–August total rainfall and seasonal water deficit, but, in contrast, no single meteorological factor could consistently explain variation in <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield.</b> In fact, sowing date explained most of the observed inter-annual variation in <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> in all regions. Amount of irrigation applied in each year depended on both rainfall and reference evapotranspiration. Efficiency in use of irrigation water versus rainfall to produce seed yield was remarkably similar. Across regions, attainable yield of irrigated soybean in NE averaged 4. 7 Mg ha− 1, with the yield gap averaging about 16 % of the attainable yield. Variation in yield and irrigation amount among fields was more important than variation among years and even regions. Further research is needed to identify the causes for this observed field-to-field variation in yield and irrigation amount within the same year and region...|$|E

Net radiation above and within {{a canopy of}} sweet corn (Zea rnays L., vat. Silver Queen) was monitored uring early and late stages of growth in separate plots of the same field. The radiation sensors were mounted on automated reversing carriages which were mounted either at 25 or at 300 cm above ground level. The mounted sensors traversed a 3. 3 m span to achieve spatial averaging. Output voltages of each radiation sensor was continuously integrated and recorded at hourly intervals. Early and late plant water stresses were induced by inadequate rainfall {{and the use of}} automatic rainfall shelters, respectively. Plant height and leaf area were measured in a plant population of 67 750 plant ha- 1. Early drought delayed canopy development while in the late drought reatment the canopy was nearly developed before late drought was imposed. When nonstressed plants were fully developed, net radiation 25 cm above the soil surface was 32 % of the above-canopy net radiation. As leaves wilted during early drought, net radiation, at 25 cm above the soil surface, increased from 32 to 46 % of that measured above the canopy and increased to 51 % due to late drought. The observed net radiation differences were induced by im-posed plant water stresses which also had the effect of reducing fresh ear yield by 25 to 45 % of the <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> for early and late-stressed treatments, respectively...|$|E

Corn was grown in crop rotations with dryland, limited irrigation, or full irrigation management from 1985 to 1999. Crop rotations included corn following corn (continuous corn), corn following wheat, followed by soybean (wheat-corn-soybean), and corn following soybean (corn-soybean).

The crop is grown in different seasons in a year with varying exposure to weather extremes, including high temperatures at critical growth stages which are expected to increase with climate change. This study assesses the impact of current and future heat stress on maize and the benefit of heat-tolerant varieties in SA. Annual mean maximum temperatures may increase by 1. 4 – 1. 8 °C in 2030 and 2. 1 – 2. 6 °C in 2050, with large monthly, seasonal, and spatial variations across SA. The extent of heat stressed areas in SA could increase by up to 12 % in 2030 and 21 % in 2050 relative to the baseline. The impact of heat stress and the benefit from heat-tolerant varieties vary {{with the level of}} temperature increase and planting season. At a regional scale, climate change would reduce rainfed maize yield by an average of 3. 3 – 6. 4 % in 2030 and 5. 2 – 12. 2 % in 2050 and <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> by 3 – 8 % in 2030 and 5 – 14 % in 2050 if current varieties were grown under the future climate.

Heat-tolerant maize varieties, therefore, have the potential to shield maize farmers from severe yield loss due to heat stress and help them adapt to climate change impacts.

Greater crop production {{will be required}} to support both an increase in biofuel use and a forecasted doubling of global food demand by 2050. An improved understanding of yield potential and realistic estimates of the magnitude and spatial variability of the gap between actual yield and yield potentials are critical to achieving maximum crop production. This study examines near-term yield potentials and gaps of maize (Zea mays L.) yield data over the years of 2006 to 2011 from two sources: university crop variety trials and the United States Department of Agriculture yield surveys. Yield potentials are analyzed across 32 states through a compiled database of 129, 499 trial maize hybrid entries. From the database, 1, 102 direct, irrigation-specific, year-to-year, county-to-county yield comparisons are made across 27 states. These 32 and 27 states comprise nearly all United States maize production— 99 % and 97 %, respectively. Trial yield is calculated as the 90 th percentile of hybrid yields in a given county in a given year, and farm yield is the USDA-reported county-level yield in that same trial-performing county in that same year. Analysis of the median yield gap values in each state shows a yield gap of 13 % to 53 % in rainfed maize and a yield gap of 16 % to 39 % in irrigated maize. The magnitude of these differences between farming and trial yields indicates that maize yields in the United States, particularly rainfed, have considerable room for improvement. Additionally, the 40 % range of median rainfed yield gap values and the 23 % range of median <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> gap values suggest that the yield gap varies greatly between states. The results of this study are expected to support the production of more accurate biofuel crop projections and identify where yields might be increased, thereby avoiding further land conversion to cropland while reaching the goal of increasing biofuel production and sustaining ample food production...|$|E
40|$|The {{magnitude}} of crop {{production per unit}} area has increased in the US in the last 50 years due to the green revolution (Femandez-Comejo, 2004). Yet, even with these increases, there is still variability in crop yield that is present in modem, intensive agricultural systems (Porter and Semenov, 2005). This variability has a negative effect on food security which depends on a minimum amount of food being available at a given point in time. By definition, food cannot be secure unless it is guaranteed to a certain level (Maxwell, 1996). Hence, an understanding of crop yield variability is essential to the question of food security. Using a linear mixed effects analysis for a particular US state and a particular crop, environmental factors that affect variability were shown, in both irrigated and rainfed crop situations to explain over 80 % of yield variance. The variance was linked to two major factors: daily air temperature and soil moisture. For rainfed yield, temperature effects explained 40 % of the yield variance while soil moisture explained 43 % of yield variance. For <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> temperature effects explained 87 % of the yield variance. The results suggest that yield variance occurs from variation in the season averages, and in specific points in the growing season, for the major factors highlighted. This assessment is confirmed by moisture and temperature sensitivity characteristics of the crop in question. It is shown by exploratory, time series, and spatial analysis that low yield observations have contrasts in growing season conditions both during key crop reproduction periods and over the entire season. Herein it is argued that variation in temperature effects and moisture have the highest effect on crop yield particularly when they occur during the reproductive phase of the plant. by Gabriel T.

A study was therefore implemented {{to investigate the}} impact of climate on cane productivity. The study was carried out on a sector basis. This paper reports the outcome for the West Sector, of which approximately 4000 ha are corporately managed, with nearly 90 % under irrigation. The locally validated sugarcane module of the Decision Support System for Agro-Technology Transfer (DSSAT) v 3. 5 was adopted to simulate the climatically determined yield for the period 1998 to 2007 at one site using the crop coefficient of variety R 570 grown in a 120 cm deep soil with a total available water content of 142 mm under both rainfed and non-limiting water conditions. A 12 -month ratoon harvested on 01 October was adopted as representative of the harvest season (July to November). Climatically determined cane yield (1998 - 2007) averaged 20 t/ha under rainfed conditions and 142 t/ha under fully irrigated conditions, with high correlation with solar radiation (r 2 = 0. 778) in the latter case.

These calculations have been done with both a simple growth model, SOYBEANW, and a comprehensive model, CROPGRO. Comparison of the results from the 2 models indicated the sort of climate change conditions in which model results differed and may become less reliable. The effectiveness of possible management responses to climate change and the uncertainty in the model results were also evaluated with both models. Both models calculated for the climate change scenarios at Oxford a strong increase in irrigated seed yield. For Montpellier and Seville, however, CROPGRO calculated a considerable increase in <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> for these scenarios, whereas SOYBEANW calculated only a slight increase. Without irrigation, the seed yield increase for the climate change scenarios was almost identical for the 2 models, i. e. considerable, slight and nil for Oxford, Montpellier and Seville, respectively. Changes in climatic variability did not result in a yield change at any site, both with and without irrigation and both for CROPGRO and SOYBEANW. With irrigation, the change in the coefficient of variation (CV) of seed yields by climate change was nil (except for decrease at Oxford) for both models and without irrigation, this change in CV was variable depending on site, climate change scenario and model. The management response analyses showed that the crop variety {{did not need to be}} changed in response to climate change, that the yield increase due to climate change was stronger for an advanced sowing date (but only without irrigation), and that irrigation requirements decreased with climate change only in the case of an early sowing date.

Comparison of the results from both models indicated the sort of climate change conditions in which model results differed and may become less reliable. The effectiveness of possible management responses to climate change and the uncertainty in the model results were also evaluated with both models. With both models, climate change in northern Europe resulted in moderate to strong tuber yield increases in Jokioinen, Finland, and Tylstrup, Denmark, and in almost no yield change in Oxford, UK, both with and without irrigation. NPOTATO calculated for climate change in central and southern Europe nil to slight decreases in <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> for the HCGG climate change scenario and nil to moderate yield increases for the HCGS scenario, and variable changes in water-limited yield for the HCGG scenario and slight to moderate yield increases for the HCGS scenario.

With both models, changes in climatic variability did not result in changes in both irrigated and water-limited yields in Europe.

40|$|Shober, AmyInefficient use of {{nitrogen}} (N) fertilizer in agronomic crop production {{can lead to}} water quality concerns and reduced yields for growers. Nitrogen left in the soil after crop harvest is subject to leaching losses to groundwater or gaseous losses to the atmosphere. Split additions of N via sidedressing or fertigation can better time N applications with corn N uptake and improve N use efficiency (NUE). Irrigation can also stabilize yields and raise NUE at decade time scales. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) quantify the effect of N rate and timing under central pivot irrigation on grain yield and N use efficiency in Delaware using a plot study and 2) investigate the impact of irrigation on yield and NUE in Delaware using historical yield data. A plot study was completed by establishing irrigated corn on well-drained soil which received zero N (control) or 6. 72 Mg ha- 1 poultry litter, 34 kg ha- 1 starter N at planting, and 0, 82, 140, or 198 kg ha- 1 of in-season N (applied at sidedress at V 5 or via fertigation at V 5, V 8, V 11, and V 13). Grain yield was determined for each treatment at harvest using a weigh wagon. Pre-plant soil, post-harvest grain, residue, and in-season soil samples were collected and analyzed to allow calculation of NUE by several methods. Nitrogen application rate affected yields and NUE more than N timing and application when in-season N was applied. Yields of irrigated corn were statistically similar at N rates exceeding 82 kg ha- 1; average yields over the study period were 17 Mg ha- 1. Partial factor productivity {{of nitrogen}} was above 60 kg kg- 1 for corn at all N rates except the highest rate. Total aboveground biomass for irrigated corn treatments receiving supplemental N generally contained more N in plant tissue (values ranged from 214 to 254 kg ha- 1) than Chesapeake Bay Model Scenario Builder (SB) maximum uptake estimates of 218 kg ha- 1. Mass balance estimates of NUE indicated that 13 to 49 % of available N applied to plots could not be unaccounted for in plant tissue or soils. The mass balance approach illustrated a trend for increasing unaccounted for N with increasing N rate but, this was only significant in 2014. Leachate concentrations of NO 3 -N at 60 cm depth were highest in plots receiving supplemental N, with mean concentrations of 7 and 22 mg L- 1 NO 3 -N in 2014 and 2015, respectively. Currently, irrigated land receives an interim credit of 4 % reduction in total N in the Chesapeake Bay Model. This reduction is modeled like a filter, where irrigated corn would release 4 % less N than comparable rainfed fields. Historical data from University of Delaware corn hybrid variety trials were analyzed to evaluate effects of irrigation on corn yields and NUE over time. Historical yield data and calculated NUE (from variety trials and UD field plot studies) were compared to values in the literature and those used by the Chesapeake Bay Program. In the last two decades, hybrid variety trials met and exceeded the 12. 5 Mg ha- 1 yield maximum value used in the Chesapeake Bay Model SB. Rainfed plots were 80 and 85 % as efficient as irrigated plots in converting applied N to grain yield over the 35 year history of UD corn variety trials. A scenario indicated that irrigated corn could consume 1, 030 Mg more N annually than rainfed plots if they were fertilized based on UD N rates for a realistic <b>irrigated</b> <b>yield</b> goal. Based on results of a two-year plot study at UD Warrington Irrigation Farm and analysis of 35 years of yield data from UD variety trials, we make the following preliminary recommendations: 1) lower UD N rate recommendations for high yielding irrigated corn by 15 % to account for increased NUE of irrigated corn and 2) Evaluate if irrigation’s NUE would be more appropriately modeled as a separate crop category or, as a BMP. Future research should focus providing data to further refine these recommendations by quantifying NUE at a regional scale. On-farm strip trials could be conducted by UD researchers with a common protocol at multiple locations to evaluate how NUE and yields are affected by irrigation and N management. In addition, we also recommend collection and analysis of leachate and groundwater samples as part of these strip trials to determine risk of N losses at different locations under various soil and management conditions.

The authors combined a retrospective and prospective analysis, an interdisciplinary approach, collaboration among climatologists, geographers, and sociologists, and the participation of local farmers and stakeholders, all contributing their own knowledge. This paper assesses the adaptability of olive-growing systems to climate irregularities over the past 50 yr. First, a climatic study shows that rainfall decreased by 18 % during the period 1955 – 2009. Water resource availability has declined 2 or 3 times more than rainfall, {{in part because of}} the expansion of irrigation, which ameliorated the effects of droughts and increased profitability. Second, relationships between rainfall and both irrigated and rainfed olive yields are assessed.

In 1956, each inch of water increased yield by 2. 7 bushels per acre up to the 60 -percent AMC level. Beyond this point, maintaining soil moisture at 90 percent or greater of field capacity reduced yield per increment of added water.

This breeding program was initiated to compare two selection environments {{and to improve}} the yield stability of tropical maize under the north Florida drought-prone environments. Rainfed and irrigated plots were used to evaluate 140 fullsib families, along with four checks in a 12 X 12 partially balanced lattice design with four replications. Relative grain yield, plant and ear height leaf area, flower delay, canopy temperature, tassel weight, and drought index were used to select the fullsibs for the recombination phase. Yield reductions, ranging from 2 to 40 % in the stress site, were mild due to appreciable rainfall. High variability existed among the fullsibs tested for grain <b>yield.</b> <b>Irrigated</b> grain <b>yield</b> ranged from 3987 to 8039 kg ha, and rainfed grain yield from 3066 to 7124 kg ha.

40|$|The Challenge The {{unimpeded}} {{growth of}} greenhouse gas emissions is raising the earth’s temperature. The consequences include melting glaciers, more precipitation, more and more extreme weather events, and shifting seasons. The accelerating pace of climate change, combined with global population and income growth, threatens food security everywhere. Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change. Higher temperatures eventually reduce yields of desirable crops while encouraging weed and pest proliferation. Changes in precipitation patterns {{increase the likelihood of}} short-run crop failures and long-run production declines. Although there will be gains in some crops in some regions of the world, the overall impacts of climate change on agriculture are expected to be negative, threatening global food security. Populations in the developing world, which are already vulnerable and food insecure, are likely to be the most seriously affected. In 2005, nearly half of the economically active population in developing countries— 2. 5 billion people—relied on agriculture for its livelihood. Today, 75 percent of the world’s poor live in rural areas. This Food Policy Report presents research results that quantify the climate-change impacts mentioned above, assesses the consequences for food security, and estimates the investments that would offset the negative consequences for human well-being. This analysis brings together, for the first time, detailed modeling of crop growth under climate change with insights from an extremely detailed global agriculture model, using two climate scenarios to simulate future climate. The results of the analysis suggest that agriculture and human well-being will be negatively affected by climate change: * In developing countries, climate change will cause yield declines for the most important crops. South Asia will be particularly hard hit. * Climate change will have varying effects on <b>irrigated</b> <b>yields</b> across regions, but <b>irrigated</b> <b>yields</b> for all crops in South Asia will experience large declines. * Climate change will result in additional price increases for the most important agricultural crops–rice, wheat, maize, and soybeans. Higher feed prices will result in higher meat prices. As a result, climate change will reduce the growth in meat consumption slightly and cause a more substantial fall in cereals consumption. * Calorie availability in 2050 will not only be lower than in the no–climate-change scenario—it will actually decline relative to 2000 levels throughout the developing world. * By 2050, the decline in calorie availability will increase child malnutrition by 20 percent relative to a world with no climate change. Climate change will eliminate much of the improvement in child malnourishment levels that would occur with no climate change. * Thus, aggressive agricultural productivity investments of US$ 7. 1 – 7. 3 billion are needed to raise calorie consumption enough to offset the negative impacts of climate change on {{the health and well-being of}} children.

40|$|A simulation/optimization {{model is}} {{developed}} for maximizing <b>irrigated</b> crop <b>yield</b> while avoiding unacceptable pesticide leaching. The optimization model {{is designed to}} help managers prevent non-point source contamination of shallow groundwater aquifers. It computes optimal irrigation amounts for given soil, crop, chemical, and weather data and irrigation frequencies. It directly computes the minimum <b>irrigated</b> crop <b>yield</b> reduction needed to prevent groundwater contamination. Constraint equations used in the model maintain a layered soil moisture volume balance; describe percolation, downward unsaturated zone solute transport and pesticide degradation; and limit the amount of pesticide reaching groundwater. Constraints are linear, piecewise linear, nonlinear, and exponential. The problem is solved using nonlinear programming optimization. The model is tested for different scenarios of irrigating corn. The modeling approach is promising as a tool to aid in the development of environmentally sound agricultural production practices. It allows direct estimation of trade-offs between crop production and groundwater protection for different management approaches. More frequent irrigation tends to give better crop yield and reduce solute movement. Trade-offs decrease with increasing irrigation frequency. More frequent irrigation reduces yield loss due to moisture stress and requires less water to fill the root zone to field capacity. This prevents the solute from moving to deeper soil layers. Yield-environmental quality trade-offs are smaller for deeper groundwater tables because deeper groundwater allows more time for chemical degradation...|$|R
40|$|Irrigator-Pro is {{an expert}} system that prescribes {{irrigation}} for corn (Zea mays L.), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) and peanut (Arachis hypogaea). We conducted an experiment in 2007 to evaluate Irrigator-Pro {{as a tool for}} variable rate irrigation of peanut using a site-specific center pivot irrigation system. Treatments were irrigation of whole plots based on the expert system, irrigation of individual soils within plots based on the expert system, irrigation of individual soils within plots based on tensiometers, and rainfed. Treatments were assigned to large plots with lengths that were 45 ° along the travel distance of the pivot and widths of 18. 3 m along its span. Experimental design was randomized complete block and there were four replicates of each treatment. In-season data collection from all plots included normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), canopy temperature, soil water potential, and cumulative water applied. Peanut yield was determined with a yield monitor. Irrigation applications began earlier in the season for plots managed with the expert system than for plots managed with tensiometers on all soils and total water applied was generally higher for both treatments using Irrigator Pro than for the tensiometer treatment. Rainfed yields were approximately 50 % of <b>irrigated</b> <b>yields.</b> There were no differences between the three irrigation scheduling methods treatments for NDVI, canopy temperature, or yield.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} of a two-year study comparing the evapotranspiration (ET), yields and the microclimate under drip and furrow irrigated processing tomatoes. Results from a water conservation standpoint were not encouraging with approximately equal values of evapotranspiration {{found for the}} two methods of irrigation. This was true in replicated field-plot studies {{as well as the}} lysimeter studies. The latter studies indicate that although ET under furrow irrigation was considerably higher than under drip irrigation for the three days following each furrow irrigation, this advantage largely canceled by a reversal in trends thereafter. Apparently the advection of sensible heat in air and soil to the narrow wet strips under the drip-irrigated canopy produces quite significant evaporation losses in spite of a nearly zerio under-canopy net radiation. Yield of ripe fruit in the drip <b>irrigated</b> lysimeter exceeded <b>yields</b> in the furrow lysimeter by 9 % and 16 % respectively in 1979 and 1980.

40|$|Efficiently {{controlling}} {{soil water}} content with irrigation {{is essential for}} water conservation and often improves potato yield. Volumetric soil water content ([theta]v) in relation to irrigation, plant uptake, and yield in potato hills and replicated plots was studied to evaluate four water management options. Measurements of [theta]v using a hammer driven probe were used to derive a [theta]v index representing the relative [theta]v status of replicated plots positioned along a hill slope. Time series for [theta]v were determined using time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes at 5 and 15  cm depths at the center, shoulder, and furrow locations in potato hills. Sap flow was determined using flow collars in replicated field plots for four treatments: un-irrigated, sprinkler, surface drip, and sub-surface drip irrigation (40  cm depth). <b>Irrigated</b> <b>yields</b> were high/low as the [theta]v index was low/high suggesting [theta]v excess was a production problem in the wetter portions of the study area. The diurnal pattern of sap flow {{was reflected in the}} [theta]v fluctuation it induces at hill locations with appreciable uptake. Hill locations with higher plant uptake were drier as was the case for the 5  cm (dry) depth relative to the 15  cm (wet) depth and for locations in the hill (dry) relative to the furrow (wet). The surface drip system had the lowest water use requirement because it delivers water directly to the hill locations where uptake is greatest. The sub-surface drip system wetted the hill gradually (1 - 2 days). Measurement of the [theta]v index prior to experimental establishment could improve future experimental design for treatment comparisons. ...|$|R

Simulated results of mustard model showed a spatial variation in yield among all five regions in both irrigated and rainfed mustard. Under <b>irrigated</b> conditions, the <b>yield</b> reduction in 2020, 2050 and 2080 would be highest in Eastern-IGP (Indo-Gangetic Plain) region followed by Central-IGP. This was due to maximum projected rise in temperature in Eastern-IGP where maximum and minimum temperature would rise by 5. 1 ° and 5. 6 °C in 2080. The reduction of <b>irrigated</b> mustard <b>yield</b> was least in Northern-IGP under almost all scenarios. But in western India, yield reduction gradually increased from 2020 to 2080. In future climate change scenarios, the rainfall would be projected to increase in 2050 irrespective of the locations. But in 2020 and 2080 rainfall would reduce in Northern-IGP, Western and Central India. This was reflected higher yield reduction in rainfed mustard in these three locations. In sorghum, the future climate change scenario analysis showed that the yields (CSH 16 and CSV 15) are likely to reduce at Akola, Anantpur, Coimbatore and Bijapur.

Eight ESD and two SD genotypes were sown on two dates in April and May, with and without supplementary irrigation. In addition, pigeonpea ESD genotype ICPL 88039, and SD genotype ICPL 86012, sesame (Sesamum indicum cv. M. I. 3), blackgram (Vigna mungo cv. M. I. 1) were compared under rainfed zero-tillage conditions after a rice crop at two locations in 1996. Seed yields of the pigeonpea genotypes under rainfed conditions ranged from 0. 07 to 0. 47 t ha- 1 in the early sowings and 0. 09 to 0. 42 t ha- 1 in the late sowings. The <b>irrigated</b> <b>yields</b> reached 1. 7 t ha- 1 in early sowing and 1. 3 t ha- 1 in the late sowings. Irrigation differentially influenced the performance of pigeonpea genotypes in both the sowings in 1996. Analysis of pooled data showed highly significant genotype × environment (year-sowing-irrigation combination) interactions. The interaction pattern among genotypes was associated with differences in {{the length of the}} reproductive period and the partitioning coefficient of genotypes. ICPL 88039, with the shortest reproductive period {{and one of the best}} in partitioning efficiency, recorded maximum mean yield. As a rainfed post-rice crop in farmers' fields, ICPL 88039 yielded 0. 43 - 1. 4 t ha- 1 which exceeded yields of SD pigeonpea (0. 02 - 0. 88 t ha- 1), blackgram (Vigna mungo) (0. 03 - 1. 00 t ha- 1) and sesame (0 - 0. 09 t ha- 1).
