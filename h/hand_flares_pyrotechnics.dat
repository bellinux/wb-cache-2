50|$|As {{demand for}} weapons and {{ammunition}} declined {{with the end}} of the war, many Royal Ordnance Factories were closed. ROF Glascoed was retained and supplemented its output by manufacturing concrete building products and by scrapping surplus munitions. The growing hostility of the Cold War as evidenced by the Korean War saw a much wider range of munitions filled, assembled and packed at ROF Glascoed. These included munitions for field guns and howitzers, tanks and other fighting vehicles, mortar and aerial bombs, warheads for missiles and torpedoes, <b>flares,</b> <b>pyrotechnics</b> and smoke bombs.|$|R

50|$|In {{forest and}} prairie management, the driptorch {{is the most}} common tool used to ignite {{prescribed}} burns, which are used to remove excess fuel buildup or to re-create natural cycles of fire in an ecosystem. Other tools which can also be used for this purpose include the fusee, a pyrotechnic device similar to a road <b>flare,</b> other <b>pyrotechnic</b> devices, or even shovelfulls of burning vegetative fuels thrown from one place to another.|$|R
50|$|A modern {{illumination}} shell has a {{time fuze}} that ejects a flare 'package' through {{the base of}} the carrier shell at a standard height above ground (typically about 600 metres), from where it slowly falls beneath a non-flammable parachute, illuminating the area below. The ejection process also initiates a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flare</b> emitting white or 'black' infrared light.|$|R
50|$|Walt Disney {{requested}} a fireworks show {{against the backdrop}} of Sleeping Beauty Castle at Disneyland in 1958, to keep guests at the park for longer hours and provide much needed night-time entertainment. Early shows were performed by having cast members manually launch <b>hand</b> <b>flares.</b> The show was extremely popular, and became a vital component of the Disneyland experience. When the second Disney park, the Magic Kingdom, opened in Florida in 1971, it was only natural to duplicate the show there. The predecessors to Walt Disney Creative Entertainment, the company who create all the entertainment for Disney parks worldwide, were able to produce a much larger show with a bigger budget and more space to work with — Cinderella Castle is almost three times as tall as its Californian cousin.|$|R

5000|$|Calcium {{phosphide}} is {{also used}} in fireworks, torpedoes, self-igniting naval <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flares,</b> and various water-activated ammunition. During the 1920s and 1930s, Charles Kingsford Smith used separate buoyant canisters of calcium carbide and calcium phosphide as naval flares lasting up to ten minutes. It is speculated that calcium phosphide - made by boiling bones in urine, within a closed vessel - was an ingredient of some ancient Greek fire formulas.|$|R
500|$|To create green sparks, {{fireworks}} use barium salts, such as barium chlorate, {{barium nitrate}} crystals, or barium chloride, {{also used for}} green fireplace logs. Copper salts typically burn blue, but cupric chloride (also known as [...] "campfire blue") can also produce green flames. Green <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flares</b> can use a mix ratio 75:25 of boron and potassium nitrate. Smoke can be turned green by a mixture: solvent yellow 33, solvent green 3, lactose, magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate.|$|R

[...] In addition to the offensive armament, two <b>hand</b> operated <b>flare</b> launchers were initially provided, until LAU-74/A automatic launchers could be supplied. Besides the automated nature of the LAU-74/A, the unit only required one loadmaster to operate it.|$|R
40|$|We {{have found}} {{a large number of}} very strong flares in the {{available}} XTE PCA data of Cyg X- 1 (also seen in available HEXTE and BATSE data) with 13 flares satisfying our chosen threshold criterion, occuring both in the hard and the soft states. We analyze here in detail two of them. The strongest one took place in the soft state, with the 3 - 30 keV energy flux increasing 30 times with respect to the preceding 16 -s average. The e-folding time is ~ 7 ms for the main flare and ~ 1 ms for its precursor. The spectrum strongly hardens during the flare. On the other <b>hand,</b> <b>flares</b> in the hard state have generally lower amplitudes and longer e-folding times, and their spectra soften during the flare, with the hardness of the spectrum at the flare peak similar for both types of the flares. The presence of the flares shows unusually dramatic events taking place in the accretion flow of Cyg X- 1. On the other hand, the rate of occurence of hard-state flares shows they may represent a high-flux end of the distribution of shots present in usual lightcurves of Cyg X- 1.

2500|$|Most flares, {{like the}} MJU-27A/B flares, {{must be kept}} in an {{airtight}} storage compartment before deployment. These flares, known as pyrophoric flares, are made of special materials that ignite {{when they come in}} contact with the air. This is a safety and convenience factor, since attempting to ignite a flare inside [...] the fuselage and then deploying it is risky. However <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flares</b> (such as the MJU-32) also exist, and offer their own safety benefit; requiring an external ignition method, an accidental leak or puncture in the storage compartment would not result in a catastrophic fire on board the aircraft as with a pyrophoric flare.|$|R
50|$|Lara can now climb ladders {{and perform}} a mid-air roll used to land facing in the {{opposite}} direction. The range of weapons has been expanded to include a harpoon gun (though more correctly termed a speargun), a grenade launcher, an M16 rifle (which requires Lara to assume an aiming stance to fire), and automatic pistols, which replace the magnums from Tomb Raider. The inventory now includes <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flares,</b> which are used to light up dark corners. The two vehicles are a motorboat (in Venice) and a snowmobile (in Tibet). Both are used to travel long distances across the map and can speed up on ramps or run over enemies.|$|R
5000|$|Blue {{light is}} an archaic signal, the {{progenitor}} of modern <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flares.</b> Blue light {{consists of a}} loose, chemical composition burned in an open, hand-held hemispherical wooden cup, and so is more akin to the flashpan signals of the Admiral Nelson era than the modern, encased signal flares, often launched by mortar or rifle and suspended by parachute. Widely used during {{the eighteenth and nineteenth}} centuries for signaling by the world's military forces, and for general illumination in the civilian sector, blue light was remarkable for its use of poisonous arsenic compounds (realgar and orpiment), which contributed to its replacement by safer flares in the early twentieth century.|$|R
40|$|Aerosol {{particles}} from several anthropogenic sources associated with football stadia including cooking, cigarette smoking, burning of color smoke bombs and <b>hand</b> <b>flares</b> {{were analyzed by}} high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometry. The physical and chemical characteristics of these different aerosols, in particular the organic fraction, were explored in laboratory studies to obtain robust references. These data were compared with field campaign results from a Bundesliga (German football league) match in the Coface Arena (Mainz, Germany) on 20 th April 2012. The field measurement revealed a strongly elevated mass concentration of organic aerosols (OA) compared to background levels showing a temporal structure clearly related to the match. PMF analysis established that during the football match event cigarette smoke was the predominant component of submicron organic aerosol (67 % of total OA). Cooking emissions from food outlets within the stadium correlated well with the sales figures of the catering stations and were also found to be of relevance (24 % of total OA) especially in the period before kickoff. Pyrotechnics were not observed during this football match and no signatures of these sources {{were found in the}} mass spectra from the stadium measurements. All species that were elevated during the football match returned to their initial background levels within one hour after the match had finished. This demonstrates a good ventilation capacity of the open-topped Coface Arena. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

2500|$|Flares {{are most}} {{commonly}} gravity-fed from a dispenser inside [...] the aircraft's fuselage. These dispensers can be programmed {{by the pilot}} or ground crew to dispense flares in short intervals, one at a time, long intervals, or in clusters. Most currently used flares are of the pyrophoric variety, and thus the dispensers {{do not have to}} ignite and deploy the flare at the same time. With <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flares,</b> a lanyard automatically pulls off a friction cap covering the exposed end of the flare as it falls from the dispenser. A friction surface inside the cap rubs against the exposed end of the flare (similar to a match-head and striking surface) and ignites the flare.|$|R
40|$|Hygroscopic {{particles}} from <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flares</b> {{are widely used}} {{in a number of}} projects aimed at enhancement of precipitation from convective clouds (Cooper et al., 1997).

40|$|In 1985, an intrepid British sailor {{made his}} fourth {{attempt at a}} solo {{crossing}} of the Atlantic. According to a Los Angeles Times news item (“Sailor Is No Match, ” 1985), the 65 -year-old man set out from Campbletown, Scotland, in a five-foot boat, the Marmaduke Jinks IV. Almost immediately, his outboard engine lost power. So he hoisted sail, but his boat drifted backward and he fell asleep. When he woke up, he didn’t know where he was. He used an emergency <b>hand</b> <b>flare</b> and was rescued by the Coast Guard after having traveled four miles – the wrong way! As an aside, the article states {{that one of his}} previous attempts to cross the Atlantic was in 1984, when he set out from England in a barrel. When he boarded it, it capsized! Who knows what the sailor’s dreams consisted of. Does it matter, though whether he was motivated by a dream of innovation and accomplishment, or one of simple notoriety? In either event, he certainly did not surround himself with a high-technology system. How universal it is for humans early in life to dream many marvelous things. Not only are our nocturnal dreams so often filled with hopes and happy times, but in those years our waking state is also replete with aspirations to be someone heroic, or courageous, inventive, artistic, of high stature and recognition, of great wealth, with great wisdom, or some combination thereof...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Three drought relief {{cloud seeding}} {{programs}} were conducted ~n Georgia {{during the summer}} of 1977 by on-site meteorologists who flew on specially equipped seeding aircraft.

In limited evaluation of one of the three programs, a target~ontrol comparison indicated an excess of 27 percent in actual July-August precip-itation over that predicted from control area precipitation. A one tailed Student’s t test indicated less than five chances in 100 that this difference could be attributed to chance. 1...|$|R
60|$|Jumping on {{the stern}} grating {{he gave his}} orders, and they were obeyed. He saw Macallister, in pajamas, dive into the engine-room, and the screw began to throb; then barefooted men sprang into the boat alongside, and a heavy rope ran out across the rail. There was nothing more {{to be done for}} a few moments and, lashing the wheel, Grahame hurriedly lighted a <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flare.</b> The strong blue {{radiance}} drove back the gloom, and the water glittered among cakes of floating scum. Then the bright beam picked out the boat, with Walthew toiling, half-naked, at an oar, and Miguel's tall figure bending to and fro as he sculled astern. Another man was rowing forward, and his tense pose told of determined effort, but he vanished as the light moved on.|$|R
50|$|In {{the wake}} of shoulder-launched missile attacks against {{civilian}} passenger and cargo airliners in the early 2000s, various agencies investigated the feasibility of equipping countermeasures such as chaff and flares. Many commercial carriers found the estimated price of countermeasures to be too costly. However, the Israeli airline El-Al, having {{been the target of}} the failed 2002 airliner attack, in which shoulder-launched surface-to-air missiles were fired at an airliner while taking off, began equipping its fleet with radar-based, automated flare release countermeasures from June 2004. This caused concerns in some European countries, regarding the possible fire hazard at civilian airports, resulting in banning such aircraft from landing at their airports. In 2007, Saab announced a new infrared countermeasure system called CAMPS that does not use <b>pyrotechnic</b> <b>flares,</b> thereby directly addressing these concerns.|$|R

30|$|Perchlorate is {{identified}} as an environmental contaminant and found in drinking, ground, and surface waters, with its origins being both anthropogenic and natural. In its natural origin, perchlorate was found to originate from atmospheric deposition, possibly from chloride aerosol being exposed to an electrical discharge {{in the presence of}} ozone [1]. In Chile saltpetre [2], perchlorate is found as a natural impurity, and it is also of anthropogenic origin due to its use as solid propellant for rockets, missiles, fireworks, <b>pyrotechnics,</b> <b>flares,</b> matches, ordnance, and explosives [3]. Perchlorate is of toxicological interest because it impairs normal thyroid function by interfering with iodine uptake by the thyroid gland and the production of important thyroid hormones [4, 5]. Iodine-containing hormones are essential for early childhood development [6]. Hypothyroidism, a disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, in early stages of pregnancy bears the risk for impaired physical and mental development of the human foetus [7].|$|R
