Prendergast's role was to ensure continuity in wardrobe, actor position, and prop placement. Any changes in dialogue or ad-libbed lines were similarly written down.

So, Spielberg only revealed the hill scene, where Ray tries to stop his son from leaving, stating [...] "to say more would reveal too much."

500|$|The realism in the {{portrayal}} of the characters, and the universal theme of the film was widely lauded by critics. Gautaman Bhaskaran of Hindustan Times gave it 4 stars out of 5 and remarked that the film [...] "is a powerful and honest work", and Shubhra Gupta of The Indian Express noted that [...] "the film relies on <b>keeping</b> <b>things</b> real". Mohar Basu in his review at The Times of India described the movie as [...] "unpretentious", saying that [...] "the movie wins you over with its innocence and simplicity". Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV said the film resonated as [...] "a disarmingly simple and heart-warming film". Suparna Sharma of Deccan Chronicle called it a [...] "real film in a real setting about real people that delivers several empowering, powerful messages".|$|E
500|$|The {{title of}} the film refers to a video game character, [...] "The Chumscrubber", who helps his friends {{to survive in a}} {{superficial}} world by <b>keeping</b> <b>things</b> authentic, and is portrayed as a post-apocalyptic hero, carrying his severed head in his hand as he fights the forces of evil. The Chumscrubber's world was intended to be a reflection of the Hillside community, shown by the repetition of characters' lines in the video game; a voice in the game yells [...] "Kill him! Stab him! Get him again!", the exact line said by Billy to Lee {{at the end of the}} film, urging him to stab Charlie Bratley. Producer Bonnie Curtis described the character as [...] "this sub-human monster the kids feel they are becoming". Posin commented that [...] "the Chumscrubber is everything that that community has suppressed or denied or tried to ignore, and [...] the idea that the collective denial of the community as a whole finally gives birth to a character that will not be ignored".|$|E

500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{after the end}} of the series. Michelle Erica Green {{reviewed}} the episode in January 2004 for TrekNation. She disliked the changes to The Original Series era Klingons, and was disappointed that plot threads that the characters faced in their previous appearances such as the fate of the tribbles in [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles" [...] weren't resolved. She thought that the episode was one of the better ones to place Dax in a central position and ignored any inconsistencies because she was a fan of cross-generational episodes. Jamahl Epsicokhan at his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews" [...] thought that [...] "characterizations are flawless" [...] and that the fight scene at the end of the episode was impressive. He gave the episode a score of three and a half out of four. Zack Handlen watched the episode for The A.V. Club in June 2012. He thought that the episode worked, but wasn't as powerful as it could have been and said [...] "it’s too formal and too solemn to really rouse up the blood, and the most intriguing aspects of the plot are put to the side in favor of <b>keeping</b> <b>things</b> as straightforward as possible." ...|$|E
500|$|Mirkin {{directed}} the feature film Romy and Michele's High School Reunion in 1997. The film stars Mira Sorvino and Lisa Kudrow as two friends determined {{to show their}} former high school tormentors at their 10-year reunion that they have led successful lives. Mirkin said of the film: [...] "These are women characters we haven't seen before. There are so few female buddy movies, written funny for women. Women don't get to do odd, strange, self-involved roles like these." [...] He knew Kudrow previously and felt she was [...] "perfect" [...] for the role, but did not expect Sorvino would take the part given her recent Academy Award win for Mighty Aphrodite, but it [...] "turn out that she'd had a horrible time in high school, so the story appealed to her". The film received critical praise, as did Mirkin's direction. James Berardinelli wrote that Mirkin [...] "brings {{a lot of energy}} to the production, always <b>keeping</b> <b>things</b> moving", while Jack Matthews of The Los Angeles Times says Mirkin [...] "knew exactly what he had here and composed it like frames in a comic strip, ordering cheerful snow-cone colors for everything from the girls' childlike outfits to the decor of a Laundromat".|$|E
500|$|Nick de Semlyen from Empire {{considered}} it an average film, saying [...] "It's familiar ground for anyone who's seen Black Book or Sophie Scholl, but director Ole Christian Madsen steers a skilful course, <b>keeping</b> <b>things</b> grim {{but not to}} an off-putting extent, bringing a David Lynch-esque vibe to Flame's hotel dalliances with a shady lady and pulling off an incredible death scene {{for one of the}} leads." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club criticized it for [...] "hammer too hard on the shopworn theme of how war sickens souls. Far more interesting is Flame & Citrons other theme: the idea that war turns the notion of 'shades of gray' into a luxury". V.A. Musetto, for the New York Post, commented that, although it [...] "features well-choreographed shootouts and assassinations", its [...] "script is too melodramatic and complicated for its own good". Burr mostly praised it but said that [...] "Madsen eventually loses his way", stating that there was [...] "not enough" [...] information about Citron and that the film [...] "feels packed with events and frustratingly unfocused". Derakhshani argued that it [...] "has some rough, tedious patches– at 130 minutes, it's simply too long. And its reiteration of Hollywood cliches isn't always successful. Regardless, it is, along with Paul Verhoeven's Black Book, one of the most accomplished films {{to come out of the}} recent wave of neoclassic and revisionist WWII films".|$|E

If you look at how much of our page is taken up with ads compared to the average search query.

This film contains not a single plausible moment after the opening sequence, and that's borderline. It's not an assault on intelligence. It's an assault on consciousness." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{one and a half}} stars out of four, saying: [...] "This movie tests the viewing public's tolerance for enduring crass stupidity when the payoff is a series of repetitive, ADD-infected chase scenes. Director D.J. Caruso does a moderately good job of hiding how incredibly dumb this screenplay is by <b>keeping</b> <b>things</b> moving at such a whirlwind pace that a lot more seems to be happening than actually is. In reality, the chase scenes don't mean anything because they don't advance the plot—it's mice on a treadmill, running and running and not getting anywhere."

[...] Powers added [...] "Her lyrics, though hardly {{avoiding}} familiar sex talk, meld common exhibitionism with convincing intimacies. [...] Jackson brings bliss back to a subject that too many dirty-mouthed hotties have made tedious through overexposure." [...] The album was also considered a [...] "soul-baring, bedroom-eyed record" [...] which was [...] "swimming in pop hooks." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian rated Damita Jo {{four out of}} five stars, saying [...] "Damita Jo's opening salvo is an object lesson in <b>keeping</b> <b>things</b> concise. Four tracks, each barely three minutes long, go hurtling past in a head-spinning blur of snapping rhythms, buzzing synthesized noise and oddly disconnected samples: cut-up vocals and glockenspiel on Strawberry Bounce, rattling tablas on Sexhibition. Elsewhere, there are impossibly lithe basslines - notably on All Nite (Don't Stop) and I Want You, an intriguing electronic reconstruction of an early 1970s soul ballad." [...] Petridis heralded the record as [...] "not only inventive, but brilliantly constructed," [...] with nagging hooks and [...] "explosive" [...] choruses. Calling pop a [...] "singles genre," [...] Power's said [...] "Damita Jos strike rate is remarkably high. It's triumphant stuff." [...] Warner Bros. Publications declared the album [...] "flirty, sensual, hot pop" [...] in [...] "traditional Janet style", adding [...] "The slow grooves blend together and the seductive vocals express passion." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice said [...] "Damita Jo starts off bold - But as the album proceeds it gets realer, mostly whispered softcore by the second half even when it's love songs per se. Call me immature, but I figure there's never enough good sex in the world. In a culture inundated with dirty pornos, Damita Jo is good sex." ...|$|E
