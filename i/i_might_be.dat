Before then, I'd been frustrated because I wanted to be more hands-on. I just feel that TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, and I thought that perhaps <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> well-placed to do it.|$|E
25|$|The {{antiarrhythmic}} drug lidocaine {{has been}} reported to be an effective treatment of aconitine poisoning of a patient. Considering the fact that aconitine acts as an agonist of the sodium channel receptor, antiarrhythmic agents which block the sodium channel (Vaughan-Williams' classification <b>I)</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> the first choice for the therapy of aconitine induced arrhythmias.|$|E

I cannot {{describe}} it. <b>I</b> <b>might</b> say it <b>was</b> clear; <b>I</b> <b>might</b> say it <b>was</b> sweet; <b>I</b> <b>might</b> say it <b>was</b> vibrant and far-reaching and bell-like; all this would be true, but it would give you no real idea of the peculiar quality which made the Story Girl's voice what it was.|$|R

25|$|During reverse {{electron}} transfer, complex <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> {{the most}} important site of superoxide production within mitochondria, with up to 5% of electrons being diverted to superoxide formation. Reverse electron transfer, {{the process by which}} electrons from the reduced ubiquinol pool (supplied by succinate dehydrogenase, glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, or dihydro-oorotate dehydrogenase in mammalian mitochondria) pass through complex I to reduce NAD+ to NADH, driven by the inner mitochondrial membrane potential electric potential. Although it is not precisely known under what pathological conditions reverse-electron transfer would occur in vivo, in vitro experiments indicate that it can be a very potent source of superoxide when succinate concentrations are high and oxaloacetate or malate concentrations are low.|$|E
25|$|Still another {{possibility}} is that the code generated may employ an auxiliary variable as the loop variable, possibly held in a machine register, whose value {{may or may not be}} copied to I on each iteration. Again, modifications of I would not affect the control of the loop, but now a disjunction is possible: within the loop, references to the value of <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> to the (possibly altered) current value of I or to the auxiliary variable (held safe from improper modification) and confusing results are guaranteed. For instance, within the loop a reference to element I of an array would likely employ the auxiliary variable (especially if it were held in a machine register), but if I is a parameter to some routine (for instance, a print-statement to reveal its value), it would likely be a reference to the proper variable I instead. It is best to avoid such possibilities.|$|E

500|$|The live {{version of}} [...] "True Love Waits" [...] {{released}} on <b>I</b> <b>Might</b> <b>Be</b> Wrong: Live Recordings has Yorke performing the song alone on acoustic guitar. According to Pitchfork, it features unexpected chord changes and [...] "vehement" [...] guitar strumming. The Phoenix New Times likened the [...] "earnest" [...] and [...] "simple" [...] arrangement to Radiohead songs {{written in the}} same era, such as [...] "Fake Plastic Trees" [...] and [...] "Bullet Proof..I Wish I Was", both from The Bends.|$|E
500|$|Reviewing <b>I</b> <b>Might</b> <b>Be</b> Wrong in 2001, Matt LeMay of Pitchfork {{wrote that}} [...] "True Love Waits" [...] is [...] "absolutely {{gorgeous}} ... it can hold its own against any song on OK Computer." [...] He {{felt that the}} song, along {{with the performance of}} [...] "Like Spinning Plates", [...] "justified the existence" [...] of the EP. Ted Kessler of the NME praised Yorke's vocals as [...] "clear and true". Nicholas Taylor of PopMatters praised the song as [...] "a bittersweet victory of love" [...] which [...] "shows that behind all of Radiohead's modernist nightmares is a fragile, desperate desire to connect, fully and meaningfully, with just one person." ...|$|E
500|$|Although mostly {{occupied}} with Thunderbird 6 and Doppelgänger, Derek Meddings briefly reprised {{his role as}} head of special effects to construct Professor McClaine's Jet Air Car. The design concept was a disappointment to Anderson, who commented: [...] "The car looked like no other piece of hardware we had had previously but I was wary of canning it as I feared <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> becoming stereotyped. Maybe {{the whole thing was}} becoming a bit narrow; all the ideas were becoming similar." [...] Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future, views the Jet Air Car as an update of Supercar, the vehicle that appeared in Anderson's 1961 series of the same name, but agrees that while the Jet Air Car is the [...] "star vehicle" [...] of Joe 90, it is visually unappealing in comparison to the [...] "beautiful, sleek design of its predecessor." ...|$|E

500|$|Okereke's lyrics {{attempt to}} {{juxtapose}} the monotonous events—nights out on club dancefloors {{and waiting for}} a train—with the seemingly epic experiences—terrorist attacks and racial angst—witnessed in a city environment. The direct narrative approach divided reviewers. BBC's Tom Young concluded, [...] "Some will appreciate Kele's openness and revel in his philosophical focus on modern lives... others will be too distracted by questionable content such as... lines about sudoku to take Okereke's grumbles into consideration." [...] Okereke has conceded that he was disappointed with the abstraction in Silent Alarm; he used The Smiths as inspiration {{to try to make}} a personal album with [...] "a real centre". The lyricist has noted, [...] "I wanted it to be a snapshot, a frozen moment in time. Like in a city, with thousands of stories going on at once, layered on top of each other... Although <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> speaking through the voice of a character, I'm still expressing, perhaps, my sentiments." ...|$|E
500|$|Wooden Leg {{attended}} a [...] "peace feast" [...] at the Little Bighorn {{to commemorate the}} 30th anniversary of the battle. [...] Some Cheyenne veterans would not go, fearful of retribution from the soldiers present. [...] As late as 1926 there were still Cheyennes who would {{not go to the}} 50th anniversary. [...] Wooden Leg himself did not attend the 50th anniversary, not out of fear, but because the site was now on Crow land, to whom he still felt much animosity. [...] He had resolved [...] "never again to go to any place where <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> called upon to shake hands with a Crow". [...] This was very different to his attitude to other former enemies such as the Shoshones, to whom he travelled on a friendly visit. [...] In 1913 Wooden Leg was part of a Cheyenne delegation to Washington. [...] He also visited New York and Philadelphia during this trip.|$|E
500|$|... "Dwight Christmas" [...] {{was written}} by {{executive}} story editor Robert Padnick, marking his fourth writing credit for the series after joining the writing staff in the seventh season. It was directed by Charles McDougall, his first directing credit for the season. McDougal's first job for the series was directing its first Christmas episode during the show's second season. The basic plot of the episode, involving Belsnickel, had originally been conceived during the writing for fourth season {{and was going to}} air as that year's Christmas installment. However, the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike halted production, and the unfinished script was never used. According to executive producer and showrunner Greg Daniels, the writing staff wanted to use the premise for many years, but could never find a right time to implement it, until an opportunity during the show's last season presented itself. Before the episode aired, Kemper, in an interview with TV Guide said that [...] "I feel like <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> expected to say this because it is the last one, but I truly love this episode so much" [...] and that she [...] "specifically love Dwight's storyline" [...] because [...] "he brings in his family Christmas traditions. I've always held Dwight as one of my favorite characters and now 'Dwight Christmas' just takes it to a new level." [...] Fischer said that filming the last Christmas episode was [...] "emotional" [...] and regretted not being able to have Mindy Kaling, who portrayed Kelly Kapoor on the series, film a karaoke scene. This is the second episode of season nine to not feature Andy or Clark. Ed Helms, who portrayed Andy, left the show temporarily in the season's sixth episode [...] "The Boat" [...] in order to film The Hangover Part III, whereas Clark Duke, who portrayed Clark, left for a few episodes to film Kick-Ass 2.|$|E

2500|$|Gwynn {{attended}} Long Beach Polytechnic High School, {{which was}} a high-profile school in sports. He was a two-sport star in both basketball and baseball. In his final two years, his Jackrabbits baseball teams were a combined 3-25-2 in the league, while the basketball teams went 53-6 and twice reached the California Interscholastic Federation (CIF) Southern Section 4A championship game. Gwynn had considered quitting baseball as a senior to concentrate on basketball, but his mother talked him out of it.
