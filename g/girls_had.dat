5|$|Accounts by 19th-century historians {{suggest that}} Day grew {{impatient}} with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant {{they would not have}} rebelled excessively.|$|E
5|$|<b>Girls</b> <b>had</b> equal {{inheritance}} {{rights with}} boys if their father died without leaving a will. A Roman mother's {{right to own}} property and to dispose of it as she saw fit, including setting the terms of her own will, gave her enormous influence over her sons even when they were adults.|$|E
5|$|Hindley's {{first job}} {{was as a}} junior clerk at a local {{electrical}} engineering firm. She ran errands, made tea, and typed. She was well liked at the firm, enough so that when she lost her first week's wage packet, the other <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> a collection to replace it. Beginning at Christmas 1958, Hindley began a short relationship with Ronnie Sinclair, and became engaged at 17. The engagement was called off several months later; Hindley apparently thought Sinclair immature, and unable to provide her with the life she envisaged for herself.|$|E

Her primary distinction, with me, {{consists}} in something quite other than these.

5|$|On {{the night}} of May 30, two girls fall victim to the Apathy Syndrome {{in front of the}} school which prompts {{widespread}} rumors. Yukari, Junpei and Makoto go looking for answers from the delinquents behind Port Island Station and learn from Shinjiro Aragaki (Kazuya Nakai) that the <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> been bullying Fuka before the latter suddenly disappeared that same night. On June 8, Natsuki confesses to Mitsuru that she and her friends had locked Fuka inside the school's gymnasium. However when her friends went to check on Fuka that same night, she had mysteriously vanished while the latter developed the Apathy cases after being preyed on by Shadows. That night the SEES members deduce that Fuka may be trapped inside the Tartarus tower and plan to rescue her. However when Mitsuru asks Makoto to accompany them, Yukari grows frustrated at his ambivalence and he excludes himself from the mission. Instead, Mitsuru elects him to protect Natsuki at the dorm where he listens to Natsuki's reasoning for bullying Fuka and relates that Fuka genuinely considers her as a friend.|$|E
5|$|The {{exposition}} to Night Trap {{is presented}} to the player by Lt. Simms of the Sega Control Attack Team (S.C.A.T.) {{at the start of}} the game. He explains that the team was alerted to the disappearance of five teenage girls who were last seen at the Martin winery estate. The Martin family consists of Victor Martin, his wife Sheila, their children Jeff and Sarah, and cousin Tony. The missing girls were reportedly invited to stay for the night. Police questioned the Martin family, but they claimed the <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> left safely, and they refused to let the police search the property. The police then handed over the case to S.C.A.T., which investigated the house and discovered a series of traps, security cameras, and an operational unit in the basement to control the apparatus. The S.C.A.T. agents spliced an override cable onto the control system and connected it to a control panel in the back hallway of the house. The player is given the role of an internal S.C.A.T. operative charged with controlling the traps and cameras from this back hallway.|$|E
25|$|Boys and <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> {{separate}} classes {{until about}} 1870. Boys learned useful {{skills such as}} woodshop, surveying, and bookkeeping, and <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> classes like sewing. However, Westtown eventually recognized that students of both genders should know basic academic subjects such as reading, penmanship, grammar, mathematics, geography, and science.|$|E

They {{have been}} known to seek the society of girls in general, of any girl, because some <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> made them happy; and when some <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> made them unhappy, they are still more susceptible. Burnamy may be merely amusing himself, or he may be consoling himself; but in either case I think the pivotal <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> as much right to him as Miss Triscoe.

25|$|The Special Rapporteur on Rwanda {{estimated}} in his 1996 report that between 2,000 and 5,000 pregnancies resulted from war rape, and that between 250,000 and 500,000 Rwandese women and <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> been raped. Rwanda is a patriarchal society and children therefore take the ethnicity of the father, underlining {{the fact that}} war rape occurred {{in the context of}} genocide.|$|E
25|$|Sinclair {{pleaded not}} guilty to rape and murder. At the {{commencement}} of the trial diet Sinclair lodged two special defences, one of consent and one of incrimination, stating that any sexual activity between him and the two <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> been consensual, and that if they had come to any harm, the person responsible was Gordon Hamilton.|$|E

25|$|During {{the colonial}} era, {{until the early}} 20th century, there was a gender {{struggle}} among Muslims in the British empire; educating women {{was viewed as a}} prelude to social chaos, a threat to the moral order, and man's world was viewed as a source of Muslim identity. Muslim women in British India, nevertheless, pressed for their rights independent of men; by the 1930s, 2.5 million <b>girls</b> <b>had</b> entered schools of which 0.5 million were Muslims.|$|E
25|$|On 9 August, CCTV {{footage of}} the girls from {{a few minutes before}} their {{disappearance}} was released, showing them arriving at the local sports centre.

On 10 August, a reconstruction of the girls' movements was produced using two child actresses to encourage witnesses to come forward.|$|E
