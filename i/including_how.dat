Bede records the letter and Gregory's replies in chapter 27 of his Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, {{this section of the}} History is usually known as the Libellus responsionum. Augustine asked for Gregory's advice on some issues, <b>including</b> <b>how</b> to organise the church, the punishment for church robbers, guidance on who was allowed to marry whom, and the consecration of bishops. Other topics were relations between the churches of Britain and Gaul, childbirth and baptism, and when it was lawful for people to receive communion and for a priest to celebrate mass. Other than the trip by Laurence, little is known of the activities of the missionaries in the period from their arrival until 601. Gregory mentions the mass conversions, and there is mention of Augustine working miracles that helped win converts, but there is little evidence of specific events.|$|E

5|$|As Strike Back is a {{military}} drama, the production crew used a vast catalogue of firearms, including side arms, assault and sniper rifles, as well as rocket-propelled grenades, hand grenades and other explosives. Cast members were first taught by carrying weights that mimicked {{the weight of the}} weapons so they could get used to carrying it during filming. Later, they were taught how to carry them professionally, <b>including</b> <b>how</b> to disassemble and re-assemble them, as well as how to fire and reload. Though the majority were actually rubber, duplicates were sometimes used for some of the background characters.

5|$|Even though Lana {{eventually}} marries Lex {{in season}} six, Al Gough argues that Lana still loved Clark and Clark still loved her.

Dries believes that the progression of the show demonstrates that Lex earned Lana's love. To answer viewers that hated to see Lana marry Lex, Dries contends that as viewers we are seeing all of Lex, <b>including</b> <b>how</b> evil he truly is, while Lana only sees the portion of Lex that appears good.|$|E
