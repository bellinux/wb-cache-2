5|$|Poliovirus uses two key {{mechanisms}} {{to evade the}} immune system. First, {{it is capable of}} surviving the highly acidic conditions of the stomach, allowing the virus to infect the host and spread throughout the body via the lymphatic system. Second, because it can replicate very quickly, the virus overwhelms the host organs before an immune response can be mounted. If detail is given at the attachment phase; poliovirus with canyons on the virion surface have virus attachment sites located in pockets at the canyon bases. The canyons are too narrow for access by antibodies, so the virus attachment sites are protected from the host’s <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance,</b> while the remainder of the virion surface can mutate to avoid the host’s immune response.|$|E
5|$|The {{parasite}} {{is relatively}} protected from {{attack by the}} body's immune system because {{for most of its}} human life cycle it resides within the liver and blood cells and is relatively invisible to <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance.</b> However, circulating infected blood cells are destroyed in the spleen. To avoid this fate, the P.falciparum parasite displays adhesive proteins {{on the surface of the}} infected blood cells, causing the blood cells to stick to the walls of small blood vessels, thereby sequestering the parasite from passage through the general circulation and the spleen. The blockage of the microvasculature causes symptoms such as in placental malaria. Sequestered red blood cells can breach the blood–brain barrier and cause cerebral malaria.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} role {{of the immune system}} is to identify and eliminate tumors. This is called <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance.</b> The transformed cells of tumors express antigens that are not found on normal cells. To the immune system, these antigens appear foreign, and their presence causes immune cells to attack the transformed tumor cells. The antigens expressed by tumors have several sources; some are derived from oncogenic viruses like human papillomavirus, which causes cervical cancer, while others are the organism's own proteins that occur at low levels in normal cells but reach high levels in tumor cells. One example is an enzyme called tyrosinase that, when expressed at high levels, transforms certain skin cells (e.g. melanocytes) into tumors called melanomas. A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes.|$|E

50|$|The major {{histocompatibility}} complex in sexual selection concerns how major {{histocompatibility complex}} (MHC) molecules allow for <b>immune</b> system <b>surveillance</b> {{of the population of}} protein molecules in a host's cells. In 1976, Yamazaki et al. demonstrated a sexual selection mate choice by male mice for females of a different MHC.|$|R
40|$|Kaposi's sarcoma-associated {{herpesvirus}} (KSHV) latency {{is central}} to the evasion of host <b>immune</b> <b>surveillances</b> and induction of KSHV-related malignancies. The mechanism of KSHV latency remains unclear. Here, we show that the KSHV latent gene vFLIP promotes viral latency by inhibiting viral lytic replication. vFLIP suppresses the AP- 1 pathway, which is essential for KSHV lytic replication, by activating the NF-κB pathway. Thus, by manipulating two convergent cellular pathways, vFLIP regulates both cell survival and KSHV lytic replication to promote viral latency. These results also indicate that the effect of the NF-κB pathway on KSHV replication is determined by the status of the AP- 1 pathway and hence provide a mechanistic explanation for the contradictory role of the NF-κB pathway in KSHV replication. Since the NF-κB pathway is commonly activated during infection of gammaherpesviruses, these findings might have general implications for the control of gammaherpesviral latency...|$|R
25|$|The latent {{programs}} reprogram and subvert infected B-lymphocytes to proliferate {{and bring}} infected cells to the sites {{at which the}} virus presumably persists. Eventually, when host immunity develops, the virus persists by turning off most (or possibly all) of its genes, only occasionally reactivating to produce fresh virions. A balance is eventually struck between occasional viral reactivation and host <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance</b> removing cells that activate viral gene expression.|$|E
25|$|However, CYR61 {{can also}} induce {{apoptosis}} and cellular senescence, two well-established mechanisms of tumor suppression Thus, whereas CYR61 can promote {{the proliferation of}} prostate cancer cells, it can also exacerbate apoptosis of these cells {{in the presence of}} the <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance</b> molecule TRAIL. CYR61 has an inhibitory effect on some cancers, and suppresses tumor growth of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells, endometrial adenocarcinoma cells, and in melanoma cells.|$|E
25|$|The use of cAMP as a {{chemotactic}} {{agent is}} not established {{in any other}} organism. In developmental biology, {{this is one of}} the comprehensible examples of chemotaxis, which is important for an understanding of human inflammation, arthritis, asthma, lymphocyte trafficking, and axon guidance. Phagocytosis is used in <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance</b> and antigen presentation, while cell-type determination, cell sorting, and pattern formation are basic features of embryogenesis that may be studied with these organisms.|$|E
25|$|MHC {{molecules}} enable <b>immune</b> system <b>surveillance</b> of {{the population}} of protein molecules in a host cell, and greater MHC diversity permits greater diversity of antigen presentation. In 1976, Yamazaki et al demonstrated a sexual selection mate choice by male mice for females of a different MHC. Similar results have been obtained with fish. Some data find lower rates of early pregnancy loss in human couples of dissimilar MHC genes.|$|R
50|$|This protein {{may also}} play a role in {{lymphocyte}} recirculation by blocking LFA-1-dependent cell adhesion. It mediates adhesive interactions important for antigen-specific immune response, NK-cell mediated clearance, lymphocyte recirculation, and other cellular interactions important for <b>immune</b> response and <b>surveillance.</b>|$|R
40|$|More than 60 {{million people}} in the world have been {{diagnosed}} with HIV infections since the virus was recognized as the causative agent of AIDS in the 1980 s. Even though {{more than half of the}} infected patients have died, effective disease treatment and prevention measures have not been established. ART (antiretroviral therapy) is the only proven HIV treatment that sustains the suppression of patient viraemia. Current routine approaches to treat HIV infections are targeted at developing vaccines that will induce humoral or cell memory immune responses. However, developing an effective vaccine has been challenging because the HIV mutates rapidly, which allows the virus to evade <b>immune</b> <b>surveillances</b> established against the previous strain. In addition, the virus is able to quickly establish a reservoir and treatment is difficult because of the general lack of knowledge about HIV immune response mechanisms. This review introduces common disease symptoms and the progression of HIV infection with a brief summary of the current treatment approaches. Different cellular immune responses against HIV are also discussed, with emphasis on a nanotechnology research that has focused on probing T-cell response to HIV infection. Furthermore, we discuss recent noteworthy nanotechnology updates on T-cell response screening that is focused on HIV infection. Finally, we review potential future treatment strategies based on the correlations between T-cell response and HIV infection...|$|R
500|$|HIV {{seeks out}} and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4+ T cells during acute infection. [...] A {{vigorous}} immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase. CD4+ T cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected. Continuous HIV replication causes {{a state of}} generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase. Immune activation, which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication. It is also linked to {{the breakdown of the}} <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance</b> system of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4+ T cells during the acute phase of disease.|$|E

30|$|Psychological or psychosocial stress {{has been}} {{emerging}} {{as one of}} the key factors associated with cancer initiation, growth, and metastasis.

Depression is closely linked to stress and induces hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activation as well as sympathetic nervous system (SNS) down to <b>immune</b> cell <b>surveillance.</b> This review briefly describes the activation of neuroendocrine system by psychological stress/depression and its effect on cancer occurrence and metastasis, which may be useful for the design of new cancer treatments.|$|R

This paper deals with the derivation of a generalized thermostatted kinetic framework, which incorporates particles refuge. From the qualitative viewpoint, the global in time existence and uniqueness of {{the solution to the}} relative Cauchy problem, the time evolution of the moments of the solution, and the existence of stationary solutions are discussed. Applications refer to biological systems and especially to tumor-escape from <b>immune</b> system <b>surveillance,</b> indeed within this framework an mathematical model for the tumorimmune system competition is derived.

40|$|Abstract Background Renal cell {{carcinoma}} (RCC) represents approximately 3 % of all adult cancers {{and is more}} common in males. Systemic treatment for RCC has improved following the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as sunitinib. The molecular targets of sunitinib are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Moreover, sunitinib has an additional anti-angiogenic effect through its inhibition of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor activation. Case presentation We present a case of intra-abdominal abscess formation mimicking disease progression, in a patient with metastatic renal {{cell carcinoma}} during sunitinib treatment. Conclusion In the advancing era of molecular therapy of solid tumours, sunitinib has demonstrated significant efficacy in the post-cytokine setting treatment of metastatic renal cancer. Concurrently, however, increasing evidence has emerged to indicate that this class of drugs exert profound immunomodulatory effects on T cells and play major roles in <b>immune</b> tumor <b>surveillance.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|We report {{here that}} the {{alternatively}} spliced nuclear factors associated with double-stranded RNA, NFAR- 1 (90 kDa) and - 2 (110 kDa), are involved in retaining cellular transcripts in intranuclear foci and can regulate the export of mRNA to the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the NFAR proteins were found to remain associated with exported ribonucleoprotein complexes. Loss of NFAR function, which was embryonic-lethal, caused an increase in protein synthesis rates, an effect augmented {{by the presence of}} the mRNA export factors TAP, p 15, or Rae 1. Significantly, NFAR depletion in normal murine fibroblasts rendered these cells dramatically susceptible to vesicular stomatitis virus replication. Collectively, our data demonstrate that the NFARs exert influence on mRNA trafficking and the modulation of translation rates and may constitute an innate <b>immune</b> translational <b>surveillance</b> mechanism important in host defense countermeasures against virus infection...|$|R
40|$|Shigella spp. are the causative {{agents of}} bacillary dysentery, leading to {{extensive}} mortality and morbidity worldwide. These facultative intracellular bacteria invade the epithelium {{of the colon}} and the rectum, inducing a severe inflammatory response from which the symptoms of the disease originate. Shigella are human pathogens able to manipulate and subvert the innate <b>immune</b> system <b>surveillance.</b> Shigella dampens inflammasome activation in epithelial cells. In infected macrophages, inflammasome activation and IL- 1 β and IL- 18 release lead to massive neutrophil recruitment and greatly contribute to inflammation. Here, we describe how Shigella hijacks and finely tunes inflammasome activation in the different cell populations involved in pathogenesis: epithelial cells, macrophages, neutrophils, DCs, and B and T lymphocytes. Shigella emerges as a “sly” pathogen that switches on/off the inflammasome mechanisms in order to optimize the interaction with the host and establish a successful infection...|$|R
50|$|The {{fate of the}} virus-infected cell {{is almost}} always {{induction}} of apoptosis through cell-mediated immunity, {{reducing the risk of}} infecting neighboring cells. As an evolutionary response to this method of <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance,</b> many viruses are able to down-regulate or otherwise prevent the presentation of MHC class I molecules on the cell surface. In contrast to cytotoxic T lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells are normally inactivated upon recognizing MHC I molecules on the surface of cells. Therefore, in the absence of MHC I molecules, NK cells are activated and recognize the cell as aberrant, suggesting that it may be infected by viruses attempting to evade immune destruction. Several human cancers also show down-regulation of MHC I, giving transformed cells the same survival advantage of being able to avoid normal <b>immune</b> <b>surveillance</b> designed to destroy any infected or transformed cells.|$|E

40|$|Wiskott-Aldrich {{syndrome}} (WAS) is an X-linked {{primary immunodeficiency}} disorder caused by mutations in the WAS gene, resulting in defects in the gene product, the WAS protein (WASP). WASP directs {{the formation of}} polymerized actin filaments during the cytoskeletal rearrangements required for <b>immune</b> system <b>surveillance</b> and homeostasis. Currently, the only cure for WAS is a bone marrow transplant. This study aimed to correct a known gene mutation causing WAS in human {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs). A pair of TALENs were constructed to target a known gene mutation in WAS iPSCs. A single strand oligodeoxynucleotide served as a donor template for the wild-type WAS gene, leading to a gene correction via homology-directed recombination (HDR). The efficiency of HDR was approximately 7 % in 293 T cells, but was 0 % in WAS iPSCs. This approach may represent a useful strategy for autologous gene therapy in WAS and other inherited human diseases...|$|R
40|$|A 74 -year-old female was {{diagnosed}} with the autoimmune inflammatory disease temporal arteritis and treated with high and low doses of prednisone {{over a period of}} 6 years.

40|$|What {{level of}} {{immunocompetence}} should an animal maintain while undertaking long-distance dispersal? <b>Immune</b> function (<b>surveillance</b> and response) might be down-regulated during prolonged physical exertion due to energy depletion, and/or to avoid autoimmune reactions arising from damaged tissue. On the other hand, heightened immune vigilance might be favored if the organism encounters novel pathogens as it enters novel environments. We assessed {{the links between}} immune defense and long-distance movement in a population of invasive cane toads (Rhinella marina) in Australia. Toads were radio-tracked for seven days to measure their activity levels and were then captured and subjected to a suite of immune assays. Toads that moved further showed decreased bacteria-killing ability in their plasma and decreased phagocytic activity in their whole blood, but a heightened skin-swelling response to phytohemagglutinin. Baseline and post-stress corticosterone levels were unrelated to distance moved. Thus, long-distance movement in cane toads {{is associated with a}} dampened response in some systems and enhanced response in another. This pattern suggests that sustained activity is accompanied by trade-offs among immune components rather than an overall down or up-regulation. The finding that high mobility is accompanied by modification of the immune system has important implications for animal invasions...|$|R
40|$|Visceral leishmaniasis, {{caused by}} the {{protozoan}} parasite Leishmania donovani, {{is characterized by the}} loss of ability of the host to generate an effective immune response. In the present study, the comparative potential of CXC chemokines, interferon-g–inducible protein- 10 (IP- 10) and interleukin- 8 (IL- 8) in restricting Leish-mania donovani infection via the release of nitric oxide and proinflammatory cytokines was studied in an in vitro model. Nitric oxide, a crucial mediator for IP- 10 –mediated leishmanicidal activity, was found to be dependent on inducible nitric oxide synthase 2 (iNOS 2) expression and was linked to the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway. Further, IP- 10 was also able to abrogate the survival of Leishmania in an in vivo model of visceral leishmaniasis by restoration of Th 1 cytokines and nitric oxide. Thus, this study strongly demonstrates that IP- 10, like CC chemokines, is involved in rendering a protective response in visceral leishmaniasis via up-regulation of proinflammatory mediators. Visceral leishmaniasis, {{caused by the}} protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani, is associated with immunological dysfunctions of T cells, natural killer cells, and mac-rophages [1 – 3].

40|$|Ovulation is the complex, inflammatory-like {{process by}} which the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) is {{released}} from a mature, preovulatory follicle through a rupture site at the ovarian surface and requires expression of genes that generate and stabilize the expanded extracellular COC matrix. Gene profiling analyses of COCs at selected time intervals during ovulation revealed that many genes associated with <b>immune</b> related <b>surveillance</b> functions were also induced in cumulus cells. Specifically, cell surface signaling molecules known as pattern recognition receptors that act as sensors of the external environment important for the innate immune system to detect self from nonself or altered self are induced and/or expressed in cumulus cells as well as granulosa cells.
