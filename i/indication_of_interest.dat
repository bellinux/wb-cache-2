50|$|An <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> (IOI), {{sometimes}} {{expression of}} interest (EOI), is an expression in finance that demonstrates a buyer's non-binding interest in buying a security in the stock market, often before it is available for purchase.

5000|$|A {{crossing}} {{network is}} an alternative trading system (ATS) that matches buy and sell orders electronically for execution without first routing the order to an exchange or other displayed market, such as an electronic communication network (ECN), which displays a public quote. These broker-dealers employ computerized systems to match buyers and sellers of large blocks of shares without using the stock exchange. Depending on the particular broker-dealer's system {{and the type of}} securities traded (e.g., exchange-listed or OTC securities), these crosses could occur at various times during the day, or after the close of trading, and could be priced at the last sale price or some other objective price, such as the midpoint between the bid and offer or the volume weighted average price (VWAP). [...] The advantage of the crossing network is the ability to execute a large block order without impacting the public quote. Crossing networks tend to be used for highly liquid stocks and offer money managers the advantages of very low commissions (e.g., 1 to 2 cents per share or lower), anonymity for the buying or selling account, and avoidance of market impact (i.e., movements in a stock's price due to an investor's <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest).</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{perception}} of physician shortage in Canada is widespread. Absolute shortages and relative discrepancies, both specialty-wise and in urban-rural distribution, {{have been a}} daunting policy challenge. International Medical Graduates (IMGs) {{have been at the}} core of mitigating this problem, especially as long as shortage of physicians in rural areas is concerned. Considering such recruitment as historical reality is naïve annotation, but when it is recommended per se, then the <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> overweighs the intent of ethically justified solution. Such a recommendation has not only invited policy debate and disagreement, but has also raised serious ethical concerns. Canadian healthcare policy-makers were put into a series of twisting puzzles—recruiting IMGs in mitigating physician shortage was questioned by lack of vision for Canada’s self-sufficiency. In-migration of IMGs was largely attributed to Canada’s point-based physician-friendly immigration system without much emphasizing on IMGs’ home countries’ unfavorable factors and ignoring their basic human rights and choice of livelihood. While policy-makers’ excellence in integrating the already-migrated IMGs into the Canadian healthcare is cautiously appraised, its logical consequence in passively drawing more IMGs is loudly criticised. Even the passive recruitment of IMGs raised the ethical concern of source countries’ (which are often developing countries with already-compromised healthcare system) vulnerability. The current paper offers critical insights juxtaposing all these seemingly conflicting ideas and interests within the scope of national and transnational instruments...|$|E

Focusing on the <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> of this horizon scanning assessment, i. e. relapsed or refractory PTCL, two single-arm phase II studies investigating the response of patients to romidepsin were included.

40|$|The New York WORKS {{demonstration}} project {{was designed to}} improve employment outcomes for persons with psychiatric disabilities receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) disability payments. This article shows how the individual characteristics of participants were related to outcomes at each stage of the multistage recruitment process used in the project and how those characteristics contributed to enrollment. The findings are important to program administrators {{who are interested in}} ensuring that SSI recipients receive equal access to employment-related services and who want to improve recruitment strategies for future {{demonstration project}}s. The New York WORKS recruitment process used administrative records from the Social Security Administration (SSA) to identify the population of over 68, 000 SSI recipients with a diagnosis of a psychiatric disability in Erie County and New York City. Staff involved in the project documented the results of each stage of the recruitment process. The New York WORKS project included four stages: (1) the provision of information (sending a letter and information packet); (2) demonstrated awareness of the project (response to a letter containing an overview of the project); (3) expression of interest (<b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>interest</b> in the project, using a postmarked form returned to New York WORKS project staff); and (4) participation (actual enrollment in the program). The project staff members were also able to identify data from administrative records that described the characteristics of the population, including age, sex, type of psychiatric diagnosis, the number of months that the person collected benefits before the recruitment process, employment experience before the recruitment process, and annual earnings in the year before the recruitment process. The data on outcomes at each stage of the recruitment process and the characteristics of SSI recipients were analyzed using an empirical method recently suggested by Heckman and Smith. The analysis identified the relationship between the characteristics of SSI recipients and the outcomes at each stage of the recruitment process and demonstrated how those characteristics contributed to the overall likelihood of enrollment.

Predmet istraživanja su australski Hrvati i Katolička crkva kao značajna nositeljica očuvanja hrvatskoga identiteta u državi New South Wales u Australiji u prošlosti i sadašnjosti. Također, nastojat će se istražiti i prikazati u kojoj je mjeri u različitim povijesnim razdobljima Katolička crkva, te kroz koje oblike društvene i kulturne aktivnosti, uspjela njegovati i sačuvati hrvatski etnički identitet kod starije i mlađe generacije australskih Hrvata. Vremenski period je određen od početka doseljavanja Hrvata na područje New South Walesa do danas. Istraživanje se bazira na dostupnoj hrvatskoj i anglosaksonskoj literaturi, razgovorima s predstavnicima i konzumentima Katoličke crkve na području države New South Wales 2003. i 2009. godine, predstavnicima mlađe i starije generacije hrvatskih iseljenika, analizi pitanja koja se odnose na Katoličku crkvu iz anketnog upitnika iz 2003. godine, dosadašnjim istraživanjima, analizi novinskih članaka, informacijama dobivenim iz Veleposlanstva Republike Hrvatske u Canberri, kao i na podatcima prikupljenim putem interneta.

The importance {{of the size of the}} space and infrastructure for various purposes, primarily for religious, but also for social, sporting and fun gatherings that the Church offers to all interest and age group of Croatian immigrants of particular importance for all generations of emigrants. Particular merit in the preservation of Croatian identity belongs to the priests and nuns who are the vast majority of their time available for displaced Croats living in all times and situations. Interesting and analyzed the results of research conducted 2003 in New South Wales on a sample of 75 persons younger age. Of the total of 100 % respondents, 82 % of people under the age goes up to the Croatian church once a week, which is indeed commendable and proves that the younger generations of Australian Croatians interested in the activities offered by Croatian Catholic Center. Also, survey results showed that the younger generation of Croatian immigrants in various sectors including Croatian organizations in New South Wales, 97 % of respondents from a total of 100 % included in the work of a Croatian association, club or church.
