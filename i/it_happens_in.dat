25|$|Chloroplasts alone make {{almost all}} of a plant cell's amino acids in their stroma except the sulfur-containing ones like {{cysteine}} and methionine. Cysteine {{is made in the}} chloroplast (the proplastid too) but it is also synthesized in the cytosol and mitochondria, probably because it has trouble crossing membranes to get to where it is needed. The chloroplast is known to make the precursors to methionine but it is unclear whether the organelle carries out the last leg of the pathway or if <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> the cytosol.|$|E
25|$|In {{the absence}} of CPG, control by brain as <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> {{complete}} spinal cord injury, sensory feedback {{is very important in}} generating rhythmic locomotion. Firstly, locomotor movements can be initiated or blocked by some proprioceptive afferent inputs. Other work confirmed the importance of hip afferents for locomotor rhythm generation since flexion of the hip will abolish the rhythm whereas extension will enhance it. Secondly, proprioceptive afferents may participate in adapting walking speed, in determining overall cycle duration, and in regulating the structure of the step cycle’s subphases (i.e., swing, stance), which is required for speed adaptation and interlimb coupling. Thirdly, proprioceptive afferents are involved in setting the level of muscle activity through various reflex pathways.|$|E
25|$|For example, {{calculating the}} FRF for a massndash&springndash&damper {{system with a}} mass of 1nbsp&kg, spring {{stiffness}} of 1.93nbsp&N/mm and a damping ratio of 0.1. The values of the spring and mass give a natural frequency of 7nbsp&Hz for this specific system. Applying the 1nbsp&Hz square wave from earlier allows the calculation of the predicted vibration of the mass. The figure illustrates the resulting vibration. <b>It</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> this example that the fourth harmonic of the square wave falls at 7nbsp&Hz. The frequency response of the massndash&springndash&damper therefore outputs a high 7nbsp&Hz vibration even though the input force had a relatively low 7nbsp&Hz harmonic. This example highlights that the resulting vibration is dependent on both the forcing function and the system that the force is applied to.|$|E

2500|$|Operant {{behavior}} {{is said to}} be [...] "emitted"; that is, initially it is not elicited by any particular stimulus. Thus one may ask why <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>in</b> the first place. [...] The answer to this question is like Darwin's {{answer to the question of}} the origin of a [...] "new" [...] bodily structure, namely, variation and selection. Similarly, the behavior of an individual varies from moment to moment, in such aspects as the specific motions involved, the amount of force applied, or the timing of the response. Variations that lead to reinforcement are strengthened, and if reinforcement is consistent, the behavior tends to remain stable. However, behavioral variability can itself be altered through the manipulation of certain variables.|$|E
