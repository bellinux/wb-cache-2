2500|$|Cognitive bias {{research}} {{has suggested that}} people are susceptible to illusions of PK. These include both the illusion that they themselves have the power, and that the events they witness are real demonstrations of PK. For example, the illusion of control is an <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> between intention and external events, and believers in the paranormal {{have been shown to be}} more susceptible to this illusion than others. Psychologist Thomas Gilovich explains this as a biased interpretation of personal experience. For example, someone in a dice game wishing for a high score [...] can interpret high numbers as [...] "success" [...] and low numbers as [...] "not enough concentration." [...] Bias towards belief in PK may be an example of the human tendency to see patterns where none exist, called the clustering illusion, which believers are also more susceptible to.|$|E
50|$|Most {{explanations}} for <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> involve psychological heuristics: information processing short-cuts that underlie many human judgments. One {{of these is}} availability: {{the ease with which}} an idea comes to mind. Availability is often used to estimate how likely an event is or how often it occurs. This can result in <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation,</b> because some pairings can come easily and vividly to mind even though they are not especially frequent.|$|E

50|$|In an {{experimental}} study done by Eder, Fiedler and Hamm-Eder (2011), {{the effects of}} working-memory capacity on <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> were investigated. They first looked at the individual differences in working memory, and then looked {{to see if that}} had any effect on the formation of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b> They found that individuals with higher working memory capacity viewed minority group members more positively than individuals with lower working memory capacity. In a second experiment, the authors looked into the effects of memory load in working memory on <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b> They found that increased memory load in working memory led to an increase in the prevalence of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b> The experiment was designed to specifically test working memory and not substantial stimulus memory. This means that the development of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> was caused by deficiencies in central cognitive resources caused by the load in working memory, not selective recall.|$|R
50|$|Berndsen et al. (1999) {{wanted to}} {{determine}} if the structure of testing for <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> could lead to the formation of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b> The hypothesis was that identifying test variables as Group A and Group B might be causing the participants to look for differences between the groups, resulting in the creation of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b> An experiment was set up where one set of participants were told the groups were Group A and Group B, while another set of participants were given groups labeled as students who graduated in 1993 or 1994.

50|$|A {{study also}} found that {{children}} create illusory correlations. In their experiment, children in grades 1, 3, 5, and 7, and adults all looked at the same <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> paradigm. The study found that children did create significant illusory correlations, but those correlations were weaker than the ones created by adults. In a second study, groups of shapes with different colors were used. The formation of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> persisted showing that social stimuli are not necessary for creating these correlations.|$|E

50|$|Johnson and Jacobs (2003) {{performed}} an experiment {{to see how}} early in life individuals begin forming illusory correlations.

40|$|Under {{the notion}} of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations,</b> simple {{learning}} paradigms (e. g. Hamilton & Gifford, 1976) {{have been used to}} study the formation of stereotypes that discriminate between majorities and minorities. In the present paper, limitations of this approach in terms of theoretical explanations and empirical evidence are addressed. Theoretically, we propose pseudocontingencies (PCs, Fiedler, Freytag & Meiser, 2008) as a more robust mechanism behind <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b> In contrast to previous explanations, PCs can explain <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> when groups are never paired with valence. Empirically, we replicate earlier findings, i. e. that the more frequently observed group, the majority, is evaluated more in line with the more frequently observed valence. Crucially, we extend the empirical evidence in that <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> prove robust over {{a very large number of}} observations (320) and under increasingly interactive task conditions, involving predictions of valence (Experiment 2) and reinforcement-learning conditions (Experiment 3). The latter provided evidence for <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> on a new measure, participants’ predictions. These predictions reflect the expectations about the valence associated with majority and minority and might well affect real life behavior. The discussion focuses on possible reasons for why PCs are used in stereotypic judgments...|$|R

50|$|In general, {{availability}} {{is correlated}} with ecological frequency, {{but it is}} also affected by other factors.

The phenomenon of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> is explained as an availability bias.|$|E
50|$|In a {{landmark}} study, David Hamilton and Richard Gifford (1976) examined {{the role of}} <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> in stereotype formation. Subjects were instructed to read descriptions of behaviors performed by members of groups A and B. Negative behaviors outnumbered positive actions and group B was smaller than group A, making negative behaviors and membership in group B relatively infrequent and distinctive. Participants were then asked who had performed a set of actions: a person of group A or group B. Results showed that subjects overestimated {{the frequency with which}} both distinctive events, membership in group B and negative behavior, co-occurred, and evaluated group B more negatively. This despite the fact the proportion of positive to negative behaviors was equivalent for both groups {{and that there was no}} actual correlation between group membership and behaviors. Although Hamilton and Gifford found a similar effect for positive behaviors as the infrequent events, a meta-analytic review of studies showed that <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> effects are stronger when the infrequent, distinctive information is negative.|$|E
50|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{stereotypes}} can develop based on a cognitive mechanism known as <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> - an erroneous inference {{about the relationship between}} two events. If two statistically infrequent events co-occur, observers overestimate the frequency of co-occurrence of these events. The underlying reason is that rare, infrequent events are distinctive and salient and, when paired, become even more so. The heightened salience results in more attention and more effective encoding, which strengthens the belief that the events are correlated.|$|E
50|$|Research on {{the role}} of <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> in the {{formation}} of stereotypes suggests that stereotypes can develop because of incorrect inferences about the relationship between two events (e.g., membership in a social group and bad or good attributes). This means that at least some stereotypes are inaccurate.|$|R
50|$|Tversky and Kahneman {{offered the}} {{availability}} heuristic {{as an explanation}} for <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> in which people wrongly judge two events {{to be associated with}} each other.

50|$|Martin Hilbert (2012) proposes an {{information}} processing mechanism that assumes a noisy conversion of objective observations into subjective judgments. The theory defines noise as {{the mixing of}} these observations during retrieval from memory. According to the model, underlying cognitions or subjective judgments are identical with noise or objective observations {{that can lead to}} overconfidence or what is known as conservatism bias—when asked about behavior participants underestimate the majority or larger group and overestimate the minority or smaller group. These results are <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b>|$|R
50|$|People {{also tend}} to {{interpret}} ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties {{are exposed to the}} same evidence), belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations).|$|E
50|$|David Hamilton and Robert Gifford (1976) {{conducted}} {{a series of}} experiments that demonstrated how stereotypic beliefs regarding minorities could derive from <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> processes. To test their hypothesis, Hamilton and Gifford had research participants read a series of sentences describing either desirable or undesirable behaviors, which were attributed to either Group A or Group B. Abstract groups were used so that no previously established stereotypes would influence results. Most of the sentences were associated with Group A, and the remaining few were associated with Group B. The following table summarizes the information given.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> is the {{phenomenon}} of perceiving a relationship between variables (typically people, events, or behaviors) even when no such relationship exists. A common example of this phenomenon is {{the formation of a}} false association between membership in a statistical minority group (e.g., African-Americans) and a rare, typically negative, behavior (e.g., drug abuse). This false association is formed because rare or novel occurrences are more salient and therefore tend to capture one's attention. This is one way stereotypes form and endure.

40|$|People often detect {{structure}} and patterns in data that is random.

A computational analysis of an optimal reasoner’s performance on these three tasks suggests that this difficulty does not arise simply because people have an irrational disposition to see meaning in randomness, but because the underlying inference problem is intrinsically hard – for both statistical inference and human intuition. This analysis suggests that randomly produced data is inherently ambiguous, because data which is randomly produced can often also be produced by a systematic process. An experiment is reported which provides evidence that inferences about randomness are inherently difficult...|$|R
40|$|Connectionist {{modeling}} {{has begun}} {{to have an impact}} on research in social cognition. PDP models have been used to model a broad range of social psychological topics such as person perception, <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations,</b> cognitive dissonance, social categorization and stereotypes. Smith and DeCoster [28] recently proposed a recurrent connectionist model of person perception and stereotyping that accounts for a number of phenomena usually seen as contradictory or difficult to integrate into a single coherent conceptual framework. While their model is based on clearly defined and potentially far-reaching theoretical principles, it nonetheless suffers from certain shortcomings, among them, the use of misleading dependent measures and the incapacity of the network to develop its own internal representations.

50|$|<b>Illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> is the {{tendency}} to see non-existent correlations {{in a set of}} data. This tendency was first demonstrated in a series of experiments in the late 1960s. In one experiment, participants read a set of psychiatric case studies, including responses to the Rorschach inkblot test. The participants reported that the homosexual men in the set {{were more likely to report}} seeing buttocks, anuses or sexually ambiguous figures in the inkblots. In fact the fictional case studies had been constructed so that the homosexual men were no more likely to report this imagery or, in one version of the experiment, were less likely to report it than heterosexual men. In a survey, a group of experienced psychoanalysts reported the same set of illusory associations with homosexuality.|$|E
50|$|The {{research}} of Evelyn Hooker, presented in 1956, {{and the first}} conducted without a polluted sample (gay {{men who had been}} treated for mental illness) dispelled the <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> between homosexuality and mental illness that prior research, conducted with polluted sampling, had established. Hooker presented a team of three expert evaluators with 60 unmarked psychological profiles from her year of research. She chose to leave the interpretation of her results to others, to avoid potential bias. The evaluators concluded that in terms of adjustment, there were no differences between the members of each group. Her demonstration that it is not an illness led the way to the eventual removal of homosexuality from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.|$|E

Black people, for instance, are a minority group in the United States and interaction with blacks is a relatively infrequent event for an average white American. Similarly, undesirable behavior (e.g. crime) is statistically less frequent than desirable behavior. Since both events [...] "blackness" [...] and [...] "undesirable behavior" [...] are distinctive {{in the sense that}} they are infrequent, the combination of the two leads observers to overestimate the rate of co-occurrence. Similarly, in workplaces where women are underrepresented and negative behaviors such as errors occur less frequently than positive behaviors, women become more strongly associated with mistakes than men.|$|R
40|$|The {{main idea}} of the article is to {{consider}} the interdependence between Politics of Memory (as a type of narrating the Past) and Stereotyping. The author suggests that, {{in a time of}} information revolution, we are still constructing images of others on the basis of simplification, overestimation of association between features, and <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations,</b> instead of basing them on knowledge and personal contact. The Politics of Memory, national remembrance, and the historical consciousness {{play a significant role in}} these processes, because – as the author argues – they transform historically based 'symbolic analogies' into 'illusory correlations' between national identity and the behavior of its members. To support his theoretical investigation, the author presents results of his draft experiment and two case studies: (a) a social construction of images of neighbors based on Polish narrations about the Past; and (b) various processes of stereotyping based on the Remembrance of the Holocaust. All these considerations lead him to state that the Politics of Memory should be recognized as an influential source of commonly shared stereotypes on other cultures and nations...|$|R
50|$|Two studies {{performed}} by Ratliff and Nosek examined {{whether or not}} explicit and implicit attitudes affected <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b> In one study, Ratliff and Nosek had two groups: one a majority {{and the other a}} minority. They then had three groups of participants, all with readings about the two groups. One group of participants received overwhelming pro-majority readings, one was given pro-minority readings, and one received neutral readings. The groups that had pro-majority and pro-minority readings favored their respective pro groups both explicitly and implicitly. The group that had neutral readings favored the majority explicitly, but not implicitly. The second study was similar, but instead of readings, pictures of behaviors were shown, and the participants wrote a sentence describing the behavior they saw in the pictures presented. The findings of both studies supported the authors' argument that the differences found between the explicit and implicit attitudes {{is a result of the}} interpretation of the covariation and making judgments based on these interpretations (explicit) instead of just accounting for the covariation (implicit).|$|R
50|$|In the {{original}} Tversky and Kahneman (1973) research, three major {{factors that are}} discussed are the frequency of repetition, frequency of co-occurrence, and <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation.</b> The use of frequency of repetition aids in the retrieval of relevant instances. The idea behind this phenomenon, {{is that the more}} an instance is repeated within a category or list, the stronger the link between the two instances becomes. Individuals then use the strong association between the instances to determine the frequency of an instance. Consequently, the association between the category or list and the specific instance, often influences frequency judgements. Frequency of co-occurrence strongly relates to Frequency of repetition, such that the more an item-pair is repeated, the stronger the association between the two items becomes, leading to a bias when estimating frequency of co-occurrence. Due to the phenomena of frequency of co-occurrence, Illusory correlations also often play a big role.|$|E
50|$|Confirmation bias is the {{tendency}} to search for, interpret, favor, and recall information {{in a way that}} confirms one's beliefs or hypotheses while giving disproportionately less attention to information that contradicts it. The effect is stronger for emotionally charged issues and for deeply entrenched beliefs. People also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position. Biased search, interpretation and memory have been invoked to explain attitude polarization (when a disagreement becomes more extreme even though the different parties are exposed to the same evidence), belief perseverance (when beliefs persist after the evidence for them is shown to be false), the irrational primacy effect (a greater reliance on information encountered early in a series) and <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation</b> (when people falsely perceive an association between two events or situations). Confirmation biases contribute to overconfidence in personal beliefs and can maintain or strengthen beliefs in the face of contrary evidence. Poor decisions due to these biases have been found in political and organizational contexts.|$|E
50|$|Chapman (1967) {{described}} a {{bias in the}} judgment of the frequency with which two events co-occur. This demonstration showed that the co-occurrence of paired stimuli resulted in participants overestimating the frequency of the pairings. To test this idea, participants were given information about several hypothetical mental patients. The data for each patient consisted of a clinical diagnosis and a drawing made by the patient. Later, participants estimated the frequency with which each diagnosis had been accompanied by various features of the drawing. The subjects vastly overestimated the frequency of this co-occurrence (such as suspiciousness and peculiar eyes). This effect was labeled the <b>illusory</b> <b>correlation.</b> Tversky and Kahneman suggested that availability provides a natural account for the illusory-correlation effect. The strength of the association between two events could provide the basis for the judgment of how frequently the two events co-occur. When the association is strong, it becomes more likely to conclude that the events have been paired frequently. Strong associations will be thought of as having occurred together frequently.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "experiment" [...] usually {{implies a}} {{controlled}} experiment, but sometimes controlled experiments are prohibitively difficult or impossible. In this case researchers resort to natural experiments or quasi-experiments. [...] Natural experiments {{rely solely on}} observations of the variables of the system under study, rather than manipulation of just {{one or a few}} variables as occurs in controlled experiments. To the degree possible, they attempt to collect data for the system {{in such a way that}} contribution from all variables can be determined, and where the effects of variation in certain variables remain approximately constant so that the effects of other variables can be discerned. The degree to which this is possible depends on the observed correlation between explanatory variables in the observed data. When these variables are not well correlated, natural experiments can approach the power of controlled experiments. Usually, however, there is some correlation between these variables, which reduces the reliability of natural experiments relative to what could be concluded if a controlled experiment were performed. Also, because natural experiments usually take place in uncontrolled environments, variables from undetected sources are neither measured nor held constant, and these may produce <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> in variables under study.|$|R
40|$|Background: Psychotherapies for {{psychosis}} typically aim {{to develop}} {{an awareness of the}} implausible content of a delusion or target the underlying cognitive biases (i. e., problematic thinking styles, such as hasty decisions and illusory control) that foster and maintain delusional beliefs. A recently designed individual-based treatment entitled metacognitive therapy (MCT+) combines these two approaches. Emerging evidence suggests individualised MCT+, when used concurrently with antipsychotic medication, may be an effective psychological treatment for reducing delusional symptoms. However, it remains to be tested whether MCT+ can be effective in patients with active delusions who are not currently receiving psychotropic drugs. Method: We present two cases (one patient with schizophrenia and the other with delusional disorder) experiencing active delusions who underwent four-weeks of intensive MCT+, without concurrent antipsychotic medication (minimum 6 -months unmedicated). Baseline and 6 -week follow-up data are presented on a variety of measures assessing delusion symptom severity (i. e., PANSS, PSYRATS, SAPS), clinical insight, and cognitive bias propensity. Results: After 4 -weeks of MCT+, both patients showed substantial reduction in delusional symptoms, reported improved clinical insight, and were less prone to making <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations.</b> Conclusions: The presented case studies provide preliminary evidence for the feasibility of MCT+ in treating patients not taking, or resistant to, antipsychotic medication...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there has}} been a renewed {{interest}} in the investigation of the specific features that characterize people who endorse different ideologies (e. g., Carney et al., 2008). For instance, research has pointed out that conservatives and liberals emerge as very distinct groups, not only for personal opinions, personality and cognitive style (Jost et al., 2009), but also for deeper mechanisms. For instance, conservatives (vs. liberals) display an automatic selective attention for negative (vs. positive) stimuli (Carraro et al., 2011) and this seems to have important social consequences. For instance, conservatives tend to more easily form <b>illusory</b> <b>correlations</b> between negative information and minority groups (Castelli & Carraro, 2011; Carraro et al., 2013). In the present research in two studies, we further explored the likely consequences of this attentional asymmetry in attitude formation and change processes toward moral and immoral persons. Participants were initially (phase 1) presented with moral (vs. immoral, between participants) behaviors performed by a person. Then, implicit (IAT; Greenwald et al., 1998) and explicit attitudes toward that person were detected. Subsequently (phase 2), participants were presented with counter-attitudinal information regarding the same person, and then implicit and explicit attitudes were detected again. Overall, conservatives demonstrated a higher tendency to change their implicit attitudes when negative information was presented as second information. That is in line with the idea that conservatives weight more negative than positive information and thus {{they are more likely to}} change their opinion about a moral person but they are less likely to change their opinion about an immoral person...|$|R
