We have been able to qualitatively identify the presence of nonlinearity and chaos in the time series of the foreign exchange rates for US/EURO (United States <b>dollar</b> to <b>Euro</b> <b>Dollar)</b> and US/UK (United States dolar to United Kingdom Pound) currencies. Interestingly we find that for the US-INDIA (United States dollar to Indian Rupee) foreign exchange rates, no such chaotic dynamics is observed.

40|$|This study evaluates {{substitution}} of foreign currency balances in Estonia, a transition economy neighbouring countries participating in EMU. The {{focus is on}} substitution between <b>dollar</b> and <b>euro</b> balances in the three basic functions of money – unit of account, store of value and means of payment. While traditional models for currency substitution concentrate on substitution between a domestic currency and aggregate foreign currency balances, we look for substitution between the <b>dollar</b> and the <b>euro</b> or euro-related foreign currency balances. We find substitution between dollarization and euroization to be asymmetric in the short run, which suggests that inertia, irreversibility and ratchet effects favour the euro. No significant evidence of asymmetries {{in the long run}} was detected. In general, the traditional model for currency substitution explains the dynamics of the <b>euro</b> and <b>dollar</b> as substitute foreign currencies. <b>euro,</b> <b>dollar,</b> currency substitution, currency demand...|$|R

40|$|The paper asks two questions. One, what is {{the size}} of the effect of the {{increase}} in real oil price on competitiveness of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries –the real exchange rate is a measure of competitiveness – and two, given recent concerns about the sliding greenback and the consequent income and inflationary problems, would the GCC countries been “better off” had they pegged their currencies to the <b>Euro</b> <b>dollar</b> in 1991 ? To answer these questions we model and estimate the effect of oil prices on the competitiveness for the GCC then we provide a test statistic to test whether the conditional variance of the model has remained stable under the US dollar peg compared to a counterfactual scenario, where the GCC countries peg their currencies to the <b>Euro</b> <b>dollar</b> in 1991. We find the effect of the increase in the real price of oil on competitiveness of the GCC countries to be small, most of the domestic inflation is imported, {{and that there is a}} relatively large variation among the GCC economies with respect to the currency peg. The financial problems the GCC countries face today are not about which currency (or a basket of currencies) they should peg to, but rather about the choice of the monetary arrangement as a whole. ...|$|R
