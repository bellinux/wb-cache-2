500|$|Franco did {{extensive}} research for his role. He {{went from being}} a non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, but has since quit the habit. He learned how to ride a motorcycle, play guitar, as well as the conga and bongo drums. The actor also carefully studied Dean's mannerisms by watching his three films (East of Eden, Rebel Without a Cause and Giant). Franco also read numerous biographies on Dean's life. The actor also took advice from some of Dean's closest friends, including Martin Landau, Dennis Hopper, Liz Sheridan (Dean's former girlfriend) and Leonard Rosenman. [...] "Martin was the most informative person that I spoke to. <b>He</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> tremendously with James's physical mannerisms," [...] Franco reflected. [...] "I isolated myself a lot during the filming. I did this because I think he had a pervasive loneliness throughout his life and I wanted to feel what that felt like. Not talking to my family or loved ones had quite an emotional effect on me." ...|$|E
500|$|On May 1, 1991, Henderson {{stole his}} 939th base to pass Lou Brock {{and became the}} sport's all-time stolen base leader. Henderson's speech (at right) after {{breaking}} Brock's record {{was similar to the}} standard victory or award speech. He thanked God and his mother, as well as the people that helped him in baseball. Because his idol was Muhammad Ali, Henderson decided to use the words [...] "greatest of all time." [...] These words have since been taken by many to support the notion that Henderson is selfish and arrogant, although years later, Henderson revealed that he had gone over his planned remarks ahead of time with Brock, and the Cardinals Hall of Famer [...] "had no problem with it. In fact, <b>he</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> write what I was going to say that day." [...] On the day of the speech, Brock later told reporters amiably, [...] "He spoke from his heart." [...] Brock and Henderson had had a friendly relationship ever since their first meeting in 1981. Brock pronounced the young speedster as the heir to his record, saying, [...] "How are we gonna break it?" ...|$|E

500|$|... ‘How can I hit back?’ Pitre asked. ‘Roberts, {{he is very}} polite, very nice. Each time I fall, <b>he</b> <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> get up and apologizes {{and says}} it is an {{accident}} ... can I hit {{a man who is}} apologizing to me? No, never, it is not done......’' ...|$|R
2500|$|Bhagavan Das was {{introduced}} to Baba Hari Dass in Nainital, Hanuman Garhi (the Fortress of Hanuman, [...] ) Bhagavan Dass described that experience: [...] "Hari Das was the real thing, a cave yogi", and, [...] "I showed Hari Dass Baba how I did these kriyas, and <b>he</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> perfect my technique".|$|E
2500|$|One of {{his contemporaries}} at Watford was future Norwich manager, Glenn Roeder. Roberts remembers Roeder as [...] "an {{absolute}} gentleman... I can't speak highly enough of him. <b>He</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> a great deal with his experience and any problems that the young lads had they knew he would help them with." [...] He scored nine goals in 63 games for the Hornets before moving to Huddersfield Town {{prior to the start}} of the 1990–91 season.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} ambitious as Lucas {{wanted to create}} fresh prop prototypes and sets (based on McQuarrie's paintings) {{that had never been}} {{realized}} before in science fiction films. He commissioned production designers John Barry and Roger Christian, who were working on the sets of the film Lucky Lady (1975) when Lucas first approached them, to work on the production sets. Christian recounted in 2014: [...] "George came to the set I was doing, it was an old salt factory design and <b>he</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> shovel salt, just like two students in plaid shirts and sneakers. And we spoke and he looked at the set and couldn't believe it wasn't real." [...] They had a conversation with Lucas on what he would like the film to appear like, with them creating the desired sets. Christian said that Lucas [...] "didn't want anything [...] to stand out, he wanted it [...] all real and used. And I said, 'Finally somebody's doing it the right way.'" ...|$|E

"These poor persecuted Scotch Covenanters," [...] said I to my inquiring Frenchman, in such stinted French as {{stood at}} command, [...] "ils s'en appelaient à"--"A la Postérité," [...] {{interrupted}} <b>he,</b> <b>helping</b> <b>me</b> out.--"Ah, Monsieur, non, mille fois non!

6000|$|... "There {{was the old}} party what {{engaged me}} a waitin' in the 'ouse at Purfleet. <b>He</b> <b>'elped</b> <b>me</b> to lift the boxes {{and put them in}} the dray.

2500|$|Standing five foot, nine {{inches tall}} and {{weighing}} 170 pounds, Loob arrived in Calgary facing skepticism {{that he would be}} able to withstand the rougher North American game and smaller ice surface compared to what he was used to in the Elitserien. Opinion around the NHL in the early 1980s was that Swedish players were [...] "soft"; teammate Colin Patterson credited Loob with changing that perception. [...] He was a vocal leader, unafraid to speak to his teammates when he felt it necessary. [...] He was a strong skater with [...] "dazzling technique", and former Calgary linemate Joe Nieuwendyk said Loob was a key reason for his own early success in the NHL: [...] "He just had such a great amount of skill. He could do things none of the rest of us could. The luckiest thing that happened to me was getting put on Hakan Loob’s line my first full year in Calgary. <b>He</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> so much, starting my career the right way. A big reason why I scored 50." [...] Nieuwendyk added that Loob could [...] "put pucks into areas, make plays, nobody else would dream of".|$|E

6000|$|As {{she sat up}} in {{the grass}} and looked about her, a bark startled her.

He is good, Madamoiselle, never fear. <b>He</b> <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> keep the cows." ...|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> to stagger to my feet, {{and pushed}} me gently into the easy chair. The match burnt out, and he quietly struck another {{and looked around}} the room for a candle or lamp. It was a vain search, for I had neither.|$|E
