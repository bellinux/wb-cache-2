50|$|<b>Deploying</b> to {{production}} {{is the most}} sensitive step; it may be done by <b>deploying</b> new code directly (overwriting old code, so only one copy is present at a time), or by <b>deploying</b> a configuration change. This can take various forms: <b>deploying</b> a parallel installation of {{a new version of}} code, and switching between them with a configuration change; <b>deploying</b> a new version of code with the old behavior and a feature flag, and switching to the new behavior with a configuration change that performs a flag flip; or by <b>deploying</b> separate servers (one running the old code, one the new) and redirecting traffic from old to new with a configuration change at the traffic routing level. These in turn may be done all at once or gradually, in phases.|$|R
50|$|The basic {{air defence}} unit is {{typically}} a battery with 2 to 12 guns or missile launchers and fire control elements.

40|$|Distributed virtual honeynet is an {{important}} security detection system to Worms, Botnet detection, Spam and Distributed Denial-Of-Service. The honeynet value significantly relies on the disguise capacity. The traditional <b>deploying</b> method is a static scheme that the configuration of honeynet is determined by security experts beforehand and unable to change after the deployment. The hackers or Botnet controllers identify the honeynet and may not trap into the same honeynet again. Therefore, the static <b>deploying</b> honeynet has relatively poor disguise capacity. To improve the disguise capacity, a novel dynamic <b>deploying</b> method is proposed {{that is capable of}} redeploying the honeynet in real time. The inducing degree is introduced to measure the disguise capacity by analyzing the inbound and outbound packets of the honeynet. When the inducing degree is less than a specific threshold, the dynamic <b>deploying</b> manager will be activated and to execuate the dynamic <b>deploying</b> algorithms. We have developed three novel dynamic <b>deploying</b> algorithms to solve the problem how to redeploy the honeynet and implemented a prototype for distributed virtual honeynet based on Honeyd. The experimental results of the simulation and real networks datasets demonstrate that the dynamic <b>deploying</b> approach is effective to enhance the disguise capacity of honeynet...|$|R
