40|$|Feeding is an {{essential}} behavior for animals to sustain their lives. Over the past several decades, many neuropeptides that regulate feeding behavior {{have been identified in}} vertebrates. These neuropeptides are called feeding regulatory neuropeptides. There have been numerous studies on the role of feeding regulatory neuropeptides in vertebrates including birds. Some feeding regulatory neuropeptides show different effects on feeding behavior between birds and other vertebrates, particularly mammals. The difference is marked with orexigenic neuropeptides. For example, melanin-concentrating hormone, orexin, and motilin, which are regarded as orexigenic neuropeptides in mammals, have no effect on feeding behavior in birds. Furthermore, ghrelin and growth hormone-releasing hormone, which are also known as orexigenic neuropeptides in mammals, suppress feeding behavior in birds. Thus, {{it is likely that the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>regulator</b> mechanism has changed during the evolution of vertebrates. This review summarizes the recent knowledge of peptidergic feeding regulatory factors in birds and discusses the difference in their action between birds and other vertebrates...|$|R

From 1873 to 1891 Theodore submitted some half a dozen patents, including improvements in hose and pipe couplings, <b>feed</b> water <b>regulators,</b> and steam engines. Two patents were assigned to his brother Charles, {{who seems to have}} remained affiliated with the fire engine business even after it was sold to other parties.|$|R
40|$|The {{hormonal}} {{regulation of}} feeding behaviour {{is well known}} in vertebrates, whereas it remains poorly understood in insects. Here, we report that the takeout gene is an essential component of nutritional homeostasis in Drosophila. takeout encodes a putative juvenile hormone (JH) binding protein and {{has been described as a}} link between circadian rhythm and feeding behaviour. However, the physiological role of takeout and its putative link to JH remain unknown. In this study, we show that takeout (to(1)) flies failed to adapt their food intake according to food availability and that most defects could be genetically rescued. When food is abundant, to(1) are hyperphagic, yielding to hypertrophy of the fat body. When food reappears after a starvation period, to(1) flies do not increase their food intake as much as wild-type flies. This defect in food intake regulation is partly based on the action of Takeout on taste neurons, because the sensitivity of to(1) gustatory neurons to sugars does not increase after starvation, as in wild-type neurons. This lack of regulation is also evident at the locomotor activity, which normally increases during starvation, a behaviour related to food foraging. In addition, to(1) flies lack sexual dimorphism of locomotor activity, which has previously been linked to the JH circulating level. Moreover, application of the JH analog methoprene rescues the phenotype. These results suggest that takeout plays a central role as a <b>feeding</b> <b>regulator</b> and may act by modulating the circulating JH level...|$|R
50|$|The major {{components}} of a rocket engine are therefore the combustion chamber (thrust chamber), pyrotechnic igniter, propellant <b>feed</b> system, valves, <b>regulators,</b> the propellant tanks, and the rocket engine nozzle. In terms of feeding propellants to the combustion chamber, liquid-propellant engines are either pressure-fed or pump-fed, and pump-fed engines work in either a gas-generator cycle, a staged-combustion cycle, or an expander cycle.|$|R
40|$|Treatment {{with second}} {{generation}} antipsychotics (SGAs), notably olanzapine and clozapine, causes severe obesity side effects. Antagonism of histamine H 1 receptors {{has been identified}} as a main cause of SGA-induced obesity, but the molecular mechanisms associated with this antagonism in different stages of SGA-induced weight gain remain unclear. This review aims to explore the potential role of hypothalamic histamine H 1 receptors in different stages of SGA-induced weight gain/obesity and the molecular pathways related to SGA-induced antagonism of these receptors. Initial data have demonstrated the importance of hypothalamic H 1 receptors in both short- and long-term SGA-induced obesity. Blocking hypothalamic H 1 receptors by SGAs activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a well-known <b>feeding</b> <b>regulator.</b> During short-term treatment, hypothalamic H 1 receptor antagonism by SGAs may activate the AMPK—carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 signaling to rapidly increase caloric intake and result in weight gain. During long-term SGA treatment, hypothalamic H 1 receptor antagonism can reduce thermogenesis, possibly by inhibiting the sympathetic outflows to the brainstem rostral raphe pallidus and rostral ventrolateral medulla, therefore decreasing brown adipose tissue thermogenesis. Additionally, blocking of hypothalamic H 1 receptors by SGAs may also contribute to fat accumulation by decreasing lipolysis but increasing lipogenesis in white adipose tissue. In summary, antagonism of hypothalamic H 1 receptors by SGAs may time-dependently affect the hypothalamus-brainstem circuits to cause weight gain by stimulating appetite and fat accumulation but reducing energy expenditure. The H 1 receptor and its downstream signaling molecules could be valuable targets for the design of new compounds for treating SGA-induced weight gain/obesity...|$|R
2500|$|Due to {{the lack}} of evidence, Irish and Dutch {{investigators}} could not pinpoint a probable cause for the accident. They examined the possibility of a bomb, electrical failure or pilot error, but believed that the most likely possibility was a catastrophic mechanical failure. The cause of the accident is believed to be a malfunctioning overspeeding outboard propeller caused by metal particles obstructing oil <b>feed</b> line <b>regulator</b> valves. [...] The particles may have been formed by a gear that was damaged when the supercharger of the corresponding engine was accelerated (gear ratio shifted). The malfunctions of the propeller pitch might have provoked a flight disturbance and as a consequence the propeller may have sheared off.|$|R
40|$|Understanding how muscle {{contraction}} orchestrates insulin-independent muscle glucose transport may enable {{development of}} hyperglycemia-treating drugs. The prevailing concept implicates Ca 2 + {{as a key}} <b>feed</b> forward <b>regulator</b> of glucose transport with secondary fine-tuning by metabolic feedback signals through proteins such as AMPK. Here, we demonstrate in incubated mouse muscle that Ca 2 + release is neither sufficient nor strictly necessary to increase glucose transport. Rather, the glucose transport response is associated with metabolic feedback signals through AMPK, and mechanical stress-activated signals. Furthermore, artificial stimulation of AMPK combined with passive stretch of muscle is additive and sufficient to elicit the full contraction glucose transport response. These results suggest that ATP-turnover and mechanical stress feedback are sufficient to fully increase glucose transport during muscle contraction, and call for a major reconsideration of the established Ca 2 + centric paradigm...|$|R
40|$|Background: Inadequate {{infection}} control knowledge about enteral feeding (EF) practices among nursing home staff {{may lead to}} contamination of EF systems. Aim: To investigate the effectiveness of an {{infection control}} programme (ICP) on knowledge and practice of EF of nursing home staff, and to explore {{the correlation between the}} ICP and bacterial contamination of the hands of staff and feeding equipment. Methods: Using a quasi-experimental pre-post-test control design, each intervention and control group consisted of 15 residents and 10 staff. EF knowledge and practice were assessed by questionnaire and observation. The intervention group received an ICP. Samples were collected from the hands of staff, enteral <b>feed,</b> flow <b>regulators,</b> <b>feeding</b> tube hubs, and the nasopharynx and gastric fluid of residents, and analysed for total bacterial counts and presence of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) before and after the ICP. Findings: The intervention group showed a significant improvement in knowledge and practice after the ICP (P 104 colony-forming units/mL. Contamination was significantly lower in the post-test samples of the intervention group (P < 0. 05), and remained unchanged in the control group. The mean (± standard deviation) number of MRSA-positive samples decreased from 2. 1 ± 1. 6 to 0. 4 ± 0. 7 (P < 0. 05) in the intervention group. MRSA hand contamination was highly correlated with contamination of regulators, gastric fluid, tube hubs and enteral feed (P < 0. 05), illustrating the close relationship between contaminated feed and poor hand hygiene. Conclusion: An effective ICP can significantly reduce the contamination of enteral feed. The provision of ICPs is strongly recommended in nursing homes.

50|$|The G7a(TI) was {{the last}} naval torpedo of German design to use a wet heat method of propulsion. The torpedo was powered by a steam-engine fed by a mixture of {{compressed}} air and steam. Fuel kerosene was burning in a combustion-chamber, creating steam from fresh water. The torpedo's speed {{was determined by the}} level of pressure (three settings for 30/40/44 kn) from the low-pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>feeding</b> air {{to the bottom of the}} combustion-chamber. The resulting superheated steam powered a four cylinder reciprocating engine, in turn powering a pair of contra-rotating propellers.|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} regulator is called as Chowaki or harmonizing {{system for the}} engine, it actually is a two-stage {{pressure regulator}} with twin pressure-tunable regulation valves. It steps down the pressure of compressed air at 215 - 50 atm (3,000 - 711 psi) in the air chamber to the constant high-pressure air at 10 atm (142 psi). While the air pressure is declining as the torpedo is running under the water, the pressure <b>regulator</b> <b>feeds</b> the constant high-pressure air to the engine intake aspirator and keeps the constant running speed in 43 knots (or 80 km/h, 50 mile/h).|$|R
40|$|Transglutaminase 2 (TG 2) is {{a protein}} {{crosslinking}} enzyme with several additional biochemical functions. Loss of TG 2 in vivo results in impaired phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and altered proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages engulfing apoptotic cells leading to autoimmunity. It {{has been proposed}} that TG 2 acts as an integrin ß(3) coreceptor in the engulfment process, while altered proinflammatory cytokine production {{is related to the}} lack of latent TGFß activation by TG 2 null macrophages. Here we report that TG 2 null macrophages respond to lipopolysaccharide treatment by elevated IL- 6 and TNFa production. Though TGFß has been proposed to act as a <b>feed</b> back <b>regulator</b> of proinflammatory cytokine production in LPS-stimulated macrophages, this phenomenon is not related to the lack of active TGFß production. Instead, in the absence of TG 2 integrin ß(3) maintains an elevated basal Src family kinase activity in macrophages, which leads to enhanced phosphorylation and degradation of the I?Ba. Low basal levels of I?Ba explain the enhanced sensitivity of TG 2 null macrophages to signals that regulate NF-?B. Our data suggest that TG 2 null macrophages bear a proinflammatory phenotype, which might contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of these mice to develop autoimmunity and atherosclerosis...|$|R
25|$|Early scuba divers dived {{without a}} {{buoyancy}} aid. In an emergency {{they had to}} jettison their weights. In the 1960s adjustable buoyancy life jackets (ABLJ) became available, {{which can be used}} to compensate for loss of buoyancy at depth due to compression of the neoprene wetsuit and as a lifejacket that will hold an unconscious diver face-upwards at the surface, and that can be quickly inflated. The first versions were inflated from a small disposable carbon dioxide cylinder, later with a small direct coupled air cylinder. A low-pressure <b>feed</b> from the <b>regulator</b> first-stage to an inflation/deflation valve unit lets the volume of the ABLJ be controlled as a buoyancy aid. In 1971 the stabilizer jacket was introduced by ScubaPro. This class of buoyancy aid is known as a buoyancy control device or buoyancy compensator.|$|R
40|$|Airway {{smooth muscle}} is richly endowed with muscarinic receptors of the M 2 and M 3 subtype. Stimulation of these receptors {{inhibits}} large conductance calcium-activated K+ (BK) channels, a negative <b>feed</b> back <b>regulator,</b> in a pertussis toxinsensitive manner and thus facilitates contraction. The underlying mechanism, however, is unknown. We therefore studied {{the activity of}} bovine trachea BK channels in HEK 293 cells expressing the M 2 or M 3 receptor (M 2 RorM 3 R). In M 2 R- but not M 3 R-expressing cells, maximal effective concentrations of carbamoylcholine (CCh) inhibited whole cell BK currents by 53 %. This M 2 R-induced inhibition was abolished by pertussis toxin treatment or overexpression of the Gβγ scavenger transducin-α. In inside-out patches, direct application of 300 nm purified Gβγ decreased channel open probability by 55 %. The physical interaction of Gβγ with BK channels was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Interestingly, inhibition of phospholipase C as well as protein kinase C activities also reversed the CCh effect but to a smaller (∼ 20 %) extent. Mouse tracheal cells responded similarly to CCh, purified Gβγ and phospholipase C/protein kinase C inhibition as M 2 R-expressing HEK 293 cells. Our results demonstrate that airway M 2 Rs inhibit BK channels by a dual, Gβγ-mediated mechanism, a direct membrane-delimited interaction, and the activation of the phospholipase C/protein kinase C pathway...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObesity {{has reached}} {{epidemic}} proportions, but {{little is known}} about its influence on the intestinal immune system. Here we show that the gut immune system is altered during high-fat diet (HFD) <b>feeding</b> and is a functional <b>regulator</b> of obesity-related insulin resistance (IR) that can be exploited therapeutically. Obesity induces a chronic phenotypic pro-inflammatory shift in bowel lamina propria immune cell populations. Reduction of the gut immune system, using beta 7 integrin-deficient mice (Beta 7 null), decreases HFD-induced IR. Treatment of wild-type HFD C 57 BL/ 6 mice with the local gut anti-inflammatory, 5 -aminosalicylic acid (5 -ASA), reverses bowel inflammation and improves metabolic parameters. These beneficial effects are dependent on adaptive and gut immunity and are associated with reduced gut permeability and endotoxemia, decreased visceral adipose tissue inflammation, and improved antigen-specific tolerance to luminal antigens. Thus, the mucosal immune system affects multiple pathways associated with systemic IR and represents a novel therapeutic target in this disease...|$|R
30|$|The {{growth and}} {{proliferation}} of normal cells are strictly regulated {{to maintain a}} homeostasis of cell number and tissue architecture. However, in tumors, cell growth and proliferation are usually deregulated, and sustained cell proliferation {{is one of the}} most common traits of cancer cells. Cancer cells have several ways to obtain the ability to proliferate and replicate rapidly. One mechanism is that they can autocrine or paracrine growth factors which will further activate the mitogenic signaling pathways (Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010). In HCC, cell growth factors such as IGF, FGF were reported to be overexpressed in a way of autocrine or paracrine and further promote cell growth and proliferation (Kim et al., 1998; Yoshiji et al., 2002). Growth factor receptors are usually overexpressed or mutated in tumor cells, which results in persistent activation of downstream mitogenic signals. In HCC, the overexpression of HGF receptor c-Met can activate the downstream Ras/Raf/MEK signaling pathway (Ueki et al., 1997). Overexpression of the Frizzled- 7 receptor leads to the activation of Wnt/beta-caternin signaling pathway in HCC (Merle et al., 2004). In addition to direct overexpressing growth factors and receptors, cancer cells can also activate the mitogenic pathways through affecting the upstream and downstream signal transducers or disruption of the negative feed back loop. For example, the oncogenic signal transducer BRAF is frequently mutated and consistently activated in HCC (Colombino et al., 2012); loss of function mutation of PTEN, which is the negative <b>feed</b> back <b>regulator</b> of PI 3 K/AKT pathway, was also frequently observed in HCC patients (Yao et al., 1999).|$|R
40|$|In this study, using {{transcriptional}} profiling of key tissues, we {{aimed to}} identify genetic mechanisms differing between control pigs and pigs {{that have been}} under selection for low residual feed intake (RFI) for three generations. A further aim {{was to determine the}} pathways responding to feed restriction within these lines and any line x treatment interactions resulting in gene expression differences. Preliminary results indicate that 2, 809 genes in fat (p 3 ̆c 0. 04, q 3 ̆c 0. 2) and 61 genes in liver (p 3 ̆c 0. 001, q 3 ̆c 0. 2) showed differential expression in response to feed restriction. Also, 1, 247 genes (p 3 ̆c 0. 02, q 3 ̆c 0. 2) showed differential expression between low RFI and control pigs and 38 genes (p 3 ̆c 0. 001, q 3 ̆c 0. 2) showed a line x feed interaction in liver. In addition, we measured the concentration of some of the important <b>feed</b> intake <b>regulators</b> in the blood such as leptin, triglyceride, and glucose. We found that the average blood leptin level to be significantly higher in the control ad libitum (CA) pigs than the control restricted (CR) group. Interestingly, the selected line of pigs on both restricted (SR) and ad libitum (SA) feed had similar blood leptin levels as found in the CR group pigs. Serum glucose levels were higher in CR than CA, however, we observed an opposite trend in the selected group. Combined with the transcriptional profiling results, blood hormone parameters may help us understand potential pathways that control FI and FE in pigs...|$|R

40|$|Formative cell {{divisions}} utilizing precise rotations of {{cell division}} planes generate and spatially place asymmetric daughters to produce different cell layers. Therefore, by shaping tissues and organs, formative cell divisions dictate multicellular morphogenesis. In animal formative cell divisions, {{the orientation of}} the mitotic spindle and cell division planes relies on intrinsic and extrinsic cortical polarity cues. Plants lack known key players from animals, and cell division planes are determined prior to the mitotic spindle stage. Therefore, it appears that plants have evolved specialized mechanisms to execute formative cell divisions. Despite their profound influence on plant architecture, molecular players and cellular mechanisms regulating formative divisions in plants are not well understood. This is because formative cell divisions in plants have been difficult to track owing to their submerged positions and imprecise timings of occurrence. However, by identifying a spatiotemporally inducible cell division plane switch system applicable for advanced microscopy techniques, recent studies have begun to uncover molecular modules and mechanisms for formative cell divisions. The identified molecular modules comprise developmentally triggered transcriptional cascades <b>feeding</b> onto microtubule <b>regulators</b> that now allow dissection of the hierarchy of the events at better spatiotemporal resolutions. Here, we survey the current advances in understanding of formative cell divisions in plants in the context of embryogenesis, stem cell functionality and post-embryonic organ formation...|$|R
40|$|Results from {{experiments}} on laboratory scale fedbatch processes {{are presented as}} well as analysis and design of the control system. The main reason for control is to track the drastic growth in feed demand during a cultivation. Variations in the amount {{and quality of the}} inocculum makes precalculated dosage schemes of limited value to obtain reproducible cultivation conditions. Two processes have been studied on a laboratory scale, production of bakers' yeast, and production of the enzyme salicylate hydroxylase using a strain of bacteria. Direct measurement was used to monitor the <b>feed</b> demand. A <b>regulator</b> structure is proposed based on an observer for the exponentially growing feed demand. It {{can be viewed as a}} modified PID regulator around a dosage scheme, but it is less sensitive to errors in the dosage scheme than conventional PID control. The a priori knowledge of the feed profile is further relaxed by introduction of adaptation of the growth rate parameter. The obtained non-linear control system has a simple structure and stability is garanteed for a wide range of initial values using the technique of Liapunov function. The linearized system is analysed in the frequency domain and the adaptation is shown to have negligible influence on the loop phase margin. The adaptive regulator is tested in simulation against real feed profiles and shows good results...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{estradiol}} 17 β (E 2) on adipose tissue metabolism and feed intake was studied in five trials. In trial 1, {{the relationship of}} feed intake and E 2 in plasma were characterized in twin-bearing ewes (n = 10) during late gestation and during lactation. Feed intake decreased 1. 8 -fold from 60 d prepartum to parturition as E 2 in plasma increased 3 -fold. Feed intake increased 2. 8 -fold during the first 30 d of lactation when E 2 in plasma was 13 -fold lower than {{the last week of}} gestation. In trial 2, feed intake was determined (30 d) in ovariectomized ewes implanted with (n = 9) E 2 to attain concentrations of E 2 indicative of late gestation or a sham implant (n = 9). Intake decreased transiently in ewes implanted with E 2. Trials 1 and 2 indicated E 2 was a potential <b>feed</b> intake <b>regulator</b> during late gestation. In trial 3, subcutaneous adipose tissue was biopsied from thirteen twin-bearing ewes to characterize lipid metabolism during - 30, - 15, 0, 15 and 30 d relative to parturition. De novo lipogenesis and palmitate esterification decreased as non-esterified fatty acid and glycerol release (lipolysis) increased during late gestation. During lactation lipogenesis and esterification increased while lipolysis decreased. In trial 4, the interaction of body condition and E 2 on lipid metabolism was evaluated in lean (68 kg) and obese (87 kg) ovariectomized ewes receiving implants containing E 2 or sham implants. Biopsies of subcutaneous adipose tissue were taken at 0, 5 and 30 d post-implantation to determine lipogenesis, esterification and lipolysis. Lipogenesis was inhibited in ewes implanted with E 2 as compared to ewes without E 2. Lean ewes without E 2 had higher rates of lipogenesis over time than obese ewes without E 2. Esterification increased in lean but decreased in obese ewes without E 2. Slices of adipose tissues were cultured (48 h) to evaluate the effect of E 2 on lipid metabolism. Lipogenesis and esterification were decreased by E 2 in the culture. Lipolysis in trials 4 and 5 had little or highly variable responses to E 2. These data indicated increased concentrations of E 2 in plasma during late gestation may directly effect energy metabolism via decreasing feed intake and independently decreasing de novo lipogenesis and palmitate esterification. ...|$|R
