50|$|The text {{states that}} from the {{darkness}} <b>emerged</b> ether (or space).

Between atmosphere and land <b>emerged</b> the divine person (Purusha) with one thousand heads, one thousand eyes, one thousand arms, and one thousand feet, who created death. The Brahman then created seven sons filled with truth, called Prajapatis. Out of the divine Purusha's mouth <b>emerged</b> the Brahmins, from the arms <b>emerged</b> the Kshatriyas, from the thighs <b>emerged</b> the Vaishyas and from the feet <b>emerged</b> the Shudras.

40|$|Academics and {{practitioners}} alike have long understood the benefits, {{if not the}} risks, of both <b>emerging</b> markets and <b>emerging</b> technologies. Yet it is only recently that foresighted firms have embraced <b>emerging</b> technologies and <b>emerging</b> markets through entrepreneurial activity. <b>Emerging</b> technologies and <b>emerging</b> markets present both unique challenges and tremendous opportunities for those firms and individuals who focus their search for competitive advantage on them. Here, we provide examples of effective commercial pathways for both intra- and entrepreneurial ventures embracing these phenomena. First, we describe how one intrapreneurial large firm is investigating <b>emerging</b> markets such as India and China (<b>emerging</b> economies) with <b>emerging</b> technologies to create a worldwide business solution power. Then the investigation of an <b>emerging</b> technology is provided, that of nanotechnology, by a small entrepreneurial firm utilizing <b>emerging</b> market skill sets to define and enable worldwide business solutions. Interestingly, both of the respective commercialization strategies are based on competency theory albeit, used differently. Finally, we discuss the ability of large and small firm competency-based strategies to wrest value from the opportunities inherent in <b>emerging</b> markets and technologies...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{differences}} observed on stock returns {{before and after}} the opening of <b>emerging</b> markets. The stock returns from <b>emerging</b> and non-emerging countries were examined with the aim to identify if there is a co-integration between markets during the period of December 1975 through April 2009. In our findings, we observed no significant differences during the period. We conclude, therefore, that even though the process of economic liberalisation had been important to the <b>emerging</b> countries, in the first instance, changes were not felt in the stock market as arising from the openings of the <b>emerging</b> economies. stock markets; <b>emerging</b> countries; co-integration; stock returns; <b>emerging</b> markets; economic liberalisation; <b>emerging</b> economies. ...|$|R

The degree of financial integration within the convergence clubs as well as the extent of reserve accumulation are found to be the most significant factors to explain divergent current account patterns in <b>emerging</b> Europe and <b>emerging</b> Asia...|$|R
