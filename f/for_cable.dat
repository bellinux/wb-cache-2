25|$|On 25 September 1883, {{a test of}} a {{cable car}} system was held by Liverpool United Tramways and Omnibus Company in Kirkdale, Liverpool. This {{would have been the}} first cable car system in Europe, but the company decided against {{implementing}} it. Instead, the distinction went to the 1884 route from Archway to Highgate, north London, which used a continuous cable and grip system on the 1 in 11 (9%) climb of Highgate Hill. The installation was not reliable and was replaced by electric traction in 1909. Other cable car systems were implemented in Europe, though, among which was the Glasgow District Subway, the first underground cable car system, in 1896. (London, England's first deep-level tube railway, the City & South London Railway, had earlier also been built <b>for</b> <b>cable</b> haulage but had been converted to electric traction before opening in 1890.) A few more cable car systems were built in the United Kingdom, Portugal, and France. European cities, having many more curves in their streets, were ultimately less suitable <b>for</b> <b>cable</b> cars than American cities.|$|E
