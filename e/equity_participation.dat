25|$|Business {{regulations}} have been overhauled along liberal lines, especially since 1999. Most {{barriers to the}} flow of capital and international direct investment have been removed. Foreign investors do not face any restrictions on the inflow of capital, and investment of up to 100% of <b>equity</b> <b>participation</b> is allowed in most sectors. Unlimited remittance of profits, dividends, service fees or capital is now the rule. However, doing business has been becoming increasingly difficult {{over the past decade}} due to political instability, rising domestic insurgency and insecurity and vehement corruption. This can be confirmed by the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index report degrading its ratings for Pakistan each year since September 2009 when it ranked Pakistan (at 85th) well ahead of neighbours like China (at 89th) and India (at 133rd).|$|E

25|$|Until the {{liberalisation}} of 1991, India {{was largely}} and intentionally isolated from world markets, {{to protect its}} economy and to achieve self-reliance. Foreign trade was subject to import tariffs, export taxes and quantitative restrictions, while foreign direct investment (FDI) was restricted by upper-limit <b>equity</b> <b>participation,</b> restrictions on technology transfer, export obligations and government approvals; these approvals were needed for nearly 60% of new FDI in the industrial sector. The restrictions ensured that FDI averaged only around $200million annually between 1985 and 1991; {{a large percentage of}} the capital flows consisted of foreign aid, commercial borrowing and deposits of non-resident Indians. India's exports were stagnant for the first 15years after independence, due to general neglect of trade policy by the government of that period; imports in the same period, with early industrialisation, consisted predominantly of machinery, raw materials and consumer goods.|$|E
25|$|On June 17, 2009, {{the city}} council and WCSA came to an {{agreement}} on a new financing plan crafted by city CFO Natwar Gandhi. Under the plan, the city would loan Marriott $80 million in return for Marriott, Capstone, and Quadrangle raising their equity contribution to $320 million from $135 million. To obtain the additional equity money, ING Clarion Real Estate Investment was added as a new partner in the project. The higher <b>equity</b> <b>participation</b> meant that Marriott would {{no longer need to}} seek private lending as part of the agreement—which meant construction could go forward without the long delay that would occur while seeking bank loans. The city's total contribution would be $267 million ($135 million in equity financing, $80 million in loans, and $52 million in WCSA bond refinancing), all to be raised by a joint city-WCSA bond issue.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} the first to {{investigate}} the importance of geography in explaining <b>equity</b> market <b>participation.</b> We provide evidence to support two distinct local area effects. The first is a community ownership effect, that is, individuals are influenced by the investment behavior of members of their community.

The second is that proximity to publicly-traded firms also increases <b>equity</b> market <b>participation.</b> In particular, the presence of publicly-traded firms within 50 miles and the share of U.

[...] By December 2013, Chinese investors were rumoured to be potential investors. [...] In February 2014, the Peugeot family agreed to give up control of the company by reducing its holdings from 25% to 14%. As part of this agreement, Dongfeng Motors and the French government were each to buy 14% stakes in the company, creating three partners with equal voting rights. The board of directors was to be composed of six independent members, two representatives of each Dongfeng, the French state and the Peugeot family, and two members representing employees and employees shareholders. [...] The French government took the view the deal did not require approval by Brussels as EU competition rules do not count public investment in a company on the same terms as a private investor as state aid. The <b>equity</b> <b>participation</b> by Dongfeng expanded an already budding relationship with Peugeot.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{empirical}} predictions arising from settings of ambiguity aversion in intertemporal heterogenous agents economies. We study equilibria for two tractable wealth-homothetic settings of ambiguity aversion in continuous time. Such settings {{are motivated by}} a different robust control optimization problem. We show that ambiguity aversion affects optimal portfolio exposures {{in a way that}} is similar to an increase in risk aversion. A distinct property of the second of our settings of ambiguity aversion is that such increase is state-dependent and highly pronounced at moderate portfolio exposures. This feature causes quite prudent levels of <b>equity</b> market <b>participation</b> over a nontrivial set of states of the economy. In general equilibrium, ambiguity aversion tends to induce a higher equilibrium equity premium and lower interest rates. A distinct feature of the second of our settings of ambiguity aversion is that the equity premium part due to ambiguity aversion dominates when the exogenous random factors in the economy have low volatility. Thus, such setting can account for some distinct empirical predictions - like a limited <b>equity</b> market <b>participation</b> and ambiguity <b>equity</b> premia that dominate equity premia for small equity volatilities - which are unavailable under the first of our settings of ambiguity aversion...|$|R
