The boundary layers at the inlet to the bend were approximately 25 percent and 15 percent of the hydraulic diameter for the laminar and turbulent flows, respectively. The development of the pressure driven secondary motion is more rapid for laminar flow: the maximum cross stream component measured was 60 percent of the bulk velocity in contrast to 40 percent for turbulent flow. The streamwise <b>isotachs</b> show that, for laminar flow, large velocities are found progressively nearer to the outer radius of the bend and along the sidewalls.

40|$|Abstract-We {{introduce}} {{a class of}} networks called <b>isotach</b> networks designed {{to reduce the cost}} of synchronization in parallel computations. <b>Isotach</b> networks maintain an invariant that allows each process to control the logical times at which its messages are received and consequently executed. This control allows processes to pipeline operations without sacrificing sequential consistency and to send isochrons, groups of operations that appear to be received and executed as an indivisible unit. Isochrons allow processes to execute atomic actions without locks. Other uses of <b>isotach</b> networks include ensuring causal message delivery and consistency among replicated data. <b>Isotach</b> networks are characterized by this invariant, not by their topology. They can be imple-mented {{in a wide variety of}} configurations, including NUMA (nonuniform memory access) multiprocessors. Empirical and analytic studies of <b>isotach</b> synchronization techniques show that they outperform conventional techniques, in some cases by an order of magnitude or more.

40|$|An {{investigation}} is made into the three-dimensional structure {{of wind and}} temperature in Jovian vortices. Through the thermal wind equation, vertical wind gradients are related to horizontal temperature gradients. We derive the thermal wind equation including the cyclostrophic term. We posit a similarity model for the horizontal-vertical structure of potential temperature in a vortex. In this model, the thermal wind equation may be solved for the case of concentric, homeccentric, elliptical streamlines coincident with <b>isotachs.</b> The solution is seen to give a separable horizontal-vertical structure in the geostrophic and cyclostrophic limits, but not in between. The case where eccentricity is neither zero nor unity is seen to be problematic, however, because the flow then implies non-vanishing divergence. This formal solution is applied to two vortices on Jupiter – the Great Red Spot and the White Oval BC. Radial-vertical sections of <b>isotachs,</b> angular momentum, potential temperature, and potential vorticity in these vortices are presented and discussed.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{a new class}} of directory coherence protocols called delta coherence protocols that use network guarantees to support a new and highly concurrent approach to maintain a consistent shared memory. Delta coherence protocols are more concurrent than other coherence protocols in that they allow processes to pipeline memory accesses without violating sequential consistency; support multiple concurrent readers and writers to the same cache block; and allow processes to access multiple shared variables atomically without invalidating the copies held by other processes or otherwise obtaining exclusive access to the referenced variables. Delta protocols include both update and invalidate protocols. In this paper we describe the simplest, most basic delta protocol, an update protocol called the home update protocol. Delta protocols are based on <b>isotach</b> network guarantees. An <b>isotach</b> network maintains a logical time system that allows each process to predict and control the logical time at which its messages are received.
