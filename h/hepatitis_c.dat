5|$|The {{infectious}} disease <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> {{is caused by}} the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The infection is often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis). This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Certain {{parasitic}} liver diseases may be {{risk factors}} as well. Colonization with the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini (found in Thailand, Laos PDR, and Vietnam) or Clonorchis sinensis (found in China, Taiwan, eastern Russia, Korea, and Vietnam) {{has been associated}} with the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Patients with chronic liver disease, whether in the form of viral hepatitis (e.g. hepatitis B or <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C),</b> alcoholic liver disease, or cirrhosis of the liver due to other causes, are at significantly increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. HIV infection was also identified in one study as a potential risk factor for cholangiocarcinoma, although it was unclear whether HIV itself or other correlated and confounding factors (e.g. <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> infection) were responsible for the association.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> is an {{infectious}} disease {{caused by the}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or dilated {{blood vessels in the}} esophagus and stomach.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{prevalence}} of <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> {{in patients with}} glioblastoma multiforme or meningiomas has not been described. These infections are known to modulate {{the activity of the}} immune system, which potentially influences the development and course of cancer. We hypothesized that chronic hepatitis infection, which activates the immune system, decreases the risk of brain tumors, particularly those that are highly malignant. We performed a retrospective study to examine the {{prevalence of}} <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> in patients with meningiomas and glioblastomas. The combined prevalence of <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> in the USA from 1999 - 2008 was 5. 7 %. The prevalence of <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> in patients with meningiomas was 2. 4 %; while among glioblastoma patients, the prevalence of <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> was 1. 38 %. The odds ratio of having <b>hepatitis</b> B or <b>C</b> with glioblastoma versus meningiomas was 0. 56, with a confidence interval of 0. 19 - 1. 6 and a P-value of 0. 29. Compared with historical controls, the prevalence of <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> in meningioma and glioblastoma patients was decreased. However, this difference may be attributed to the retrospective nature of our data and the natural history of <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> infections. The prevalence of these viral infections was not statistically different in patients with meningiomas and glioblastomas. This suggests that <b>hepatitis</b> B and <b>C</b> primarily influence slow-growing, benign tumors and more aggressive cancers equally, if at all. To definitively test our hypothesis, future studies in which data are prospectively gathered are likely to be required...|$|R

5|$|One such {{success is}} related to {{identifying}} the genetic variant associated with response to anti-hepatitis C virus treatment. For genotype 1 <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> treated with Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b combined with ribavirin, a GWA study has shown that SNPs near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences {{in response to the}} treatment. A later report demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> virus. These major findings facilitated the development of personalized medicine and allowed physicians to customize medical decisions based on the patient's genotype.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> {{is caused}} by an RNA virus. In 80% of people {{infected}}, the disease is chronic, and without treatment, they are infected {{for the remainder of}} their lives.

The treatment of chronic carriers of the hepatitis B virus by using a similar strategy using lamivudine has been developed.|$|E
40|$|The {{type and}} {{concentration}} of sera {{used to support}} macrophages was found to influence the in vitro destruction of macrophages from genetically resistant C 3 H mice by the VRINCETON strain of mouse hepatitis virus, and the accompany-ing conversion of mouse hepatitis virus (PRINCETON) to the variant virus, mouse <b>hepatitis</b> virus (<b>C</b> 3 H). Cells incubated in 2 o ~ horse serum were more susceptible to destruction than those in 9 o ~ horse serum. Susceptibility was greatest {{in the presence of}} IO ~ foetal calf serum, while cells in IO ~ mouse sera were the most resistant. Differences in susceptibility were as great as io,ooo TCD 5 o. The sera had no direct effect upon either mouse hepatitis virus (PRINCETON) inoculum virus or the released variant virus, but appeared to influence intracellular adapta-tion of virus. In plaque titrations using reduced concentration of horse sera, mouse heptatitis virus (VRINCETON) produced small plaques on C 3 H cells. The variant virus, mouse <b>hepatitis</b> virus (<b>C</b> 3 H), produced both large plaques character-istic of mouse <b>hepatitis</b> virus (<b>C</b> 3 H) and small plaques characteristic ofmouse hepa-titis virus (PRINCETON). The results suggest hat a fraction of mouse hepatitis virus (VRINCETON) virus multiplies in resistant C 3 H cells, and is then converted to mouse <b>hepatitis</b> virus (<b>C</b> 3 H), and that mouse hepatitis virus (PRINCETON) continues to be carried in stocks of mouse <b>hepatitis</b> virus (<b>C</b> 3 H) during passage in C 3 H cells. The outcome of infection of genetically resistant C 3 H macrophages with mouse hepatitis virus (PRINCETON) was greatly influenced by the type and concentration of sera used to support macrophages...|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, direct transmission is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
5|$|Infection, {{bacterial}} or viral, {{particularly from}} Staphylococcus aureus, group A streptococcus and Pseudomonas spp. Reports at the 16th European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases in 2006 indicated that bacterial infections are seldom serious, but that ten to {{twenty percent of}} piercings result in local benign bacterial infection. The Mayo Clinic estimates 30%. Risk of infection is greatest among those with congenital heart disease, who have a much higher chance of developing life-threatening infective endocarditis, hemophiliacs and diabetics, {{as well as those}} taking corticosteroids. In 2006, a diabetic woman in Indiana lost a breast due to an infection from a nipple piercing. Viral infections may include hepatitis B, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>C</b> and, potentially, HIV, although as of 2009 there had been no documented cases of HIV caused by piercing. While rare, infection due to piercing of the tongue can be fatal. Higher prevalence of colonization of Candida albicans was reported in young individuals with tongue piercing, in comparison to non-tongue-pierced matched individuals.|$|E

40|$|Background A high {{incidence}} rate of <b>hepatitis</b> B or <b>C</b> virus infection is found among thalassemia children in Indonesia. This may influence deferiprone effectiveness. Objective To determine {{the effectiveness of}} deferiprone in thalassemia children with or without <b>hepatitis</b> B or <b>C</b> virus infection. Methods A non-randomized clinical study was performed at Thalassemia Center Jakarta. Subjects were thalassemia children with serum ferritin level > 1000 ng/mL who had <b>hepatitis</b> B or <b>C</b> virus infection. A match control pair was recruited based on similar duration of transfusion therapy, thalassemia type, and initial serum ferritin level. All subjects received initial deferiprone dose of 50 mg/kg/day for 3 months. Those whose ferritin decreased 2 :: 10 % continued to receive deferiprone of 50 mg/kg/day for the following 3 months. Otherwise, deferiprone dose was adjusted to 75 mg/kg/day. Results Forty-eight subjects were recruited. After 3 months of treatment, 16 / 24 subjects without and 6 / 24 subjects with <b>hepatitis</b> B or <b>C</b> had their ferritin level decreased 2 :: 10 %. Mean ferritin serum level of all subjects after 6 months was significantly reduced from 4734 (SD 2116) to 3695 (SD 1709) ng/mL.
