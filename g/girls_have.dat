The <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> character, and that's saying {{a good deal about}} a woman, especially a <b>girl.</b> She <b>has</b> departed widely from the conventional type without losing essential womanliness." ...|$|R

The girls were rescued from a cavern beneath the sanatorium by detective Chōshirō Kirishima, who had been pursuing Haibara, but they had all lost their memories. Two years later, a catastrophe strikes Rougetsu Island which kills off the inhabitants. Eight years later, in the present, two of the rescued <b>girls</b> <b>have</b> died in mysterious circumstances and two of the survivors, Misaki Asō and Madoka Tsukimori, return to discover the truth about their pasts.

Chōshirō, the detective who rescued them, also returns to the island to both find Ruka and continue his pursuit of Haibara.

They {{have been}} known to seek the society of girls in general, of any girl, because some <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> made them happy; and when some <b>girl</b> <b>has</b> made them unhappy, they are still more susceptible.
