5|$|For a given tonnage, {{the second}} factor which governs the ship's {{dimensions}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the ports and waterways it will travel to. For example, a vessel that will pass the Panama Canal will be limited in its beam and draft. For most designs, the ratio of length-to-width ranges between 5 and 7, {{with an average of}} 6.2. The ratio of length-to-height will be between 11 and 12.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} Parthian army is unknown, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of the empire's overall population. However, archaeological {{excavations}} {{in former}} Parthian urban centers reveal settlements which could have sustained large populations and hence a great resource in manpower. Dense population centers in regions like Babylonia were no doubt attractive to the Romans, whose armies could afford to live off the land.|$|E
5|$|This list {{of birds}} of Ontario {{includes}} all the bird species {{recorded in the}} Canadian province of Ontario {{as determined by the}} Ontario Bird Records Committee (OBRC). There are, as of April 2017, 495 species on this list, 291 of which are known to breed in the province. Ontario has a considerable variety of bird species. One of the factors in this diversity <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> and range of environments in Ontario. Another is the Great Lakes; many birds use the shores as a stopping point during migration.|$|E

5|$|Kepler-4b's {{discovery}} was announced on January 4, 2010. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of planet Neptune, at 0.077 MJ (7% {{the mass of}} Jupiter) and 0.357 RJ (36% the radius of Jupiter). The planet orbits its star every 3.214 days at 0.045 AU from the star. This distance compares to planet Mercury, which is 0.39 AU from the Sun. Kepler-4's eccentricity {{was assumed to be}} 0, however a subsequent independent reanalysis of the discovery data found a value of 0.25 ± 0.12. Likewise, the temperature of the planet is assumed to be 1650 K, far hotter than Jupiter's, which is assumed to be 124 K (not considering its internal heat and atmosphere).|$|E
5|$|Mating {{occurs during}} the winter months. Once a female quoll has been impregnated, the folds on her abdomen convert into a pouch that opens at the back. The {{gestation}} period is 21 days. A baby quoll, or pup, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> of a grain of rice. Up to 18 quolls are born in each litter, but only six survive the first two weeks. The survivors stay in their mother's pouch for eight weeks, suckling {{on one of the}} mother's six teats for milk. During the ninth week, the pups venture out of the pouch and onto the mother's back, where they remain for six weeks. Quolls reaches maturity when they are one year old, and have a natural lifespan of between two and five years. A 2008 study of the pouches of tiger quolls reported the pouches' appearance' were reliable indicators of the quolls' reproductive status: during the follicular phase, pouches were found to be red and have many secretions. After ovulation, pouches became deep and wet. Researchers can use this information to determine where a female quoll is in her ovarian cycle, which is anticipated to be helpful in breeding management.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} (Neovison macrodon) is a {{recently}} extinct species of mink {{from the eastern}} coast of North America in the family Mustelidae, the largest family in the order Carnivora. It was most {{closely related to the}} American mink (Neovison vison), with debate {{about whether or not the}} sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (making it Neovison vison macrodon) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>size</b> difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.|$|E
