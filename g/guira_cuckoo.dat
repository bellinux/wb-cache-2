60|$|Between {{the border}} poplar walk and the foss outside, there grew a single {{row of trees}} of a very {{different}} kind--the black acacia, a rare and singular tree, and of all our trees this one made the strongest and sharpest impression on my mind as well as flesh, pricking its image in me, so to speak. It had probably been planted originally by the early first planter, and, I imagine, experimentally, as a possible improvement on the wide-spreading disorderly aloe, a favourite with the first settlers; {{but it is a}} wild lawless plant and had refused to make a proper hedge. Some of these acacias had remained small and were like old scraggy bushes, some were dwarfish trees, while others had sprung up like the fabled bean-stalk and were as tall as the poplars that grew side by side with them. These tall specimens had slender boles and threw out their slender horizontal branches of great length on all sides, from the roots to the crown, the branches and the bole itself being armed with thorns two to four inches long, hard as iron, black or chocolate-brown, polished and sharp as needles; and to make itself more formidable every long thorn had two smaller thorns growing out of it near the base, so that it was in shape like a round tapering dagger with a crossguard to the handle. It was a terrible tree to climb, yet, when a little older. I had to climb it a thousand times, since there were certain birds which would make their nests in it, often as high up as they could, and some of these were birds that laid beautiful eggs, such as those of the <b>Guira</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> the size of pullets' eggs, of the purest turquoise blue flecked with snowy white.|$|E
50|$|Four species {{make up the}} subfamily, {{namely the}} <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Guira guira) and the {{three members of the}} genus Crotophaga known as anis. Study of the cranial {{osteology}} and mitochondrial DNA yield the same phylogeny, namely that the Smooth-billed and groove-billed ani are each other's closest relatives, with the greater ani related and the <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> an earlier offshoot of the group.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} {{is notable}} {{for the development}} of cooperative breeding where several females lay eggs in a communal nest. It contains the three anis and the <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The zoo's [...] "Barnyard" [...] is an {{educational}} exhibit that teaches about where food comes from {{and interact with}} domesticated animals including: goats, sheep, chickens, red jungle-fowl, rabbits, llamas, alpaca, donkeys, and a cat. Non-interactive exhibits include mice, skunk, opossum, a beehive and spiders. Birds in the walk-in free-flight aviary include scarlet ibis, Spotted Whistling ducks, band-tailed pigeons, green heron, <b>Guira</b> <b>cuckoos,</b> Nicobar pigeons, African grey parrots, California quails, and Golden pheasants.|$|R
60|$|The {{season was}} also {{favourable}} for mice; that is, of course, favourable {{for the time}} being, unfavourable in the long run, since the short-lived, undue preponderance of a species is invariably followed by {{a long period of}} undue depression. These prolific little creatures were soon so abundant that the dogs subsisted almost exclusively on them; the fowls also, from incessantly pursuing and killing them, became quite rapacious in their manner; whilst the sulphur tyrant-birds (Pitangus) and the <b>Guira</b> <b>cuckoos</b> preyed on nothing but mice.|$|R
30|$|Cuckoos are {{birds with}} an {{aggressive}} breeding strategy. Some {{species such as}} Ani and <b>Guira</b> <b>cuckoos</b> place their eggs in communal nests, and sometimes remove other species’ eggs to increase the hatching probability of their own eggs. Other species lay their eggs in nesting host birds (often of other species). New World brood-parasitic Tapera species have evolved {{in such a way}} that the female parasitic cuckoos are often very specialized in the mimicry of the color and pattern of the eggs of a few chosen host species. This ability reduces the probability of their eggs being abandoned and thus increasing their reproductivity [26].|$|R
50|$|Birds {{at the zoo}} include African red-billed hornbill, bald eagle, black-throated magpie-jay, blue-bellied roller, green-winged macaw, <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> king vulture, kookaburra, Palawan peacock-pheasant, Panama yellow-crowned amazon, silvery-cheeked hornbill, spotted thick-knee, tawny frogmouth, wreathed hornbill, violaceous turaco.|$|E
50|$|The <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is arboreal, but can {{frequently}} {{be seen on}} the ground, {{usually in}} flocks of 6 to 18 individuals. It is sometimes seen with other birds such as the smooth-billed ani (Crotophaga ani) whose behaviour is similar.|$|E
50|$|The <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Guira guira) is a social, non-parasitic cuckoo found {{widely in}} open and semi-open {{habitats}} of {{eastern and southern}} Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Bolivia, and north-eastern Argentina. It is monotypic within the genus Guira, and {{is related to the}} anis.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{aggressive}} and will defend rich food sources from other nectarivores; {{due to its}} size, it is generally dominant over other species of hummingbirds. Even much larger birds are attacked by diving at them when they perch; particularly when breeding the swallow-tailed hummingbird will go and [...] "dive-bomb" [...] birds twice its own length or more, such as Campo flickers (Colaptes campestris), curl-crested jays (Cyanocorax cristatellus) or smooth-billed anis (Crotophaga ani), until they have enough and leave. Disturbed by much larger birds such as <b>Guira</b> <b>cuckoos</b> (<b>Guira</b> guira) or hawks, it will usually just give warning calls, but a female swallow-tailed hummingbird has been observed to attack a Swainson's hawk (Buteo swainsonii) [...] weighing {{more than a hundred}} times as much as the hummingbird [...] in mid-air. Warning calls are also given at mammalian carnivores and humans, though in urban environment this hummingbird may tolerate human observers for prolonged time, even when nesting, if they keep a distance of 10 meters or so.|$|R
500|$|The {{species is}} territorial, with the males {{defending}} the territory. Nesting timing varies by location; in Venezuela {{it is reported}} to occur {{during the rainy season}} (June to September), and in Argentina during the austral summer (October to January). The nests are cup-shaped, [...] across, [...] high and [...] deep. Nests have been recorded being constructed from fine dry grass, or woven plant fibre and a few rootlets. Nests are placed in the forks of branches [...] up in trees [...] tall. The clutch size is three eggs, which are greenish with brown spots. Both sexes incubate the eggs during the 14–15 day brooding period. The species has been described as very tame during this interval – staying on the nest even as researchers came within a few centimetres of the bird – but were very aggressive in attacking birds, like <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoos,</b> or other animals that came near the nest. The hatchlings are dark-skinned with grey down and pink mouths. Pink mouths in chicks are very unusual in suboscines.|$|R

50|$|The <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is a bird of open {{habitats}} and therefore {{has expanded its}} range on human-altered wooded areas, being found even in suburban parks and gardens. It feeds on large arthropods, frogs, eggs, small birds (especially nestlings) and small mammals such as mice. As {{it is not an}} accomplished flier, mostly gliding or hopping from one perch to another - clumsier, but otherwise similar to the related squirrel cuckoo - it acts as an opportunistic predator, gathering small prey items on the ground or searching for them among branches. The <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> is often seen in small groups in open habitats, gliding from one treetop to another foraging, while vocalizating loudly. The bird's call is unmistakable for being long and shrill, something between a long whistle and a wailing.|$|E
50|$|The {{species has}} whitish-buff underparts and rump, dark {{brownish}} upperparts, a broadly white-tipped dark tail that is relatively long, an orange-rufous crest, bare yellow ocular-skin (commonly fades in captivity), and a relatively heavy, orange-yellow bill. It is generally rather shaggy-looking {{and has a}} total length of approximately 34 cm. Like {{other members of the}} subfamily Crotophaginae, the <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> gives off a strong, pungent odour.|$|E
50|$|Due to the climatic {{regime of}} the Gran Chaco, herpetofauna are {{restricted}} to moist refugia in various places throughout the chaco. Rotting logs, debris piles, old housing settlement, wells, and seasonal farm ponds are examples of such refugia. The black-legged seriema (Chunga burmeisteri), blue-crowned parakeet (Aratinga acuticadauta), Picui ground dove (Columbina picui), <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Guira guira), little thornbird (Phacellodomus sibilatrix) and many-colored Chaco finch (Saltaitricula multicolor) are notable of the 409 bird species that are resident or breed in the Gran Chaco. 252 of these Chaco species are endemic to South America.|$|E
6000|$|They often select {{an exposed}} weed to feed on, {{clustering}} together on its summit above the surrounding verdure, an exceedingly conspicuous object to every {{eye in the}} neighbourhood. They also frequently change their feeding-ground; at such times they deliberately cross wide roads and other open spaces, barren of grass, where, moving so slowly that they scarcely seem to move at all, they look at a distance {{like a piece of}} black velvet lying on the ground. Thus in every imaginable way they expose themselves and invite attack; yet, in spite of it all, I have never detected birds preying on them, and I have sometimes kept one of these black societies under observation near my house for several days, watching them at intervals, in places where the trees overhead were the resort of Icterine and tyrant birds, <b>Guira</b> <b>cuckoos,</b> and other species, all great hunters after grasshoppers. A young grasshopper is, moreover, a morsel that seldom comes amiss to any bird, whether insect or seed eater; and, as a rule, it is extremely shy, nimble, and inconspicuous. It seems clear that, although the young Zoniopoda does not mimic in its form any black protected insect, it nevertheless owes its safety to its blackness, together with the habit it possesses of exposing itself in so open and bold a manner. Blackness is so common in large protected insects, as, for instance, in the un-palatable leaf-cutting ants, scorpions, mygale spiders, wasps, and other dangerous kinds, that it is manifestly a [...] "warning colour," [...] the most universal and best known in nature; and the grasshopper, I believe, furthermore mimics the fearless demeanour of the protected or venomous species, which birds and other insect-eaters know and respect. It might be supposed that the young Zoniopoda is itself unpalatable; but this is scarcely probable, for when the deceptive black mask is once dropped, the excessive shyness, love of concealment, and protective colouring of the insect show that it is much sought after by birds.|$|R
50|$|This lizard lives {{mainly in}} open habitat types, {{especially}} restinga, {{part of the}} Atlantic Forest biome. It may occupy disturbed and degraded restinga. It is also known from the Abrolhos Archipelago, indicating that it can colonize offshore islands. It lives in the Cerrado. It {{may be found in}} residential areas, where it is adept at climbing the walls of houses. It is mostly ground-dwelling, living in termite nests and on or under rocks and logs. It is associated with many other animals, including giant ameiva, coati, brown capuchin, <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo,</b> and false coral snake.|$|E
5000|$|The cuckoos are an {{extremely}} {{diverse group of}} birds with regards to breeding systems. The majority of species are monogamous, but there are exceptions. The anis and the <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> lay their eggs in communal nests, which is built by {{all members of the}} group. Incubation, brooding and territorial defence duties are shared by all members of the group. Within these species the anis breed as groups of monogamous pairs, but the guira cuckoos are not monogamous within the group, exhibiting a polygynandrous breeding system. This group nesting behaviour is not completely cooperative; females compete and may remove others' eggs when laying hers. Eggs are usually only ejected early in the breeding season in the anis, but can be ejected at any time by guria cuckoos. Polyandry has been confirmed in the African black coucal and is suspected to occur in the other coucals, perhaps explaining the reversed sexual dimorphism in the group.|$|E
50|$|The {{subfamily}} Cuculinae are the brood-parasitic cuckoos of the Old World. They tend {{to conform}} to the classic shape, with (usually) long tails, short legs, long narrow wings and an arboreal lifestyle. The largest species, the channel-billed cuckoo, also has the most outsized bill in the family, resembling that of a hornbill. The subfamily Phaenicophaeinae are the non-parasitic cuckoos of the Old World, and include the couas, malkohas, and ground-cuckoos. They are more terrestrial cuckoos, with strong and often long legs and short rounded wings. The subfamily typically has brighter plumage and brightly coloured bare skin around the eye. The coucals are another terrestrial Old World subfamily of long tailed long legged and short winged cuckoos. They are large heavyset birds with the largest, the greater black coucal, being around {{the same size as the}} channel-billed cuckoo. The subfamily Coccyzinae are arboreal and long tailed as well, with a number of large insular forms. The New World ground cuckoos are similar to the Asian ground-cuckoos in being long legged and terrestrial, and includes the long billed roadrunner, which can reach speeds of 30 km/h when chasing prey. The final subfamily are the atypical anis, which include the small clumsy anis and the larger <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo.</b> The anis have massive bills and smooth glossy feathers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract This report {{presents}} {{a description of}} natural infection of an adult free-living <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> with Paratanaisia confusa. Histological and morphological evaluations of renal and parasite samples were performed. The morphological analysis of the parasites revealed spiny tegument, characteristic of P. confusa helminthes. Although macroscopic alterations were absent in the kidneys, the histopathology revealed parasites inside the collecting ducts causing dilatation and destruction of the lining epithelial cells in addition to small focal inflammatory infiltrates in the renal parenchyma. However, as the bird was free-living and naturally infected {{it was not possible}} to confirm if all these alterations were directly caused by the parasite presence or if they were related to causes other than the parasitism. Nonetheless, such findings indicate that these trematodes may have pathogenic potential in this host...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. I {{examined}} {{reproductive behavior}} and the parental roles of group members in the communal <b>Guira</b> <b>Cuckoo</b> (Guira guira) in central Brazil. Feeding of chicks was observed at seven focal nests and censuses were con-ducted on active nests in 886 breeding attempts. Adults in five focal groups did not share equally in the feeding of chicks or in nest attendance. Chicks in smaller broods tended to receive more nearly equal amounts of food, whereas a few chicks in large broods received disproportionately large shares. Most food was offered to chicks in a random manner, but some adults (6 of 33) fed particular chicks more frequently than expected by chance. Nest-lings had a high mortality rate {{during the first week}} after hatching. Circumstantial evidence suggests that infan-ticide may be one important source of mortality in this population. Infanticide is hypothesized to function adap-tively as a means by which nonbreeding group members sabotage a breeding cycle. Such truncation may result in a shorter interval between attempts, thus providing nonbreeders with a new reproductive opportunity. Accepte...|$|E
40|$|The hoatzin (Opisthocomus hoazin) {{lives in}} the humid {{lowlands}} of northern and central South America, often in riparian habitats. It is a slender bird approximately 65 cm in length, brownish with lighter streaks and buffy tips to the long tail feathers. The small head has a ragged, bristly crest of reddish-brown feathers, and the bare skin of the face is bright blue. It resembles a chachalaca (Ortalis, Cracidae) in size and shape, but its plumage and markings {{are similar to those}} of the smaller <b>guira</b> <b>cuckoo</b> (Guira guira). The hoatzin (pronounced Watson) has been a taxonomic puzzle since it was described in 1776. It usually has been viewed as related to the gallinaceous birds, but alliances to other groups have been suggested, including the cuckoos. We present DNA sequence evidence from the 12 S and 16 S rRNA mitochondrial genes, and from the nuclear gene that codes for the eye lens protein, alpha A-crystallin. The results indicate that the hoatzin is most closely related to the typical cuckoos and that the divergence occurred at or near the base of the cuculiform phylogenetic tree...|$|E
