40|$|We {{argue that}} in a {{nonlinear}} gravity theory, which according to well-known results is dynamically equivalent to a self-gravitating scalar field in General Relativity, the true physical variables are exactly those which describe the equivalent general-relativistic model (these variables are known as Einstein frame). Whenever such variables cannot be defined, there are strong indications that the original theory is unphysical. We explicitly show how to map, {{in the presence of}} matter, the Jordan frame to the Einstein one and backwards. We study energetics for asymptotically flat solutions. This is based on the second-order dynamics obtained, without changing the metric, by the use of a Helmholtz Lagrangian.

40|$|The {{extended}} superspace generalized local gauge transformations are studied {{under a new}} light. We {{have previously}} proved that the local internal gauge symmetry groups of the Standard Model are isomorphic to local tensor products of the local one-dimensional group LB 1. Independently to LB 2 as well. LB 1 is SO(1; 1) plus two di erent kinds of discrete transformations, one of them non-Lorentzian. LB 2 is SO(2). All of this in curved four-dimensional Lorentzian spacetimes. LB 1 was proved to be isomorphic to LB 2. That is, a non-compact group plus two discrete transformations, isomorphic to a compact group. Special tetrads were de fined such that they are locally gauge dependent. In {{such a way that}} when a local gauge transformation is carried out, these tetrads transform on one hand in a local plane one determined by the timelike and one spacelike tetrad vectors under LB 1. Independently, on the other hand, these tetrads transform on the local plane two determined by the other two spacelike tetrad vectors, under LB 2. The local planes one and two are orthogonal. The local tetrad vectors do not leave their original local planes under local gauge transformations and this is crucial for the metric tensor to remain invariant. On a local plane one or two spanned by just two of our tetrad vectors with a single and unique structure like a unique extremal fi eld-gauge vector structure, the tensor product of one-dimensional groups like LB 1 on the local plane one or LB 2 on local plane two, would just be one-dimensional. However {{this is not the case}} we are discussing in this manuscript and we will clarify this situation during the analysis. In this note we will implement the construction of new tetrads and find additional isomorphisms between superspace generalized local supergauge non-Abelian transformations and spacetime local tetrad transformations, following a similar line of reasoning even though the spacetime will be considered <b>flat</b> in our <b>proofs.</b> The applicability of such a notion would be raised immediately. We therefore conjecture about the possibility of superspace to become relevant during the annihilation dynamical evolution. Because a certain number of variables are necessary in order to build the tetrads that might undergo a local transformation from non-null into null. We conjecture the possibility that during an annihilation process of two leptons, an electron and a positron for instance, the pure four-dimensional spacetime in which these leptons exist is extended both in coordinates and fi elds such that superspace becomes relevant. We will follow a similar course to previous work in this paper, in order to prove analogous theorems between local groups of superspace non-Abelian supergauge transformations and local groups of tetrad transformations...|$|R
