50|$|In {{the famous}} Hitman game series, the <b>Fugu</b> <b>poison</b> is a {{signature}} weapon of Agent 47.|$|E
50|$|Fugu {{contains}} lethal {{amounts of}} the poison tetrodotoxin in its inner organs, especially the liver, the ovaries, eyes, and skin. The poison, a sodium channel blocker, paralyzes the muscles while the victim stays fully conscious (thus making the effects somewhat {{similar to those of}} the nerve agents Sarin and VX); the poisoned victim is unable to breathe, and eventually dies from asphyxiation. There is no known antidote for <b>fugu</b> <b>poison</b> The standard treatment is to support the respiratory and circulatory systems until the poison is metabolized and excreted by the victim's body.|$|E

Of the 23 incidents recorded within Tokyo between 1993 and 2006, only one {{took place in a}} restaurant, while the others all involved fishermen eating their catch.

Between 34 and 64 victims were hospitalized, and zero to six died, per year, {{with an average}} fatality rate of 6.8%.

Poisonings through amateur preparation can result from confusion between types of puffer, as well as improper methods, and some may represent deliberate suicide attempts. Engelbert Kaempfer, a German physician who resided in Japan in the 1690s, reported that an unusually toxic variety of puffer was sometimes sought out by individuals who wished to take their own lives.|$|R
