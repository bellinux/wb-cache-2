40|$|Customers are passionately loyal {{about doing}} {{business}} with sellers who can always be trusted to act {{in their best interest}} over time. This research tries to identify how to develop a total trust relationship. The core antecedents behind this total-trust relationship are reciprocal responsiveness, shared understanding, personal disclosure, customization and cooperative concern. We examine how these antecedents affect satisfaction and trust en route to affecting loyalty. Based on data <b>from</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>services,</b> we empirically test and substantiate the roles of these antecedents in building loyalty. A total-trust framework incorporating services effectiveness and functional efficiency is proposed. Managerial implications and directions for future research are also given.

30|$|Third, {{the problem}} of basic risk faced by farmers also {{influences}} the demand for insurance services. Farmers might experience losses that are not correlated with the insured index. Therefore, despite the real advantages that might be gained in participating in crop insurance, some essential conditions must be met within a country in order for farmers to truly benefit <b>from</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>services.</b> For example, the presence of good and well-functional physical and institutional infrastructures must be present in a country to allow farmers to make their claims and private insurance companies verify their losses. These may include good roads, well-functioning regulatory structures, rules of law, and product delivery mechanisms, among others. Lastly, other minor challenges include wealth and liquidity constraints and religious and cultural beliefs, among others. As reported in Janzen et al. (2013) and Dercon and Christiaensen (2011), poor farmers remain {{less likely to have}} the wealth and liquidity that is needed to purchase insurance policies. Jensen and Barrett (2016) highlight the barriers associated with religious and cultural beliefs. For instance, in northern Kenya, insurance schemes that did not comply with Sharia law (Islamic religious law) were not initially well accepted in the region (Jensen and Barrett 2016). Finally, there is also a risk of increased premium payments and also insurers withdrawing support in the face of increasing likelihood of crop failure (Tucker 1997; Mills 2007; Duncan and Myers 2000).|$|E

50|$|Although {{surplus line}} {{insurers}} are still {{regulated by the}} states (or countries) {{in which they are}} actually admitted, the disadvantages of obtaining <b>insurance</b> <b>from</b> a surplus line insurer are that the policy will usually be written on a nonstandard form (that is, not <b>from</b> the <b>Insurance</b> <b>Services</b> Office), and if the insurer collapses, its insureds in states in which it is nonadmitted will not enjoy certain types of protection available to insureds in the states (or countries) in which the insurer is admitted. However, for persons trying to obtain coverage for unusual risks, the choice is usually between a surplus line insurer or no coverage at all.|$|R
