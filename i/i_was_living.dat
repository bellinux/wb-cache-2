Delano introduced a political aspect to the character, about which he stated: [...] "...generally I {{was interested in}} commenting on 1980s Britain.

500|$|McIlrath {{wrote the}} video treatment, and remarked how the band at first {{had no idea}} {{what they wanted to do}} for the video due to the song's unique sound. McIlrath did know that since [...] "Swing Life Away" [...] has simple lyrics, he wanted the video to {{replicate}} the song's easygoing feel. The video was shot over a year after the release of Siren Song Of The Counter Culture, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song's parent album is released. Parts of the video were filmed at The Fireside Bowl, where Rise Against played some of their first concerts. Looking back on the video, McIlrath said: [...] "Parts of it are kind of cheesy...but it captured where I was at when that song was written - it was written when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in a house with four roommates in a bedroom and we were all just trying to figure out what to do with our lives." ...|$|E
500|$|Elias Kifle Maraim Beyene, a {{survivor}} from Ethiopia being {{asked about his}} memory of Michael Jackson after his death remembers: [...] "I won't ever forget Michael Jackson because his contribution to the song We are the World had a very significant effect on my life. I am 50 now but 25 years ago <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, which {{at that time was}} suffering from a long drought and famine. It was a terrible situation. Lots of people became sick and many more died. Around one million people in all were killed by the famine. In 1984 Michael Jackson, along with a number of other leading musicians, made the song We are the World to raise money for Africa. We received a lot of aid from the world and I {{was one of those who}} directly benefitted from it. The wheat flour that was distributed to the famine victims was different to the usual cereal we bought at the market. We baked a special bread from it. The local people named the bread after the great artist and it became known as Michael Bread. It was soft and delicious.|$|E

500|$|After {{searching for}} {{prospective}} collaborators, Madonna chose {{to work with}} Babyface, whose previous work with artists like Whitney Houston, Boyz II Men, and Toni Braxton had resulted in successful smooth R songs. She was also fond of Babyface's song, [...] "When Can I See You" [...] from his third studio album For the Cool in You (1994). The singer's management called Babyface {{to set up a}} meeting and see if they wanted to work together. Once met, both were surprised by their camaraderie and wanted to write songs. Madonna came over to Babyface's house and after a couple of days they came up with two songs. One of them was based on a piece of music composed by Babyface, but he was not sure about its musical direction. He made Madonna listen to the composition, and she found a way to take the song forward. Babyface clarified that [...] "t was just a beat and the chords. From there we collaborated and built it up... <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Beverly Hills and I created a little studio in my house, so she came over there to write." [...] Together they agreed that the first line of the song should be its title, and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] was written. The words were never repeated in the track again.|$|E
500|$|By 2001, Arulpragasam {{designed}} the cover for Elastica's last single [...] "The Bitch Don't Work", {{and went on}} the road with the band to video document their tour. The tour's supporting act, electroclash artist Peaches, introduced Arulpragasam to the Roland MC-505 and encouraged her to make music, a medium in which Arulpragasam lacked confidence. While holidaying together in Bequia in the Caribbean, Arulpragasam began experimenting with Frischmann's MC-505. She adopted her stage name, [...] "M.I.A.", standing for [...] "Missing In Acton" [...] during this time. In her 2012 book Arulpragasam writes, [...] "M.I.A. came to be because of my missing cousin. I wanted to make a film about where he was since he was M.I.A. (Missing in Action) in Sri Lanka. We were the same age, went to the same schools growing up. I was also living in Acton at the time. So <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Acton looking for my cousin missing in action." [...] Of her time in Bequia, she told [...] "I started going out to this chicken shed with a sound system. You buy rum through a hatch and dance in the street. They convinced me to come to church where people sing so amazingly. But I couldn’t clap along to hallelujah. I was out of rhythm. Someone said, ‘What happened to Jesus? I saw you dancing last night and you were totally fine.’ They stopped the service and taught me to clap in time. It was embarrassing". Returning to West London, where she shared an apartment with Frischmann, she began working with a simple set-up (a second-hand 4-track tape machine, the MC-505, and a radio microphone), composing and recording a six-song demo tape that included [...] "Lady Killa", [...] "M.I.A.", and [...] "Galang".|$|E

2500|$|Oliver was criticised for underestimating {{the cost}} of {{supposedly}} cheap food he encouraged poor people to prepare for themselves, also for an unrealistic view of poverty in Britain and round the Mediterranean. Cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe stated that Oliver's comments [...] "support damaging myths that poor people are only poor because they spend their money on the wrong things, rather than being constrained by time, equipment, knowledge or practicalities". Monroe added, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> on £10 a week for food, because of mistakes with housing benefit payments, I didn't need a hug. I needed a fiver, {{just to have a}} little bit more to eat.

2500|$|As a teenager, DeLillo was not {{interested}} in writing until a summer job as a parking attendant, where hours spent waiting and watching over vehicles led to a reading habit. In a 2010 interview with The Australian, DeLillo reflected on this period by saying [...] "I had a personal golden age of reading, in my 20s and my early 30s, and then my writing began to take up so much time". Among the writers DeLillo read and was inspired by in this period were James Joyce, William Faulkner, Flannery O'Connor, and Ernest Hemingway, who was a major influence on DeLillo's earliest attempts at writing in his late teens. As well as the influence of modernist fiction, DeLillo has also cited the influence of jazz music – [...] "guys like Ornette Coleman and Mingus and Coltrane and Miles Davis" [...] – and postwar cinema: [...] "Antonioni and Godard and Truffaut, and then in the '70s came the Americans, many of whom were influenced by the Europeans: Kubrick, Altman, Coppola, Scorsese and so on. I don't know how they may have affected the way I write, but I do have a visual sense." [...] On the influence of film, particularly European cinema, on his work, DeLillo has said, [...] "European and Asian cinemas of the 1960s shaped the way I think and feel about things. At that time <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in New York, I didn't have much money, didn't have much work, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in one room....I was a man in a small room. And I went to the movies a lot, watching Bergman, Antonioni, Godard. When I was little, in the Bronx, I didn't go to the cinema and I didn't think of the American films I saw as works of art. Perhaps, in an indirect way, cinema allowed me to become a writer." [...] DeLillo also credits his parents' leniency and acceptance of his desire to write for encouraging him to pursue a literary career: [...] "They ultimately trusted me to follow the course I’d chosen. This is something that happens if you’re the eldest son in an Italian family: You get a certain leeway, and it worked in my case." ...|$|E
2500|$|In early January 2013, Willie Frazer {{said that}} he and a group of loyalists planned to hold a protest outside the Irish {{parliament}} building, Leinster House, in Dublin and [...] "sarcastically" [...] ask for the Irish flag to be taken down. Frazer said [...] "it's a tongue-in-cheek gesture. It's to give Irish people a sense of how we feel. I would be very offended if <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Ireland and someone came and asked me to take the flag down. That’s exactly how we feel in Belfast. People keep telling us we're still part of the UK, yet here we are without a flag". In 2006, a march in Dublin, organised by Love Ulster, had sparked riots. The Progressive Unionist Party's Billy Hutchinson condemned the clashes, while his colleague, Phil Hamilton, criticised the PSNI for not deploying enough officers to the Short Strand area on 12 January to prevent violence. The UDA's Jimmy Birch told the BBCs Radio Ulster: [...] "Every time they call a tune, we take to the streets. We are wrecking our own areas, we fight with the police, we are burning our own cars and we stop our own people going to work and disrupt our own people's way of life. It is wrong, we need to step back and we need to stop being predictable." ...|$|E
2500|$|Named after a 1945 book {{of graphic}} {{black and white}} {{photographs}} by Weegee the band performed an aggressive mix of [...] "soundtrack themes, bluesy hard bop, speedy hardcore rock, squealing free jazz [...] metallic funk". Zorn stated that [...] "Naked City started with rhythm and blues/Spillane type things then went into this hard-core thing... because <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>living</b> in Japan and experiencing a lot of alienation and rejection... My interest in hard-core also spurred the urge to write shorter and shorter pieces." [...] This approach culminated {{in a string of}} [...] "hardcore miniatures", intense brief compositions often lasting less than a minute, 42 of which were featured on the EP, Torture Garden (1989). Some of these tracks had also featured on the band's debut Naked City and others would resurface on the band's next full-length release, Grand Guignol (1992), which also included performances of works by Claude Debussy, Alexander Scriabin, Orlande de Lassus, Charles Ives, and Olivier Messiaen. [...] The band's third album, Heretic (1992), featured more of these short improvisations produced for the soundtrack of an underground S/M film Jeux des Dames Cruelles. The band released a second EP, Leng Tch'e, in 1992 featuring a single composition which lasted just over half an hour. Radio, released in 1993, was the first Naked City album composed solely by Zorn, and featured tracks crediting a wide range of musical influences.|$|E
