It {{includes}} an international food market with over 100 stalls selling food and drink, and a large marquee with a kitchen area erected in Saxon Square. Here cooking demonstrations are given, sometimes by a celebrity chef: past guests have included Gary Rhodes and Jean-Christophe Novelli. The week-long festival is a community event which aims to educate people in healthy eating {{as well as the}} availability of foods. During the festival local chefs are invited <b>into</b> <b>schools</b> to demonstrate recipes; and throughout the weekend the marquee hosts a cookery workshop for 7–10-year olds.|$|E
5|$|On August3, the United States Weather Bureau {{issued a}} {{hurricane}} watch for coastal {{areas of the}} Big Island in Kau and Puna districts. As Dot swept by the Hawaiian islands, various gale warnings and small craft warnings shifted westward to reflect the hurricane's predicted path. Due to the storm's sudden northward shift in movement, hurricane warnings were issued for portions of Oahu and the Kauai channel before being issued for only the island of Kauai. All watches and warnings were discontinued on August7 after Dot weakened below hurricane intensity. Disaster workers in Oahu and Kauai were warned by civil defense agencies and the American Red Cross to prepare for emergency. Roughly 400people fled from the beaches of Kauai due {{to the threat of}} storm surge, with an additional 500people being evacuated by authorities as the storm neared the island. After the storm caused flooding in Kauai, nearly 1,000people evacuated out of submerged areas <b>into</b> <b>schools,</b> armories, and public facilities repurposed as emergency shelters.|$|E

Eliot was an administrative reformer, reorganizing the university's faculty <b>into</b> <b>schools</b> and departments and replacing recitations with lectures and seminars. During his forty-year presidency, the university vastly expanded its facilities, with laboratories, libraries, classrooms, and athletic facilities replacing simple colonial structures. Eliot attracted the support of major donors from among the nation's growing plutocracy, making it the wealthiest private university in the world.|$|E

25|$|Cantonese {{people also}} {{have their own}} schools of kung fu. Originally disorganized, the {{fighting}} techniques of Cantonese people were grouped into different schools between 18th to 19th century. At that time, due to ineptitude of the Qing Empire's government, pirates and bandits were rampant in the empire's fringe regions such as Lingnan. This resulted in Cantonese starting to want to protect themselves, and thus the proliferation of martial arts learning. It was when the Cantonese people organized their fighting techniques <b>into</b> <b>schools,</b> forming the martial arts schools seen among Cantonese today. Martial arts folk heroes from that period, such as Wong Fei-hung, are now popular topics of Cantonese films.|$|E
25|$|Following {{independence}} cricket remained {{very much}} a minority sport in Myanmar, and {{was nowhere to be}} seen between 1988 and 1995. In 2002 the game was seeing a resurgence, with a seven team league organised by former Bengal first class player Naresh Kumar, with some former first class players taking part in games attended by around 250 people. Cricket has also been featured on TV news reports. The Myanmar Cricket Federation received a visit from the ICC in 2004 and became an affiliate member of the organisation in 2006. The game is currently played primarily by ex-pats, but the game has recently been introduced <b>into</b> <b>schools.</b>|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the nineteenth}} century, the {{university}} was organized <b>into</b> <b>schools</b> of agriculture, engineering (mechanical, civil, and electrical), and pharmacy, and former U.S. President Benjamin Harrison was serving on the board of trustees. Purdue’s engineering laboratories included testing facilities for a locomotive and a Corliss steam engine, one of the most efficient engines of the time. The School of Agriculture was sharing its research with farmers throughout the state with its cooperative extension services and would undergo a period of growth over the following two decades. Programs in education and home economics were soon established, as well as a short-lived school of medicine. By 1925 Purdue had the largest undergraduate engineering enrollment in the country, a status it would keep for half a century.|$|E

Azad masterminded the creation of national programmes of school and college construction and spreading the enrolment of children and young adults <b>into</b> <b>schools,</b> to promote universal primary education. Elected to the lower house of the Indian Parliament, the Lok Sabha in 1952 and again in 1957, Azad supported Nehru's socialist economic and industrial policies, as well as the advancing social rights and economic opportunities for women and underprivileged Indians. In 1956, he served as president of the UNESCO General Conference held in Delhi. Azad spent the final years of his life focusing on writing his book India Wins Freedom, an exhaustive account of India's freedom struggle and its leaders, which was published in 1959.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{during the}} third stage of its {{development}} (1975-today), new schools and departments were founded along with the aforementioned Engineering Schools. Moreover, the university acquired {{a small number of}} departments which operated in the past as independent institutes of Higher Education. During this period, the Faculty of Fine Arts was established, along with all its constituent Schools (Drama, Film Studies, Music Studies, Visual and Applied Arts). Additionally, the School of Journalism and Mass Media Studies and the School of Physical Education and Sports Sciences were created as independent schools. Overall, the third stage of development of the Aristotle University is characterized not only by the establishment of new Faculties, Schools and Departments, but also by many major changes {{in the structure of the}} university itself. These changes include the downgrade of some former Faculties <b>into</b> <b>Schools</b> or Departments and the upgrade of others.|$|E
25|$|The giant {{trevally}} reaches {{sexual maturity}} at 54 to 61cm {{in length and}} {{three to four years}} of age, although many authors narrow this down to 60cm and three years of age. Sex ratio estimates from the Hawaiian Islands suggest the population is slightly skewed toward females, with the male:female ratio being 1:1.39. Spawning occurs during the warmer months in most locations, although the exact dates differ by location. In southern Africa, this occurs between July and March, with a peak between November and March; in the Philippines between December and January, with a lesser peak during June; and in Hawaii between April and November, with a major peak during May to August. Lunar cycles are also known to control the spawning events, with large schools forming in certain locations at specific phases of the moon in Hawaii and the Solomon Islands. Locations for spawning include reefs, the reef channels and offshore banks. Sampling of schools prior to spawning suggests the fish segregate <b>into</b> <b>schools</b> of only one sex, although the details are still unclear. Observations in the natural habitat found spawning occurred during the day immediately after and just before the change of tide when there were no currents. Giant trevally gathered in schools of over 100 individuals, although ripe individuals occurred slightly deeper; around 2–3 m above the seabed in groups of three or four, with one silver female being chased by several black males. Eventually, a pair would sink down to a sandy bottom, where eggs and sperm were released. The fish then diverged and swam away. Each individual appears to spawn more than once in each period, with only part of the gonads ripe in spawners. Fecundity is not known, although females are known to release several thousand eggs on capture during the spawning process. Eggs are described as pelagic and transparent in nature.|$|E

25|$|In {{the year}} 1978, the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) - a major charity {{supporting}} cancer {{research in the}} United Kingdom at the time, decided to provide an £800,000 endowment to support creation of a Chair of Medical Oncology in the Faculty of Medicine in Edinburgh. Following an open competition, the University of Edinburgh appointed John F. Smyth (at the time a senior lecturer in medical oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research in London) for that position on 1 April 1979. After a short visit to the University of Chicago, professor Smyth assumed his duties in Edinburgh on 1 October 1979 (a date that {{can be considered as}} the beginning of the Centre). Soon afterwards, additional posts were provided by the University and matched by appropriate staff positions by Lothian Health Board (NHS) to create first clinical service for medical oncology in Edinburgh. The service was based in the Western General Hospital where some beds and out-patient facilities were provided. In 1980 it was formally recognized as the Imperial Cancer Research Fund Medical Oncology Unit in Edinburgh with professor John Smyth as its director. This resulted in additional funding that allowed building of a small research laboratory which was commissioned in 1981. The laboratory was located in a portable cabin on the Western General Hospital campus. The main focus of the Unit was the development of more successful drug therapies for all forms of cancer and looking for new ways of reducing the side-effects of anti-cancer drugs. With generous support from Imperial Cancer Research Fund and other organisations, the Unit was steadily growing enabling clinical trials for promising anticancer therapeutics. For example, the Unit was responsible for the very first clinical trial of a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist, heralding in the dramatic changes in emesis control that subsequently followed the development of that class of compounds. In 1984 the Unit moved to a new location at {{the top floor of the}} MRC Human Genetics Unit building which allowed for expansion of laboratory research activities. After a successful ICRF review in 1996, it had been recognized that further extension of scientific activities of the Unit required even more space and prof. Smyth obtained permission to rise funds to create a new purpose designed building. The work started in 2000 and the new £7M building was officially opened in 2002 by The Princess Royal. It provides 3000 square meters of gross internal space and is a current base for majority of ECRC researchers. At that time (in 2002), following reorganisation of faculties <b>into</b> <b>schools</b> within the University of Edinburgh, the name Edinburgh Cancer Research Centre was created and used with reference to the Unit and the new building. In 2004 the successor of ICRF, Cancer Research UK, also started to refer to the Unit as the CRUK Clinical Cancer Centre to emphasize its status as a comprehensive cancer centre. In 2007 ECRC became part of the Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine. In 2010, following a successful bid, ECRC has been formally recognized as Cancer Research UK Centre and is known as Edinburgh Cancer Research UK Centre.|$|E
