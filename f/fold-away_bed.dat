25|$|By {{the end of}} the 1930s, {{railroads and}} carbuilders were debuting carbody and {{interior}} styles that could only be dreamed of before. In 1937, the Pullman Company delivered the first cars equipped with roomettes—that is, the car's interior was sectioned off into compartments, much like the coaches that were still in widespread use across Europe. Pullman's roomettes, however, were designed with the single traveler in mind. The roomette featured a large picture window, a privacy door, a single <b>fold-away</b> <b>bed,</b> a sink and small toilet. The roomette's floor space was barely larger than the space taken up by the bed, but it allowed the traveler to ride in luxury compared to the multilevel semiprivate berths of old.|$|E

5000|$|Internationally, the Slumbercoach can be {{compared}} to second-class or [...] "hard" [...] sleeper facilities on Asian and European lines, but economically comparable facilities such as those provided on the Train Bleu between Paris and the south of France, which de-emphasized privacy, and in place of this provided multiple-occupant couchette compartments with <b>fold-away</b> <b>beds.</b> The development of midlevel accommodation like the Slumbercoach has ceased, due to changing demand in mass transit.|$|R
