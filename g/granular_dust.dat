40|$|Objective: Applying a {{systematic}} review to identify studies eligible for meta-analysis {{of the association}} between occupational exposure to inorganic dust {{and the development of}} chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and conducting a meta-analysis. Data Sources: Searches of PubMed and Embase for the time period 1970 – 2010 yielded 257 cross-sectional and longitudinal studies on people exposed to inorganic dust at the workplace with data on lung function. These studies were independently abstracted and evaluated by two authors; any disagreement was resolved by a third reviewer. Of 55 publications accepted for meta-analysis, 27 investigated the effects of occupational exposure to biopersistent <b>granular</b> <b>dust</b> (bg-dust). Methods: A random effects meta-analysis allowed us to provide an estimate of the average exposure effect on spirometric parameters presented in forest plots. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed by using I 2 statistics, with I 2 > 25 % indicating significant heterogeneity. Publication bias was investigated by visual inspection of funnel plots. The influence of individual studies was assessed by dropping the respective study before pooling study-specific estimates. Results: The mean FEV 1 of workers exposed to bg-dust was 160 ml lower or 5. 7 % less than predicted compared t...|$|E

40|$|The study {{includes}} some 50 groups of {{male or female}} Wistar rats tested in three series. Except for one untreated group and 3 vehicle control groups, the animals were injected intraperitoneally (i. p.) once or repeatedly with dust suspensions and then examined, after lifetime observation up to 30 months, for tumours in the abdominal cavity. 1 <b>granular</b> <b>dust</b> (silicon carbide), 2 asbestos dusts (crocidolite, tremolite) and 11 vitreous fibre dust samples were administered. 5 of the vitreous fibre types were fine fibre fractions from 4 commercial insulation wools and 1 experimental wool, the others were prepared by milling glass microfibres, which have, per se, a small diameter range. The dosage per rat differed {{over a wide range}} in accordance with experience from earlier studies. The lowest dose was 0. 04 x 10 (9) crocidolite fibres in 0. 5 mg dust, and the highest amounted to 20 x 10 (9) glass fibres in 1000 mg divided into 40 weekly injections. Two mesotheliomas were found in a total of 395 rats treated with saline or granular silicon carbide (250 or 1000 mg). Eleven fibre dusts produced dose-dependent mesotheliomas at rates of up to 97 %, but the calculated fibre number > 5 micrometers in length required for inducing a 25 % tumour risk differed between the fibre samples tested in the relation of 1 to about 1000. UICC-like crocidolite heads the ranking order; the glass fibre B- 01, which possesses a low durability in the body, ends it together with a rather thin sample of glass fibre type B- 09.

Actinolite injected i. p. in a solution of polyvinylpyridine-N-oxide gave a lowe tumour incidence than when suspended only in saline, possibly due to inactivation of the fibre surface. Persistent glass fibres were less effective than actinolite having as similar fibre size distribution. On the other hand, relatively thick basalt fibres and ceramic fibres gave higher tumour incidences than expected. Wollastonite fibres were not carcinogenic, probably because of their low durability.

Addition of poly- 2 -vinylpyridine-N-oxide decreased inflammatory responses, fibrosis, and the incidence of pulmonary tumors induced by crystalline quartz to 21. 4 %. After repeated instillation of soluble, ultrafine amorphous silica (15 mg) a statistically significant tumor response (9. 4 %) was observed, although, the inflammatory response in the lung was not as persistently severe as in rats treated with carbon black. Instillation of ultrafine carbon black (5 mg) caused a lung tumor incidence of 15 %. In contrast to a preceding study using a dose of 66 mg coal dust, lung tumors were not detected after exposure to the same coal dust at a dose of 10 mg in this study. Pulmonary inflammatory responses to coal dust were very low indicating a mechanistic threshold {{for the development of}} lung tumors connected with particle related chronic inflammation. The animals treated with ultrafine carbon black and ultrafine amorphous silica showed significantly more severe lesions in non-cancerous endpoints when compared to animals treated with fine coal dust.

OBJECTIVES: Determination of a value of ‘low solubility’ {{and analysis of the}} inflammatory response in lungs including micro-/nanoscaled dusts. For TiO 2 (rutile-micro), TiO 2 (anatase-nano), Eu 2 O 3 (micro-nano mixed), BaSO 4 (micro), ZrO 2 (micro) and amorphous SiO 2 (nano) the solubility (day 3, 28 and 90) and inflammation (day 3 and 28) after intratracheal instillation in rats was analysed. Two doses of 0. 5 (non-overload) and 1. 5 μl (moderate overload) were administered. The differential cell count showed only slight inflammatory cell levels after treatment with TiO 2 (rutile) and BaSO 4. In contrast, the TiO 2 (anatase) showed a stronger response. The rare earth Eu 2 O 3 dust showed the strongest effect including a red-coloured lung lavage fluid. ZrO 2 and amorphous SiO 2 showed a strong acute response after 3 days, however, recovered mostly completely within 28 days. These data were validated by parallel subacute inhalations at same lung loads. GBS have to fulfill a ‘low solubility’ and a ‘non-significant inflammatory response’.

40|$|Background: Biological {{effects of}} {{tailor-made}} multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) without functionalization were investigated in vivo in a two-year carcinogenicity study. In the past, intraperitoneal carcinogenicity studies in rats using biopersistent <b>granular</b> <b>dusts</b> {{had always been}} negative, whereas a number of such studies with different asbestos fibers had shown tumor induction. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify possible carcinogenic effects of MWCNTs. We compared induced tumors with asbestos-induced mesotheliomas and evaluated their relevance for humans by immunohistochemical methods. Methods: A total of 500 male Wistar rats (50 per group) were treated once by intraperitoneal injection with 109 or 5 × 109 WHO carbon nanotubes of one of four different MWCNTs suspended in artificial lung medium, which was also used as negative control. Amosite asbestos (108 WHO fibers) served as positive control. Morbid rats were sacrificed and necropsy comprising all organs was performed. Histopathological classification of tumors and, additionally, immunohistochemistry were conducted for podoplanin, pan-cytokeratin, and vimentin to compare induced tumors with malignant mesotheliomas occurring in humans. Results: Treatments induced tumors in all dose groups, but incidences and times to tumor differed between groups. Most tumors were histologically and immunohistochemically classified as malignant mesotheliomas, revealing a predominantly superficial spread on the serosal surface of the abdominal cavity. Furthermore, most tumors showed invasion of peritoneal organs, especially the diaphragm. All tested MWCNT types caused mesotheliomas. We observed highest frequencies and earliest appearances after treatment with the rather straight MWCNT types A and B. In the MWCNT C groups, first appearances of morbid mesothelioma-bearing rats were only slightly later. Later during the two-year study, we found mesotheliomas also in rats treated with MWCNT D – the most curved type of nanotubes. Malignant mesotheliomas induced by intraperitoneal injection of different MWCNTs and of asbestos were histopathologically and immunohistochemically similar, also compared with mesotheliomas in man, suggesting similar pathogenesis. Conclusion: We showed a carcinogenic effect for all tested MWCNTs. Besides aspect ratio, curvature seems to be an important parameter influencing the carcinogenicity of MWCNTs...|$|R

Five male Wistar rats per group (total of 500 rats) were treated once by an intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of a low (1 x 109 WHO fibers) and high (5 x 109 WHO fibers) dose each of MWCNTs (MWCNT 1, 2, 3 and 3 a) suspended in artificial lung medium, also used as negative control. Amosite asbestos (0. 1 x 109 WHO fibers) served as positive control. It {{is well known that}} only fibrous but not <b>granular</b> <b>dusts</b> can cause tumors in rats after i. p. application. Moribund rats were sacrificed and necropsy comprising all organs was performed. A histopathological classification of tumors and in addition, immunohistochemistry was conducted to compare the induced tumors with mesotheliomas occurring in humans. The treatments induced mesotheliomas in all dose groups, whereas incidence and time to tumor were different between the groups. Rats treated with MWCNTs 3 (L= 8. 57 mm; D: 0. 085 mm) and 3 a (L= 9. 3 mm; D= 0. 062 mm) were killed moribund between 8 and 12 months after treatment and exhibited high tumor incidences in the low and high dose groups. The survival time of rats treated with MWCNTs 2 (L= 10. 24 mm; D= 0. 04 mm) was even longer but resulted also in high tumor incidences in both dose groups in relation to the positive control. For MWCNTs 1 (L= 7. 9 mm; D= 0. 037 mm) the survival time for the low dose was similar to the amosite asbestos (L= 13. 95 mm; D= 0. 39 mm) positive control. Overall, tumor incidences were lower than for MWCNTs 2, 3 and 3 a.

Each exposed group was repeatedly instilled intratracheally with a suspension of one type and dose of 13 non-mining dusts differing {{in at least one}} of the following properties: chemical composition, density, specific surface area, and mean particle size. Eleven of the 13 dusts were classified as respirable granular bio-durable particles without known significant specific toxicity (abbreviation of the nine-word definition: GBP). In 579 (58 %) lungs of 1002 rats which survived more than 26 weeks after the first instillation of GBP, at least one primary lung tumor type was observed, and in 306 (31 %) at least two types. Three benign tumor types were diagnosed in the 579 tumor-bearing rats: bronchiolo-alveolar adenoma in 46 %, cystic keratinizing epithelioma in 53 %, and non-keratinizing epithelioma in 2. 6 % of the rats. Two of three malignant tumor types (bronchiolo-alveolar carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma) occurred in 46 % and 31 % of the tumor-bearing rats, respectively, and adenosquamous carcinoma was diagnosed in 0. 9 %. Numerous lungs with a malignant tumor also showed one or more benign tumor types. In addition, single or multiple metastases from primary tumors of other sites (mainly carcinoma of the uterus) were diagnosed in 14 % of the 1002 lungs. The proportionate incidences of the four predominantly diagnosed tumor types were compared with three summarized experimental groups which were exposed either to carbon black (two size classes), to titanium dioxide (two size classes), or to the total of the other nine GBP.

40|$|Fine {{fractions}} of dusts occurring in occupational settings are of high relevance {{for the safety}} at workplaces and therefore are strictly regulated by authorities. Appropriate threshold values should guarantee that lung diseases are not induced in workers exposed up to long periods. Respirable biopersistent <b>granular</b> <b>dusts</b> (GBS) are defined as respirable fine dusts with a negligible solubility in physiological lung fluid that do not exhibit a specific chemistry-related toxicity at volumetric non-overload conditions. In 2012, the MAK Commission derived a new threshold value of 0. 3 mg/m 3 for GBS, recognizing that in concentrations exceeding the physiological lung clearance capacity GBS can cause chronic inflammation and increase the lung cancer risk in animal experiments. - The objectives were to investigate, whether a general value for the term 'low soluble' can be derived (e. g. a solubility in lung fluid of approx. 1 mg/l). In addition, measuring the inflammatory response in lung lavage fluid, it was investigated whether nanoscaled dusts could possibly fulfill the criteria {{to be included in}} the GBS class. - Six micro- and nanoscaled dusts (some of them of commercial relevance) were compared analysing the solubility in the lung fluid (day 3, 28 and 90) and the lung toxicity after intratracheal instillation in rats (day 3 and 28) : TiO 2 (rutile, micro), TiO 2 (anatase, nano), Eu 2 O 3 (micro-nano mixed), BaSO 4 (micro), ZrO 2 (micro) and amorphous SiO 2 (nano). Two doses of 0. 5 and 1. 5 l per rat were administered to Wistar rats; these volume doses resulted in a non-overload and moderate overload of lungs, resp. - The differential cell count showed only slight inflammatory cell levels after treatment with TiO 2 (rutile) and BaSO 4 (PMN 30 % after 3 days).

Umweltforschungsplan des Bundesministeriums für Umwelt, Naturschutz und Reaktorsicherheit. November 2005. [URL] The results of the standard approach to histological sampling in rodent carcinogenicity inhalation studies were compared to those obtained after supplemental evaluation of step sections at intervals of 250 mum through the entire lung. Seven lung tissue specimens (six sections) each of 251 rats (55 rats of the control group, 53 rats of the group treated with quartz DQ 12, 56 rats of the group treated with quartz DQ 12 and PVNO (poly- 2 -vinylpyridine-N-oxide), 53 rats of the group treated with amorphous SiO(2), and 17 rats each of the groups treated with coal dust and carbon black) were evaluated by light microscopy. At least 60 hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) -stained sections per lung were evaluated of 99 female rats (30 rats of the control group, 7 rats each of the groups treated with quartz, quartz and PVNO, and carbon black, 31 rats of the group treated with amorphous SiO(2), and 17 rats treated with coal dust). For the neoplastic and pre-neoplastic lesions detected in the serial slides an approximate value of the whole tumor volume was calculated. The detection of tumors with a diameter of 0. 25 mm was possible. Based on the size distribution of 75 tumor volumes, the probability of detecting a tumor was 86 % when using 12 sections. The addition of step sections enhanced the tumor detection rate from 17 to a total number of 44 lung tumors in the quartz-treated rats, from 6 to 10 in the quartz- and PVNO-treated rats, from 4 to 11 in the amorphous SiO(2) -treated rats, and from 4 to 10 in the carbon black-treated rats. Both the tumor multiplicity and the number of rats with pre-neoplastic lesions increased. These additional data corroborated the initial findings in all experimental groups and provided statistically significant results confirming the equivocal evidence of carcinogenic activity of amorphous SiO(2) in female Wistar rats. This technique offered accurate information on the incidence, histological type, size, and location of proliferative lesions in the entire lung, but the benefit must be balanced against the extra financial effort...|$|R

40|$|The {{carcinogenicity}} {{experiment with}} rats, {{as the last}} part of a series of investigations, was to provide information on dust carcinogenicity. Quartz and ultrafine amorphous SiO 2 as specifically toxic dusts were selected for this experiment, and in addition two <b>granular</b> <b>dusts</b> without known specific toxicity, but with marked differences in particle size and specific surface: ultrafine industrial carbon black (mean size 0. 014 µm, BET surface approx. 300 m²/g) and non-quartz-containing coal dust (mean size 4 µm, BET surface 4. 1 m²/g). In addition, one quartz group was treated with the silicosis inhibitor poly- 2 -vinylpyridine-N-oxide (PVNO), so as to verify whether PVNO also does not inhibit quartz-induced carcinogenesis at low quartz doses, as previously observed with high quartz doses. The dusts, suspended in NaCl solution, were instilled to the trachea of Wistar rats at relatively low doses: 3 mg quartz, 15 mg amorphous SiO 2 (split between 30 instillations of 0. 5 mg each at intervals of 2 weeks because of the short retention time in the lung), 5 mg UF carbon black and 10 mg coal dust (split between 10 instillations at weekly intervals). After 9 months, 10 animals of each group were killed and examined for cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and for pulmonary lesions. All other animals lived for their normal lifetime until termination of the experiment in month 29 after the experimental start date. Out of the animals that had reached an old age, only 17 from each group could be examined, and investigations were performed at different levels of intensity. In three groups (amorphous SiO 2, coal dust, control), 60 sections per lung, instead of the routine 6 sections, were investigated for tumors and preneoplastic lesions, aiming to detect all tumor-bearing animals in particular in the group treated with amorphous SiO 2, which so far had produced "negative“ results. The results obtained are in line with the expected differences between intensive (60 sections investigated, 6 animals with lung tumors, 7 with preneoplastic lesions) and routine histological analyses (only every 10 th section analyzed, 2 animals with lung tumors, no preneoplastic lesions). The non-significant carcinogenicity indicated by the routine investigation, however, is in contrast to the findings of inflammation and fibrosis, which were found at degrees roughly corresponding to those in the two groups treated with quartz and PVNO and with carbon black, where carcinogenicity (47 % and 35 %, respectively) was also clearly in the positive range. The number of neutrophil granulocytes (PMN) in lung lavage fluid was even 66 % higher with amorphous SiO 2 than in the group treated with quartz but not with PVNO. The question thus arises as to whether there is an additional factor contributing to tumor induction in the case of dusts that persist in the lung. This factor could e. g. lie in a different type of inflammation. Several authors have concluded from their findings that the epithelial cells absorb particles, leading to a direct toxic effect which may also occur without inflammation or in parallel with it. The new results do not support the hypothesis that chronic inflammation of any origin acts to the lung as a carcinogenic agent whose potency could be quantified with the presently common diagnostic methods. PVNO, in principle, inhibited quartz carcinogenicity, but quantitatively the effect was only moderate. There is a difference here compared to previous investigations, in which the inhibitory effect of PVNO on the cytotoxic and fibrogenic actions of quartz had been stronger, resulting in a reduction even to the effect of "inert dust". Ultrafine carbon black produced tumors in 35 % of the 17 animals examined with the routine diagnostic methods, and this result was obtained with a lung dust dose that was only about 1. 5 times the volume limit value for fine dust defined by the MAK commission. Coal dust, whose calculated mean particle size is larger by a factor of almost 300, induced no tumors at the low dosage in the 17 animals examined. This non-positive finding though cannot be interpreted {{in the sense of a}} tolerable cancer risk of less than 1 : 1. 000 if the MAK value is complied with, because an approx. 7 -fold dose proved to be strongly carcinogenic in a previous experiment with a tumor incidence of 57 % and the confidence interval is large with so small a number of animals...|$|R
40|$|The panel {{bed filter}} (PBF) is a {{granular}} filter patented by A. M. Squires {{in the late}} sixties. PBFs consist of louvers with stationary, <b>granular</b> beds. <b>Dust</b> is deposited in the top layers and on the bed surface when gas flows through. PBFs are resistant to high temperatures, variations in the gas flow and hot particles. The filter is cleaned by releasing a pressure pulse {{in the opposite direction}} of the bulk flow (a puff back pulse). A new louver geometry patented by A. M. Squires is the filter tray louvers. The new design is believed to reduce the pressure drop and the number of louvers, and to make the filter more compact. We have designed and built a laboratory scale PBF with filter tray louvers based on the patent. Experiments with the prototype show that the new louver can be cleaned with a puff back pulse. A PBF system for a hypothetical biomass combustion plant has been designed. The heat from the flue gas will be used for district heating. The proposed PBF system design consists of double-sided modules with 46 filter tray louvers on top of each other. Five modules are mounted together in module columns, sharing the same clean gas duct and puff back pipe. The granular medium chosen is Sintered Bauxite 20 / 40 (SB). The module columns are placed in an enveloping house. SB and dust fall into bins {{in the bottom of the}} enveloping house during puff back cleaning. A vacuum pneumatic conveying system brings the dust and SB to the top of the filter. Dust and SB are separated in a sieve. Dust is deposited, and SB is transported back to the modules. NTNU is currently involved in the BioSOFC project. The objective of this project is to increase efficiency in energy production from biomass by using producer gas from a biomass gasification plant in a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell. Field tests will be performed at a plant in Güssing, Austria. A PBF will be used for gas filtration. The operating temperature will be 500 °C to avoid tar condensation. We have performed heating experiments on the BioSOFC filter system. The results were not satisfactory, as the temperature in the filter ranged from 384 to 625 °C. The filter system was due to be shipped, and new tests could not be performed. This work proposes that modifications to the heating cable circuits are made, and new heating tests are performed before the field testing. </p...|$|R
