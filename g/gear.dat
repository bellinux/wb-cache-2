5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing <b>gear</b> or belly-land the aircraft with the <b>gear</b> retracted. They decided that having the landing <b>gear</b> down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing <b>gear</b> lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing <b>gear</b> is lost, the <b>gear</b> will fall down slightly and rest on the landing <b>gear</b> doors. Placing the regular landing <b>gear</b> handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing <b>gear</b> will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing <b>gear</b> to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the <b>gear</b> with the alternative system. Although the <b>gear</b> deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Wildhaber-Novikov <b>gears</b> having {{circular}} flanks {{hold out}} a very promising {{future in the}} field of <b>gearing</b> for power transmission in very heavily loaded machineries. In order to optimize the profile parameters of these <b>gears,</b> a photoelastic investigation was carried out.

Included were the models with various profile radii and fillet radii at different pressure angles.

It was observed that high pressure angles, when used for Wildhaber-Novikov <b>gears</b> having comparatively smaller profile radii, produce high flank stresses. <b>Gears</b> with larger profile radii, at smaller pressure angles were seen to have a high value for the ratio of flank stress to the bending stress.
