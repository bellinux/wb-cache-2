5|$|The allied generals' dispatch, {{and other}} Parliamentarian accounts, stated that 300 of their {{soldiers}} were killed. One of those mortally wounded among the Parliamentarians was Sir Thomas Fairfax's brother, Charles. Another was Cromwell's nephew, Valentine Walton, who {{was struck by}} a cannonball <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Cromwell was present when he died afterwards, and wrote a famous letter to the soldier's father, Cromwell's brother-in-law, also named Valentine Walton, which briefly described the battle and then informed the father of the son's last words and death.|$|E
5|$|In the Fourth Test at Headingley, England batted {{first on}} a pitch {{regarded}} as being ideal for strokeplay, and Australia's bowlers had little {{success on the}} first day. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Johnston appeared to be having back problems. He had bowled the most overs of any bowler on the tour and his loss would have meant a heavy workload for his remaining colleagues. His apparent discomfort led onlookers to opine {{that he should have}} been given more rest in the county matches. After an opening partnership of 143, England consolidated to reach 1/268 in the last over of the day before Johnston removed Washbrook for 143. Johnston did not taste further success in the first innings and ended with 1/86 from 38 overs as the home team ended on 496, their highest score of the series.|$|E
5|$|Large crowds {{started to}} gather <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> {{including}} {{many people who}} had travelled to Bristol to see the spectacle. There was a general atmosphere of anticipation as the Royal Emblem was unfurled. The processional route had been cleaned and Temple Street decorated with flags, banners, flowers and ribbons. Boys of the City School and girls of Red Maids were stationed in a neat orderly formation down {{the entire length of}} the Exchange. The route was a mass of colour and everybody was out on the streets as it was a public holiday. The atmosphere of gaiety even allowed thoughts to drift away from the problems of political dissension in London.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, in {{the area}} to the east of the Jordan River garrisoned by the Ottoman Fourth Army, two Bristol Fighters {{reporting}} <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> all Ottoman camps {{in the area}}, were quiet. After attacking a mass of cavalry at Ain es Sir they returned to base by flying over the Wadi Fara road. Here they dropped their remaining bombs on a column of 50 motor lorries, moving eastwards along the road towards the Jisr ed Damieh bridge over the Jordan River. A direct hit on one of the lorries blocked the road and in the late afternoon another two Bristol Fighters continued this attack.|$|E
5|$|On October18, another {{period of}} {{intensification}} took {{place as the}} storm neared the northern Philippines. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Elsie was upgraded to a super typhoon, a storm with winds of at least 240km/h (150mph). Hours before making landfall in Luzon, the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 5 super typhoon with winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a barometric pressure of 898hPa (mbar). The peak intensity of Elsie was assessed by the JMA at the same time. They reported that the typhoon attained winds of 175km/h (115mph 10-minute sustained) and a minimum pressure of 915hPa (mbar). The center of Elsie crossed the Philippine coastline at around 0300UTC on October19.|$|E
5|$|Hotchkiss driver Elliott Shepard, who {{finished}} {{the first day}} in fourth, less than four minutes behind Nazzaro, spent half-an-hour working on his car {{at the start of}} the second day, fitting new tyres and changing liquids. On the eighth lap, he ran off the wooden planking at Saint-Calais but was able to resume; a wheel failure later in the lap caused him to run into a bank of earth and forced him to retire. Panhard driver Georges Teste crashed <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> and retired, as did Claude Richez of Renault; the sole Gobron-Brillié of Rigolly suffered radiator damage on lap seven and was forced out of the race. After two laps' running on the second day, second-placed Clément had established a 23-minute lead over Nazzaro, but this was reduced to three minutes on the following lap. Despite Nazzaro passing Clément on lap ten, a refuelling stop for the FIAT soon after put Clément back in front. Nazzaro passed again, and led Clément into the last lap of the race by less than a minute.|$|E

5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of the abduction, Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E

25|$|Common {{box turtles}} are {{predominantly}} terrestrial reptiles {{that are often}} seen <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> or after rain, when they emerge from the shelter of rotting leaves, logs, or a mammal burrow to forage.

While tea is the second most consumed beverage on Earth after water, in many cultures it is also consumed at elevated social events, such as the tea party.|$|E
25|$|On day 3, England's bowlers {{carried on}} {{from where the}} batsmen left off. Graeme Smith was caught off a rising Anderson {{delivery}} <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> to get things going, and all the bowlers contributed from there. Neil McKenzie produced a gritty 40 before being bowled round his legs by Monty Panesar. AB de Villiers scored freely before being very well caught by James Anderson off the bowling of Monty Panesar, and Ashwell Prince compiled a determined century to give the South African innings some resemblance of respectability.|$|E

At 1:40pm, a severe weather watch was issued for the Edmonton area, including Leduc County, Parkland County, and Strathcona County. The watch was later upgraded to a warning at 2:45pm as the line of storms approached the area. As the cluster of storms approached the Leduc area, a violent cell rapidly developed ahead of the main line of storms and sharply turned northward.|$|E
25|$|Latif's team next {{assignment}} was the ICC Intercontinental Cup and Afghanistan play Scotland in the final. Latif stated that Afghanistan {{likes to play}} aggressive cricket and that the players are mentally very tough and hate to lose. On 2 December the match against Scotland started and because of Hamid Hassan Scotland were bowled out for 212. More than half of Scotland's runs came from Neil McCallum who scored 104*. Afghanistan {{got off to a}} good start but collapsed to 171 all out, giving Scotland a 41-run lead. Despite this another great bowling performance from Hassan and Samiullah Shenwari meant that Scotland were skittled for just 82 in their second innings. On the third day Afghanistan sealed victory <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> with seven-wickets in hand courtesy of a superb 56* by Mohammad Shahzad.|$|E
25|$|As noted above, the Fiesta Bowl {{was usually}} {{played in the}} early {{afternoon}} (MST). At the time, the structure of the New Year's Day games saw the Fiesta and Cotton Bowls played first, with the Rose Bowl starting around 4:45pm and the Orange and Sugar Bowls played at night at the same time. NBC at the time was the television home for three of the aforementioned bowls, and if the national title was to be decided in one of them airing the Fiesta Bowl <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day</b> would have been of little benefit. This brought about the shift in dates to the 2nd of January, which ensured the game would not face any competition from any other bowl game that might have been played at the time and helped it gain the record-setting audience it pulled in.|$|E

25|$|Walsh won the toss and batted, {{and the two}} new openers {{were soon}} back in the pavilion, Caddick and Fraser picking up the wickets in their first spells, leaving the home side 12/2 and {{bringing}} Lara to the crease <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day.</b> By the close of play, he was still there, 164 not out, had added 179 with Jimmy Adams (59), and was already dominating his partnership with Keith Arthurton (47). These two added 187 for the fourth wicket as Lara despatched the bowling to {{all parts of the}} ground, his second century coming in just 131 balls. Chanderpaul (75*) joined him in the last session of the second day, as Lara progressed to 320, and they continued the next morning, adding a total of 219 before Lara was finally dismissed by Caddick for a new individual Test batting record of 375, and Walsh promptly declared.|$|E
25|$|After tea Australia {{continued}} {{to settle into}} their batting rhythm as Hussey reached his 50 in the 64th over. England began to lose the advantage they had established <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> with runs coming more easily to Australia. In the 73rd over Hussey survived a dramatic run out chance {{which had to be}} referred to the third umpire as he slid his bat back into his crease {{a fraction of a second}} before Geraint Jones broke the stumps off a James Anderson throw-in. It was not until after the new ball had been taken in the 83rd over that England got a breakthrough. Matthew Hoggard was again the successful bowler, claiming Ponting for 142 and later Hussey for 91 in the 91st over. After the fall of Hussey's wicket, Michael Clarke and Adam Gilchrist established themselves at the crease to end the day on 30 and 13 respectively. The Australian score was 312 for 5, 40 runs short of the follow-on target.|$|E
25|$|Miguel was 20 {{years old}} when he first {{challenged}} the liberal institutions established after the 1820 revolution, which may have been part of a wider strategy by the queen. He was {{at the head of the}} counter-revolution of 1823, known as the Vilafrancada, which erupted on May 27, 1823 in Vila Franca de Xira. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>day,</b> Miguel joined the 23rd Infantry Regiment, commanded by Brigadier Ferreira Sampaio (later Viscount of Santa Mónica) in Vila Franca, where he declared his support for an absolutist monarchy. He immediately called on General Pampluna (later Marquis of Subserra) to join him and his cause. The general, not a fan of the liberal constitution, obeyed his summons and within five days he controlled the insurrectionary forces. The prince, supported by the queen, went so far as to demand the abdication of the king, who, faithful to his earlier oath, wanted to maintain the 1822 Constitution, despite the growing support for absolutist forces in Vila Franca.|$|E
