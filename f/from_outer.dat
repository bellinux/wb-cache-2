5|$|Jonathan Gems, who had {{previously}} written multiple unproduced screenplays for director Tim Burton, came up with his own idea for a Mars Attacks film in 1993. The writer pitched both concepts of Mars Attacks and Dinosaurs Attack! to Burton, who both decided that Dinosaurs Attack! would be too similar to Jurassic Park (1993). Burton, who was busy preparing Ed Wood (1994), believed that Mars Attacks! would be a perfect opportunity {{to pay homage to}} the films of Edward D. Wood, Jr., especially Plan 9 <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space (1959), and other 1950s science fiction B movies, such as Invaders from Mars (1953), It Came <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space (1953), The War of the Worlds (1953), Target Earth (1954), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956).|$|E

5|$|While {{eating at}} the Sci-Fi Dine-In, guests watch film clips from 1950s and 1960s science fiction films, B horror films, monster movies, pseudo-documentaries, bizarre newsreels, and {{animated}} cartoons, {{all on a}} loop that lasts 47 minutes. The film clips are taken from such films as The Blob, Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Teenagers <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space, The Amazing Colossal Man, Plan 9 <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space, Invasion of the Saucer Men, and Cat-Women of the Moon. The original Attack of the 50 Foot Woman trailer is also included. The clips are shown on a large projection screen. During Star Wars Weekends, a special breakfast is offered called the Star Wars Dine-In Galactic Breakfast, during which guests can interact with Star Wars characters and watch clips from the Star Wars films.|$|E
5|$|Wood {{shoots a}} film with Lugosi outside his home. When Wood and company attend the premiere for Bride of the Monster, an angry mob chases {{them out of}} the theater. Lugosi passes away, leaving Wood without a star. Wood convinces his landlord, a church leader named Reynolds, that funding Wood's script for Grave Robbers <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space would result in a box office success, and {{generate}} enough money for Reynolds' dream project. Dr. Tom Mason, O'Hara's chiropractor, is chosen to be Lugosi's stand-in for resembling Lugosi. Wood and the Baptists have conflicts over the title and content of the script which they want to have changed to Plan 9 <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space, along with Ed's B movie directing style, his casting decisions and his transvestism. Wood leaves the set to go to the nearest bar, where he encounters his idol, Orson Welles. Filming for Plan 9 finishes with Ed taking action against his producers. After attending the premiere of Plan 9, Wood and O'Hara go to Las Vegas to get married.|$|E

5|$|In the North Pacific, {{the longest}} {{reported}} were three 22.9m (75ft) males, two caught off California between 1919 and 1926 {{and the other}} caught off Alaska in 1925, and a 24.7m (81ft) female also caught off California, while the longest reliably measured were a 21m (69ft) male caught off British Columbia in 1959 and a 22.9m (75ft) female caught off central California between 1959 and 1970. Whales historically seen in Yellow Sea could have been distinct <b>from</b> <b>outer</b> Pacific populations due to their smaller size of around 20m or more at near maximum, and breeding season in these regions was mainly in winter.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In Theater Restaurant is a theme {{restaurant}} at Disney's Hollywood Studios, {{one of the}} four main theme parks at Walt Disney World in Bay Lake, Florida, United States. Established in May 1991, the restaurant is modeled after a 1950s drive-in theater. Walt Disney Imagineering designed the booths to resemble convertibles of the period, and some servers act as carhops while wearing roller skates. While eating, guests watch a large projection screen displaying film clips from such 1950s and 1960s films as Frankenstein Meets the Space Monster, Plan 9 <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space, and Attack of the 50 Foot Woman.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the endomembrane system {{is linked to the}} origin of eukaryotes {{themselves}} and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the {{origin of the}} endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved <b>from</b> <b>outer</b> membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted. This OMV-based model for the origin of the endomembrane system is currently the one that requires the least amount of novel inventions at eukaryote origin and explains the many connections of mitochondria with other compartments of the cell.|$|E

5|$|Unlike Earth, Venus lacks a {{magnetic}} field. Its ionosphere separates the atmosphere <b>from</b> <b>outer</b> {{space and the}} solar wind. This ionised layer excludes the solar magnetic field, giving Venus a distinct magnetic environment. This is considered Venus's induced magnetosphere. Lighter gases, including water vapour, are continuously blown away by the solar wind through the induced magnetotail. It is speculated that the atmosphere of Venus up to around 4billion years ago was more {{like that of the}} Earth with liquid water on the surface. A runaway greenhouse effect may have been caused by the evaporation of the surface water and subsequent rise of the levels of other greenhouse gases.|$|E
5|$|Among Uranus's moons, Titania is {{intermediate}} {{in brightness}} between the dark Oberon and Umbriel {{and the bright}} Ariel and Miranda. Its surface shows a strong opposition surge: its reflectivity decreases from 35% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 25% at an angle of about 1°. Titania has a relatively low Bond albedo of about 17%. Its surface is generally slightly red in color, but less red than that of Oberon. However, fresh impact deposits are bluer, while the smooth plains situated on the leading hemisphere near Ursula crater and along some grabens are somewhat redder. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter by 8%. However, this difference {{is related to the}} smooth plains and may be accidental. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering caused by bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites over the age of the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Titania is more likely related to accretion of a reddish material coming <b>from</b> <b>outer</b> parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would be deposited predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Hammer quickly {{sought to}} {{capitalise}} on its good fortune with a sequel. Staff member Jimmy Sangster pitched {{a story about}} a monster emerging from the Earth's core. However, when the company asked Nigel Kneale for permission to use the character of Quatermass, he refused, not wanting to lose control of his creation. Nevertheless, the film went ahead, as X the Unknown (1956), again capitalising on the 'X' Certificate in its title and featuring a newly created scientist character, very much in the Quatermass mould, played by Dean Jagger. Quatermass did eventually return to cinema screens in Quatermass 2 (1957) and Quatermass and the Pit (1967), both of which had screenplays written by Nigel Kneale and based on serials originally written by him and presented by BBC Television. Rival British film companies also tried to cash in with science fiction films of their own, including Satellite in the Sky, The Gamma People and Fire Maidens <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space (all 1956).|$|E

5|$|Oberon is the second-darkest large moon of Uranus after Umbriel. Its surface shows {{a strong}} {{opposition}} surge: its reflectivity decreases from 31% at a phase angle of 0° (geometrical albedo) to 22% {{at an angle}} of about 1°. Oberon has a low Bond albedo of about 14%. Its surface is generally red in color, except for fresh impact deposits, which are neutral or slightly blue. Oberon is, in fact, the reddest among the major Uranian moons. Its trailing and leading hemispheres are asymmetrical: the latter is much redder than the former, because it contains more dark red material. The reddening of the surfaces is often a result of space weathering caused by bombardment of the surface by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Oberon is more likely caused by accretion of a reddish material spiraling in <b>from</b> <b>outer</b> parts of the Uranian system, possibly from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere.|$|E
5|$|Ted (Josh Radnor) is at {{the clinic}} to remove his lower-back {{butterfly}} tattoo, where he is attracted to his doctor, Stella (Sarah Chalke). They agree {{to go to a}} movie, Plan 9 <b>from</b> <b>Outer</b> Space, but Ted does not realize Stella had brought her friends along with her, and it was not a date. At the next session, Ted suggests waiting till his ten sessions are over before asking her out, but Stella tells him she will still say no. Ted still feels that over ten weeks, she will start to like him, so decides to keep trying. Even though the first five sessions go well, Stella confirms her answer is still no. Ted decides that being nice to the receptionist, Abby (Britney Spears), would {{be a good way to}} let Stella see his good side, but instead, Abby starts to show interest in him. Upset that this didn't work, Ted tries using a self-help book he saw in Stella's clinic. When he tries talking to her about this, she reveals it isn't her book, and she detests it, while Abby confirms that Ted was reading the book in the reception.|$|E
5|$|The inner Solar System's {{period of}} giant impacts {{probably}} {{played a role}} in the Earth acquiring its current water content (~6kg) from the early asteroid belt. Water is too volatile to have been present at Earth's formation and must have been subsequently delivered <b>from</b> <b>outer,</b> colder parts of the Solar System. The water was probably delivered by planetary embryos and small planetesimals thrown out of the asteroid belt by Jupiter. A population of main-belt comets discovered in 2006 has been also suggested as a possible source for Earth's water. In contrast, comets from the Kuiper belt or farther regions delivered not more than about 6% of Earth's water. The panspermia hypothesis holds that life itself may have been deposited on Earth in this way, although this idea is not widely accepted.|$|E
