5|$|Kane's former youth coach Alex Inglethorpe {{has said}} of him:When {{he first came}} into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved {{slightly}} awkwardly, {{he was a bit}} cumbersome. But look closer, {{he had a lot of}} ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a holding midfielder.|$|E

In five previous Test series in 1999 and 2003, he averaged 98.71, with four hundreds. He also averaged 42.80 in 25 ODIs from four tours—1995, 1999, 2003 and the 2007 World Cup. After eight months of consecutive cricket from the World Twenty20, Ponting was surprised about <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was feeling, despite believing {{that he would be}} weary from the amount of cricket he had played.|$|E
500|$|Nieuwendyk was {{regarded}} as a leader throughout his career. [...] He was the captain of the Flames for four seasons, and his teammates in Dallas praised him as a player who would help guide the younger players as they began their careers. His presence was considered an important factor in New Jersey's 2003 Stanley Cup championship. Devils' general manager Lou Lamoriello praised his impact {{both on and off the}} ice: [...] "Certainly (the tangibles were) the quality player he was even at that time, <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was defensively as well as always finding a way to get big goals. It was also about <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was on faceoffs. And the intangibles, which are really more tangible than anything, are what he brought in the locker room from leadership and unselfishness. It was obvious that when he didn't play he was still so active in his support. He's genuine in every sense of the word. He was a true team player." [...] Nieuwendyk was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2011, and his uniform number 25 was honoured by the Calgary Flames on March 7, 2014, as he was named to the organization's [...] "Forever a Flame" [...] program.|$|E

I watch him on tapes and it's just ridiculous <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was compared to the guys he was playing against.

500|$|Crumley joined Bristol City, newly {{promoted}} to the Second Division for 1923–24, as a backup to Frank Vallis. By 13 October, with Bristol City already bottom {{of the table and}} both Vallis and Robert Goddard already tried in goal, Crumley made his debut in a 1–1 draw with Southampton. According to the Western Daily Press, he had nothing to do, so [...] "we [...] yet to learn... <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> is when asked to meet League requirements". He kept his place for the next match, a 1–0 defeat to Fulham, in which he exhibited a tendency to rush off his line when he should not, but that was his last appearance in the League side.|$|E

Petty said, [...] "Pearson could beat you on a short track, he could beat you on a superspeedway, he could beat you on a road course, he could beat you on a dirt track. It didn't hurt as bad to lose to Pearson as it did {{to some of the}} others, because I knew <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was."

500|$|Darren {{came in for}} casting {{and began}} talking about knowing where to source the {{appropriate}} tuxedos, {{and that he could}} wear a pair of Dean Martin's shoes that he owned. During the course of the meeting, Behr became convinced that Darren was performing the Fontaine piece, having moved into it seamlessly. Darren had deliberately avoiding simply reading the script, as he disliked doing cold reads; instead, he had intentionally improvising things that he felt that the character would say. After Darren left, Behr excitedly told the other writers <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was, but that perhaps they should still see other actors. Producer Hans Beimler replied, [...] "Are you out of your mind? What are you talking about? Vic Fontaine was just in the room. There's no question, there's no question! He's the guy!" ...|$|E

[...] However, Heigl tried to talk Knight out of leaving, saying: [...] "I didn't think it was the right decision. I felt like some of the problems could be worked through. But by the time it came to fruition, I was [...] for him because he was ready to go." [...] On the topic of losing a US$14 million contract, Knight commented: [...] "From an outsider's perspective, I get the [...] 'He's just a spoiled actor, he doesn’t know <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> has it.'

500|$|On November 5, California Chrome {{entered the}} Breeders' Cup Classic {{as a strong}} {{favorite}} over Travers Stakes winner Arrogate. [...] Chrome led from the outset, tracked by Arrogate. [...] The two horses engaged in the homestretch and in the final yards, Arrogate surged ahead to defeat California Chrome by a neck at the finish. The two horses dominated {{the remainder of the}} field by over 10 lengths. [...] Critics of the race and Espinoza himself speculated that the loss was because Espinoza had failed to make his move and establish a large enough lead earlier in the race. [...] Sherman also wondered if Espinoza could have opened up a bigger lead, but he was unsure if it would have mattered: [...] "That winner is the real McCoy, I knew he was the one we had to beat, but I didn't know <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> was," [...] he said. While the horse came out of the race in good shape, the press asked Raul Rodriquez if the horse [...] "knew" [...] that he had lost the race, and the groom replied, [...] "oh yeah." [...] Post race analysis gave California Chrome a Beyer Speed Figure of 119, the highest of his career, topped by 120 for Arrogate.|$|E

500|$|Five and a {{half months}} after his last start, American Pharoah began his second season in the Grade II Rebel Stakes on a sloppy track at Oaklawn Park on March 14. He carried top weight of 119 pounds and started as the 2–5 {{favorite}} against six opponents, headed by the Todd Pletcher-trained Madefromlucky. The colt led from the start and drew away in the closing stages to win by six and a quarter lengths. Espinoza called the winner [...] "an amazing horse", while Baffert was satisfied with the run, especially as the colt returned with a twisted shoe which would have hampered his progress. Four weeks later at the same track, American Pharoah started as the odds-on favorite against seven opponents in the Grade I Arkansas Derby. After racing in second place behind outsider Bridget's Big Luvy, he took the lead {{a quarter of a mile}} from the finish and steadily increased his advantage to win by eight lengths from Southwest Stakes winner Far Right. Baffert noted, [...] "He's matured substantially. He's a good horse and he keeps moving forward. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but Dortmund is another one who we don't yet know <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> is. We've got a one-two punch and that's a good position to be in." [...] After the race, Ron Moquett, the trainer of runner-up Far Right, described American Pharoah as [...] "a superhorse".|$|E

[...] Sky TV described Lucas North's character as a [...] "refreshing change" [...] for the series. The Bromsgrove Advertiser noted that Armitage [...] "certainly has the looks needed for the part" [...] with [...] "classic leading man presence," [...] and while comparing past main actors of the series, Matthew Macfadyen and Rupert Penry-Jones, the author believed that [...] "the eye candy quota is being kept high." [...] Leigh Holmwood of The Guardian reacted positively towards the introduction of Lucas after Adam's departure, believing the change has [...] "more than made amends." [...] David Blackwell of Enterline Media liked Lucas [...] "better than Adam Carter or Tom Quinn" [...] and felt that his [...] "dark and conflicted persona adds to the story and makes him a more interesting character than Adam or Tom ever were." [...] Blackwell also believed that Armitage's portrayal gives the character [...] "real intensity and mystery." [...] In the ninth series Metro's Lewis Bazley believed that Lucas [...] "continues to give a violent, powder-keg edge to proceedings – thank heaven for small mercies as his continual scowl never convinces in comparison with his predecessors Matthew McFadyen and Rupert Penry-Jones." ...|$|E

Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> sounded.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Love Me Like You" [...] {{was released on}} 10 October 2015.

Jade, Leigh-Anne, Jesy and Perrie are waiting for their dates to arrive. Scenes of the girls waiting for their date are intercut throughout the video of them sitting at a table while all of the other couples are dancing. Unbeknownst to them, the man, played by Hector David Junior, has invited each of them to go to the dance after meeting them in different situations prior to that night. He asked Jade by picking her up in his car to go on a date. As she gets in, he invites her to be his date at the dance and presents her with a corsage to wear on her wrist on the night. He mets Leigh-Anne at a high school basketball game, where she and her girlfriends were watching him and some other boys play on the court. He sees that she is infatuated by <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> is at the sport, walks up to her, and asks her to be his date by giving her a corsage. He asked Jesy to be his date while they were at the cinema as they shared a bucket of popcorn.

Recordings of some of these performances appeared on LP and others have appeared in recent years on the Jazz House and Harkit labels, recorded by the journalist Les Tomkins, but with non-professional sound quality. In this context he gained some high-profile admirers; Sonny Rollins asserted at one concert: [...] "Does anyone here know <b>how</b> <b>good</b> <b>he</b> is?".

Gosden, who was winning the race for the first time said [...] "It's great to win the Arc in France and the Derby in England - that's what it's about.
