5|$|Imperator Aleksandr III and {{the other}} ships of the {{division}} briefly followed Knyaz Suvorov until {{it became clear that}} the latter ship was out of control and then turned north in an effort to get behind Tōgō's ships. Knyaz Suvorov never regained her position in the battle line and became the primary target of the Japanese for a time. Around 16:00 the captain of Imperator Alexandr III, Nikolai Bukhvostov, decided to duplicate 's maneuver at the Battle of the Yellow Sea by charging straight for the Japanese battleline in an attempt to focus their attention on his ship rather than Knyaz Suvorov. He was successful, but Imperator Aleksandr III was badly damaged in the process. Borodino now assumed the lead position and turned the fleet to the south where they temporarily managed to disengage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mist</b> and fog.|$|E

25|$|Universal Studios {{bought the}} film rights to Gorillas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mist</b> from Fossey in 1985, and Warner Bros. Studios bought {{the rights to}} the Hayes article, despite its having been {{severely}} criticized by Rosamond Carr. As a result of a legal battle between the two studios, a co-production was arranged. Portions of the story and the Hayes article were adapted for the film Gorillas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mist,</b> starring Sigourney Weaver. The book covers Fossey's scientific career in great detail and omits material on her personal life, such as her affair with photographer Bob Campbell. In the film, the affair with Campbell (played by Bryan Brown) forms a major subplot. The Hayes article preceding the movie portrayed Fossey as a woman obsessed with gorillas, who would stop at nothing to protect them. The film includes scenes of Fossey's ruthless dealings with poachers, including a scene in which she sets fire to a poacher's home.|$|E

25|$|Mowat's Virunga, whose British and U.S. editions {{are called}} Woman in the Mists: The Story of Dian Fossey and the Mountain Gorillas of Africa, {{was the first}} book-length {{biography}} of Fossey, and it serves as an insightful counterweight to the many omissions in Fossey's own story, being derived from Fossey's actual letters and entries in her journals. Harold Hayes's book The Dark Romance of Dian Fossey was published in 1989 after extensive interviews with people who lived and worked with Fossey. Haye's book shows Fossey in a less positive or romanticized light than previous accounts had done. The film Gorillas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mist</b> was based on Hayes' 1987 article in Life magazine, as cited in the film's credits, instead of Fossey's self-edited autobiography by that title.|$|E

The mist lifted a little and many lines and waves of British troops were seen on the right flank advancing unopposed. A defensive flank was formed and fire opened on the British, causing many casualties, before a machine-gun began firing at them from behind on the left, forcing them under cover. A machine-gun began enfilade fire from the right, causing many casualties. An unarmed German officer appeared and {{announced that he was}} a prisoner and that the British were through the support and reserve positions and in Beaumont Hamel.

25|$|Former {{game warden}} turned film-maker, Simon Trevor, {{produced}} {{a number of}} award-winning films for Survival during a 30-year association with the series. Several of his films were shot in and around Kenya's Tsavo National Park, where he has his home, and featured the ongoing struggle faced by the park's animals, especially elephants, {{to survive in the}} face of natural and man-made threats. His film about the work of Daphne Sheldrick, widow of Tsavo's first warden, was the heart-warming story of her efforts to save orphaned elephants and other animals. Together They Stand was an intimate portrait of the African dwarf mongoose and was Survival’s first Golden Panda winner at the Wildscreen film festival. Trevor later highlighted renewed threats to the elephant population from poaching and culling in Elephants of Tsavo: Love and Betrayal, an account drawing on his film record of Tsavo’s wildlife shot over three decades. Hell or High Water showed what happened to animals and their habitats when Tanzania’s Great Ruaha River ran dry {{for the first time in}} living memory, and then torrential rains transformed the river into a torrent. Trevor, who also directed and filmed wildlife sequences for Hollywood movies including Out of Africa and Gorillas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mist,</b> subsequently set up the African Environmental Film Foundation to produce educational films for Africans on environmental issues.|$|E

Admiral Hipper rained fire on Glowworm, scoring several hits. Glowworm attempted to flee, but when it became apparent she could not {{break away from the}} pursuing cruiser, she turned toward Admiral Hipper and fired a spread of torpedoes, all of which missed.
