40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} {{potential}} threat for <b>virus</b> <b>spread</b> in {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs). Using epidemic theory, we proposed a new model, called Susceptible-Infective-Recovered with Maintenance (SIR-M), to characterize the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>spread</b> process from a single node to the entire network. By introducing a maintenance mechanism in the sleep mode of WSNs, the SIR-M model can improve the network’s anti-virus capability and enable the network to adapt flexibly to different types of viruses, without incurring additional computational or signaling overhead. The proposed model can capture both the spatial and temporal dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>spread</b> process. We derive explicit analytical solutions for the model and discuss some practical applications of interest. Extensive numerical results are presented to validate our analysis. The proposed model is applicable to the design and analysis of information propagation mechanisms in communication networks. I...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical {{modeling}} of computer virus/worm epidemic dynamics {{is an important}} problem that has attracted many studies. However, most existing models are adapted from biological epidemic ones. Although biological epidemic models can certainly be adapted to capture some computer <b>virus</b> <b>spreading</b> scenarios (especially when the so-called homogeneity assumption holds), the problem of computer <b>virus</b> <b>spreading</b> is not well understood because it has many important perspectives that are not necessarily accommodated in the biological epidemic models. In this paper we initiate the study of such a perspective, namely that of adaptive defense against epidemic spreading in arbitrary networks. More specifically, we investigate a non-homogeneous Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model where the model parameters may vary with respect to time. In particular, we focus on two scenarios we call semi-adaptive defense and fully-adaptive} defense, which accommodate implicit and explicit dependency relationships between the model parameters, respectively. In the semi-adaptive defense scenario, the model's input parameters are given; the defense is semi-adaptive because the adjustment is implicitly dependent upon <b>the</b> outcome of <b>virus</b> <b>spreading.</b> For this scenario, we present a set of sufficient conditions (some are more general or succinct than others) under which <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>spreading</b> will die out; such sufficient conditions are also known as epidemic thresholds in the literature. In the fully-adaptive defense scenario, some input parameters are not known (i. e., the aforementioned sufficient conditions are not applicable) but the defender can observe <b>the</b> outcome of <b>virus</b> <b>spreading.</b> For this scenario, we present adaptive control strategies under which <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>spreading</b> will die out or will be contained to a desired level.

40|$|Borna disease virus (BDV) is a nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus with a tropism for neurons. Infection with BDV causes {{neurological}} {{diseases in}} a wide variety of animal species. Although it is known that <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>spreads</b> from neuron to neuron, assembled viral particles have never been visualized in the brains of infected animals. This has led to the hypothesis that BDV spreads as nonenveloped ribonucleoproteins (RNP) rather than as enveloped viral particles. We assessed whether the viral envelope glycoprotein (GP) is required for neuronal dissemination of BDV by using primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons. We show that upon in vitro infection, BDV replicated and spread efficiently in this system. Despite rapid virus dissemination, very few infectious viral particles were detectable in the culture. However, neutralizing antibodies directed against BDV-GP inhibited BDV spread. In addition, interference with BDV-GP processing by inhibiting furin-mediated cleavage of <b>the</b> glycoprotein blocked <b>virus</b> <b>spread.</b> Finally, antisense treatment with peptide nucleic acids directed against BDV-GP mRNA inhibited BDV dissemination, marking BDV-GP as an attractive target for antiviral therapy against BDV. Together, our results demonstrate that the expression and correct processing of BDV-GP are necessary for BDV dissemination in primary cultures of rat hippocampal neurons, arguing against the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>virus</b> <b>spreads</b> from neuron to neuron in the form of nonenveloped RNP...|$|R
