25|$|A horse's teeth include incisors, premolars, molars, and {{sometimes}} canine teeth. A horse's incisors, premolars, and molars, once fully developed, continue to erupt throughout its lifetime as the <b>grinding</b> <b>surface</b> is worn down through chewing. Because of {{this pattern of}} wear, a rough estimate of a horse's age {{can be made from}} an examination of the teeth. Abnormal wear of the teeth, caused by conformational defects, abnormal behaviors, or improper diets, can cause serious health issues and can even result in the death of the horse.|$|E
25|$|Scientific {{instruments}} {{also experienced}} degradation {{as a result}} of exposure to the harsh Martian environment and use over a far longer period than had been anticipated by the mission planners. Over time, the diamond in the resin <b>grinding</b> <b>surface</b> of the Rock Abrasion Tool wore down, after that the device could only be used to brush targets. All of the other science instruments and engineering cameras continued to function until contact was lost; however, towards the end of Spirits life, the MIMOS II Mössbauer spectrometer took much longer to produce results than it did earlier in the mission because of the decay of its cobalt-57 gamma ray source that has a half life of 271 days.|$|E

2500|$|A horse's incisors, premolars, and molars, once fully developed, {{continue}} to erupt as the <b>grinding</b> <b>surface</b> is worn down through chewing.

The rest of the tooth will slowly emerge from the jaw, erupting about 1/8" [...] each year, as the horse ages. When the animal reaches old age, the crowns of the teeth are very short and the teeth are often lost altogether. Very old horses, if lacking molars, may need to have their fodder ground up and soaked in water to create a soft mush for them to eat in order to obtain adequate nutrition.|$|E

50|$|As {{the name}} implies, the rotary quern used {{circular}} motions to grind the material, meaning both the quern and the handstone were generally circular. The handstone of a rotary quern is much heavier {{than that of}} saddle quern and provides the necessary weight for the grinding of unmalted grain into flour. In some cases the <b>grinding</b> <b>surfaces</b> of the stones fit into each other, the upper stone being slightly concave and the lower one convex.|$|R
50|$|The term {{is derived}} from honing {{cylinders}} and holes. A flat workpiece surface is processed, hence the word flat; the word honing is used because the cutting speed is low compared to grinding. A fixed abrasive is used to provide accuracy and optical appearance of the surface finish. Sometimes it is also called fine <b>grinding</b> or <b>surface</b> <b>grinding</b> using planetary kinematics.|$|R

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{technological}} and economic considerations required to select face milling vs. <b>surface</b> <b>grinding</b> operations {{in the manufacture of}} hardened steel flat surfaces for dies and moulds. In terms of technological considerations, factors such as component geometry, material and surface quality (dimensional tolerance and surface finish) are taken into account. The economic considerations include the cost of machine depreciation, labour and consumables (cutting tools in face milling vs. grinding wheels and dressing tool in <b>surface</b> <b>grinding).</b> A case study is presented based on the prismatic components in ceramic tile moulds and their associated manufacturing operations. <b>Surface</b> <b>grinding</b> and face milling experimentation was conducted on cold work steel AISI D 3 (with hardness of 60 HRC) with aluminium oxide grinding wheels and coated tungsten carbide cutting tool, respectively. Technological attributes and economics of face milling are compared with <b>surface</b> <b>grinding</b> of this type of mould components.

40|$|Abstract. In recent years, {{there has}} been a great demand for large-diameter wafers with high {{flatness}} of hard and brittle materials that are used as optical and sensor elements. To meet these demands, we have developed an ultra-precision plane honing method as a highly efficient surface finishing technique using a fixed abrasive. This technique offers good finish surface roughness, shallow subsurface damage and high machining efficiency. However, {{there is a need to}} improve the surface flatness, which is dependent on the <b>grinding</b> wheel <b>surface</b> flatness and the tilt of the spindles. In this paper, the relationship between <b>grinding</b> wheel <b>surface</b> flatness and the shape of a truer is investigated by calculating the contact length of a point on the grinding wheel with the truer.

5000|$|Traditional East Asian ink is {{solidified}} into inksticks. Usually, {{some water}} is applied onto the inkstone (by {{means of a}} dropper to control the amount of water) before the bottom end of the inkstick {{is placed on the}} <b>grinding</b> <b>surface</b> and then gradually ground to produce the ink.

50|$|The most {{prominent}} feature {{that has created}} controversy in the assignment of Omphalosaurus is {{the placement of the}} teeth.

The tooth crowns of Omphalosaurus are lower and more irregular than other durophagus Ichthyosaurs, and the enamel typically has an orange-peel textured surface rather than Ichthyosaur’s typical longitudinal wrinkles. Omphalosaurus also have hollow ribs and humerus with prominent deltopectoral crest, neither of which are found in other Ichthyosaurs.|$|R
40|$|The chatter {{causes the}} poor surface finish during the <b>surface</b> <b>grinding.</b> It is {{therefore}} necessary {{to monitor the}} chatter during the process. Hence, this research has proposed the in-process chatter detection in the <b>surface</b> <b>grinding</b> process by utilizing the dynamic cutting forces. The ratios of the average variances of three dynamic cutting forces have been adopted and applied to identify the chatter during the <b>surface</b> <b>grinding</b> process to eliminate {{the effects of the}} cutting conditions. The effects of the cutting conditions on the chatter are also studied and analyzed. The algorithm has been proposed to detect the chatter regardless of the cutting conditions. The verification of the proposed system has been proved through another experiment by using the new cutting conditions. The experimental results have run satisfaction. It is understood that the chatter can be avoided during the in-process <b>surface</b> <b>grinding</b> even though the cutting conditions are changed...|$|R

The type of the original omnivorous teeth with short, [...] "bumpy" [...] molars, with which the prime members of the evolutionary line distinguished themselves, gradually changed into the teeth common to herbivorous mammals.

50|$|The <b>grinding</b> <b>surface</b> of a {{mulberry}} molar is also corrupted. Normally, the <b>grinding</b> <b>surface</b> of a molar has a pit and {{is surrounded}} by a circular ridge {{at the top of the}} tooth, which is used for grinding. The cusp deformity of the mulberry molar is characterized by an extremely shallow or completely absent pit. Instead, the pit area is filled with globular structures bunched together all along the top surface of the cusp. This type of deformity is also thought to be caused by enamel hypoplasia. Mulberry molars are typically functional and do not need treatment. If the deformity is severe or the person is bothered by the teeth, there are several options. The teeth can be covered with a permanent cast crown, stainless steel crown, or the molars can be removed and an implant or bridge can be put in place of the mulberry molar.|$|E
