Another problem concerns the <b>hydrogenate</b> attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines.

The piston shell must be lubricated and cooled with oil. This substantially increases the lubricating oil consumption in a four-stroke hydrogen engine.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{aromatic}} character, pyrrole {{is difficult}} to <b>hydrogenate,</b> does not easily react as a diene in Diels–Alder reactions, and does not undergo usual olefin reactions.

Under acidic conditions, pyrroles polymerize easily, and thus many electrophilic reagents that are used in benzene chemistry are not applicable to pyrroles. In contrast, substituted pyrroles (including protected pyrroles) have been used in a broad range of transformations.|$|E

25|$|For {{aromatic}} substrates, {{the first}} bond is hardest to <b>hydrogenate</b> {{because of the}} free energy penalty for breaking the aromatic system. The product {{of this is a}} cyclohexadiene, which is extremely active and cannot be isolated; in conditions reducing enough to break the aromatization, it is immediately reduced to a cyclohexene. The cyclohexene is ordinarily reduced immediately to a fully saturated cyclohexane, but special modifications to the catalysts (such as the use of the anti-solvent water on ruthenium) can preserve some of the cyclohexene, if that is a desired product.|$|E
2500|$|... α-Linolenic acid is {{relatively}} {{more susceptible to}} oxidation and will become rancid more quickly than many other oils. Oxidative instability of α-linolenic acid {{is one reason why}} producers choose to partially <b>hydrogenate</b> oils containing α-linolenic acid, such as soybean oil.

Thus, {{a carefully}} chosen catalyst {{can be used}} to <b>hydrogenate</b> some functional groups without affecting others, such as the hydrogenation of alkenes without touching aromatic rings, or the selective hydrogenation of alkynes to alkenes using Lindlar's catalyst. For example, when the catalyst palladium is placed on barium sulfate and then treated with quinoline, the resulting catalyst reduces alkynes only as far as alkenes. The Lindlar catalyst has been applied to the conversion of phenylacetylene to styrene.|$|E

Unlike the film thickness of <b>hydrogenated</b> non-doped DLC films, that of <b>hydrogenated</b> Ti-DLC films {{was found to}} be constant after the films were exposed to atomic oxygen. In addition, bulk composition of the <b>hydrogenated</b> Ti-DLC film stayed constant, and in particular, hydrogen content in the film did not decrease. These results indicate that a <b>hydrogenated</b> Ti-DLC film can keep its low friction properties under vacuum. Surface chemical analysis showed that a titanium-oxide layer is form on the film by exposure to atomic oxygen. The thickness of the titanium oxide layer was estimated to be about 5 nm from the element distribution in the depth direction of the <b>hydrogenated</b> Ti-DLC films.

40|$|Hydrogen {{generation}} via hydrolysis of 250 mg <b>hydrogenated</b> Mg(3) La and La(2) Mg(17) in 100 ml {{water has}} been investigated at 298 K. Hydrolysis reactions of <b>hydrogenated</b> Mg(3) La and La(2) Mg(17) obtained by induction melting and then <b>hydrogenated</b> at 298 K {{is found to be}} fast when they are immersed in water. The hydrolysis reaction of <b>hydrogenated</b> Mg(3) La almost completes within 21 min with faster kinetics and higher yield than those obtained of <b>hydrogenated</b> La(2) Mg(17). The hydrogen production rate is 43. 8 ml min(- 1) g(- 1) of hydrogen in the first 20 min of reaction compared to a conversion yield of 88 % for <b>hydrogenated</b> Mg(3) La and 40. 1 ml min(- 1) g(- 1) of hydrogen in the first 20 min of reaction for <b>hydrogenated</b> La 2 Mg 17. It is related to the catalytic effect of LaH(3) formed during the hydriding process, accentuating corrosion of MgH(2) greatly. The experimental curves of hydrogen generation kinetics at room temperature are well fitted by the Avrami-Erofeev equation.
