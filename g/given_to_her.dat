5|$|Along the way, Samus defeats {{four of the}} Space Pirate bosses, {{including}} Kraid and Ridley, and {{arrives in}} Tourian—the heart of the Space Pirate base. There, she encounters the Metroid larva, which has now grown to an enormous size. It attacks Samus and nearly drains all of her energy before it realizes who she is, and then departs. Samus recharges her energy and confronts Mother Brain, the biomechanical creature that controls the base's systems and all the enemy forces on Zebes. Mother Brain nearly kills Samus, but is then attacked by the Metroid larva, which drains it of its energy and transfers it back to Samus. Mother Brain recovers and destroys the Metroid in retaliation, but is in turn defeated by Samus with the Hyper Beam—an extremely powerful weapon created from the energy <b>given</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> by the Metroid. Afterward, a planetary self-destruct sequence begins, which Samus narrowly escapes.
