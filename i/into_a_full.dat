5|$|On {{the second}} anniversary of the train's famous dash, the {{original}} Zephyr was rechristened the Pioneer Zephyr to distinguish it as the first of the Burlington's growing Zephyr fleet. In 1938, car 525 was replaced by car number 500, a 40-seat buffet/lounge car, to provide light meals. Car number 505, the baggage-coach combine, was rebuilt at this time <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> baggage car, but it kept its original windows.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} day, June 28, Union and Confederate soldiers clashed again {{near the}} Golding house. Jones {{suspected that the}} Federals near the house were withdrawing, and authorized Toombs to perform a reconnaissance-in-force to ascertain whether this was true. However, Toombs turned the reconnaissance operation <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> engagement and advanced with some of Anderson's men. Before he could be countermanded, the Confederates had already been repulsed by the VI Corps.|$|E
5|$|While Smith {{tends to}} write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a {{collaborative}} effort. The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> 'Editors song'. Smith {{has said that he}} purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so people can draw their own conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Although some reviewers {{initially}} {{expressed concerns}} about the difficulty of expanding Portal <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed {{as one of the}} greatest video games of all time.|$|E

5|$|Around Wschodnia street, workers {{opened fire}} on a company of {{soldiers}} and cavalry, and on Południowa street, a unit of gendarmes was surrounded. Several fires begun in the town, as workers set liquor stores on fire, and the government forces assaulted the first barricades, initially without much success. The tsarist representatives called from reinforcements, which came from Częstochowa, Warsaw, and summer training camps. Several infantry regiments entered the city. Eventually, Russian forces sent to suppress the workers numbered six infantry regiments and several cavalry regiments. Despite that, the situation was spiralling <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> blown uprising. On 23 June, all industries, workshops, shops and offices were closed, as the workers and government forces clashed.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, the MBTA spent {{slightly}} less than $100,000 to rehabilitate the deteriorated garage and to convert the drop-off lane <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> busway with shelters, benches, and signage. The busway opened on September 9, 2003 and 21 MBTA Bus routes were rerouted from Central Square. In late 2005, the MBTA spent $168,000 for repairs to the garage roof, which frequently leaked during rain. The 1992 station was built with new concrete ties supporting the tracks connecting to the station, which proved less durable than expected. In September 2008, the MBTA board authorized a $1 million tie replacement and slope stabilization project at the station.|$|E
5|$|On 11th May, William and Mary {{formally}} {{accepted the}} Scottish throne and on 5th June, the Convention was converted <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> Parliament. William {{tried to avoid}} abolishing Episcopacy but Dundee's 1689 Highland campaign on behalf of James highlighted his reliance on Presbyterian support. He withdrew his opposition and the measures were approved by Parliament in 1690. The Glorious Revolution in Scotland resulted in a Parliament and Kirk far more independent than before but ending Episcopacy isolated {{a significant part of}} the political class. This was a major factor in political debates over the 1707 Act of Union and the Scottish Jacobite movement.|$|E

Ocarina of Time 3D was developed by Nintendo EAD in partnership with Grezzo, an independent Japanese studio headed by Koichi Ishii. The game was released in Japan on June 16, 2011; Europe on June 17, 2011; the United States on June 19, 2011; and Australia on June 30, 2011 (June 24, 2011, at some stores).|$|E
5|$|The Naqada culture {{manufactured}} {{a diverse}} selection of material goods, {{reflective of the}} increasing power and wealth of the elite, as well as societal personal-use items, which included combs, small statuary, painted pottery, high quality decorative stone vases, cosmetic palettes, and jewelry made of gold, lapis, and ivory. They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines. During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language.|$|E
5|$|UN forces {{responded to}} the threat with {{overwhelming}} numbers. A large force of South Korean troops, designated Task Force P'ohang, was massed and sent into P'ohang-dong to engage the 766th Regiment and the 5th Division. ROK troops attacked toward An'gang-ni to the east, forcing the KPA's 12th Division <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> retreat. Threatened with encirclement, the KPA's 5th Division and 766th Regiment were ordered into full retreat on August 17.

5|$|After an {{intersection}} with Shaver Road, US131 widens <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> freeway which passes the Gourdneck State Game Area as {{it enters the}} Kalamazoo metropolitan area. US131 meets I-94 southwest of Kalamazoo {{and picks up the}} Business Loop I-94 (BLI-94) designation for a couple of miles. This secondary designation leaves the freeway at exit36 and follows US131's business loop along Stadium Drive into downtown Kalamazoo near the main campus of Western Michigan University. As the freeway passes the west side of Kalamazoo the environs change to a more forested and semi-residential area. US131 passes the northern end of Bus. US131, a freeway spur accessible from the southbound lanes of US131. North of this partial interchange the freeway crosses into eastern Allegan County.|$|E
5|$|After the lackluster {{critical}} and commercial {{response to the}} first film, series creator Gene Roddenberry was {{forced out of the}} sequel's production. Executive producer Harve Bennett wrote the film's original outline, which Jack B. Sowards developed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> script. Director Nicholas Meyer completed its final script in 12 days, without accepting a writing credit. Meyer's approach evoked the swashbuckling atmosphere of the original series, and this theme was reinforced by James Horner's musical score. Leonard Nimoy had not intended to have a role in the sequel, but was enticed back on the promise that his character would be given a dramatic death scene. Negative test audience reaction to Spock's death led to significant revisions of the ending over Meyer's objections. The production team used various cost-cutting techniques to keep within budget, including utilizing miniature models from past projects and reusing sets, effects footage, and costumes from the first film. Among the film's technical achievements is being the first feature film to contain a sequence created entirely with computer-generated graphics.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur if the situation devolved <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E

5|$|Bushnell and Dabney {{began to}} design custom {{hardware}} {{to run the}} game's functions, and they soon discovered that the cost to build the whole game's computing systems would be much lower. As a result, they would not need to have multiple instances of the game running on the same machine {{in order to be}} profitable. On the other hand, however, the custom hardware was not as powerful as the more expensive Nova computer, which meant that the pair needed to make gameplay modifications. Spacewar was a two-player game featuring dogfights around the gravitational field of a central star; neither of these features could be run on the dedicated circuits the pair were making, so the game was cut down to a single-player game wherein the player would fight against two computer-controlled spaceships in open space. By January 1971, the pair had built some basic hardware which could connect to a monitor, with plans to continue expanding it to make a game now named Cosmic Combat, but they were still far away from turning what was then a dot moving on a screen <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> Spacewar-like game cabinet.|$|E
5|$|Clark {{began writing}} the song's lyrics on November 24, 1965, when he {{scribbled}} down some rough ideas for later development, following {{a discussion with}} guitarist Brian Jones, before the Byrds made a concert appearance supporting the Rolling Stones. Over the following days, Clark expanded this fragment <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> poem, eventually setting the words to music and giving them a melody. Clark then showed the song to McGuinn and Crosby, with the former suggesting that the song be arranged to incorporate Coltrane's influence. Since Clark's death, however, McGuinn has contended that {{it was he who}} conceived the initial idea of writing a song about an airplane ride and that he and Crosby both contributed lyrics to Clark's unfinished draft. In his book, Mr. Tambourine Man: The Life and Legacy of the Byrds' Gene Clark, author John Einarson disputes this claim and ponders whether McGuinn's story would be the same were Clark still alive.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{reassigned to}} 10./JG 1 {{based in the}} Ruhr, he shot down his first Viermot (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943.

Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed StaKa of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 he was promoted to Kommandeur of II/JG 11. Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>full</b> wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase the homeland protection.
