5|$|The {{provitamin}} A beta-carotene from carrots {{does not}} actually help {{people to see}} in the dark unless they suffer from a deficiency of vitamin A. This myth was propaganda used by the Royal Air Force during the Second World War to explain why their pilots had improved success during night air battles, but was actually used to disguise advances in radar technology and the use of red lights on <b>instrument</b> <b>panels.</b> Nevertheless, the consumption of carrots was advocated in Britain at the time as part of a Dig for Victory campaign. A radio programme called The Kitchen Front encouraged people to grow, store and use carrots in various novel ways, including making carrot jam and Woolton pie, named after the Lord Woolton, the Minister for Food. The British public during WWII generally believed that eating carrots would help them see better at night and in 1942 there was a 100,000 ton surplus of carrots from the extra production.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Franklin auto parts {{were built in}} the Franklin plant which designed and manufactured the complete engine including the carburetor, bearings, connecting rod forgings, valve springs and pistons. Franklin also manufactured transmissions, front and rear axles, steering gears, stampings, bodies and <b>instrument</b> <b>panels.</b>|$|E
25|$|High {{fidelity}} instrumentation such as <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> {{in virtual}} aircraft cockpits provides users with actual controls {{to raise the}} level of immersion. For example, pilots can use the actual global positioning system controls from the real device in a simulated cockpit to help them practice procedures with the actual device {{in the context of the}} integrated cockpit system.|$|E

30|$|Some {{functions}} {{have been}} included {{to be able to}} interact with or modify the driver environment through the <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> and the visual and acoustic stimuli. update_panel is used by the programmer to display symbols on the <b>instrument</b> <b>panel.</b> The programmer specifies the display where the symbols have to be displayed (GPS or the <b>instrument</b> <b>panel)</b> and a variable belonging to the Instrument_Panel type containing all the symbols to be used.|$|R
25|$|Further {{revisions}} include {{daytime running}} lights and OBD II compliant on-board diagnostic systems, tweaking the climate control and safety alarm, a revised keyless entry system with new features was and the short list of optional equipment was expanded to include chrome wheels and a gold trim package. The 1996-'99 models also had the passenger temperature toggle buttons on the middle right portion of the <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> replaced with air recirculator buttons.|$|E
25|$|The Beechcraft Model 65 Queen Air and Model 90 King Air {{are both}} direct descendents of the Model 50 Twin Bonanza. All three {{aircraft}} {{share the same}} basic wing design, as well as landing gear, flaps, <b>instrument</b> <b>panels,</b> fuel cells, and more. The Queen Air added a larger cabin to the design, while the later King Air added turbine power and pressurization. Twin Bonanza production ended in 1963 while the King Air was under development.|$|E
25|$|Interiors were revised with all-new <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> {{featuring}} a larger dose of walnut trim which now {{extended to the}} center console standard with bucket seats, along with a new steering wheel with horn bars replacing the horn ring used in previous years. The standard bucket seats could be upholstered either in expanded Morrokide vinyl or a new cloth-and-Morrokide trim. New for 1965 was a no-cost bench seat option with center armrest available with either upholstery choice.|$|E

25|$|LCDs {{are used}} {{in a wide range}} of {{applications}} including computer monitors, televisions, <b>instrument</b> <b>panels,</b> aircraft cockpit displays, and indoor and outdoor signage. Small LCD screens are common in portable consumer devices such as digital cameras, watches, calculators, and mobile telephones, including smartphones. LCD screens are also used on consumer electronics products such as DVD players, video game devices and clocks. LCD screens have replaced heavy, bulky cathode ray tube (CRT) displays in nearly all applications. LCD screens are available in a wider range of screen sizes than CRT and plasma displays, with LCD screens available in sizes ranging from tiny digital watches to huge, big-screen television sets.|$|E
500|$|Kellex's {{design for}} the main process {{building}} of K-25 called for a four-story U-shaped structure [...] long containing 51 main process buildings and 3 purge cascade buildings. These were divided into nine sections. Within these were cells of six stages. The cells could be operated independently, or consecutively, within a section. Similarly, the sections could be operated separately {{or as part of}} a single cascade. When completed, there were 2,892 stages. The basement housed the auxiliary equipment, such as the transformers, switch gears, and air conditioning systems. The ground floor contained the cells. The third level contained the piping. The fourth floor was the operating floor, which contained the control room, and the hundreds of <b>instrument</b> <b>panels.</b> From here, the operators monitored the process. The first section was ready for test runs on 17 April 1944, although the barriers were not yet ready to be installed.|$|E
500|$|After {{location}} {{shooting was}} completed, shooting {{on the new}} Engineering set began May 3. The set lasted {{less than a day}} in its pristine condition before it was [...] "Borgified". Filming then proceeded to the bridge. During normal operation scenes, Leonetti chose to cast crosslighting on the principals; this required the ceiling of the set to be removed and lighting grids to be situated around the sides. These lights were then directed towards the actors' faces at 90-degree angles. The set was lined with window paneling backed by red lights, which would blink intermittently during red-alert status. These lights were supplemented by what Leonetti called [...] "interactive light"; these were off-stage, red-gelled lights that cast flashing rims on the bridge set and heads of the crew. For the Borg intrusion, the lighting originated solely from <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> and red-alert displays. The fill light on these scenes was reduced so that the cast would pass through dark spots on the bridge and interiors out of the limited range of these sources. Small 30- and 50-watt lights were used to throw localized shafts of light onto the sets.|$|E

2500|$|Inside were revised <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> {{retaining}} the [...] "Mirrormatic" [...] speedometer and new upholstery trims. The Station Wagons received an all-vinyl interior as standard, with the regular cloth/vinyl combination interior available as an option.|$|E
2500|$|Other {{miscellaneous}} {{items include}} durable, lightweight luggage, MP3/digital audio player cases, ocarinas, computer cases, fountain pens, riot shields, <b>instrument</b> <b>panels,</b> tealight candle containers and blender jars. [...] Many toys and hobby items {{are made from}} polycarbonate parts, like fins, gyro mounts, and flybar locks in radio-controlled helicopters, and transparent LEGO (ABS is used for opaque pieces).|$|E
50|$|For 2006, {{another major}} change was made as the <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> on all Panther-platform cars was redesigned; the {{optional}} digital <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> was discontinued, {{as was the}} use of an analog odometer. While the oil pressure and voltage gauges were removed, a notable addition was a tachometer; the Grand Marquis was one of the very last Ford vehicles sold without one. Similar to other Ford vehicles, the new <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> features a Driver Information Center (trip computer), consolidating many functions previously seen in the overhead console in between the speedometer and tachometer.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} was similarly updated with an all-new design and <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> featuring the first blow molded symmetrical <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> retainer structure. This <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> featured a unique cluster/airbag bracket invented by Peter Gruich {{that allowed the}} interchange of the two components {{in order for the}} vehicle to be sold in the right hand and left hand drive markets with both driver and passenger airbags. A stiffer unibody frame brought improvements to noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) measurements. Also contributing to NVH improvements were new door seals that reduced wind noise at higher speeds.|$|R

Instruments {{moved in}} front of the right seat, where the student sits, which places the stick in the student's right hand and {{throttle}} in the left, in a similar arrangement to fighter aircraft. Also equipped with a smaller fuel tank. Some Embry-Riddle Falcons have been sold to private owners and flight schools after being fitted with standard <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> and fuel tanks.|$|E
2500|$|Very popular {{accessories}} were vinyl roofs, rally wheels, sport steering wheels, bucket {{seats with}} high backs, and tufted leatherette upholstery (many sedans were produced this way). Interiors were usually black. Steering wheels and <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> were only black for many years, as were seatbelts. American style interior color coordination was absent. The {{last year of}} the Nova in Argentina is called locally [...] "Opus 78" [...] (because the slogan of the publicity) and it was the most equipped, adding simil-leather bucket seats, air-conditioning, power steering, electric antenna, and a new dashboard with integrated central console.|$|E
2500|$|For automobiles, {{ultrasonic}} welding {{tends to be}} used to assemble large plastic and electrical components such as <b>instrument</b> <b>panels,</b> door panels, lamps, air ducts, steering wheels, upholstery and engine components. As plastics have continued to replace other materials in the design and manufacture of automobiles, the assembly and joining of plastic components has increasingly become a critical issue. [...] Some of the advantages for {{ultrasonic welding}} are low cycle times, automation, low capital costs, and flexibility. Also, ultrasonic welding does not damage surface finish, which is a crucial consideration for many car manufacturers, because the high-frequency vibrations prevent marks from being generated.|$|E

5000|$|As well as engine cradles, {{the main}} {{automotive}} applications for hydroforming are suspension, radiator supports and instrument-panel support beams. The 1994 Buick Regal and Oldsmobile Cutlass had hydro-formed <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> beams. [...] The first mass-produced automotive component was in 1990 with the <b>instrument</b> <b>panel</b> support beam for the Chrysler minivan.|$|R

2500|$|SR22s and SR20s {{built before}} 2003 were {{equipped}} with traditional analog instruments and a 10" [...] Multi-function display (MFD). In February 2003, Cirrus began offering SR22s with the Avidyne Entegra primary flight display (PFD), making the plane {{the first of}} its kind to come with a glass cockpit. Later that year, this instrumentation became standard equipment on all SR-series aircraft and helped pioneer the use of glass cockpits in the light general aviation industry. Retrofits are available for the older aircraft that replace the <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> with one that includes the PFD, a new MFD and the installation of back-up mechanical instruments.|$|E
2500|$|Models were molded in {{different}} colors, but often painted with actual factory paints, {{a practice that}} {{went back to the}} 1930s. Also, as with the 1964 Pontiac Grand Prix, the roof was cast in [...] "vinyl" [...] black. Script and emblem details were intricately molded into plastic bodies, grilles and wheels. Hoods did not open, there was no engine detail and no interiors on most models in the 1950s. Thus promos without interior or engine detail were called “coaster models” as opposed to kits with more detail. With the development of kits, however, viewing the interior became practical and as important as exterior appearance. Speedometer numbers could be read on the <b>instrument</b> <b>panels.</b> Horn rings on the steering wheels were accurately depicted brand by brand.|$|E
2500|$|Around 1917, Daniel McFarlan Moore, {{then working}} at the General Electric Company, {{developed}} the miniature neon lamp. The glow lamp has a very different design than the much larger neon tubes used for signage; the difference was sufficient that a separate US patent was issued for the lamp in 1919. A Smithsonian Institution website notes, [...] "These small, low power devices use a physical principle called [...] "coronal discharge." [...] Moore mounted two electrodes close together in a bulb and added neon or argon gas. The electrodes would glow brightly in red or blue, depending on the gas, and the lamps lasted for years. Since the electrodes could take almost any shape imaginable, a popular application has been fanciful decorative lamps. Glow lamps found practical use as electronic components, and as indicators in <b>instrument</b> <b>panels</b> and in many home appliances until the acceptance of Light-Emitting Diodes (LEDs) starting in the 1970s." ...|$|E
