5|$|Despite forming {{fairly close}} to the Lesser Antilles, no {{tropical}} cyclone warnings were issued for the islands, as the official forecast correctly foresaw that Philippe would stay well to the east. A tropical storm warning was issued for Bermuda on September 23, but proved redundant when Philippe dissipated well {{to the south of}} the island. The storm still brought gusty winds and moisture to the island, with 0.15inches (3.8mm) of precipitation reported on September 23. The circulation that absorbed Philippe dropped light rainfall on the island, and was responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> barometric pressure during the month.|$|E
5|$|Finally, the {{flared end}} {{is known as}} the bell. Contrary to popular belief, the bell does not amplify the sound; rather, it {{improves}} the uniformity of the instrument's tone <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> notes in each register. For the other notes the sound is produced almost entirely at the tone holes and the bell is irrelevant. On basset horns and larger clarinets, the bell curves up and forward and is usually made of metal.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech blocked {{all three}} Cincinnati extra point attempts, while Virginia Tech's sole extra point kick missed. Cincinnati's kicking woes were also {{reflected}} in their punting game. Cincinnati averaged just 19 yards a punt, setting the record <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> punting average in Sun Bowl history. All 24 of the game's points were scored in the second half. Virginia Tech earned just 34 rushing yards against the Bearcats' defense while allowing 369 yards to Cincinnati's rushing offense. Those two totals are the least-gained and most-allowed marks in Virginia Tech bowl game history.|$|E
5|$|An {{approaching}} trough {{over the}} central United States induced high wind shear over Sandy as it traversed the Bahamas, causing the hurricane to weaken to {{a tropical storm}} while turning more northeastward. The {{southern part of the}} trough detached, causing the shear to decrease late on October28 and allowing Sandy to regain strength. It attained a secondary peak of Category2 strength the following day, and later turned toward the west. During this change in direction, Sandy began to transition into an extratropical cyclone, a process it completed before making landfall near Brigantine, New Jersey, late on October29. The extratropical remnants weakened gradually overland, and the center of circulation was declared indistinguishable over western Pennsylvania two days later. In addition to becoming the largest Atlantic hurricane, Sandy broke records <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> pressures ever observed in many cities across the Northeastern United States.|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune the welfare state, by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E

5|$|On 26 March 2012, the Public Service Division of the Prime Minister's Office {{announced}} that the fixed component of the salary of a political appointment holder would be 13 months {{of his or her}} monthly salary. For 2011, the annual variable component of the salary would be 1.25 months plus $250, while the national bonus would be 2.625 months though appointment holders would receive a pro rata amount of 1.618 months' pay as the new salaries took effect from 21 May 2011 when the Cabinet was appointed following the general election. The targets for the four indicators making up the national bonus were 2–3% for real median income growth of citizens and real median income growth <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> 20th percentile of citizens, 3–5% for real GDP growth, and not more than 4.5% for the unemployment rate of citizens. Each appointment holder's performance bonus would be determined by the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the album began on May 1, 1979 at Gold Star Studios in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Gold Star Studios had become famous through its history with artists like Eddie Cochran and the Beach Boys. At the Ramones' request, Ed Stasium {{helped with the}} album's engineering. During the studio work, Spector's recording methods were different from those the Ramones were accustomed to from their four previous studio albums. The band recorded their earlier compositions in the shortest time possible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> feasible budget, with a relatively low production value. With End of the Century, the band experienced Spector's infamous perfectionism, and a budget of $200,000 to fully record and produce the album. This is significant because the band's debut album cost $6,400 total, and their second album cost $10,000. End of the Century {{is the most expensive}} album in the Ramones' career.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{contributed to}} {{exceptional}} activity. A strong El Niño observed in 2009 rapidly transitioned into a strong La Niña by mid-summer 2010, projecting anomalously low vertical wind shear across the Atlantic Ocean. Ocean temperatures reached record levels across the basin, averaging at 0.82°C above the 1981–2010 average. Not only did ocean temperatures surpass 2005 {{to break the}} record overall, averaged water temperatures across the Main Development Region (MDR) of the Atlantic set monthly records from February to October 2010. This was aided by a strongly negative North Atlantic Oscillation that contributed to weaker trade winds and thus anomalous warming of ocean temperatures {{in the months leading}} up to the hurricane season. Lower sea level pressures were prevalent throughout much of the season, trailing only 1955 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> average values across the MDR during the August to October period. In spite of the high number of tropical cyclones, mid-level dry air dominated the tropical Atlantic throughout the peak of the season, perhaps hindering the season from being even more active.|$|E

5|$|There {{have been}} 40head coaches for the Cardinals {{franchise}} since {{it became a}} professional team in 1920; fourteen of the team's coaches are former Cardinals players. Ernie Nevers and Jimmy Conzelman are the only coaches to have {{had more than one}} tenure with the team. Pop Ivy and Gene Stallings both coached the team during its move from one city to another. Cardinals coach Roy Andrews is tied <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> winning percentage among the team's coaches (.000), having lost the only game he coached, in 1931. Co-coach Walt Kiesling lost all 10 games he coached in 1943, when the team merged with the Steelers during World War II and was known as Card-Pitt. Co-coaches Ray Willsey, Ray Prochaska, and Chuck Drulis have the highest winning percentage among Cardinals coaches (1.000). The team's all-time leader in games coached is Ken Whisenhunt, who was hired on January 14, 2007, with 96. The all-time leader in wins is Whisenhunt with 45. Whisenhunt was fired on December 31, 2012, after the Cardinals recorded a 5–11 record in 2012.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{taxation}} {{is generally}} progressive, especially the federal income taxes, and {{is among the}} most progressive in the developed world. The highest 10% of income earners pay a majority of federal taxes, and about half of all taxes. Payroll taxes for Social Security are a flat regressive tax, with no tax charged on income above $118,500 (for 2015 and 2016) and no tax at all paid on unearned income from things such as stocks and capital gains. The historic reasoning for the regressive nature of the payroll tax is that entitlement programs have not been viewed as welfare transfers. However, according to the Congressional Budget Office the net effect of Social Security is that the benefit to tax ratio ranges from roughly 70% for the top earnings quintile to about 170% <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> earning quintile, making the system progressive.|$|E
5|$|In March 1915, Ruth {{reported}} to Hot Springs, Arkansas {{for his first}} major league spring training. Despite a relatively successful first season, he was not slated to start regularly for the Red Sox, who already had two stellar left-handed pitchers: the established stars Dutch Leonard, who had broken the record <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lowest</b> earned run average (ERA) in a single season; and Ray Collins, a 20-game winner in both 1913 and 1914. Ruth was ineffective in his first start, taking the loss in the third game of the season. Injuries and ineffective pitching by other Boston pitchers gave Ruth another chance, and after some good relief appearances, Carrigan allowed Ruth another start, and he won a rain-shortened seven inning game. Ten days later, the manager had him start against the New York Yankees at the Polo Grounds. Ruth took a 3–2 lead into the ninth, but lost the game 4–3 in 13 innings. Ruth, hitting ninth as was customary for pitchers, hit a massive home run into the upper deck in right field off of Jack Warhop. At the time, home runs were rare in baseball, and Ruth's majestic shot awed the crowd. The winning pitcher, Warhop, would in August 1915 conclude a major league career of eight seasons, undistinguished but for being the first major league pitcher {{to give up a}} home run to Babe Ruth.|$|E

30|$|Third, the {{exclusion}} restriction in Condition 1 {{requires that the}} instrument is not correlated {{with any of the}} omitted factors in Eq. (1). This implies assuming that the scars of graduating in downturns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> educated are determined exclusively by early non-employment. This assumption is consistent with the results of Cockx and Ghirelli (2015), who find that, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> educated, <b>the</b> unemployment rate at graduation entails a persistent negative effect on hours worked and earnings but not on wages. This means that <b>the</b> <b>low</b> educated who graduate in downturns experience longer periods of non-employment {{at the start of the}} career, and this has repercussions in the long-term. The absence of a negative impact on wages is due to the presence of high minimum wages, which are likely to be binding for low educated youth. This suggests that, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> educated, accepting lower-paying jobs is not a relevant channel to explain the scarring effects of graduating in downturns. Thus, based on the aforementioned evidence, we argue that early non-employment is the relevant channel to explain such a scar <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>low</b> educated.|$|R
