40|$|A {{method for}} calculating the total {{electronic}} energy {{as a function}} of the atomic displacements within the tight-binding approximation is presented. The sum of one electron energies is formally expanded to second order with the help of the perfect crystal Green's functions. The remaining contribution is expressed as a sum of repulsive pair potentials. A simple application to the molecular or bond orbital model of covalent semiconductors is described which already leads to fairly realistic phonon dispersion curves. The simplicity of the method thus makes it particularly suitable for the study of atomic rearrangements near defects or surfaces. It also allows its extension to much more complicated cases, such as amorphous systems, <b>defect</b> <b>tetrahedral</b> compounds and even transition metal oxides...|$|R

The internal friction of the Na 0. 5 Bi 0. 5 TiO 3 ceramic at low frequency (0. 5 ∼ 4 Hz) was measured in the temperature range from room temperature to 900 K. Three prominent internal friction peaks were observed. The P 1 peak is composed of three internal friction peaks. The lower temperature peaks (P 1 L 1 and (P 1 L 2) {{may be caused by}} the stress-induced motion of domain walls pinned by the oxygen vacancies and the oxygen ion diffusion in Na 0. 5 Bi 0. 5 TiO 3 sample, respectively. The higher temperature peak (P 1 H) may be related with the phase transition between the ferroelectric and anti-ferroelectric phase. The broader P 2 peak shows that the phase transition between rhombohedral and tetragonal phase is a gradually changing process. The asymmetry of the P 3 peak includes the two subpeaks (P 3 L and P 3 H peak).

40|$|The phase {{evolution}} of zirconia (ZrO 2), sulfated zirconia (SO 42 -/ZrO 2) and yttrium oxide incorporated zirconia (Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2) from the <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>phase</b> to the monoclinic phase was studied using UV Raman spectroscopy, visible Raman spectroscopy and x-ray diffraction (XRD). It is clearly observed {{that there are}} discrepancies between {{the results from the}} UV Raman spectra, visible Raman spectra and XRD patterns. The phase change from tetragonal to monoclinic is always earlier or at lower calcination temperatures as observed by UV Raman spectroscopy than by visible Raman spectroscopy and XRD. UV Raman spectroscopy is found to be more sensitive at the surface region while visible Raman spectroscopy and XRD supply the information mainly from the bulk. The inconsistency in the results from the three techniques suggests that the phase transformation of zirconia starts from its surface region and then gradually develops into its bulk. For SO 42 -/ZrO 2 and Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2, the transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase is significantly retarded owing to the presence of the sulfated groups and the yttrium oxide. Particularly, the tetragonal phase of Y 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 can be maintained up to 800 degreesC although its phase at the surface region changed into monoclinic at 500 degreesC.

In this context, Europe in its 'Raw materials' strategy puts the recycling at the center of its concerns to provide a part of securing its supplies in rare earth elements. Recycling of these substances, on an industrial scale, remains somewhat developed while it presents numerous advantages over the exploitation of primary resources. This paper will present some results obtained from characterization study of permanent magnets present in wastes of electric and electronic equipment. Three different electronic components containing magnets are identified: hard dick drives, small electric motors and speakers. Several kilograms of theses wastes have been sampled at recycling plant. The representative sample has been dismantled manually to recover the magnets contained to quantify the amount of magnets in the investigated components. Thorough characterization results show that the weight percentage of magnets varies in the three investigated electronic components: 4 6 % in the speakers, 2. 5 - 2. 8 % in the hard disks, and between 0. 8 and 2 % in some electric motors.

For covalent amorphous semiconductors and glasses, such an idealized structural model, the continuous-random network, was introduced 70 years ago by Zachariasen. In this model, each atom is placed in a crystal-like local environment, with perfect coordination and chemical ordering, yet longer-range order is nonexistent. Defects, such as missing or added bonds, or chemical mismatches, however, are not accounted for.

The phase diagram of these models confirms the singularity-free scenario previously proposed by Sastry and co-workers (Sastry et al, PRE 53, 6144 (1996)).

40|$|Access {{restricted}} to the OSU CommunityPolycrystalline CuInSe₂ (CIS) and related materials, are promising candidates of low-cost high efficiency solar cells. This thesis describes the applications of phase diagrams to suggest alternative absorber precursor structures, explores the use of Rapid Thermal Processing (RTP), and elucidates the structure of CuInSe₂ and related materials. A critical assessment of the thermochemical and phase diagram data for the Se unary, Cu-Se, and In-Se binary systems was performed. This information was used to give an evaluated Cu₂Se-In₂Se₃ pseudobinary phase diagram and suggest liquidus lines in the Cu-In-Se ternary system. The resulting information was used to propose a novel bi-layer precursor structure consisting of a co-deposited In-Se (50 to 55 Se at. %) top layer and a Cu-Se (50 to 55 Se. at. %) bottom layer. This precursor structure was designed to form CIS by reacting a liquid CuSe with a solid InSe phase in the process temperature window 524 °C to 611 °C. Two different precursor structures were fabricated and tested. The first one consists of the three layers, In₄Se₃/CuInSe₂/Cu₂Se, and the second one was a simple two-layer structure, InSe/CuSe. After RTP, the first precursor structure underwent a liquid-solid reaction and formed large grained CuInSe₂ films. It is believed the melting of top In₄Se₃ layer occurs through a monotetic reaction. The second precursor structure also lead {{to the formation of}} large grained CIS(~ 5 [micro]m) films, as suggested in the reaction pathway analysis. X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (XAFS) measurements were performed on crystals of CuInSe₂ with different compositions close to the 1 : 1 : 2 stoichiometry, and CuIn₃Se₅. It was found that the Cu-Se bond length is independent o f the Cu occupation number in this composition range within a length of 0. 01 Å. Least-square fitting of the Se-K edge EXAFS spectra indicated CuInSe₂ consists of Se-centered tetrahedron with an average of 2 Cu and 2 In nearest neighbors. On the other hand, CuIn₃Se₅ consists of Se-centered tetrahedron with an average of 0. 8 Cu and 2. 4 In nearest neighbors. The Cu-Se and In-Se bond lengths were determined to be 2. 424 and 2. 598 Å, respectively.

40|$|Water and silicon are {{chemically}} dissimilar substances {{with common}} physical properties. Their liquids display {{a temperature of}} maximum density, increased diffusivity on compression, they form tetrahedral crystals and <b>tetrahedral</b> amorphous <b>phases.</b> The common feature to water, silicon and carbon is the formation of tetrahedrally coordinated units. We exploit these similarities to develop a coarse-grained model of water (mW) that is essentially an atom with tetrahedrality intermediate between carbon and silicon. mW mimics the hydrogen-bonded structure of water through {{the introduction of a}} nonbond angular dependent term that encourages tetrahedral configurations. The model departs from the prevailing paradigm in water modeling: the use of long-ranged forces (electrostatics) to produce short-ranged (hydrogen-bonded) structure. mW has only short-range interactions yet it reproduces the energetics, density and structure of liquid water, its anomalies and phase transitions with comparable or better accuracy than the most popular atomistic models of water, at less than 1 % of the computational cost. We conclude {{that it is not the}} nature of the interactions but the connectivity of the molecules that determines the structural and thermodynamic behavior of water. The speedup in computing time provided by mW makes it particularly useful for the study of slow processes in deeply supercooled water, the mechanism of ice nucleation, wetting-drying transitions, and as a realistic water model for coarse-grained simulations of biomolecules and complex materials.

The {{results from this}} analysis suggest that the individual units in a <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>defect</b> cluster are connected along vectors into a Koch-Cohen-like arrangement, {{with the majority of}} octahedral vacancies concentrated near these defects. Bond valence calculations indicate a change in the charge distribution on the cations with the charge on the tetrahedral interstitials increasing on cooling. The magnetic structure is more complex than previously thought, corresponding to a non-collinear spin arrangement described by a superposition of a condensed spin wave on the established type-II antiferromagnetic ordering. This leads to an architecture with four groups of cations each with different spin directions. The cations within the interstitial clusters appear to be weakly ferromagnetically coupled and their spins are correlated to the spins of the octahedral cations closest to them.

40|$|Nematic Liquid {{crystals}} (NLC) are rod like {{molecules that}} {{in the absence of}} external influences arrange themselves parallel to each other and hence tend to point in a given direction. The average orientation of these molecules is given by the director n, which is essentially a bi-directional vector which quantifies the orientation of the molecules in a given region of the sample. When NLCs are confined to a curved surface, the geometrical constraints imposed by the surface causes a distortion in the molecular orientation. In certain regions, the molecular orientation is such that the director cannot be defined. Such regions are called topological defects. Theory had predicted that the ground state of NLCs confined to a spherical surface has four defects located at the vertices of a tetrahedron. The <b>tetrahedral</b> <b>defect</b> structure is of great interest in material science because defects in NLCs are regions that can be functionalized to serve as bonds that could pave the way for making macroatoms with tetrahedral bonding properties similar to sp 3 hybridized atoms like Carbon.

Because of the preference direction of the defect, the results are more lengthy than those for isotropic defects, being reported in [10]. Therefore we restrict ourselves to a perturbation theory of first order in the elastic anisotropy of the lattice. Consequentlythe results will be of quantitative use only for weakly anisotropic materials such as Al, Pt or NaCl. For the more anisotropic crystals, such as Nb or Cu, we should expect only quantitative information. For the derivation of some basic formulas and integral solutions we ref er to the JÜL-Report [10]...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResults are {{presented}} of new geological observations and laboratory analyses on Libyan Desert Glass (LDG), a unique {{kind of impact}} glass found in Egypt, probably 28. 5 - 29. 4 million years in age. A new LDG occurrence has been discovered some 50 kilometers southward of the main LDG occurrences in the Great Sand Sea. From Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) analysis, the molecular structure of LDG is refined and significant differences are shown between LDG specimens and other pure silica glasses (fulgurite, industrial fused quartz and amorphous biogenic silica) {{that are related to}} differences in their structures. The slight variations observed here for the mean Si-O-Si angle between the different glasses are attributed to their thermal histories. With regard to the other glasses analyzed, the LDG infrared spectral parameters point to a higher ratio of discontinuities and <b>defects</b> in the <b>tetrahedral</b> [SiO 4] network. The quantitative mineralogical constitutions of sandstones and quartzites from the LDG geological setting were analyzed by FTIR. Cretaceous sandstones have a specific composition (about 90 wt % quartz, 10 % dickite), clearly different from the Palaeozoic ones (about 90 wt % quartz, but ≥ 7 % kaolinite). It is shown that the reddish silts bearing the LDG are constituted mainly by microquartz enriched with dickite, whose particle size distribution is characteristic of fluvio-lacustrine deposits, probably Oligocene to Miocene in age. The target rocks, most probably quartz sand, resulted from the weathering (loss of the cementing microquartz) of the Cretaceous sandstones from the Gilf Khebir Plateau with deposition in a high energy environmen...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{liquid-liquid}} {{phase transition}} {{has been proposed}} and investigated {{in a wide variety}} of pure substances recently, including water, silica and silicon. From computer simulations using the Stillinger-Weber classical empirical potential, Sastry and Angell [1] demonstrated a first order liquid-liquid transition in supercooled silicon, subsequently supported by experimental and simulation studies. Here, we report evidence for a liquid-liquid critical end point at negative pressures, from computer simulations using the SW potential. Compressibilities exhibit a growing maximum upon lowering temperature below 1500 K and isotherms exhibit density discontinuities below 1120 K, at negative pressure. Below 1120 K, isotherms obtained from constant volume-temperature simulations exhibit non-monotonic, van der Waals-like behavior signaling a first order transition. We identify Tc ~ 1120 +/- 12 K, Pc - 0. 60 +/- 0. 15 GPa as the critical temperature and pressure for the liquid-liquid critical point. The structure of the liquid changes dramatically upon decreasing the temperature and pressure. Diffusivities vary over 4 orders of magnitude, and exhibit anomalous pressure dependence near the critical point. A strong relationship between local geometry quantified by the coordination number, and diffusivity, is seen, suggesting that atomic mobility in both low and high density liquids can usefully be analyzed in terms of <b>defects</b> in the <b>tetrahedral</b> network structure. We have constructed the phase diagram of supercooled silicon. We identify the lines of compressibility, density extrema (maxima and minima) and the spinodal which reveal the interconnection between thermodynamic anomalies and the phase behaviour of the system as suggested in previous works [2 - 9]Comment: (to be published in revised form); small corrections to previous version; Nature Physics 201...|$|R

The D band is assigned to the A 1 g mode and is absent in perfectly stacked graphite but is induced by structural defects in CM (Tuinstra and Koenig 1970; Bény-Bassez and Rouzaud 1985). Poorly organized CM contains additional bands at about 1200  cm− 1 (known as the D 4 band), 1500  cm− 1 (D 3 band), and 1620  cm− 1 (D 2 band) (Beyssac et al. 2002, 2003; Sadezky et al. 2005; Guedes et al. 2010; Lahfid et al. 2010). The D 4 band is attributed to either the sp 2 –sp 3 bond or to C–C and C=C stretching vibrations in polyene-like structures (Dippel et al. 1999). The D 3 band is attributed to out-of-plane <b>defects,</b> such as <b>tetrahedral</b> carbons; such <b>defects</b> are most likely released during the early stages of graphitization (Bény-Bassez and Rouzaud 1985). The D 2 band forms a shoulder on the G band, but its significance is poorly understood. In very poorly organized CM, which was the case for all of our samples, the G and D 2 bands cannot be resolved, so a single broad band occurs at around 1600  cm− 1 (Beyssac et al. 2003). Although some studies have adopted a complicated waveform separation of four sub-peaks at around 1350 – 1700  cm− 1 (e.g., Beyssac et al. 2002), the attribution of the sub-peaks at molecular level is not based on a complete understanding of the physicochemistry of CM. Therefore, we used only the D and G bands for our spectroscopic analysis.|$|R
40|$|Infra-red {{photoluminescence}} (PL) {{spectra of}} zinc and copper related defects in silicon {{are presented in}} this thesis. Seven new PL systems with principal zero phonon lines at 919. 8, 943. 67, 945. 8, 1033. 5, 1059. 9, 1090. 7 and 1129. 8 meV are discussed. All of the spectra can be classified as being due to isoelectronic bound exciton (IBE) recombination. Although {{the identities of the}} binding centres have not been conclusively established clear evidence has been obtained in most cases for the involvement of at least one specific transition metal (TM) impurity element. The PL systems at 945. 8, 919. 8 and 1059. 9 meV are all observed in silicon diffused with zinc and another TM. The 945. 8 meV system is observed in silicon diffused with zinc at 1100 ° C for 16 hours. The system is not created by interstitial Mn and substitutional Zn as previously suggested. The 919 meV system is observed in silicon co-diffused with zinc and copper at 1100 ° C for 16 hours, while the 1059. 9 meV system is most clearly observed in SisFeZn quenched from 1000 ° C. For silicon implanted with zinc the 1129. 8 and 1090. 7 meV systems are observed. Both of these systems have ground state and excited state splittings placing them in a minority group of IBE centres in silicon associated with deep acceptors and including the indium and thallium systems. The quenching rate is found to be crucial for samples diffused with copper only. Slow quenches produce the 1034 meV SK system. Zeeman studies on the zero phonon lines of this centre reveal a singlet - triplet nature indicative of a strong central cell potential about the defect as well as a strong crystal field reaction. Rapid quenches combined with * low copper concentrations produces the 943. 7 Cu PL system. Uniaxial stress and magnetic field measurements on this centre suggest that the two lowest energy transitions arise from bound exciton recombination at a <b>defect</b> with <b>tetrahedral</b> or near tetrahedral symmetry. Diffusion rate calculations show that a single interstitial copper atom is not the most likely configuration. A larger defect involving one or more atoms in a Td arrangement is more likely, perhaps similar to to those already reported for the Mn 4 and Li^ defects in PL and for the NL 22 Fe related centre in EPR. It is concluded that diffusion is not a suitable method of introducing transition metal impurities into silicon since the process is extremely susceptible to contamination. Implantation of the desired element followed by rapid thermal annealing is suggested as a much more promising avenue of investigation since this method affords much more control over the concentration, implantation depth and most importantly of all, the identity of the chemical element introduced into the host crystal...|$|R

Our results reveal that the structural transition (TS ~ 55 K) has a weak effect on the electronic structure of iron ions, while at T < TN the spectra show a continuous distribution of hyperfine fields HFe. Shape of these spectra was analyzed in term of two models: (i) an incommensurate spin density wave modulation of iron magnetic structure, (ii) a formation of a microdomain structure or phase separation. It was shown that the hyperfine parameters obtained using these two methods have very similar values over the whole temperature range. The analysis of the temperature dependence HFe(T) with the Bean-Rodbell model leads to ksi = 1. 16 +/- 0. 05, suggesting that the magnetic phase transition is first-order in nature. A sharp evolution of the VZZ(T) and etha(T) parameters of the full Hamiltonian of hyperfine interactions near T ~ (TN, TS), were interpreted as a manifestation of the anisotropic electron redistribution between the dxz, dyz- and dxy-orbitals of the iron ions.
