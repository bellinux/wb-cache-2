25|$|By {{the age of}} 16, Shields {{had become}} one of the most {{recognizable}} faces in the United States, because of her dual career as a provocative fashion model and child actress. Time magazine reported in its February 9, 1981 cover story that her <b>day</b> <b>rate</b> as a model was $10,000. In 1983, Shields appeared on the cover of the September issue of Paris Vogue, the October and November issues of American Vogue and the December edition of Italian Vogue. During that period Shields became a regular at New York City's nightclub Studio 54. In 2009, a picture of a naked Brooke Shields taken when she was 10 and included in a work by Richard Prince, Spiritual America, created a row. It was removed from an exhibition at the Tate Modern after a warning from the police.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis {{is to improve the}} {{understanding}} of how offshore supply shipowners adapt to lower demand by putting ships in lay-up. We have examined how <b>day</b> <b>rates</b> affect lay-up levels, and sought to explain other factors than <b>day</b> <b>rates</b> that might impact the lay-up decision. We have also looked at how specific vessel characteristics impact the likelihood that a given vessel will be laid up. We have used both a qualitative and an empirical approach in our research. In the qualitative part, we have interviewed seven Norwegian offshore supply shipowners that operate Platform Supply Vessels (PSV) and/or Anchor Handling Tug Supply (AHTS) vessels in the North Sea. We have found that in addition to using lay-up to reduce costs, the shipowners see the opportunity to reduce supply as a main motivation for laying up vessels. They achieve this by coordinating lay-up levels and thus engage in tacit collusion. Furthermore, we have found that the attractiveness of lay-up depends on the market outlook, the opportunity to scrap or sell vessels, startup costs for new vessels, vessel deterioration when in lay-up, and the ability to keep employees and competence in the company. The qualitative part of our research enabled us to formulate some hypotheses that we tested empirically using fleet statistics and <b>day</b> <b>rates</b> from the North Sea region. Using OLS, we found that <b>day</b> <b>rates</b> are negatively correlated with lay-up levels, but {{that there might be a}} time lag in how a reduction in <b>day</b> <b>rates</b> leads to an increase in laid up vessels. Using logistic regression, we found that vessel age had some negative correlation with layup levels, though the correlation was not strong. High capacity as measured by clear deck area for PSVs had a significant, negative correlation with the likelihood of lay-up. Bollard pull had a significant, negative correlation with the likelihood of lay-up for AHTSs...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{institutions}} for long-run economic development is {{widely recognized as}} important. However, we have limited knowledge about how institutional quality systematically influence prices in a specific market. This thesis investigates {{the relationship between a}} country’s institutional quality and <b>day</b> <b>rates</b> in the global offshore supply vessel market. Two hypotheses constitutes the starting point for investigating this relationship. One, there are arguments suggesting a negative association between institutional quality and costs, i. e. higher costs in countries with low quality institutions due to higher operational risk. Two, {{at the same time there}} are arguments suggesting a positive effect, i. e. higher costs in countries with high institutional quality, because these countries in general are more expensive. Using proprietary offshore market data, I find that there is a positive correlation between a country’s institutional quality score and earned <b>day</b> <b>rates.</b> Furthermore, I investigate through what channels this correlation works. I find that institutions influence <b>day</b> <b>rates</b> through the positive correlation between institutions and economic development. Because of the presence of competition across countries, we would expect costs and prices to become equal across countries. However, it seems that prices of offshore services may be higher in richer countries due to the substantial presence of non-tradables. Lastly, I follow Acemoglu and Johnson (2005) in their unbundling {{of institutions}}. By using proxies for property rights institutions and contracting institutions, I find that institutional quality matter in the form of property rights institutions, and that the latter has no influence on <b>day</b> <b>rates.</b> The thesis also offers qualitative discussion of the results. nhhma...|$|R

Landis had been a crew member on Kelly's Heroes and had become friends with actor Donald Sutherland, sometimes babysitting his son Kiefer. Landis asked Sutherland, {{one of the biggest}} stars of the 1970s, to be in the film. For two days of work, Sutherland declined the initial offer of $20,000 plus [...] "points" [...] (a percentage of the gross or net income). Universal then offered him his <b>day</b> <b>rate</b> of $25,000 or 2% of the film's gross. Sutherland took the guaranteed fee, assuming that the film would not be very successful; although this made him the highest-paid member of the cast (Neidemeyer's horse, Junior, and John Belushi each received $40,000), the decision cost Sutherland what he estimates as $14 million. The star's participation, however, was crucial; Landis later said [...] "It was Donald Sutherland who essentially got the film made." ...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{possibility}} that head injury {{may influence the}} development of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been studied inconclusively in the past. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether head injury is {{associated with an increased}} risk of MS. METHOD: Analysis of database of linked hospital and death records, comparing the occurrence of MS in a cohort of people admitted to hospital with head injury and a reference cohort. RESULTS: The rate ratio for MS after head injury, compared with the reference cohort, was 1. 1 (95 % confidence interval, 0. 88 to 1. 36). There was no significant increase in the risk of MS at either short or long time periods after head injury. Using length of hospital stay as a proxy for severity of injury, there was no significant increase in the rate ratio for MS after head injuries with hospital stays of less than two <b>days</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio = 1. 1 (0. 71 to 1. 57)), two or more <b>days</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio = 1. 0 (0. 68 to 1. 45)), or seven or more <b>days</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio = 1. 3 (0. 64 to 2. 34)). CONCLUSIONS: The method used, record linkage, ensures that patients' recollection of injury, or any tendency to attribute MS to injury, cannot have influenced the results. Injuries to the head were not associated with either the aetiological initiation or the clinical precipitation of onset of multiple sclerosis...|$|R
