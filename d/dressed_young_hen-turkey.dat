60|$|The {{door-bell}} rang. He {{answered it}} a little impatiently. A slim, fashionably <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> Frenchman stood there, whose face was vaguely familiar to him.|$|R
60|$|A {{little farther}} on Dorothy met a most beautifully <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> Princess, who stopped short {{as she saw}} the strangers and started to run away.|$|R
6000|$|PATTY. If Miss Phoebe were to <b>dress</b> <b>young</b> {{again and}} put candles {{in her eyes}} {{that used to be}} so bright, and coax back her curls-- ...|$|R
60|$|Effectively, Sir, {{the next}} moment my eyes were gladdened {{by the sight of}} a lovely woman, beautifully <b>dressed,</b> <b>young,</b> charming, smiling but to hide her anxiety, trustful, and {{certainly}} wealthy.|$|R
60|$|Peters {{looked up}} in astonishment. The voice was that of Ned Martin, but he scarce {{recognized}} in the handsomely <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> officer the lad he had last seen a year before.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Bultiwell {{looked up}} with a well-assumed frown of annoyance. A very fashionably <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> lady, {{attractive}} notwithstanding a certain sullenness of expression, had entered the room carrying a great bunch of roses.|$|R
60|$|Without {{ceremony}} Meeker led {{his guests}} {{directly into the}} dining-room, a long and rather narrow room, wherein a woman and six or seven roughly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> men were sitting at a rudely appointed table.|$|R
2500|$|Her career {{reached the}} US as well, and in 1912 she {{performed}} at the first Royal Variety Performance as 'The Piccadilly Johnny with the Little Glass Eye': [...] "The most perfectly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> man in the house".|$|R
25|$|Vittorio Matteo Corcos (4 October 1859 – 8 November 1933) was an Italian painter, {{known for}} his portraits. Many of his genre works depict winsome and finely <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> men and women, in moments of repose and recreation.|$|R
60|$|He {{passed down}} the lounge, more crowded {{now than when}} he had entered. A very fashionably <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> woman, one of a smart tea party, {{leaned back in her}} chair as he passed and held out her hand.|$|R

60|$|A girl, undeniably pretty, with dark, red-gold hair, {{wearing a}} long ermine coat and {{followed}} by a fashionably <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> man, was making her way up the room. She suddenly recognised Philip's companion and came towards her with outstretched hand.|$|R
6000|$|... "And I'm {{not quite}} so sure about you," [...] he observed, {{watching}} the colour rise quickly in her cheeks. [...] "Off with you to <b>dress,</b> <b>young</b> woman. It's past seven, and we must be there early. I still have the wine to order." ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{a relief}} when a sudden detour landed the machine on a cross way, leading through {{interlacing}} pepper trees, to a small but attractive bungalow. A pretty, neatly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> woman {{sat on the porch}} sewing. She rose as the car stopped.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Gloria gives Manny's (Rico Rodriguez) {{surprise}} date, Whitney (Kristen Schaal), a shabbily <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> twenty-something, {{a makeover}} {{so that she}} can feel better about herself. Cameron ends up meeting Manny's date, who thinks Cameron may be the guy for her after a short conversation.|$|R
6000|$|He laughed. The nicely <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> man meditated {{over the}} handle of his cane. [...] "A bounder of that kind can't have a {{particularly}} nice time," [...] he said, [...] "anyhow. If he does get into a decent school, he must get tremendously cut by all the decent men." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{saw this}} point {{illustrated}} again just recently. I was {{walking with a}} friend of mine and a motor passed bearing a neatly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> man, chatting gaily with a pretty woman. My friend raised his hat and gave it a jaunty and cheery swing in the air as if to wave goodwill and happiness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Havers!" [...] exclaimed a {{voice behind}} them; and a neatly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> man joined the group. [...] "If it's anybody's castle it's the man's who pays the rent, and that's more than Rab Johnstone {{has done for}} long, I'm thinking. If ye an' Miss Chatterton are for {{stepping}} in to see Mary we'd take it kindly, sir." ...|$|R
50|$|Lilian <b>dresses</b> <b>young</b> and revealingly and {{is quite}} unreserved, fun-loving, optimistic and outspoken. She seems keen {{to find a}} man and will seize on {{virtually}} any suitable target. She is always bubbly and happy on the surface but this seems to mask a real sadness which she sometimes lets show, like when she admits she doesn't like living alone.|$|R
60|$|Let us now examine Bailey. He is a faultlessly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> man {{of about}} twenty-seven, who takes it as a {{compliment}} when people think him older. His mouth, at present gaping with agitation and the unwonted exercise, is, as a rule, primly closed. His eyes, peering through gold-rimmed glasses, protrude slightly, giving him something of the dumb pathos of a codfish.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{need not}} walk after all," [...] said Ozma. So they stood {{still in their}} places and let the steel bridge draw them onward. Indeed, the bridge drew them well into the glass-domed {{building}} which covered the island, and soon they found themselves standing in a marble room where two handsomely <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> men stood on a platform to receive them.|$|R
40|$|A color {{illustration}} of a neatly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> man and woman. The young man holds a raised Red Cross flag in one hand; {{his other hand}} is raised and index finger extended. The young woman wears a yellow dress and carries a Red Cross box, a wooden board-game box, and a child's dress in her arms. A town {{is seen in the}} background...|$|R
50|$|She went, and the gooseherd {{went with}} all his geese. Everyone stared, but the prince, who was the finely <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> man, rose up and told his father {{that this was the}} woman he wished to marry. The gooseherd played on his pipe, and all Tattercoats's {{clothing}} was transformed into shining robes, and the geese into pages holding her train. Everyone approved, and the prince married her.|$|R
60|$|A vast interminable {{place it}} seemed to Kipps, with unending shining {{counters}} and innumerable faultlessly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> men and presently Houri-like young women staring at him. Here {{there was a long}} vista of gloves dangling from overhead rods, there ribbons and baby-linen. A short young lady in black mittens was making out the account of a customer, and was clearly confused in her addition by Shalford's eagle eye.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I've seen just as fine ladies as your ma {{give their}} {{children}} lozenges in church," [...] said Peg loftily. She put a peppermint {{in her own}} mouth and sucked it with gusto. We were relieved, for she did not talk during the process; but our relief was of short duration. A bevy of three very smartly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> ladies, sweeping past our pew, started Peg off again.|$|R
2500|$|The {{tradition}} {{developed from}} the realism and detailed background activity of Early Netherlandish painting, which Hieronymus Bosch and Pieter Bruegel the Elder {{were among the first}} to turn into their principal subjects, also making use of proverbs. The Haarlem painters Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech, Frans Hals and Esaias van de Velde were important painters early in the period. Buytewech painted [...] "merry companies" [...] of finely <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> people, with moralistic significance lurking in the detail.|$|R
60|$|She saw once {{or twice}} a tall, roughly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> farmer, who seemed to be looking at her steadily, and there was {{something}} in his glance, a timid worshipful expression, that touched her and made her observe him more closely. He was very farmer-like, she noticed; his cheap coat fitted him badly, and his hat was old and shapeless. Yet there was something natively fine and chivalrous in his admiration. She felt that.|$|R
60|$|From Dover Philip rode to Canterbury. He saw in {{the streets}} he passed through many faces he knew, among them some of his former schoolfellows; and he {{wondered}} to himself that these were so little changed, while he was so altered that none recognized, in the handsomely <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> cavalier, the lad they had known; although several stopped to look at, and remark on, the splendid horses ridden by the gentleman and his attendant.|$|R
50|$|After {{the first}} stage of the {{competition}} where the girls were dressed in bathing suits, were chosen the top 15 contestants, who in the second stage came in <b>dresses</b> <b>young</b> designers. In addition, the yield was in evening dress, traditionally provided by a fashion designer Valentin Yudashkin. The final test for the contestants, there was intellectual contest: each of the participants were asked, and the jury assessed a sense of humor and knowledge of participants.|$|R

60|$|Mrs. Rivers did not, and {{the next}} day Jack and his companions sought fresh playing fields and some new story-telling pastures. Indeed, it was a fine sight to see this pale, handsome, elegantly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> fellow {{lounging}} along between a blue-checkered pinafored girl {{on one side and a}} barefooted boy on the other. The ranchmen turned and looked after him curiously. One, a rustic prodigal, reduced by dissipation to the swine-husks of ranching, saw fit to accost him familiarly.|$|R
40|$|Cartoon shows a {{well dressed}} man wearing large hat, {{possibly}} George Hanger, walking {{at the corner}} of Bond Street and Piccadilly, there he meets the gaze of a fashionably <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> woman, a prostitute(?), also wearing a large hat and a bustled skirt.

5000|$|One day, Charles {{visits a}} local farm {{to set the}} owner's broken leg and meets his patient's daughter, Emma Rouault. Emma is a beautiful, daintily <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> woman who has {{received}} a [...] "good education" [...] in a convent. She has a powerful yearning for luxury and romance inspired by reading popular novels. Charles is immediately attracted to her, and visits his patient far more often than necessary, until Heloise's jealousy puts a stop to the visits.|$|R
60|$|In a quick ensuing silence Miss Sampson rose, {{white as}} her <b>dress.</b> The <b>young</b> women present stared in astonishment and their {{partners}} showed excitement.|$|R
60|$|It {{was that}} of a slim, shapely, elegantly <b>dressed</b> <b>young</b> woman. A scarlet-lined silken hood was half thrown back from the shining mass of the black hair that covered her small head; from her pretty {{shoulders}} dropped a fur cloak, only restrained by a cord and tassel in her small gloved hand. Around her full throat was a double necklace of large white beads, that by some cunning feminine trick relieved with its infantile suggestion the strong decision of her lower face.|$|R
