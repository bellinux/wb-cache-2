5|$|Electricity for Canberra mainly {{comes from}} the {{national}} power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan). Power was first supplied from a thermal plant built in 1913, near the Molonglo River, but this was finally closed in 1957. A 20 megawatt photovoltaic solar plant, described as the largest photovoltaic solar farm in Australia, was officially opened at Royalla on 3 September 2014. The 2.3 megawatt Mount Majura solar farm was opened in Majura on 6 October 2016. Construction is under way on a 13 megawatt solar farm at Mugga Lane, Hume and an 11 megawatt solar farm at Williamsdale. The Williamsdale solar farm was originally planned to be built at Uriarra but faced local opposition. In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot water systems. Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at Belconnen and Mugga Lane. There are currently no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020. This will raise the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. <b>It</b> <b>announced</b> in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these {{are expected to be}} operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power per year from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016.
