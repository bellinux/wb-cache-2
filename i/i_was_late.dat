25|$|ASL makes {{heavy use}} of time-sequenced {{ordering}}, meaning that events are signed {{in the order}} in which they occur. For example, for <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> to class last night because my boss handed me a huge stack of work after lunch yesterday, one would sign 'yesterday lunch finish, boss give-me work big-stack, night class late-me'. In stories, however, ordering is malleable, since one can choose to sequence the events either in {{the order in which}} they occurred or in the order in which one found out about them.|$|E
500|$|A larger-than-life-size bronze {{statue of}} Larkin by {{sculptor}} Martin Jennings was unveiled at Hull Paragon Interchange on 2 December 2010, closing the Larkin 25 events. It is inscribed, [...] "That Whitsun <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> getting away", from the poem, The Whitsun Weddings. [...] Funding for the Â£100,000 statue, designed by Martin Jennings, was raised at charity events and auctions {{with support from}} Hull City Council. The unveiling was accompanied by Nathaniel Seaman's Fanfare for Larkin, composed for the occasion. Five plaques containing Larkin's poems {{were added to the}} floor near the statue in 2011. [...] In December 2012 a memorial bench was installed around a pillar near the statue.|$|E
2500|$|.....<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in {{my arrival}} at the scene on the campus and in {{consequence}} heard only {{the conclusion of the}} speaker's harangue.|$|E
6000|$|... "Be patient, if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> late," [...] {{the woman}} said. [...] "I {{will come as}} soon as I can. If <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late,</b> you will {{know that there are}} Germans about." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will come}} in to-morrow," [...] Laverick promised. [...] "This {{afternoon}} it is quite out of the question. I have {{a crowd of people}} waiting to see me, and several important engagements for which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late</b> already." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh,' said <b>I,</b> 'I <b>am</b> {{not going}} to answer any of your questions, so you may spare {{yourself}} the trouble of putting them. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late</b> enough already; <b>I</b> want help. If you will not guide me yourself, at least help me to find some one else who will.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Glad to meet you, Brotho' Talcott. As I was sayin', Sisto' Wilboo, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late,</b> and so I sent Brotho' Williams. I am ver' sawry"-- ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> at the Court and {{had little}} time to write any till after dinner, and then {{was not in the}} vein; so commentated.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late,</b> {{and unable}} to eat much dinner, {{somewhat}} to my mother's alarm. Love had taken away my appetite.... After dinner, when I was wandering aimlessly about the yard, Tom appeared {{on the other side}} of the fence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yea, my son," [...] quoth Robin--albeit he knew nought of the mule--"and {{bring it}} forth quickly, I prythee, for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late</b> and must <b>be</b> jogging." [...] So {{presently}} the stableman brought forth the mule, and Robin mounted it {{and went on}} his way rejoicing.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> {{would have}} <b>been</b> sitting on that seat if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>been</b> <b>late</b> for the party.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said <b>I,</b> [...] "I <b>am</b> {{not going}} to answer any of your questions, so you may spare {{yourself}} the trouble of putting them. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late</b> enough already; <b>I</b> want help. If you will not guide me yourself, at least help me to find some one else who will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would let a fellow know what time you were coming," [...] Arthur said, rather peevishly, but with an attempt at a smile. [...] "I didn't expect you till evening, so I was having a shack before dressing. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> last night!" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late.</b> The First Act {{was nearly}} over. The play {{was not yet}} alive, neither in the bosoms of the actors nor in the audience. I closed {{the door of the}} box softly, and came forward. The rolling Italian eyes of Hamlet glanced up at me. There came a new impulse over the Court of Denmark.|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{bedroom is}} {{immediately}} {{above the floor}} of the house which is occupied by Miss Carmina and her nurse. Having some little matters of my own to settle, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in taking possession of my room. Before the lights on the staircase were put out, I took the liberty of looking down at the next landing.|$|E
6000|$|JACK. [Sitting {{down between}} them, and {{speaking}} with an artificial joviality.] Sorry <b>I</b> <b>'m</b> <b>late.</b> [He looks lugubriously at the dishes.] Tea, please, mother. Any letters for me? [BARTHWICK hands {{the letter to}} him.] But look here, I say, this has <b>been</b> opened! <b>I</b> do wish you would n't---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, to {{tell you}} the truth, to-day is my birthday--I <b>am</b> twenty to-day--and <b>I</b> know that Pigott, my old nurse, means to give me a little present at breakfast, and she will be dreadfully {{disappointed}} if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late.</b> She has <b>been</b> thinking a great deal about it, you see." ...|$|R
60|$|DAVID [finding {{the subject}} a safe one]. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> kept <b>late</b> {{at the public}} meeting.|$|R
6000|$|... "Immense honour!" [...] said Vivian, {{bowing to}} the ground to the lady. [...] "Oh! my Lord <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late,</b> and made a short cut over Fearnley Bog. It has proved a very Moscow expedition. However, I am keeping you. I shall be {{in time for the}} guava and liqueurs, and you know that is the only {{refreshment}} I ever take." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gentleman," [...] he said, [...] "I won't protract your painful duties {{by asking}} you what you want; but I will ask at once for a small favor, which will not {{prejudice}} those duties in any way. I came down here rather in a hurry perhaps; {{but the truth is}} I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> for an appointment." [...] He looked dispassionately at his watch. [...] "I find there is still some fifteen minutes. Will you wait with me here for that short time; after which I am quite at your service." ...|$|E
60|$|Biddy was astir {{so early}} {{to get my}} breakfast, that, {{although}} I did not sleep at the window an hour, I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea {{that it must be}} late in the afternoon. But long after that, and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready, I wanted the resolution to go down stairs. After all, I remained up there, repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again, until Biddy called to me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{the time}} does slip away!" [...] she sighed. [...] "But really, Dicky, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late</b> in your {{interests}} {{as much as}} anything. <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> paying a few calls. I {{went out to the}} Villa Rosa to see some people who almost live here, and then I met Lady Crawley and she made me go in and have some tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Cher ami! I cannot stop one minute. I dine with Fitzwarrene, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late.</b> <b>I</b> {{have done}} your {{business}} capitally. Here {{is a pretty}} flower! Who do you think gave it me? She did, pardy. On condition, however, that I should bear it to you, with a message; and what a message! {{that you should be}} happy.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said she, [...] "I {{am ready}} any time. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> afraid that <b>I</b> should <b>be</b> <b>late,</b> {{and keep you}} waiting. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very glad that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> in season." ...|$|R
60|$|About a {{week after}} the day of the {{pamphlets}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> upon the harbour-side, and took a turn towards the Master's, as I often did. The door opened, a flood of light came forth upon the road, and I beheld a man taking his departure with friendly salutations. I cannot say how singularly I was shaken to recognise the adventurer Harris. I could not but conclude it was the hand of my lord that had brought him there; and prolonged my walk in very serious and apprehensive thought. It was late when I came home, and there was my lord making up his portmanteau for a voyage.|$|E
60|$|The horses sweated even at walking-pace, but {{anything}} {{was better than}} sitting still in our own dark houses. When we moved off under the full moon we were four couples, one triplet, and Mr. Saumarez rode with the Copleigh girls, and I loitered at {{the tail of the}} procession, wondering with whom Saumarez would ride home. Every one was happy and contented; but we all felt that things were going to happen. We rode slowly: and it was nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb, facing the ruined tank, in the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in coming up; and before I went into the garden, I saw that the horizon to the north carried a faint, dun-colored feather. But no one would have thanked me for spoiling so well-managed an entertainment as this picnic--and a dust-storm, more or less, does no great harm.|$|E
60|$|To {{approach}} this spot {{it was not}} necessary to go through my grounds, for my bit of woods adjoined a considerable stretch of forest-land, and in my morning walks from the mill I often used a path through these woods. The next morning when I took this path <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> because I had unfortunately overslept myself. When I reached the hammock it wanted fifteen minutes to seven o'clock. It was too late for me to do anything, but I was glad to be able to stay there even for a few minutes, to breathe that air, to stand on that ground, to touch that hammock. I did more than that. Why shouldn't I? I got into it. It was a better one than that I had hung there. It was delightfully comfortable. At this moment, gently swinging in that woodland solitude, with the sweet odors of the morning all about me, I felt myself nearer to her than I had ever been before.|$|E
60|$|CAPT. M. So it is. Put it straight, will you? (Aside.) <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>late</b> for parade. Poor Gaddy.|$|R
60|$|CHARLES. [Stroking her {{forehead}} and, {{looking at her}} doubtfully] You go to bed; <b>I</b> won't <b>be</b> <b>late</b> coming up.|$|R
60|$|Capt. M. So it is. Put it straight, will you? (Aside.) <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> <b>late</b> for parade. Poor Gaddy.|$|R
60|$|We {{met at the}} parade-ground at ten: {{the night}} was fearfully hot. The horses sweated even at walking-pace, but {{anything}} was better than sitting still in our own dark houses. When we moved off under the full moon we were four couples, one triplet, and Mr. Saumarez rode with the Copleigh girls, and I loitered at {{the tail of the}} procession, wondering with whom Saumarez would ride home. Every one was happy and contented; but we all felt that things were going to happen.

60|$|Cats {{have the}} credit of being more worldly wise than dogs--of looking more after their own {{interests}} and being less blindly devoted to those of their friends. And we {{men and women are}} naturally shocked at such selfishness. Cats certainly do love a family that has a carpet in the kitchen more than a family that has not; and if there are many children about, they prefer to spend their leisure time next door. But, taken altogether, cats are libeled. Make a friend of one, and she will stick to you through thick and thin. All the cats that I have had have been most firm comrades. I had a cat once that used to follow me about everywhere, until it even got quite embarrassing, and I had to beg her, as a personal favor, not to accompany me any further down the High Street. She used to sit up for me when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> home and meet me in the passage. It made me feel quite like a married man, except that she never asked where I had been and then didn't believe me when I told her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Just a minute, please, {{ladies and}} gentlemen, just a minute. I have just found out--I {{should have known}} it sooner, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>late</b> in coming to this meeting--that the speaker who has just {{addressed}} you has done so in behalf of the Belgian Relief Fund. I understand {{that he is a}} well-known Canadian humourist (ha! ha!) and I am sure that we have all been immensely amused (ha! ha!). He is giving his delightful talks (ha! ha!)--though I didn't know this till just this minute--for the Belgian Relief Fund, and he is giving his services for nothing. I am sure when we realise this, we shall all feel that it has been well worth while to come. I am only sorry that we didn't have a better turn out to-night. But I can assure the speaker that if he will come again, we shall guarantee him a capacity audience. And I may say, that if there are any members of this association who have not paid their dollar this season, they can give it either to myself or to Mr. Sibley as they pass out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have <b>been</b> playing, <b>I</b> fear, the mooncalf to-night; {{and find}} that, though <b>I</b> <b>am</b> a <b>late</b> watcher, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not a solitary one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am charmed, my love, quite charmed," [...] said Lord Henry, {{elevating}} {{his dark}} crescent-shaped eyebrows {{and looking at}} them both with an amused smile. [...] "So sorry <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>late,</b> Dorian. <b>I</b> went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street, and had to bargain for hours for it. Nowadays people know the price of everything, {{and the value of}} nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|So I ate and drank, she {{waiting on}} me very gently; but now, being weary of painful writing, {{and hearing the}} call to the refectory, and the brethren {{trampling}} thither, I must break off, for, if <b>I</b> <b>be</b> <b>late,</b> they will sconce me of my ale. Alas! it is to these little cares of creature comforts that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> come, who have seen the face of so many a war, and lived and fought on rat's flesh at Compiegne.|$|R
