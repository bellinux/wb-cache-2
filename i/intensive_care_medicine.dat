In Scandinavia, anesthesiology is the medical specialty that is engaged in the fields of anesthesia, <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>medicine,</b> pain control medicine, pre-hospital and in-hospital emergency medicine. Anesthesiologist in the Scandinavian countries is a doctor who has completed a six-year undergraduate training program (from medical school), a twelve-month internship, and a five-year residency program. SSAI currently hosts five training programs for anesthesiologists in Scandinavia. These are Intensive care, Pediatric anesthesiology and intensive care, Advanced pain medicine, Critical care medicine, and Advanced obstetric anesthesiology.|$|E

25|$|A nephrologist is a {{physician}} who specializes in the care and treatment of kidney disease. Nephrology requires additional training to become an expert with advanced skills.

25|$|Secondary care medical {{services}} {{are provided by}} medical specialists in their offices or clinics or at local community hospitals for a patient referred by a primary care provider who first diagnosed or treated the patient.

25|$|Trainees {{wishing to}} hold dual {{accreditation}} in anaesthesia and <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>medicine</b> may enter anaesthesia training via the Acute Care Common Stem (ACCS) program which lasts {{three years and}} consists of experience in anaesthesia, emergency medicine, acute medicine and intensive care. Trainees in anaesthesia are called Specialty Registrars (StR) or Specialist Registrars (SpR). The Certificate of Completion of Training(CCT) in anaesthesia {{is divided into three}} levels: Basic, intermediate and advanced. During this time, physicians learn anaesthesia as applicable to all surgical specialties. The curriculum focuses on a modular format, with trainees primarily working in one special area during one module, for example: cardiac anaesthesia, neuro-anaesthesia, ENT, maxillofacial, pain medicine, intensive care, and trauma. Traditionally (before the advent of the foundation program), trainees entered anaesthesia from other specialties, such as medicine or accidents and emergencies. Specialist training takes at least seven years. On completion of specialist training, physicians are awarded CCT and are eligible for entry on the GMC Specialist register and are also able to work as consultant anaesthetist. A new consultant in anaesthetics must have completed a minimum of 14 years of training (including: five to six years of medical school training, two years of foundation training, and seven years of anaesthesia training).|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{the last}} few years new {{approaches}} to the diagnosis and management of abdominal trauma were introduced, and in addition, monitoring of individual organ function in the <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> units has become an almost daily practice. In our article we review the principles of assessment and management of injured individual abdominal organs from surgical and <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> <b>medicine’s</b> point of view. Conclusions: Appropriate diagnostics and, precise and timely decision for surgery are the most important factors in the management of patients with blunt abdominal trauma. The mechanism of injury, presence of concomitant injuries, lifethreatening condition and competence of medical staff have to be taken into consideration. The most often injured organs, spleen and liver, are nowadays managed mostly non-operatively. Such an approach has resulted in an increased admission of patients to the <b>intensive</b> <b>care</b> unit, with an attempt to prevent secondary organ dysfunction and multiple-organ failure. These new treatment options have contributed to lower morbidity and mortality and improved quality of life...|$|R
