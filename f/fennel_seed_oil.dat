The oil content of the samples ranged from 16. 9 to 53. 4 g/ 100 g. The dominating fatty acids were oleic acid (apricot seed oil, peanut oil, and chufa seed oil) in the range of 52. 5 to 68. 4 g/ 100 g and linoleic acid (pear seed oil, apple seed oil, cottonseed oil and quince seed oil) with 48. 1 to 56. 3  g/ 100  g, while in linseed oil mainly α-linolenic acid (53. 2 g/ 100 g) and in <b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil</b> mainly 18 : 1 fatty acids (80. 5 g/ 100 g) with petroselinic acid predominating. The total content of vitamin-E-active compounds ranged from 20. 1 (<b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> <b>oil)</b> to 96 mg/ 100 g (apple seed oil). The predominant isomers were established as α- and γ-tocopherol...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to clarify, for the first time in Morocco, the impact of culture on seed yield, growth parameters, yield and antioxidant activity of <b>seed</b> essential <b>oils</b> obtained from wild and cultivated fennel. The cultivation test was installed according to the principles of organic agriculture in a parcel at the oasis of Oukhite South East of Morocco under a completely randomized design with three replications. The agro-morphological characteristics were evaluated during two successive years (2014 and 2015). The results showed that fennel produces more of seed and total dry matter under culture conditions and both are more important in second year. The best performance of seed yield and total dry matter are 20. 53  qx/ha and 199. 79  qx/ha respectively. Domestication has not improved the yield and the antioxidant activities of <b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> essential <b>oils.</b> In fact, wild fennel presented an essential oil yield significantly high (3. 67 %) compared to cultivated fennel (2. 13 %). For both applied tests DPPH and reducing power, essential oil obtained from wild plant presented the most important antioxidant power (IC 50 : 10. 62  ±  0. 33 and 29. 49  ±  0. 52  mg/mL) compared to that extracted from cultivated plant (IC 50 : 13. 08  ±  0. 34 and 32. 30  ±  0. 02  mg/mL). However, fennel cultivation is promising. It will permit to achieve interesting seed yields and may be good alternative to safeguard this species as well as to be used as an antioxidant natural source...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> are {{a source}} of many nutrients, i. e. sugars, minerals, {{essential}} fatty acids, vital vitamins, protein and fibre. They are also rich in essential oil and many flavonoids. The sweet-flavoured <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> are very popular worldwide and are extensively used in culinary and therapeutic fields. Bread fortified with <b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> powder is thus likely to have higher consumer acceptability than white or other fortified bread. In this study, bread samples were prepared by supplementing white flour with <b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> powder at the levels of 3. 0, 5. 0, 7. 0, 10. 0 and 15. 0 % and their physical, sensory, antioxidant and staling characteristics were determined.

An attempt has been made to understand the role of <b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> powder in the bread samples during storage. Antioxidant activity (i. e. total phenolic content, ferric reducing antioxidant power and 2, 2 - -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging) showed an increase up to 7. 0 % level of supplementation. Bread with <b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> content between 5. 0 and 7. 0 % showed the highest acceptability among the fortified bread samples...|$|R

The aim {{was to assess the}} health and physiological quality of <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), both freshly harvested and stored for three years, and submitted to thermotherapy. Two experiments were conducted. In the first, thermotherapy was carried out on freshly-harvested <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> obtained under different cropping systems: T 1 - Monocrop fennel treated with the insecticide, thiamethoxam; T 2 - Monocrop fennel without the application of insecticide; T 3 - Fennel intercropped with cotton and treated with insecticide; T 4 - Intercropped fennel without the application of insecticide. In the second experiment, seeds were used which had been stored for three years and obtained from plants, both treated and untreated with insecticide. The seeds were exposed to dry heat for different periods (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 days) at 70 °C. The tests performed included: health, germination, first count, speed germination index, seedling length and dry weight. The cropping systems had no influence on the incidence of the fungus Alternaria sp. Stored <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> coming from plants treated with insecticide, display better health and physiological quality.

40|$|The fennel aphids, Hyadaphis foeniculi (Passerini) (Hemiptera: Aphididae) attack umbels and may thus,cause {{to failure}} of fruit setting and also attack during {{the phase of}} seed development. Our {{research}} investigated the severity of biomass, <b>seed</b> and essential <b>oil</b> damages related to infestation by the fennel aphid, H. foeniculi in fennel (Foeniculum vulgare Miller) plots and plots of fennel intercropped with cotton with colored fibers. A randomized complete block design was used with four treatments: (1) two rows offennel: three rows of cotton (2 F: 3 C) (non-treated plot), (2) two rows of fennel: three rows of cotton (2 F: 3 C) (treated plot), (3) fennel (F) (non-treated plot), and (4) fennel (F) (treated-plot), with four replications. The average {{of the weight of}} <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> from umbels in the green stage in treated plots (0. 19 mg) washigher (21 %) than in the non-treated plots (0. 15 mg). There {{was no significant difference in}} the essential oilextracted from biomass between two cropping systems for both treated and non-treated plots. However,the amount of essential oil extracted from fennel biomass in treated plots was higher in fennel plots thanin fennel in non-treated plots. The average of the essential <b>oil</b> of 1000 <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> from fennel-cotton intercropping system (0. 17 ml) was higher (18 %) than in the fennel cropping system (0. 14 mg). The aphid attack reduced 29 % of <b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> weight. On the other hand, the average amount of essential oil extractedof the non-attacked seeds was two folds higher than of the attacked seeds. Therefore, our results showed that the effects of H. foeniculi on these yield components were smaller in the plots with fennel-cotton intercropping than in fennel plots. We suggest that seed composition responses to H. foeniculi injury should be an important consideration when conducting research to develop IPM systems for this fennel pest. 201...|$|R
