5|$|As Messi {{maintained}} his goalscoring <b>form</b> <b>into</b> {{the second half}} of the season, the year 2012 saw him break several longstanding records. On 7 March, two weeks after scoring four goals in a league fixture against Valencia, he scored five times in a Champions League last 16-round match against Bayer Leverkusen, an unprecedented achievement in the history of the competition. In addition to being the joint top assist provider with five assists, this feat made him top scorer with 14 goals, tying José Altafini's record from the 1962–63 season, as well as becoming only the second player after Gerd Müller to be top scorer in four campaigns. Two weeks later, on 20 March, Messi became the top goalscorer in Barcelona's history at 24 years old, overtaking the 57-year record of César Rodríguez's 232 goals with a hat-trick against Granada.|$|E
5|$|At birth {{the lungs}} are very undeveloped with only around one sixth of the alveoli {{of the adult}} lung present. The alveoli {{continue}} to <b>form</b> <b>into</b> early adulthood, {{and their ability to}} form when necessary is seen in the regeneration of the lung. Alveolar septa have a double capillary network instead of the single network of the developed lung. Only after the maturation of the capillary network can the lung enter a normal phase of growth. Following the early growth in numbers of alveoli there is another stage of the alveoli being enlarged.|$|E
5|$|Cardus's {{approach}} to cricket writing was innovative, turning what {{had previously been}} largely a factual <b>form</b> <b>into</b> vivid description and criticism; he is considered by contemporaries to have influenced every subsequent cricket writer. Although he achieved his largest readership for his cricket reports and books, he considered music criticism as his principal vocation. Without any formal musical training, he was initially influenced by the older generation of critics, in particular Samuel Langford and Ernest Newman, but developed his own individual style of criticism—subjective, romantic and personal, {{in contrast to the}} objective analysis practised by Newman. Cardus's opinions and judgments were often forthright and unsparing, which sometimes caused friction with leading performers. Nevertheless, his personal charm and gregarious manner enabled him to form lasting friendships in the cricketing and musical worlds, with among others Newman, Sir Thomas Beecham and Sir Donald Bradman.|$|E

5|$|Contrails are a manmade type of cirrus cloud {{formed when}} water vapor from the exhaust of a jet engine {{condenses}} on particles, which come {{from either the}} surrounding air or the exhaust itself, and freezes, leaving behind a visible trail. The exhaust can also trigger the formation of cirrus by providing ice nuclei {{when there is an}} insufficient naturally-occurring supply in the atmosphere. One of the environmental impacts of aviation is that persistent contrails can <b>form</b> <b>into</b> large mats of cirrus, and increased air traffic has been implicated as one possible cause of the increasing frequency and amount of cirrus in Earth's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Federer's {{first and}} only title of 2013 came at the Gerry Weber Open (def. Mikhail Youzhny), where he also played doubles with good friend Tommy Haas. With the victory in Halle, he tied John McEnroe for the third-most number of ATP titles won by a male player in the Open Era. Federer, however, was unable to {{maintain}} his <b>form</b> <b>into</b> Wimbledon, suffering his worst Grand Slam tournament defeat since 2003 {{in the second round}} against Sergiy Stakhovsky. Not only did the loss end Federer's record streak of 36 consecutive quarterfinals at Grand Slam tournaments, it meant he would drop out of the top 4 for first time since July 2003, exactly 10 years after he won his first Wimbledon title.|$|E
5|$|He {{continued}} his good <b>form</b> <b>into</b> 2002, where his run-scoring earned him {{an invitation to}} play for the Marylebone Cricket Club against the Sri Lankans. He scored 77 in a drawn match, and would later that season make his Test match debut against India. However, following his Test debut, he only passed 50 on one further occasion that year. He would maintain his place in the Test side against Zimbabwe the following year, despite only scoring one innings of note129 against the Cambridge students. However, after being dropped from the side, Key's form seemed to improve: he scored 140 against Nottinghamshire to set up a Kent victory, and consistently scored around 40runs per innings {{for the remainder of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|In 1640, {{masses of}} Chinese peasants who were starving, {{unable to pay}} their taxes, and no longer in fear of the {{frequently}} defeated Chinese army, began to <b>form</b> <b>into</b> huge bands of rebels. The Chinese military, caught between fruitless efforts to defeat the Manchu raiders {{from the north and}} huge peasant revolts in the provinces, essentially fell apart. Unpaid and unfed, the army was defeated by Li Zicheng – now self-styled as the Prince of Shun – and deserted the capital without much of a fight. On 26 May 1644, Beijing fell to a rebel army led by Li Zicheng when the city gates were opened by rebel allies from within. During the turmoil, the last Ming emperor hanged himself on a tree in the imperial garden outside the Forbidden City.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May a French {{ship was}} seen and followed, which {{after three days}} led the British to the main French fleet. Howe gave the order to prepare for battle at 09:45 on 28May and at 10:35 to <b>form</b> <b>into</b> two columns. In an attempt to force an action, some of the fastest ships were sent to attack the French rear, which they did {{throughout}} the day, both causing and receiving some damage. The two fleets came together on 29May, and a limited engagement took place that petered out and became a general chase after an attempt to cut the French line was mistimed. Thick fog prevented any further action {{for the next two}} days.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{formation}} of Tropical Depression Fourteen, the southern Caribbean Sea was under a large area of low pressure. On October 30, satellite imagery showed that the area of pressure was beginning to <b>form</b> <b>into</b> a tropical disturbance. A reconnaissance aircraft was scheduled for the next morning to investigate the forming system, but by 1400 UTC on October 31, the National Hurricane Center in Miami, Florida had upgraded the system to a tropical depression based on the imagery and surface data. At this time, the specialists at the Hurricane Center believed that this was its most developed stage of its lifetime.|$|E
5|$|Taylor {{carried her}} good <b>form</b> <b>into</b> the {{subsequent}} series against New Zealand, starting the second leg of their trip with a half-century against New Zealand A in a warm-up match {{in which she}} was acting captain. England struggled in the first ODI however: only Taylor and Edwards reached double figures for the tourists as they suffered a 123-run loss. In the following match, Taylor scored the seventh international century of her career, remaining 111 not out as England secured a nine-wicket win over New Zealand. She scored a half-century in the third ODI of the series, and 34 runs in the fifth to finish as England's leading run-scorer of the tour, scoring 342 runs at an average of 48.85 from the nine ODI matches in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the system was a cold front that moved off the U.S. East Coast on September 11.

On the afternoon of September 17, the system was organized enough to be declared Tropical Depression Four.|$|E

5|$|The process {{involves}} procedurally-generated {{basic elements}} like elevation, rainfall, mineral distribution, drainage and temperature. For example, a high-rainfall and low-drainage area {{would make a}} swamp. Areas are thus categorized into biomes, which have two variables: savagery and alignment. They have their own specific type {{of plant and animal}} populations. The next phase is erosion—which the drainage simulates. Rivers are created by tracing their paths from the mountains (which get eroded) to its end which is usually an ocean; some <b>form</b> <b>into</b> lakes. The salinity field defines oceans, mangroves or alluvial plains. Names are generated for the biomes and rivers. The names depend on the area's good/evil variable (the alignment) and though in English, they are originally in one of the four in-game languages of dwarves, elves, humans and goblins; these are the four main races in any generated world.|$|E
5|$|After any of {{the above}} {{approaches}} are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex, an actual sequence of nucleotides that will <b>form</b> <b>into</b> the desired structure must be devised. Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation. Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy, and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable, while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored. This is done either through simple, faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization, or by using a full nearest-neighbor thermodynamic model, which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive. Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained.|$|E
5|$|All {{available}} lorries and camels were organised in convoys moving {{north from}} the railhead along the Gaza to Junction Station road from Deir el Belah to El Mejdel {{and then on}} to Julis, where the 26 and 27 Depot Unit of Supply (DUS) set up advanced supply dumps to serve the Australian Mounted Division and the Anzac Mounted Division. From these dumps the Transport Sections of 5 Company (New Zealand Army Service Corps) and the 32nd, 33rd, and 34th Companies (Australian Army Service Corps) served the Anzac Mounted Division, and the 35th, 36th, and 37th Companies served the Australian Mounted Division. These companies of horse- and mule-drawn wagons could operate to serve their brigades during brigade operations and when required could <b>form</b> <b>into</b> divisional trains during divisional operations. A forward lorry-head was established at Ramleh, where the loads were dumped and the Transport Companies distributed the supplies to the forward units. Members of the Egyptian Labour Corps (as second drivers) worked alongside the Australian Army Service Corps transporting, loading, and unloading the General Service and Limber wagons of supplies ordered by the brigades. The huge endeavour was administered by the supply sections in a similar fashion to the divisional ammunition columns which also worked to supply ammunition to the fighting units in a similarly continuous operation.|$|E
