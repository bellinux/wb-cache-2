500|$|During the post-race press conference, Hamilton {{revealed}} {{the decision to}} pit him was made after he had voiced concern over the heat in his tyres, being under the false impression that his rivals behind had already made a pit stop for the softer compound. When asked whether he would have full confidence in the team's strategy decisions in the future, he answered [...] "yes". At the podium interviews, conducted by Martin Brundle, Rosberg admitted his victory [...] "was <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> luck" [...] and added that [...] "Lewis drove brilliantly {{and he would have}} also deserved the win for sure".

A few days before his arrest, a neighbor said he heard semiautomatic gunfire coming from an open field behind Schlesselman's house. After his arrest, Schlesselman's family expressed doubt that he seriously intended {{to carry out the}} plot; his father, Mike, said, [...] "I think it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> talk.

500|$|Fritz the Cat {{is set in}} a [...] "modern 'supercity' of {{millions}} of animals." [...] Stories begin simply and become increasingly chaotic and complex as the narrative responds to uncontrollable forces. The look of Fritz the Cat comics was characterized by the use of the Rapidograph technical pen and a simple drawing style Robert Crumb used to facilitate his story telling. Crumb states that much of the comic books he enjoyed as a child were funny animal comics, particularly those of Carl Barks. Crumb was later influenced by Walt Kelly's daily anthropomorphic funny animal comic strip Pogo; Crumb did not copy Kelly's comics directly, but states that he imitated his drawing style closely; Crumb admired Kelly's storytelling style, which [...] "seemed [...] plotless and casually done. The characters talked to each other and nothing much happened. <b>Just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> foolishness takes place". Robert Crumb stated of his anthropomorphic work: ...|$|E
500|$|Production {{began in}} 1972. However, Steve Krantz {{had not yet}} paid Bakshi {{for his work on}} Fritz the Cat. Halfway through the {{production}} of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked Krantz outright when he would be paid, and Krantz responded that [...] "The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> noise." [...] Bakshi found Krantz's claims to be dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills. Because Bakshi did not have a lawyer, he sought advice from directors he had become friends with, including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, and Steven Spielberg, asking them how much they made on their films. Bakshi soon accused Krantz of ripping him off, which the producer denied. Bakshi began pitching his next project, Harlem Nights, a film loosely based on the Uncle Remus story books. The idea interested producer Albert S. Ruddy during a screening of The Godfather.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics were}} less {{enthusiastic}} {{than the general}} consensus. Although The New Republic Sacha Zimmerman stated that the episode's aesthetic features were comparable to cinematic works, she affirmed that Mad Men lacked any substance, ultimately criticizing the cultural references and the character development presented in the episode. Mad Men seems to be attempting satire without a plan," [...] Zimmerman said. [...] "The mood is serious, not campy, and there aren't laugh-out-loud moments, <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> groaners—at which point, the show simply becomes a reflection of its characters: depressing. It turns out that watching moody, cruel men and unsatisfied, put-upon women for an hour just isn't that much fun." [...] Similarly, Tim Shale of The Washington Post concluded that despite the evocative nature of the program, [...] "Smokes Gets in Your Eyes" [...] fell flat; [...] "The people in and around them spoil the show, gum up the works and shatter veracity." [...] To New York John Leonard, the installment felt like a [...] "fifties leftover".|$|E

As he had gotten more sensitive in his older age, his owners always praised him for the gifts, which ranged from a full picnic basket to roadkill. One night, he [...] "finds" [...] a baby, who was kidnapped from a wealthy household by a disgruntled former employee and his kin. The baby had been set in the grass by his two kidnappers while they changed a flat tire. The kidnappers eventually catch up to Lad, who is carrying the child home.

500|$|The second sequel, Species III {{followed}} in 2004. It premiered on Sci-Fi Channel on November 27, 2004 with a DVD release on December 7. The film's plot starts where Species II ends, revolving around Sunny Mabrey's character Sara, {{the daughter of}} Eve, reared by a doctor played by Robert Knepper. Sara, an alien-human hybrid, seeks other hybrids to mate with. Henstridge cameos {{at the beginning of}} the film. Two out of six critics mentioned on Rotten Tomatoes gave it a positive rating, with DVD Talk's reviewer noting that it is [...] "a more cohesive and sensible flick than [...] is, but ultimately, it's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the same old schtick", while Film Freak Central called it [...] "amateurish" [...] and [...] "vapid". A fourth film, Species: The Awakening was filmed in 2007, following the schedule of Species III of Sci-Fi Channel premiere and subsequent DVD release. None of the actors from the original film returned in this sequel, which instead starred Helena Mattsson as the alien-hybrid seductress.|$|E

[...] "Hey Daddy (Daddy's Home)", one of the tracks that follows-up Usher's divorce, and the change in content from Here I Stand, back to Confessions-style, was one of six tracks co-written by Rico Love for the album. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, Love said of Usher's return to that style, [...] "I feel like he’s got his mind right and it’s focused. He went through a lot. He had lost his father when he was creating the Here I Stand record, {{a lot of controversy}} with his marriage, he had kids, he parted ways with his mother’s management, and there were <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> things going on and he kind of lost focus.

500|$|By {{the time}} Fritz the Cat was released, Bakshi {{had become a}} celebrity, but his {{reputation}} was primarily based upon his having directed the first [...] "dirty" [...] animated film. Facing criticism of his work on publicity tours and in trade publications, he began writing poetry to express his emotions. This became a tradition, and Bakshi wrote poems before beginning production on each of his films. The first of these poems was [...] "Street Arabs", which preceded the production of Heavy Traffic in 1972. Inspiration for the film came from penny arcades, where Bakshi often played pinball, sometimes accompanied by his 12-year-old son, Mark. Bakshi pitched Heavy Traffic to Samuel Z. Arkoff, who expressed interest in his take on the [...] "tortured underground cartoonist" [...] and agreed to back the film. Krantz had not compensated Bakshi {{for his work on}} Fritz the Cat, and halfway through the production of Heavy Traffic, Bakshi asked when he would be paid. Krantz responded, [...] "The picture didn't make any money, Ralph. It's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> noise." [...] Bakshi found Krantz's claims dubious, as the producer had recently purchased a new BMW and a mansion in Beverly Hills.

500|$|Some reviewers {{said that}} the second act of the game, {{taking place in the}} less-structured portion of the old Aperture facilities, may be {{confusing}} to some players. Young wrote that in the second act, the game [...] "cranks up the difficulty level at a speed that may dishearten casual gamers", and said that particularly when traveling between chambers, he had [...] "absolutely no idea where I was supposed to head next". [...] Kohler wrote that while the player can explore the abandoned areas of Aperture, [...] "none of it ever does anythingit's <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> sterile, duplicated, non-interactive environments". Watters wrote that the loading time between the game's levels, in contrast to earlier Valve games, are [...] "long enough to make you take notice and wish they were shorter". Watters also said that it was unfortunate that the game lacks [...] "stand-alone test chambers and leaderboards...but even so, Portal 2 is not light on content" [...] without these. Welsh {{said that the}} attempt to recapture the spirit of the song [...] "Still Alive" [...] at the end credits of Portal 2 [...] "was a mistake". Video game critic Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw named it the best game of 2011 in his review show Zero Punctuation. However he wrote in his Extra Punctuation column that, while Portal 2 was a [...] "very good game", it unnecessarily retconned portions of the origin game's story, and did not really further the game's concept. However, this criticism was directed solely at the campaign, and he stated that he found the game's co-op to be [...] "much more appealing and much more within the spirit of the original".|$|E
