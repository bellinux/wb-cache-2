40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to explore impact of {{globalization}} on the tax mixes of the OECD countries. The research object is the tax mix of 21 OECD member countries in the period 1965 - 2003. The relation of tax mixes and globalization, which expresses oneself through a tax competition, is analysed by methods of multidimensional statistical analysis. First, the cluster analysis enables us to identify countries` clusters (subgroups of the OECD group of countries) with similar tax mixes in the observed period. Consequently, the <b>discriminatory</b> <b>analysis</b> explains the reasons of the resulting grouping of the countries. Within {{the scope of the}} <b>discriminatory</b> <b>analysis</b> we take into account selected variables of globalization quantified {{on the basis of the}} globalization indices (economical, social and political index).

40|$|Purpose: The wide-spread use of organophosphorus {{pesticides}} (OPP) {{and their}} substantial toxicity determine the high frequency of poisoning with them. Despite the modern treatment methods, the acute exogenous intoxications (AEI) continue to exhibit high lethality {{and are the}} source {{of one of the most}} serious problems in the clinical toxicology.

Temporally matched bovine milk isolates and clinical human invasive isolates (52 each) collected in New York State over 18 months {{were characterized by}} molecular subtyping and phenotypic methods to probe the interspecies transmission potential of this species. EcoRI ribotyping differentiated 17 ribotypes, and DNA sequencing of the housekeeping gene sodA and the putative virulence gene hylB differentiated 7 and 17 allelic types, respectively. Human and bovine isolates were not randomly distributed between ribotypes or hylB and sodA clusters. The combined analysis of all subtyping data allowed the differentiation of 39 clonal groups; 26 groups contained only bovine isolates, and 2 groups contained both human and bovine isolates. The EcoRI ribotype diversity among bovine isolates (Simpson's numerical index of discrimination [mean ± standard deviation], 0. 90 ± 0. 05) being significantly higher than that among human isolates (0. 42 ± 0. 15) further supports that these isolates represent distinct populations. Eight human isolates, but no bovine isolates, showed an IS 1548 transposon insertion in hylB, which encodes a hyaluronidase. Based on data for 43 representative isolates, human isolates, on average, showed lower hyaluronidase activities than bovine isolates. Isolates with the IS 1548 insertion in hylB showed no hyaluronidase activity. Human and bovine isolates {{did not differ in}} their abilities to invade HeLa human epithelial cells.

These in silico selection and prioritization techniques are usually based on two central approaches- the examination of similarities to known disease genes and/or the evaluation of functional annotation of genes. Each of these approaches has its own caveats. Here we employ a previously described method of candidate gene prioritization based mainly on gene annotation, in accompaniment with a technique based on the evaluation of pertinent sequence motifs or signatures, {{in an attempt to}} refine the gene prioritization approach. We apply this approach to X-linked mental retardation (XLMR), a group of heterogeneous disorders for which some of the underlying genetics is known. Results: The gene annotation-based binary filtering method yielded a ranked list of putative XLMR candidate genes with good plausibility of being associated with the development of mental retardation. In parallel, a motif finding approach based on linear <b>discriminatory</b> <b>analysis</b> (LDA) was employed to identify short sequence patterns that may discriminate XLMR from non-XLMR genes. High rates (> 80 %) of correct classification was achieved, suggesting that the identification of these motifs effectively captures genomic signals associated with XLMR vs. non-XLMR genes.

40|$|Multi {{criteria}} {{methods for}} supporting decision-making procedures {{are widely used}} in sustainability assessment. One {{of the most important}} steps in decision-making procedures is the evaluation of policy options or alternatives in order to find a hierarchy of option choices. Utility function value distributions are often constructed for the range of indicators for the options to be assessed. This distribution can be presented as an impact matrix stacked with indicator weights to reflect the relative importance of different indicators for the decision-maker. Solving rules are then introduced to integrate all individual indicator evaluations into a single integral utility estimation. These are often based on the averaging procedures, one of the simplest being arithmetic averaging. Whilst averaging rules are very attractive to decision makers due to their simplicity and logical transparency, using averaging as the first step of the decision-making procedures can significantly reduce the discrimination of the options, especially if there are counteractive individual indicator estimations. This paper proposes a method to evaluate and overcome this loss of discrimination. The paper explains the basis of a <b>discriminatory</b> <b>analysis</b> approach to sustainability assessment, demonstrating its application through the use of illustrative data and describing its application to an existing case study where researchers had applied a number of multi criteria analysis tools.

Power companies: power plants, distribution companies and vendors of energy in Poland have been included as a single entity. An attempt to determine the factors of macro and micro-economic and financial data, which significantly affected the distinctionbetween the concerns was investigated.

This means that the dominant European companies show a similarity in implementation adopted by the owners of the economic-financial conditions for development. According to factors and the economic contribution to the largest macroeconomic identifying similar groups had the same variables: consumption of electricity in TWh and public debt in% of GDP, which correctly classified all concerns at 100 %.

Molecular genotyping of S. epidermidis from healthy conjunctiva could provide information {{about the origin of}} the strains that infect the eye. In this paper two collections of S. epidermidis were used: one from ocular infection (n = 62), and another from healthy conjunctiva (n = 45). All isolates were genotyped by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequence typing (MLST), staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec), detection of the genes icaA, icaD, IS 256 and polymorphism type of agr locus. The phenotypic data included biofilm production and antibiotic resistance. The results displayed 61 PFGE types from 107 isolates and they were highly <b>discriminatory.</b> MLST <b>analysis</b> generated a total of 25 STs, of which 11 STs were distributed among the ocular infection isolates and lineage ST 2 was the most frequent (48. 4 %), while 14 STs were present in the healthy conjunctiva isolates and lineage ST 5 was the most abundant (24. 4 %). By means of a principal coordinates analysis (PCoA) and a discriminant analysis (DA) it was found that ocular infection isolates had as discriminant markers agr III or agr II, SCCmec V or SCCmec I, mecA gene, resistance to tobramycin, positive biofilm, and IS 256 +. In contrast to the healthy conjunctiva isolates, the discriminating markers were agr I, and resistance to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin and oxacillin. The discriminant biomarkers of ocular infection were examined in healthy conjunctiva isolates, and it was found that 3 healthy conjunctiva isolates [two with ST 2 and another with ST 9] (3 / 45, 6. 66 %) had similar genotypic and phenotypic characteristics to ocular infection isolates, therefore a small population from healthy conjunctiva could cause an ocular infection.

The following aspects were compared: computer-assisted <b>analysis,</b> <b>discriminatory</b> power, and use for epidemiological typing of campylobacters. A set of 50 campylobacter poultry isolates from The Netherlands and neighboring countries was analyzed. Computer-assisted analysis made cluster analysis possible and eased the designation of different genotypes. AFLP fingerprinting was the most discriminatory technique, identifying 41 distinct genotypes, while PFGE identified 38 different types, flaA typing discriminated 31 different types, and ribotyping discriminated 26 different types. Furthermore, AFLP analysis was the most suitable method for computer- assisted data analysis. In some cases combining the results of AFLP fingerprinting, PFGE, and flaA typing increased our ability to differentiate strains that appeared genetically related.

Finally, MICs for the control strains N. nova ATCC BAA- 2227, N. asteroides ATCC 19247 T, and N. farcinica ATCC 23826 were robustly determined to demonstrate method reproducibility and suitability of the commercial Sensititre Rapmyco panel for antimicrobial susceptibility testing ofNocardia spp. isolated from clinical specimens. The reported values will facilitate quality control and standardization among laboratories. Nocardia species are a group of filamentous, branching, Gram-positive, modified-acid-fast bacilli that normally exist as soil saprophytes but can cause disease in immunosuppressed an...|$|R
40|$|Suicide is {{a leading}} cause of death internationally. Prediction of the {{phenomenon}} has proved to be extremely difficult and results in this area have been modest. The objective of this pilot study was to assess the applicability of the Neural Network statistical procedure to suicidal data. The predictive ability of three statistical techniques (Logistic Regression, <b>Discriminatory</b> <b>Analysis</b> and Neural Networks) were compared in the ability to distinguish between suicides and attempts {{on the basis of a}} variety of variables. Although the Neural Network model expresses its full potential with large numbers, it has proved to be effective even in our limited sample. This suggests that neural networks may exhibit superior predictive capacity when the data set is enlarged. This technique may prove to be a useful additional tool in the field of suicide prediction and prevention. No Full Tex...|$|E
40|$|Successful banks {{base their}} {{operations}} {{on the principles}} of liquidity, profitability and safety. Therefore, the correct assessment of the ability of a loan applicant to carry out certain obligations is of crucial importance for the functioning of a bank. In the past few decades several credit scoring models have been developed to provide support to credit analysts in the assessment of a loan applicant. This paper presents three statistical methods that are used for this purpose in the area of credit risk management: logistical regression, <b>discriminatory</b> <b>analysis</b> and survival analysis. Their implementation in the banking sector was motivated to a great extent by the development and application of information and communication technologies. This paper aims to point out the most important theoretical aspects of these methods, but also to actualise the need for the development and application of the credit scoring model in Croatian banking practice...|$|E
40|$|We used via {{light and}} {{scanning}} electron microscopy to study the leaf epidermis of five Solidago taxa from south-western Poland. Light microscopy was employed to describe the epidermal surface, including stomatal types, the shape of epidermal cell walls, stomatal density, the distribution of stomata between the abaxial and adaxial epi-dermis, and stomatal guard cell length. From these observations we calculated the stomatal index (SI) and stom-atal ratio (SR) {{as the basis for}} defining the type of leaf. From LM of transverse sections of leaf we described mes-ophyll structure, the presence of secretory canals, adaxial and abaxial epidermis thickness, and leaf thickness. We examined cuticular ornamentation, trichome features and epicuticular secretions by SEM. As determined by <b>discriminatory</b> <b>analysis,</b> the most important traits distinguishing these taxa were the stomatal index of the adax-ial epidermis, leaf thickness, features of the walls of epidermal cells, and the presence and features of trichomes. On the basis of observations and measurements we created a key for distinguishing Solidago taxa...|$|E
40|$|DNA {{evidence}} {{is one of}} the most prominent types of physical evidence utilised within forensic investigations. There is a sound reasoning behind this – the resources afforded to the development of DNA analysis techniques are immense, allowing the discipline almost unparalleled evidentiary weighting. This fact is reinforced by the popular knowledge of DNA within society, even those who do not have an understanding of the processes involved in DNA analysis are aware of the statistical power carried by this form of evidence. This power comes from the development of more sensitive and <b>discriminatory</b> forms of <b>analysis,</b> culminating to the point that samples previously impossible to analyse can now be a viable source of information. While this progress has allowed DNA its position at the forefront of forensic science, there needs to be awareness of the limitations and risks involved. The sensitivity now found within the science may allow more samples to be tested, but it also means that the concepts of transfer and background DNA are more relevant than ever before. There has been an influx in the amount of literature reporting on these issues and how they can affect the entire process of DNA analysis. Overall, a clear consensus emerged that the risk of contamination or corruption of DNA evidence by DNA present within the environment is a real issue, but one that can be minimised through awareness and effective decontamination protocols...|$|R
40|$|The Internet is and {{has always}} been a space where {{participants}} battle for control. The two core protocols that define the Internet – TCP and IP – are both designed to allow separate networks to connect to each other easily, so that networks that differ not only in hardware implementation (wired vs. satellite vs. radio networks) but also in their politics of control (consumer vs. research vs. military networks) can interoperate easily. It is a feature of the Internet, not a bug, that China – with its extensive, explicit censorship infrastructure – can interact {{with the rest of the}} Internet. In the following collection, published as an open access collection here and as well in a special issue of IEEE Internet Computing, we present five peer reviewed papers on the topic of Internet censorship and control. The topics of the papers include a broad look at information controls, censorship of microblogs in China, new modes of online censorship, the balance of power in Internet governance, and control in the certificate authority model. These papers make it clear that there is no global consensus on what mechanisms of control are best suited for managing conflicts on the Internet, just as there is none for other fields of human endeavour. That said, there is optimism that with vigilance and continuing efforts to maintain transparency the Internet can stay as a force for increasing freedom than a tool for more efficient repression.

40|$|Sources of Mycobacterium bovis {{contamination}} remain unclear {{for many}} cases of animal and human disease. A major limitation {{is the lack of}} sufficiently informative or epidemiologically well evaluated molecular methods for typing. Here, we report an evaluation of a high-throughput method based on 29 mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem-repeat (MIRU-VNTR) loci to genotype 127 M. bovis isolates from cattle from 77 different Belgian farms, representative of a nationwide collection obtained from 1995 to 2003. MIRU-VNTR stability was demonstrated by analyzing a series of 74 isolates in total, obtained from different animals from a single farm or from different farms with an identified epidemiological link. The genotyping results and the genotypic diversity (h) were compared with those obtained by IS 6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis and spoligotyping. Among 68 isolates with no known epidemiological link, MIRU-VNTR typing discriminated better than either RFLP analysis or spoligotyping, with isolates taken individually (32 versus 16 and 17 genotypes; h = 0. 91 versus 0. 73 and 0. 85, respectively) or in combination (32 versus 28 genotypes; h = 0. 91 versus 0. 92). Maximal resolution was already achieved with a subset of 9 loci. The observed congruence of the genetic relationships based on IS 6110 RFLP analysis, spoligotyping, and MIRU-VNTR markers is consistent with a clonal population structure of M. bovis. These results support MIRU-VNTR typing as a convenient and <b>discriminatory</b> technique for <b>analysis</b> of the population structure of M. bovis in much greater detail and for addressing some still unresolved issues in the epidemiology of the pathogen...|$|R
