25|$|A further final {{development}} {{based on}} the Minivan was the Bond Family Safety Saloon. Additional side windows were fitted to the rear compartment of the van and two small hammock type seats were added {{either side of the}} rear <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> inwards. With the bench seat of the tourer replacing the single front seat of the van and pickup, this gave enough room for two children and two adults. The number of Safety Saloons produced is unknown, as factory records do not distinguish between the Saloon and the Minivan.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} {{for an early}} templon comes from the Hagios Ioannes Studios in Constantinople, a basilica dedicated to John the Baptist, built in 463. The chancel barrier surrounded the altar in a π shape, with one large <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> the nave and two smaller doors on the other sides. Twelve piers held chancel slabs of about 1.6 meters in length. The height of the slabs is not known. The chancel barrier was not merely a low parapet (a short wall); remains of colonnettes have been found, suggesting that the barrier carried an architrave {{on top of the}} columns.|$|E
25|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} from the St. John of Stoudios monastery in Constantinople suggests that the Iconostasis evolved from the early templon. A basilica dedicated to John the Baptist was built in 463 AD. In it the chancel barrier surrounded the altar in a π shape, with one large <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> the nave and two smaller doors on the other sides. Twelve piers held chancel slabs of about 1.6 meters in length. The height of the slabs is not known.

50|$|The {{direction}} that the house's <b>door</b> <b>faces</b> is also said {{to play a}} part in determining the occupants' well-being. The worst direction for the <b>door</b> to <b>face</b> is south, which brings bad career luck. A <b>door</b> which <b>faces</b> the west is said to bring knowledge or encourages the coming of someone well-learned, especially in matters of religion. This is probably a reference to the fact that foreigners, particularly the Indian Muslims who introduced Islam in the region, sailed to the Malay Peninsula from the west. A <b>door</b> that <b>faces</b> east ensures many grandchildren and a life of tranquility. A north-facing door brings wealth.|$|R

500|$|After Fram was {{anchored}} to ice in an inlet in the south-eastern {{corner of the}} Bay, Amundsen selected a site for the expedition's main hut, [...] from the ship. Six teams of dogs were used to move supplies to the site, as work on erecting the hut began. Bjaaland and Stubberud laid the foundations deep into the ice, levelling the sloping ground. Because the prevailing winds came from the east, the hut was erected on an east-west axis, with the <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> west; {{in this way the}} wind caught only the shorter eastern wall. The roof was in place by 21January, and six days later the hut was complete. By then a large supply of meat—including 200seals—had been brought to the base, for use by the shore party and to be laid in depots before the journey to the pole. The base was dubbed Framheim, [...] "the home of Fram".|$|E
2500|$|The {{interior}} of the cabin is partitioned into three rooms. [...] The interior petitions are made of peeled stacked logs with mortar chinking between logs. [...] The front room (office) is at north end of building. The bedroom takes up the southwest quarter and the kitchen is in the southeast quarter. [...] A steel cable connects the two long walls to keep the winter snow load from forcing {{the sides of the}} cabin apart. [...] The floor is covered with [...] tongue-and-groove fir planks. [...] The cabin has three doors: a front <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> west, a back <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> east, and a kitchen <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> south. [...] The office has two casement windows. [...] The bedroom and kitchen each have two horizontal sliding sash windows. [...] The kitchen has built-in knotty pine cupboards and the bedroom has a built-in knotty pine dresser. [...] The bedroom also has a built-in closet with knotty pine doors.

50|$|The alchemy {{laboratory}} {{was called}} the Chamber of Elixirs (danshi 丹室, danwu 丹屋, or danfang 丹房). Sources differ about how to construct one. One text says the Chamber is ideally built near a mountain stream on in a secluded place (compare a clandestine drug lab), and has two <b>doors,</b> <b>facing</b> east and south; another says it should never be built over an old well or tomb, and has <b>doors</b> <b>facing</b> in all directions except north (Pregadio 2000: 188).|$|R

2500|$|One 1996 NABI {{articulated}} bus, 9619 {{was saved}} and converted into MTA's official [...] "Comfort Bus," [...] a bus specially {{designed to be}} dispatched to special events in Baltimore City during the summer to provide air conditioning to the attendees of special events and to be dispatched around the city for displaced city residents whose homes were made uninhabitable by fire or other causes to provide them heat {{in the winter and}} air conditioning in the summer. The interior for 9619 was heavily modified from its revenue service design with three interior roof mounted AC units, modified seating arrangement, tables, a water cooler, microwave, mini-fridge, wall electrical outlets, and a <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> the public-area of the bus prohibiting access from {{going in and out of}} the front door, entrance and exit for the public is only through the rear door. Artscape 2015 was the very first event with very high temperatures that 9619 was deployed to as the official MTA Maryland Comfort Bus and the bus had major problems keeping the interior comfortably air conditioned from the three interior roof mounted AC units that were installed. MTA on July 20, 2015 posted to their Facebook page in a comment to an Artscape 2015 attendee who boarded 9619 and experienced the lack of air conditioning: [...] "We spoke with the HVAC specialists who work on the Comfort Zone Bus and they are aware of and working on the issue. Sorry for the discomfort you experienced. Because the Comfort Zone Bus is a new innovation, sometimes it takes a trial or two to get the bugs worked out. Thanks for letting us know!" ...|$|E

60|$|The book lying open on Heyst's knee slipped {{suddenly}} {{and he made}} a sharp movement to catch it up. Wang was unable to see the reason of this because of the table, and leaped away from what seemed to him a threatening symptom. When Heyst looked up, the Chinaman was already at the <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> the room, not frightened, but alert.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wha--what do you mean?" [...] faltered the girl. And now, {{looking through}} the sitting-room window and through a doorway leading to the kitchen, the Rover boys saw a pretty damsel of sixteen {{standing}} by a pantry <b>door,</b> <b>facing</b> two dudish young men of eighteen or twenty. The young men wore checkered suits and sported heavy watch fobs and diamond rings and scarf-pins.|$|E
60|$|I {{drew back}} into a corner behind the <b>door,</b> <b>facing</b> the gallery stairs, and watched for her. After an {{interval}} {{which seemed to be}} endless, she and her companion appeared, slowly descending the stairs. She wore a long dark cloak; her head was protected by a quaintly shaped hood, which looked (on her) the most becoming head-dress that a woman could wear. As the two passed me, I heard the man speak to her in a tone of sulky annoyance.|$|E
60|$|A pair {{of double}} <b>doors</b> <b>faced</b> {{the top of}} the staircase. This was evidently the grand {{reception}} room and, listening intently, he could hear a murmur of voices inside. Turning the handle and throwing them suddenly open, he entered.|$|R
60|$|Anne {{flew to the}} <b>door,</b> <b>face</b> alight, eyes glowing. On {{the very}} {{threshold}} she stopped short, wheeled about, came back and sat down by the table, light and glow as effectually blotted out as if some one had clapped an extinguisher on her.|$|R
60|$|He bade good-night to Clara, and went. The {{twisting}} {{stairs of}} white, scrubbed wood creaked and clanged at every step. He went doggedly. The two <b>doors</b> <b>faced</b> each other. He went in his room, {{pushed the door}} to, without fastening the latch.|$|R
60|$|Isbel's {{house had}} not been {{constructed}} {{with the idea of}} repelling an attack from a band of Apaches. The long living room of the main cabin was the one selected for defense and protection. This room had two windows and a <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> the lane, and a door at each end, one of which opened into the kitchen and the other into an adjoining and later-built cabin. The logs of this main cabin were of large size, and the doors and window coverings were heavy, affording safer protection from bullets than the other cabins.|$|E
60|$|That angered the man. With {{one long}} stride he {{stepped over the}} doorsill, down into the cabin, and flung the {{blankets}} at her feet and then the pack after it. Whereupon he deliberately {{sat down in the}} <b>door,</b> <b>facing</b> her. With one hand he slid off his sombrero, which fell outside, and with the other he reached in his upper vest pocket for the little bag of tobacco that showed there. All the time he looked at her. By the light now unobstructed Jean descried Colter's face; and sight of it then sounded the roll and drum of his passions.|$|E
60|$|There was a <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> him, {{a door to}} the right, and a door to the left. The officer {{chose to}} enter the room on the left, and ordered the blinds to be pulled up. It was Mr. Nicholas B.'s study, {{with a couple of}} tall bookcases, some {{pictures}} on the walls, and so on. Besides the big centre-table, with books and papers, there was a quite small writing-table, with several drawers, standing between the door and the window in a good light; and at this table my granduncle usually sat either to read or write.|$|E
50|$|Maple Leaf school's {{distinct}} {{features are}} its chimney {{which serves as}} a geographical landmark for the neighborhood.

50|$|The door has toothed lugs {{all around}} its circumference, with the lugs {{lined up with}} {{corresponding}} openings in the locking ring, which turns on the hub. When closed, the <b>door</b> <b>faces</b> the hub and an O-ring gasket provides the means of sealing against internal pressure. As the locking ring turns, it cams the lugs of the door forward, pressing the door against the hub. This way, there is no sliding motion of the <b>door</b> <b>face</b> across the O-ring gasket. Thus, the gasket can be an inexpensive O-ring, replacements for which {{can be made in}} the user's own shop using ordinary O-ring stock, and it lasts a long time. The very few wear parts on the door are replaceable, making the autoclave a long-lived investment.|$|R

60|$|He {{asked again}} {{if there was}} not a way round, if that circle of {{mountains}} had no back door. Shadrach replied that there was such a back <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> to the north some eight days' journey away. Only at this season of the year it could not be reached, since beyond the Mountains of Mur in that direction was a great lake, out of which flowed the river Ebur in two arms that enclosed the whole plain of Fung. By now this lake would be full, swollen with rains that fell on the hills of Northern Africa, and the space between it and the Mur range nothing but an impassable swamp.|$|E
60|$|While {{the servant}} was {{speaking}} the officer looked about the hall. There was a <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> him, {{a door to}} the right and a door to the left. The officer chose to enter the room on the left and ordered the blinds to be pulled up. It was Mr. Nicholas B.'s study with a couple of tall bookcases, some pictures on the walls, and so on.

60|$|In a less {{softened}} mood, {{the first}} thing Mr. Bennett would have done on crossing {{the threshold of the}} <b>door</b> <b>facing</b> the staircase would have been to notice resentfully that Mr. Mortimer, with his usual astuteness, had collared the best bedroom in the house. The soft carpet gave out no sound as Mr. Bennett approached the wide and luxurious bed. The light of the candle fell {{on the back of a}} semi-bald head. Mr. Mortimer was sleeping with his face buried in the pillow. It cannot have been good for him, but that was what he was doing. From the portion of the pillow in which his face was buried strange gurgles proceeded, like the distant rumble of an approaching train on the Underground.|$|E
