40|$|This paper {{describes}} an observer trip on a Japanese freezer longliner {{in the international}} waters of the North East Atlantic {{in the autumn of}} 1997. The observation period was 71 days during which 7 species were recorded as catch and bycatch from 57 sets. Although bluefin tuna was the target species, with 18, 894 kg <b>gilled</b> <b>and</b> <b>gutted</b> weight (GWT) caught, the most frequently retained species was blue shark, Prionace glauca, followed by bluefin tuna. Three shortfin mako shark, Isurus oxyrinchus, one swordfish, Xiphias gladius and one anglerfish, Lophius spp., were also recorded. The most frequently discarded species were lancetfish Alepisaurus ferox, and deal fish Trachipterus arcticus. Bluefin tuna ranged from 139 cm to 275 cm in fork length (FL) and from 64 kg to 347 kg in round weight (RWT) with clear modes of 190 cm and 136 kg. Recent ageing results from the North East Atlantic infer ages of 4 to 17 years old. CPUE was lower than Norwegian sponsored trials in the North East Atlantic in 1998 and similar to those computed by the Japanese longline observer programme in 2000, 2001 and 2002. There was no evidence of trend in bluefin CPUE {{over the course of the}} observation period. The modelled length weight relationship predicted higher values than established length weight relationships for bluefin tuna in the East Atlantic: ICCAT modelled RWT for East Atlantic bluefin was 87 % of the observed round weight and 90 % of the predicted RWT value for Koshin Maru # 8 tuna. Over the observation period the condition of bluefin tuna was found to decline and examination of stomachs showed that most were empty or contained low numbers of prey items. Declining condition factors and apparent scarcity of prey are discussed in the context of CPUE. Prey scarcity reflected in declining condition may increase the effectiveness of baited hooks causing abundance estimates derived from CPUE series to over-estimate the population of bluefin tuna in the North East Atlantic. Investigation of condition indices has the potential to estimate stock ratios in longline catches in the North Atlantic. All observed blue shark catch were female with lengths ranging from 140 cm to 250 cm. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|E
40|$|We stocked phase-III {{sunshine}} bass (white bass Morone chrysops ♀ × {{striped bass}} M. saxatilis ♂) {{at a rate}} of 6, 188 fingerlings/ha into twelve 0. 04 -ha earthen ponds supplied with continuous aeration. Three dietary treatments were randomly assigned to quadruplicate ponds. Sunshine bass were fed to apparent satiation once daily after average initial weight (mean ± SE = 214 ± 5 g) and total length (245 ± 1. 6 mm) were determined. Diets were formulated to conserve the estimated digestible energy:crude protein (CP) ratio (9. 3 kcal/g protein) and represented the following CP and energy values fed to fish: 32 % CP (3, 000 kcal/kg), 36 % CP (3, 360 kcal/kg), and 40 % CP (3, 760 kcal/kg). Harvest data suggest that nutrient density is a variable that can be manipulated to optimize production and reduce production costs. Production rates (mean ± SE) were 2, 851 ± 600 kg/ha for the 32 %-CP diet, 2, 895 ± 341 kg/ha for the 36 %-CP diet, and 2, 953 ± 142 kg/ha for the 40 %-CP diet; production rates were not significantly different among dietary treatments. Survival was excellent and {{did not appear to be}} related to dietary treatment. Dressed (<b>gilled</b> <b>and</b> <b>gutted)</b> fish averaged 80 % of whole-fish weight, and the dressed percentage did not vary as a function of nutrient density. Feed conversion ratios of 3. 0 ± 0. 4, 2. 8 ± 0. 2, and 2. 6 ± 0. 1 were obtained for the fish fed 32 -, 36 -, and 40 %-CP diets, respectively. Protein conversion ratios (mean = 1. 0) were not significantly influenced by dietary treatment. Feed cost increased with increasing dietary CP level; costs were US$ 0. 447 per kilogram for the 32 %-CP diet, $ 0. 493 per kilogram for the 36 %-CP diet, and $ 0. 541 per kilogram for the 40 %-CP diet. The resulting production costs attributable to feed were $ 1. 34, $ 1. 38, and $ 1. 41 per kilogram of gain for the 32 -, 36 -, and 40 %-CP diets, respectively. A savings of $ 0. 16 per kilogram produced, or approximately $ 450 per hectare, was realized as a result of feeding either of the two lower-CP, lower-energy diets. Accordingly, we suggest that phase-III sunshine bass can be more economically produced by feeding diets as low as 32 % CP with a minimum energy:protein ratio of 9. 3 kcal/g CP...|$|E

The aim {{of the present study}} was to identify the bacterial microflora of skin, <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> of roach caught in river. Altogether, nine roach (Rutilus rutilus) samples were collected from fishermen from Driksna river in Latvia. Skin, <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> samples were investigated for total bacterial count (TBC), coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae. Pooled skin, muscles and internal organ samples were examined for presence of pathogens – Salmonella spp., Listeria spp. and Yersinia spp. in accordance with ISO standards. Identification of bacterial species was performed with MALDI-TOF MS Biotyper. TBC ranged from 1. 96 to 5. 16 log 10 CFU g- 1, coliforms from 0 to 3. 66 log 10 CFU g- 1 and Enterobacteriaceae from 0 to 4. 16 log 10 CFU g- 1 in roach skin, <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> samples. The highest counts of TBC, coliforms and Enterobacteriaceae was found in roach <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> samples, while there were no significant differences between the TBC in skin, <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> (p< 0. 05). Rahnella spp. and Pseudomonas spp.  were the dominant bacteria identified in fish skin, <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut.</b> These microorganisms promote the development of deterioration processes of fish meat, and also can be associated with human infections.

Fourteen phyla were detected in the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> communities, of which 11 phyla were shared by both tissues.

Mean cadmium (Cd) concentrations from tissues studied are within permissible amounts (0. 02 - 0. 05 mg L- 1); mean lead (Pb) concentrations from the muscles, <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> were within permissible amounts except for the liver (0. 22 mg L- 1).

40|$|Chemokine and {{chemokine}} receptor signalling pairs play {{a crucial}} role in regulation of cell migration, morphogenesis, and cell activation. Expressed in mammals on activated T and NK cells, chemokine receptor CXCR 3 binds interferon-¿ inducible chemokines CXCL 9 – 11 and CCL 21. Here we sequenced the carp CXCR 3 chemokine receptor and showed its relationship to CXCR 3 a receptors found in other teleosts. We found high expression of the CXCR 3 gene in most of the organs and tissues of the immune system and in immune-related tissues such as <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut,</b> corroborating a predominantly immune-related function. The very high expression in <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> moreover indicates a role for CXCR 3 in cell recruitment during infection. High in vivo expression of CXCR 3 at later stages of inflammation, as well as its in vitro sensitivity to IFN-¿ 2 stimulation indicate that in carp, CXCR 3 is involved in macrophage-mediated responses. Moreover, as expression of the CXCR 3 and CXCb genes coincides in the focus of inflammation and as both the CXCb chemokines and the CXCR 3 receptor are significantly up-regulated upon IFN-¿ stimulation it is hypothesized that CXCb chemokines may be putative ligands for CXCR 3...|$|R
40|$|Yersinia ruckeri is the causative {{agent of}} {{yersiniosis}} or {{enteric redmouth disease}} (ERM) and causes significant losses in salmonid aquaculture worldwide. Although infection with this agent {{has been reported in}} other fish species, salmonids and especially rainbow trout are most susceptible to ERM. Vaccination of fish with a commercial Y. ruckeri bacterin provides good levels of protection, however, disease outbreaks do occur from time to time. The understanding of how this pathogen causes disease is crucial in order to develop new preventive and therapeutic approaches. The aim of this thesis was to study the early pathogenesis of Y. ruckeri infections, with emphasis on the identification of the portal of entry and the investigation of different traits in vitro that have been associated with bacterial virulence. The General Introduction gives an overview of the micro-organism, Y. ruckeri, and the disease it causes. From this review it is clear that only little information is available about the pathogenesis of Y. ruckeri. Only recently, the mechanisms by which the pathogen causes disease have started to be unravelled. In the first experimental study, the portal of entry of Y. ruckeri and its tissue distribution at different time intervals were investigated using an immersion infection model in rainbow trout. This model strongly mimics the natural way of infection and therefore, is suitable to study infectious diseases in fish. Additional experimental infections were carried out to determine whether a different tissue distribution is related to differences in virulence. Bacteriological and histological examination revealed the presence of high numbers of bacteria in the gills immediately after infection. Many Y. ruckeri were found to be attached to the <b>gill</b> mucus <b>and</b> some were detected within the gill capillaries between 0 and 2. 5 h post infection (p. i.). This indicates that bacteria first adhere to <b>gill</b> mucus <b>and</b> thereafter invade the branchial vasculature leading to colonization of the internal organs. These findings show that the gills are an important portal of entry. Nevertheless, only a virulent strain was able to survive and multiply in the host, causing septicaemia and death several days after infection whereas exposure to avirulent strains resulted in a complete removal of bacteria from the internal organs. This could indicate that immune evasion is a major virulence property of Y. ruckeri. In the second experimental study, the early interactions of virulent and avirulent Y. ruckeri strains with the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> tissue of rainbow trout were determined using a standardized <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> perfusion model. For this purpose, perfused <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> explants were inoculated for 1 h with Y. ruckeri and thereafter, processed for bacteriological, histological and immunohistochemical examination for demonstration of bacterial adherence. For the first time, both perfusion models were also used to study bacterial invasion. Therefore, the perfusion fluid at the efferent gill arch during <b>gill</b> perfusion <b>and</b> the organ bath fluid following gut perfusion were examined bacteriologically. A non-invasive Escherichia coli strain was included as negative control for invasion. In both the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> perfusion models, virulent and avirulent Y. ruckeri strains highly adhered to <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> tissue <b>and</b> significant differences were not observed. Bacteria were seen in the mucus, associated with the epithelium and invaded in the lamina propria of the gills. Y. ruckeri was also observed in the crypts, attached to the villi and within the epithelial layer of the gut. Few bacteria were also detected in the intestinal lamina propria mucosae. Our results showed that virulent and avirulent Y. ruckeri invaded the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> whereas a non-invasive E. coli strain was not isolated from the perfusion fluid and organ bath fluid in the <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> perfusion model, respectively. These findings indicate that Y. ruckeri is able to colonize <b>and</b> invade the <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> intestine of rainbow trout. Significant differences in adherence and invasive capacity were not observed between virulent and avirulent strains. In the third experimental study, different traits that have been associated with bacterial virulence were compared between virulent and avirulent Y. ruckeri strains, including adhesion to mucus and cell lines, invasion and intracellular survival in cell lines and serum resistance. The adhesion and invasion mechanisms were further characterized for selected Y. ruckeri strains. The virulent isolates highly adhered to isolated <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> mucus of rainbow trout, whereas the majority of the avirulent strains demonstrated significantly lower adhesion. A decrease in adherence capability following bacterial treatment with sodium metaperiodate and proteolytic enzymes suggested that carbohydrates as well as proteins play a role and consequently, lectins may be involved in the adhesion. All Y. ruckeri strains were able to adhere to and invade CHSE- 214, FHM and R 1 cells. One avirulent strain showed high adherence and invasive capacity in the three cell lines, whereas the virulent strains were moderately adhesive and invasive. The internalization of several isolates was inhibited by colchicine and cytochalasin-D, suggesting the involvement of microtubules and microfilaments. Monodansylcadaverine never inhibited Y. ruckeri internalization and therefore, the formation of clathrin-coated pits in receptor-mediated endocytosis may not play a role. For all strains, intracellular survival assays showed a decrease of viable bacteria in the cells 6 h after inoculation. This suggests that Y. ruckeri is not able to multiply or survive inside cultured cells or remains intracellularly for only a short period. Analysis of the susceptibility to the bactericidal effect of rainbow trout serum demonstrated that virulent strains were serum resistant, whereas avirulent strains were generally serum sensitive. Taken together, adherence to mucus and resistance to the bactericidal effect of serum seems to be correlated with in vivo virulence. In the General Discussion, the results of the three experimental studies are discussed and hypothetical virulence mechanisms are proposed in relation to the known virulence factors of Y. ruckeri. Finally, perspectives are given on how these findings may contribute to the prevention of ERM. In conclusion, the <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> were identified as possible important portals of entry for Y. ruckeri in rainbow trout. This pathogen is shown to be able to adhere to and invade in non-phagocytic cells. The adherence of the pathogen seems to involve bacterial lectins that bind specific carbohydrate structures on host surfaces. Invasion appears to be a microtubule and microfilament dependent process. Virulence of Y. ruckeri isolates is probably a complex combination of adhesion and colonization capacity, resistance to the bactericidal effect of serum and other factors which still needs to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Epithelial {{cells of}} the gut, antennal glands, integument, <b>and</b> <b>gills</b> of {{crustaceans}} regulate the movements of ions into and across these structures and thereby influence the concentrations of ions in the hemolymph. Specific transport proteins serving cations and anions are found on apical and basolateral cell membranes of epithelia in these tissues. In recent years, a considerable research effort has been directed at elucidating their physiological and molecular properties and relating these characteristics to the overall biology of the organisms.

Results showed that the greatest histopathological damages appeared when the salinity values decreased.

In this study, Zn accumulations in different tissues (<b>gills,</b> liver, muscle, <b>and</b> <b>gut)</b> of goldfish (Carassius auratus) after exposure to ZnO NPs were studied in comparison with bulk ZnO and Zn 2 +. And the technique of subcellular partitioning was firstly used on the liver of goldfish to study the hepatic accumulation of ZnO NPs. The results showed that at sublethal Zn concentration (2 mg/L), bioaccumulation in goldfish was tissue-specific and dependent on the exposure materials. Compared with Zn 2 +, the particles of bulk ZnO and the ZnO NPs appeared to aggregate in the environmentally contacted tissues (<b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut),</b> rather than transport to the internal tissues (liver and muscle).

40|$|In {{recent years}} our {{understanding}} of the control of ion and urea metabolism in elasmobranch fish has increased with many more species being investigated. This has demonstrated that some species regarded previously as stenohaline marine are, at least partially, euryhaline and may survive in environments less concentrated than full seawater. In elasmobranch fish the success of the osmotic strategy depends on retaining large concentrations of plasma urea in addition to relatively high, in comparison to most other vertebrates, plasma concentrations of sodium and chloride. The strategy therefore depends on the integrated control of hepatic urea production and branchial and renal urea excretion and also on a balance of salt input at the <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> with salt output at the <b>gills,</b> kidney <b>and</b> via the unique elasmobranch rectal gland. This integrated response is, at least in part, controlled by a series of osmoregulatory hormones and their possible role in the control of osmoregulatory organs will be discussed.

To do this, the levels of total immunoglobulin M, several enzymes and proteins (peroxidase, lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase, esterases, proteases and antiproteases), as well as the bactericidal activity against opportunist fish pathogens (Vibrio harveyi, Vibrio angillarum, Photobacterium damselae) and non-pathogenic bacteria (Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis) were measured in the skin mucus and compared with those found in the serum. This study demonstrates that gilthead seabream skin mucus contains lower levels of IgM, similar levels of lysozyme, alkaline phosphatase and proteases, and higher esterase, peroxidase and antiprotease activities than serum. In addition, skin mucus revealed stronger bactericidal activity against tested fish pathogen bacteria compared to the serum activity, while human bacteria can even grow more in the presence of mucus.

Here, we assess the relative importance of microbiota in different tissues of Pacific oyster for its successful establishment in a new environment. We transplanted oysters from the Southern to the Northern Wadden Sea and controlled for the effects of resident microbiota by administering antibiotics to half of the oysters. We then followed survival and composition of haemolymph, mantle, <b>gill</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> microbiota in local and translocated oysters over 5 days. High mortality was recorded only in non-antibiotic-treated translocated oysters, where high titres of active Vibrio sp. in solid tissues indicated systemic infections. Network analyses revealed the highest connectivity and a link to seawater communities in the haemolymph microbiota. Since antibiotics decreased modularity and increased connectivity of the haemolymph-based networks, we propose that community destabilization in non-treated translocated oysters could be attributed to interactions between resident and external microbiota, which in turn facilitated passage of vibrios into solid tissues and invoked disease. These interactions of haemolymph microbiota with the external and internal environment may thus represent an important component of oyster fitness...|$|R

The expression of Toll protein gene was studied in healthy and experimentally exposed (Vibrio harveyi) Penaeus monodon (tiger shrimp) by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using self-designed Toll-specific PCR primers. Comparison of the expression profiles of Toll protein gene in <b>gills,</b> hepatopancreas <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> of P. monodon showed that experimental exposure to a gram-negative bacterial pathogen, Vibrio harveyi induces Toll protein gene expression in these organs.

40|$|AbstractFish {{contamination}} {{has been}} extensively investigated along the Saudi coasts, but studies pertaining to bacterial pathogens are scarce. We conducted qualitative assessment and molecular identification of culture-dependent bacteria in 13 fish species from three coastal sites and a local fish market in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. Bacterial counts of <b>gills,</b> skin, <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> muscle were examined on agar plates of Macconkey’s (Mac), Eosin Methylene Blue (EMB) and Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts (TCBS) culture media. Bacterial counts significantly differed between species, sources and feeding habits of examined fishes. Mugil cephalus exhibited higher counts on TCBS (all body parts), Mac (<b>gills,</b> muscle <b>and</b> <b>gut)</b> <b>and</b> EMB (<b>gills</b> <b>and</b> muscle). Fishes from Area I had higher bacterial loads, coinciding with those in seawater and sediment from the same site, indicating direct association between habitat conditions and the levels of bacterial contamination. By feeding habit, detritivorous fish harbored higher counts than herbivorous and carnivorous species. Bacterial counts of skin were higher in fish from market than field sites, and positively correlated with other body parts indicating the relation of surface bacterial load on {{the overall quality of}} fish. Rahnella aquatilis (Enterobacteriaceae) and Photobacterium damselae (Vibrionaceae) were among the dominant species from fish muscle based on 16 S rRNA sequencing. These species are known human pathogens capable of causing foodborne illness with severe antibiotic resistance. Opportunistic pathogens, e. g. Hafnia sp. (Enterobacteriaceae) and Pseudomonas stutzeri (Pseudomonadaceae) also occurred in fish muscle. The inclusion of bacterial contamination in future monitoring efforts is thus crucial...|$|R

To better understand the epidemiology and ecology of the bacterium, we carried out a surveillance study to investigate possible seasonal variation in the recovery of L. hongkongensis and its distribution in various organs in retail freshwater fish in Hong Kong. Forty whole freshwater fish of two species (20 grass carps and 20 bighead carps), and intestines from 120 grass carps were sampled during a one-year period. L. hongkongensis was isolated from 11 (55 %) of the 20 grass carps and 6 (30 %) of the 20 bighead carps; and the intestines of 49 (41 %) of 120 grass carps. Seasonal variation in the recovery of L. hongkongensis from both whole fish and intestines was observed, with higher isolation rates in spring and summer than in fall and winter. There was also positive correlation between temperature and the isolation rates. When L. hongkongensis was cultured in vitro at different temperatures, shorter lag time and higher growth rate were observed at higher temperatures, with 37  °C being optimal among the tested temperatures. L. hongkongensis was commonly found in the <b>gills,</b> stomachs <b>and</b> intestines in both grass carps and bighead carps, and on the skin surface of one fish, but not in other organs. Proper handling of freshwater fish for cooking, especially the <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut,</b> is recommended to prevent acquisition of L. hongkongensis, and other freshwater fish related infections. © 2006 Elsevier B.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hydrothermal}} Pompeii worm Alvinella pompejana lives {{very close}} to the walls of black smokers and is therefore exposed to high-temperature venting fluid containing high concentrations of sulphides and metals. The highly aerobic metabolism of these annelids, together with these extreme physico-chemical conditions, theoretically accelerates redox processes in and around the worm, potentially increasing oxidative threat by reactive oxygen species (ROS). This prompted us to analyse activity of antioxidant enzymes in A. pompejana tissues and investigate whether they are adjusted to the endogenous production of ROS by oxidative phosphorylations and/or to the environmental conditions. This was investigated by comparing antioxidant and metabolic enzyme activities in gills, head, body wall, pygidium <b>and</b> <b>guts</b> of A. pompejana collected at different vent sites of the East Pacific Rise. The antioxidant defence arsenal of A. pompejana is peculiar, showing very low catalase (CAT) activity and very high superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity in most tissues. It is very likely that CAT is not expressed in A. pompejana, as this haemic enzyme could be inhibited by the high sulphide concentrations prevailing in the worm's environment. A. pompejana does not compensate for the low hydrogen peroxide scavenging activity of CAT by higher glutathione peroxidase (GPX) activity levels. This latter enzyme correlates well with cytochrome c oxidase and citrate synthase in most tissues, suggesting that oxidative metabolism represents the main source of peroxides managed by GPX. On the contrary, SOD shows no correlation with any metabolic enzyme and is likely adjusted to respiration-independent ROS generation. Source variations in enzyme activities are mainly observed in the animal's <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut,</b> possibly reflecting differences in the vent fluid thermal regime and/or chemistry...|$|R
40|$|Background Studies of oyster microbiomes have {{revealed}} that {{a limited number of}} microbes, including pathogens, can dominate microbial communities in host tissues such as <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut.</b> Much of the bacterial diversity however remains underexplored and unexplained, although environmental conditions and host genetics have been implicated. We used 454 next generation 16 S rRNA amplicon sequencing of individually tagged PCR reactions to explore the diversity of bacterial communities in gill tissue of the invasive Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas stemming from genetically differentiated beds under ambient outdoor conditions and after a multifaceted disturbance treatment imposing stress on the host. Results While the gill associated microbial communities in oysters were dominated by few abundant taxa (i. e. Sphingomonas, Mycoplasma) the distribution of rare bacterial groups correlated to relatedness between the hosts under ambient conditions. Exposing the host to disturbance broke apart this relationship by removing rare phylotypes thereby reducing overall microbial diversity. Shifts in the microbiome composition in response to stress did not result in a net increase in genera known to contain potentially pathogenic strains. Conclusion The decrease in microbial diversity and the disassociation between population genetic structure of the hosts and their associated microbiome suggest that disturbance (i. e. stress) may play a significant role for the assembly of the natural microbiome. Such community shifts may in turn also feed back on the course of disease and the occurrence of mass mortality events in oyster populations...|$|R
40|$|Fish {{contaminations}} {{have been}} extensively investigated in Saudi coasts, but studies pertaining to bacterial pathogens are meager. We conducted qualitative assessment and molecular identification of culture dependent bacteria in 13 fish species collected from three fishing sites {{and a local}} fish market in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The bacterial counts of <b>gills,</b> skin, <b>gut</b> <b>and</b> muscle were examined on agar plates of Macconkey’s (Mac), Eosin methylene blue (EMB) and Thiosulfate Citrate Bile Salts (TCBS) culture media. Bacterial counts exhibited interspecific, locational and behavioral differences. Mugil cephalus exhibited higher counts on TCBS (all body-parts), Mac (<b>gills,</b> muscle <b>and</b> <b>gut)</b> <b>and</b> EMB (<b>gills</b> <b>and</b> muscle). Samples of Area I were with higher counts, concurrent to seawater and sediment samples, revealing the influence of residing environment on fish contamination. Among feeding habits, detritivorous fish harbored higher bacterial counts, while carnivorous group accounted for lesser counts. Counts were higher in skin of fish obtained from market compared to field samples, revealing market as {{a major source of}} contamination. Bacterial counts of skin were positively correlated with other body-parts indicating influence of surface bacterial biota in overall quality of fish. Hence, hygienic practices and proper storage facilities in the Jeddah fish market is recommended to prevent adverse effect of food-borne illness in consumers. Rahnella aquatilis (Enterobacteriaceae) and Photobacterium damselae (Vibrionaceae) were among the dominant species identified from fish muscle samples using Sanger sequencing of 16 S rRNA. This bacterial species are established human pathogens capable of causing foodborne illness with severe antibiotic resistance. Opportunistic pathogens such as Hafnia sp. (Enterobacteriaceae) and Pseudomonas stutzeri (Pseudomonadaceae) were also identified from fish muscle. These findings indicate bacterial contamination risk in commonly consumed fish of Jeddah region...|$|R
40|$|Water {{contamination}} by metal compounds is {{a worldwide}} environmental problem. Fish accumulate metals in higher concentrations in their tissues by environmental absorption by the <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut.</b> The present report {{is an attempt}} to investigate the influence of cadmium exposure on the accumulation of this metal in zebrafish brain and the correlative expression of GAFP marker for the glial cells, the first of the brain parenchyma to encounter metals crossing the blood-brain barrier. Cadmium accumulation in brain was measured by APAT IRSA-CNR method, 3000 Section 3010 division. GAFP immunoreactivity was determined by ABC technique. 18 adult fish were exposed to contaminated water (1. 0 mg/L of CdCl 2). Groups of 6 fish were killed after 2, 7 and 16 days. Another 18 fish were kept in uncontaminated water as control animals. We reveled that cadmium accumulation increased over time; cadmium concentration in treated fish brain appeared to increase exponentially and it was maximum after 16 days (2 days after: 22. 23 ppm ± 1. 0; 7 days: 33. 16 ppm ± 0. 82; 16 days: 45. 04 ppm ± 1. 02). Immunohistochemical detection of GFAP structures revealed a considerable decrease of the immunoreactive structures during the treatment. In particular, we observed this reduction of GFAP immunoreactivity {{in the area of the}} optic tectum, medulla and cerebellum. Our data following treatment with cadmium indicate that a correlation exists between decrement of GFAP expression and cadmium accumulation found in the brain. Maybe cadmium crosses the blood-brain-barrier and it accumulates in the brain, in particular in glial cells...|$|R
40|$|Nanotechnology {{is rapidly}} growing with {{nanoparticles}} produced and utilized {{in a wide}} range of commercial products worldwide. Among the different types of nanomaterials produced, silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) occupy a predominant position and they are used in electronics, clothing, food industry, cosmetics and medical devices. Nanosilver has also showed excellent performance in antibacterial application. Nowadays, the increasing use of AgNPs has put the evidence on their possible toxicity to the human health and the impact on the environment. This paper focus on adverse effects of AgNPs in adult of Danio rerio. Fishes exposed to increasing concentrations (8, 45, and 70 μg/l) silver nanoparticles (AgNPs, 25 nm in average diameter) and after treatment for 30 days, was quickly euthanized in MS- 222. We have evaluated bioaccumulation of AgNPs using ICP-MS and analyzed histological changes, biomarkers of oxidative damage and gene expression in the <b>gut,</b> liver <b>and</b> <b>gills</b> tissues of AgNPs-treated zebrafish. The histological analysis showed lesions of secondary lamellae of the gills with different degrees of toxicity such as hyperplasia, lamellar fusion, subepithelial edema, and even in some cases telangiectasia. Huge necrosis of the intestinal villi was found in the gut. No lesion was detected in the liver. The analysis revealed a high expression of metallothioneins 1 (MTs 1) in animals exposed to AgNPs compared to the control group. The ICP-MS analysis shows that the amount of particles absorbed in all treated samples is almost the same. We can affirm that AgNPs toxicity linked more to their size and state of aggregation than to their concentrations. Silver nanoparticles can damage <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut</b> because they are able to pass through the mucosal barrier thanks to their small size. The damage is still reversible because it is not documented injury to the basal membrane...|$|R
40|$|Much {{remains to}} be {{understood}} about systemic regulation of zinc uptake in vertebrates, and adequate zinc status is far from always achieved in animals or human. In addition to absorbing zinc from the diet, fish are able to take up zinc directly from the water with the gills. This provides an elegant system to study zinc uptake, how it relates to zinc status, and the expression of genes for proteins involved in zinc acquisition. A 21 -day experiment was conducted in which zebrafish were acclimated to deficient, control or excess zinc concentrations {{in the water and}} feed. Deficient provision of zinc reduced whole body zinc, potassium, sodium and calcium levels whilst zinc concentrations in the uptake epithelia (<b>gills</b> <b>and</b> <b>gut)</b> remained unchanged. Excess levels of zinc caused accumulation of zinc in the <b>gills,</b> intestine <b>and</b> carcass, but impaired whole body iron, sodium and calcium concentrations. Fish subjected to zinc deficiency had, surprisingly, a reduced zinc influx across the gill epithelium, even when tested at a high concentration of zinc in the water. Zinc influx in the excess group was indistinct from the control. Expression of genes for metallothionein- 2 (Mt 2) and zinc transporters- 1, - 2, and - 8 (Znt 1, Znt 2, Znt 8) in uptake epithelia showed in general a direct relationship with zinc supply, while mRNA for Zip 4 was inversely related to zinc supply. Transcripts for the epithelial calcium channel (Ecac/Trpv 6) showed time-dependent increased expression in the gills of the deficiency group, and a transient decrease of expression during zinc excess. Transcriptome profiling by microarrays showed that in both <b>gills</b> <b>and</b> intestine, the most markedly affected biological functions were those related to cell growth, proliferation and cancer, closely followed by processes of gene transcription and protein synthesis in general. Whilst changes in zinc supply had profound effects in the intestine on genes associated with uptake and metabolism of macronutrients, many of the unique categories of genes preferentially regulated in the gill could be mapped onto signalling pathways. This included pathways for PPAR/RXR, LXR/RXR, ATM, chemokine, and BMP signalling. Overall, the responses of epithelial tissue to zinc deficiency and excess are best explained by local epithelial homeostasis with no evidence of systemic control...|$|R

Fungal adhesion towards hemocytes and primary cultures of various white shrimp (Litopeneaus vannamei) tissues (<b>gill,</b> tegument, <b>and</b> <b>gut)</b> was analyzed to determine infectivity. Extracellular protease, lipase, and amylase activity were evaluated as virulence factors. Survival of shrimp post-larvae (PL 8) exposed to fungal culture supernatant or to their filaments was also investigated. The results showed that shrimp tegument cells and hemocytes were very susceptible to Geotrichum spp. invasion, and that this fungus provokes great mortality of post-larvae. Hence, Geotrichum spp. could be considered an opportunistic pathogen that might represent a serious health risk to shrimp in culture...|$|R
