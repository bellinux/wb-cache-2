50|$|Due to {{a declining}} {{population}} caused {{in part by}} over-fishing, climate change, and ocean acidification, {{the current status of}} the <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguin</b> is threatened. Historically it was the victim of guano over-exploitation. Penguins are also declining in numbers due to habitat destruction including by invasive species. The current population is estimated at between 3,300 and 12,000. In August 2010 the <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguin</b> of Chile and Peru, was granted protection under the U.S. Endangered Species Act.|$|R

40|$|This report {{offers a}} {{macroscopic}} and histological description of ulcerative gastric lesions in <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguins</b> {{associated with the}} presence of Contracaecum pelagicum. Parasites of this genus have been isolated from different species of marine mammals and birds, including penguins, demonstrating its capacity to generate ulcerative lesions in the gastrointestinal tracts of many hosts. A bibliographic review revealed no publications on gastric ulceration by nematodes in <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguins.</b> Studies carried out in Chile concerning gastrointestinal parasitism by nematodes of the Contracaecum genus in S. humboldti only established the parasite's taxonomy. This is the first pathological description of a parasitic ulcerative manifestation in the stomach of S. humboldti in the world. The <b>Humboldt</b> <b>penguin</b> is a vulnerable species. Therefore, this study is relevant as it offers {{a better understanding of the}} diseases that affect S. humboldti and facilitates the development of strategies intended to recover the population...|$|R
