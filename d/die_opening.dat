40|$|Usage of {{high-strength}} steels {{with limited}} bendability in conventional air bending is not obvious {{due to the}} deformation limits of these materials. An attractive solution for deformation reduction is the utilization of large radius punches. The bending process for large radius tooling is dissimilar to conventional air bending, due {{to the presence of}} the multi-breakage phenomenon. This phenomenon has been observed by many researchers, but understanding of the influencing parameters is limited. Multi-breakage poses a serious obstacle, since it changes the loading scheme from the typical three-point to four-point bending. In this contribution, an extensive experimental exploration of large radius bending leads to conclusions on the influence of tool dimensions and material characteristics. Air bending experiments have been performed for five materials, four thicknesses, four punch radii, and four <b>die</b> <b>openings.</b> Based on the observed force measurements, the process can be defined as large radius bending when the ratio punch radius/die opening is larger than 1 : 4. Trends for the influencing parameters of the measured data can be used for further investigation of large radius air bending. status: publishe...|$|R
5000|$|Fine {{blanking}} presses {{are similar}} to other metal stamping presses, {{but they have a}} few critical additional parts. A typical compound fine blanking press includes a hardened die punch (male), the hardened blanking die (female), and a guide plate of similar shape/size to the blanking die. The guide plate is the first applied to the material, impinging the material with a sharp protrusion or stinger {{around the perimeter of the}} <b>die</b> <b>opening.</b> Next a counter pressure is applied opposite the punch, and finally the die punch forces the material through the <b>die</b> <b>opening.</b> Since the guide plate holds the material so tightly, and since the counter pressure is applied, the material is cut in a manner more like extrusion than typical punching. Mechanical properties of the cut benefit similarly with a hardened layer at the cut edge of the part. [...] Because the material is so tightly held and controlled in this setup, part flatness remains very true, distortion is nearly eliminated, and edge burr is minimal. Clearances between the die and punch are generally around 1% of the cut material thickness, which typically varies between 0.5 - 13 mm. Currently parts as thick as 19 mm can be cut using fine blanking. Tolerances between ±0.0003 - 0.002 in are possible, depending on base material thickness and tensile strength, and part layout.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Temperature effect due {{to varying}} <b>die</b> <b>opening</b> shapes in the direct {{extrusion}} of lead have been numerically simulated and presented. Using upper bound {{method of analysis}} the internal heat generation due to plastic deformation and frictional heat at various stages of the extrusion process for different <b>die</b> <b>opening</b> geometry are simulated. A C++ program simulates the deformation and frictional power at die land region which is converted to temperature change using finite difference program. At the extrusion die land region, temperature rises with increasing complexity of die openings geometry with I-shaped section, giving the highest temperature rise, followed by T-shaped section, rectangular, circular shaped die openings with square section <b>die</b> <b>opening,</b> giving the least temperature rise for any given extrusion parameter. The die land zone shows increasing temperature rise with increasing friction coefficient, while increasing friction coefficient has no overall effect on the dead metal zone temperature rise. The proper choice of die land is, therefore, imperative if excessive generation of heat at the emergent section is to be avoided to maintain good quality and metallurgical structure of the product...|$|E

Though he began to govern as king on that date, he was not {{immediately}} consecrated as king; he was acclaimed only on , with grand festivities. Meanwhile, several political matters came to the fore. The ambitious Queen Carlota Joaquina had begun to conspire against Portuguese interests while still in Europe, and shortly after her arrival in Brazil, she established understandings with both Spaniards and with nationalists of the Río de la Plata region (now Argentina and Uruguay) to try to secure a monarchy of her own, perhaps as a regent of Spain, perhaps as queen of a new monarchy created from Spanish colonies in South America, perhaps by deposing her husband. This made any meaningful marriage to John impossible, despite his show of patience, and only the force of convention had them appear together in public. While Dona Carlota gained many sympathizers, her plots uniformly failed. Despite that, she managed to influence her husband to involve himself more directly in Spanish colonial politics. These efforts led to the capture of Montevideo in 1817 and the annexation of Cisplatina Province in 1821.|$|R

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the global {{biofuels}} industry has experienced exponential growth. By-products such as {{distillers dried grains}} with solubles (DDGS) have grown in parallel. DDGS is primarily an animal feed, {{but it has also}} been shown to be suitable as a biopolymer. In this study, the extrusion processing behaviour of DDGS was evaluated. Prior to processing, water was added to DDGS at a level of 3 kg DDGS to 1. 5 kg water (water at 50 parts per hundred (pph)). Additionally, a DDGS/water blend with 50 pph CaCO₃ was used as a tracer to determine residence time during processing. The blends were processed in a single screw autogenous extruder, which relied solely upon friction for dissipative heating. Two die plates were used: one consisted of 6 orifices equally spaced, 2 mm diameter each, with a total opening area of 18. 85 mm²; the other consisted of multiple orifices (960 in total) arranged concentrically around the plate, with a diameter of 2. 30 mm each, for a total opening area of 3988. 45 mm². Processing began with DDGS blends without tracer; after reaching steady state, the tracer blend was introduced. Samples were collected every 5 sec during processing to determine extrudate changes over time. Extruder power consumption, mass flow rate, and temperature profile were determined during processing. Extrudates were analysed for Hunter colour (L-a-b) changes over time. Extrusion processing characteristics were highly influenced by the <b>die</b> <b>opening</b> area. Die exit temperatures ranged from room temperature (25 °C) to more than 100 °C, purely due to increased friction for the smaller <b>die</b> <b>opening.</b> Future work should characterize the mechanical properties of these extrudates to assess their suitability as either bioplastic feedstocks or pelletized animal feeds...|$|E

The experiments showed significant increases in forming load and visual pattern change was observed on the formed strip surfaces. This indicates that the tool-strip interaction is playing the dominant role in the increase in forming load observed. FE simulation was undertaken to analyse the details of forming operation and to determine mechanisms behind the increased forming load. It was found that the stresses were greater once the strip started to flow out through the tool <b>die</b> <b>opening</b> that required high forming loads.
