5|$|Most {{pterosaur}} skulls had elongated jaws with a {{full complement}} of needle-like teeth. In some cases, fossilized keratinous beak tissue has been preserved, though in toothed forms, the beak <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> restricted to the jaw tips and does not involve the teeth. Some advanced beaked forms were toothless, such as the pteranodonts and azhdarchids, and had larger, more extensive, and more bird-like beaks.|$|E
5|$|Shoe polish is {{traditionally}} packaged in flat, round, 60-gram (2-ounce) tins, usually with an easy-open facility. Because {{the amount of}} shoe polish {{that needs to be}} applied <b>is</b> <b>small,</b> <b>and</b> the shoe polish will desiccate due to volatile ingredients, such as naphtha, a large container would dry out before being fully used. The traditional flat, round tins have since become synonymous with shoe polishes.|$|E

5|$|The {{biological}} {{interest is}} focused on the species-rich mesotrophic grassland found across the site, which is actively maintained by grazing. The species present are predominantly grasses, although herbs and orchids are also found. The area has been classified as MG5 under the British National Vegetation Classification because of the species composition. The site <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> isolated, and therefore requires careful management to avoid damage caused by activity on neighbouring land.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{development}} within the main canyon, although the El Toro Creek area is primarily residential. There is also some {{residential and commercial}} development downstream of State Route 73.

5|$|All colors {{other than}} Appaloosa are allowed for registration. Welara Sport Ponies {{may be of}} any color or size, without the {{restrictions}} of the purebred Welara. The mix of Arabian and Welsh blood gives the breed refinement, spirit and hardiness, as well as good movement. The head <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> slightly , the neck is arched (and prone to be cresty in stallions). The shoulders and croup are long and the back short. Welaras are used mainly in English riding, especially in hunter classes. They are also seen in show jumping, three-day eventing, pleasure driving and as general leisure riding horses. Welara/Thoroughbred crosses are popular mounts for riders competing in hunter and jumper classes.|$|E

5|$|Aonchotheca forresteri is a {{parasitic}} nematode that infects {{the marsh}} rice rat (Oryzomys palustris) in Florida. Occurring mainly in adults, it inhabits the stomach. It {{is much more}} common during the wet season, perhaps because its unknown intermediate host is an earthworm that only emerges when it rains. The worm was discovered in 1970 and formally described in 1987. Originally classified in the genus Capillaria, it was reclassified in Aonchotheca in 1999. A.forresteri <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> narrow-bodied, with a length of 13.8 to 19.4mm in females and 6.8 to 9.2mm in males. Similar species such as A.putorii differ in features of the alae and spicule (organs in the male), {{the size of the}} female, and the texture of the eggs.|$|E

5|$|Controversy arose {{regarding}} the artwork {{for the cover}} for the Classics VHS cassette when the film was first released on video when close examination of the artwork revealed an oddly shaped structure on the castle, closely resembling a human penis. Disney and the cover designer insist it was an accident, resulting from a late night rush job to finish the cover artwork. The questionable object does not appear {{on the cover of}} the second releasing of the movie. A second allegation is that a clergyman is seen with an erection during a scene late in the film. The clergyman is a short man, dressed in Bishop's clothing, and a small bulge is slightly noticeable in a few of the frames that are actually later shown to be the stubby-legged man's knees, but the image <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> is very difficult to distinguish. The combined incidents led an Arkansas woman to file suit against The Walt Disney Company in 1995, though she dropped the suit two months later.|$|E

5|$|Harmless and docile, the thornback {{guitarfish}} can {{be readily}} approached underwater, and fares well in public aquariums. Off the United States, this ray is common and faces no substantial threats: it is only occasionally caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and has no economic value. As most of its range lies within US waters, the species has been assessed as Least Concern overall by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, in Mexican waters the thornback guitarfish population <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> fragmented, {{and the degree to}} which it is affected by fishing is uncertain. There, the IUCN has listed it locally under Data Deficient while noting its susceptibility to inshore lagoon fisheries and shrimp trawlers, and the urgent need for additional information to ensure its long-term regional survival.|$|E
5|$|Heavily {{built and}} {{characteristically}} smooth, the pectoral fin disc of the short-tail stingray has a rather angular, rhomboid shape and is slightly wider than long. The leading {{margins of the}} disc are very gently convex, and converge on a blunt, broadly triangular snout. The eyes are small and immediately followed by much larger spiracles. The widely spaced nostrils are long and narrow; between them is a short, skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a fringed posterior margin. The modestly sized mouth has an evenly arched lower jaw, prominent grooves at the corners, and 5–7 papillae (nipple-like structures) on the floor. Additional, tiny papillae are scattered on the nasal curtain and outside the lower jaw. The teeth are arranged with a quincunx pattern into flattened surfaces; each tooth <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> blunt, with a roughly diamond-shaped base. There are 45–55 tooth rows in either jaw. The pelvic fins are somewhat large and rounded at the tips.|$|E
5|$|Hipposideros besaoka is an extinct bat from Madagascar in {{the genus}} Hipposideros. It is known from {{numerous}} jaws and teeth, which {{were collected in}} a cave at Anjohibe in 1996 and described as a new species in 2007. The site where H.besaoka was found is at most 10,000 years old; {{other parts of the}} cave have yielded H. commersoni, a living species of Hipposideros from Madagascar, and some material that is distinct from both species. H.besaoka was larger than H.commersoni, making it the largest insectivorous bat of Madagascar, and had broader molars and a more robust lower jaw. As usual in Hipposideros, the second upper premolar <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> displaced from the toothrow, and the second lower premolar is large.|$|E

5|$|In {{much of its}} range, Eurasian is {{the only}} {{nuthatch}} present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern rock nuthatches are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Krüper's nuthatch <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch {{is very similar to}} the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.|$|E
5|$|In their {{descriptions}} of Plesiorycteropus, Lamberton and Patterson posited different {{interpretations of the}} location of the mandibular fossa, where the mandible (lower jaw) articulates with the cranium. MacPhee found problems with either interpretation and suggested that the true mandibular fossa was part of the area Lamberton identified as such, {{at the side of the}} braincase. The fossa <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> low, suggesting that the animal was not capable of powerful biting. At the back of this fossa is a pseudoglenoid proces, which is more prominent in P.germainepetterae. In P.germainepetterae but not P.madagascariensis, a small opening, perhaps the vascular foramen, is present next to the foramen ovale. The petrosal bone forms a relatively large portion of the roof of the tympanic cavity, which houses the middle ear; parts of the petrosal are more developed in P.madagascariensis. Endocasts (casts of the inside of the skull) indicate that the neopallium part of the brain was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|The Australian raven's closest {{relatives}} {{are the other}} two species of raven occurring in Australia: the little raven and forest raven. The Australian raven is also somewhat {{closely related to the}} Torresian and little crow, although not as closely related as it is to the other raven species. Initial single gene genetic analysis of the genus using mitochondrial DNA showed the three raven species to belong to one lineage and the two crows to another. The genetic separation between species <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> there was a suggestion the little raven may be nested within the Australian raven, though the authors conceded more genetic work was needed. Subsequent multigene analysis using nuclear DNA by Jønsson and colleagues in 2012 showed the eastern and western subspecies of the Australian raven to form two clades, almost as genetically distinct as the forest and little raven are to each other. This led the authors to propose that the subspecies be recognised as separate species.|$|E

50|$|The {{honeycomb}} whipray has a diamond-shaped, rather thin {{pectoral fin}} disc slightly wider than long, with broadly rounded outer corners and concave leading margins converging on a pointed, protruding snout. The eyes <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> immediately followed by much larger spiracles. There is a skirt-shaped flap of skin with a finely fringed posterior margin between the long, narrow nostrils. The mouth is strongly bow-shaped, with shallow furrows at the corners, and contains {{a pair of}} papillae (nipple-shaped structures) on the floor. The teeth <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> have a low, transverse ridge on the crown. The pelvic fins <b>are</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> roughly triangular.|$|R
5|$|The animal has a {{karyotype}} of 46 chromosomes, with a {{total of}} 50 major arms on the autosomes (non-sex chromosomes). The X chromosome is submetacentric (with one arm slightly longer than the other) and the Y chromosome <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> acrocentric (with one very short and one long arm). The karyotype is conserved among species of Miniopterus; the number of chromosomes and arms is identical in M.griveaudi, the Malagasy M.aelleni and M.gleni, and even the Asian M.fuliginosus.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} finetooth shark is {{slender and}} streamlined. The snout is long and pointed, with the nares preceded by short, broadly {{triangular}} flaps of skin. The eyes are large and round, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broad with well-defined furrows at the corners. Twelve to 15 tooth rows occur {{on either side of}} the upper jaw and 1314 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} lower jaw. Each tooth <b>is</b> <b>small</b> <b>and</b> needle-like, with a narrow central cusp and smooth to minutely serrated edges. The five pairs of gill slits are long, measuring about half the length of the dorsal fin base.|$|E
