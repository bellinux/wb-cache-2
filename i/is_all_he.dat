5|$|At home, Homer {{finds the}} {{personalized}} bowling glove given to Marge by Jacques and realizes {{he may be}} losing her. It is not long until Bart realizes that Lisa's suspicions are proving to be true about their parents drifting apart and offers Homer some advice in keeping his mouth shut so it does not get worse. At work the next day, he cannot bring himself to eat the sandwich she made for him, saying that it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> has left of her. Marge leaves for her meeting with Jacques, but finds herself reminded of lifetime commitment throughout the drive. She comes to {{a fork in the}} road, one way leading to the nuclear plant, the other to Jacques' apartment. After an agonized hesitation at the crux of the decision, she surprises Homer at the plant and kisses him warmly. An ecstatic Homer abandons his work post to carry Marge away in his arms. His co-workers want to know what to tell the boss. To the sound of their cheers, he says to say {{that they are going to}} the backseat of his car and will not be back for ten minutes.|$|E
25|$|No. 5 — No. 5 The Film, {{is about}} Nicole Kidman, with whom an {{anonymous}} aspiring writer (Rodrigo Santoro) becomes enamoured; afterwards, a fragrant memory <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> retains of her. In 2008, the French model and actress Audrey Tautou became {{the face of}} Perfume No. 5. 2012 marked the first year that a man — actor Brad Pitt — represented a female fragrance. The bottle's stopper, cut like a diamond, {{is said to have}} been inspired by the geometry of the Place Vendôme in Paris.|$|E
500|$|Because Sullivan shields his {{background}} from his son, {{his attempt to}} preserve the father-son relationship is actually harmful. Tragedy brings Sullivan and his son together. Sullivan escapes from the old world with his son, and the boy finds an opportunity to strengthen the relationship with his father. Tyler Hoechlin, who portrayed Michael Jr., explained, [...] "His dad starts to realize that Michael <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> has now and how much he's been missing. I think the journey is of {{a father and son}} getting to know each other, and also finding out who they themselves are." ...|$|E

500|$|In his {{recollections}} {{from that}} period, writer Victor Eftimiu {{suggested that the}} relationship was not entirely harmonious: [...] "Camil Ressu, like other young unknown painters, {{found a lot of}} support and encouragement with Bogdan-Pitești. Truth be told, the maecenate was rather thrifty, it profited from the needs of the debuting and impoverished artist. But without it things would've been much worse, since others did not even offer as much". He also argued that, contrary to speculation about his wealth, Bogdan-Pitești [...] "maybe paid up so little because that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> had to spare". Reputedly, the Ileana boss was losing a fortune on maintaining the Vlaici manor, surrounded as it was by barren land.|$|E
500|$|The princesses of Ooo all {{wake up to}} find {{various parts}} of their bodies missing. They go to Finn and Jake, who promise to help them. Suspecting that the culprit is Ice King (voiced by Tom Kenny), they confront him. At first, he denies the allegations; he then shows them his new bride, Princess Monster Wife (voiced in tendem by Hynden Walch, Pendleton Ward, and Steve Little), a being {{made up of the}} stolen body parts. Horrified, Finn and Jake faint. Princess Monster Wife {{inquires}} as to who the two are, and the Ice King lies, saying that they are their children. Ice King, Princess Monster Wife, and an unconscious Finn and Jake all have dinner. Afterwards, Princess Monster Wife confesses to Ice King that she feels different, to which the Ice King responds by singing [...] "Something Special"; he argues that she <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> needs.|$|E
500|$|This companion, Martin, is a Manichaean scholar {{based on}} the real-life pessimist Pierre Bayle, who was a chief {{opponent}} of Leibniz. For {{the remainder of the}} voyage, Martin and Candide argue about philosophy, Martin painting the entire world as occupied by fools. Candide, however, remains an optimist at heart, since it <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> knows. After a detour to Bordeaux and Paris, they arrive in England and see an admiral (based on Admiral Byng) being shot for not killing enough of the enemy. Martin explains that Britain finds it necessary to shoot an admiral from time to time [...] "pour l'encouragement des autres" [...] (to encourage the others). Candide, horrified, arranges for them to leave Britain immediately. Upon their arrival in Venice, Candide and Martin meet Paquette, the chambermaid who infected Pangloss with his syphilis, in Venice. She is now a prostitute, and is spending her time with a Theatine monk, Brother Giroflée. Although both appear happy on the surface, they reveal their despair: Paquette has led a miserable existence as a sexual object, and the monk detests the religious order in which he was indoctrinated. Candide gives two thousand piastres to Paquette and one thousand to Brother Giroflée.|$|E

500|$|Politically, {{he had a}} lukewarm {{relationship}} with the Prime Minister, Peter Fraser – [...] "I can't persuade myself that he <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> quite appears to be", Newall noted in a private report – but the two worked together effectively. Small problems occasionally flared up, such as that in October 1942, when Fraser was reprimanded for not personally informing Newall of the resignation of four ministers. However, only one developed into a direct confrontation, when Newall became the last Governor-General to refuse to follow {{the advice of his}} cabinet. Newall was presented with a government recommendation to [...] four prisoners sentenced to be flogged, but refused to do so. He argued that if the government was opposed to flogging, it should repeal the legislation rather than simply remitting the sentences, and that it was constitutionally improper for the government to retain the law while ignoring it. Fraser, and his deputy Walter Nash, refused to accept this response, and the impasse stretched out for several days; in the end, a compromise was reached where Newall remitted the sentences but the government undertook to repeal the legislation.|$|E
2500|$|For example, say {{a subject}} says, [...] "The sun shines on the stone; the stone grows warm," [...] which <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> {{perceives}} in perception. His judgment is contingent and holds no necessity. But if he says, [...] "The sunshine causes the stone to warm," [...] he subsumes the perception {{under the category}} of causality, which is not found in the perception, and necessarily synthesizes the concept sunshine with the concept heat, producing a necessarily universally true judgment.|$|E
2500|$|He paints, {{or rather}} regards, {{things in a}} way that is {{different}} from that of other artists. He sees only the essential, and that, naturally, <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> paints. For this reason Munch's pictures are as a rule [...] "not complete", as people are so delighted to discover for themselves. Oh, yes, they are complete. His complete handiwork. Art is complete once the artist has really said everything that was on his mind, and this is precisely the advantage Munch has over painters of the other generation, that he really knows how to show us what he has felt, and what has gripped him, and to this he subordinates everything else.|$|E

2500|$|The prequel, Zuko's Story, is co-written by Alison Wilgus and Dave Roman and {{illustrated}} by Nina Matsumoto and was released on May 18, 2010. The synopsis for the graphic novel was released in early 2010, [...] "When Prince Zuko dared to question authority, his father, Fire Lord Ozai, banished him from the Fire Nation. Horribly scarred and stripped of everything he held dear, Zuko has wandered the earth for almost three years {{in search of his}} only chance at redemption: the Avatar, a mystical being who once kept the four nations in balance. Everyone he encounters believes that this is an impossible task, as the Avatar disappeared a century ago. But Zuko stubbornly continues the search. He must regain his honor, so his quest <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> has left." ...|$|E
2500|$|Duterte {{has been}} {{publicly}} very open about his infidelity and philandering while married to Zimmerman and cited {{it as the}} reason for his failed first marriage when asked in interviews. In 1998, Zimmerman filed a petition with the Regional Trial Court in Pasig to nullify her marriage. Duterte never appeared in court and did not contest Zimmerman's petition. Two years later, the court decided in her favor, ending the 27-year marriage of Duterte and Zimmerman. Duterte and Zimmerman have been on good terms in recent years with Zimmerman stating, [...] "Yes, [...] is really a very good leader. That <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> is. But when it comes to family, he is not capable of taking care of it." [...] In 2001, Zimmerman eventually ran for a seat on the city council but lost. Duterte and Zimmerman are said to have patched things up and appear to be civil to each other, 15 years after their marriage was declared null and void. Zimmerman eventually joined the campaign trail for Duterte's presidential candidacy in early 2016 called Byaheng Du30 in which she would travel by bus to major cities together with her daughter Sara and a number of delegates.|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, Chad was scripted {{as the son}} of Bill and Marsha Peterson. In June 2009 it was {{announced}} that David Leisure had been cast in the recurring role of D.A. Woods. In October 2009, the character's name was revised to Chad Peterson Woods when D.A. Woods was revealed to be his father. In February 2010 Soap Opera Digest reported that veteran soap actress, Jessica Tuck, known for her role as One Life to Live's Megan Gordon was cast in the role of Chad's mother. Deidrick explained that Chad goes to Kate for answers because she has been a [...] "mother figure." [...] Both the actor and executive producer Gary Tomlin enjoyed Chad's scenes with Koslow's Kate. Chad immediately confronts Madeline and he is [...] "completely devastated" [...] when she admits to being a former prostitute. Chad is fed up with his mother's lies and just wants everything out on the table. The revelation really impacts him in an [...] "inexplicable" [...] way. Deidrick described Chad's reaction as [...] "flabbergasted" [...] and wants to get away from her. When Chad witnesses Madeline's fall, he freezes for a moment because he is unable to [...] "process" [...] the situation. Such tragedy could have the potential to screw him up. Because Deidrick did not know the pain of losing a parent, let alone his own mother, the actor does his best to portray Chad during the scenes; Deidrick's first reaction as Chad is going into denial. Chad clings on to the little bit of courage he has left hoping to work things out with Charles in the future. According to Deidrick, the aftermath of his mother's death and his confrontation with Charles makes Chad a little [...] "cuckoo crazy." [...] Knowing Chad is all alone in the world Kate schemes to expose that Chad is Madeline's son with Kate's husband, Stefano DiMera (Joseph Mascolo) born on March 3, 1990, making him a whole year older than was initially said to be. The storyline showcased two very distinct sides to Chad's personality. According to Deidrick, during scenes with Kate, he intentionally emphasized Chad's vulnerabilities due to his mother's recent death; he is in desperate need of a mother figure at the moment, and Kate fills that void. Chad does not show that side of his personality too often for fear of getting hurt. On the other hand, Chad's relationship with his new found father Stefano appears to be a bit more volatile. The nature of the relationship is first displayed in November 2010 when Chad confronts Stefano with a knife and demands blood for a DNA test. Chad has no idea how to react to the DNA results. According to Deidrick, [...] " [...] struggles to find the courage to be able to love [...] who had a relationship with his mother and never knew he existed." [...] Deidrick explained that Chad rejects Stefano based on instinct. It <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> knows thanks to D.A. Woods who always pushes him away when things get difficult. However, Stefano is not easily turned away. Deidrick expected the role to be short lived thinking the character was only to wrap up the baby switch storyline. However, he accredited Gary Tomlin with fighting for the character and believing in him as an actor. Deidrick said that it was Tomlin's idea to attach him to a main family, [...] "So they made [...] a DiMera." ...|$|E
