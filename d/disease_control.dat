40|$|Background: The bile acid-activated nuclear {{receptor}} Farnesoid X Receptor (FXR) {{is critical}} in maintaining intestinal barrier integrity and preventing bacterial overgrowth. Patients with Crohn’s colitis (CC) exhibit reduced ileal FXR target gene expression. FXR agonists {{have been shown to}} ameliorate inflammation in murine colitis models. We here explore the feasibility of pharmacological FXR activation in CC. Methods: Nine patients with quiescent CC and 12 <b>disease</b> <b>controls</b> were treated with the FXR ligand chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA; 15 mg/kg/day) for 8 days. Ileal FXR activation was assessed in the fasting state during 6 hrs after the first CDCA dose and on day 8, by quantification of serum levels of fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 19. Since FGF 19 induces gallbladder (GB) refilling in murine models, we also determined concurrent GB volumes by ultrasound. On day 8 ileal and cecal biopsies were obtained and FXR target gene expression was determined. Results: At baseline, FGF 19 levels were not different between CC and <b>disease</b> <b>controls.</b> After the first CDCA dose, there were progressive increases of FGF 19 levels and GB volumes during the next 6 hours in CC patients and <b>disease</b> <b>controls</b> (FGF 19 : 576 resp. 537 % of basal; GB volumes: 190 resp. 178 % of basal) without differences between both groups, and a further increase at day 8. In comparison with a separate untreated control group, CDCA affected FXR target gene expression in both CC and <b>disease</b> <b>controls,</b> without differences between both groups...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the prevalence of}} metabolic syndrome (MS), obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) {{in a group of}} Mexican Mestizo patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis (CC) and to compare this group with patients with cirrhosis secondary to other causes (<b>disease</b> <b>controls).</b> METHODS: Patients with CC, diagnosed between January, 1990 and April, 2005, were included in a retrospective study. Patients with cirrhosis caused by chronic hepatitis C, alcohol abuse or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) served as <b>disease</b> <b>controls.</b> RESULTS: A total of 134 patients with CC were analyzed. <b>Disease</b> <b>controls</b> consisted of 81 patients with chronic hepatitis C, 33 with alcohol abuse and 20 with AIH. The median age of patients with CC was 57 years (range, 16 - 87); 83 (61. 9 %) patients were female; 53 (39. 6 %) were Child A, 65 (48. 5 %) Child B, and 16 (11. 9 %) were Child C cirrhosis. The prevalence of MS (29. 1 % vs 6 %; P < 0. 001), obesity (16. 4 % vs 8. 2 %; P = 0. 04) and T 2 DM (40 % vs 22. 4 %; P = 0. 013) was higher in CC patients than in <b>disease</b> <b>controls.</b> There were no differences in sex, age or liver function tests between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of MS, obesity and T 2 DM were higher in patients with CC than in patients with cirrhosis secondary to others causes. Our findings support the hypothesis that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) plays an under-recognized role in CC...|$|R

40|$|Primary {{sclerosing cholangitis}} (PSC) and cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) are both slowly progressive cholestatic liver diseases characterized by fibro-obliterative {{inflammation of the}} biliary tract. We hypothesized that dysfunction of the CF gene product, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), may explain why a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel disease develop PSC. We prospectively evaluated CFTR genotype and phenotype in patients with PSC (n= 19) compared with patients with inflammatory bowel disease and no liver disease (n= 18), primary biliary cirrhosis (n= 17), CF (n= 81), and healthy controls (n= 51). Genetic analysis of the CFTR gene in PSC patients compared with <b>disease</b> <b>controls</b> (primary biliary cirrhosis and inflammatory bowel disease) demonstrated a significantly increased number of mutations/variants in the PSC group (37 % vs 8. 6 % of <b>disease</b> <b>controls,</b> P= 0. 02). None of the PSC patients carried two mutations/variants. Of PSC patients, 89 % carried the 1540 G-variant-containing genotypes (resulting in decreased functional CFTR) compared with 57 % of <b>disease</b> <b>controls</b> (P= 0. 03). Only one of 19 PSC patients had neither a CFTR mutation nor the 1540 G variant. CFTR chloride channel function assessed by nasal potential difference testing demonstrated a reduced median isoproterenol response of 14 mV in PSC patients compared with 19 mV in <b>disease</b> <b>controls</b> (P= 0. 04) and 21 mV in healthy controls (P= 0. 003). These data indicate {{that there is an}} increased prevalence of CFTR abnormalities in PSC as demonstrated by molecular and functional analyses and that these abnormalities may {{contribute to the development of}} PSC in a subset of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. © Springer-Verlag 2003. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) {{reflects}} pathophysiological {{aspects of}} neurological diseases, where neuroprotective strategies and biomarkers are urgently needed. Therefore, biobanking is very relevant for biomarker discovery {{and evaluation of}} neurological diseases. Important and unique features of CSF biobanking are intensive collaboration in international networks and the tight application of standardized protocols. The current adoption of standardized protocols for CSF and blood collection as presented in this review enables biomarker studies in large cohorts of patients and controls. Another topic of this review is the selection of control groups, which influences the outcome of biomarker investigations. Control groups in CSF biobanks mainly consist of different <b>disease</b> <b>controls.</b> This is {{in part due to}} the fact that lumbar punctures are mostly performed for clinical indications and rarely for research purposes only, as it is a relatively invasive procedure. Moreover, there is a lack of homogenous criteria and definition of control groups. We therefore propose uniform consensus definitions for such control groups in biomarker research, i. e. Healthy controls (HC), Spinal anesthesia subjects (SAS), Symptomatic controls (SC), Inflammatory Neurological <b>Disease</b> <b>Controls</b> (CINDC), Peripheral Inflammatory Neurological <b>Disease</b> <b>Controls</b> (PINDC) and Non-inflammatory Neurological <b>Disease</b> <b>Controls</b> (NINDC). Another important aspect of CSF biobanking is quality control. Systematic studies to address effects of pre-analytical and storage variation on a broad range of CSF proteins are needed. In conclusion, biomarker research in neurodegenerative diseases has entered a new era due to the collaborative and multicenter efforts of many groups. The streamlining of biobanking procedures, including quality control, and the selection of optimal control groups for investigating biomarkers are important improvements to perform high quality biomarker studies. © 2014 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists...|$|R
