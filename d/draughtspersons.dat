5000|$|In 1959, the new All Canadian Atlas is {{a product}} of the joint efforts of geologists, meteorologists, prospectors, agronomists, <b>draughtspersons,</b> naturalists and especially, the Royal Canadian Air Force. Aerial {{photography}} was essential in mapping the vast north of Canada. In 1948, No. 413 RCAF Squadron/No. 13 (Photographic) Squadron flying specially converted Avro Lancaster 10P aircraft undertook the task of mapping Canada's Arctic. Three large islands were discovered and one island near Baffin Island was named [...] "Air Force" [...] in their honour.|$|E
50|$|A {{breadboard}} {{or other}} prototype {{version of the}} design for testing against specification may be built. It may involve the making of any alterations to the circuit to achieve compliance. A choice as to a method of construction {{as well as all}} the parts and materials to be used must be made. There is a presentation of component and layout information to <b>draughtspersons,</b> and layout and mechanical engineers, for prototype production. This is followed by the testing or type-testing a number of prototypes to ensure compliance with customer requirements. Usually there is a signing and approval of the final manufacturing drawings and there may be post-design services (obsolescence of components etc.).|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} little {{empirical}} research on the human aspects of CAD systems. In this paper observations on the analyses of designer activities are presented, by using a systems design approach. The paper concentrates on situation analysis and subsequent allocation of system tasks. A situation analysis {{was carried out in}} two design departments. The analysis consisted of a formal system description and a reconstruction interview. During the interview the previous week's activities were reconstructed with the help of photographs of the drawing board and protocols completed by design <b>draughtspersons.</b> This procedure was used for six design projects. In this study the technique of the reconstruction interview proved to be very useful and informative, and enabled three general conclusions to be made. First, designers liked the initial design phase and their responsibility for the final result. Second, they disliked the activities associated with drawing as well as the project documentation phase. Third, they preferred to work with two or more drawings on the drawing board. A number of frequent tasks could be identified, for example, large scale manipulation within and between drawings. In the final section, an example of a global allocation of system tasks for the design of a CAD system is given. ...|$|E

50|$|On {{returning}} to Australia in 1961, Gerda joined Melbourne University's Graduate Society and {{acted in a}} number of its amateur stage plays while working as a <b>draughtsperson</b> at the Victorian Health Department. A year later, she was spotted by a director who encouraged her to audition for a stage play, A Woman in a Dressing Gown. Scoring one of the main roles, she joined the ensemble on its tour of Australia and New Zealand. Nicolson later said that the producer awarded her with the role on account of her stunning legs.|$|R
50|$|Whitman {{moved to}} the Chicago area in 1921. She {{initially}} had difficulty finding work in Chicago architecture offices, even as a <b>draughtsperson.</b> Eventually she joined the firm of Perkins, Fellows, and Hamilton, where her drafting skills were highly valued. She obtained her Illinois architectural license in 1926 and began taking on independent commissions for residences. She settled in Evanston, Illinois, and during a career spanning six decades designed more than 50 residences as well as apartment buildings, schools, and churches. She worked mostly around Evanston, Glencoe, and Chicago, but she also designed buildings in the states of Florida, Georgia, Tennessee, Michigan, and Wisconsin.|$|R
50|$|Martini was {{initially}} rejected by some ninety firms in her search for architectural work, {{on at least}} two occasions because the firms refused to have women in their drafting rooms. She then changed her approach: she went to business school and obtained a secretarial job at an architectural firm, a position she leveraged to shift into drafting. She ended up working as a <b>draughtsperson</b> for a number of Chicago-area architects including John B. Sutcliffe, who specialized in churches. In 1913, when she took and passed her Illinois licensing exam, she was the only woman of the 86 applicants; and, following the departure of Marion Mahony Griffin in 1914, she would for some years be the only woman architect licensed in private practice by the state of Illinois.|$|R
50|$|The {{daughter}} of James Lewis Morris and Mary Agnes Menzies, both of Scottish descent, {{she was born}} Grace MacFarlane Morris in Pembroke and studied at Branksome Hall in Toronto. She was refused admission to the architecture school at the University of Toronto {{because she was a}} woman. Craig volunteered at the Petawawa military base during World War I. She later worked as an architectural <b>draughtsperson</b> with the firm of Craig and Madill; in 1923, she married architect James Henry Craig, one of the firm's founders. Craig went on to study at the Ontario College of Art. She was a long-time member of the Toronto Heliconian Club. Her work was included in a 1957 exhibition by the Ontario Society of Artists.|$|R
50|$|When studied {{through a}} University, the {{programme}} is structured in two parts: {{the first is}} a three-year course leading to a Bachelor of Architectural Studies or BSc (Architecture). The second is an additional two-year postgraduate, professional degree—either the Bachelor of Architecture or Master of Architecture, depending on University—which qualifies an individual to become an architect. A student can exit university after obtaining the first degree, and can become a senior architectural technologist. When studied through a University of Technology (or a comprehensive university), the courses in architecture are a three-year National Diploma, and, after an additional year of study, the B.Tech degree. These enable a student to become an architectural technologist or senior technologist, respectively. To become a <b>draughtsperson,</b> one requires a (two year) National Certificate.|$|R
50|$|She {{entered the}} University of Michigan College of Architecture and Design in 1914. She later {{recalled}} that the dean had initially {{told her she}} would not be welcome in the program, but she enrolled anyway. While at the university, she was a cofounder of the T-Square Society, a student club for women engineers and architects. When America entered World War I and most of her male classmates enlisted in the army, she took a leave from the college to support the war effort and so that {{she would be able to}} graduate with her classmates. During her two-year hiatus from school, she worked in Detroit, Michigan, as the Dodge Brothers Company's first woman <b>draughtsperson.</b> After the war, she returned to her studies and in 1920 became the college's first women architecture graduate.|$|R
