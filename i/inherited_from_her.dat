5|$|Descriptions of Imogen as a {{small child}} {{indicate}} that she had blue eyes, fair hair, an oval face reminiscent of her father's, and a rather prominent nose <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mother. In 1912, {{at the age of}} five, she joined the kindergarten class at the Froebel Institute, and remained at the school for five years. Holidays were often spent at the Holsts' rented country cottage at Thaxted in Essex, where Gustav Holst began an annual Whitsun Festival in 1916.|$|E
5|$|Billie is the {{youngest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal and her powers were <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> maternal grandmother, making Helen a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. Billie has the basic abilities of a witch, including casting spells, performing rituals, brewing potions, scrying for lost people or objects using of a crystal pendant, and communicating with the dead. She also has the power of telekinesis and later develops the ability to warp reality using a power known as projection. She is shown mastering her original powers very easily and adapting them using unconventional methods, such as attaching a large quartz crystal to her computer's mouse to scry through a GPS system. Her telekinesis enables her to perform acrobatic moves, such as backflips. However, she experiences difficulty using her power of projection due to her fear of hurting others. Billie eventually masters this power, and by the series finale she can easily travel through time.|$|E

5000|$|The {{court held}} that, {{although}} Pim had not caused her death, he had allowed the [...] testatrix to lead an immoral life {{and was the}} one who had encouraged her alcohol abuse; therefore he was unworthy to <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> estate.|$|R
5|$|Christy is {{the oldest}} of Carl and Helen Jenkins's two daughters. Both of her parents are mortal, and her powers were <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> {{maternal}} grandmother, making her a carrier of the genes determining magical ability. As a witch, Christy possesses the basic ability to cast spells, perform rituals, brew potions, scry for lost people or objects {{through the use of}} a crystal pendant, and communicate with the dead. She also possesses an advanced form of telepathy, enabling her to hear and project her thoughts, as well as channeling other magical creatures' powers. Carl and Helen Jenkins (David Starzyk and Barbara Niven) said Christy heard voices prior to her kidnapping, implying that this power was already active. As a firestarter, Christy had the power of pyrokinesis; this power could be augmented by Billie's projection powers to vanquish demons previously believed to be invincible. Christy was identified as the Key to the Ultimate Power due to her relationship with Billie. Demain of Television Without Pity compared Christy to Buffy the Vampire Slayer character Dawn Summers as they were both referenced as the Key.|$|E
5|$|The final {{enemy is}} Lorenzo, {{who seemed to}} be an ally, but who now menaces Fiona in several {{different}} forms. Fiona first meets him as an old, crippled man. He tells Fiona that Riccardo was always the problem child, and that he created both Riccardo and Ugo in an attempt to find a body with an Azoth which he could use to gain immortality. Ugo had the Azoth, but left the castle to marry Ayla. Now with Riccardo dead, Lorenzo believes that Fiona is his, so he can take the Azoth she <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> father. He chases after Fiona, but she is able to crush him in a rock press. However, she soon encounters a resurrected, youthful Lorenzo; the life energy he acquired from Riccardo's body has allowed him mastery over his own aging process. With the help of Hewie, Fiona causes Lorenzo to fall into a pit of lava. At this point, the castle begins to shake and collapse, and Lorenzo returns as a flaming skeleton. He chases Fiona as she heads for the exit, and attempts to block her escape, but as they reach the door, he finally dies, and Fiona and Hewie leave the castle.|$|E
5|$|According to Matteo Villani, Louis {{launched}} an expedition against the Golden Horde {{at the head}} of an army of 200,000 horsemen in April 1354. The young Tatar ruler, whom historian Iván Bertényi identified as Jani Beg, did not want to wage war against Hungary and agreed to sign a peace treaty. Although no other primary source mentioned that campaign and treaty, the Tatars made no plundering raids in Transylvania after 1354, which suggests that Villani's report is reliable. In the same year, Louis invaded Serbia, forcing Stefan Dušan to withdraw from the region along the river Sava. Under duress, Dušan initiated negotiations with the Holy See for acknowledgement of the popes' primacy. The following year, Louis sent reinforcements to Casimir III to fight against the Lithuanians, and Hungarian troops supported Albert II, Duke of Austria, against Zürich. The Venetian delegates offered Louis 6–7,000 golden ducats as a compensation for Dalmatia, but Louis refused to give up his plan to reconquer the province. He signed an alliance with Albert II of Austria and Nicolaus of Luxemburg, Patriarch of Aquileia, against Venice. Upon his order, Croatian lords besieged and captured Klis, a Dalmatian fortress that Stefan Dušan's sister, Jelena, had <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> husband, Mladen Šubić.|$|E

50|$|The {{source of}} funds for his initial {{investment}} in WA Wool were never made clear, since the $75,000 deposit for the purchase price of WA Wool shares came from a bank account that he shared with the partners in his law firm at the time, and his partners asked for these funds to be repaid. Nevertheless, since Holmes à Court had no other apparent source of income at the time, a possibility is that his mother Ethnee financed his first foray into business, since she had stood to <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> mother Florence, who in turn had stood to <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> second husband H.R. Cumming, a wealthy Rhodesian land owner, businessman and colleague of Cecil Rhodes himself. Cumming had helped raise Ethnee during her childhood on his estate outside Gweru. As an adult and while living in Rhodesia and South Africa, Ethnee had also established and sold both a riding school and a game lodge in Chobe, and eventually sold several properties that she owned as investments giving the funds to Robert to manage on her migration to Australia in 1967.|$|R

25|$|It {{is known}} that King Edward I (1272–1307) had long wanted to acquire Isabella's estates.

Then after her daughter and last surviving heir, Aveline, had died in 1274, a certain John de Eston was found (against expectations) by a jury at her inquisition post mortem to be Isabella's next heir. In 1278 this John de Eston quitclaimed her lands {{in the north and}} the County of Aumale and its associated lands to the Crown.|$|E
25|$|Females {{who carry}} one {{copy of the}} {{defective}} gene are carriers with a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their sons. In order for a female to be affected, she would need to have two copies of the mutated gene, one {{of which would be}} <b>inherited</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> father. Males affected with LNS do not usually have children due to the debilitating effects of the disease. It is possible for a female to inherit an X chromosome from her unaffected father, who carries a new mutation of the HGPRT gene. Under these circumstances, a girl could be born with LNS, and though there are a few reports of this happening, it is very rare. The overwhelming majority of patients with LNS are male.|$|E

The Breton ducal house and many breton noble families had followed a semi-Salic tradition which permitted a daughter to <b>inherit</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> father. The Blois-Penthièvre family received more estates in Brittany as partial compensation.|$|R
