25|$|The flight {{had been}} cleared to land at the Pointe-Noire airport, and was on {{approach}} to the runway when the crash occurred. According to the Russian Embassy, the flight had attempted an <b>emergency</b> <b>ditching</b> in the sea, {{but was unable to}} do so.|$|E
5000|$|The {{reactions}} of {{all members of}} the crew, the split second decision making and the handling of this emergency and evacuation was [...] "text book" [...] and an example to us all. To have safely executed this <b>emergency</b> <b>ditching</b> and evacuation, with the loss of no lives, is a heroic and unique aviation achievement.|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{advised the}} {{passengers}} {{to prepare for}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>ditching</b> and {{took control of the}} aircraft. The floats were deployed and a gentle ditching was made about 3 minutes after the initial noise had been heard, by which time the helicopter's cabin had filled with smoke. All 21 occupants evacuated on to liferafts and were then winched up into a Search and Rescue helicopter. After a strong fire consumed most of the floating helicopter, the remains broke up and sank.|$|E
50|$|The crew then {{contacted}} Marsa Brega Tower {{and asked}} for an emergency landing. The Captain asked the First Officer to restart the engine. As they prepared for an <b>emergency</b> landing (<b>ditching),</b> multiple warnings sounded in the cockpit. The Captain then ordered the First Officer to open the emergency hatch. The ATC asked the crew to confirm the emergency. As the First Officer confirmed the emergency, the aircraft impacted water.|$|R
5000|$|Snorkel: Generally, {{having a}} snorkel is {{unnecessary}} because [...] "it has no meaningful benefit", and its presence can create additional hazards {{because it can}} snag or catch on something (if on the head, it may create a hazard by catching on something and pull the mask off. If on the leg, it could snag when doing an <b>emergency</b> weight belt <b>ditch,</b> or snag on nets or lines). The lack of a snorkel when on the surface carries the advice to [...] "swim on your back".|$|R
50|$|During the war, the Japanese Imperial Navy {{constructed}} a seaplane base at Rekata Bay {{in the middle}} of 1942. It was used for offensive operations, mainly the nightly Washing Machine Charlie raids on Henderson Field, Guadalcanal. It was also used as an <b>emergency</b> landing and <b>ditching</b> area for aircraft damaged during the Battle of Guadalcanal. The base was bombed by U.S. forces from August 1942 to August 1943. In the following month, the Japanese evacuated the base. A U.S. Navy team flew in during 1943 and examined 15 wrecked Japanese aircraft. A single PBY from No. 6 Squadron RNZAF finally visited the abandoned base on 28 August 1945, losing a man, who was possibly eaten by a saltwater crocodile.|$|R
50|$|On 13 June 1959, {{the second}} sea trial was performed, which {{included}} full power runs and <b>emergency</b> <b>ditching</b> drills being tested; experience from this trial run {{resulted in the}} rapid addition of a hydrodynamic planning bow to reduce the tendency of the craft to dib into waves. Later tests were also conducted, including the first operational transition between land and water to prove its true amphibious capabilities, which had been viewed as a vital attribute. On 22 June 1959, the SR.N1 participated in its first 'operational' sortie during an exercise with the Royal Marines on Eastney Beach, Portsmouth; {{the performance of the}} craft during the exercise was commended by the services.|$|E
50|$|Enthusiastic Portuguese and Brazilian {{public opinion}} about the flight led the Portuguese {{government}} to send another Fairey III seaplane to complete the journey. The new plane, baptized Pátria, arrived at Fernando Noronha on May 6. After being refitted, the Pátria departed on May 11 with Coutinho and Cabral on board. They flew to the Saint Peter and Saint Paul Archipelago to resume the journey {{at the point where}} had been interrupted. However, an engine problem forced them to once again make an <b>emergency</b> <b>ditching</b> {{in the middle of the}} ocean, where they drifted for nine hours until being saved by the nearby British cargo ship Paris City, which carried them back to Fernando Noronha.|$|E

40|$|This report {{summarizes}} {{the results obtained}} in the experimental measurement of the reactor heat extracted by the coolant during two different scrams of the DR Reactor. These tests were conducted with the reactor flow carefully controlled to establish different reactor coolant temperatures following the scram. During normal reactor scrams, which {{have been used in}} the past to measure the reactor heat output, a high coolant flow was maintained. Consequently, the coolant outlet temperature dropped very quickly from an operating value of 90 to 95 C down to 20 to 30 C following the scram. Under emergency conditions, however, with only the last <b>ditch</b> <b>emergency</b> flow available, the coolant outlet temperature could remain as high as 80 to 90 C. This condition could prevail because of the small amount of last ditch flow available, and could last for 5 to as long as 70 minutes after the reactor scram...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft {{certification}} {{requires the}} analysis of water <b>emergency</b> landing (<b>ditching)</b> with respect to passenger safety. In order to support the design and certification processes, models for numerical simulation of aircraft ditching are being developed. Following the work developed in the SMAES project (SMart Aircraft in Emergency Situations, 2011 - 2014), which consisted in the enhancing of simulation capabilities for aircraft ditching analysis, DLR is transferring the acquired knowledge to full-scale aircraft ditching. Due to the complexity involved in fullscale modeling, a pre-processing tool is currently under development for an automatic model generation of full-scale aircraft ditching models for the explicit solver Virtual Performance Solution (VPS). The overall goal of this work is to implement and validate an aerodynamic model in the numerical simulation to allow an improvement {{in the state of}} the art of full-scale aircraft ditching. The developed model physically calculates the loads with proper aerodynamic equations and strongly improves the predictability of loads occurring during a ditching simulation. For the implementation of the aerodynamic model in the numerical simulation, the creation of a new module in the pre-processing tool is proposed. The aerodynamic calculation of lift, drag and pitch moment, based on the evolution of the angle of attack and ight velocity, is accomplished with the implementation of an external user subroutine within the numerical simulation. The superiority of the developed aerodynamic model over the state of the art is demonstrated based on comparison of results of sensitivity and parameter studies...|$|R
40|$|Aircraft design {{generally}} comprises {{three consecutive}} phases: Conceptual, preliminary and detailed design phase. The preliminary design phase {{is of particular}} interest as the basic layout of the primary structure is defined. Up to date, semi-analytical methods are widely used in this design stage to estimate the structural mass. Although these methods lead to adequate results for the major aircraft components of standard configurations, the evaluation of new configurations (e. g. box wing, blended wing body) or specific structural components with complex loading conditions (e. g. center wing box) is very challenging and demands higher fidelity approaches based on Finite Elements (FE). To accelerate FE model generation in multi-disciplinary design approaches, automated processes have been introduced. In order to easily couple different tools, a standardized data format - CPACS (Common Parameterized Aircraft Configuration Schema) - is used. The versatile structural description in CPACS, the implementation in model generation tools but also current limitations and future enhancements will be discussed. Recent development in the progress of numerical process chains for structural sizing but also for further applications including crash on solid ground and <b>ditching</b> (<b>emergency</b> landing on water) are presented in this paper...|$|R
5000|$|On January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 made an <b>emergency</b> <b>ditching</b> {{onto the}} Hudson River beside Manhattan. The flight was a {{domestic}} commercial passenger flight with 150 passengers and 5 crew members traveling from LaGuardia Airport in New York City to Charlotte Douglas International Airport in Charlotte. After striking {{a flock of}} Canada geese during its initial climb out, the airplane lost engine power and ditched in the Hudson River off Midtown Manhattan with no loss of human life. All 155 occupants safely evacuated the airliner, and were quickly rescued by nearby ferries and other watercraft. The airplane was still virtually intact though partially submerged and slowly sinking. The entire crew of Flight 1549 was later awarded the Master's Medal of the Guild of Air Pilots and Air Navigators. It was described by NTSB board member Kitty Higgins as [...] "the most successful ditching in aviation history".|$|E
40|$|Statistics {{show that}} <b>{{emergency}}</b> <b>ditching</b> and water impacts in emergency {{are likely to}} have tragic consequences. Most of the passive safety devices developed for aircraft crashworthiness is designed for ground impacts. Loads, when impacting a solid or a soft surface, are rather different and therefore energy absorption devices developed for ground impact are usually not effective during a water impact and specific devices must be developed. In 2005, a Group for Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe (GARTEUR), the AG 15, was established to improve the SPH method for application to helicopter ditching. In this framework, water impact drop tests, using a triangular cross-section specimen were carried out at Politecnico di Milano in order to collect reliable data for numerical models validation. Impact decelerations and pressures were measured. A pressure transducer suitable to measure impact pressures was developed. Hence, the numerical model was worked out adopting the SPH method to model the fluid region. Applications of the SPH method to water impact analysis are not common because of SPH model instability in unbounded regions. The conditions for SPH model stability were investigated and the accuracy of the overall model was evaluated referring to the data collected in the tests. Eventually, a close experimental-numerical correlation was obtained and guidelines for further investigations were drawn...|$|E
50|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{aircraft}} {{came to rest}} in the water, crew members ensured that all passengers put on life jackets and evacuated onto eight of the ten main deck emergency exits. These exits (as on all 747s) are specifically equipped with inflatable evacuation slide/rafts for <b>ditching</b> <b>emergencies.</b> The passenger cabin remained completely above water during the evacuation, although eventually sinking tail-first. Additional damage to the nose and first-class cabin was noted. There were 23 minor injuries among passengers or crew and the plane was written off as a total hull loss. The vertical stabilizer on the plane interfered with the accuracy of the ILS signals for runway 31, so it was removed with dynamite shortly after the crash. That permitted airliners to make safe ILS approaches whenever the wind patterns mandated the use of runway 31 (the reciprocal direction of runway 13). In addition, the China Airlines lettering and the Chinese characters were removed, as was part of the livery on the fuselage, {{in order to make it}} harder to identify the crashed aircraft as belonging to China Airlines. After the accident, the aircraft was stored by the HAECO building to be used for firefighting practice.|$|R
