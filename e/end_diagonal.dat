50|$|The {{king post}} truss is used for simple roof trusses and short-span bridges. It is the {{simplest}} form of truss {{in that it is}} constructed of the fewest number of truss members (individual lengths of wood or metal). The truss consists of two diagonal members that meet at the apex of the truss, one horizontal beam that serves to tie the bottom <b>end</b> of the <b>diagonals</b> together, and the king post which connects the apex to the horizontal beam below. For a roof truss, the diagonal members are called rafters, and the horizontal member may serve as a ceiling joist. A bridge would require two {{king post truss}}es with the driving surface between them. A roof usually uses many side-by-side trusses {{depending on the size of}} the structure.|$|R
40|$|A {{novel and}} {{efficient}} approach for the eigenvalue assignment of large first-order time-invariant systems is developed using full-state feedback and output feedback.

Third, the eigenvalue is moved to the desired location by a full-state feedback, without affecting the remaining eigenvalues. The second and third step can be repeated until all the assignable eigenvalues are moved to the desired locations.

Numerical examples are given to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed approach...|$|R
