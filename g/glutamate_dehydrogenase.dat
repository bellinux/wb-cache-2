25|$|GLUD1 (<b>glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> 1) is a {{mitochondrial}} matrix enzyme, one of {{the family}} of glutamate dehydrogenases that are ubiquitous in life, with a key role in nitrogen and glutamate (Glu) metabolism and energy homeostasis. This dehydrogenase is expressed at high levels in liver, brain, pancreas and kidney, but not in muscle. In the pancreatic cells, GLUD1 is thought to be involved in insulin secretion mechanisms. In nervous tissue, where glutamate is present in concentrations higher than in the other tissues, GLUD1 appears to function in both the synthesis and the catabolism of glutamate and perhaps in ammonia detoxification.|$|E

Elevation of liver enzyme activities, such a <b>glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> (GLDH), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), is detected in subacute or chronic fasciolosis from 12 to 15 weeks after ingestion of metacercariae. Economical effect of fasciolosis in sheep consists in sudden deaths of animals {{as well as in}} reduction of weight gain and wool production. In goats and cattle, the clinical manifestation is similar to sheep. However, acquired resistance to F. hepatica infection is well known in adult cattle. Calves are susceptible to disease but in excess of 1000 metacercariae are usually required to cause clinical fasciolosis. In this case the disease is similar to sheep and is characterized by weight loss, anemia, hypoalbuminemia and (after infection with 10,000 metacercariae) death. Importance of cattle fasciolosis consist in economic losses caused by condemnation of livers at slaughter and production losses especially due to reduced weight gain.|$|E

NADP-GDH present in the fungus and NAD-GDH present in non-infected roots were both detected in spruce and douglas mycorrhizas. By contrast, fungal NADP-GDH was suppressed in mycorrhizas of beech.

Of the pathway components, both Gdh 2 and Gdh 3 (Figure  3) are <b>glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> that degrade <b>glutamate</b> to ammonia (Miller and Magasanik 1990). C. albicans actively alters the pH of its environment by release of ammonia in vitro (Vylkova et al. 2011). The upregulation of Gdh 2 - and Gdh 3 -encoding genes suggested that C. albicans used ammonia for pH neutralization inside macrophages. Moreover, the gene encoding the ammonia transporter (Frp 3) was also upregulated (Figure  4), and this transporter could contribute to ammonia release (Vylkova and Lorenz 2014).|$|R

25|$|SGCs {{role as a}} {{regulator}} of neuronal microenvironment {{is further}} characterized by its electrical properties which {{are very similar to}} those of astrocytes. Astrocytes have a well studied and defined role in controlling the microenvironment within the brain, therefore researchers are investigating any homologous role of SGCs within the sympathetic ganglia. An established mode of controlling the microenvironment in sensory ganglia is the uptake of substances by specialized transporters which carry neurotransmitters into cells when coupled with Na+ and Cl−. Transporters for glutamate and gamma-Aminobutyric acid (GABA) have been found in SGCs. They appear to be actively engaged in the control of the composition of the extracellular space of the ganglia. The enzyme glutamine synthetase, which catalyzes the conversion of glutamate into glutamine, is found in large amounts in SGCs. Additionally, SGCs contain the glutamate related enzymes <b>glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> and pyruvate carboxylase, and thus can supply the neurons not only with glutamine, but also with malate and lactate.|$|E

Both {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide}} (NAD) EC 1.4.1.2] and {{nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate}} (NADP) dependent GluDH [...] enzymes are present in Plasmodia; the NAD-dependent GluDH is relatively unstable and not useful for diagnostic purposes. <b>Glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenase</b> provides an oxidizable carbon source used for the production of energy as well as a reduced electron carrier, NADH. Glutamate is a principal amino donor to other amino acids in subsequent transamination reactions. The multiple roles of glutamate in nitrogen balance make it a gateway between free ammonia and the amino groups of most amino acids. Its crystal structure is published. The GluDH activity in P.vivax, P.ovale and P. malariae has never been tested, but given the importance of GluDH as a branch point enzyme, every cell must have a high concentration of GluDH. It is well known that enzymes with a high molecular weight (like GluDH) have many isozymes, which allows strain differentiations (given the right monoclonal antibody).

40|$|<b>Glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> (GDHs) {{play key}} roles in {{cellular}} redox, amino acid, and energy metabolism, thus representing potential targets for pharmacological interventions. Here we studied the functional network {{provided by the}} three known <b>glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum. The recombinant production of the previously described PfGDH 1 as hexahistidyl-tagged proteins was optimized. Additionally, PfGDH 2 was cloned, recombinantly produced, and characterized. Like PfGDH 1, PfGDH 2 is an NADP(H) -dependent enzyme with a specific activity comparable to PfGDH 1 but with slightly higher K(m) values for its substrates. The three-dimensional structure of hexameric PfGDH 2 was solved to 3. 1 Å resolution. The overall structure shows high similarity with PfGDH 1 but with significant differences occurring at the subunit interface. As in mammalian GDH 1, in PfGDH 2 the subunit-subunit interactions are mainly assisted by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions, whereas in PfGDH 1 these contacts are mediated by networks of salt bridges and hydrogen bonds. In accordance with this, the known bovine GDH inhibitors hexachlorophene, GW 5074, and bithionol were more effective on PfGDH 2 than on PfGDH 1. Subcellular localization was determined for all three plasmodial GDHs by fusion with the green fluorescent protein. Based on our data, PfGDH 1 and PfGDH 3 are cytosolic proteins whereas PfGDH 2 clearly localizes to the apicoplast, a plastid-like organelle specific for apicomplexan parasites. This study provides {{new insights into the}} structure and function of GDH isoenzymes of P. falciparum, which represent potential targets for the development of novel antimalarial drugs...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRNA editing in {{flowering}} plant mitochondria is investigated by in vitro assays. These cauliflower mitochondrial lysates require added NTP or dNTP. We have now resolved {{the reason for}} this requirement to be the inhibition of the RNA binding activity of the <b>glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> (GDH). Both GDH 1 and GDH 2 were identified in RNA–protein cross-links. The inhibition of in vitro RNA editing by GDH is confirmed by the ability of the GDH-specific herbicide phosphinothricin to substitute for NTP. NADH and NADPH, but not NAD or NADP, can also replace NTP, suggesting that the NAD(P) H-binding-pocket configuration of the GDH contacts the RNA. RNA editing in plant mitochondria is thus intrinsically independent of added energy in the form of NTP...|$|R
40|$|The {{unfolding}} behaviour of the hexameric <b>glutamate</b> <b>dehydrogenases</b> from bovine liver, Clostridium symbosium and baker's yeast in solutions of {{guanidinium chloride}} (GdnHCl) was studied. Changes in Mr studied by light-scattering indicate that, in each case, the hexamer dissociates to form trimers, which then dissociate to monomers at higher concentrations of GdnHCl. Dissociation to trimers {{is accompanied by}} a reversible loss of enzyme activity, but no gross structural changes can be detected by fluorescence or c. d. Dissociation to monomers is accompanied by large structural changes, and the loss of activity cannot be reversed by dilution. The parallel behaviour of all three enzymes shows that the previously noted inability of the isolated subunits of the bovine liver enzyme to refold [Bell & Bell (1984) Biochem. J. 217, 327 - 330] is not a result of any modification of the enzyme as a result of import into mitochondria, since the C. symbosium and baker's-yeast enzymes do not undergo any such post-translational translocation...|$|R

During basidiospore germination on either glucose-NH 3 or glucose-glutamate medium, NADP-GDH increased six- to eightfold in specific activity, whereas NAD-GDH was depressed. During dikaryotic mycelial growth on either nitrogen source, the two GDH increased in a 1 : 1 ratio, whereas, during homokaryotic mycelial growth on glucose-NH 3, NADP-GDH activity was depressed and NAD-GDH increased six- to eightfold. Homokaryotic mycelium cultured on glucose-glutamate medium yielded high NADP-GDH activities and normal NAD-GDH activities. Intracellular NH 3 concentration and NADP-GDH activities were inversely related during spore germination and homokaryotic mycelium growth, whereas guanosine- 5 ′-triphosphate (GTP) and l-glutamine specifically inhibited NAD- and NADP-GDH respectively in vitro.

The presence of the tetrapeptide greatly destabilized the recombinant mutant at ambient pressure; however, the destabilizing effect was largely reversed by the application of pressure. Electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy of a spin-label attached to the terminal cysteine of rGDHt revealed a high degree of mobility, suggesting that destabilization is due to weakened intersubunit ion-pair interactions induced by thermal fluctuations of the tetrapeptide. For both enzymes, the stabilizing effect of pressure increased with temperature as well as pressure, reaching 36 -fold for rGDHt at 105 degrees C and 750 atm, the largest pressure-induced thermostabilization of an enzyme reported to date.

Paralogous duplications, gene elongation, and fusion events involving different his genes have {{played a major role in}} shaping this biosynthetic route. Evidence that the hisA and the hisF genes and their homologues are the result of two successive duplication events that apparently took place before the separation of the three cellular lineages is extended. These two successive gene duplication events as well as the homology between the hisH genes and the sequences encoding the TrpGtype amidotransferases support the idea that during the early stages of metabolic evolution at least parts of the histidine biosynthetic pathway were mediated by enzymes of broader substrate specificities. Maximum likelihood trees calculated for the available sequences of genes encoding these enzymes have been obtained.
