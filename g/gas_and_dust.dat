5|$|Interactions between {{galaxies are}} {{relatively}} frequent, {{and they can}} {{play an important role in}} galactic evolution. Near misses between galaxies result in warping distortions due to tidal interactions, and may cause some exchange of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|E
5|$|Collisions {{occur when}} two galaxies pass {{directly}} through {{each other and}} have sufficient relative momentum not to merge. The stars of interacting galaxies will usually not collide, but the <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> within the two forms will interact, sometimes triggering star formation. A collision can severely distort {{the shape of the}} galaxies, forming bars, rings or tail-like structures.|$|E

As {{the name implies}} the splash protection suits are designed to prevent the wearer from coming into contact with a liquid. These suits do not protect against gases or dust. Gastight suits additionally protect against <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The best is to {{read these}} {{instructions}} {{and follow the}} outline of this text. The coal mine production safety is one of China's current problems to be solved, {{do a good job}} monitoring and control of underground <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> coal <b>dust</b> is a key link to achieve safety in production. In this paper, the programming model is used to find the best ventilation rate and then control the mine <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> coal <b>dust</b> concentration effectively. Based on “Coal Mine Safety Regulations ” and characteristics of coal <b>dust</b> <b>and</b> <b>gas</b> explosion with the relationship of mutual influence, we come to the possibility of coal mine explosion hazard. Finally, with the linear regression knowledge, we figure out the relationship between the wind speed <b>and</b> concentration of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> coal <b>dust,</b> then we express the <b>gas</b> density <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> concentration {{in different parts of the}} mine by air volume function, through the limit of safe production on the <b>gas</b> concentration <b>and</b> coal <b>dust</b> concentration, to find constraints on air volume, construct a linear programming model, finally get optimum ventilation rate and the optimal control method. Putting forward the problems (1) Under the “Coal Mine Safety Regulations”, identify whether the mine belongs to “low gas mine” or “high-gas coal mine”...|$|R
5|$|Evolutionary {{studies of}} {{globular}} clusters {{can also be}} used to determine changes due to the starting composition of the <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> that formed the cluster.

5|$|Gravitational aggregations {{clustered}} into filaments, leaving voids in the gaps. Gradually, {{organizations of}} <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> merged {{to form the}} first primitive galaxies. Over time, these pulled in more matter, and were often organized into groups and clusters of galaxies, then into larger-scale superclusters.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{globular}} clusters discovered continued to increase, reaching 83 in 1915, 93 in 1930 and 97 by 1947. A total of 152 globular clusters {{have now been}} discovered in the Milky Way galaxy, out of an estimated total of 180 ± 20.

5|$|Both {{stable and}} {{unstable}} isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but the radioisotopes do not last long. It {{is believed that}} most of the stable beryllium in the universe was originally created in the interstellar medium when cosmic rays induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b> Primordial beryllium contains only one stable isotope, 9Be, and therefore beryllium is a monoisotopic element.|$|E
5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b> This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane.

5|$|Comets {{are small}} Solar System bodies, {{typically}} {{only a few}} kilometres across, composed largely of volatile ices. They have highly eccentric orbits, generally a perihelion within the orbits of the inner planets and an aphelion far beyond Pluto. When a comet enters the inner Solar System, its proximity to the Sun causes its icy surface to sublimate and ionise, creating a coma: a long tail of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> often {{visible to the naked}} eye.|$|E

50|$|The Egg Nebula's {{defining}} {{feature is}} the series of bright arcs and circles surrounding the central star. A dense layer of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dusts</b> enshrouds the central star, blocking its direct light from our view.

5|$|Neon is {{abundant}} on a universal scale; {{it is the}} fifth most abundant chemical element in the universe by mass, after hydrogen, helium, oxygen, and carbon (see chemical element). Its relative rarity on Earth, like that of helium, is due to its relative lightness, high vapor pressure at very low temperatures, and chemical inertness, all properties which tend {{to keep it from}} being trapped in the condensing <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> clouds that formed the smaller and warmer solid planets like Earth.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{remarkable}} discoveries was that the comet had a third type of tail. In addition to the well-known <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> tails, Hale–Bopp also exhibited a faint sodium tail, only visible with powerful instruments with dedicated filters. Sodium emission had been previously observed in other comets, but had not been shown to come from a tail. Hale–Bopp's sodium tail consisted of neutral atoms (not ions), and extended to some 50 million kilometres in length.|$|E
5|$|Shapley's {{measurements}} {{also indicated}} that the Sun is relatively far {{from the center of}} the galaxy, also contrary to what had previously been inferred from the apparently nearly even distribution of ordinary stars. In reality, most ordinary stars lie within the galaxy's disk and those stars that lie in the direction of the galactic centre and beyond are thus obscured by <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust,</b> whereas globular clusters lie outside the disk and can be seen at much further distances.|$|E

The flame propagation velocity and the explosion temperature were measured for explosion tests with the different methane concentration in the mixture. The flame evolution histories were also captured by high speed camera. The inhibiting efficiency of water mist was qualitatively studied and analyzed by explaining mechanism of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> goal <b>dust</b> explosion. The results showed that water mist can efficiently decline the flame propagation velocity, reduce flame temperature, and change flame characteristics of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> coal <b>dust</b> explosion.

Purpose: study {{of the laws of}} transformation of the organic mass of storage battery scrap under the conditions of the blast smelting, study of the influence of production conditions on the physicochemical properties of <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> of the secondary lead production and selection on their basis of the optimum conditions for gas cleaning in bag filters to meet the sanitary standards. The work develops a condensation-mass method of determination of organic gummy substances in <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> of the secondary lead production and adds new findings to the methods of investigation of the physicochemical properties of <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b> Use was made of the thermo-gravimetric method of investigation of the burning and pyrolisis processes of the storage battery scrap organic mass and of methods of spectral and chemical analysis in studying the properties of the substances under investigation. The work offers a mechanism and a method of calculation of the storage battery scrap organic mass transformation processes under the conditions of the blast smelting. Data characterizing the burning and pyrolisis of ebonite are obtained.

40|$|Coal mine <b>gas,</b> {{spontaneous}} combustion <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> encountered in underground coal mines {{have long been}} recognised as safety and health hazards to mine operators. Current solutions to these issues may involve extensive pre- <b>and</b> post <b>gas</b> drainage practice, goaf inertisation strategies, dust suppression with water sprays or scrubbers. However, {{the effect of these}} control measures varies significantly from site to site owing to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the flow characteristics of the hazardous <b>gases</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> particles under various mining conditions. With the development of computer technology, numerical solutions to the governing equations of fluid flow and its related processes can be obtained approximately by means of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling technique, which has been accepted as an indispensable predictive and design tool in almost every branch of fluid dynamics and engineering fields. A comprehensive literature review of the CFD applications in understanding the <b>gas,</b> spontaneous heating <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> issues for underground coal mines has been carried out, indicating the necessity of further exploring the CFD technique in solving these issues faced by underground coal mines...|$|R
5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust.</b> As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of galaxies can be significantly affected by interactions and collisions. Mergers of galaxies were common {{during the early}} epoch, {{and the majority of}} galaxies were peculiar in morphology. Given the distances between the stars, the great majority of stellar systems in colliding galaxies will be unaffected. However, gravitational stripping of the interstellar <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> that makes up the spiral arms produces a long train of stars known as tidal tails. Examples of these formations can be seen in NGC 4676 or the Antennae Galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The unusually low {{metallicity}} of Vega {{makes it}} a weak Lambda Boötis-type star. However, {{the reason for the}} existence of such chemically peculiar, spectral class A0-F0 stars remains unclear. One possibility is that the chemical peculiarity {{may be the result of}} diffusion or mass loss, although stellar models show that this would normally only occur near the end of a star's hydrogen-burning lifespan. Another possibility is that the star formed from an interstellar medium of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> that was unusually metal-poor.|$|E

5|$|Uneven heating {{can cause}} newly {{generated}} gases {{to break out}} of a weak spot on the surface of comet's nucleus, like a geyser. These streams of <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> can cause the nucleus to spin, and even split apart. In 2010 it was revealed dry ice (frozen carbon dioxide) can power jets of material flowing out of a comet nucleus. Infrared imaging of Hartley 2 shows such jets exiting and carrying with it dust grains into the coma.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} by the Sun and may become visible when a comet passes through the inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation.

5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen, as well as by a rather intense ionosphere. Callisto is thought to have formed by slow accretion from the disk of the <b>gas</b> <b>and</b> <b>dust</b> that surrounded Jupiter after its formation. Callisto's gradual accretion and the lack of tidal heating meant that not enough heat was available for rapid differentiation. The slow convection in the interior of Callisto, which commenced soon after formation, led to partial differentiation and possibly to the formation of a subsurface ocean at a depth of 100150km and a small, rocky core.|$|E
