Also present are Catherine's sister Dawn (Barbara Williams and her husband Gil. In Maryland, Henry Dion (Mike Starr) follows a woman home and murders her; he is later visited by a strange man hiding his face behind dark glasses—it becomes apparent that this <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> has been sending Black threatening polaroid pictures. Dion thanks the man (Paul Raskin) for finding the victim for him, but is chided for not committing the murder while Black was in the area. Dion takes the corpse into the woods to bury it, all the while speaking to it as though in conversation.|$|E
5|$|In Las Vegas Rachel {{falls in}} {{with a group of}} skaters who live {{together}} and play in a band, after becoming intrigued by one of the boys who wears a shirt with a cassette on it. Mr. Will finds her and pleads with her to confess to having sex with someone else so that he can return to their community. Rachel becomes romantically involved with Clyde, one of the skaters, and one night he offers to marry her, saying that together they can look for the man on the tape, who Rachel thinks is the father of her child.

25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. He <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E

"Christmas Tree" [...] is {{a version}} of the {{traditional}} Christmas song [...] "Deck the Halls", with the same melody but with lyrics changed to be sexually suggestive, with many sexual innuendos and metaphors.

He cites the original first line, [...] "Cold <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> can't love", and says that Gaga [...] "seeks not to warn against becoming a cold, loveless man, but to prevent that fate by way of some hot lovin'".|$|E

Graham inquires as {{to the nature of}} Soma's powers, to which Soma responds that he has [...] "the power to rule," [...] causing Graham to panic and flee. Concerned, Soma confides this incident to Yoko, who recommends that Soma join her in stopping Graham. As Soma proceeds further through the castle, he comes upon a scene of Graham stabbing Yoko with a knife. Graham retreats, and Yoko warns Soma of Graham's power.

[...] "Equally {{delightful}} is the Alison Lohman character's evolution into an older woman (Jessica Lange). It's a metamorphosis to equal any in screen history." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli found the fairy tale approach reminiscent of The Princess Bride (1987) and the films of Terry Gilliam. [...] "Big Fish is a clever, smart fantasy that targets the child inside every adult," [...] Berardinelli said, [...] "without insulting the intelligence of either." [...] Roger Ebert, in a mixed review, wrote [...] "there is no denying that Will has a point: The old man is a blowhard. There is {{a point at which}} his stories stop working as entertainment and segue into sadism." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine was disappointed, finding the father-son reconciliation storyline to be over-dramatically cliché. [...] "You recall The Boy Who Cried Wolf? Edward Bloom <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> cried fish." [...] Big Fish was #85 on Slant Magazine's best films of the 2000s.|$|E

500|$|Adam Baldwin as Jayne Cobb– a mercenary. He and Mal {{met when}} they were on {{opposite}} sides of a dispute; Mal, while held at gunpoint, offered Jayne his own bunk and a higher cut than his current employer, so Jayne switched sides and shot his then-partners. In the original pilot, [...] "Serenity", he intimates to Mal that he did not betray him because [...] "The money wasn't good enough." [...] However, previously he had pointedly asked the Alliance agent whether he would be required to turn on the captain to help him, and in [...] "Ariel" [...] defends his actions in alerting the authorities regarding Simon and River by claiming he had not intended to betray Mal. He is someone who can be depended on in a fight. He tends to act like a [...] "lummox" [...] who thinks he is the smartest person in space, but occasional hints of intelligence peek through this façade, giving the impression that he acts dumber than he is. As Whedon states several times, Jayne <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who</b> will ask the questions that no one else wants to. Even though he is a macho character, he has shown a particularly intense fear of Reavers, more so {{than the rest of the}} crew. Despite his amoral mercenary persona, he sends a significant portion of his income to his mother, again suggesting that there is more to his character than what he presents to the rest of the crew.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from October 8, 1910. It states: [...] "John Warren, a prosperous young clerk, is run down by a taxi cab while crossing a city street. The chauffeur, Allen, afraid {{of the consequences of}} his carelessness, makes his escape when he sees a crowd gathering around his victim. He abandons his machine on a lonely country road, and catching a westbound train, succeeds in making good his escape. Six years later finds John, now a cripple, living in a mining town with his devoted wife. Here John, incapacitated from other work, lives out a miserable existence as the timekeeper at the mine. Here, also, Allen comes, applying for work as a miner. They do not recognize each other. John, poor and ill, is visited by another misfortune. His beloved wife, who has clung to him through all the years of his adversity, sickens and dies. His one joy in life is taken from him. John refuses to be comforted by Allen, who feels deep sympathy for the poor cripple. While reciting his sad history to Allen, John learns {{for the first time that}} Allen <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>who,</b> by crippling him, wrecked his life. At last the vengeance he has sought all these years is within his reach. He raises his gun to end Allen's existence, when a vision of his wife appears, breathing the message, 'Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord.' John rushes from the house to the grave of his loved one, and there, after forgiving Allen, dies at peace with mankind." ...|$|E
