Once viewers began to warm to Lockhart and Reilly as Timmy's parents, the Martin family was accepted and embraced by the public. As a result, between 1960 and 1964, Lassies ratings greatly improved and by the spring of 1964, it received its highest rating ever, ranking at #13.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Dooley {{was invented}} by Dunne to replace a similar {{character}} whose real-life analogue had objected. By having the garrulous bartender speak in dialect and live in an unfashionable area of Chicago Dunne gained a freedom of expression he often did not have in standard English. The <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of the weekly column made Mr. Dooley popular in Chicago, but little noticed elsewhere. Dunne was a rapidly rising newspaperman, and the pieces mainly appeared in the Chicago paper which he worked for. During that time, Dunne detailed the daily life of Bridgeport through Dooley's lips, painting a portrait of ethnic urban life unparalleled in 19th-century American literature.|$|E

5|$|The Norfolk and Western Railway {{was one of}} {{the twenty}} railroads which joined Amtrak in 1971 but in the <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> hosted no {{passenger}} service over its route, the centerpiece of which was its main line between Norfolk and Cincinnati which passed through the state of West Virginia. The main driving force behind the establishment of the Mountaineer was then-United States Senator Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia), who wanted additional rail service for his constituents and pressured the Department of Transportation to add the route.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} founded by the Reverend Joseph Farrall Wright, Perpetual curate of Christ Church Bolton and Thomas Ogden, the {{schoolmaster}} at the adjacent church school in 1874 as Christ Church F.C. It was initially run from {{the church of the}} same name on Deane Road, Bolton, on the site where the Innovation factory of the University of Bolton now stands. The club left the location following a dispute with the vicar, and changed its name to Bolton Wanderers in 1877. The name was chosen as the club initially had a lot of difficulty finding a permanent ground to play on, having used three venues in its <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of existence.|$|E
5|$|The tree {{of heaven}} is a very rapidly growing tree, {{possibly}} the fastest growing tree in North America. Growth of one to two metres (3.3 to 6.6ft) per year for the <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> is considered normal. Shade considerably hampers growth rates. Older trees, while growing much slower, still do so faster than other trees. Studies found that Californian trees grew faster than their East Coast counterparts, and American trees in general grew faster than Chinese ones.|$|E

5|$|A year later, he {{was elected}} to the Netherlands' {{national}} parliament, but his <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> in parliament drew little attention. However, his appointment in 2002 as a public spokesman for the VVD led Wilders to become more well known for his outspoken criticism of Islamic extremism. Tensions immediately developed within the party, as Wilders found himself to be to the right of most members, and challenged the party line in his public statements. He was expelled from the VVD parliamentary party, and in September 2004, Wilders left the VVD, having been a member since 1989, to form his own political party, Groep Wilders, later renamed the Party for Freedom. The crunch issue with the VVD party line was about his refusal to endorse the party's position that European Union accession negotiations must be started with Turkey.|$|E
5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic for the <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much time should be set aside for it. Educational classes should be held {{in a part of}} the mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
5|$|Hamar Sportsanlegg (HSA) was {{established}} in 2003 to execute the plan. It was owned 34 percent by the municipality, and 22 percent each by Ham-Kam, Hamar IL and Storhamar Dragons. In 2004, Storhamar's share was transferred to Hamar Olympiske Anlegg, a municipal company which owns Vikingskipet Olympic Arena and Hamar Olympic Amphitheater. A report estimated the technical value of Briskeby to NOK6 million, while the sales price of the lot was estimated at NOK30 million. The municipal council voted on 18 February 2004 to transfer the ownership of the two stadiums to the new company. Ham-Kam rented the venues from HSA, with HSA's deficit for the <b>first</b> <b>four</b> <b>years</b> being covered by the municipality. Of the NOK20.8 million in value transferred to the company, NOK14.5 million was paid by HSA taking over the municipality's obligation {{to build a new}} athletics venue should Hamar stadion be closed, and NOK5 million was debt.|$|E
