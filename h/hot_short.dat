25|$|Early iron {{smelting}} {{made use}} of bloomeries which produced two layers of metal: one with a very low carbon content which is worked into wrought iron, and one with a high carbon outer layer. Since the high carbon iron is <b>hot</b> <b>short,</b> meaning it fractures and crumbles when forged, it was not useful without more smelting. As a result, it went largely unused in the west until the popularization of the finery forge. The wrought iron, with nearly no carbon in it, was very malleable and ductile but not very hard.|$|E
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{remedies}} for sulfur contamination. The first, and the one most used in historic and prehistoric operations, is avoidance. Coal was not used in Europe (unlike China) as a fuel for smelting because it contains sulfur and therefore causes <b>hot</b> <b>short</b> iron. If an ore resulted in <b>hot</b> <b>short</b> metal, ironmasters looked for another ore. When mineral coal was first used in European blast furnaces in 1709 (or perhaps earlier), it was coked. Only with the introduction of hot blast from 1829 was raw coal used.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>short</b> iron is brittle when hot. This was {{a serious}} problem as most iron used during the 17th and 18th century was bar or wrought iron. Wrought iron is shaped by {{repeated}} blows with a hammer while hot. A piece of <b>hot</b> <b>short</b> iron will crack if worked with a hammer. When a piece of hot iron or steel cracks the exposed surface immediately oxidizes. This layer of oxide prevents the mending of the crack by welding. Large cracks cause the iron or steel to break up. Smaller cracks can cause the object to fail during use. The degree of hot shortness is {{in direct proportion to}} the amount of sulfur present. Today iron with over 0.03% sulfur is avoided.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hot</b> <b>short</b> iron can {{be worked}}, {{but it has}} to be worked at low {{temperatures}}. Working at lower temperatures requires more physical effort from the smith or forgeman.

5000|$|Sulfur (S) is a {{frequent}} contaminant in coal. It is also present in small quantities in many ores, but can be removed by calcining. Sulfur dissolves readily in both liquid and solid iron at the temperatures present in iron smelting. The effects of even small amounts of sulfur are immediate and serious.

40|$|Under {{existing}} probabilistic {{risk assessment}} (PRA) methods, {{the analysis of}} fire-induced circuit faults has typically been conducted on a simplistic basis. While exceptions do exist, a typical fire PRA will assume that given damage to any power or control cables, the associated circuits simply become unavailable. This approach does not address, for example, the potential that certain failures might cause spurious component actuations. In particular, certain cable failure modes, referred to as <b>hot</b> <b>shorts,</b> might lead to spurious operations. Those fire PRAs that have considered potential spurious operations have relied on methodologies that have significant uncertainties {{with regard to the}} scope of the assessments, the underlying methods, and the assumptions employed. Nonetheless, some of these fire PRAs have shown that cable <b>hot</b> <b>shorts</b> can be a significant risk contributor. This report describes the results of a task to address weaknesses in existing fire PRA circuit analysis methods. An extensive review of available cable failure data has been performed and the current state of knowledge regarding cable failure modes and likelihood is characterized. A framework for advanced methods of cable failure mode and likelihood analysis is also presented. Advanced tools for performing PRA circuit analysis that explicitly treat different cable failure modes and the resulting circuit and system impac...|$|R
5000|$|Some metals are [...] "hot short", {{meaning they}} lose their tensile {{strength}} when heated. They become like Plasticine: although they may still be manipulated by squeezing, an attempt to stretch them, even by bending or twisting, {{is likely to have}} them crack and break apart. This is a problem for some blade-making steels, which must be worked carefully to avoid developing hidden cracks that would cause failure in the future. Though rarely hand-worked, titanium is notably <b>hot</b> <b>short.</b> Even such common smithing processes as decoratively twisting a bar are impossible with it.|$|E
