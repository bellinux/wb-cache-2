5|$|A {{physical}} USB <b>device</b> may {{consist of}} several logical sub-devices that {{are referred to}} as <b>device</b> functions. A single <b>device</b> may provide several functions, for example, a webcam (video <b>device</b> function) with a built-in microphone (audio <b>device</b> function). This kind of <b>device</b> is called a composite <b>device.</b> An alternative to this is compound <b>device,</b> in which the host assigns each logical <b>device</b> a distinctive address and all logical devices connect to a built-in hub that connects to the physical USB cable.|$|E

5|$|Endpoints {{are grouped}} into {{interfaces}} and each interface {{is associated with}} a single <b>device</b> function. An exception to this is endpoint zero, which is used for <b>device</b> configuration and is not associated with any interface. A single <b>device</b> function composed of independently controlled interfaces is called a composite <b>device.</b> A composite <b>device</b> only has a single <b>device</b> address because the host only assigns a <b>device</b> address to a function.|$|E

5|$|PING asks a <b>device</b> if it {{is ready}} to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair. PING is usually sent by a host when polling a <b>device</b> that most {{recently}} responded with NAK or NYET. This avoids the need to send a large data packet to a <b>device</b> that the host suspects to be unwilling to accept it. The <b>device</b> responds with ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate.|$|E
5|$|This {{allows the}} host to perform bus {{management}} action like enumerating new USB devices via retrieving the new <b>device</b> <b>device</b> descriptors. Retrieval of the <b>device</b> descriptors would especially allow {{for determining the}} USB Class, VID, and PID, which are often used for determining the correct USB driver for the <b>device.</b>|$|E
5|$|When a USB <b>device</b> {{is first}} {{connected}} to a USB host, the USB <b>device</b> enumeration process is started. The enumeration starts by sending a reset signal to the USB <b>device.</b> The data rate of the USB <b>device</b> is determined during the reset signaling. After reset, the USB device's information is read by the host and the <b>device</b> is assigned a unique 7-bit address. If the <b>device</b> {{is supported by the}} host, the <b>device</b> drivers needed for communicating with the <b>device</b> are loaded and the <b>device</b> is set to a configured state. If the USB host is restarted, the enumeration process is repeated for all connected devices.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted to analyze the use of cohesive <b>devices</b> in English Department studentsÂ’ theses at University of Muhammadiyah Malang since the use of cohesive <b>devices</b> in the theses was useful to shape the cohesion of writing in thesis. The research questions were formulated {{to find out the}} types of cohesive <b>devices</b> used in the theses and whether cohesive <b>devices</b> used appropriately in the theses. Therefore, this study used descriptive qualitative research to describe the use of cohesive <b>devices</b> and then investigate the inappropriate use of cohesive <b>devices</b> in the theses. In addition, in this study, the population was 123 English Department studentsÂ’ theses published in 2011 which could be found in the Central Library of UMM by November 2011. However, there were only 12 theses chosen as the sample of the study with simple random sampling applied in it. Besides, to collect the data in the theses, the documentation technique was used. The obtained data were analyzed using two procedures to find out the types of cohesive <b>devices</b> and their inappropriate use of cohesive <b>devices</b> in the theses. As a result, this study found that either the use of cohesive <b>devices</b> or the inappropriate use of cohesive <b>devices</b> in English Department studentsÂ’ theses was found. For the types of cohesive <b>devices,</b> it was supported with 1641 <b>devices</b> found in the theses and those were divided into 1235 <b>devices</b> which belonged to grammatical cohesive <b>devices</b> consisting of reference, substitution, and conjunction and 406 <b>devices</b> which belonged to lexical cohesive <b>devices</b> consisting of reiteration (repetition, synonym, superordinate, and general word) and collocation. For the inappropriate use of cohesive <b>devices,</b> there were 35 <b>devices</b> consisting of 21 <b>devices</b> of grammatical cohesive <b>devices</b> and 14 <b>devices</b> of lexical cohesive <b>devices.</b> It means that from 1641 (100...|$|R
40|$|We present two {{algorithms}} for {{indoor positioning}} estimation in peer-to-peer networks. The setup is {{a network of}} two types of devices: reference <b>devices</b> with a known location and blindfolded <b>devices</b> that can determine distances to reference <b>devices</b> and each other. From this information the blindfolded <b>devices</b> try to estimate their positions. A typical scenario is navigation inside a shopping mall where <b>devices</b> {{in the parking lot}} can make contact with GPS satellites, whereas <b>devices</b> inside the building make contact with each other, <b>devices</b> on the parking lot, and <b>devices</b> fixed to the building.

5|$|If a <b>device</b> {{key is to}} be revoked, {{the media}} key blocks on all discs {{manufactured}} after the time of revocation are encrypted {{in a way which}} does not enable the revoked <b>device</b> to obtain a valid processing key. Users trying to view new content on a revoked player would be forced to upgrade their player software to a more secure version, thereby limiting the scope of the compromise each time an exploit is discovered. While a compromised <b>device</b> or processing key could be used to decrypt a large number of discs, BackupHDDVD does not use these keys because they can be revoked by AACS LA. Because the AACS revocation system works by preventing a given <b>device</b> or player from calculating a valid volume unique key, BackupHDDVD circumvents the system entirely by relying on volume or title keys leaked from authorized players. With these keys BackupHDDVD is not subject to <b>device</b> revocation and is able to decrypt the content directly, bypassing the key exchange and verification process.|$|E
