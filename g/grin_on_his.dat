One, for example, depicts Hanna walking down Wall Street, bags {{of money in}} each hand and a <b>grin</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. [...] Another shows only Hanna's hand and wrist—and McKinley dangling from his fob chain. [...] One that {{is intended to be}} funny depicts McKinley as a small boy accompanied by Hanna as nursemaid; McKinley tugs at Hanna's skirts, wanting to go into a shop where the labor vote is for sale. [...] Another shows Hanna wearing a Napoleon hat (McKinley was said to resemble the late emperor), raising a mask of McKinley's face to his own.|$|E
500|$|After his conviction, Chandler {{was named}} by media {{as one of}} Florida's most notorious criminals. He said that his last words before his {{execution}} would be: [...] "Kiss my rosy red ass". In May 2011, comparisons were drawn between Chandler's case and trial in 1994, and the murder case and the upcoming trial of Casey Anthony. In both cases heightened media attention forced the selection of jurors who lived outside the county where the crime had been committed. One of the jurors in Chandler's 1994 trial, identified as Roseann Welton, said that: [...] "He scared some of the jurors when he would sit there and stare at you and have that stupid <b>grin</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.

One of Pollard's attempts to advertise his stallion involved letting {{one of his}} ranch hands take the horse to a local jackpot roping. Pollard assumed that the hand would just ride Lightning Bar around and show him off, but he later discovered that more was involved. Pollard said later that [...] "I should have been suspicious when he (the ranch hand) returned with Lightning Bar that afternoon, with a sheepish <b>grin</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face. I asked him how the horse was received and he said 'The stud did good and I won the jackpot!' After congratulating him, I asked which rope horse he had used. He replied, 'The stud.'" ...|$|E

Writing for Den of Geek, Simon Brew felt that [...] "Something There" [...] is [...] "where {{the genius of}} music as storytelling kicks in." [...] In Brew's opinion, the [...] "utterly convincing and un-mawkish" [...] song works [...] "because the two characters aren't on screen singing directly at each other." [...] Brew concluded, [...] "Everyone who makes an animated film that has a love story at the heart should watch this." [...] Filmtracks.com described [...] "Something There" [...] as an [...] "affable" [...] song. Particularly praising Ashman's songwriting, Charles Solomon of the Los Angeles Times wrote that [...] "Ashman's songs advance the plot by exploring the characters' emotions and making story points more concisely than conventional exposition." [...] Solomon concluded, [...] "By {{the end of the}} deceptively simple-sounding 'Something There,' the audience understands what Belle and Beast feel and how disconcerting those emotions seem."

500|$|Beyond Star Treks fictional innovations, its {{contributions}} to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While {{more common in}} subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one. In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told {{there was a big}} fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking towards me with this big <b>grin</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face.

Although the police protect Claridge, the Joker had poisoned him before making his announcement and Claridge dies with a ghastly <b>grin</b> <b>on</b> <b>his</b> face; Batman eventually defeats him, sending him to prison. The Joker commits whimsical, brutal crimes for reasons that, in Batman's words, [...] "make sense to him alone". Detective Comics #168 (1951) introduced the Joker's first origin story as Red Hood: a criminal who, during his final heist, vanishes after leaping into a vat of chemicals to escape Batman. His resulting disfigurement led him to adopt the name [...] "Joker", from the playing card figure he came to resemble. The Joker's Silver-Age transformation into a figure of fun was established in 1952's [...] "The Joker's Millions". In this story the Joker is obsessed with maintaining his illusion of wealth and celebrity as a criminal folk hero, afraid to let Gotham's citizens {{know that he is}} penniless and was tricked out of his fortune. The 1970s redefined the character as a homicidal psychopath. [...] "The Joker's Five-Way Revenge" [...] has the Joker taking violent revenge on the former gang members who betrayed him; in [...] "The Laughing Fish" [...] the character chemically adds his face to Gotham's fish (hoping to profit from a copyright), killing bureaucrats who stand in his way.|$|E

[...] A reviewer for TV Central wrote, [...] "There's no doubt in anyone's mind that Sebastian's previous 'Memphis' record has inspired him like no other. From the first beat of his new album, it screams soul. It's bold, brash, but it works — it really works. It's {{probably one of the most}} cohesive albums from Sebastian to date. Listening from start to finish, you truly feel like you’ve experienced a musical journey.
