5000|$|Hello. My name is Andrew Fink, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Giuliani, at {{a recent}} NRA convention, you stated that it's every American's right to be secure. Yet, on March 21 of the year 2000, The Boston Globe quoted you as saying, [...] "Anyone wanting to own a gun should have to pass a written exam." [...] Considering the Constitution grants us {{the right to bear}} arms as a means of protection, why do you believe that {{citizens}} should be required to pass an exam in order to exercise their right to protect themselves and their families? Thank you.|$|E

As well as: Why don’t you ratify the Rome Statute while acknowledging the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court as the precondition for this international dialogue that you have mentioned in your speech. Or {{do you think that you}} are going to avoid the international justice for the war crimes and crimes against humanity? Thank you". https://www.securityconference.de/en/ ...|$|E

40|$|Sixteen year-old Ismael {{walks into}} an {{energetic}} and bustling group of elementary-school aged boys and girls, puts his whistle {{to his mouth}} and gives one short, but decisive tweet. “OK, gather around for the huddle. ” Twelve boys and girls promptly scamper over and sit in a circle and are joined by Ismael and another teenager also wearing a neat blue tennis shirt emblazoned with “Coach. ” “Coach DeWayne and I are happy to see you today. Before we begin playing, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> <b>for</b> you. What does being a good sport mean to you? ” Coach Ismael and Coach DeWayne listen intently as each of the players shares an idea. They ask follow-up questions like, ‘How do you think it feels if your opponent celebrates too much after scoring a basket? ” Off to the side and listening intently to the conversation is a red-shirted graduate student from Smith College. Coach Greg—who is a former college basketball player from Haverford College – nods enthusiastically and gives DeWayne a thumbs-up signal as DeWayne skillfully elicits responses. After each of the elementary-aged players offers a thought, Coach DeWayne claps his hands, points to a 30 ’ square demarcated by orange cones and says, “OK—everybody grab a basketball. There is the ocean. You are fishies—Coach Ismael and I are sharks. You know the game—LET’S GO! ” In an instant the elementary-aged students are tearing around the court chased by their teenage coaches. DeWayne, Ismael, and Greg work i...|$|E
