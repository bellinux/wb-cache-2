25|$|Then, {{during a}} storm, the camp catches fire. Jayfeather, Lionblaze, Hollyleaf, and Squirrelflight are trapped. Squirrelflight makes {{it through the}} flames and drags a stick through {{in an attempt to}} save her kits, but needs some help. Ashfur leaps in and drags it all the way through. Just as Lionblaze leaps on, though, Ashfur blocks the way. Squirrelflight begs him to let them through, but Ashfur tells her and the other three that he never forgave her after she left him for Brambleclaw. He said that he will now kill her kits in another attempt to hurt her. Squirrelflight then reveals a crucial secret: that he cannot hurt <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because they are not her kits. She {{explains}} how she kept the secret from Brambleclaw and the whole of ThunderClan. Ashfur lets them live, but he threatens to tell her secret, and she is shocked that Ashfur would betray her like this. Knowing this, Jayfeather, Hollyleaf and Lionblaze realize they are not the Three since they are not the kin of Firestar.|$|E
25|$|Mai's role is more {{prominent}} in the anime. Early in the season she had problems with constantly moving; because she thought everyone hated her after making friends and then abandoning them, she became so depressed that she refused to go to school. She understood {{the impact of their}} journeys on others, but unlike Ai, did not have the maturity to cope with it. Early on in the series she makes friends with a classmate of hers, Konami. When it was time for Mai to leave, Konami helped convince Mai that she was wrong and in consolation Konami left a sketch portrait of Mai she made for a class assignment as a departing gift stating that they will remain friends forever, even if they never see each other again. While waiting for Mai's return, Konami passes away two years before the mansion is in a location where the two could meet again. Later in the series, Mai meets Konami's daughter; she initially mistakes her for Konami but quickly learns her name is Mai and that she was named by Konami in memory of her friend. Mai discovers that Konami's daughter has more in common with her than a name: she, like her namesake, feels that everyone hates her. As a result, Mai feels it her duty to both Konami and her daughter to show <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> of thinking was wrong, just as Konami did for her. Mai ultimately gave up and failed at the time when she Konami had still been waiting for her even as she lay dying. This, compounded with Keith's words about the pain the girls bring to others, reawakening her depression in a much deeper manner. When she returns to visit Konami later and leaves, as a departing request, asks Konami to explain to her daughter what she felt so that she would not follow the same path as the younger sister Mai. Along with Mea, the maid, Mai is left at one point when the mansion disappears into the future without them. It is during this time that Mai realizes that she cannot age and Ai explains the connection to the mansion and aging process. Mai is voiced by Mio Oukawa in the visual novel; in the anime she is voiced in Japanese by Masumi Asano and in English by Nicole Bouma.|$|E
500|$|Code: Veronica {{producer}} Shinji Mikami said [...] "Claire {{became a}} lot tougher than I Imagined. I thought she should look the same, but the game director made <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because she had such an experience in Resident Evil 2, she could handle any situation now!" [...] For Revelations 2, the now hardened and aggressive Claire was redesigned to be a contrasting character to the young, immature and easily scared Moira Burton, who {{was defined as a}} purely supporting character, and they both serve different roles in the story and have different functions. Producer Michiteru Okabe said: [...] "Really, only after did we look back and say, 'Oh, I guess they are both girls.' Which is good, because it means we’re treating them as whole characters and not just as their gender. What we settled on is the idea that you have different roles -- it isn’t two against the world, it’s one against the world with a helper." [...] Okabe also said the game's writer Dai Satō [...] "is a big fan of her personally" [...] {{which was one of the}} factors that led to Claire's return.|$|E

[...] "I make prophecy {{you will}} never win <b>'er</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> No. Not thees woman. She mus' be played along an' then keessed, this charming, delicious little creature. One kees! An' then you 'ave her." [...] Again he {{displayed}} his unpleasant teeth. [...] "I make you a bet I will kees her--" ...|$|R

500|$|Starting {{to appear}} more frequently, Dotty became a {{recurring}} character. Santer told Digital Spy in May 2009 that Dotty's storyline would go [...] "to a very, very dark place!" [...] He {{questioned whether the}} character was born bad or if her father had made <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way,</b> and if she could be more dangerous than Nick. As the storyline between Dot, Dotty and Nick progressed, Nick's true agenda was revealed when he blackmailed his mother into giving him money for custody of Dotty. A BBC source told The Sun, [...] " [...] horrified when Nick tells her Dotty is for sale. He shows no emotion and his evil grin sends shivers down her spine. She always knew Nick would sell his soul {{for the price of}} some pick ’n mix but she had no idea he’d sell his own daughter." [...] In a further plot twist, it was revealed to the audience in 2009, that Dotty was colluding with her father all along. The plot climaxed in June 2009 and marked Altman's departure from the show for the fourth time. Dotty later left on 23 February 2010.|$|E
2500|$|In Victor Fleming's comedy-triangle, Mantrap, Bow, as Alverna the manicurist, cures lonely hearts Joe Easter (Ernest Torrence), of {{the great}} northern, as well as pill-popping New York divorce {{attorney}} runaway Ralph Prescott (Percy Marmont). Bow commented: [...] "(Alverna)...was bad in the book, but—darn it!—of course, they couldn't make <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> in the picture. So I played her as a flirt." [...] The film was released on July 24, 1926.|$|E
2500|$|Hilary Duff is the self-titled third studio album by American singer Hilary Duff. It was {{released}} on September 29, 2004, shortly after her seventeenth birthday, by Hollywood Records. Duff cited the album as being more mature than her previous albums, stating [...] "Basically, I'm not Lizzie McGuire anymore". The seventeen-track album saw Duff collaborating with the same producers she did on Metamorphosis, {{saying that it was}} more comfortable for <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> Recording sessions for the album took place during May to August 2004, partially between filming of Raise Your Voice (2004) and The Perfect Man (2005), both in which Duff had starring roles.|$|E

2500|$|After Burns was released, she {{was quickly}} rearrested for {{continuing}} protests, picketing, and marching at the White House. Upon her third arrest in 1917, the judge aimed {{to make an}} example of Burns, and she was given the maximum sentence. [...] Once again a prisoner at Occoquan Workhouse, Lucy Burns endured what is remembered as the “Night of Terror.” The women were treated brutally and were refused medical attention. To unite the women, Burns tried to call roll and refused to stop despite numerous threats by the guards. When they realized Lucy Burns's spirit {{was not going to}} be easily broken, they handcuffed her hands above her head to her cell door and left <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> for the entire night. Burns was so loved and respected by her fellow suffragists that the women in the cell across from her held their hands above their head and stood in the same position. Despite her courage and extraordinary leadership skills, the burden of working so diligently did bother Burns at times; she once told Alice Paul, “I am so nervous I cannot eat or sleep. I am such a coward I ought to be a village seamstress, instead of a Woman’s Party organizer.” ...|$|E

6000|$|Miss Tita {{added in}} a moment, {{as if she had}} guessed this and were sorry for me, {{but at the same time}} wished to explain that I did drive her on or at least did insist too much: [...] "I can't deceive <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> I can't deceive her--perhaps on her deathbed." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{should want}} your money first!"

60|$|Then {{his words}} of gladness at sight of her, his chagrin at not {{being at the}} train to welcome her, were not so memorable of him as the way he clasped her, for he had held <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> the day he left home, and she had not forgotten.
