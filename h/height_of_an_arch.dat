50|$|The {{anatomy and}} shape <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person’s {{longitudinal}} and transverse arch can dictate {{the types of}} injuries that person is susceptible to. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> person’s <b>arch</b> {{is determined by the}} <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the navicular bone. Collapse of the longitudinal arches results in what is known as flat feet. A person with <b>a</b> low longitudinal <b>arch,</b> or flat feet will likely stand and walk with their feet in a pronated position, where the foot everts or rolls inward. This makes the person susceptible to heel pain, arch pain and plantar fasciitis. Flat footed people may also have more difficulty performing exercises that require supporting their weight on their toes.|$|R

The main results in this note show that, in a commutative Noetherian Krasner hyperring, the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> minimal prime hyperideal over a proper hyperideal generated by n elements is {{less than or equal to}} n, the converse of this claim being also true.
