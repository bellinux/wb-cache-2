40|$|Vegetation {{in natural}} desert and agro-ecosystems was {{investigated}} in the middle sector of Egypt. The vegetation was classified by the Two Way Indicator Species Analysis technique (TWINSPAN) into nine vegetational groups representing seven habitat types: desert, fallow land, winter crops of old cultivated land, summer crops of old cultivated land, Citrus orchards, winter crops of reclaimed land, and summer crops of reclaimed land. Detrended Canonical Correspondence Analysis (DCCA) demonstrates that soil factors especially soil texture, CaCO 3, organic carbon and electric conductivity contribute significantly to the distribution of species. In all <b>habitat</b> <b>types,</b> <b>species</b> diversity is higher in winter than in summer season.

40|$|Abstract Variation in {{movement}} ability by insects {{among different}} non-habitat (matrix) types may {{have important implications}} for both metapopulation dynamics and weed biocontrol practices. We used a mark-recapture experi-ment to explore the effects of two different matrix habitats (grass vs shrub) on the ability of two species of Aphthona (Chrysomelidae: Coleoptera) flea beetle to immigrate to patches of the invasive weed, leafy spurge. Using general-ized linear models, we compared effects of the matrix <b>habitat</b> <b>types,</b> <b>species</b> and sex on observed immigration probabilities. Our analyses demonstrated that one species (A. nigriscutis) had a much higher immigration probability when moving through a grass-dominated matrix than a shrub-dominated matrix whereas immigration probabili-ties for the second species (A. lacertosa) were similar in both matrix habitats but significantly lower overall than for A. nigriscutis. Furthermore, A. nigriscutis females were more likely to immigrate to spurge patches embed-ded in a grass matrix than in shrub, whereas the opposite occurred for males. Our results suggest that metapopula-tion dynamics may be strongly affected by the type(s) of matrix habitat present on a landscape. These effects also suggest that release strategies for weed biocontrol should be tailored according to the structure of the landscape into which releases are planned. In addition, even closely re-lated species can have significantly different movement abilities which will also affect release strategies...|$|E
40|$|Aliwal Shoal is a subtropical, algal-dominated reef in {{a marine}} {{protected}} area located south of Durban, South Africa. The shoal has historically been heavily utilized by fishermen and SCUBA divers. In this study, a survey was undertaken to describe and zone the reef and its benthic communities in terms of topography, <b>habitat</b> <b>types,</b> <b>species</b> diversity, species richness and benthic cover. Data were collected using underwater photography and analysed by point intercept analysis. Three distinct benthic communities were identified using multivariate non-metric statistics. Benthic communities appeared {{to be influenced by}} topography, sediment cover and wave energy. The highest abundance of zooxanthellate hard corals and the encrusting zooxanthellate sponge, Suberites kelleri were found on the large shallow areas of the shoal. This suggested that light penetration to the elevated areas on the reef was adequate for photosynthesis and {{played a role in the}} distribution of its biota. The encrusting morphology of the sponge   Suberites kelleri, and the branching morphology of the hard corals Stylophora pistillata and Pocillopora spp., appeared to be tolerant of the high-energy environment near the surface. A second community was found only on steep edges of the Shoal and was characterized by a large abundance of Polychaeta and the soft coral Eleutherobia aurea, while a third community was found deeper on the offshore side of the shoal and consisted primarily of coralline and red foliose algae. </strong...|$|E

40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a study on the}} terrestrial small mammal communities (< 1 kg) in the Volcanoes National Park (VNP), Rwanda, to determine species diversity and altitudinal/habitat associations. Data on environmental variables (habitat cover, temperature, wind speed and rainfall) were incorporated into the analysis. Both Sherman live and snap traps were set in transects from 30 September to 8 November 2009 at eight habitats (ranging from 2380 m to 3710 m). Trapping over 4800 trap nights resulted in the capture of 305 individuals (including 4 recaptures), of which 247 were identified to species level. These represented eight species of rodents, three species of shrews and one mongoose. Total numbers of small mammals were high in brush ridge and herbaceous habitats, and low in alpine and bamboo habitats. The midaltitude zone housed a high number of small mammals. Of the species captured, Praomys degraaffi is vulnerable and Sylvisorex vulcanorum is near threatened (IUCN 2009); six species (Hylomyscus vulcanorum, Mus bufo, Praomys degraaffi, Sylvisorex vulcanorum, Lophuromys woosnami and Trachyoryctes ruandae) are endemic to the Albertine rift; and four species are new to the Park list. Species richness varied significantly among the different <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Species</b> richness and diversity increased with elevation up to the middle altitudes (2860 - 3255 m) and then declined with increasing elevation. Endemic species were found mainly in low and middle attitude habitats, and thus, these habitat types are important for conservation of small mammals at VNP. The numbers of known small mammal endemics for VNP will probably be increased if trapping is done seasonally and a more diverse regime of trapping techniques is employed.

40|$|More {{than two-thirds}} of Australia is {{classified}} as arid or semi arid and receives less than 500 mm of rain annually. Throughout these arid areas, rivers and drainage lines (which often have their catchments in higher rainfall areas) act as arteries for vast amounts of water to flow into these dry landscapes. Many inland rivers, including the Paroo, Bulloo and Cooper Creeks, have highly variable flow rates and can go many years with very little or no flow. As {{a result of the}} hydrology of these areas, they contain different soil characteristics and vegetation communities from the surrounding arid landscapes. For example, soil nutrients are thought to be higher along drainage lines and on floodplains due to sediment deposition and decomposition of organic material. Also, vegetation in these areas needs to not only survive drought conditions (as a plant or propogule), but also periodic inundation and flood events. These characteristics are thought to make these areas more productive than the surrounding arid lanscapes and are thought to be important habitats for flora and fauna. There has been much debate over the importance of riparian corridors to vertebrate species. Several studies internationally in mesic areas have suggested that riparian corridors contain higher levels of biodiversity than the surrounding habitats, although this pattern is not replicated in all areas or for all taxonomic groups. Many of these studies suggest that the difference in biodiversity between riparian areas and adjacent habitats should be greater in xeric areas where the habitat differences between these areas are greatest. Other studies have suggested that diversity is not necessarily greater but riparian areas are important habitats for different species and may act as a refuge for some species. In Australia, very few studies have been conducted on the importance of riparian corridors to vertebrates in arid areas, despite these habitats being under threat from grazing, flow alteration and flow diversion. In this study I examined the role of the Field River in the Simpson Desert as a potential refuge for vertebrate species and compared diversity and population dynamics of vertebrates at dune and riverine sites. Specifically this study aimed to: 1) determine if species richness of vertebrates along the Field River was greater in riverine ecosystems than the surrounding dune habitats; 2) quantify how the riverine habitats differed in terms of floristics, vegetation complexity, soils and water availability from the surrounding landscapes; 3) determine the dynamics of terrestrial vertebrate populations along the Field River; and 4) determine if the abundance, diversity and demographics of small vertebrate populations along the Field River was different from populations in the sand dune fields on a broader landscape scale. These questions were examined on Ethabuka Station in the Simpson Desert, Queensland, from 2006 to 2008. The riparian corridor along the Field River was found to have a range of characteristics that make it unique from the surrounding dune habitats. Soils along the riverine corridor were found to be characterised by more than 20 % clay while soils on the dune crest were characterised by no more than 5 % clay. Further, soil carbon and nitrogen was significantly higher in the riverine corridor than in the dune habitats and decreased with distance from the catchment. Spinifex (Triodia basedowii) cover was low in the corridor but dominated the dune swale. Number of trees and cover by trees and non-spinifex grasses were also significantly higher in the riverine corridor when compared to the surrounding dunes. Following the rainfall, annual cover was also significantly greater and they persisted much longer than in the dunes. There was very little difference in the diversity or number of invertebrates between the different <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b> <b>Species</b> richness was estimated to be highest (48 species) in the riverine centre and lowest in the floodplain (30 species). The riverine habitats had different species pools when compared to the dune habitats. Several species including Amphibolurus longirostris and Litoria rubella exclusively inhabited the riverine habitats while others such as the skinks Ctenotus ariadnae and Ctenotus dux were captured only in the dune habitats. Results from a Canonical Correspondence Analysis suggest that the distribution of some species in arid areas, such as the introduced House Mouse (Mus musculus), may be correlated with habitat characteristics associated with the riverine corridor, e. g. soil moisture or high annual cover. Abundance, body condition and reproduction of mammals along the Field River was generally driven by time. On a local scale, habitat had little effect on the abundance of the Sandy Inland Mouse (Pseudomys hermannsburgensis) and Lesser Hairy-footed Dunnart (Sminthopsis youngsoni), although M. musculus showed some preference for the riverine corridor. Abundance and reproduction of both rodent species increased following rainfall while S. youngsoni abundance was strongly seasonal with increases in abundance in autumn and winter. More than 45 % of all captures were reptiles and this group was the most diverse and conspicuous fauna group along the riverine corridor. Abundance of the two most common lizard species, the Military Dragon (Ctenophorus isolepis) and Central-netted Dragons (Ctenophorus nuchalis), was significantly affected by time, with the abundance of both species decreasing dramatically 12 months after rainfall, possibly due to increased predation. Abundance of the Beaked Gecko, Rhynchoedura ornata, began to decrease prior to rainfall, suggesting a factor other than habitat structure or food availability causing the decline. The skink, Lerista labialis, showed strong seasonal trends in abundance and body condition, which suggested that within the desert riverine corridor the species was not reliant on rain-induced changes in food availability. To compare the effect of habitat on species richness, composition and population dynamics at a regional scale, sites along the riparian corridor were compared with dune sites located 500 m to 45 km from the Field River. On this scale, species species richness varied spatially with only one of the riverine sites having higher estimated species richness than the dune sites. Species turnover was greater in riverine sites despite the habitat data suggesting that primary production in these sites was more stable. Some species were able to persist at riverine sites at all times of the year but were only present in the community at dune sites following rainfall, suggesting that the riverine sites may be a more stable habitat for some species. Composition analysis revealed that dune and riverine habitats contain different communities, and some species, particularly Amphibolurus longirostris and Litoria rubella, probably rely on the river for their habitat requirements. Population dynamics including abundance, reproduction and body condition of seven species were compared between dune and riverine habitats. Only four, M. musculus, L. labialis, C. nuchalis and S. youngsoni, showed any significant affect of habitat on abundance. Abundance of C. nuchalis, S. youngsoni and L. labialis were generally more abundant in the dune habitats although the affect was only significant for some sampling sessions. The only species that was significantly more abundant in the riverine habitats than dune habitats was the introduced M. musculus. This species appears to be reliant on the riverine corridor, only appearing commonly in the dune habitats following rainfall. For most species, the number of juveniles captured increased following the rainfall in January 2007 but only in C. nuchalis and P. hermannsburgensis was there any significant difference between habitat types. For both species, generally more juveniles were captured in the dune habitats than in the riverine habitats. This study provided information {{on the role of the}} Field River to vertebrate fauna on Ethabuka Station. Although, the study focused only on one ephemeral desert river, it could be considered representative of similar desert rivers such as the Hay, Plenty and Hale rivers further west in central Australia. The riverine corridor did represent a different habitat to the surrounding sand dunes, and some characteristics, such as greater soil moisture, soil nutrients and annual cover, suggest that it may have greater and more stable primary production. Although the species studied did not generally have greater abundance and body condition, or reproduce more in the riverine corridor, many species including the Long-nosed Dragon (Amphibolurus longirostris), Desert Tree Frog (Litoria rubella) and Pygmy Mulga Monitor (Varanus gilleni) are likely to rely on the habitat that the riverine corridor provides. With expanding human populations placing greater pressure on rivers around the world, particularly in arid areas, it is imperative that we understand the ecology of these riparian systems so that effective management and conservation strategies can be developed...|$|E

Additionally, comparisons of the effect of <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> and <b>species</b> are largely missing. Methodology and Principal Findings: We estimated the importance of the <b>habitat</b> <b>type</b> and <b>species</b> for population dynamics of plants. Specifically, we compared the dynamics of two closely related species, the allotetraploid species Anthericum liliago and the diploid species Anthericum ramosum, occurring in the same <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> We also compared the dynamics of A. ramosum in two contrasting habitats. We examined three populations per <b>species</b> and <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> The results showed that single life history traits as well as the mean population dynamics of A. liliago and A. ramosum from the same <b>habitat</b> <b>type</b> were more similar than the population dynamics of A. ramosum from the two contrasting habitats. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that when transferring knowledge regarding population dynamics between populations, we need to take habitat conditions into account, as these conditions appear to be more important than the species involved (ploidy level). However, the two species differ significantly in their overall population growth rates, indicating that the ploidy level has an effect on species performance. In contrast to what has been suggested by previous studies, we observed a higher population growth rate in the diploid species.

40|$|Background and purpose. Species traits {{have been}} {{extensively}} used by botanists to describe, group and rank species {{according to their}} functions. Recently, the multi-trait approach has been extended also to the animal assemblages. There is now growing evidence that interspecific traits-variability can have significant effects on community dynamics and ecosystem functioning. The aim of our study was to describe how the carabid species traits change in relation to an altitudinal sequence of <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b>   Materials and methods. In this paper we weighted the species traits (dispersal power, diet, reproductive rhythm, chorology) of the Carabid beetles assemblages in nineteen sites in the Dolomites along an altitudinal sequence of <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> (1000 - 2250 m a. s. l.). Carabids have been sampled by means of pitfall traps.   Results. Species richness, activity density and species traits were not, or weakly, correlated with elevation, while they showed {{to be linked to}} the <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> <b>Species</b> traits, as taxa, showed to be not uniformly distributed along the sequence, with brachypterous species concentrated in high-altitude or climax environments mainly, and regional endemic species prevailing in high-altitude environments.

The species traits analysis enabled us to shift the research focus from the taxonomic level to a biological more comprehensive level, opening the way for drawing more general ecologic models.

Different <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> are also characterized by different phylogenetic clades.

We investigated whether species pools in contemporary <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> represent different levels of diversification of angiosperms and, if so, whether these differences correlate with particular environmental factors. We tested these relationships in a region of recent geological origin possessing a comparatively young flora, and compared the result with standard analyses of species diversity. Location The Netherlands. Methods We studied angiosperms across the full range of <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> present in the Netherlands. We characterized levels of diversification represented in species pools within each of these <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> with respect to (1) taxonomic diversification, i. e. the rate of increase of richness across taxonomic ranks (relative to a null expectation for a given species richness), and (2) cladogenic diversification, i. e. the average cladogenic distance of species from the root of a phylogenetic tree of the species pool within a given region. Results Species pools of different <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> represented different levels of taxonomic and cladogenic diversification. These differences were strongly correlated with the environmental characteristics of the <b>habitat</b> <b>type.</b> Greater levels of taxonomic diversification were represented in the species pools of relatively dry and open <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b> Greater levels of cladogenic diversification were represented in habitats with both dry and weakly acidic soils.

According to Bernardet et al., Flavobacteriia are gram-negative aerobic rods, 2 - 5 µm long, 0.3 - 0.5 µm wide, with rounded or tapered ends that are motile by gliding, yellow (cream to orange) colonies on agar, decompose several polysaccharides but not cellulose, G+C contents of 32 - 37%, and are widely distributed in soil and freshwater <b>habitats.</b> The <b>type</b> <b>species</b> is F. aquatile.|$|R
40|$|Anthropogenic {{nitrogen}} deposition {{has been}} recognized as a factor affecting the dynamics and composition of plant communities. Its impact on insect communities is still largely unknown. Using data from the Dutch Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, we analyzed the variation in local trends of butterfly abundance in three Natura 2000 <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> of known sensitivity to nitrogen deposition: coastal dunes (H 2130), wet heathlands (H 4010 A) and species-rich Nardus grassland (H 6230). We found evidence of a negative impact of increasing levels of nitrogen deposition on butterfly trends in all three <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b> Interestingly, <b>species</b> from more nitrogen-rich habitats showed a similar, though less pronounced, response. The results constitute the first evidence of a significant dose-response relationship between nitrogen deposition and declines in insect abundance at a national scale...|$|R
50|$|These {{multifaceted}} landscapes are host to a {{wide variety}} of flora and fauna. The main natural habitats are reedbeds, tall herbs, peaty woods, meadows, ditches and rivers. The many species of flora include aquatic vegetation, such as flowered rush (Butomus umbellatus), Greater Spearwort (Ranunculus lingua) and marsh fern (Thelypteris palustris), as well as underwater and floating vegetation. These <b>habitat</b> <b>types</b> enable many <b>species</b> of birds to breed, feed and rest.|$|R
40|$|Ikh Nart Nature Reserve remains poorly {{studied for}} invertebrates, {{especially}} for vespid wasps. A total of 14 vespid species belonging to seven genera of the subfamily Eumeninae were recorded from diff erent habitats (rocky outcrops, springs, tall vegetation habitats, shrub-lands and short grass steppes) {{in the nature}} reserve during three-year studies (2015 - 2017). These species represent 27 percent of the vespid fauna of the desert-steppe zone of Mongolia. We found the highest species richness in areas where water was available (near springs and wells), and the lowest richness in habitats with tall vegetation. Among the diff erent <b>habitat</b> <b>types,</b> vespid <b>species</b> composition was most similar (91...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{relative}} frequency {{of wind and}} animal pollinated plants is non-randomly distributed across the globe and numerous hypotheses have been raised for the greater occurrence of wind pollination in some habitats and towards higher latitudes. To date, however, {{there has been no}} comprehensive global investigation of these hypotheses. Aims: Investigating a range of hypotheses for the role of biotic and abiotic factors as determinants of the global variation in animal versus wind pollination. Methods: We analysed 67 plant communities ranging from 70 º North to 34 º South. For these we determined <b>habitat</b> <b>type,</b> <b>species</b> richness, insularity, topographic heterogeneity, current climate and Late-Quaternary climate change. The predictive effects of these factors on the proportion of wind- and animal-pollinated plants were tested using correlations, ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression analyses with information-theoretic model selection. Results: The proportion of animal-pollinated plant species was positively associated with plant species richness and current temperature. Furthermore, in forest, animal pollination was positively related to precipitation. Historical climate was only weakly and idiosyncratically correlated with animal pollination. Conclusion: Results were consistent with the hypothesised reduced chance for wind-transported pollen reaching conspecific flowers in species-rich communities, fewer constraints on nectar production in warm and wet habitats, and reduced relative effectiveness of wind dispersal in humid areas. There was little evidence of a legacy of historical climate change affecting these patterns...|$|R
40|$|Rivers are dynamic {{ecosystems}} {{with considerable}} heterogeneity across multiple spatial scales. Environmental factors, such as depth, physical structure, flow regime and habitat connectivity influence species distributions across a floodplain, and subsequently {{there is a}} large body of work focused on understanding how these factors influence the structure of fish communities. There has also been increasing interest in understanding how environmental variation influences the community structure of another major aquatic vertebrate group, the turtles. I sampled fish and turtles at Gus Engeling Wildlife Management Area (WMA) and used ordination analyses to visualize environmental gradients that may influence community structure for these two vertebrate groups. Distributions of aquatic turtles and fishes at Gus Engeling WMA were associated with environmental gradients defined by flow regimes and substrate composition. When just turtles were considered, flow regimes were particularly important in describing habitat partitioning among species, particularly confamilial groups. A second study site, Keechi Creek WMA, was sampled for turtles in 2009. Keechi Creek WMA exhibited less habitat heterogeneity than Gus Engeling WMA, and as heterogeneity decreased between the two study sites, turtle species richness decreased, whereas habitat overlap between species increased. I analyzed the capture efficiency of 7 trap types used throughout the course of this project and found that effectiveness of each trap <b>type</b> varied by <b>habitat</b> <b>type,</b> <b>species,</b> and shell size. So, using a diversity of trap types increased my overall trapping success...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 714 small mammals {{representing}} 15 species was captured, identified and released (11, 000 trap nights at 110 different trap sites in six different <b>habitat</b> <b>types)</b> at the Tallgrass Prairie Preserve, Osage Co., Oklahoma. More species of small mammals {{were trapped in}} the prairie-grass habitat (13 species) than in disturbed areas (9 species), grassy streamsides (7 species), wooded streamsides (6 species), rock outcrops (6 species), or upland woods (6 species) habitats. Species diversity and evenness indices (Shannon's Index) of small mammals were determined for six <b>habitat</b> <b>types.</b> Mean <b>species</b> diversity values ranged from a high value in the prairie-grass habitat, to low values in the upland woods and wooded streamsides habitats. High community similarity (Horn's Index) was found in upland woods and wooded streamsides habitats. Community similarity also was high among prairie-grass, rock outcrops, grassy streamsides, and disturbed habitats. © 1999 Oklahoma Academy of Scienc...|$|R
