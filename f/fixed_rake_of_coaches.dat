50|$|Initially, the Berolina was {{operated}} using DRG Class 137 diesel {{multiple units}} (Bauart Köln). By the 1970s, these {{had been replaced}} by a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> hauled by DR Class 130 locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|The Twilight Express first ran on 18 July 1989 from Osaka to Sapporo {{and back}} as a special preview run for invited passengers. From 21 July, it began {{operating}} as a charter service. A second <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> was introduced from December 1989, allowing operation as a seasonal service. [...] "A"-type sleeping cars {{were added to the}} formations between 1990 and 1991, and the formations were extended to 10 cars (including generator car). In April 1991, a third <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> was introduced, allowing daily operations during busy seasons.

50|$|As the {{standard}} BR general-purpose diesel shunter, the class became a familiar sight at major stations and freight yards. Since their introduction, though, {{the nature of}} rail traffic in Britain has changed considerably. Freight trains are now mostly <b>fixed</b> <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> wagons, and passenger trains are mostly multiple units, neither requiring {{the attention of a}} shunting locomotive. Consequently, {{a large proportion of the}} class has been withdrawn from mainline use and stored, scrapped, exported or sold to industrial or heritage railways.|$|R

25|$|Over 80 {{years the}} coach livery {{has changed from}} all-over green to brown and cream, blue, blue and cream, green and cream, {{chocolate}} and cream, and red and cream in the late 1980s. From 2000, <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> (trains <b>of</b> around a dozen coaches) have been painted in individual liveries and there are now maroon, green, blue, crimson and teak coaches; 'Heritage' coaches are chocolate and cream.|$|R
50|$|During the 1930s, when {{competition}} from the roads became fierce and {{with the growth of}} the permission of week-long holidays and coastal resorts, trains were being operated from the North of England to the South Coast, and from and through the Midlands to other resorts on the east and west coasts. Trains usually one of the leading Big Four companies consisted <b>of</b> <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> and were hauled by locomotives that were sometimes changed when crossing from one company to another.|$|R

50|$|On the {{original}} Mark 3 DVTs, which operated on the West Coast Main Line (WCML), the {{intention was to}} use the RCH jumpers to carry the signals therefore allowing the same cables {{to be used for}} lighting and the public address system, as well as driver-guard signalling. However this proved to be very troublesome in service and eventually the <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> on the WCML were re-wired with specially screened cables exclusively for the TDM system.In addition to the driver's cab, some DVTs have luggage and cycle storage space and a guard's office.|$|R

50|$|British and European {{locomotives}} of {{this type}} tend to be {{much smaller than the}} common size in the United States. Current British shunters are 0-6-0 diesel-electrics, Class 08 and Class 09, of 350-400 horsepower. These were developed from similar locomotives supplied by the English Electric Company to the Big Four British railway companies in the 1930s and 1940s, e.g. those pioneered by the LMS. Similar locomotives were exported to the Netherlands (e.g. NS Class 600) and Australia (e.g. Victorian Railways F class (diesel)). The use of shunting locomotives saw a sharp decline in Britain {{in the latter half of}} the 20th century, largely due to the contraction of the network, increased competition from road traffic and widespread adoption of train-load freight, with <b>fixed</b> <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> wagons moving mainly bulk products between rapid-loading facilities, as opposed to thousands of sidings and goods depots feeding trains of assorted wagons into the marshalling yards.|$|R

50|$|This {{configuration}} {{remained in}} use until 1893, when Charles Park built a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> corridor <b>coaches</b> for the expresses to Edinburgh with six-wheeled bogies. This was {{first and third}} class only, although second class remained for many other services until 1911. In 1892, the non-automatic brake finally disappeared and in 1896 Stone's patent electric train lighting was introduced, along with communication cords.|$|R
50|$|The {{station was}} created as the {{terminus}} {{of the line}} {{from the end of}} the Second World War until closure in 1962. A landlslide on the section following it ensured that the line was impassable upon reopening after the war and a run-round loop installed here to facilitate the locomotive Polar Bear running around its <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches.</b> At this time steps installed to serve the headland cafe which overlooked the picturesque beach below. The loop utilised a shortened section of what had originally been an extra long passing loop installed in the early years of the twentieth century, facilitating the passing of two trains without the need for either to draw to a halt. Upon closure the lines were lifted and the site became part of a footpath.|$|R

50|$|The GDLR was {{the first}} to reach Immingham, being used by {{contractors}} to ferry men and materials from and to Grimsby, including guests for the sod cutting.

50|$|Mark 4 DVTs {{were built}} in 1988 by Metro Cammell at their Washwood Heath plant in Birmingham and were {{introduced}} to the ECML with the IC225 <b>rakes</b> <b>of</b> Mark 4 <b>coaches.</b> They operate with class 91 locomotives using the TDM system via UIC screened cables through the nine Mark 4 <b>coaches</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rake.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Scottish Region used {{a system with}} a Class 27 {{locomotive}} at each end <b>of</b> a <b>rake</b> <b>of</b> <b>coaches</b> that had been retrofitted with the necessary 'Blue Star' multiple working cables to control the remote unit; but some problems of delay in actuation were experienced. They were replaced in 1979 by {{a system in which}} a Driving Brake Standard Open (DBSO), converted from a Mark 2, could control the Class 47/7 locomotive via computerised time-division multiplex (TDM) signalling through the train lighting circuits. This had the added benefit that intermediate carriages needed no special equipment, and was found more satisfactory. Such trains became widely used on the intensive passenger service between Edinburgh Waverley and Glasgow Queen Street. When the push-pull sets were replaced by multiple units, the DBSOs were transferred to the Liverpool Street to Norwich service, where they were modified to work with Class 86 electric locomotives.|$|R
