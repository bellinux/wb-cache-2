40|$|Acid deposition, {{primarily}} {{the result of}} sulfur emissions due to fossil fuel combustion, is a serious environmental problem. Resolving the problem will impose costs measuring in the billions of dollars. Based on evidence {{that the rate of}} vet sulfate deposition in eastern North America is higher in the summer half of the year than in the vinter half of the year, seasonal control of emissions is proposed as a means of minimizing acid deposition control costs. This paper evaluates the proposal that natural gas be substituted for coal and oil in electric pover plants during April through September. A model is presented that simulates the substitution of natural gs for coal and oil in pover plants in the eastern 31 state region so as to minimize total costs with respect to deposition reductions at an Adirondack receptor. The results of the model show: 1) changes in fuel coansumption as a result of substitution, 2) the increased effectiveness of seasonal versus year-round controls. and 3) the costs of achieving various levels of deposition reductioan at an Adirondack receptor. The costs of seasonal <b>gas</b> <b>substitution.</b> in terms of emission and deposition reductions, are compared to cost estimates for other proposed control methods and strategies. An example is given that calculates the cost with respect to deposition of a source-oriented control strategy, so that the cost of seasonal <b>gas</b> <b>substitution</b> can be fairly compared with it. The conclusion of these cost comparisons is that seasonal <b>gas</b> <b>substitution</b> is cost-competitive vith some other control methods. at least in some states. Thesis (M. S.)

Possible effects of soil properties on the bias of the AIT-derived SDP have not been thoroughly investigated yet. The study presented here therefore aimed at quantifying the relationships between soil texture and nutrient contents and the bias of AIT-derived SDP. A total of 26 soils {{with a wide range}} of clay and nutrient contents were incubated according to the standard procedure of AIT for assaying SDP. Incubation flasks were made anaerobic by <b>gas</b> <b>substitution</b> with pure helium (99. 999 %). Changes in the N- 2 and N 2 O concentrations in the He headspace were measured using gas chromatography. The emission rates of N 2 O and N- 2 were calculated to quantify the bias of the AIT-derived SDP (expressed as the percentage of the actual SDP that was not accounted for by AIT). The results showed that the bias ranged from 8 to 98 %. The bias was negatively correlated (P < 0. 05) with the clay, silt, organic matter and nutrient contents of the soils. These results indicate that the bias of the AIT-derived SDP was higher in low-fertility soils than in fertile soils. We recommend that soil properties are taken into account when interpreting results of AIT-derived SDP values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of its rapid {{economic}} development and large volume of coal burning, China is faced with serious coal-smoke pollution in urban areas. In large cities such as Beijing and Chongqing, people are clearly suffering the adverse health effects of coal-smoke pollution, with PM- 10 and SO 2 as the main pollutants. Natural gas, although not the dominant energy source in China, is becoming one of the most attractive clean substitutes for coal. On one hand, there is widespread disagreement and doubt about the rationale for burning natural gas instead of using it as a raw material in the chemical industry. On the other hand, the economic advantages of natural gas over clean-coal technology are crucial in deciding whether to promote the use of natural gas as a fuel. This research has four goals: Firstly, it quantifies the health damage caused by air pollution, particularly coal burining, in Beijing and Chongqing. Secondly, it explores the rationale behind using natural gas for municipal (residential and commercial) energy production through two comparison studies: (a) using natural gas as clean fuel versus using it as a chemical industry raw material, and (b) using natural gas versus clean coal technology. Thirdly, it performs a cost-benefit analysis of urban natural <b>gas</b> <b>substitution</b> projects in Beijing and Chongqing.

40|$|A {{dual fuel}} engine is an {{internal}} combustion engine where the primary gaseous fuel source is pre-mixed with air as it enters the combustion chamber. This homogenous air fuel mixture is ignited by a small quantity of diesel known as the ‘pilot’ that is injected {{towards the end of}} the compression stroke. The diesel fuel ignites in the same way as in compression ignition (CI) engines, and the gaseous fuel is consumed by flame propagation in a similar manner to spark ignited engines. The motivation to dual-fuel a CI engine is partly economic due to the lower cost of the primary fuel, and partly environmental as some emissions characteristics are improved. In the present study, a direct injection four cylinder CI engine, typically used in genset applications, was fuelled with three different gaseous fuels; methane, propane and butane. The performance and emissions (NOx and smoke) 	characteristics	of	various	gaseous concentrations were recorded at 1500 rpm (synchronous speed) and at 1 ⁄ 4, 1 ⁄ 2, and 3 ⁄ 4 load.

Use of oil residues and bitumen can be a cost-effective solution for natural <b>gas</b> <b>substitution</b> in SAGD (Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage). However, use of such fuels gives rise to higher specific GHG emissions. Oxy-combustion technology is an elegant {{solution to this problem}} since oxygen allows complete combustion of very high viscosity and heavy fuels, and because it provides a concentrated CO 2 stream, for easier Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS). Air Liquide has acquired {{over the last two decades}} extensive industrial experience of full oxy-combustion for the glass, metals, cement and waste treatment industries. This expertise and extensive scientific knowledge have been used to develop an innovative oxy-burner technology, specific to steam and power production applications. This oxy-burner technology presents novel and differentiating features, which will be described in this paper. In particular, it features a direct oxygen injection into the burner, without external mixing of oxygen with the flue gas recycle, which provides additional flue gas recycle rate flexibility, and enables a safe handling of the oxygen. Air Liquide has demonstrated the performance of this oxy-burner concept through downscaled (1  MW) oxy- combustion tests in a dedicated cold-wall test-rig with flue gas recycle.

In these smaller capacity high speed engines, where the combustion event can be temporally shorter, the injection timing can have an important effect on the performance and emissions characteristics of the engine. This paper discusses the use of a 0. 51 -litre single-cylinder high speed direct injection diesel engine modified to achieve port directed gas injection. The effect of pilot diesel injection timing on dual fuel engine performance and emissions was investigated at engine speeds of 1500 and 2500 rpm and loads equivalent to 0. 15, 0. 3, 0. 45 and 0. 6 MPa gross indicated mean effective pressure, for a fixed <b>gas</b> <b>substitution</b> ratio (on an energy basis) of 50 %.

Furthermore, pilot injection timing and quantity were shown to have fundamental effects on the formation and emission of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide and total hydrocarbons. The potential for dual fuel combustion to achieve significant reductions in specific CO 2 was also highlighted, with reductions of up to 30 % being achieved at full load compared to the baseline diesel case...|$|E

If a high permit price boosts the demand for natural <b>gas</b> through <b>substitution</b> from more polluting fuels and thus increase gas profits, this may increase the incentives to exert monopoly power in the permit market. Moreover, a large fossil fuel exporter may use its market position to influence the effective demand for permits. Hence, the relationship between permit income and fossil fuels exports runs in both directions. In this article, we explore the interdependence between the revenues from permit and fossil fuel exports both theoretically and numerically. A computable general equilibrium model suggests the fact that Russia as a big gas exporter has small effect on the incentives to exert monopoly power in the permit market.

The retrofit is by integration of a solid biomass combustor with the bottoming cycle of a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plant, to form a Hybrid Combined Cycle (HCC). The motivation {{is the need to}} find efficient options for substitution of natural gas by biomass to meet the imminent need to reduce C 02 emissions as well as improve security of supply in the utility power sector, which in some regions is heavily dependent on power generation from rather new CCGT plants. The work is based on process simulations using an existing 600 MWfuel combined heat and power CCGT plant (commissioned 2006) as reference. It is shown that the HCC retrofit only yields a minor decrease in plant efficiency; electric efficiency (ηe) of 43. 3 %, compared to 44. 4 % for natural gas-only in the reference plant (full load and full substitution of supplementary firing corresponding to 39 % of natural gas). A HCC with higher biomass-firing capacity and an additional high-pressure condensing turbine can increase the substitution of natural gas to 59 % yielding ηe = 40. 8 % and total efficiency (electricity and heat) of 87. 1 %, i. e. a larger decrease in efficiency than for 39 % substitution. A HCC plant gives in all configurations higher electric efficiency than a corresponding combination of single-fuel stand-alone plants, CCGT for naturalgas and steam CHP plants for biomass, with the same share of biomass in thefuel mix.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{is to set up}} a method to {{estimate}} air emissions from energy consuming activities in an urban environment and to explore the effects of measures to minimize impact on air quality. 4 The main energetic activities that produce emissions in urban environments are transport, industrial processes and heating of buildings. The amount of a particular pollutant arising from a combustion process is estimated by the method of “emission factors”, that is, the emission is proportional to the “activity rate” of the process. The activity rate in transport is the number of kilometers covered by different kinds of motor vehicles and in the other combustion processes is the fuel (gas, gas oil, and oil) consumption. The emission factors used in this work are those of the EPA 1 and of CORINAIR 2 (transport). The input data needed for these evaluations are: fuel consumption and the number of kilometers covered by the vehicles in the area of interest. The method of “correlated variables” is used for spatial spreading of input data: it consists of attributing, to an aggregated value, the spatial distribution of the correlated variable. The distribution of occupied houses is used to spread fuel consumption for building heating in the household sector. All input data are distributed on a spatial grid to evaluate emissions for each pair of coordinates (i, j). Several measures can be hypothesized to reduce air pollution: substitution of energy sources; introduction of better technologies; and, in the case of transport, reduction of road traffic and an increase of public transport. These methods have been applied to the case of the city of Florence, Italy.

With a high ignition temperature and relatively low reactivity, natural gas can enable promising approaches to combustion engine design. In particular, the combination of low reactivity natural gas and high reactivity diesel may allow for optimal operation as a reactivity-controlled compression ignition (RCCI) engine, which has potential for high eciency and low emissions. In this computational study, a lean mixture of natural gas is ignited by direct injection of diesel fuel in {{a model of the}} heavy-duty CAT 3401 diesel engine. ^ Dual-fuel combustion of natural gas-diesel (NGD) may provide a wider range of reactivity control than other dual-fuel combustion strategies such as gasoline-diesel dual fuel. Accurate and ecient combustion modeling can aid NGD dual-fuel engine control and optimization. In this study, multi-dimensional simulation was performed using a nite-volume computational code for fuel spray, combustion and emission processes. Adaptive mesh renement (AMR) and multi-zone reaction modeling enables simulation in a reasonable time. The latter approach avoids expensive kinetic calculations in every computational cell, with considerable speedup. Two approaches to combustion modeling are used within the Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) framework. The rst approach uses direct integration of the detailed chemistry and no turbulence-chemistry interaction modeling. The model produces encouraging agreement between the simulation and experimental data. ^ For reasonable accuracy and computation cost, a minimum cell size of 0. 2 millimeters is suggested for NGD dual-fuel engine combustion. In addition, the role of dierent chemical reaction mechanism on the NGD dual-fuel combustion is considered with this model. ^ This work considers fundamental questions regarding combustion in NGD dualfuel combustion, particularly about how and where fuels react, and the dierence between combustion in the dual fuel mode and conventional diesel mode. ^ The results show that in part-load working condition main part of CH 4 cannot burn and it has significant effect in high level of HC emission in NGD dual-fuel engine. The CFD results revel that homogeneous mixture of CH 4 and air is too lean and it cannot ignite in regions that any species from C 7 H 16 chemical mechanism does not exist. ^ It is shown that multi-injection of diesel fuel with an early main injection can reduce HC emission significantly in the NGD dual-fuel engine. In addition, the results revel that increasing the air fuel ratio by decreasing the air amount could be a promising idea for HC emission reduction in NGD dual-fuel engine, too. ...|$|E
5|$|Reducing {{the partial}} {{pressure}} of the inert gas component of the breathing mixture will accelerate decompression as the concentration gradient will be greater for a given depth. This is achieved by increasing the fraction of oxygen in the breathing <b>gas</b> used, whereas <b>substitution</b> of a different inert gas will not produce the desired effect. Any substitution may introduce counter-diffusion complications, owing to differing rates of diffusion of the inert gases, {{which can lead to}} a net gain in total dissolved gas tension in a tissue. This can lead to bubble formation and growth, with decompression sickness as a consequence. Partial pressure of oxygen is usually limited to 1.6 bar during in water decompression for scuba divers, but can be up to 1.9 bar in-water and 2.2 bar in the chamber when using the US Navy tables for surface decompression, and up to 2.8 bar for therapeutic decompression.|$|R
40|$|A one {{dimensional}} {{model of the}} magnetic multipole volume plasma source has been developed for use in intense ion/neutral atom beam injectors. The model uses plasma transport coefficients for particle and energy flow to create {{a detailed description of}} the plasma parameters along an axis parallel to that of the extracted beam. Primarily constructed for applications to neutral beam injection systems on fusion devices, the model concentrates on the hydrogenic isotopes but can be extended to any <b>gas</b> by <b>substitution</b> of the relevant masses, cross sections and rate coefficients. The model considers the flow of fast ionizing electrons that create the ratios of the three hydrogenic isotope ion species, H+, H 2 +, H 3 + (and similarly for deuterium and tritium) as they flow towards the beam extraction electrode, together with the production of negative hydrogenic ions through volume processes. The use of detailed energy balance in the discharge allows the determination of the fraction of the gas density that is in an atomic state and also the gas temperature as well as the electron temperatures and plasma potential. Comparisons are made between the results of the model and experimental measurements in deuterium from a number of different filament driven sources used on beam heating facilities.

40|$|Le développement de la méthanisation dépend de {{plusieurs}} facteurs. Il s’agit, entre autres, des ressources disponibles, de leur proximité, des caractéristiques de l’économie locale et de leur impact sur le processus de décision. Ces éléments doivent nécessairement être pris en compte pour une mise en place pertinente de centres de production de biogaz. L’analyse menée en Pays de Fougères envisage tous ces points et {{permet de}} dégager différents scenarii. / Anaerobic digestion is a biological process offering many advantages: (i) energy production from local resources (ii) emission reduction of greenhouse <b>gases</b> (iii) <b>substitution</b> of fossil energy. In {{the context of}} potential development of collective biogas plants in France, the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in order to geolocate the bio-resources appears very interesting and useful tools. Such investigations {{have been carried out}} on both national and regional scales but need to be adapted for local diagnosis. For this purpose, a research project was devoted to the development of such methodologies, then applied in the “Pays de Fougères”, a 1000 km² wide rural area located in the north-eastern Brittany in France. Mapping the potential energy of the territory was established from the inventory of available resources (livestock manure, crop residues, sewage sludge from wastewater treatment plants, garden waste from drop-off centers, wastes from Agro-food industries and food wastes from school canteens and hospitals). For this purpose, GIS methods have been developed. This study initiates the construction of a GIS model to determine optimal sites for collective biogas plants...|$|R
40|$|With {{implementation}} of the Kyoto Protocol, the Former Soviet Union countries, and Russia in particular, {{will most likely be}} able to exert market power in the emission permit market. However, {{it can be argued that}} since these countries also are big exporters of fossil fuels, their incentives to boost the permit price in this way may be weak. This paper argues that the effect on the permit price of the Former Soviet Union being a fossil fuel exporter is more ambiguous than that. A significant share of Russia’s fossil fuel exports is in the form of natural gas. A high permit price may boost the demand for natural <b>gas</b> through <b>substitution</b> from more polluting fuels (coal and oil) and thus increase gas profits. Therefore, being a natural gas exporter may in fact increase the incentives to exert monopoly power in the permit market. Moreover, a large fossil fuel exporter may use its market position to influence the effective demand for permits and thereby their price. Hence, the relationship between permit income and fossil fuels exports runs in both directions. We explore the interdependence between the revenues of the Former Soviet Union from permit and fossil fuel exports both theoretically and empirically. A numerical general equilibrium model finds that the fact that the Former Soviet Union is a big gas exporter has a negligible effect on the incentives to exert monopoly power in the permit market. However, there are significant impacts on the optimal level of gas exports. JEL classification: Q 4, D 58, L 12, Q 28, Q 48.

40|$|Issues {{on energy}} have {{recently}} dominated the economic decisions of several states across the U. S. economy and {{states in the}} southeastern region of U. S. are no exception. Almost all {{the states in the}} southeast import virtually all of their fuel resources from the Gulf Coast representing an annual financial diversion of several billions of dollars some of which could be used to develop domestic, alternative energy resources. The focus {{of this study was to}} determine the potential substitution between renewable energy and conventional energy forms in the southeast of U. S. We developed a system of factor share equations using translog cost function. The system of equations was estimated using a pooled iterative Non-linear Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR) procedure with homogeneity and symmetry restrictions imposed. Findings indicate that factor demands in the southeast energy sector are price inelastic and there is limited substitution potential when energy prices rise in fuel production. The substitution potential of renewable energy for the conventional energy forms is found to be higher than that of other conventional energy forms for renewable except renewable energy for natural <b>gas.</b> The <b>substitution</b> of renewable energy for natural gas is technically infeasible since the elasticity is negative. Since renewable energy has the potential to substitute for other forms of energy besides natural gas, federal and state governments might want to reverse the $ 10 billion petroleum subsidy versus the current $ 5 billion for renewable if the target (36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022) set by 2007 Energy Independence Act is to be realized.
