500|$|The team {{felt that}} Sarah's {{physical}} appearance should feel authentic, displaying {{her relationship with}} Joel, while simultaneously establishing her as a distinct character. They aimed to establish the character as [...] "a down-to-earth girl who shares many qualities with Ellie". On the relationship between Joel and Sarah, Hayes felt that they are [...] "more like best friends than father and daughter", citing their playfulness and humor with each other. Hayes felt intimidated during her audition, due to her inexperience with video game performances. She {{found it difficult to}} perform lines in the recording studio, preferring to perform them with the body movements; she believed that the latter felt more natural. To perform Sarah's death, Hayes <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to remember and experience previous moments in her life, such as her grandfather's death.|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} the album Hu Hu Hu (2009) Lafourcade experienced writer's block, {{and felt that}} the songs she was writing were too {{similar to those in}} her previous albums. For her new work, she sought inspiration from Agustín Lara's repertoire and her native country, Mexico. [...] "One of the things I wanted to happen with this record was to find the connection with Mexico and its people again". She said she was a Mexican and proud of the [...] "very many" [...] positive parts it has. Musically, she wanted more simplicity in her songs. Lafourcade <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to write [...] "without judgement", recording voice memos on her phone as part of the writing process. She was inspired by the works of Latin American songwriters such as Simón Díaz, Violeta Parra, Mercedes Sosa, Chavela Vargas, and Caetano Veloso. While recording demos, Lafourcade realized that the songs were more direct and emotional than her previous work. The writing took three years, resulting in approximately 30songs. Since the album was about her personal life, she selected what she felt were [...] "the strongest ones", saying, [...] "more than making an album, I wanted to have songs... that could stand on their own".|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} {{directed}} by Charles McDougall, his first credit for the series. According to Kinsey, McDougal, in order to set the characters' moods, would start every scene by saying [...] "everyone happy, Angela pissed!" [...] McDougal sought to bring movement to the Secret Santa scene, due to it being a largely stationary sequence. The cold opening was shot four different times, and almost every time, the ceiling tile that Michael displaces with a tree [...] "crashed through the ceiling and almost killed Steve Carell". The scene wherein Angela starts crying when the Christmas party descends into chaos {{was based on a}} deleted scene from the earlier season two episode [...] "The Fire", where Angela starts crying during a talking head due to the stress of the situation. The scenes featuring snow were created by a company that specialized in producing fake snow. Daniels was initially worried that the shots would look fake, but he was pleased with the final results. According to Fischer, {{on the last day of}} shooting, the cast had a snowball fight—a scene that is included in the episode—which she called a [...] "magic moment". Fischer later recounted that the prop egg nog and pigs in a blanket were kept out for three straight days, an act that she felt was revolting. In order to make her scenes more real Phyllis Smith <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to cry for [...] "30 minutes" [...] between takes. Many of the cast members asked her what was wrong, but Smith refused to speak to them, in order to stay in character. The series' writers researched local Pennsylvania laws and discovered one that states a liquor salesman must wear a tie. Thus, the show features a liquor store worker wearing a tie. Several of the scenes were improvised on the spot. During the sequence where Angela angrily throws Christmas bulbs at a wall, Angela Kinsey was unable to get them to break, so she decided to stomp on them. Kate Flannery improvised her line about not drinking only during the week while she was filming her talking head.|$|E
2500|$|Despite being a shy woman, Sackville-West often <b>forced</b> <b>herself</b> to {{participate}} in literary readings before book clubs and on the BBC in order to {{feel a sense of}} belonging. Her love of the classical traditions in literature put her out of favor with modernist critics and by the 1940s, she was often dismissed as a dated writer, much to her chagrin. For an example, her epic poem [...] "Solitude", published by the Hogarth Press on 27 October 1938 contains references to the Bible, Saint Brenden, Paracelsus, Ixion, Catullus, Andromeda, the Iliad and a Sabine bride, all of which were quite acceptable in the early 20th century, but were seen as anachronistic by 1938. The narrator of Solitude has an ardent love of the English countryside and though the sex of the narrator is left ambiguous, implied at various points to be a man or a woman, it is made clear the narrator loved intensely a woman who is no longer around and who is deeply missed. At one point, it is suggested that the narrator's vividly expressed horror and disgust at Ixion, the brutal rapist whom the narrator feels was justly punished by Zeus, implies that she is a woman, and her desire at another point in the poem to free Andromeda from her chains to make love suggests that she is a lesbian. The narrator compares the love of nature to the love of books as both cultivate her mind, and thinks of herself as superior to the farmers who merely work the land without the time or the interest for poetry, all of which make it possible for her to have a deeper appreciation of nature. Sackville-West felt a deep sense of loss in signing documents in 1947 relinquishing any claim on Sissinghurst, as part of its transition to the National Trust. She wrote of the signing that it [...] "nearly broke my heart, putting my signature to what I regarded as a betrayal of all the tradition of my ancestors and the house I loved." ...|$|E
