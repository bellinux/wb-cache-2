2500|$|Lehrer's song [...] "The Old Dope Peddler" [...] is sampled in rapper 2 Chainz's song [...] "Dope Peddler", on his 2012 debut album, Based on a T.R.U. Story. [...] The {{following}} year, Lehrer {{said he was}} [...] "very proud" [...] to {{have his}} song sampled [...] "literally sixty years after I recorded it." [...] Lehrer went on to describe his official response to the request to use his song: [...] "As sole copyright owner of 'The Old Dope Peddler', I grant you motherfuckers permission to do this. [...] Please give my regards to Mr. Chainz, or may <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> 2?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Hilton {{expressed}} {{that his own}} son, Mario Armando Lavandeira III, will likely be bullied as well. Hilton said, [...] "He'll probably be bullied out and about because people might say things to {{me in front of}} him when we're in public... That's even one of the reasons why, even though his name is Mario, <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> Perez Jr. I want him to have an alter ego as well so when people do say things that are hurtful about his dad or hurtful about him hopefully it won't hurt as much because they don't really know him. Those people know you as Perez Jr. but you're not Perez Jr. so it doesn't matter what they say." ...|$|E
2500|$|Alec {{later became}} his father's {{business}} partner. In this capacity he {{assisted in the}} editing of his father's memoirs and took over {{the running of the}} family's agricultural interests including the estate at Shurugwi. In 1984 he wrote a semi-autobiographical account of the struggle for majority rule in Rhodesia titled Now <b>I</b> <b>Call</b> <b>Him</b> Brother. It was claimed that the book was ghost-written for Alec by the professional writer Rebecca de Saintonge. The book was not rated highly in literary terms and included the following comments on President Robert Mugabe (p124) : [...] "Mr Mugabe's Independence speech should have roused every Christian heart in the land. The whole tone of his talk was so Christian in content that every believer's heart should have been warmed by the thought that he was talking our language." ...|$|E

2500|$|Outside the {{critical}} reevaluation of local literature, Gârbea's work includes short humorous essays about various topics in post-1989 society and modern Romanian culture. One such chapter {{is built around}} the polemic between Gârbea and writer Gheorghe Grigurcu, {{over the issue of}} what it means for a working artist to be treated unjustly or be privileged. Another fragment documents and ridicules the impact of instant messaging on the Romanian lexis, with the rapid spread of abbreviations such as sal (for salut, [...] "hello"), vb (vorbim, [...] "we'll talk") and ms (mersi, [...] "thanks"). Gârbea also pokes fun at the babytalk-based jargon of parenting magazines, and contrasts its apparent artificiality with the awe he records having personally experienced after the birth of his son Tudor. It reads: [...] " [...] does not inspire in me the image of fragility and fondness, but the force of an entity which benefits from the advantage of The Unknown. When <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> using his human name, he smiles down on me, with devastating irony, so that I may grasp my complete lack of fantasizing ability. No matter what will happen in the future, these winter days [...] shall always remain for me under the sign of having met, {{for the first time in}} life, an inexplicable creature." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that year, {{there was}} an {{occasion}} when Emperor Taizong held a feast for the high-level officials at Danxiao Hall (丹霄殿), and at the feast, Zhangsun Wuji made the comment, [...] "Wang Gui and Wei Zheng were our enemies before. [...] I did not {{know at the time}} that we would get the chance to feast together." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "Wang and Wei served their master faithfully, and that was why I retained them. [...] I do have a question: Every time that Wei gave me adverse advice and I did not accept it, then he refused to discuss the matter any further. [...] Why?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "I give adverse advise only when I believe that something should not be done. [...] If Your Imperial Majesty did not follow my advice, then if I continued to speak about it, the matter would be settled and would be done. [...] That is why I spoke no further." [...] Emperor Taizong responded, [...] "You can first continue planning and then try to advise me again. [...] What harm is there?" [...] Wei responded, [...] "It was written that Emperor Shun warned his officials, 'Do not obey me in my presence and make secret speeches against what I do.' [...] If I know that something is wrong, but I continue to discuss it with Your Imperial Majesty, then I would be obeying you in your presence. [...] That is not how Houji [...] and Ziqi [...] served Emperor Shun." [...] Emperor Taizong laughed and stated, [...] "Everyone says that Wei is arrogant and careless, but <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> 'delicate'; this shows it." ...|$|E
60|$|PATRICIA. Oh, {{you need}} not trouble. He will come if <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
60|$|There was a porter there whom I {{had spoken}} to once or twice. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> on one side.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not know}} we were {{approaching}} till <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him,</b> then he started slightly as he saw the tall, proud girl.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then he said I was mean, {{and then}} he said I was base, and then <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a beggar. If I had been cool, perhaps <b>I</b> shouldn't have <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a beggar. But I did, and I am ready to take the {{consequences}} of it.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> my Richard! But he {{says that}} he has two mamas, and I am one.|$|E
6000|$|... --A wolf in sheep's clothing, {{says the}} citizen. That's what he is. Virag from Hungary! Ahasuerus <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him.</b> Cursed by God.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, my stepfather. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> father, {{though it}} sounds funny, too, {{for he is}} only five years and two months older than myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|There {{was a place}} {{left for}} the date, which I suppose he had forgotten. I made no remark about this inscription, for I did not know exactly what remark was needed; but the next morning <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> [...] "Rectus," [...] {{just the same as}} ever, for I knew he had printed our names on the box to show me that he wanted to let me off my promise. I guess the one time <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Colbert was enough for him.|$|R
60|$|Mask. Madam, 'tis {{certainly}} my master; {{and he is}} so zealous to {{make his}} peace, {{that he could not}} stay till <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> to you.----Sir.|$|R

60|$|A confidant had BAILEY B., A gay Mongolian dog was he; I am {{not good}} at Turkish names, And so <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> SIMPLE JAMES.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh no, he's not clumsy--considering that he's {{an invalid}} himself. He's {{a very good}} nurse--for a sick-nurse. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> my sick-nurse because he's sick himself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's what I seldom do myself," [...] says Mr. Krook with a grin. [...] "Shall <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> down? But it's a weak chance if he'd come, sir!" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} my own waggons came up. Indaba-zimbi {{was sitting on}} the box of the first, wrapped in a blanket. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> and told him the news.|$|R
6000|$|Then it {{was that}} I let out a few links. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> {{a son of a}} toad. <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> all the other things he had called me. And then <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a few {{additional}} things. I came from the West, where men knew how to swear, and I wasn't going to let any mangy shack on a measly New England [...] "jerk" [...] put it over me in vividness and vigor of language. At first the shack tried to laugh it down. Then he made the mistake of attempting to reply. I let out a few more links, and I cut him to the raw and therein rubbed winged and flaming epithets. Nor was my fine frenzy all whim and literary; I was indignant at this vile creature, who, in default of a dollar, would consign me to three months of slavery. Furthermore, I had a sneaking idea that he got a [...] "drag" [...] out of the constable fees.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't trouble. The poor devil's half dead with exhaustion. I {{told him}} he might sleep till <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> don't want much, and I can easily get it myself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'That was our light porter at the Bank,' said Tom, 'who {{brought you}} the message to-night. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> our light porter, because I {{belong to the}} Bank too.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "This is my charger. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> Rollo. He was bred on {{the estate}} and, when I am upon him, I feel that the king is not better mounted." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mutual Friend, Vaughan's and mine. Shares {{this study}} with us. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> dear partly because he's {{head of the}} House, and therefore, of course, we respect and admire him.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you remember, when <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> a swell? Ah, dear! so he was. That was the mistake, {{and it was}} all my own fault, as I {{had seen}} it from the first." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> [...] "Fritz." [...] He {{drew his}} chair close to mine, and laid his hand affectionately on my shoulder. I {{began to think}} I had perhaps {{encouraged}} him a little too readily.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> in. The {{appearance}} of the low-minded cove was hailed with disapprobation from all sides, {{on account of his}} having brought his corkscrew with him. He pleaded [...] "the force of habit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Susanna, not in {{the least}} impressed, [...] "he always is blameless. How is Bob? I mean Marmaduke, your cousin. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> Bob, short for Cherry Bob." ...|$|E
60|$|And then old Pettit smiled slowly. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> Gentleman Pettit now to myself. It's {{a miserable}} name {{to give a}} man, but it sounds better than it looks in print.|$|E
60|$|After all, should <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>him</b> unlucky? He {{had escaped}} the snare I had laid for him, and perhaps (such things have been) even a Newnham jury might find him not guilty.|$|E
6000|$|THE FLOWER GIRL [much distressed] It's because <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> Captain. <b>I</b> {{meant no}} harm. [To the gentleman] Oh, sir, don't let him lay a charge agen {{me for a}} word like that. You-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Vell, you are green. Wouldn't any cove {{with half}} an eye {{see that the}} dog knows me, an' so, in course, I must know <b>him?</b> An' ven <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>'im</b> Punch didn't he answer?--hey?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! as for me, my {{judgment}} is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when <b>I</b> <b>called</b> <b>him</b> plain." ...|$|R
