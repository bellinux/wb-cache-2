50|$|It is not {{necessary}} to use filter in an air mover in a relatively clean environment. Generally, a <b>gauze</b> <b>filter</b> is attached to the inlet to collect larger particles. However, filters are always a beneficial precaution.In environments with high ambient dust levels, it is beneficial to utilize a filter system that has double filtration. First, air passes through a pre-filter that collects larger dust particles. Second, the air travels through a screen filter where smaller particles are captured.|$|E

50|$|Oiled {{cotton gauze}} is {{employed}} {{in a growing}} number of aftermarket automotive air filters marketed as high-performance items. In the past, cotton gauze saw limited use in original-equipment automotive air filters. However, since the introduction of the Abarth SS versions, the Fiat subsidiary supplies cotton <b>gauze</b> air <b>filters</b> as OE filters.|$|R
30|$|For {{analysis}} of Monascus content, 5  ml liquid fermentation medium {{was placed on}} four layers of <b>gauze</b> for <b>filtering,</b> and the <b>gauze</b> was then washed with sterile water until the liquid was colorless. The gauze was dried in an oven at 60  °C overnight and then weighed. The pH value was determined in different media using a pH meter. The experiment was performed in triplicate, and values are presented as average values of three independent measurements.|$|R
50|$|Throughout {{the first}} two parts, almost {{everything}} is seen through {{the eye of the}} camera (designated in the script as E), although there are occasional moments when O's perception is seen. In the third part, much more of O’s perception of the room and its contents is given. In order to distinguish between the two perceptions, objects seen by O were shot through a lens-gauze, blurring his perception while E's perception was shot without <b>gauze</b> or <b>filters,</b> keeping the images sharp.|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} was {{performed}} in order to investigate {{the relationships between the}} salt use, the mechanisms affecting the salt emission, dispersion and the salt exposure in a modeling approach. The salt was collected on <b>gauze</b> <b>filter</b> salt vanes at distances of 2. 5 m to 100 m from the road, allowing a time resolution of 30 minutes to 24 hour exposure time. The results will be implemented in a winter maintenance management model under development by the Swedish National Road and Transport Research Institute (VTI). The results showed that the roadside exposure to airborne salt is strongly related to the wind direction. The road conditions of packed snow and thin ice seemed to temporarily abate the roadside exposure by capturing the salt on the road surface. Even at a distance of 100 m from the road a positive relation of the wind sum and chloride deposition showed on days with strong winds. The modeling approach indicate the importance of residual salt, traffic, road surface characteristics, and wind for roadside exposure but also that there are several aspects of these variables that need further investigations...|$|E

H. Anderson, Samuel MacNeil, C. H. Beale, R. A. Ashworth, Holmes Whitmore, William F. Hovis, and Bertram Jackson, clerical members of the executive committee of the Milwaukee Federation of Churches (100 members), request, in a postscript to a circular, that individual members ask the Health Commissioner why saloons are permitted to stay open, while churches are not, and why the church constituency has not been consulted; ‘Mr. Anderson told a Journal reporter: “…We think that there is more danger in allowing the saloons to remain open during the epidemic of Spanish influenza than to allow the churches to remain open. Our observation has been that when people are ill, even slightly, they do not go to church and presumably this would hold good during the epidemic. There is less chance of this being the situation in the case of saloons. ”’• Milwaukee teachers, under Dr. Brumbaugh, have reported 2, 124 cases of influenza, colds, and pneumonia {{as a result of their}} home visits• The health commissioner has issued a warning against large gatherings in private homes• Adjacent to article is an advertisement for Nasal Filter Co., St. Paul, Minn. : “Influenza Epidemic vs. Tiny Nasal Filters: Moist <b>gauze</b> <b>filter</b> prevents breathing dust, germs, etc. Aids breathing and hardly noticeably.

40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of Campylobacter jejuni {{indicates that}} waterborne transmission is important; the organism has been isolated from seawater, fresh water, and estuarine sites. Membrane filtration, {{with and without}} use of an enrichment broth, {{has been the most}} common method for isolating C. jejuni from water. We evaluated two methods for isolating C. jejuni from water: membrane filtration and gauze filtration. The membrane filters evaluated included 0. 22 - and 0. 45 -micron-pore Millipore filters (Millipore Corp., Bedford, Mass.), 0. 2 - and 0. 4 -micron-pore Nuclepore filters (Nucleopore Corp., Pleasanton, Calif.), and a 0. 45 -micron-pore Zetapor filters (AMF Cuno, Meridian, Conn.). The <b>gauze</b> <b>filters</b> included both Moore and Spira swabs. Of the membrane filters evaluated, the 0. 45 -micron-pore Millipore and Zetapor filters were the most sensitive for recovery of C. jejuni from seeded waters. The 0. 45 -micron-pore Millipore filter placed in Oosterom broth was better for recovery of C. jejuni from seeded stationary surface waters than either the Spira or Moore swab. However, the 0. 45 -micron-pore Millipore filter placed on a plate or in enrichment broth was equivalent to the Spira gauze swab when used to examine water from Atlanta area streams. C. jejuni organisms were isolated from 9 of 24 surface water samples representing 5 of 12 streams...|$|R
3000|$|The {{preparation}} of cochineal takes about 3 hours. 10 g of cochineal was crushed in an agate mortar and soaked in 1 / 8 liter of sodium ash wood for 2 hours. The solution was filtered and boiled. 1 / 8 liter of a saturated solution of alum in demineralized water was then {{added to the}} mixture off the heat. The mixture was passed through a <b>filter</b> (<b>gauze</b> pad) and then left to dry in the shade (recipe taken from [...] "the manuscript of Padua" [...] (XVII century) [19]).|$|R
5000|$|The {{other common}} design (the more {{traditional}} [...] "pooter") {{consists of a}} length of flexible tubing, of which one end is held in the mouth, and the other end which holds the tip. The tip is usually a glass or plastic pipette inserted into the plastic tubing, {{with a piece of}} <b>gauze</b> as a <b>filter</b> at the inner end to prevent accidental ingestion. Small insects (e.g., Drosophila) may be gently collected and held against the filter by steady inhalation, and transferred into a container by then blowing the insect(s) out. A skilled lab worker, for instance, may be able to sequentially inhale and then transfer a pooter-full of Drosophila flies singly into vials, thus facilitating rapid setup of fly experiments with a minimum of pain caused to the researcher, or the researched. Larger, motor-powered variants of this design exist (typically, a leaf blower working in reverse), where the insects are sucked into a mesh collecting bag in a long plastic tube, and held there by the powerful suction.|$|R
