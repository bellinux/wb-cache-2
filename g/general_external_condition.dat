Challenge for the company which marketed the product is the difficulty to make consumer’s sure that the product gave benefit for them. So there needed an effective marketing strategy to sell the chicken egg with two yolks latest innovation product. The most effective strategy shall be formulated according to systematic analysis steps to internal and external conditions of the company. Internal environment analysis consisted of product strengths and weakness sourced from company’s internal determination and to be more valid, there should be determination by consumer’s product. Consumer could assess the strengths and weakness of 4 P (product, promotion, place, price) in neutral. External environment analysis sourced from management determination to the <b>general</b> <b>external</b> <b>condition</b> about opportunity and threats to the chicken egg with two yolks marketing development. External and internal analysis consisted of SWOT frame analysis. SWOT frame analysis sharpen the marketing strategy formulation. Because {{of the importance of}} management and marketing strategy for chicken egg with two yolks which was latest innovation product, there needed research titled: “Marketing Strategy of Chicken’s Egg with Two yolks in PT Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk”. The research purpose were: (1) finding out people respond to chicken egg with two yolks; (2) finding out strength, weakness, threat, and opportunity in chicken egg with two yolks marketing; (3) formulating marketing strategy which applied by company to sell chicken egg with two yolks as latest innovation product. Location stated was done by purposive, PT. Multi Breeder Indonesia Tbk in Sidoarjo. In this research, which became respondents was PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk and people who consume the chicken egg with two yolks also people who lived in PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Tbk. Respondents from PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia was taken by purposive, that was the main owner or vice director who represent the owner. From the consumer, there were 30 people taken by accidental sampling method. Data collection method was done by interview, observation, and library study. Analysis method used was descriptive analysis, quantitative consisted of: (1) external strategy factor matrix; (2) Internal strategy factor matrix, SWOT (strengths, weakness, opportunity, treaths). Chicken egg with two yolks consumer in PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk in average were male, 30 - 39 year old, located in Malang, working in private institution, and had income between Rp 1. 500. 001 -Rp 2. 500. 000. Strength owed by chicken egg with two yolks marketing in PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk was delicious, cheap price, good service, strategic location. The weakness owed by PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk was big egg size, white colored shell, thin shell. Opportunity owed by chicken egg with two yolks in PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk were lack of market demand, people nutrition, minimization of household fund. Threat owed in chicken egg with two yolks marketing PT. Multi Breeder Adirama Indonesia Tbk was people respond to the chicken egg with two yolks and lack of stock. Ideal marketing strategy after SWOT analysis fit with internal external strategy factor matrix analysis was S-O (strength-opportunities) by defending and increasing service in central depo, increasing quality product. By the strategy, there hoped that consumer would defend and pull new consumer...|$|E

The long run cost curves reflect the production technology and the organizational structure of a company. These elements are the result of choices made by the entrepreneur and they are certainly influenced by the economic environment where the company is working. This study analyses the discount of the winning bids in the contracts for public works in the construction industry recorded over a sufficiently large and homogeneous period with respect to <b>general</b> <b>external</b> <b>conditions.</b> Based on known microeconomic models and on some specific assumptions, the winning discounts have been used to draw the long run cost curves. In turn, these cost curves have allowed to detect and classify different business strategies in the organization of companies operating in different Italian regions.

Changes in norms are typically caused by one of three mechanisms: they can be triggered by idiosyncratic changes in individual perceptions and expectations, by changes in <b>general</b> <b>external</b> <b>conditions</b> (such as prices or technology), and by deliberate experimentation with novel ideas. While these mechanisms differ in some respects, they have similar dynamic effects: change tends to be slow and fitful at first, then accelerates rapidly once a critical threshold is crossed. Of particular importance to norm diffusion is the structure of the social network through which agents obtain information. This paper characterizes the rate at which a social innovation spreads based on three factors: the extent to which agents interact in small clusters, the payoff gain of the innovation relative to the status quo, and the amount of noise in the best response process. The analysis shows why social innovations tend to occur in large jumps rather than through small incremental improvements...|$|R
40|$|A {{promising}} {{approach to}} overcome decoherence in quantum computing schemes is to perform active quantum error correction using topology. Topological subsystem codes incorporate both {{the benefits of}} topological and subsystem codes, allowing for error syndrome recovery with only 2 -local measurements in a two-dimensional array of qubits. We study the error threshold for topological subsystem color codes under very <b>general</b> <b>external</b> noise <b>conditions.</b> By transforming the problem into a classical disordered spin model, we estimate using Monte Carlo simulations that topological subsystem codes have an optimal error tolerance of 5. 5 (2) %. This means there is ample space for improvement in existing error-correcting algorithms that typically find a threshold of approximately 2 %. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figures, 4 author...|$|R
40|$|Can global {{internal}} and spacetime symmetries be connected without supersymmetry? To answer this question, we investigate Minkowski spacetimes with d space-like extra dimensions {{and point out}} under which <b>general</b> <b>conditions</b> <b>external</b> symmetries induce internal symmetries in the effective 4 -dimensional theories. We further discuss in this context how internal degrees of freedom and spacetime symmetries can mix without supersymmetry {{in agreement with the}} Coleman-Mandula theorem. We present some specific examples which rely on a direct product structure of spacetime such that orthogonal extra dimensions can have symmetries which mix with global internal symmetries. This mechanism opens up new opportunities to understand global symmetries in particle physics. Comment: 6 pages, discussion extended, version published in Phys. Lett. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} {{is to provide a}} clear and {{thorough}} conceptual analysis of the main candidates for a definition of climate and climate change. Five desiderata on a definition of climate are presented: it should be empirically applicable, it should correctly classify different climates, it should not depend on our knowledge, is should be applicable to the past, present and future and it should be mathematically well-defined. Then five definitions are discussed: climate as distribution over time for constant <b>external</b> <b>conditions,</b> climate as distribution over time when the <b>external</b> <b>conditions</b> vary as in reality, climate as distribution over time relative to regimes of varying <b>external</b> <b>conditions,</b> climate as the ensemble distribution for constant <b>external</b> <b>conditions,</b> and climate as the ensemble distribution when the <b>external</b> <b>conditions</b> vary as in reality.
