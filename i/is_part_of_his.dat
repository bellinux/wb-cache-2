25|$|Irenaeus' {{emphasis}} on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding {{emphasis on}} the unity of salvation history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> plan for humanity. The essence of this plan {{is a process of}} maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures {{to take a long time}} to grow into or assume the divine likeness.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{scholarship}} {{states that}} Shankara's arguments on revelation are about apta vacana (Sanskrit: आप्तवचन, sayings of the wise, relying on word, testimony of {{past or present}} reliable experts). It <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> and Advaita Vedanta's epistemological foundation. Advaita Vedanta school considers such testimony epistemically valid asserting that a human being needs to know numerous facts, and with the limited time and energy available, he can learn {{only a fraction of}} those facts and truths directly. Shankara considered the teachings in the Vedas and Upanishads as apta vacana and a valid source of knowledge. He suggests the importance of teacher-disciple relationship on combining logic and revelation to attain moksha in his text Upadeshasahasri. Rambachan and others state Shankara methodology did not rely exclusively on Vedic statements, but included a range of logical methods, reasoning methodology and pramanas.|$|E

500|$|Kapoor {{said that}} of the three {{characters}} he plays—Javed the poet, Govind the struggling musician and Krish the college student—Krish is the closest to himself, but Javed was the most interesting, a type of character he had never played before. Javed uses shayari, a type of poetry, to flirt. [...] "Shayaris are his pickup lines and very often he does succeed to getting the girls," [...] said Kapoor. [...] "He is not a sophisticated shayar and that <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> charm." [...] He also called Javed [...] "the funniest and naughtiest character of 1910 I have ever seen." [...] Despite the role being his favourite, Kapoor faced problems with the era-appropriate costume, which required him to wear traditional mojari shoes and clip-on stud earrings; he suffered from both shoe bites and red ears during filming.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{decided that}} Dredd should appear lean and fast like a boxer rather than bulky like [...] "someone who spends hours sort of steroiding himself up." [...] His Judge uniform was altered from the comic version; an {{extruded}} eagle statuette {{was removed from}} his shoulder pad to emphasise the outfit's functionality {{and give it a}} sense of realism. Garland said: [...] "If you did a very faithful adaptation of the uniform you'd have someone who if he got stabbed in the stomach he’d be in big trouble. Dredd is out there on the frontline so he needed protection." [...] Remaining faithful to the comic, Dredd's face, except for his mouth, is never shown and his helmet is not removed throughout the film. Urban said: [...] "He {{is supposed to be the}} faceless representative of the law and I think that <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> enigma...You wouldn't get to the end of a Sergio Leone Western and go, 'God, I didn't even know the character's name!' It's irrelevant." ...|$|E

He adopted a son, Massimo Luca Monty when he was 7 days old from the children's home. In 2011, he ran the half-marathon race at the Standard Chartered Marathon alongside radio deejay Rod Monteiro and kinesiologist Dr Tan Swee Kheng to help raise S$12,000 for Sanctuary House, which provides foster care for children. In 2012, Đurić drove a taxi for 12 days to raise $2,657 for The Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund. He and his three kids also painted plastic doves that were sold in aid of the Dover Park Hospice in September 2013.

500|$|Drawn by a {{distress}} signal, the Doctor and Rose arrive via TARDIS in {{a massive}} underground bunker near Salt Lake City, Utah in 2012, filled with alien artifacts. They are discovered by soldiers and taken to the bunker's owner, Henry van Statten, who cordially welcomes them. Rose is offered {{a tour of the}} facility by a technician Adam Mitchell, while the Doctor stays behind to talk to van Statten. Van Statten takes the Doctor to show him the pride of his collection, which he calls the [...] "Metaltron", and directs the Doctor into a room that <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> secure Vault. Inside, the Doctor is shocked to discover the Metaltron is a Dalek, which he thought were all wiped out from the Time War. The Dalek is weak and unable to break its bonds, but when the Doctor attempts to destroy it, van Statten orders his guards to restrain the Doctor and return him to his offices. There, van Statten has the Doctor secured, noting that not only does he collect aliens, but also tortures them to gain information, and proceeds to invasively and violently study the Doctor's body to learn more about his psychology.|$|E
500|$|Mary Shelley {{expanded}} and revised the Roman poet Ovid's story of Proserpine, which <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> larger Metamorphoses. The tale {{is based on}} the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone, which explains the change of the seasons through Persephone's visits to the Underworld: when she is confined to Hades's realm, autumn and winter cover the earth, and when she returns to live with her mother, spring and summer bloom. The myth depicts the victory of male violence over female procreation. Like Percy Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron, Mary Shelley was interested in rewriting the classical myths; however, like other Romantic women writers, she was particularly interested in challenging their patriarchal themes. In revising the Proserpine myth, she placed women and their power at the centre of the narrative. For example, Ovid represents Proserpine as [...] "an unreflective child, willfully straying after flowers in infantile abandon" [...] while [...] "Shelley portrays Proserpine as a thoughtful, empathetic adolescent" [...] who wants to find flowers for her mother. Ovid's version of the myth focuses on violence, particularly the abduction and rape of Proserpine, while Shelley's play focuses on the suspenseful search for Proserpine. Her version highlights Ceres and the nymphs’ grief and Proserpine's own desire to escape from the Underworld instead of the rape (the rape happens offstage). In contrast, other nineteenth-century adaptations often expanded the rape scene, romanticising it and turning it into a scene of courtship.|$|E
500|$|Supernova {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} critics. Bret Love of Allmusic gave the album 4.5 stars out of five, calling it [...] "a wonderful album of varying moods and textures." [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard magazine named the album an [...] "accomplished work that highlights a more introspective and versatile Rubalcaba." [...] On the album review, Cobo also commented that [...] "this [...] is a refreshing outing." [...] All About Jazz' Mark Corroto {{stated that the}} album proves that the performer [...] "has plenty of heart rooted in a traditional Cuban music past and a head pointed into a diverse North American future." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters stated that Supernova is a [...] "wonderful record, that proves that Rubalcaba {{is one of the}} greatest composers and pianist in the world," [...] but was critical about the lack of emotional commitment to his music, concluding that the album would work better on an audience that never heard the performer before. Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+ grade, arguing that it [...] "neatly showcases Rubalcaba's strengths: unerring yet playful rhythm, technical ferocity when required, burnished balladry, and Cuban swagger blended with jazz suavity." [...] George Tysh of Metro Times stated that Supernova [...] "incorporates both Rubalcaba personalities, being more percussively rhythmic (definitely more Latin) than Inner Voyage, but still as sensitive." [...] Jazz Review granted the album a perfect score of five stars, with Don Williamson stating that the album [...] "continues to prove that Rubalcaba is dedicated to the authenticity, the tradition and the spirit of the Cuban music he studied and which <b>is</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> being." [...] The Rubalcaba's biography included on the book Jazz for Dummies (2006) by Dick Sutro, emphasizes that the album founds the performer on his peak form.|$|E
