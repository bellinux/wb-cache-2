Smooth muscle surrounds the body's blood vessels and when relaxed causes these vessels to dilate resulting in an immediate increase in heart rate and blood flow {{throughout the}} body, producing a sensation of heat and excitement that usually lasts <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes.</b> When these vessels dilate, a further result is an immediate decrease in blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|The first {{match of}} the first Survivor Series was the first Survivor Series {{elimination}} match. Randy Savage, Jake Roberts, Ricky Steamboat, Brutus Beefcake, and Jim Duggan faced WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion The Honky Tonk Man, Hercules, Danny Davis, Ron Bass, and Harley Race. Savage's team was seconded by his wife Miss Elizabeth while Honky's team was seconded by Bobby Heenan and Jimmy Hart. Beefcake and Hercules started off before Duggan and Race were tagged in. Duggan knocked Race {{out of the ring}} and followed him out where they brawled and both men were counted out and eliminated, leaving four men on each team. Beefcake hit a high knee on Bass, and went on to eliminate him. Team captain Honky himself joined the match and hit his Shake, Rattle and Roll on Beefcake and eliminated him, evening the match at three all. Roberts hit a DDT on Davis and only two men remained in Honky's team, Honky and Hercules. Savage hit the Savage Elbow on Hercules and pinned him, leaving Honky the only member in his team. After being dominated by Savage, Roberts and Steamboat <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes,</b> Honky was atomic dropped over the top rope by Savage and ran from the ring with Jimmy Hart and his IC Belt and was counted out. Honky's self-elimination made Savage, Roberts and Steamboat the survivors of the match.|$|E

2500|$|Caster (or castor) (0.35mm), a {{very fine}} sugar in Britain and other Commonwealth countries, so-named because the grains are {{small enough to fit}} through a castor which is small vessel with a {{perforated}} top, from which to sprinkle sugar at table. Commonly used in baking and mixed drinks, it is sold as [...] "superfine" [...] sugar in the United States. Because of its fineness, it dissolves more quickly than regular white sugar and is thus especially useful in meringues and cold liquids. Castor sugar can be prepared at home by grinding granulated sugar <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> in a mortar or food processor.|$|E
2500|$|In 1970, Hayes {{released}} two albums, The Isaac Hayes Movement and To Be Continued. The former {{stuck to}} the four-song template of his previous album. Jerry Butler's [...] "I Stand Accused" [...] begins with a trademark spoken word monologue, and Bacharach's [...] "I Just Don't Know What to Do with Myself" [...] is re-worked. The latter spawned the classic [...] "The Look of Love", another Bacharach song transformed into an 11-minute epic of lush orchestral rhythm (mid-way it breaks into a rhythm guitar jam <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> <b>minutes</b> before suddenly resuming the slow love song). An edited three-minute version was issued as a single. The album also featured the instrumental [...] "Ike's Mood," [...] which segued into {{his own version of}} [...] "You've Lost That Loving Feeling". Hayes released a Christmas single, [...] "The Mistletoe and Me" [...] (with [...] "Winter Snow" [...] as a B-side).|$|E
