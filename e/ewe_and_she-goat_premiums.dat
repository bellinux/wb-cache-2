40|$|Four {{groups of}} eight {{primiparous}} <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> their single lambs were grazed for 2 weeks on pasture containing {{one of four}} novel grass species - perennial ryegrass, timothy, cocksfoot and red fescue. When subsequently grazed in a field with randomized plots of the four species, both <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> lambs spent longer grazing the species to {{which they had been}} accustomed than was spent by <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> lambs accustomed to other species. This effect was proportionately greater for the lambs than the <b>ewes,</b> <b>and</b> the lambs responded most to experience of cocksfoot and red fescue. Both <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> lambs spent most time grazing perennial ryegrass and timothy, and least time grazing red fescue, with cocksfoot intermediate. It is concluded that perennial ryegrass and timothy are grazed by <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> lambs in preference to cocksfoot and red fescue, but that a two week period of experience will increase the attractiveness of the less-preferred species, particularly to lambs...|$|R
40|$|This {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to estimate variation of phenotypic values and genetic distance of Garut sheep and crossbreed of Garut. A total of 725 Garut sheep (357 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 368 rams) were used in this study sheep were consisted of 74 Margawai crossbred sheep (40 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 34 rams), 81 fighting type sheep from Wanaraja (B) (37 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 44 rams), 74 meat type sheep from Wanaraja (W) (50 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 24 rams), 110 fighting type from Sukawening (A) (50 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 60 rams), 63 meat type from Sukawening (S) (40 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 23 rams), 63 fighting type from Ciomas (C) (20 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 43 rams), 189 crossbreed type from Jonggol (J) (68 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 121 rams) and 71 meat type from TDS or Cinagara (T) (52 <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 19 rams). Body dimension studied were body weight, body length, wither height, chest width, chest depth, chest circumference, tail length, tail width. Data obtained were analyzed by simple discriminant and canonical analysis with SAS package program version 7. 0 and MEGA 2 to get the construction of phenogram tree. The result showed that Margawati sheep had given more variation phenotype value in Garut sheep in district and out district of Garut. The lenght of genetics distance between fighting Wanaraja and Jonggol sheep was 14, 46 while the closed genetics distance between fighting Wanaraja and fighting Sukawening was 1, 53 and same as the genetic distance between fighting Wanaraja and Margawati sheep. The tail width, wither height, body length and chest circumferene were variables to determine the different groups of Garut sheep and crossbreed.

40|$|This {{epidemiological}} study monitored {{the occurrence of}} the coccidia genus Eimeria and their species composition over a oneyear period at an organic sheep farm in the Czech Republic. Individual faecal samples were collected from thirty lambs <b>and</b> thirty <b>ewes</b> once a month throughout the whole survey. As a result, 348 and 333 samples from <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> lambs respectively were evaluated using the faecal flotation technique. The overall prevalence of eimeriosis was 75. 7 % and 54. 0 % for lambs <b>and</b> <b>ewes</b> respectively. Four Eimeria species (E. ovinoidalis, E. crandallis/weybridgensis, E. parva, and E. intricata) were identified in both, lambs <b>and</b> <b>ewes,</b> during this survey. The most prevalent species was E. ovinoidalis, with an overall prevalence of 84 % in <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> 85 % in lambs, followed by E. parva and E. crandallis/weybridgensis. The oocysts faecal output was seasonal. The highest oocysts per gram levels were detected in February (139 000) and May (250 000) in <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> in February (1 949 900), March (326 000), and May (187 700) in lambs.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate the influence of high iodine intake in <b>ewes</b> on haematological <b>and</b> biochemical parameters of the blood of <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> their lambs. Twelve pregnant ewes of the Sumava sheep breed and their newborn lambs were included in the experiment. Control group (A) consisted of 6 ewes with 7 lambs and experimental group (B) comprised 6 ewes with 6 lambs. The feed ration was enriched with calcium iodate by addition of 3 and 5 mg/kg in group A and group B, respectively. The studied parameters in <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> lambs were haematocrit value, red blood cell count and haemoglobin concentration in blood, concentration of urea and total proteins, and alkaline phosphatase activity in blood plasma. No differences were found out in haematocrit value, red blood cell count, concentration of haemoglobin and total proteins between groups of <b>ewes</b> A <b>and</b> B with their lambs. Urea concentration and alkaline phosphatase activity were higher in ewes of group B and their lambs during the entire experimental period. An increase in the values of urea and alkaline phosphatase in the group of <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> lambs with higher iodine intake indicates a potential risk of high iodine intake associated with changes in the thyroid activity in <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> their lambs...|$|R

40|$|Although {{a number}} of common {{reproductive}} disorders in livestock involve bacterial infection, very {{little is known about}} their normal vaginal microbiota. Therefore, we sought to determine the species composition of sheep and cattle vaginal microbiota. Twenty Rambouillet <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> twenty crossbred cows varying in age and reproductive status were sampled by ectocervicovaginal lavage. We amplified and sequenced the V 3 -V 4 region of the 16 S ribosomal RNA contents yielding a total of 907, 667 high-quality reads. Good's Coverage estimates indicated that we obtained data on 98 +/- 0. 01 % of the total microbial genera present in each sample. Cow <b>and</b> <b>ewe</b> vaginal microbiota displayed few differences. Cow microbiota exhibited greater (P ≤ 0. 05) α-diversity compared to the ewe microbiota. Both livestock species differed (P ≤ 0. 05) from all previously reported vaginal communities. While bacteria were numerically dominant, Archaea were detected in 95 % of cow <b>and</b> <b>ewe</b> samples, mainly of the order Desulfurococcales. Both <b>ewes</b> <b>and</b> cows were predominately colonized by the bacterial phyla Bacteroidetes, Fusobacteria, and Proteobacteria. The most abundant genera were Aggregatibacter spp., and Streptobacillus spp. Lactobacillus ssp. were detected in 80 % of <b>ewe</b> <b>and</b> 90 % of cow samples, but only at very low abundances. Bacteria previously described from culture-based studies as common to the cow <b>and</b> <b>ewe</b> vaginal tract, except for Escherichia, were variably present, and only in low abundance. <b>Ewe</b> <b>and</b> cow pH differed (P ≤ 0. 05), with means (+/- standard deviation) of 6. 7 +/- 0. 38 and 7. 3 +/- 0. 63, respectively. In conclusion, 16 S rRNA sequencing of cow <b>and</b> <b>ewe</b> vaginal ectocervicovaginal lavages showed that cow <b>and</b> <b>ewe</b> vaginal microbiota differ from culture-led results, revealing a microbiota distinct from previously described vaginal ecosystems...|$|R
