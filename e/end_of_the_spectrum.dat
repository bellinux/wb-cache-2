5|$|The {{flowers of}} Schlumbergera have adaptations for {{pollination}} by hummingbirds: tubular flowers with abundant nectar, and colours towards the red <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum.</b> Most species require cross-pollination to set seed. The exceptions are S. kautskyi and S. microsphaerica; as noted above, {{the latter is}} found at higher altitudes where humming birds may be absent or less common.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape {{that is not}} radially symmetrical, with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, its economy is {{dominated}} by the economies of Newcastle–upon–Tyne and Gateshead town centre. This is reflected in terms of independent commercial space; retail floor space in the suburb totals 1% of that available in the whole metropolitan borough. There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road, which provide some employment, though these are at the lower <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> and provide little choice. There is a good provision of hardware stores, fast–food outlets and hairdressers, a butcher's shop, a greengrocer and a supermarket, but there is no bakery, bank nor building society and the Post Office has closed. The retail units were domestic properties, so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20% are vacant.|$|E

The record for most penalty minutes is held by Mick Vukota with 1,879 minutes while the record for most goals is held by Mike Bossy, who scored 573 goals over a ten-year time period. Bossy is one of 31 players who have been with the team during {{at least one of}} their four Stanley Cup victories.|$|E
5|$|Many {{tropical}} cyclones develop {{when the}} atmospheric conditions around a weak disturbance {{in the atmosphere}} are favorable. Others form when other types of cyclones acquire tropical characteristics. Tropical systems are then moved by steering winds in the troposphere; if the conditions remain favorable, the tropical disturbance intensifies, and can even develop an eye. On the other <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> if the conditions around the system deteriorate or the tropical cyclone makes landfall, the system weakens and eventually dissipates. A tropical cyclone can become extratropical as it moves toward higher latitudes if its energy source changes from heat released by condensation to differences in temperature between air masses. A tropical cyclone is usually not considered to become subtropical during its extratropical transition.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} on the stronger-sacramental <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> {{assess the}} sacraments as being {{of great importance}} to the evangelist. However, perhaps counterintuitively, some scholars who find fewer sacramental references, such as Udo Schnelle, view the references that they find as highly important as well. Schnelle in particular views John's sacramentalism as a counter to Docetist anti-sacramentalism. On the other hand, though he agrees that there are anti-Docetic passages, James Dunn views {{the absence of a}} Eucharistic institution narrative as evidence for an anti-sacramentalism in John, meant to warn against a conception of eternal life as dependent on physical ritual.|$|E

5|$|Optical {{heterodyne}} detection {{is an essential}} technique used in high-accuracy measurements of the frequencies of optical sources, {{as well as in}} the stabilization of their frequencies. Until a relatively few years ago, lengthy frequency chains were needed to connect the microwave frequency of a cesium or other atomic time source to optical frequencies. At each step of the chain, a frequency multiplier would be used to produce a harmonic of the frequency of that step, which would be compared by {{heterodyne detection}} with the next step (the output of a microwave source, far infrared laser, infrared laser, or visible laser). Each measurement of a single spectral line required several years of effort in the construction of a custom frequency chain. Currently, optical frequency combs have provided a much simpler method of measuring optical frequencies. If a mode-locked laser is modulated to form a train of pulses, its spectrum is seen to consist of the carrier frequency surrounded by a closely spaced comb of optical sideband frequencies with a spacing equal to the pulse repetition frequency (Fig.16). The pulse repetition frequency is locked to that of the frequency standard, and the frequencies of the comb elements at the red <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> are doubled and heterodyned with the frequencies of the comb elements at the blue <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> thus allowing the comb to serve as its own reference. In this manner, locking of the frequency comb output to an atomic standard can be performed in a single step. To measure an unknown frequency, the frequency comb output is dispersed into a spectrum. The unknown frequency is overlapped with the appropriate spectral segment of the comb and the frequency of the resultant heterodyne beats is measured.|$|E
5|$|Unless a star {{is being}} {{observed}} {{from the direction}} of its pole, sections of the surface have some amount of movement toward or away from the observer. The component of movement that is {{in the direction of the}} observer is called the radial velocity. For the portion of the surface with a radial velocity component toward the observer, the radiation is shifted to a higher frequency because of Doppler shift. Likewise the region that has a component moving away from the observer is shifted to a lower frequency. When the absorption lines of a star are observed, this shift at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum</b> causes the line to broaden. However, this broadening must be carefully separated from other effects that can increase the line width.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Showalter, {{writing in}} 1975, defended Starship Troopers, {{stating that the}} society {{depicted}} in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument {{is based on a}} literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, Starship Troopers being on the latter <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum.</b> It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as Stranger in a Strange Land (1961) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical attention than any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.|$|E

On the smaller <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>spectrum,</b> subwoofer drivers as small as 4-inch (10cm) may be used. Small subwoofer drivers in the 4-inch range are typically used in small computer speaker systems and compact home theatre subwoofer cabinets. The size of the driver and number of drivers in a cabinet depends {{on the design of}} the loudspeaker enclosure, the size of the cabinet, the desired sound pressure level, the lowest frequency targeted and the level of permitted distortion. The most common subwoofer driver sizes used for sound reinforcement in nightclubs, raves and pop/rock concerts are 10-, 12-, 15- and 18-inch models (25cm, 30cm, 38cm, and 45cm respectively). The largest available sound reinforcement subwoofers, 21-inch (53cm) drivers, are less commonly seen.|$|E
