25|$|In 2014, {{the actor}} decided {{to perform a}} risk-free item for the inaugural {{function}} of Magic Planet, a magic-themed complex at Kinfra Film and Video Park in Kazhakoottam, Trivandrum. It was a project of the Academy of Magical Sciences, founded by his teacher, the internationally acclaimed magician Gopinath Muthukad. The function was inaugurated by the then sitting Chief Minister of Kerala Oommen Chandy and the first magic performance was done by Mohanlal. In the trick, <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> girl on air. Opposition Leader V. S. Achuthanandan along with other supreme leaders and high-profile international magicians were present at the function.|$|E
2500|$|In 1832 Barada was in St. Louis {{when he was}} {{challenged}} to prove his strength. [...] <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> stone weighing 1,700 pounds, after which point {{the date of the}} feat and the weight were inscribed on the stone for future generations. [...] The stone is purported to still stand there. Barada was also widely regarded for his marksmanship. [...] Lore recorded his ability to shoot prairie chickens on the fly from horseback, as well as the ability to shoot two quail from every covey. [...] He was known as a fair hunter, one who never shot a bird on the ground.|$|E
2500|$|A {{story is}} {{preserved}} that {{once when he}} was a child, his father took him to the Kaaba, and asked him to pray before the idols. His father went away to attend to some other business, and Abu Bakr was left alone with the idols. Addressing an idol, Abu Bakr said [...] "O my God, I am in need of beautiful clothes; bestow them on me". The idol remained indifferent. Then he addressed another idol saying [...] "O God, give me some delicious food. See that I am so hungry". The idol remained cold. That exhausted the patience of young Abu Bakr. <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> stone, and addressing an idol said [...] "Here I am aiming a stone; if you are a god protect yourself". Abu Bakr hurled the stone at the idol and left the Kaaba. Thereafter, he never went to the Kaaba to pray to the idols.|$|E
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> {{sick man}} who dies after {{receiving}} communion but freed from fever.|$|R
6000|$|Campbell: [...] "But hold on, Amy!" [...] <b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> {{note from}} the desk. [...] "You've sent your copy. Here's the {{original}} now. She'll think you've been playing some joke on her." ...|$|R
6000|$|Oolibuck's broad visage {{expanded}} with <b>a</b> chuckle as <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>an</b> enormous wooden {{spoonful of}} soup to his ample mouth. [...] "Me tink de dogs of de Innuit [Esquimaux] make short work of dis kettle if 'e had 'im." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> paving-stone, {{and peered}} long and earnestly into the waters.|$|E
60|$|Kells's {{passionate and}} menacing gesture shut Pearce's lips. <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> hand, resignedly, and went out.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> second finger. How to learn? For it was {{learning}} {{that he had}} to do.|$|E
50|$|Jerry's cousin Merlin {{who looks}} {{identical}} to Jerry, but wears a black top hat, bow tie, and cloak and carries a walking stick, visits Jerry. The stick is actually <b>a</b> wand and <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> fence panel with a spell.|$|R
50|$|In {{his memoir}} Gasping for Airtime, Jay Mohr {{admitted}} that <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>an</b> entire routine from Rick Shapiro's act for a 1995 Saturday Night Live sketch. He stated that Shapiro sued {{the show and}} was financially compensated, but Shapiro later disputed that he received any compensation.|$|R
6000|$|These {{things are}} more {{familiar}} to M. Citroen {{than they are}} to me. He wants me to understand, {{but he does not}} realise that I would like a little leisure to wonder. What is interesting him just now, because it is the newest thing, is his method of paying his workers. <b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> hand gravely: [...] "I said, what we must do is abolish altogether the counting of change." ...|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> {{decanter}} and glass {{from a small}} table which Manuel had placed in the veranda.|$|E
60|$|At the bar McDermott's {{brown and}} knotty hand shook as <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> glass and gulped {{a drink of}} whisky.|$|E
6000|$|The insulted blood {{mounted to}} the little prince's cheek once more, and <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> steady and indignant gaze to the man's face and said-- ...|$|E
60|$|VIRAG: (A diabolic rictus {{of black}} {{luminosity}} contracting his visage, cranes his scraggy neck forward. <b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> mooncalf nozzle and howls.) Verfluchte Goim! He had a father, forty fathers. He never existed. Pig God! He had two left feet. He was Judas Iacchia, a Libyan eunuch, the pope's bastard. (He leans out on tortured forepaws, elbows bent rigid, his eye agonising in his flat skullneck and yelps over the mute world) A {{son of a}} whore. Apocalypse.|$|R
6000|$|... "Each {{of these}} pearls, my lord, is worth fifty {{thousand}} guineas," [...] said Mr. Amethyst, the fashionable jeweler, as <b>he</b> lightly <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> large shovelful from a convenient bin behind his counter.|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{say it is}} the Duke himself; but he {{has never}} durst meddle with my Lords before. All but the Hawk's tower is in Lorraine, and my Lord can bring a storm about his ears if <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> finger against us. A {{messenger}} would soon bring Banget and Steintour upon him. But never you fear, fair ladies, you have friends, and he will come to terms,' said good old Barbe, divided between pity for her guests and loyalty to her masters.|$|R
6000|$|Father Brown {{seemed to}} cogitate; <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> little whitebait on his fork. [...] "You are sure the grey {{envelope}} {{was in the}} left cupboard?" [...] he asked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'We want no hissin' heear,' {{said the}} leader of the band, as <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> heavy stick and struck the {{sibilant}} fowl a sharp rap on its head.|$|E
60|$|Carthoris {{eyed the}} food before him. It seemed real enough. <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> morsel to his lips. There was {{substance}} indeed. And flavour as well. Yes, even his palate was deceived.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, he {{can take}} a sack of wheat by the corners and snap every kernel of it clean out; <b>he</b> can <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> {{separator}} just as easy! You'd better brag when he's around." ...|$|R
50|$|Chopin is the Kelley family dog, a lap dog of {{indeterminate}} breed who {{is missing}} {{one of his}} hind legs. Ian received him as a gift when he was young, and it has since come out that Vicky, who cares deeply for deformed animals, told him that all dogs have three legs at the time. Chopin's role is mostly limited to physical comedy - an often-used gag {{is the fact that}} Chopin is unable to stay upright when <b>he</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> leg to urinate.|$|R
50|$|The narrator {{meets with}} a wee, wee man. <b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>an</b> {{enormous}} stone and throws it, {{and she thinks}} that if she were as strong as Wallace, she could have lifted it to her knee. She asks him where he lives, and he has her come with him to a hall {{where there is a}} lady, sometimes explicitly called the fairy queen, and her ladies, usually twenty-four and so beautiful that the ugliest would make a fit queen of Scotland, but they, and the wee, wee man, instantly vanish.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{plain to}} me that we must pairt, freen'," [...] said Swankie in a dogged manner, as <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> keg out of the boat {{and placed it on the}} ground.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know you}} did. If that darned Norse hadn't put {{his foot on}} that board you'd be doing this." [...] <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> handful of water to his swollen and aching head.|$|E
60|$|At length, when Ellen {{fell upon}} her knees, <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> small {{fragment}} of rock, {{and threw it}} down the cliff. It struck so near the pair, that it immediately drew the attention of both.|$|E
60|$|Once more I see him {{addressing}} a crowded meeting of City men in London, on a murky winter afternoon. In five minutes he has gripped his audience with his tale {{of things that}} are new to most of them, quite outside of their experience. <b>He</b> <b>lifts</b> <b>a</b> curtain as it were, and shows them the awful misery that lies often at their very office doors, and the duty which is theirs to aid the fallen and the suffering. It is a long address, very long, but none of the hearers are wearied.|$|R
60|$|Question {{and answer}} {{had been so}} rapid that all was over before <b>he</b> could <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> finger. <b>He</b> saw Irene's face alive with startled feeling, gave the {{slightest}} shake of his head, and slipped his arm through Fleur's.|$|R
6000|$|... "We've {{got to get}} out of this," [...] he said. His {{voice sounded}} like a man's whose throat has been {{scorched}} by many and long potations. It frightened him, but <b>he</b> limply <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> shaking paddle and shoved off.|$|R
60|$|Then stooping down <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> spear {{which lay}} upon {{the wall and}} hurled it at them so fiercely, that it transfixed the buckler {{of one of the}} {{soldiers}} and the arm behind the buckler.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, Rosina, what {{a pretty}} little silver cross you are wearing," [...] he said, and <b>he</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> curious {{ornament}} which {{hung from a}} chain on Rosina's neck. It consisted of seven drops of silver, set like this: ...|$|E
6000|$|Eugene, cowering {{close to}} the fire, needed not speech to make evident his awe of the battle-field. [...] "Injun spirits all round," [...] he whispered. [...] "Hear 'em? They cry to Pogos'." [...] <b>He</b> <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> hand in warning.|$|E
6000|$|Instead of answering, <b>he</b> gently <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> long lock of my hair, {{which hung}} {{at the side}} of my neck. (My head, I should add, had been dressed that evening on the old-fashioned plan, by my aunt's maid--to please my aunt.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Boys,' 'e said, ''ere's another feenancier!' {{and they}} took 'im out there and then, and 'ung 'im on a lam'pose down the street. <b>'E</b> never <b>lifted</b> <b>a</b> finger to resist. After I tole on 'im 'e never said a word...." ...|$|R
50|$|Davis {{has cast}} several votes {{in favor of}} legalizing medical marijuana. In 2015, <b>he</b> voted to <b>lift</b> <b>a</b> ban on travel to Cuba.|$|R
