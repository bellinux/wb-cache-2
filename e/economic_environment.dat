5|$|A {{native of}} Ohio, Gottesman studied {{psychology}} for his {{undergraduate and graduate}} degrees, became {{a faculty member at}} various universities, and spent most of his career at the University of Virginia and the University of Minnesota. He is known for researching schizophrenia in identical twins to document the contributions of genetics and the family, social, cultural, and <b>economic</b> <b>environment</b> to the onset, progress, and inter-generational transmission of the disorder. Gottesman has worked with researchers to analyze hospital records and conduct follow-up interviews of twins where one or both were schizophrenic. He has also researched the effects of genetics and the environment on human violence and variations in human intelligence. Gottesman and co-researcher James Shields introduced the word epigenetics—the control of genes by biochemical signals modified by the environment {{from other parts of the}} genome—to the field of psychiatric genetics.|$|E
5|$|Being a free city, Sélestat {{attracted}} settlers {{from the}} region who sought protection, freedom and a thriving <b>economic</b> <b>environment.</b> The first city wall, which had become too constricting, was replaced in 1280, and a third wall had to be erected in the 16th century as the city grew. At {{the end of the}} Middle Ages, the population was estimated at between 5,000 and 6,000. It was then the fourth largest Alsatian town after Strasbourg (18,000), Colmar and Haguenau (6,000 each). The local economy reached its zenith around 1500. It was centered on shipping and trade (mainly hay, cereals, wine, fish, glass, iron and salt). As the road network was poor and dangerous, goods transited via the Ill river.|$|E
5|$|During the Tudor and Stuart periods, horse {{ownership}} {{was more}} widespread in Britain than in continental Europe, but it suffered {{a decline in}} the harsh <b>economic</b> <b>environment</b> of the late 16th and early 17th centuries. With economic recovery, the number of horse owners increased again. Travel became more popular, along with the hiring of horses, although a common practice at the time was for a traveller to buy a horse for a journey, and then sell it on arrival at his destination. Horses had been raced in Britain for hundreds of years by the time of King James VI of Scotland (1567– 1625), but he brought the sport as it is known today into England from Scotland while he was king of both countries (1603– 1625); he organised public races in a number of places, and continued to import quality animals aimed at the development of a new, lighter, faster type of horse.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{considers}} Bayesian and Nash {{implementation in}} ex-change <b>economic</b> <b>environments</b> with state dependent preferences and feasible sets. We fully characterize Bayesian implementability for both diuse and non-diuse information structures. We show that, in exchange <b>economic</b> <b>environments</b> {{with three or}} more individuals, a social choice set is Bayesian implementable {{if and only if}} closure, non-confiscatority, Bayesian monoto-nicity, and Bayesian incentive compatibility are satisfied. As such, it im-proves upon and contains as special cases previously known results about Nash and Bayesian implementation in exchange <b>economic</b> <b>environments.</b> We show that the individual rationality and continuity conditions, imposed in Hurwicz et al. [12], can be weakened to the non-confiscatority and can be dropped, respectively, for Nash implementation. Thus we also give a full characterization for Nash implementation when endowments and prefer-ences are both unknown to the designer. ...|$|R

5|$|For {{the first}} time in its five-year operation, the Company {{reported}} a net income of NT$5.78 billion, with earnings per share of NT$0.59. Between 2010 and 2011, revenues increased by 16.65% from NT$27.64 billion to NT$32.24 billion, with operating costs and expenses (excluding depreciation and amortization) rising by only 4.98%. Over the same period of time, gross profit totaled NT$12.98 billion (an increase of 30.32%), income from operations totaled NT$12.06 billion (an increase of 32.93%) and EBITDA totaled NT$22.73 billion (an increase of 22.34%). 2011 gross profit, income from operation and EBITDA were all record highs. Since commencing operations in 2007, THSRC has had a significant influence on Taiwan’s economy and on the lives of its people. In 2011, the Company continued to pursue sustainable growth aligned with the interests of shareholders and society, achieving record profits even amid a challenging <b>economic</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1870, during Sarmiento's presidency, {{total debt}} {{amounted}} to 48 million gold pesos. A year later, it had almost doubled. Avellaneda became president {{after winning the}} 1874 presidential election. The coalition that supported his candidature became the Partido Autonomista Nacional, Argentina's first national party; all the presidents until 1916 would come from this party. Avellaneda undertook the tough actions {{needed to get the}} debt under control. In 1876 convertibility was suspended. The inflation rate rose to almost 20% in the following year, but the ratio of debt to GDP plummeted. Avellaneda's administration was the first to deliver a balance in the fiscal accounts since the mid-1850s. Avellaneda passed on to his successor, Julio Argentino Roca, a much more manageable <b>economic</b> <b>environment.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{some studies}} {{suggested}} that menu costs {{are too small}} to have much of an aggregate impact, Laurence Ball and David Romer (1990) showed that real rigidities could interact with nominal rigidities to create significant disequilibrium. Real rigidities occur whenever a firm is slow to adjust its real prices in response to a changing <b>economic</b> <b>environment.</b> For example, a firm can face real rigidities if it has market power or if its costs for inputs and wages are locked-in by a contract. Ball and Romer argued that real rigidities in the labor market keep a firm's costs high, which makes firms hesitant to cut prices and lose revenue. The expense created by real rigidities combined with the menu cost of changing prices makes it less likely that firm will cut prices to a market clearing level.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the implications of}} {{a particular type of}} heterogeneity [...] one which characterizes a large number of <b>economic</b> <b>environments,</b> but that has not received any systematic treatment in the literature.

The paper begins by providing a general framework for the analysis of environments characterized by this heterogeneity and then shows how this framework can be used to help understand a wide variety of <b>economic</b> <b>environments.</b> Particular applications considered are, near rationality, network externalities, and models of reputation.

40|$|Abstract: In {{standard}} <b>economic</b> <b>environments,</b> axiomatic foundations {{are developed}} for the two aggregate Hicksian consumer surplus measures- aggregate willingness-to-pay (compensating variation) and aggregate willingness-to-accept (equivalent variation) - as ordinal social welfare indices, without the imposition of any extraneous assumptions such as the interpersonal utility comparison and the expected utility hypothesis. Each of the measures {{is characterized by the}} three axioms in Arrovian form (Pareto, anonymity and independence). Among the axioms, the same Pareto and anonymity axioms are shared by the two measures, but each independence axiom is specific to each of the measures. Hence each measure has a secure axiomatic foundation as a social welfare index within the <b>economic</b> <b>environments,</b> and the differences of social orderings determined by the two measures are explained only by the difference of each independence axiom...|$|R
