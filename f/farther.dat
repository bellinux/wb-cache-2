5|$|As traders sailed <b>farther</b> east, the voyages became {{longer and}} more expensivea Smaller {{enterprises}} were merged into larger ones. During the 1780s, Grigory Shelikhov began to stand out {{as one of the}} most important traders through the Shelikhov-Golikov Company. In 1784, Shelikhov founded the first permanent Russian settlement in North America, at Three Saints Bay on Kodiak Island. Shelikhov envisioned a continual extension of the Russian maritime fur trade, with trading posts being set up <b>farther</b> and <b>farther</b> along the coast all the way to California. He sought exclusive control of the trade, and in 1788 Empress CatherineII decided to grant his company a monopoly only over the area it already occupied. Other traders were free to compete elsewhere. Catherine's decision was issued as the imperial ukase (proclamation) of September 28, 1788.|$|E

5|$|For another {{distance}} debate see Polaris#Distance, {{also with}} a different measurement from Hipparcus, although this time it suggested a <b>farther</b> distance.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{from the}} {{remnants}} of the depression spread into states <b>farther</b> east, including Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee.|$|E

5|$|Bolesław's expansionist {{policies}} were costly to the Polish state {{and were not}} always successful. He lost, for example, the economically crucial <b>Farther</b> Pomerania in 1005 together with its new bishopric in Kołobrzeg; the region had previously been conquered with great effort by Mieszko.|$|E
5|$|During the Ohio Constitutional Convention in 1802, {{the delegates}} {{allegedly}} received reports from a fur trapper that Lake Michigan extended significantly <b>farther</b> south than {{had previously been}} believed (or mapped). Thus, {{it was possible that}} an east–west line extending east from Lake Michigan's southern tip might intersect Lake Erie somewhere east of Maumee Bay, or worse, might not intersect the lake at all; the <b>farther</b> south that Lake Michigan actually extended, the more land Ohio would lose, perhaps even the entire Lake Erie shoreline west of Pennsylvania.|$|E
5|$|During the War of the Third Coalition, Vukassovich led a {{division}} in Archduke Charles' Army of Italy. His division consisted of 14 line and Grenz battalions and four squadrons organized into two brigades led by Hannibal Sommariva and Karl Hillinger. Tasked with guarding {{the east bank}} of the Adige opposite Verona and maintaining a link with Johann von Hiller's corps in the Tyrol, he garrisoned the suburb of San Giorgio with two battalions while holding six battalions <b>farther</b> back in the hills. The rest of his troops watched the river <b>farther</b> north.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, ionization energy, and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found <b>farther</b> from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower ionization energy because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases <b>farther</b> down the group.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{the existence of}} lakes of liquid water entirely encased in Europa's icy outer shell and distinct from a liquid ocean thought to exist <b>farther</b> down beneath the ice shell. If confirmed, the lakes could be yet another potential habitat for life.|$|E
5|$|<b>Farther</b> {{down the}} {{southeast}} slope of Adams, the Washington State Department of Natural Resources (DNR) has two campgrounds along Bird Creek: Bird Creek Campground and Island Cabin Campground. Island Cabin {{is also used}} in winter by snowmobilers.|$|E
5|$|For {{most of its}} orbit, it is even <b>farther</b> {{from the}} Sun than at present, with its {{aphelion}} estimated at 937AU (31 times Neptune's distance), {{making it one of}} the most distant-known objects in the Solar System other than long-period comets.|$|E
5|$|Forming at 31° N, {{the storm}} formed <b>farther</b> north {{than any other}} Pacific {{tropical}} cyclone at the time, though, in 2000, Tropical Storm Wene formed <b>farther</b> to the north. The cyclone marked the first known occurrence of a mid-Pacific upper tropospheric low developing into a tropical cyclone, though Tropical Storm Fausto in 2002 redeveloped in a similar occurrence to the hurricane. The cyclone attained hurricane status at 40° N, a record for a Pacific hurricane. Only Tropical Storm Dot in 1970, Hurricane John in 1994, Tropical Depression Guillermo in 1997, and Tropical Storm Wene in 2000 were tropical cyclones north of the latitude, of which only John was a hurricane; none maintained tropical cyclone status further north than the cyclone.|$|E
5|$|Grandma's Marathon is run {{every summer}} along the scenic North Shore of Lake Superior, and the Twin Cities Marathon winds around lakes and the Mississippi River {{during the peak}} of the fall color season. <b>Farther</b> north, Eveleth is the {{location}} of the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Karl {{was unusual}} in several aspects. It {{developed}} {{late in the}} hurricane season, which runs from June 1 through November 30, over waters colder than the standard limit for tropical cyclone formation. It marked the farthest-north development of a November tropical or subtropical cyclone on record. While the 1991 unnamed hurricane was <b>farther</b> north, it became a subtropical storm late on October 31, and had moved south by November 1. Karl attained Category 1 hurricane status <b>farther</b> north than any other storm (in any month) until the 1991 unnamed hurricane became a hurricane at a higher latitude. The storm's record was also surpassed by Hurricane Noel in 2001. Karl was reported {{at the time to}} be the farthest-east hurricane during the last 10days of the month of November. Additionally, it maintained hurricane intensity until reaching 45.0°N, at which point it became extratropical; only Hurricane Lois in 1966 lasted as a hurricane <b>farther</b> north in the month of November.|$|E
5|$|I-87 {{is part of}} a major {{strategic}} corridor between New York City, {{the largest}} metropolitan area in the U.S., and Montreal, the second largest metropolitan area in Canada. The New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) considers the route important for commerce, as it connects with numerous highways in the region and serves approximately 80 million people along the Mid-Atlantic States, New England, and Quebec. Motorists can connect to multiple highways on I-87 to travel <b>farther</b> south along I-95 through the mid-Atlantic states, or through numerous other highways to travel <b>farther</b> east into New England.|$|E
5|$|In this {{championship}} {{version of}} the game, a finish line is set up <b>farther</b> downstream {{and the winner is}} the first to pass this point. The competition originally took place every January, but it was moved to March due to icy weather in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Lastarria has {{produced}} a large landslide deposit as well as flows of molten sulfur. A progressive uplift of the terrain around Lastarria and <b>farther</b> south has been recognized.|$|E
5|$|Located to the {{southwest}} of Aliso Creek, Sulphur Creek historically lay in {{the territory of the}} Acjachemen Indian group, whose main population center was actually <b>farther</b> south, at the confluence of San Juan and Trabuco creeks.|$|E
5|$|On January 19, 2006, {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} {{to explore the}} Kuiper belt, New Horizons, was launched, which flew by Pluto on July 14, 2015. Beyond the Pluto flyby, the mission's goal was to locate and investigate other, <b>farther</b> objects in the Kuiper belt.|$|E
5|$|Other {{volcanic}} activity {{occurred in the}} region <b>farther</b> east, on Hardy Peninsula and some surrounding capes and islands during the Miocene; potassium-argon dating has yielded ages of 18 and 21 million years ago. These volcanic systems may indicate that the Antarctic Plate is subducting beneath the Scotia Plate.|$|E
5|$|The Brahmaputra River {{is often}} {{considered}} the natural {{division between the}} two subspecies, where it makes a curve around {{the eastern end of}} the Himalayas, although some authors suggest A. f. fulgens extends <b>farther</b> eastward, into China.|$|E
5|$|The Scotch-Irish began immigrating to the Middle Colonies {{in waves}} after 1717. They {{primarily}} pushed <b>farther</b> into the western frontier of the colonies, where they repeatedly confronted the Indians. Other groups included the French Huguenots, Welsh, Dutch, Swedes, Swiss, and Scots Highlanders.|$|E
5|$|The artistic work, {{the icons}} to {{represents}} {{ideas and the}} motifs in Badami Cave 4, states Lisa Owens, resembles those of nearby Aihole Jain caves and much <b>farther</b> north Ellora Caves Jain caves in northern Maharashtra.|$|E
5|$|The <b>farther</b> forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less the front wheel has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the <b>farther</b> back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over the front wheel.|$|E
5|$|The {{fire was}} principally {{expanding}} {{north and west}} by dawn on Monday, 3 September, the turbulence of the fire storm pushing the flames both <b>farther</b> south and <b>farther</b> north than the day before. The spread to the south was mostly halted by the river, but it had torched the houses on London Bridge and was threatening to cross the bridge and endanger the borough of Southwark on the south bank of the river. Southwark was preserved by a pre-existent firebreak on the bridge, a long gap between the buildings which had saved {{the south side of}} the Thames in the fire of 1632 and now did so again. Flying embers started a fire in Southwark but it was quickly stopped.|$|E
5|$|The {{manipulation}} {{of time at}} higher latitudes (for example Iceland, Nunavut or Alaska) has little impact on daily life, because the length of day and night changes more extremely throughout the seasons (in comparison to other latitudes), and thus sunrise and sunset times are significantly out of phase with standard working hours regardless of manipulations of the clock. DST is also of little use for locations near the equator, because these regions see only a small variation in daylight {{in the course of}} the year. The effect also varies according to how far east or west the location is within its time zone, with locations <b>farther</b> east inside the time zone benefiting more from DST than locations <b>farther</b> west in the same time zone.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no direct}} {{replacement}} to Hubble as an ultraviolet and visible light space telescope, because near-term space telescopes {{do not duplicate}} Hubble's wavelength coverage (near-ultraviolet to near-infrared wavelengths), instead concentrating on the <b>farther</b> infrared bands. These bands are preferred for studying high redshift and low-temperature objects, objects generally older and <b>farther</b> away in the universe. These wavelengths are also difficult or impossible to study from the ground, justifying {{the expense of a}} space-based telescope. Large ground-based telescopes can image some of the same wavelengths as Hubble, sometimes challenge HST in terms of resolution by using adaptive optics (AO), have much larger light-gathering power, and can be upgraded more easily, but cannot yet match Hubble's excellent resolution over a wide field of view with the very dark background of space.|$|E
5|$|This {{multiplication}} {{of effects}} {{at the very}} outset of the play served as a shock and foretaste of what the audience would find <b>farther</b> along.|$|E
5|$|With a few exceptions, the <b>farther</b> {{a planet}} or belt {{is from the}} Sun, the larger the {{distance}} between its orbit and the orbit of the next nearer object to the Sun. For example, Venus is approximately 0.33 AU <b>farther</b> out from the Sun than Mercury, whereas Saturn is 4.3 AU out from Jupiter, and Neptune lies 10.5 AU out from Uranus. Attempts {{have been made to}} determine a relationship between these orbital distances (for example, the Titius–Bode law), but no such theory has been accepted. The images {{at the beginning of this}} section show the orbits of the various constituents of the Solar System on different scales.|$|E
5|$|With a {{land area}} of 83.9 square miles (217.3km²), Seattle is the northernmost city {{with at least}} 500,000 people in the United States, <b>farther</b> north than Canadian cities such as Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, {{at about the same}} {{latitude}} as Salzburg, Austria.|$|E
5|$|A major crustal lineament {{known as}} the Archibarca lineament intersects the main {{volcanic}} arc at Lastarria. Other volcanic centres such as Galán and ore deposits are also found on this lineament. The intersection between this lineament and the arc may act as a weakness zone that focuses the ascent of magma. <b>Farther</b> south lie volcanoes such as Wheelwright Caldera and Cerro Blanco, the last of which shows evidence of recent unrest.|$|E
5|$|A {{sport for}} two players or more, in the {{traditional}} version of poohsticks the participants must drop a stick simultaneously on the upstream side of a bridge and run to the other side. The winner is the player whose stick first appears {{on the other side}} of the bridge. Alternatively, players may decide upon a starting point on a river and a finish line <b>farther</b> downstream. The winner is the player whose stick first passes the finishing point.|$|E
5|$|Across Micronesia, {{impact from}} the typhoon was fairly limited. Winds on Nukuoro were {{estimated}} at 45–75km/h (30–45mph), resulting in minor {{damage to buildings}} and crops. Losses on the atoll reached $10,000. Lukunor, located <b>farther</b> west, experienced similar winds; however, damage was slightly more severe. Notable coastal impact took place, with portions of the dock and sea wall damaged. Damage across Lukunor and nearby islands amounted to $20,000.|$|E
5|$|After {{the losses}} of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February 1862, Confederate General Albert Sidney Johnston withdrew his forces into western Tennessee, {{northern}} Mississippi, and Alabama to reorganize. Johnston established his base at Corinth, Mississippi, {{the site of}} a major railroad junction and strategic transportation link between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mississippi River, but left the Union troops with access into southern Tennessee and points <b>farther</b> south via the Tennessee River.|$|E
5|$|Airport {{officials}} estimate that around a third of airline tickets purchased by area residents are for travel from other airports. Competition includes Piedmont Triad International Airport near Greensboro, North Carolina, as an alternate and others <b>farther</b> away which have service from Southwest Airlines or international flights. However, aviation industry consultant Michael Boyd compared Roanoke's level of air service favorably to similarly sized cities.|$|E
