40|$|Some {{fear that}} {{requiring}} litigation of interspousal torts in a divorce action may undermine the policy premises of no-fault divorce. Fear of res judicata may encourage divorce litigants to scrape the 2 ̆ 2 {{bottom of the}} barrel 2 ̆ 2 and assert every conceivable tort claim that arose during the marriage. Divorce litigation will thus become more bitter and hostile than it already is. Others fear that divorce litigation will become unmanageable as tort claims and third parties are added to joined tort/divorce litigation. The thesis {{of this article is}} that, despite these concerns, as a general rule, spouses should be required to litigate tort claims against each other that arose during the marriage relationship in the divorce action, or lose them. This proposed rule flows from the general thrust of both modern procedural and divorce reform, which encourage resolution of all grievances between a divorcing couple in a single proceeding. While claims for tort and divorce serve different social purposes, the facts establishing both claims and relief the plaintiff receives are inextricably intertwined. Modern rules of procedure generally compel parties to join such interconnected claims. The problems that the opponents of mandatory joinder foresee can be solved in a modern procedural system; careful judicial administration can prevent loss of jury trial rights and inequitable application or undue complication of the divorce action. Modern courts are capable of dealing with claims based on different legal theories arising out of a single <b>factual</b> <b>base</b> in one litigation...|$|E

40|$|The methodological {{strategies}} and tactics of behavior analysis {{have met with}} great success toward establishing a natural science of behavior within modern psychology. The experimental analysis of behavior has established a rigorous <b>factual</b> <b>base</b> on which a resulting technology of behavior is founded. These technological successes, which shore up the conceptual and philosophical position called Radical Behaviorism, are functionally related to our insistence upon natural science research methods appropriate to our field, namely, the complex interaction between organism and environment under the causal mode of selection by consequences. However, behavior does not occur in a vacuum, but in the material context of regional, national, and international cultural practices. In response, several behavior analysts are calling for the same natural science orientation with which to establish a natural science of culture. It is widely agreed that cultural selection is not amenable to an "analysis by extrapolation" from the level of operant selection, just as behavior analysts balk at attempts to analyze and explain behavior by extrapolation from the level of natural selection. Concerned behavior analysts have entered into an interdisciplinary collusion with anthropologists whose methods are comparable to the natural science methodology inherent in a science of behavior. Jerome Ulman, in a timely attempt at clarification and synthesis, has proposed a natural science framework within which a non-reductionistic science of culture may be, in time, achieved. This conceptual analysis, called Functional Materialism, is a wide-ranging theoretical and ontological position which, we feel, will be the milestone with which not only the rising science of culture will be guided, but also the student of disciplines concerned with sciences whose subject matter is amenable to selection by consequences.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 The {{dissertation}} {{conducts a}} parallel {{study of a}} prominent Chinese poet from the early medieval period named Tao Yuanming and William Wordsworth, {{one of the founding}} figures of British Romanticism, with the aim to suggest novel connections between and bring together into a constructive dialogue two of the world's major literary cultures that are still to a large extent mutually indifferent, if not mutually exclusive, in today's academic discourse. The chapter design is roughly symmetrical. For the named dialogue to take place, the dissertation sets out to break down the widely current dichotomy of fact and fiction in East-West literary studies by critiquing the hermeneutic approaches predominating in traditional China and the modern West, which seem in a balanced view either excessively literal-minded or to lean too much toward a denial of the <b>factual</b> <b>base</b> of the kind of lyric poetry that is manifestly autobiographical, a poetic genre in which both our master-writers obviously excelled. The remaining chapters provide novel readings of selected writings by the two poets in order to address {{some of the problems that}} are first adumbrated and yet left unresolved in the opening chapter, especially those concerning the authorial stance of Tao Yuanming and Wordsworth in their respective writings. Although discussions of the two writers are kept strictly separate in the body of the dissertation, with each chapter focused on issues of apparently local interest, the chapters do constitute a comparison, albeit of a rather oblique sort, when read together as a sequence. As a juxtapositional comparison, it attempts not only to represent and reproduce for the reader to the extent possible within the bounds of the dissertator's interest and abilities the actual, defamiliarizing experience of reading interculturally, but also to restore considerations of the author to their rightful place and demonstrate the practicality of an authorial approach in the study of literature, especially of autobiographical writing...|$|E

The Oregonian and the broadcast media have focused a number of stories and reports on racial relations and racial tensions. The broad-based strategic planning efforts of the Civic Index project (1989 - 90) and the Portland Future Focus planning program (1990 - 91) have pinpointed racial and ethnic relations {{as one of the}} central issues that will determine {{the quality of life in}} the growing metropolis. The City Club of Portland is preparing a series of reports on 2 ̆ 2 Racial and Ethnic Relations in Portland 2 ̆ 2 with attention to areas such as education, public welfare, law enforcement, and civic participation. It is important that these discussions are grounded on a solid <b>factual</b> <b>base</b> that answers such fundamental questions as 2 ̆ 2 who 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 where. 2 ̆ 2 As a contribution to the discussion, the School of Urban and Public Affairs at Portland State University has prepared this 2 ̆ 2 census profile 2 ̆ 2 of minority groups in the tri-county Portland area. Despite some well-publicized problems with response rates, the 1990 Census is the most thorough, current, and comprehensive source of information for comparing the characteristics of ethnic groups. This report summarizes information on four racial groups and one ethnic minority group. The racial groups, to use the census terminology, are 2 ̆ 2 white, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 black, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 American Indian, Eskimo, and Aleut, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 Asian and Pacific Islander. 2 ̆ 2 The one ethnic group consists of persons of 2 ̆ 2 Hispanic origin. 2 ̆ 2 Since Hispanics may be of any race, members of this group overlap the racial categories.
