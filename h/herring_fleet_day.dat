50|$|The Lydia Eva is {{the last}} {{surviving}} steam drifter of the <b>herring</b> fishing <b>fleet</b> based in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. The Great Yarmouth <b>herring</b> <b>fleet</b> had made the town the major herring port {{in the world in}} the early part of the 20th century. She is listed as part of the National Historic Fleet.|$|R
5000|$|To {{the south}} of Loch of Tankerness, is the Hall of Tankerness. This is a 19th-century farm steading {{on the site of}} the 12th-century {{drinking}} hall of Erling of Tankerness. [...] Nearby is a pier, once used by the <b>herring</b> <b>fleets.</b>|$|R
5000|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century fishing predominated. During the 1829 floods known as [...] "The Muckle Spate" [...] five Findhorn fishing boats rescued Forres residents. For a few years (1860-9) there was a branch railway line to the village to take {{advantage}} of the <b>herring</b> <b>fleet.</b>|$|R
50|$|Within three <b>days,</b> Collaart's <b>fleet</b> {{located a}} <b>herring</b> <b>fleet</b> {{numbering}} 160 under the guard {{of a single}} man-of-war, armed with 39 guns and an 85-men crew. Easily disabling the escort, 74 vessels were either sunk or set afire with the surviving vessels escaping to the Vlie.|$|R
5000|$|In spring 1622, De With was {{appointed}} lieutenant on Schapenham's vessel. When the latter became ill, De With functioned as commandeur, acting captain, of the Gelderland during convoy {{duty in the}} Baltic. When Schapenham recovered, De With served {{for a short period}} on the Maurits to protect the <b>herring</b> <b>fleet.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sheephaven Bay (Cuan na gCaorach) is a broad, shallow inlet on {{the north}} coast of County Donegal, Ireland. Bounded by the peninsulae of Rosguill, {{to the east and}} Horn Head (Corran Binne) to the west, the bay is {{relatively}} protected from the full force of the Atlantic Ocean, and has supported a vibrant <b>herring</b> <b>fleet.</b>|$|R

50|$|Wylde Swan is a fast {{sailing vessel}} {{originally}} built in Germany in 1920 as a steam ship. She {{was designed to}} work with the German <b>herring</b> <b>fleet,</b> collecting the <b>herring</b> at sea and transporting the fish to market at speed to get the best price. To maximise speed she was built long and narrow, and in keeping with her day had a vertical stem and counter stern.|$|R
50|$|Helmsdale is {{a fishing}} port at the estuary of the River Helmsdale, and {{was once the}} home {{of one of the}} largest <b>herring</b> <b>fleets</b> in Europe. The river itself is well known for its fishing. West Helmsdale lies across the river from the main village above the railway station; Old Helmsdale is {{immediately}} to the north while East Helmsdale is a settlement less than a mile to the east.|$|R
50|$|When Charles Kingsley was a boy, {{his father}} was rector of Clovelly, a small seaside parish {{on the coast of}} north Devon. Kingsley was often present when the <b>herring</b> <b>fleet</b> was put out to sea, an event often {{accompanied}} by a short religious ceremony for which the fishermen, their wives and their families were all present. Kingsley recalled the story {{at the end of a}} weary day and wrote the poem.|$|R
50|$|The 2015 herring season saw {{a crisis}} erupt over a long-simmering {{dispute between the}} Heiltsuk and Canada (DFO). Citing concern for the stocks and Heiltsuk rights, as well as taking issue with DFO {{predictive}} models, the Heiltsuk occupied the local DFO office for 4 days. The crisis abated when {{the remainder of the}} commercial <b>herring</b> <b>fleet</b> departed and the Heiltsuk and Canada agreed to discuss the next seasons management.|$|R

50|$|Downings {{used to be}} a {{significant}} fishing port with a substantial <b>herring</b> <b>fleet.</b> Today, however, the economy survives on tourism, and only three crab boats make a traditional living from the sea. Situated as it is in Sheephaven Bay, one of the safest anchorages on the northwest Irish coast, Downings has begun to cater for international game fishermen, the northwest of Ireland being on the migration route of bluefin tuna and other game species.|$|R
40|$|The Herring Industry Board {{attempted}} to modernise the British <b>herring</b> <b>fleet</b> throughout the postwar period. It employed three main economic and technical instruments: research and development, grants and loans to support investment, and minimum prices and fishing subsidies. Although the Board's successes were modest during the 1940 s and 1950 s, its efforts helped encourage radical {{innovation in the}} mid- 1960 s. Unfortunately, the highly efficient fleet it helped establish contributed to the overfishing of herring stocks that precipitated the fishery's closure in the 1970 s. ...|$|R
50|$|Drifters {{preserved}} as museum ships include Lydia Eva, a steam drifter of the <b>herring</b> fishing <b>fleet</b> {{based in}} Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, and Reaper, a restored Scottish Fifie herring drifter at the Scottish Fisheries Museum.|$|R
50|$|He {{was also}} {{involved}} in international law. In 1902 he acted as one of five arbitrators at The Hague in the Pious Fund of the Californias dispute between the United States and Mexico, the first dispute between states arbitrated by the Permanent Court of Arbitration. In 1904 he was the British legal assessor on the commission to investigate the Dogger Bank incident where the Russian navy accidentally attacked a British <b>herring</b> <b>fleet</b> in the North Sea. He {{was involved in the}} second Hague Conference (1907). In 1908/1909 he was an arbitrator between France and Germany over a case where France had seized deserters (including some German citizens) from German diplomatic protection.|$|R
50|$|Arising new fibers such as Sisal and Manila opened new {{technical}} possibilities. Starting from 1890 on, the Herkulestauwerk (lit. Hercules cordage) {{was used}} for dragging nets for fishing. At that time Bremen-Vegesack, the former company headquarters, was the port of registry of Europe's biggest <b>herring</b> <b>fleet.</b> Starting from 1920 basic researches for standardisation and computation of ropes were established. In the year 1947, the first ropes made of chemical fibres were produced. 1978, the enterprise shifts its head office to Bremen-Blumenthal. 1997, a production is set up in Slovakia, 1999 the enterprise existed 175 years. In his hometown Vegesack (part of Bremen today), the Georg-Gleistein-Strasse wears the founder's name.|$|R

40|$|Observers {{were placed}} on pelagic vessels in the Scottish {{fisheries}} for mackerel (Scomber scombrus), herring (Clupea harengus), “maatje” herring (herring caught just before their first spawning) and argentines (Argentina silus) to monitor by-catch composition and discarding practices. A total of 67 days was spent at sea, 11 on the argentine fleet, 28 on the <b>herring</b> <b>fleet,</b> 12 on the “maatje ” <b>herring</b> <b>fleet</b> and 16 on the mackerel fleet. The level of by-catch generally ranged from < 1 % to around 2. 5 % of the total catch. The argentine fishery took {{a significant proportion of}} blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) (approx. 10 % of the overall catch) but this was landed and sold in the market. The greatest range of by-catch species was found in the argentine fishery, including 11 species of fish and one species of squid. Discarding rates in the fisheries varied, with herring and argentine fisheries showing no discards, the mackerel fishery a discard rate of around 4 % and the “maatje ” herring fishery a discard rate of around 11 %. By-catches included small numbers of gannets (Morus bassanus) but no marine mammals. If the sampled trips were representative, results indicate that marine mammal by-catch events typically occur during less than one in 20 hauls in the fisheries studied. A larger scale study is needed to confirm this. Cetaceans were sighted {{in the vicinity of the}} fishing boats during 4 % of observed fishing activities. © 2002 Ifremer/CNRS/Inra/IRD/Cemagref/Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.

50|$|Before {{the lakes}} {{on either side}} of De Rijp were pumped dry, De Rijp was a port town with {{merchant}} ships that travelled the high seas on trade routes. The town had a medium-sized <b>herring</b> <b>fleet,</b> and searched for whales with larger ships. Rijper vessels travelled regularly to Spitsbergen. After the success of the polders near Alkmaar and Egmond, plans were formed to make polders of the other lakes in North Holland, including the ones on both sides of De Rijp. In 1605 De Rijp split off from Graft and became a relief center for the effort to pump the Beemster dry. The project was run by the architect-engineer Jan Leeghwater, who had been born in De Rijp and even designed the Town hall.|$|R
40|$|Stochastic {{frontier}} {{models are}} often employed to estimate fishing vessel technical efficiency. Under certain assumptions, these models yield efficiency measures that are means of truncated normal distributions. We {{argue that these}} measures are flawed, and use the results of Horrace (2005) to estimate efficiency for 39 vessels in the Northeast Atlantic <b>herring</b> <b>fleet,</b> based on each vessel's probability of being efficient. We develop a subset selection technique to identify groups of efficient vessels at pre-specified probability levels. When homogeneous production is assumed, inferential inconsistencies exist between our methods and the methods of ranking {{the means of the}} technical inefficiency distributions for each vessel. When production is allowed to be heterogeneous, these inconsistencies are mitigated. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
5000|$|John Grierson {{is widely}} {{considered}} to be the godfather of documentary film, he has also been attributed to have coined the name [...] "documentary". He was born in Scotland in 1898. Grierson was the founder of a new movement of documentary film in the 1930s. He started the Empire Marketing Board Film Unit, and in 1933 the GPO Film Unit, gathering together such diverse and exciting talents as Humphrey Jennings, Paul Rotha and Alberto Cavalcanti. [...] His ground-breaking work on the Scottish <b>herring</b> <b>fleet,</b> Drifters, had its premiere in 1929 alongside the first British showing of Sergei Eisenstein’s Battleship Potemkin. In 1936, he produced the celebrated Night Mail, directed by Harry Watt with script by W.H. Auden and score by Benjamin Britten.|$|R

2500|$|The herring {{fisheries}} were {{severely damaged}} by French privateers during the War of the Spanish Succession. This caused {{a collapse of}} the industry {{in the first decade}} of the 18th century, from which the industry did not recover. The size of the Enkhuizen fleet halved compared to the previous century. A second sharp contraction of the <b>herring</b> <b>fleet</b> occurred in the years 1756–61. This was due to an equally sharp reduction in revenue in these years. Meanwhile, foreign competitors profited from easier access to the fishing grounds (Scandinavians), lower wages (Scots), or protection (English). They also were not bound to the Dutch regulations that aimed to guarantee the quality of the Dutch product. This challenge induced the industry to go [...] "up market" [...] by improving quality further, thus being able to charge premium prices.|$|R

40|$|Get Up And Tie Your Fingers', {{originally}} {{written by}} Ann Coburn as {{a play for}} three actresses, is a fiction set against a real event, the Eyemouth Fishing Disaster of 1881. Women from fishing communities along {{the east coast of}} Scotland and England, the 'herring lassies' as they were known, would follow the <b>herring</b> <b>fleets</b> down the coast to meet the catch at each port of call. With knives at the ready, they gutted, salted, and barreled the 'silver darlings', the bountiful herring that were destined for markets across the world. Echoing the journey of the herring lassies, the production took the story of three such women - Jean, Janet, and young Molly - back to the communities from which they sprang and gave members of those communities the opportunity to create and participate in a piece of theatre alongside a professional production team...|$|R

40|$|There is {{a growing}} {{resource}} economics literature, concerning the estimation of the technical efficiency of fishing vessels utilizing the stochastic frontier model. In these models, vessel output is regressed on a linear function of vessel inputs and a random composed error. Using parametric assumptions on the regression residual, estimates of vessel technical efficiency are calculated as the mean of a truncated normal distribution and are often reported in a rank statistic {{as a measure of}} a captain's skill and used to estimate excess capacity within fisheries. We demonstrate analytically that these measures are potentially flawed, and extend the results of Horrace (2005) to estimate captain skill for thirty-nine vessels in the Northeast Atlantic <b>herring</b> <b>fleet,</b> based on homogeneous and heterogeneous production functions within the fleet. When homogeneous production is assumed, we find inferential inconsistencies between our methods and the methods of ranking the means of the technical inefficiency distributions for each vessel.
