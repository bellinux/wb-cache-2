House simply describes Stacy as [...] "very convincing", as Mark thinks {{there is nothing wrong with}} him, but <b>House</b> <b>says</b> that if Stacy says that Mark is ill, he is ill.

500|$|The {{organization}} Freedom House {{commented on}} {{the adoption of the}} anthem in a report about the country, published in 2003. On page 125 of the [...] "Country Report of Belarus", Freedom <b>House</b> <b>says</b> that President Lukashenko has [...] "reintroduced the state symbols used by the old Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. In 2002, the president approved a streamlined version of the Soviet-era anthem [...] "My Belarusy" [...] ("We Belarusians"), as the country's new national anthem." [...] The report also mentioned President Lukashenko's ban of the symbols that were used since Belarus's independence in 1991, such as the Pahonia arms and the white, red, white flag, which Lukashenko claims are associated with fascism (because the pro-Nazi Belarusian Central Rada in World War II used these symbols). In 2003, Dr. Taras Kuzio wrote in Radio Free Europe that President Lukashenko [...] "is the quintessential Soviet Belarusian patriot who presides over a regime steeped in Soviet nostalgia." [...] Kuzio said that the motives of Russia and Belarus in re-adopting Soviet-era symbols are part of restoring that nostalgia.|$|E
