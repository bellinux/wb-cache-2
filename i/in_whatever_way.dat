She even retakes her mantle of Batgirl, with help from Lex Luthor, who uses a machine to heal her paralysis. During the fight against the Regime, she loses her father, Jim Gordon, when he sacrifices himself in order to weaken the Regime enforcers. She is presumably killed by Superman at the end of Year Five when she was helping Batwoman get to the alternate universe in order to get help from the alternate Justice League. This occurred, because Catwoman betrayed the Insurgency to save Batman's life.|$|E

Yoga is a Hindu discipline which trains the body, mind and consciousness for health, tranquility and spiritual insight.

Texts dedicated to Yoga include the Yoga Sutras, the Hatha Yoga Pradipika, the Bhagavad Gita and, as their philosophical and historical basis, the Upanishads. Yoga is means, and the four major marga (paths) discussed in Hinduism are: Bhakti Yoga (the path of love and devotion), Karma Yoga (the path of right action), Rāja Yoga (the path of meditation), Jñāna Yoga (the path of wisdom) An individual may prefer one or some yogas over others, according to his or her inclination and understanding.

[...] After the animation, artists duplicated the beads onto the animated geometry for a pre-simulated lighting version to get approval on how the object would read. Sims were then run [...] "on all the targets which would be discrete beads floating around on top of the surface which would have its own set of parameters," [...] said Goodwin. [...] "The bead size or the turbulence that would crawl along the surface constantly updating the orientation was based on the normal provided by the surface. That was then saved to disk and we would use that sim as the final target for the simulation." [...] After the simulation process, Weta Digital ran every bead through a temporal filter to remove jitter to control the noise. Lighting solutions directly worked on the set.

500|$|The {{episode was}} first {{announced}} at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International on July 25, 2009, by series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane. It was written by fellow executive producer and series regular Danny Smith and directed by Joseph Lee, during the show's eighth production season. The storyline was pitched by series regular Tom Devanney, and periodically references Billions and Billions (1997), a book of essays by Carl Sagan. [...] Seth MacFarlane asked Danny Smith to read Sagan's essay, [...] "Abortion: Is It Possible to Be Both 'Pro-Life' and 'Pro-Choice'", before beginning to write the script. The episode was originally intended to air {{along with the rest}} of the eighth season schedule, and was approved for production by 20th Century Fox. However, the Fox Broadcasting Company asserted their right not to air the episode due to the subject matter. This was the second time that MacFarlane had been warned by Fox about the sensitive nature of an episode's subject. Previously, the network had also disapproved of the season 3 episode [...] "When You Wish Upon a Weinstein", which was originally prevented from airing on Fox, but finally aired on Adult Swim, and eventually on Fox more than four years after it was rejected. Thinking the same would happen with [...] "Partial Terms of Endearment", MacFarlane believed that Fox would eventually run the episode on their network, stating, [...] "Most of the time these things turn out to be nothing."

500|$|To {{promote his}} {{developing}} ideas for an expedition that would overwinter on the Antarctic continent at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink hurried to London, where the Royal Geographical Society was hosting the Sixth International Geographical Congress. On 1 August 1895 {{he addressed the}} conference, giving {{an account of the}} Cape Adare foreshore as a location where a scientific expedition might establish itself for the Antarctic winter. He described the site as [...] "a safe situation for houses, tents and provisions", and said there were indications that in this place [...] "the unbound forces of the Antarctic Circle do not display the full severity of their powers". He also suggested that the interior of the continent might be accessible from the foreshore by an easy route—a [...] "gentle slope". He ended his speech by declaring his willingness to lead an expedition there himself. Hugh Robert Mill, the Royal Geographical Society's librarian, who was present at the Congress, reported reactions to the speech: [...] "His blunt manner and abrupt speech stirred the academic discussions with a fresh breeze of realism. Nobody liked Borchgrevink very much at that time, but he had a dynamic quality and a set purpose to get out again to the unknown South that struck some of us as boding well for exploration". The Congress did not, however, endorse Borchgrevink's ideas. Instead, it passed a general resolution in support of Antarctic exploration, to the effect that [...] "the various scientific societies throughout the world should urge, <b>in</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>way</b> seems to them most effective, that this work be undertaken before the close of the century".|$|E
500|$|Some further {{procedural}} {{reforms were}} {{undertaken in the}} 1850s. In 1850, {{a new set of}} Chancery orders were produced by the Lord Chancellor, allowing Masters to speed up cases <b>in</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>way</b> they chose and allowing plaintiffs to file a claim, rather than the more expensive and long-winded bill of complaint. The Suitors in Chancery Relief Act 1852 gave all court officials salaries, abolished the need to pay them fees and made it illegal for them to receive gratuities; it also removed more sinecure positions. The Master in Chancery Abolition Act 1852 abolished the Masters in Chancery, allowing all cases to be heard directly by judges instead of bounced back-and-forth between judges and Masters. As a result of these reforms the court became far more efficient, and the backlog decreased; in the 1860s an average of 3,207 cases were submitted each year, while the Court heard and dismissed 3,833, many of them from the previous backlog. Much of this work was carried out by the growing number of clerks, however, and members of the legal profession became concerned about the [...] "famine" [...] of equity judges. Despite these reforms, it was still possible for Charles Dickens, writing in 1853 in the preface to his novel Bleak House, to bemoan the inefficiencies of the Court of Chancery. His novel revolves around a fictional long-running Chancery case, Jarndyce and Jarndyce. He observed that {{at the time he was}} writing there was a case before the Chancery court [...] "which was commenced nearly twenty years ago... and which is (I am assured) no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun". He concluded that [...] "If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce, I could rain them on these pages, to the shame of a parsimonious public".|$|E
