30|$|Considering my {{subjective}} {{experience as}} a researcher (Hamilton et al. 2008), <b>I</b> have <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> this course next year by asking students to draw a concept map of SPs, thus their prior knowledge of SPs, and then {{to go ahead with}} the three sessions discussed here. During the lecture and microteaching hours, I will deeply discuss the concepts of experiment, observation, inference, and prediction in order to avoid any kind of misconception. After the first microteaching experiences, I will ask my students to reflect on their understanding of SPs in addition to their reports on LPs. Following their LPs, I will ask carefully constructed questions in order to hone the pre-service teachers’ ability to ask high-quality questions that will help their students to engage in scientific tasks, just like scientists investigating the natural world. Then I will discuss disciplinary core ideas to increase students’ understandings of domain specificity. Finally, I will focus on communicating information about social certification in science. Following the lectures, I will ask my students to focus on the quality of their questions, the core disciplinary concepts taught in their LPs, the ways in which their students will communicate information, and relevant ethical issues. After the second microteaching experiences, I will ask them to reflect on their understanding of the issues discussed during lecture hours. At the end of the course, I will ask them to draw another concept map of SPs to illustrate their newly acquired understanding of SPs and of science in general. This design for next year’s course may help me to overcome the limitations of this study and lead me to a broader understanding of my students’ ways of thinking about science.|$|R
40|$|Master of Public HealthPublic Health Interdepartmental ProgramDerek A. MosierProject Overview This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{due to an}} interest in volunteering with Fort Riley Public Health. Being an army spouse, I was curious how Army Public Health supports our unique and constantly changing community. LTC Paul Benne, chief of Fort Riley Public Health, expressed an interest for an MPH graduate student to address obesity of active duty military personnel and their beneficiaries {{from the standpoint of}} improving nutrition on post. This objective was initially given to LTC Benne from the Irwin Army Community Hospital commander COL Michael Heimall who would allocate any necessary funding for initiatives or staff. The following objectives evolved as the study progressed. Objectives: 1. Conduct a literature review to determine an age demographic of the US population where obesity prevention/ intervention efforts should start. 2. Conduct descriptive epidemiology on Fort Riley, US Army post, to determine what nutrition initiatives are already in place and which areas have opportunities for improvement. 3. Develop, conduct and statistically analyze a survey on nutrition education and school cafeteria behaviors and use the results to make recommendations to invested partners. 4. Start the intervention. Background Initial literature reviews focused on 1) Whether childhood or adulthood was the most effective time <b>to</b> <b>start</b> nutrition interventions and 2) At what age obesity/overweight first becomes a problem in those at risk. I visited a variety of on-post establishments that serve/sell food {{that may or may not}} contribute to obesity. These visits included military dining facilities, commercial dining facilities (Burger King, Dominoes, etc), child development centers (infants- 5 year olds), school cafeterias, and the commissary (grocery store). Upon visiting these sites and conducting the literature reviews, I designed 3 courses of action to address obesity/nutrition focusing specifically on elementary schools, military dining facilities, and commercial dining facilities. These were presented to COL Heimall and the deputy commander for health services at the hospital, COL Reynold Mosier. They determined that all recommendations had value and that each should be pursued. Additionally, they wanted to expand elementary school nutrition initiatives to all of USD 383 and 475 school districts instead of schools specifically on post. LTC Benne and <b>I</b> therefore <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> with the elementary schools because the literature reviews identified childhood as a time to focus interventions for proper nutrition and obesity prevention. Other courses of action will be pursued by future MPH interns as phases of a nutrition promotion initiative on post...|$|R

40|$|There {{are over}} 324, 697, 205 [4] {{websites}} {{on the internet}} as of May 2011. What I’m aiming to create, conjointly with European Business Partners HB, is not just yet any other website or electronic service. Indeed, {{the goal is to}} create an international space where users from across many countries can advertise a property or search for one in the nicest and easiest way possible. By making the website international, the average customer wouldn’t have to try and look for the real estate website local to every country. Take for example the case of an American student wanting to go to France for studies. Normally he’d try Google to search for a website that advertises French apartments. The search word he types would usually be in English. However a good local website will most likely be in the country’s language, which in this case is French. And so, the student in our example would have difficulties progressing with his travel. Consequently, the project’s purpose is to provide a solution to this type of problem and many others. In this report, then, I will be discussing some of these issues related to the world of real estate advertisement, some improvements I thought of, and the results I have achieved. Some of the results that illustrate a solution to the aforementioned problem would be to add a translation tool to the website. So that even if a property’s description is written in a different language, it would require little effort to translate. Also, the general solution I am proposing is to aggregate all ads of every country inside one website. And to do that, two main steps are necessary: First: Build an attractive website that offers as many facilities and innovative features to the user as possible. Second: Market the website, and publicize it. To achieve the second step, the company and <b>I</b> <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> first <b>start</b> by marketing the website in one country at a time. First, we’d start by a general English website, which would serve as our template website. Then this latter one will be translated into Swedish, and it will be marketed in Sweden. Indeed, the approach is to market it in one country at a time, until it gains strong popularity. And for each of these countries, the website will provide geographical, language, and technical support. Overall, throughout this report, I will provide more in-depth explanation of the problem at hand, a thorough investigation of possible solutions, and finally the results achieved, with examples of the implemented website. I will also discuss at the end all future work still underway...|$|R
40|$|When Su Cleyle and <b>I</b> first <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> Evidence Based Library and Information Practice, one of {{the things}} we agreed upon {{immediately}} was that the journal be open access. We knew that a major obstacle to librarians using the research literature was that they did not have access to the research literature. Although Su and I are both academic librarians who can access a wide variety of library and information literature from our institutions, we belong to a profession where not everyone has equal access to the research in our field. Without such access to our own body of literature, how can we ever hope for practitioners to use research evidence in their decision making? It would have been contradictory to the principles of evidence based library and information practice to do otherwise. One of the specific groups we thought could use such an open access venue for discovering research literature was school librarians. School librarians are often isolated and lacking access to the research literature that may help them prove to stakeholders the importance of their libraries and their role within schools. Certainly, school libraries have been in decline and the use of evidence to show value is needed. As Ken Haycock noted in his 2003 report, The Crisis in Canada’s School Libraries: The Case for Reform and Reinvestment, “Across the country, teacher-librarians are losing their jobs or being reassigned. Collections are becoming depleted owing to budget cuts. Some principals believe that in the age of the Internet and the classroom workstation, the school library is an artifact” (9). Within this context, school librarians are looking to our research literature for evidence of the impact that school library programs have on learning outcomes and student success. They are integrating that evidence into their practice, and reflecting upon what can be improved locally. They are focusing on students and showing the impact of school libraries and librarians on student achievement. Todd notes, “If we do not show value, we will not have a future. Evidence-based practice is not about the survival of school librarians, it’s about the survival of our students” (40). In this issue we feature school libraries and their connection to evidence based practice. Former Editor-in-Chief, Lindsay Glynn, began putting the wheels in motion for this feature almost a year ago. She invited Carol Gordon and Ross Todd to act as guest editors of the section, drawing upon their contacts and previous work in this field. The result is an issue with five feature articles exploring different aspects of the connection between school libraries and evidence based practice, from the theoretical to the practical. In addition, there is a thought-provoking Commentary by David Loertscher, asking whether we need the evolutionary model of evidence based practice, or something more revolutionary!In addition to the Feature section, we have a well-rounded issue with articles on the topics of library human resources, and the development of a scholars’ portal. As well, there are a record 10 evidence summaries and our educational EBL 101 column. I hope there is something for everyone in this issue of EBLIP – enjoy, and see you soon in Stockholm...|$|R

When Jobs was 23 (the same age as his biological parents when they had him) Brennan gave birth to her baby, Lisa Brennan, on May 17, 1978. [...] "Dear Mike, This morning's papers carried suggestions that Apple is considering removing me as chairman. I don't know the source of these reports, but they are both misleading to the public and unfair to me. You will recall that at last Thursday's Board meeting I stated <b>I</b> had <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>start</b> a new venture, and I tendered my resignation as chairman. The Board declined to accept my resignation and asked me to defer it for a week. I agreed to do so in light of the encouragement the Board offered with regard to the proposed new venture and the indications that Apple would invest in it. On Friday, after I told John Sculley who would be joining me, he confirmed Apple's willingness to discuss areas of possible collaboration between Apple and my new venture. Subsequently the Company appears to be adopting a hostile posture toward me and the new venture. Accordingly, I must insist upon the immediate acceptance of my resignation. I would hope that in any statement it feels it must issue, the Company will make it clear that the decision to resign as chairman was mine. I find myself both saddened and perplexed by the management's conduct in this matter which seems to me contrary to Apple's best interests. Those interests remain a matter of deep concern to me, both because of my past association with Apple and the substantial investment I retain in it. I continue to hope that calmer voices within the Company may yet be heard. Some Company representatives have said they fear I will use proprietary Apple technology in my new venture. There is no basis for any such concern. If that concern is the real source of Apple's hostility to the venture, I can allay it. As you know, the company's recent re-organization left me with no work to do and no access even to regular management reports. I am but 30 and want still to contribute and achieve. After what we have accomplished together, I would wish our parting to be both amicable and dignified. Yours sincerely, Steven P. Jobs."
