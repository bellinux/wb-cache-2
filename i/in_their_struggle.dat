5|$|The United States' {{declaration}} of independence from Great Britain in 1776 led criollos (Spanish peoples born in the Americas) to believe that revolution and independence from Spain were feasible. Between 1775 and 1783, the American patriots of the Thirteen Colonies waged the American Revolutionary War against both the local loyalists and the Kingdom of Great Britain, eventually establishing a popular government {{in the place of}} the British monarchy. The fact that Spain aided the colonies <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>struggle</b> against Britain weakened the idea {{that it would be a}} crime to end one's allegiance to the parent state.|$|E

The Serbian Bar Association unanimously supported the Appeal. The Aćimović administration also appealed for rebels {{to return to their homes}} and announced bounties for the killing of rebels and their leaders. Aćimović also gave orders that the wives of communists and their sons older than 16 years of age be arrested and held, and the Germans burned their houses and imposed curfews.|$|E
