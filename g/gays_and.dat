40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the intersections of <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> bisexual identity with body size, or fatness. <b>Gay</b> <b>and</b> bisexual identity and fatness are marginalized social identities {{that seem to}} be incompatible (Bond, 2013). While a sense of collective identity with the <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> bisexual community {{has been shown to be}} a protective factor against internalized homonegativity in <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> bisexual men (Halpin & Allen, 2004), the degree to which this protective factor persists for fat people in an anti-fat environment like the <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> bisexual community (Wrench & Knapp, 2008) has not been explored. This intersection of identities and anti-fat culture seemed to suggest there might be a relationship between fatness and internalized homophobia. Fatness did not moderate the relationship between sense of belonging to the <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> bisexual community and internalized homonegativity, but a significant positive relationship was found between belongingness to the <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> bisexual community and body shame...|$|R

5|$|After the elation {{of change}} {{following}} group {{action in the}} 1969 Stonewall riots in New York City, in the late 1970s and the early 1980s, some <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> lesbians became less accepting of bisexual or transgender people. Critics said that transgender people were acting out stereotypes and bisexuals were simply gay men or lesbian women who were afraid {{to come out and}} be honest about their identity. Each community has struggled to develop its own identity including whether, and how, to align with other gender and sexuality-based communities, at times excluding other subgroups; these conflicts continue to this day. LGBTQ activists and artists have created posters to raise consciousness about the issue since the movement began.|$|E
5|$|Gittings {{admitted}} that early meetings and writings in the Daughters of Bilitis urged their members not to upset mainstream heterosexual society; that integration and acceptance would be won if heterosexuals {{could see that}} <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> lesbians were not dramatically different from themselves. She worked in clerical positions during this time, spending ten years as a mimeograph operator for an architectural firm. The New York chapter of the DOB distributed a newsletter to about 150 people, and Gittings worked on it while being required to stay overtime at her job. In 1959, after using company envelopes to mail the newsletter out and covering the firm's name with a sticker, someone wrote to the firm to notify them that a newsletter addressing lesbianism was being distributed. Gittings was sure {{that she would be}} fired, but her boss, a woman, stated cryptically that she was familiar with the topic, having served in the armed forces. She was not fired but cautioned to be more careful instead.|$|E
40|$|In Norway, a {{gender-neutral}} Marriage Law that secured equal {{marriage and}} parenting rights for lesbian, <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> heterosexual couples took effect in January 2009. The {{aim of the}} current study was to explore Norwegian beliefs about equal marriage and parenting rights for lesbian, <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> heterosexual couples and the welfare of children with lesbian <b>and</b> <b>gay</b> parents. A sample of 1, 246 Norwegians participated in the study by filling out a questionnaire. The majority reported that they were supportive of equal marriage rights for lesbian, <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> heterosexual couples, whilst there was less support for granting <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian couples equal right to become parents. The negative attitudes towards equal parenting rights for lesbian, <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> heterosexual couples were explained mainly by concerns about the welfare of children growing up with <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parents...|$|R

40|$|As {{the number}} of {{same-sex}} parents creating families and raising children rises, the stigma surrounding parent-child sex communication (PCSC) remains constant. Parents serve {{as one of the}} primary sources of information regarding sex and sexuality to their children; however, <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parent-child sex communication remains largely unstudied. Framed within grounded theory, the primary goal {{of this study is to}} investigate how <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parents navigate and enact parent-child sex communication with their children. Through 22 in-depth interviews with <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parents who have directly communicated about sex and sexuality with their children, the following four research questions were addressed: 1) How do same-sex parents understand and enact PCSC? 2) What topics and discourses are inherent within <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parent PCSC? 3) How, if at all, do <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parents discuss sexual orientation during PCSC? 4) How, if at all, do <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parents converse with each other in preparation for PCSC? Participants discussed their experiences engaging in and enacting PCSC with their children providing a unique standpoint in <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian specific PCSC. Discussion of the findings are discussed in relation to the similarities of <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian specific PCSC and extant literature regarding heterosexual parent PCSC, the unique experiences of <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parents during PCSC, <b>and</b> finally how <b>gay</b> <b>and</b> lesbian parent PCSC can further inform all PCSC research. Directions for future research are also addressed. ...|$|R
5|$|Despite DOMA, Clinton was {{the first}} {{president}} to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for <b>gays</b> <b>and</b> {{for the private sector}} Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.|$|E
