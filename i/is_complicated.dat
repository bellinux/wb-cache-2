5|$|The {{life cycle}} of poxviruses <b>is</b> <b>complicated</b> by having {{multiple}} infectious forms, with differing mechanisms of cell entry. Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses in that they replicate in the cytoplasm of the cell {{rather than in the}} nucleus. In order to replicate, poxviruses produce a variety of specialized proteins not produced by other DNA viruses, the most important of which is a viral-associated DNA-dependent RNA polymerase.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} in multi-wall CNTs <b>is</b> <b>complicated</b> as their properties {{are determined by}} contribution of all individual shells; those shells have different structures, and, because of the synthesis, are usually more defective than SWCNTs.

5|$|This {{problem was}} first {{addressed}} by C.R. Illingworth in 1950. In incompressible flow, the velocity profile is linear because the fluid temperature is constant.

5|$|Although {{there are}} {{numerous}} statements that could have borne the name Ramanujan conjecture, there is one that was highly influential on later work. In particular, the connection of this conjecture with conjectures of André Weil in algebraic geometry opened up new areas of research. That Ramanujan conjecture is an assertion {{on the size of}} the tau-function, which has as generating function the discriminant modular form Δ(q), a typical cusp form in the theory of modular forms. It was finally proven in 1973, as a consequence of Pierre Deligne's proof of the Weil conjectures. The reduction step involved <b>is</b> <b>complicated.</b> Deligne won a Fields Medal in 1978 for that work.|$|E
5|$|Antimotility {{medication}} has {{a theoretical}} risk of causing complications, and although clinical experience has shown {{this to be}} unlikely, these drugs are discouraged in people with bloody diarrhea or diarrhea that <b>is</b> <b>complicated</b> by fever. Loperamide, an opioid analogue, is commonly used for the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. Loperamide is not recommended in children, however, as it may cross the immature blood–brain barrier and cause toxicity. Bismuth subsalicylate, an insoluble complex of trivalent bismuth and salicylate, {{can be used in}} mild to moderate cases, but salicylate toxicity is theoretically possible.|$|E

5|$|Central Atlas Tamazight {{is one of}} {{the four}} most-spoken Berber languages, in {{addition}} to Kabyle, Shilha, and Riff, and rivals Shilha as the most-spoken Berber language in Morocco. Differentiating these dialects <b>is</b> <b>complicated</b> by the fact that speakers of other languages may also refer to their language as 'Tamazight'. The differences between all three groups are largely phonological and lexical, rather than syntactic. Tamazight itself has a relatively large degree of internal diversity, including whether spirantization occurs.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{the total}} {{civilian}} population of Nanking in December 1937 {{and the size}} of the Chinese garrison defending the city are used as a basis for calculating the death toll, though the matter <b>is</b> <b>complicated</b> due to greatly varying estimates for both of these numbers. For instance, Tokushi Kasahara claims that Nanking's population in 1937 included 400,000 to 500,000 civilians and 150,000 soldiers, whereas David Askew believes it was 200,000 to 250,000 civilians and 73,790 to 81,500 soldiers.|$|E

Case presentation A 7 -year-old Caucasian girl presented to our hospital in March 2008 with a three day history of upper respiratory infection. Her condition worsened and she was placed on ventilator support for two weeks. Her recovery <b>was</b> <b>complicated</b> by a persistent selective parasympathetic dysautonomia. Her past medical history was unremarkable.

None have been shown to reliably differentiate between AS and other ASDs.|$|E
5|$|The massive {{amount of}} {{exponentially}} growing sequence data is a daunting challenge that <b>is</b> <b>complicated</b> by {{the complexity of the}} metadata associated with metagenomic projects. Metadata includes detailed information about the three-dimensional (including depth, or height) geography and environmental features of the sample, physical data about the sample site, and the methodology of the sampling. This information is necessary both to ensure replicability and to enable downstream analysis. Because of its importance, metadata and collaborative data review and curation require standardized data formats located in specialized databases, such as the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD).|$|E
5|$|The rails are a bird family {{comprising}} nearly 150 species. Although {{origins of}} the group are lost in antiquity, {{the largest number of}} species and least specialised forms are found in the Old World, suggesting this family originated there. The taxonomy of the small crakes <b>is</b> <b>complicated,</b> but the closest relative of the corn crake is the African crake, C. egregia, which has sometimes been given its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex. Both species are short-billed brown birds with a preference for grassland rather than wetland habitats typical of rails. Porzana crakes, particularly the ash-throated crake (Porzana albicollis) are near relatives of the Crex genus.|$|E

5|$|The {{taxonomy}} {{of the small}} crakes <b>is</b> <b>complicated,</b> but the closest relative of the corn crake is the African crake, C. egregia. This was first described as Ortygometra egregria by Wilhelm Peters in 1854 from a specimen obtained in Mozambique, and has variously been placed in the genus Porzana or its own genus, Crecopsis, but is now more usually placed in Crex. The Porzana crakes are the closest relatives of the Crex genus, particularly the ash-throated crake, Porzana albicollis, which has occasionally also been allocated to Crex.|$|E
5|$|Writer/artist Alison Bechdel's book Fun Home, {{a memoir}} in comics format, was {{published}} in 2006 to critical acclaim.

Four months after Alison comes out to her parents, Bruce is killed by an oncoming truck; although the evidence is equivocal, Alison concludes that he committed suicide.|$|E
