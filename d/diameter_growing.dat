40|$|Two new {{classes of}} {{networks}} are introduced that resemble small-world properties. These networks are recursively constructed but retain a fixed, regular degree. They {{consist of a}} one-dimensional lattice backbone overlayed by a hierarchical sequence of long-distance links. Both types of networks, one 3 -regular and the other 4 -regular, lead to distinct behaviors, as revealed by renormalization group studies. The 3 -regular networks are planar, have a <b>diameter</b> <b>growing</b> as \sqrt{N} with the system size N, and lead to super-diffusion with an exact, anomalous exponent d_w= 1. 3057581 [...] ., but possesses only a trivial fixed point T_c= 0 for the Ising ferromagnet. In turn, the 4 -regular networks are non-planar, have a <b>diameter</b> <b>growing</b> as ~ 2 ^[\sqrt(\log_ 2 N^ 2) ], exhibit "ballistic" diffusion (d_w= 1), and a non-trivial ferromagnetic transition, T_c> 0.

An Aplin and Hill plot (r 2 – r 1 against ln r 2 – ln r 1) of the data and regression analyses suggested an initial phase of growth (up to a diameter of about 7 mm) in which the relative growth rate increased rapidly. This {{was followed by a}} phase in which the relative growth rate fell but the radial growth rate continued to rise (7 to 20 mm in diameter). Radial growth was then relatively constant until about 45 mm diameter and then declined. The Aplin and Hill model did not fit the data as a whole but may apply for a transient period in thalli between about 7 and 16 mm in diameter.

We use renormalization group arguments {{to show that}} HN 3, a 3 -regular planar graph, has a <b>diameter</b> <b>growing</b> as √(N) with the system size, and random walks on HN 3 exhibit super-diffusion with an anomalous exponent d_w = 2 - _ 2 ϕ = 1. 306 [...] ., where ϕ = (√(5) + 1) / 2 = 1. 618 [...] . is the "golden ratio. " In contrast, HN 4, a non-planar 4 -regular graph, has a diameter that grows slower than any power of N, yet, fast than any power of N. In an annealed approximation we can show that diffusive transport on HN 4 occurs ballistically (d_w = 1). Walkers on both graphs possess a first- return probability with a power law tail characterized by an exponent μ = 2 - 1 /d_w. It is shown explicitly that recurrence properties on HN 3 depend on the starting site. Comment: 15 pages, revtex; published version; find related material at [URL]...|$|E

40|$|In [Math. Meth. Appl. Sci. 19 (1996) 53 - 62], C. Marchioro {{examined}} {{the problem of}} vorticity confinement in the exterior of a smooth bounded domain. The main result in Marchioro's paper is that solutions of the incompressible 2 D Euler equations with compactly supported nonnegative initial vorticity in the exterior of a connected bounded region have vorticity support with <b>diameter</b> <b>growing</b> at most like O(t^(1 / 2) +), for any > 0. In addition, if the domain is the exterior of a disk, then the vorticity support is contained in a disk of radius O(t^ 1 / 3). The {{purpose of the present}} article is to refine Marchioro's results. We will prove that, if the initial vorticity is even with respect to the origin, then the exponent for the exterior of the disk may be improved to 1 / 4. For flows in the exterior of a smooth, connected, bounded domain we prove a confinement estimate with exponent 1 / 2 (i. e. we remove the) and in certain cases, depending on the harmonic part of the flow, we establish a logarithmic improvement over the exponent 1 / 2. The main new ingredients in our approach are: (1) a detailed asymptotic description of solutions to the exterior Poisson problem near infinity, obtained by the use of Riemann mappings; (2) renormalized energy estimates and bounds on logarithmic moments of vorticity and (3) a new a priori estimate on time derivatives of logarithmic perturbations of the moment of inertia.

40|$|Stimulating {{angiogenesis}} by {{gene transfer}} approaches offers {{the hope of}} treating tissue ischemia which is untreatable by currently practiced techniques of vessel grafting and bypass surgery. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and {{basic fibroblast growth factor}} (FGF- 2) are potent angiogenic molecules, making them ideal candidates for novel gene transfer protocols designed to promote new blood vessel growth. In this study, an ex vivo gene therapy approach utilizing cell encapsulation was employed to deliver VEGF and FGF- 2 in a continuous and localized manner. C(2) C(12) myoblasts were genetically engineered to secrete VEGF(121), VEGF(165) and FGF- 2. These cell lines were encapsulated in hollow microporous polymer membranes for transplantation in vivo. Therapeutic efficacy was evaluated in a model of acute skin flap ischemia. Capsules were positioned under the distal, ischemic region of the flap. Control flaps showed 50 % necrosis at 1 week. Capsules releasing either form of VEGF had no effect on flap survival, but induced a modest increase in distal vascular supply. Delivery of FGF- 2 significantly improved flap survival, reducing necrosis to 34. 2 % (P < 0. 001). Flap vascularization was significantly increased by FGF- 2 (P < 0. 01), with numerous vessels, many of which had a large lumen <b>diameter,</b> <b>growing</b> in the proximity of the implanted capsules. These results demonstrate that FGF- 2, delivered from encapsulated cells, is more efficacious than either VEGF(121) or VEGF(165) in treating acute skin ischemia and improving skin flap survival. Furthermore, these data attest to the applicability of cell encapsulation for the delivery of angiogenic factors for the treatment and prevention of tissue ischemia...|$|E
