Coils designed for the human head need significant redesigning to stimulate selective regions of the mouse brain for advanced TMS therapy analysis. We report a focused and deep brain TMS coil for mice {{that is based on}} a two coil configuration similar to the 2 ̆ 7 Halo coil 2 ̆ 7. A heterogeneous MRI derived head model of mouse was used to obtain an electric field of about 150 V/m in selective deeper regions of the brain.

Relationship between hardness and <b>half</b> <b>value</b> broad of X-ray and structure of ground surface were discussed. Furthermore, the residual stress and hardness depended on the depth from ground surface were measured.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} the kilovoltage X-ray energy spectrum on the ID 17 beamline at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF). The purpose of such validation was to provide an accurate energy spectrum as the input to a computerized treatment planning system, which will be used in synchrotron microbeam radiotherapy trials at the ESRF. Calculated and measured energy spectra on ID 17 have been reported previously but recent additions and safety modifications to the beamline for veterinary trials warranted a fresh investigation. The authors used an established methodology to compare X-ray attenuation measurements in copper sheets (referred to as <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layer measurements in the radiotherapy field) with the predictions of a theoretical model. A cylindrical ionization chamber in air was used to record the relative attenuation of the X-ray beam intensity by increasing thicknesses of high-purity copper sheets. The authors measured the <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layers in copper for two beamline configurations, which corresponded to differing spectral conditions. The authors obtained good agreement between the measured and predicted <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layers for the two beamline configurations. The measured first <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layer was 1. 754 +/- 0. 035 mm Cu and 1. 962 +/- 0. 039 mm Cu for the two spectral conditions, compared with theoretical predictions of 1. 763 +/- 0. 039 mm Cu and 1. 984 +/- 0. 044 mm Cu, respectively. The calculated mean energies for the two conditions were 105 keV and 110 keVand there was not a substantial difference in the calculated percentage depth dose curves in water between the different spectral conditions. The authors observed a difference between their calculated energy spectra and the spectra previously reported by other authors, particularly at energies greater than 100 keV. The validation of the beam spectrum by the copper <b>half</b> <b>value</b> layer measurements means the authors can provide an accurate spectrum as an input to a treatment planning system for the forthcoming veterinary trials of microbeam radiotherapy to spontaneous tumours in cats and dogs...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — It is {{important}} for diagnosis of glaucoma to grasp 3 -D structure of an optic nerve head (ONH). The quantitative 3 -D reconstruction of the ONH {{is required for the}} diagnosis. We propose a technique to obtain the <b>depth</b> <b>value</b> from stereo image pair of a retinal fundus for the 3 -D reconstruction of the ONH. Our technique mainly consists of four steps: (1) cutout of the ONH region from the fundus images, (2) registration of the stereo pair, (3) disparity detection, and (4) depth calculation. For quantitative estimation of the <b>depth</b> <b>value</b> measured by using this method, the <b>depth</b> <b>value</b> was compared with the measurement results determined from the Heidelberg Retina Tomograph (HRT), which is a confocal laser-scanning microscope.

The calibrator generates lightning impulses (LI) with known peak value (UP), front time (T 1), and time to <b>half</b> <b>value</b> (T 2); or switching impulses (SI) with known peak value (UP), time to peak (TP), and time to <b>half</b> <b>value</b> (T 2). The peak voltages of the constructed devices range from 50  mV to 1000  V. The calibration of impulse voltage measuring equipment is required both by high voltage and quality standards, and the gap between the best measurement accuracy available at National Metrology Institutes; the accuracy that is required in high voltage testing has been very narrow. The only way to improve the situation is to lower the measurement uncertainty levels in the National Metrology Institutes. In this work, the traceability of the peak and time parameter values is based on the modelling of the circuit, and the calculation of these parameters according to network theory. This calculation is based on the calibrated component (resistor and capacitor) values of the impulse circuit. The uncertainty in the peak values is low, as the peak value is not sensitive to changes in the component values of the circuit. The estimated uncertainties for lightning impulse calibrators are 0, 05 % for peak value, 0, 5 % for front time, and 0, 3 % for time to <b>half</b> <b>value.</b> For switching impulses the corresponding uncertainties are 0, 1 %, 0, 4 % and 0, 3 %.
