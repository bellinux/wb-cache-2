40|$|<b>Database</b> <b>protection</b> is {{traditionally}} the prerogative of copyright. Copyright aims at fostering creativity by the grant of exclusive rights {{for a limited}} term for authors of literary, artistic or musical works. Compilations or databases are species of literary work; which are protectable by copyright if the requisite minimum-originality threshold is satisfied. The originality criterion is designed to sift ideas, facts and other public-domain materials from the creative expression of such ideas or facts. The idea/expression dichotomy is central to copyright philosophy. However, determining what elements of databases {{should be considered in}} applying the weight of the originality criterion is as problematic as it is controversial. In the United States, the originality criterion is applied very strictly, and copyright was denied to white pages of telephone directories in which subscribersâ€™ names and addresses were arranged in the traditional alphabetical order. â€™ However, in the United Kingdom and Australia, courts lean more in favour of protecting the labour involved in the selection, arrangement or collation of the contents of databases. This is known as â€œsweat-of-the-browâ€™â€™ <b>database</b> <b>protection.</b> Critics rail against sweat of the brow as capable of short-changing the copyright ideal, and as being no more than an intrusion on public domain. The European Union came up with an answer {{in the form of the}} stli genetis EC Database Directive. 2 It is designed to protect investments in commercial databases as a means of encouraging more investments in database ventures. An attempt to internationahze the Database Directive through the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) &d not catch on in 1996. The international apathy towards the stligeneris regrme is due to many reasons, ranging &om alternative forms of protection such as unh- competition and technological measures, i. e. encryption, to protests fi-om the civil society which perceives the sui gmeris regime as an enclosure of the common or the public domain. This article examines what form of protection developing countries might wish to adopt. There are a variety of options, ranging from copyright and unfair competition legislation to industry control through technology, such as encryption. Nigeriaâ€™s copyright law is examined as a model. It has a strict approach that is akin to that of the United States in the application of the originality criterion to databases. The article has seven Sections. Section I contains the introduction, and dscusses the general notion of copyright. It also examines the criteria for copyright and copyright protection under international law.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, {{one of the}} most {{contentious}} issues in intellectual property has been the question of statutory <b>protection</b> for <b>databases</b> and compilations. A number of factors had converged during the 1990 ’s to place this issue on the policy agenda, including court decisions holding that the factual elements within collections of information are not necessarily covered by copyright laws, 1 the adoption within the European Union of a Directive on the subject, 2 and the continued advances in informational technologies that have made database collections increasingly vulnerable to misappropriation. 3 The efforts of proponents of new, or sui generis <b>database</b> <b>protections</b> to enact new legislation in the United States had been unsuccessful in the 104 th, 105 th, 106 th and 108 th Congresses, 4 and an effort to bring <b>database</b> <b>protections</b> within the ambit of the World Intellectual Property Organization’s (WIPO) system of treaties failed to gain approval at its 1996 diplomatic conference. The continuing efforts of the European Union to place the issue of a new database treaty at the fore of the WIPO agenda through its Standing Committee on Copyright and Related Rights, has been unsuccessful in the face of growing resistance from developing countries. 5 In the United States, various efforts to mediate the disparate position of the various stakeholders have been largely unsuccessful. 6 This paper presents the drive towards sui generis legislation for databases as a case study that exemplifies the expansionary nature of the contemporary intellectual property policy environment. Section I places the problem in context by discussing the strategic importance of databases for the contemporary research enterprise. Focusing on what databases are, how they are used by researchers, how they are becoming increasingly central to the process of scientific research, and how sui generis legislation would disrupt these processes helps frame the subsequent discussion of particular legislative proposals. Section II outlines and evaluates the three primary justifications advanced by proponents of sui generis database legislation; the need to fill in a perceived gap caused by lack of adequate protection under U. S. copyright law, the need to harmonize U. S. law with the European Union Database Directive, and the increased risks of misappropriation brought about by technological advances. Section III turns to the legislative response in the U. S., describing the database legislation that has been introduced in the 104 th, 105 th, 106 th, and 108 th Congresses, and setting forth the principle arguments raised by proponents and opponents of the measures. Section III also contains a discussion of the draft Database Treaty that had been considered by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) in 1996. Section IV provides an assessment of the validity of the claims of the proponents of database legislation by placing the database debate in a deeper political and economic context. The conclusion is reached that sui generis database legislation would hamper the goals of promoting scientific progress, and that such attempts should be rejected by policymakers...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{underline}} the evolution and the importance of the European Directives in the field of copyright and related rights, their contribution to the development of the law and the national implementation, namely their transposition into Romanian Law no. 8 / 1996 on copyright and related rights. For this purpose, the article will analyze the historical evolution of the European Directives in the field of copyright and related rights and their most important dispositions. Given the wide range of subject matter with which it is concerned, the European Directives in the field of copyright and related rights address to enforcement, <b>protection</b> of <b>databases,</b> <b>protection</b> of computer programs, resale right, satellite and cable, term of protection, rental and lending rights, copyright and related rights in the information society, orphan works and management of copyright and related rights. Taking into account the wild range of subjects that European Directives in the field of copyright and related rights address, it is important to observe the permanent interest of the European legislator on the harmonization of the law on copyright and related rights. In this way, the result was the adoption of 7 directives in a 10 -year interval between 1991 and 2001, and of 4 directives, including the one for the modification of the Directive on the term of protection, also in a 10 -year interval between 2004 and 2014.
