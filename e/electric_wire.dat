5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone to failure due to <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E

25|$|Suspicious lesions may be cauterized, {{treated with}} laser light or cut with an <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> for {{purposes}} of biopsy or complete removal polypectomy. Medication can be injected, e.g. to control bleeding lesions. On average, the procedure takes 20–30 minutes, depending on the indication and findings. With multiple polypectomies or biopsies, procedure times may be longer. As mentioned above, anatomic considerations may also affect procedure times.|$|E
25|$|In 1856 Wilhelm Eduard Weber and Rudolf Kohlrausch {{performed}} an experiment {{to measure the}} numerical value of {{the ratio of the}} electromagnetic unit of charge to the electrostatic unit of charge. The result came out to be equal to the product of the speed of light and the square root of two. The following year, Gustav Kirchhoff wrote a paper in which he showed that the speed of a signal along an <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> was equal to the speed of light. These are the first recorded historical links between the speed of light and electromagnetic phenomena.|$|E

25|$|Bell {{did for the}} {{telephone}} what Henry Ford did for the automobile. Although {{not the first to}} experiment with telephonic devices, Bell and the companies founded in his name were the first to develop commercially practical telephones around which a successful business could be built and grow. Bell adopted carbon transmitters similar to Edison's transmitters and adapted telephone exchanges and switching plug boards developed for telegraphy. Watson and other Bell engineers invented numerous other improvements to telephony. Bell succeeded where others failed to assemble a commercially viable telephone system. It can be argued that Bell invented {{the telephone}} industry. Bell's first intelligible voice transmission over an <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> was named an IEEE Milestone.|$|E

The system was more effective than anticipated and the drainage system could not cope with the quantity of water produced from the melting of frost and snow. As a consequence the pitch had to be relaid in 1960 to allow a more suitable drainage system to be installed.|$|E
500|$|In Bellaire's early history, Bellaire Boulevard and a {{historic}} street car line connected Bellaire to Houston. The street car line, which ran a four-mile (6km) stretch from central Bellaire to Houston's Main Street, started construction in 1909. The streetcar line consisted of one railway track and an overhead <b>electric</b> <b>wire.</b> A waiting pavilion and a turnaround loop were {{located at the}} terminus in Bellaire. The Houston Electric Company had simultaneously constructed a south end line from Eagle Avenue {{to what is now}} Fannin Street to connect to the Bellaire Boulevard line. Service, with one required transfer at Eagle Avenue, began on December 28, 1910. The streetcar was nicknamed the [...] "Toonerville Trolley". On September 26, 1927, the trolley line was abandoned and replaced by a bus line. This was due to frequent derailments caused by a worn-out track and the advent of the automobile. In 1985, a similar streetcar was acquired in Portugal and brought to Bellaire for permanent display.|$|E

500|$|Frederick {{had been}} a heavy smoker for many years. At a ball held by William on 31 January 1887, a guest {{reported}} the Crown Prince [...] "was so hoarse that he could hardly say a word." [...] His hoarseness continued through February, and was diagnosed as a thickening of the mucous membrane over the vocal cords, caused by [...] "a chronic laryngeal catarrh." [...] On 7 February, Frederick consulted a doctor, Karl Gerhardt, who scraped a wire across the membrane for 10 days {{in an attempt to}} remove thickened tissue. After the procedure proved unsuccessful, Gerhardt cauterised the left vocal cord with an <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> on 15 March in an attempt to remove what was then thought to be a vocal fold nodule. Due to Frederick's highly inflamed throat, Gerhardt was unable to remove the entire growth. After several cauterisations, and with no signs of improvement, Frederick and his wife went to the spa of Bad Ems, where he drank the mineral waters and underwent a regimen of gargles and inhaling fresh air, with no effect.|$|E
500|$|Strong {{winds and}} gusts were {{reported}} across the Gulf Coast {{and in the}} Gulf of Mexico. [...] A ship reported a minimum central barometric pressure of [...] {{just prior to the}} storm's intensification into a hurricane. Grand Isle, Louisiana reported sustained winds of , and winds of at least [...] were reported as far east as Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. As a result, numerous trees were uprooted and power lines were downed. One death occurred New Orleans after being electrocuted by an <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> that had been downed by the hurricane's strong winds. The downed power lines also caused a lack of communication from areas affected, hampering relief efforts. In New Orleans, at least 2,500telephones were without service, and homes were unroofed by the strong winds. Along the coast and further inland, rainfall was concentrated primarily on the eastern half of the cyclone, with most rain occurring from September21 to the 23rd. In Robertsdale, Alabama, [...] of rain was recorded, the most associated with the hurricane. A 24–hour September rainfall record was set when [...] of rain was measured in Kelly, Louisiana. However, due to the system's rapid dissipation over land, rainfall amounts remained generally less than [...] in interior regions of Louisiana. In Texas, rainfall peaked at [...] in Beaumont. The heavy rains caused washouts and damage to railroads across Louisiana. A train running from Louisville, Kentucky to Nashville, Tennessee was left stranded after being washed out near Chef Menteur Pass, and other rail operations were stopped between New Orleans and Mobile, Alabama. Tides of [...] above average were reported in Lake Borgne and Mississippi Sound as the hurricane moved over the coast, while tides of [...] above average were reported in Biloxi, Mississippi. The strong storm surge caused considerable damage to Grand Isle and Manilla Village, Louisiana. Due to the hurricane's landfall near low tide, however, major storm surge impacts were mitigated. Overall infrastructural damage caused by the hurricane totaled to $750,000, while crop related damage, particularly to rice and sugar cane, totaled to $700,000.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} {{synopsis of}} the film {{was published in the}} Moving Picture World as follows: [...] "Professor Dix has won fame as a scientist and has collected many objects of Egyptian ware, centuries old, that arouse the enthusiasm of his associates. Even Jack Thornton, an active, go-ahead young businessman, is interested in the professor's home, but although he tries to pretend it is Egyptology which interests him, the professor's fair young daughter is really the lodestone. Jack decides to win the old man's respect by posing as an Egyptologist himself. To start his collection, he purchases a mummy at an auction sale, and takes it home expecting that later he can make a great hit with his sweetheart's father, by presenting it to him as a gift. While the mummy is in Jack's room, a live <b>electric</b> <b>wire</b> is by accident brought in contact with it. The body has been so perfectly mummified, that the electric current is all that is necessary to ignite the vital spark, and Jack is amazed to see dancing forth from the case which he thought contained only unattractive rags and bones, a beautiful Egyptian princess. As soon as she is released, the mummy makes violent love to Jack, and causes his sweetheart to quarrel with him (for how can a plain businessman explain the presence in his room of a beautiful barbarian?). When her love is spurned, the visitor from the distant past avenges herself by having Jack made into a mummy and placed in the case in her stead. Her heart relents, however, in time to save him from being 'cut up' by the professor, who with the sharp knife, starts to investigate the contents of the mummy case. But all ends happily when Jack's plain statements of the seemingly impossible facts are proved true by the professor. Jack is reunited to his sweetheart, and the professor, being a widower, also an ardent admirer of everything antique, leads the recreated Egyptian lady to the altar, {{in spite of the fact}} that there is a difference of several thousand years in their ages." ...|$|E

2500|$|Joseph Henry [...] (December 17, 1797– May 13, 1878) was an American {{scientist}} {{who served as}} the first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. He was the secretary for the National Institute for the Promotion of Science, a precursor of the Smithsonian Institution. He was highly regarded during his lifetime. While building electromagnets, Henry discovered the electromagnetic phenomenon of self-inductance. He also discovered mutual inductance independently of Michael Faraday, (1791–1867), though Faraday was the first to make the discovery and publish his results. Henry developed the electromagnet into a practical device. He invented a precursor to the electric doorbell (specifically a bell that could be rung at a distance via an <b>electric</b> <b>wire,</b> 1831) and electric relay (1835). The SI unit of inductance, the henry, is named in his honor. Henry's work on the electromagnetic relay was the basis of the practical electrical telegraph, invented by Samuel F. B. Morse and Sir Charles Wheatstone, separately.|$|E
