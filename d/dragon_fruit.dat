500|$|Almost any fleshy cactus {{fruit is}} edible. The word pitaya or {{pitahaya}} (usually {{considered to have}} been taken into Spanish from Haitian creole) {{can be applied to}} a range of [...] "scaly fruit", particularly those of columnar cacti. The fruit of the saguaro (Carnegiea gigantea) has long been important to the indigenous peoples of northwestern Mexico and the southwestern United States, including the Sonoran Desert. It can be preserved by boiling to produce syrup and by drying. The syrup can also be fermented to produce an alcoholic drink. Fruits of Stenocereus species have also been important food sources in similar parts of North America; Stenocereus queretaroensis is cultivated for its fruit. In more tropical southern areas, the climber Hylocereus undatus provides pitahaya orejona, now widely grown in Asia under the name <b>dragon</b> <b>fruit.</b> Other cacti providing edible fruit include species of [...] Echinocereus, Ferocactus, Mammillaria, Myrtillocactus, Pachycereus, Peniocereus and Selenicereus.

50|$|The {{local economy}} {{is based on}} the regencies natural resources, {{agriculture}} and plantations, horticulture as well as livestock and fish breeding. Many potentials in this regards are not yet tapped or require optimisation. Although there are no oil and gas reserves found in Kepahiang, the existing assets of the regency seem to provide a solid foundation for progressive economic development. The current challenge for the local government and farmers federations likewise is to balance the interest of large corporations and locals so that aspects such as market integration, internationalisation, the generation of local income and the agrucultural diversification are brought into harmony. The dependency of local peasants on certain agricultural products such as coffee for instance shall be reduced by certain strategic agricultural programs. Programs like IKUTT and SELUNA do foster the aforementioned goals. IKUTT aims to structure the sector of livestock and fish breeding, horticulture and the cultivation of food plants whereas SELUNA is meant to manage and optimize the cultivation of sengon trees, <b>dragon</b> <b>fruits</b> and the production of luwak (civet cat) coffee.|$|R

40|$|Cacti {{are full}} of contradictions. Although many {{are found in the}} driest and most barren environments on earth, some grow {{exclusively}} in the branches of the rainforest canopy. Many species bristle with ferocious-looking spines, while other varieties are perfectly smooth. And while they might strike us as the most austere plants on earth, nearly all of them exhibit remarkable floral displays some even larger than the plant itself. In Cactus, Dan Torre explores these unique plants as they appear all around the world and throughout art, literature, and popular culture. As Torre shows, cacti have played a prominent role in human history for thousands of years. Some species were revered by ancient civilizations, playing a part in their religious ceremonies; other varieties have been cultivated for their medicinal properties and even as a source of dye, {{as in the case of}} the prickly pear cactus and the cochineal insect, the source of red carmine used in everything from food to lipstick. Torre examines how cacti have figured in low-footprint gardens, as iconic features of the landscapes of Westerns, and as a delicious culinary ingredient, from nutritious Nopal pads to alluring Pitaya or <b>Dragon</b> <b>fruits.</b> Entertaining and informative, this book will appeal to any of us who have admired these hardy, efficient plants.

40|$|As a {{first step}} for the {{biological}} control of pest insects using ants we surveyed the ant fauna and its seasonality on seven farm lands, six of which were greenhouses, {{in the southern part}} of Okinawa Island. Cultivated plants were <b>dragon</b> <b>fruits,</b> eggplants, bitter gourds, green peppers and sugarcanes. Ants were collected using pitfall traps every 2 month (with some exception) throughout 2006. Regardless of inside or outside the greenhouses ants were less active and less abundant in the low temperature period from January to March, whereas they were abundant and seemingly active in the high temperature period from May to October. The ant species composition did not differ very much by cultivated plant species. Four species (Tetramorium bicarinatum, Monomorium chinense, Pheidole fervens and P. parva) were most common in those fields, which implies that these four species can have the highest potential as the biological-control agents in the warm season in Okinawa, on one hand. On the other hand, a large portion of those dominant ants consists of exotic tramps species, therefore their risk of biological invasion should be also carefully estimated before using them as control agents. 沖縄におけるアリの生物的害虫防除への利用に向けた第一歩として，沖縄島の 7 ヶ所の圃場（そのうち 6 つはハウス）におけるアリ相と個体数の季節変動を約 1 年間調べた．ピットフォールトラップ法を用いて圃場の中とすぐ外の屋外環境で調査を行った．栽培作物はラン，ドラゴンフルーツ，ナス，ゴーヤ，サトウキビ，ピーマンであった．屋外，ハウスに限らずアリ類は気温が低い 1 月から 3 月は採取個体数・種数ともに少なく，気温が高い 5 月～ 10 月にかけて採取個体数・種数ともに多かった．栽培作物に よるアリ相に大きな違いはみられず，オオシワアリ，クロヒメアリ，ブギオオズアリ，ミナミオオズアリの遍在性が高く個体数も多かっ た．沖縄島の圃場でアリを害虫防除資材として利用する場合，これらの種が高温期に利用できる可能性があると考えられる．その一方で優占種の多くは外来の放浪種であり，利用時にはその侵略性のリスクの検討も必要である...|$|R

40|$|Red {{pitahaya}} or red <b>dragon</b> <b>fruits</b> (Hylocereus polyrhizus) {{are well}} known for their deep purple colour pulps due to the abundance of betacyanins and can be exploited as a potential source of natural food colourant. A pectinase-assisted extraction of betacyanins from pulps and peels of red pitahaya was carried out. The extraction efficiency was evaluated in terms of yield, betacyanin content (BC) and total sugar content. Without the use of pectinase, the highest yields of betacyanins from the pulps and peels of red pitahaya was obtained using 95 % ethanol and 50 % ethanol at a substrate to solvent ratio of 1 : 1 and 1 : 2., respectively. Using pectinase at a concentration of 1. 5 % and water as a solvent at a substrate to solvent ratio (w/v) of 1 : 1, a higher yield (17. 33 0. 35 %) of betacyanins with lower total sugar content (57. 85 4. 35 g/L) from pulps of red pitahaya was produced. Overall, the pulps of red pitahaya were found to produce higher yields of betacyanins compared to those from peels of red pitahaya. Betacyanins typically exist with high amounts of sugars (52 - 60 g/L) which are undesirable in the food processing industry. Therefore, a fermentation screening and optimisation {{study was conducted to}} remove the sugars and concentrate the betacyanins from the pulps of red pitahaya. Four species of lactic acid bacteria, Lactobacillus sp. (L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. rhamnosus and L. plantarum) and a yeast species, Saccharomyces cerevisiae were screened to determine the efficieny to ferment and concentrate betacyanins from red pitahaya. S. cerevisiae was found to concentrate betacyanins with lowest total sugar content (26. 4 2. 35 g/L). Hence, S. cerevisiae was chosen for the subsequent optimisation step. An optimisation step using response surface methodology (RSM) was performed to analyse the effects of fermentation conditions on the total sugar content, BC and yield of betacyanins from red pitahaya. This study optimised the fermentation conditions (temperature, duration, inoculum size and agitation speed) to achieve the maximum recovery of betacyanins. Temperature, time and agitation speed had a significant influence on the total sugar content and BC of fermentation-concentrated betacyanins from red pitahaya. The yield of betacyanins were significantly influenced by temperature and agitation speed. The optimum conditions obtained were as follows: temperature of 36 °C, duration of 16. 5 hr, inoculum size of 2. 7 % and agitation speed of 107 rpm. Under these fermentation conditions, at least 48 % of betacyanins with a BC of 126. 65 g kg- 1 and 5. 67 % of sugars were recovered. Next, the effects of temperature (30 °C, 50 °C, 85 °C and 100 °C) and pH treatment (pH 3, pH 4, pH 5 and pH 6) on the stability of betacyanins from red pitahaya (Hylocereus polyrhizus) and red beet (Beta vulgaris) [E- 162] were investigated over a 10 -week period of refrigerated storage at 4 °C with respect to BC and total colour changes (ΔE*). Reduction in BC was observed with increasing temperature in betalains from red pitahaya (121. 50 ± 0. 82 g kg- 1 - 108. 01 ± 1. 15 g kg- 1) and E- 162 (120. 02 ± 1. 10 g kg- 1 - 105. 63 ± 1. 43 g kg- 1). Ten weeks of refrigerated storage at 4 °C further increased the loss of BC (0. 20 – 12. 76 g kg- 1) and caused a very distinct total colour changes (ΔE* > 3) for all the heat treated betacyanins from red pitahaya and E- 162. The half-life (t 1 / 2) of BC in all heat treated betacyanins from red pitahaya and E- 162 ranged from 2057 to 36478 days. Immediately after pH treatment, the highest (6. 98 – 8. 59 %) loss of betacyanin was observed at pH 3. Ten weeks of refrigerated storage at 4 °C further increased the loss of BC (0. 30 – 27. 78 g kg- 1) and caused a very distinct total color change (ΔE* > 3) for all pH treated betacyanins. The half-life (t 1 / 2) of BC in all pH treated betacyanins from red pitahaya and E- 162 ranged from 4621 to 15753 days. The application of betacyanins from red pitahaya to simulate strawberry-red colour in three model food systems (milk, yoghurt and ice cream) was evaluated in comparison to E- 162. In milk, the effect of pasteurisation was found to be greater in E- 162 compared to betacyanins from red pitahaya. Likewise, a greater loss of BC and total colour changes was observed in milk or yoghurt containing E- 162. However, an approximate 0. 15 % increase of BC was observed in ice cream containing betacyanins from red pitahaya or E- 162 on day- 21 of storage at - 18 °C. Throughout the 7 -days, 14 -days or 21 -days of cold storage, only a small difference (ΔE* < 1. 5) was observed in total colour changes of milk, yoghurt or ice cream containing betacyanins from red pitahaya or E- 162, respectively. The microbial viability (S. thermophilus and L. bulgaricus) in yoghurt containing betacyanins was found to be better than that of plain yoghurt (without betacyanins). Yoghurts containing betacyanins (red pitahaya or E- 162) were also found to have lower syneresis than that of plain yoghurt. Ice-cream containing betacyanins from red pitahaya was found to have higher overruns compared to those of plain or E- 162 containing ice-cream while the apparent viscosity of ice-creams was not affected by the addition of betacyanins from red pitahaya or E- 162. The addition of betacyanins from red pitahaya or E- 162 was found to enhance the antioxidant properties of milk, yoghurt and ice cream. The sensory evaluation of milk, yoghurt and ice cream containing betacyanins from red pitahaya showed a better colour acceptability compared to those containing E- 162. Betacyanins from red pitahaya can therefore be used as a potential natural colourant to simulate strawberry-red colour in milk, yoghurt and ice cream...|$|R
