25|$|The {{force had}} navigated fairly far up river {{when they came}} under {{unexpected}} fire from Spanish Florida. The British soon silenced the fire, but Phillott decided to retreat as the river ahead was narrow (only 30 to 40 yards wide), with commanding heights and houses to their rear. During the withdrawal, the expedition was exposed to harassing fire for over ten hours. In all, the expedition cost the British three men killed and 15 wounded. Bartholomew, of Erebus, was hit four times. He took his first hit {{in his head and}} then a second ball hit his middle finger and thumb when <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up to feel the first wound. He was also hit in the neck and throat. Phillott too was wounded twice.|$|E
2500|$|One day in 1977 [...] {{he ran a}} {{race for}} me at Calder. [...] I walked up to him after he finished. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> up to wave, {{and there was a}} {{powerful}} explosion. [...] A bolt of lightning came out of the sky and hit him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> to Bill's {{pocket and}} took out a little green snake; then <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>'and</b> to Bill's trouser-pocket {{and took out}} a frog, while pore Bill's eyes looked as if they was corning out o' their sockets.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> in <b>his</b> {{pockets and}} walked over to the window.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> to <b>his</b> mouth forthwith, and {{uttered a}} {{peculiar}} cry.|$|R
2500|$|Denis Healey, {{a member}} of {{parliament}} from 1952 to 1992, later said this speech was [...] "the greatest parliamentary speech I ever heard... it had all the moral passion and rhetorical force of Demosthenes". The Daily Telegraph report of the speech said that [...] "as Mr Powell sat down, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> across his eyes. His emotion was justified, for {{he had made a}} great and sincere speech".|$|E
2500|$|The Tosefta {{reported}} that Jewish judicial proceedings adopted the oath that Abraham imposed in [...] And Rav Judah said that Rav {{said that the}} judge adjures the witness with the oath stated in [...] "And I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven." [...] Ravina explained that this accorded with the view of Rabbi Haninah bar Idi, who said that Jewish judicial proceedings require swearing by the Name of God. Rav Ashi replied that one might even say that it accorded with {{the view of the}} Rabbis, who said that a witness can be adjured with a Substitute for the Name of God. They concluded that the witness needs to hold something sacred in his hand, as Abraham's servant did when in [...] <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> under Abraham's thigh and held Abraham's circumcision. Rava said that a judge who adjures by [...] "the Lord God of heaven" [...] without having the witness hold a sacred object errs and has to repeat the swearing correctly. Rav Papa said that a judge who adjures with tefillin errs and has to repeat the swearing. The law follows Rava, but not Rav Papa, as tefillin are considered sacred.|$|E
2500|$|... 1,000 {{years before}} [...] "the Age of Arthur" [...] (approximately 1,033 {{years before the}} Present Day), Merlin and a friend, Adda, were deserters from an army and were {{trekking}} through a desert, desperate for water. Merlin saw a light and ran after it, revealed to be the Holy Grail, {{on top of a}} stone. Thinking that it was sacred, Merlin initially refuses to touch it, but his friend, Abbas, disregards his warnings and decides to drink from it anyway. When his friend grabbed it, he turned to ashes. Merlin then grabbed the grail after praying to God for permission, and was able to drink from it. When <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> down, he realized he had magic. The desert was no more — only lush greenery and forests. 500 years later, Merlin is at a village healing people, where his apprentice informs him of a woman who escaped a burning village. Merlin meets the woman, who introduces herself as Nimue. She wants revenge on Vortigan, the masked man responsible. She also had Middlemist flowers to offer, as their survival will guarantee a form of revenge. Merlin agrees to help her and places the seeds in a planter, and he uses his magic to grow them instantly. Over {{the course of the next}} several months, they fall in love, and Merlin reveals the truth about the Grail and how he acquired magic. He expresses a wish to reforge the grail into a sword that can destroy his immortality, so that he can live a normal mortal life with Nimue as his wife. However, as they start their quest, it turns out that Vortigan has been watching them.|$|E
