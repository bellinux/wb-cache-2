500|$|A {{significant}} plot {{element is}} House's use of Vicodin to manage pain, {{caused by an}} infarction in his quadriceps muscle five years before the show's first season, which also forces him to use a cane. In the first season, 11th episode [...] "Detox", House admits he is addicted to Vicodin, but {{says he does not}} have a problem because the pills [...] "let me <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>job,</b> and they take away my pain". His addiction has led his colleagues, Cuddy and Dr. James Wilson, to encourage him to go to drug rehabilitation several times. When he has no access to Vicodin or experiences unusually intense pain, he occasionally self-medicates with other narcotic analgesics such as morphine, oxycodone, and methadone. House also frequently drinks liquor when he is not on medical duty, and classifies himself as a [...] "big drinker". Toward the end of season five, House begins to hallucinate; after eliminating other possible diagnoses, Wilson and he determine that his Vicodin addiction is the most likely cause. House goes into denial about this for a brief time, but {{at the close of the}} season finale, he commits himself to Mayfield Psychiatric Hospital. In the following season's debut episode, House leaves Mayfield with his addiction under control. However, about a year and a half later, in season seven's 15th episode, [...] "Bombshells", House reacts to the news that Cuddy possibly has kidney cancer by taking Vicodin, and his addiction recurs.|$|E
