40|$|DoIT's Academic Technology and the UW-Madison Library's Office of Scholarly Communication and Publishing {{conducted}} {{discussion group}} meetings with invited participants representing {{a broad spectrum}} of faculty and administrative interests, focusing on digital asset management in the context of evolving technology-driven forms of scholarship, the reassessment of traditional dichotomies between pedagogy and research, and rising tension between central and distributed IT. Participant feedback provided insight into several problem areas, highlighting that attempts by DoIT to assist digital resource management must take into account problems with current institutional focus and resource allocation; that the loss of the culture of curatorship in the transition to a digital scholarly record severely threatens the preservation of institutional memory; and that adoption of solutions depends upon the implementation of trusted, comprehensive, interfederated identity management and access control. To address these concerns, DoIT should promote emerging open access paradigms in publication and the open data movement in research, collaborating with campus partners to provide encouragement and education in order to promote the growth of the new culture of digital curatorship. Further, DoIT should support emerging cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional social networks, providing liaison functions and facilitating coordination between potential partners, discovering opportunities for collaboration, and providing resources to seed their growth. This activity should take place in partnership with distributed IT staff, developing solutions and services that directly address the needs of their <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas,</b> and <b>Involving</b> them directly through shared decision-making and collaborative work. Developed solutions should emphasize integration and interoperability as primary characteristics. Finally, DoIT should adopt open, standards-based identity management and access control mechanisms that support interfederation of credentials and access control policies.

40|$|In Italy, a Continuing Medical Education (CME) {{program that}} engages about one million health {{professionals}} involved with different roles in National Health Service (physicians, nurses, biologists, pharmacologists, psychologists, veterinarians, technicians, etc) became officially mandatory on January 1, 2008. In Italy, the traditional form of acquiring CME credits is to attend lectures and conferences, while the main structured online service was dismissed in November 2008. The Italian Ministry of Health required health professionals to obtain 50 credits/y, with no obligation toward scientific production. In this study, we have preliminarily evaluated {{the potential impact}} of a compulsory CME program on the research production of our transplantation center. We selected the research products published by surgeons (n = 10) and university researchers (n = 2) who were on duty in our center from 1995 to 2007. For this period, PubMed returned 89 research products with at least one surgeon/researcher of our center as author/coauthor. The mean number of published research products/y was 6. 84 +/- 4. 5. The number of expected research products for 2008 and 2009 {{on the basis of a}} time series analysis applied to the period 1995 to 2007 was 12. 35 and 12. 91, respectively. A search in PubMed restricted to 2008 and 2009 (from January 1 to November 23) returned in both years eight research products. Considering that in our center there was no increase in volume activities or changes in whole working processes, it seems reasonable to assume that the new compulsory, time-consuming Italian CME program may have played a role in the decline of scientific production. A systematic monitoring should be started with the aim to investigate {{the potential impact of}} the Italian CME program on biomedical research output, especially for centers and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas</b> mainly <b>involved</b> in clinical research...|$|R

40|$|This Working Paper {{comprises}} {{a literature}} review that {{was carried out}} to inform the formulation of a research project on power, violence, citizenship and agency, which addresses how social actors react to complex, violence-prone contexts. It reviews recent literature on citizen agency, social agency, leadership, violence and conflict from various disciplines including security studies, conflict studies, social theory, psychology, anthropology, development studies and gender studies. It focuses on the way that agency is conceptualised in each field. While all the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas</b> covered acknowledge that agency exists in complex violent settings, few studies refer to transformative agency for prevention or transformation of violent conflict, instead framing agency in terms of participating in violent activities, coping mechanisms for sustaining life in violent circumstances, or maintaining ‘ordinary life’ during conflict.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{discusses}} a new Bachelor of Science in Software Engineering (BSSE) that {{is offered}} via a collaboration of three departments of one university. The sponsors span the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas</b> of computer science, computer engineering, and information systems. The combination of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas</b> helps provide a broad {{foundation for the}} program.

40|$|Entrepreneurship {{education}} is an increasingly popular <b>disciplinary</b> <b>area</b> at universities. Usually offered within schools of business management, {{growth over the}} last 30 years has been phenomenal. The rationale for offering courses in Entrepreneurship has often been stated as (a) {{to raise awareness of}} entrepreneurship as a career option, (b) to motivate students to consider a venturing career, and (c) to provide students with the knowledge and skills to venture. These three aims can be summarized as teaching “about ” entrepreneurship and also the “how to ” of entrepreneurship. This paper marks {{the first step in a}} broad-based review of entrepreneurship education in terms of learning objectives, learning process and learning outcomes. Theoretical model development, drawing on cognitive psychology, educational psychology and a range of motivational theories provides a starting point in understanding the teaching and learning process in relation to entrepreneurship. This paper examines aspects of educational and cognitive psychology from a purely theoretical stance. This information is then utilized in the development of a model (Table 2) specifically aimed at enhancing the teaching and learning process. This model will be of use in a variety of educational and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>areas,</b> as well as a range of educational settings...|$|R
