5|$|Afternoon is {{the time}} of the day between noon and evening. It {{is the time}} when the sun is {{descending}} from its zenith in the sky to somewhat before its terminus at the horizon in the west direction. In human life, it occupies roughly {{the latter half of the}} standard work and school day. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with a number of concerns related to health, safety, and economic productivity: generally, the early afternoon, after most people have eaten lunch, corresponds to decreased work performance, decreased alertness, and a higher incidence of motor vehicle accidents. It is usually from 12 PM to 6 PM, but during winter it may be from 12 PM to 4 PM and during summer it may be from 12 PM to 8 PM.|$|E
5|$|The {{causes of}} plantar {{fasciitis}} {{are not entirely}} clear. Risk factors include overuse such as from long periods of standing, an increase in exercise, and obesity. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with inward rolling of the foot and a lifestyle that involves little exercise. While heel spurs are frequently found it is unclear {{if they have a}} role in causing the condition. Plantar fasciitis is a disorder of the insertion site of the ligament on the bone characterized by micro tears, breakdown of collagen, and scarring. As inflammation plays a lesser role, many feel the condition should be renamed plantar fasciosis. The diagnosis is typically based on signs and symptoms with ultrasound sometimes used to help. Other conditions with similar symptoms include osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, heel pad syndrome, and reactive arthritis.|$|E
5|$|The region between Geraldton and Gingin {{is a rich}} one for Abietinae banksias, {{and nine}} species occur there. Despite this, there is little overlap in range and habitat; Banksia scabrella is unusual in its co-occurrence with B. leptophylla. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with the {{endangered}} heath shrub Leucopogon marginatus. Burma Road Nature Reserve {{is one of the}} few protected conservation areas in its range; there, Banksia scabrella is found most commonly in (and forms a prominent part of) a mallee sedgeland, which is dominated by the cord rush Ecdeiocolea monostachya as a ground cover, and the mallee Eucalyptus eudesmoides as an emergent species. It is found occasionally in acacia scrub-heath, and rarely in acacia thickets and banksia woodland. An assessment of the potential impact of climate change on this species found that its range is unlikely to contract and may actually grow, depending on how effectively it migrates into newly habitable areas.|$|E

The party contested the 1922 federal election, but with little success, and ceased to exist shortly afterwards.|$|R
50|$|The {{creation}} of highways {{in some cases}} divided and isolated black neighborhoods from goods and services, many times within industrial corridors. For example, Birmingham's interstate highway system attempted to maintain racial boundaries established by the city’s 1926 racially based zoning law. The construction of interstate highways through black neighborhoods in the city led to significant population loss in those neighborhoods. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> {{with an increase in}} neighborhood racial segregation.|$|R
25|$|The {{underlying}} cause {{is believed to}} be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Risk factors include doing work that involves focusing on close objects, greater time spent indoors, and a family history of the condition. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with a high socioeconomic class. The underlying mechanism involves the length of the eyeball growing too long or less commonly the lens being too strong. It is a type of refractive error. Diagnosis is by eye examination.|$|E
25|$|The later Theosophical {{arrangement}} {{was taken up}} by Alice Bailey, and from there found its way (with variations) into the New Age worldview. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with the human aura observed through Kirlian photography and Kilner screens. The anthroposophical view {{of the human being}} found in Rudolf Steiner's Anthroposophical teachings usually referred to only the Etheric and Astral Bodies. However, Steiner also used a threefold classification of body, soul, and spirit as well as a sevenfold and a ninefold description.|$|E

40|$|Drug-induced {{agranulocytosis}} {{was defined}} as a severe selective neutropenia caused by an unexpected drug reaction. Metamizole was the most common nonopioid analgesic drug <b>associated</b> with agranulocytosis. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with combined blood dyscrasias and other severe immunologic disorders. The risk of agranulocytosis by metamizole seemed to be considerably higher than estimated formerly. Modern management with broad-spectrum antibiotics and haematopoietic growth factors reduced the mortality in those patients. Two cases of agranulocytosis caused by metamizole were reported...|$|R

It then controlled three trading houses in Brest, Nantes and Orleans, {{the bank of}} Gamba, Gay et compagnie in Antwerp as well as having large shareholdings in three companies in Paris (Girardot et compagnie, Rougemont et compagnie, Charlemagne et compagnie). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with three major suppliers: Vanlerberghe (wheat), the Michel brothers (military supplies) and Carvillon des Tillières et Roy (steel and wood).|$|R
50|$|In 2004, the Medicines and Healthcare {{products}} Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the United Kingdom judged fluoxetine (Prozac) to be {{the only}} antidepressant that offered a favorable risk-benefit ratio in children with depression, though <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with a slight increase in the risk of self-harm and suicidal ideation. Only two SSRIs are licensed for use with children in the UK, sertraline (Zoloft) and fluvoxamine (Luvox), and only for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Fluoxetine is not licensed for this use.|$|R
25|$|Its {{entry in}} Cancer in 1913, the sign {{in which it}} was later discovered, coincided with World War I. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with nuclear armament, which had its genesis in the {{research}} of the 1930s and 40s. Later on, it gave rise to the polarized nuclear stand off of the Cold War, with the mass consumer societies of the United States and other democracies facing the totalitarian state of the USSR. The discovery of Pluto also occurred just after the birth of modern psychoanalysis, when Freud and Jung began to explore the depths of the unconscious.|$|E
25|$|Astrologically speaking, the Moon is {{associated}} with a person's emotional make-up, unconscious habits, rhythms, memories, moods and their ability to react and adapt to those around them. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with the mother, maternal instincts or the urge to nurture, the home, the need for security and the past, especially early experiences and childhood. The 1st-century poet Manilius described the Moon, or Luna, as melancholic. In medicine, the Moon {{is associated}} with the digestive system, stomach, breasts, the ovaries and menstruation (which does occur on a monthly cycle) and the pancreas. Despite Manilius's assignation, the Moon is commonly associated with the phlegmatic humor; it ruled the animal spirits. In modern astrology, the Moon is the primary native ruler of the fourth house, but traditionally it had its joy in the third house.|$|E
25|$|In women, menstrual {{disturbances}} {{are common}} during spironolactone treatment, with 10 to 50% of women experiencing them at moderate doses {{and almost all}} experiencing them at a high doses. Most women taking moderate doses of spironolactone develop amenorrhea, and normal menstruation usually returns within two months of discontinuation. Spironolactone produces an irregular, anovulatory pattern of menstrual cycles. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with metrorrhagia and menorrhagia (or menometrorrhagia) in {{a large percentage of}} women. It has no birth control effect. It has been suggested that the weak progestogenic activity of spironolactone is responsible for these effects, although this has not been established and spironolactone has been shown to possess insignificant progestogenic and antiprogestogenic activity even at high dosages in women. An alternative proposed cause is inhibition of 17α-hydroxylase and hence sex steroid metabolism by spironolactone and consequent changes in sex hormone levels.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> {{with the}} San Juan de Dios Hospital which functioned as the college's {{clinical}} arm as decreed by King Alfonso of Spain on October 29, 1875. This setup continued until 1941 when the Japanese took over Quezon Institute and transferring {{all of its}} medical staff and patients to San Juan de Dios Hospital. Clinical training during this time was in partnership with Saint Paul Hospital in Intramuros until the walled city's destruction during the Liberation of Manila.|$|R
50|$|Refusal {{to stand}} during the {{national}} anthem became a widespread form of protest during World War I. In some cases, this was related to protest of conscription. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with support for Socialism, Bolshevism, or Communism. In one case, supporters of the Communism refused to stand during the song at a trial of Emma Goldman. The act of protest was very controversial, and many people were highly offended, so that even accidentally remaining seated could result in violence.|$|R

25|$|Ommaya’s cetripedal theory {{identified}} {{that the effects}} always begin at {{the surface of the}} brain in mild injury and extend inward to affect the diencephalic- mesencephalic core in more severe injury. His work showed that both translational and rotational acceleration produce focal lesions but that only rotational acceleration produced diffuse axonal injury. When damage is found in the rostral brainstem <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with diffuse hemispheric damage. Prior to his work it was believed that the mechanism of concussion was linked to primary brainstem injury. However, the brainstem and mesencephalon are the last structure to be affected in severe injury, and rotational rather than translational forces produce concussion. Contact phenomenon {{contribute to the development of}} focal lesions, e.g. frontal and temporal lesions due to contact with the sphenoid bone. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have supported these theories. They have confirmed that the distribution of lesions follows a centripetal pattern that follows injury severity identified by the Glascow Coma Score.|$|E
500|$|Romanticism {{has been}} seen as [...] "the revival of the life and thought of the Middle Ages", {{reaching}} beyond Rationalist and Classicist models to elevate medievalism and elements of art and narrative perceived to be authentically medieval, in an attempt to escape the confines of population growth, urban sprawl and industrialism, embracing the exotic, unfamiliar and distant. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> <b>associated</b> with political revolutions, beginning with those in Americana and France and movements for independence, particularly in Poland, Spain and Greece. It is often thought to incorporate an emotional assertion of the self and of individual experience along with a sense of the infinite, transcendental and sublime. In art there was a stress on imagination, landscape and a spiritual correspondence with nature. It has been described by Margaret Drabble as [...] "an unending revolt against classical form, conservative morality, authoritarian government, personal insincerity, and human moderation".|$|E
