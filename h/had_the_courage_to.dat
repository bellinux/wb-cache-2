Pietrangeli made acknowledgement that these people spurred the team on to punctilious documentation so that a full report of criteria and methods should be available to those who are interested, both in the present and the future.|$|E
5|$|The parishes {{were grouped}} into deaneries called Varados. Every parish {{was divided into}} wards, while Parish Councils were present in most parishes. About 15 percent of the {{households}} in the parishes were literate. A widow had to remain indoors, practically {{for the rest of}} her life. Since high-caste Hindu widows cannot remarry after the death of their husbands, the high-caste Christians too considered the remarriage of a widow as something unnatural. Canon law did allow remarriage for widows and therefore there was no direct prohibition for widows to remarry in the society of the Christians of South Canara. Few women <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> go against the strict conventions of their community. A widow who remarried was looked down upon, pitied, and shunned as unlucky. But she was not ill-treated or made an outcast, and no stigma was attached to her husband. Succession to property was practised as per the Hindu laws.|$|E

5|$|The Baltimore Sun runs {{a front-page}} story accusing the {{homicide}} unit of fumbling the investigation and protecting the Wilsons based on their race. Under pressure form his superiors, Gee demands they solve the murder immediately. Pembleton admits privately to his wife Mary (Ami Brabson) that he let his personal feelings of respect for Felix Wilson {{get in the way}} of the investigation; he agrees to make them a central part of the investigation. After searching the Wilson house, the detectives find love letters written by Hal Wilson to Brierre. Pembleton questions Felix and Hal, who agree to talk only if their statements are not admissible in court. Pembleton confronts the Wilsons with the love letters, which Hal said he never <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> give to Brierre. Felix said he would not have had sex with Brierre if he had known, which Hal said he does not believe. Felix demands the truth from Hal, who admits to killing Brierre in a jealous rage upon learning of her affair with his father.|$|E

25|$|Then Prime Minister Francesco Crispi and his Treasury Minister Giovanni Giolitti {{knew of the}} 1889 {{government}} inspection report, but {{feared that}} exposure might undermine public confidence and suppressed the report. In addition, they also wanted to avoid it becoming known that the Banca Romana, like other banks, had extended substantial loans to politicians (including themselves), often without interest. This was a common way for politicians to finance election expenses in return for favours. Over {{the next three years}} there was much talk of the need for a single note-issuing bank and for a reduction in the note circulation.

Gail Murray in Boyhood in America called it [...] "moving" [...] and Children Experience Literature said it was a [...] "grimly realistic picture of warfare and its effect on both soldiers and civilians". According to the International Reading Association, while reading it [...] "children may be helped to understand that history is always someone's interpretation...

500|$|The {{idea for}} what would become Annie Hall was {{developed}} as Allen walked around New York City with co-writer Marshall Brickman. The pair discussed the project on alternate days, sometimes becoming frustrated and rejecting the idea. Allen wrote a first draft of a screenplay within a four-day period, sending it to Brickman to make alterations. According to Brickman, this draft centered on {{a man in his}} forties, someone whose life consisted [...] "of several strands. One was a relationship with a young woman, another was a concern with the banality of the life that we all live, and a third an obsession with proving himself and testing himself to find out what kind of character he had. Allen himself turned forty in 1975, and Brickman suggests that [...] "advancing age" [...] and [...] "worries about death" [...] had influenced Allen's philosophical, personal approach to complement his [...] "commercial side". Allen made the conscious decision to [...] "sacrifice some of the laughs for a story about human beings". He recognized {{that for the first time}} he <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>courage</b> <b>to</b> abandon the safety of complete broad comedy and had the will to produce a film of deeper meaning which would be a nourishing experience for the audience. He was also influenced by Federico Fellini's 1963 comedy-drama 8½, created at a similar personal turning point, and similarly colored by each director's psychoanalysis.|$|E
