40|$|SummaryThe {{steady-state}} {{concept of}} Na+ homeostasis, based on short-term investigations {{of responses to}} high salt intake, maintains that dietary Na+ is rapidly eliminated into urine, thereby achieving constant total-body Na+ and water content. We introduced the reverse experimental approach by <b>fixing</b> <b>salt</b> intake of men participating in space flight simulations at 12 g, 9 g, and 6 g/day for months and tested for the predicted constancy in urinary excretion and total-body Na+ content. At constant salt intake, daily Na+ excretion exhibited aldosterone-dependent, weekly (circaseptan) rhythms, resulting in periodic Na+ storage. Changes in total-body Na+ (± 200 – 400  mmol) exhibited longer infradian rhythm periods (about monthly and longer period lengths) without parallel changes in body weight and extracellular water and were directly related to urinary aldosterone excretion and inversely to urinary cortisol, suggesting rhythmic hormonal control.

The particles are modeled by hard cuboids with their edges constrained to be {{parallel to the}} artesian axes corresponding to the Zwanzig model. The charges of the particles are concentrated in their center. The density functional is derived by functional integration of {{an extension of the}} Debye-Hückel pair distribution function with respect to the interaction potential.

With increasing platelet charge, the isotropic and nematic binodals are shifted to higher densities. The Donnan potential between the coexisting isotropic and nematic phases is inferred from bulk structure calculations. Non-monotonic density and nematic order parameter profiles are found at a free interface interpolating between the coexisting isotropic and nematic bulk phases.

40|$|Aerosols {{are known}} to {{influence}} significantly the radiative budget of the Earth. Although the direct effect (whereby aerosols scatter and absorb solar and thermal infrared radiation) has a large perturbing influence on the radiation budget, the indirect effect (whereby aerosols modify the microphysical and hence the radiative properties and amounts of clouds) poses a greater challenge to climate modellers. This is because aerosols undergo chemical and physical changes while in the atmosphere, notably within clouds, and are removed largely by precipitation. The way in which aerosols are processed by clouds depends on the type, abundance and the mixing state of the aerosols concerned. A parametrization with sulphate and sea-salt aerosol has been successfully integrated within the Hadley Centre general circulation model (GCM). The results of this combined parametrization indicate a significantly reduced role, compared with previous estimates, for sulphate aerosol in cloud droplet nucleation and, consequently, in indirect radiative forcing. However, in this bicomponent system, the cloud droplet number concentration, Nd (a crucial parameter that is used in GCMs for radiative transfer calculations), is a smoothly varying function of the sulphate aerosol loading. Apart from sea-salt and sulphate aerosol particles, biomass aerosol particles are also present widely in the troposphere. We find that biomass smoke can significantly perturb the activation and growth of both sulphate and sea-salt particles. For a <b>fixed</b> <b>salt</b> loading, Nd increases linearly with modest increases in sulphate and smoke masses, but significant nonlinearities are observed at higher non-sea-salt mass loadings.

Therefore, male Wistar rats were studied after a <b>fixed</b> <b>salt</b> diet had been maintained (low-salt group: 0. 05 % NaCl, n = 10; normal-salt group: 0. 3 % NaCl, n = 10) for 6 weeks. Blood pressure and sodium excretion values were measured once a week. Subsequently the rats were killed, the aorta was removed, and rings were cut. Endothelium-independent (sodium nitrite (SN)) and endothelium-dependent (acetylcholine (ACh)) vasodilator responses were assessed in the presence of indomethacin (a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor) and in {{the presence or absence of}} NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA; a competitive inhibitor of nitric oxide (NO) synthase). Endothelium-independent vasodilatation was not different for the two salt groups. Endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, on the other hand, was different. The response to ACh was almost completely abolished by L-NMMA in the normal-salt group, whereas vasodilatation was partially preserved during L-NMMA in the low-salt group. Accordingly, the L-NMMA-sensitive contribution to ACh-dependent vasodilatation was smaller in the low-salt group. Thus, salt restriction induced a non-NO and non-prostaglandin-dependent vasodilating pathway. By exclusion this could be endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor, a pathway of vasculoprotective potential. Accordingly, the relative contributions of the different vasoactive endothelial pathways were affected by salt intake.

The subjects' daily menus consisted of 27 279 individual servings, of which 83. 0 % were completely consumed, 16. 5 % completely rejected, and 0. 5 % incompletely consumed. Urinary recovery of dietary salt was 92 % of recorded intake, indicating long-term steady-state sodium balance in both studies. Even at <b>fixed</b> <b>salt</b> intake, 24 -hour urine collection for sodium excretion (UNaV) showed infradian rhythmicity. We defined a ± 25 mmol deviation from the average difference between recorded sodium intake and UNaV as the prediction interval to accurately classify a 3 -g difference in salt intake. Because of the biological variability in UNaV, only every other daily urine sample correctly classified a 3 -g difference in salt intake (49 %). By increasing the observations to 3 consecutive 24 -hour collections and sodium intakes, classification accuracy improved to 75 %. Collecting seven 24 -hour urines and sodium intake samples improved classification accuracy to 92 %. We conclude that single 24 -hour urine collections at intakes ranging from 6 to 12 g salt per day were not suitable to detect a 3 -g difference in individual salt intake. Repeated measurements of 24 -hour UNaV improve precision. This knowledge could be relevant to patient care and the conduct of intervention trials...|$|R

We measure ionic conductivity, σ, and glass transition temperature, T_g, in mixtures of polymer and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (LiTFSI) salt. While T_g {{is known to be}} an important factor in the ionic conductivity of polymer electrolytes, recent work indicates that the number and proximity of lithium ion solvation sites in the polymer also play an important role, but this effect has yet to be systematically investigated. Here, adding aliphatic linkers to a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) backbone lowers T_g and dilutes the polar groups; both factors influence ionic conductivity. To isolate these effects, we introduce a two-step normalization scheme. In the first step, Vogel–Tammann–Fulcher (VTF) fits are used to calculate a temperature-dependent reduced conductivity, σ_r(T), which is defined as the conductivity of the electrolyte at a fixed value of T – T_g. In the second step, we compute a nondimensional parameter f_(exp), defined as the ratio of the reduced molar conductivity of the electrolyte of interest to that of a reference polymer (PEO) at a <b>fixed</b> <b>salt</b> concentration. We find that f_(exp) depends only on oxygen mole fraction, x_ 0, and is to a good approximation independent of temperature and salt concentration. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed on neat polymers to quantify the occurrences of motifs that are similar to those obtained in the vicinity of isolated lithium ions. We show that f_(exp) is a linear function of the simulation-derived metric of connectivity between solvation sites.

Block polymers provide an accessible route to structured, composite materials by combining {{two or more}} components with disparate mechanical, chemical, and electrical properties into a single bulk material with nanoscale domains. However, the characteristic lengthscale of these systems is limited, and the choice of components is restricted to those {{that are able to}} undergo microstructural ordering at accessible temperatures. This thesis details routes to overcoming these limitations through the addition of a lithium salt, a blend of homopolymers, or both. Chapter 2 describes a study wherein complex sphere phases such as the Frank-Kasper sigma phase can be observed in otherwise disordered asymmetric block polymers through the addition of a lithium salt. Chapter 3 discusses the development and characterization of a ternary polymer blend of an AB diblock copolymer and A and B homopolymers doped with a lithium salt. Detailed characterization showed that doping blends that are otherwise disordered with lithium salt induced microstructural ordering and largely recovers the phase behavior of traditional ternary polymer blends. A systematic study of the ionic conductivity of the blends at a <b>fixed</b> <b>salt</b> concentration demonstrates that, at a given composition, disordered, yet highly structured blends consistently exhibit better conductivity than polycrystalline morphologies with long range order.

40|$|Due to the {{presence}} of long-ranged electrostatic interactions, polyelectrolyte solutions are characterized by a length scale in addition to the radius of gyration and the correlation length, the Debye screening length. Contrasted to the behavior observed in neutral polymer solutions in which miscibility is controlled by molecular weight and temperature, the inverse-square Debye length additionally controls polyelectrolyte phase behavior. ^ This thesis project experimentally investigated the influence of added barium chloride on both the collective and configurational properties of a model polyelectrolyte, sodium-poly (styrene sulfonate). Regarding the collective properties the crossover from mean field to Ising criticality close to the precipitation phase boundary was measured. This crossover was demonstrated for both salt-dependent and temperature-dependent thermodynamics. A mean field model qualitatively describes the collective behavior in polyelectrolyte solutions as a competition between a short-ranged chemical mismatch, governed by a Flory-Huggins interaction parameter, that disfavors miscibility and a repulsive screened-Coulombic interaction between monomers that favors miscibility. The addition of salt screens the electrostatic interaction such that it becomes short-ranged, leading to the observed precipitation at fixed temperature. Similarly, for a <b>fixed</b> <b>salt</b> concentration, the solvent quality is tuned and precipitation is observed upon lowering temperature. ^ The configurational properties of labeled chains were also examined as a function of molecular weight, polymer concentration, and salt concentration. In solutions without any added salts, we observe scaling laws for low-ionic strength semidilute polyelectrolyte solutions in agreement with the double screening theory. These scaling laws, along with the adequate fits of the labeled chain structure factor with the Debye structure factor, highlight the concept of screening in semidilute solutions and polyelectrolytes obeys Gaussian chain statistics on length scales of the order of a renormalized Kuhn length. Significant coil contraction is measured upon the addition of the multivalent salt. Upon comparing the correlation length, the radius of gyration, and the Debye length, the radius of gyration remains the dominant length scale in the system, until a crossover is observed as the correlation length diverges and surpasses the labeled chain dimension with increased ionic strength. ^ The double screening theory was applied to understand the dependence of size of the labeled chains as functions of polymer concentration and added multivalent salt. It was necessary to include the influence of ion-pairing into a salt-concentration de pendent degree of ionization. Such ion-pair formation is also necessary to calculate phase diagrams with better qualitative agreement with experimental data. These initial efforts should foster strong theoretical and simulation studies and further experimentation in the area of polyelectrolyte solutions. ...|$|R

Results: After the mice were orally administered with corn silk extract, the blood glucose and the HbA 1 c were significantly decreased in alloxan-induced hyperglycemic mice (p 0. 05). Although corn silk extract increased the level of hepatic glycogen in the alloxan-induced hyperglycemic mice, there was no significant difference between them and that of the control group(p > 0. 05). Conclusion: Corn silk extract markedly reduced hyperglycemia in alloxan-induced diabetic mice. The action of corn silk extract on glycaemic metabolism is not via increasing glycogen and inhibiting gluconeogenesis but through increasing insulin level as well as recovering the injured beta-cells. The results suggest that corn silk extract may be used as a hypoglycemic food or medicine for hyperglycemic people in terms of this modern pharmacological study. Background: Corn silk contains proteins, vitamins, carbohydrates, Ca, K, Mg and Na <b>salts,</b> <b>fixed</b> and volatile oils, steroids such as sitosterol and stigmasterol, alkaloids, saponins, tannins, and flavonoids. Base on folk remedies, corn silk {{has been used as}} an oral antidiabetic agent in China for decades. However, the hypoglycemic activity of it has not yet been understood in terms of modern pharmacological concepts.

40|$|Membrane ionic {{resistance}} is usually measured by immersing the membrane in a salt solution at a single, <b>fixed</b> concentration. While <b>salt</b> concentration {{is known to}} affect membrane resistance when the same concentration is used {{on both sides of}} the membrane, little is known about membrane resistance when the membrane is placed between solutions of different concentrations, such as in a reverse electrodialysis (RED) stack. Ionic resistance measurements obtained using Selemion CMV and AMV that separated sodium chloride and ammonium bicarbonate solutions of different concentrations were greater than those measured using only the high-concentration solution. Measured RED stack resistances showed good agreement with resistances calculated using an equivalent series resistance model, where the membranes accounted for 46 % of the total stack resistance. The high area resistance of the membranes separating different salt concentration solutions has implications for modeling and optimizing membranes used in RED systems...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} found that the gas {{chromatography}} of ammonia on certain <b>fixed</b> phases containing <b>salts</b> yields chromatograms consisting of a peak followed by a plateau or a succession of plateaux of progressively decreasing height. Such chromatograms have been interpreted in terms of ammine formation in the column and methods have been theoretically elaborated for using measurements on the chromatograms to find the dissociation pressures of the ammines and the ratios of ammonia taken up to silver in the fixed phase. These methods require the calibration of the detector, so that ammonia partial pressures can be found from chromatogram heights, and this has been done by a chromatographic method. In most cases, the ratio of ammonia to silver in the fixed phase does not yield conclusive information on ammnine composition, because there is usually evidence that the salt is present in different forms or is only partially converted to ammine...|$|R
40|$|The {{percentage}} uptake of [123 l]metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) by {{tumors of the}} paraganglion {{system is}} compared {{with the number of}} neurosecretory granules (assessed by both light and electron microscopy) in the subsequently resected tumors in six patients. lodine- 123 MIBG was injected intravenously; the tumor uptake of [123 I]MIBG varied between 0. 001 % and 0. 14 % of the injected dose per gram of tumor tissue at 22 hr. The number of neurosecretory granules in tissue sections was scored on a scale of l-lll. A direct proportional correlation was found between the percentage uptake of [123 I]MIBG by the tumor and the number of neurosecretory granules in the tissue sections but not with plasma or urinary catecholamines. This technique for imaging reflects the storage status of the tumor better than plasma and urinary catecholamine measurements. J NucÃ-Med 28 : 973 - 978, 1987 he paraganglion system comprises collections of neuroepithelial cells scattered throughout the body. The definitive common feature of these cells is the presence of numerous neurosecretory granules containing cate cholamines in their cytoplasm (7). Paragangliomas are the better differentiated tumors arising from this system and their cells contain numerous catecholamine gran ules. Pheochromocytomas are paragangliomas of the adrenal medulla. Neuroblastomas and ganglioneuro-blastomas are poorly differentiated tumors believed to arise from precursors of this system, and these two tumors contain fewer cytoplasmic catecholamine gran ules. Neurosecretory granules containing catecholamines have the ability to <b>fix</b> chrome <b>salts</b> and have been described as chromaffin if this property is easily demon strable and nonchromaffin if it is not. However, chro-maffinicity depends very much on type and pH of fixation, does not correspond specifically to adrenalin...|$|R
30|$|Table  2 {{shows that}} the {{inflection}} point temperature of the La 2 O 3 blended pulverized coal, which represents the initial release of volatile compounds, decreased by 18.3  °C {{compared with that of}} the raw coal. Besides, the first peak point (the combustion of volatile compounds) and the second peak point (the delayed release of volatile compounds) of the La 2 O 3 blended pulverized coal also decreased by 22.7 and 2.3  °C respectively. This is because the combustion of carbon is a gas–solid two phase reaction. Electromotive force exists on the contact surface between the reactants of the two phases. Because La 3 + has empty d and f orbits to accept lone pair electrons, unsaturated oxygen-containing hydrocarbon functional groups could grow together and form La 3 +(CO−) 3 species on the <b>fixed</b> carbon (complex <b>salt).</b> This can reduce the potential energy barrier between reactants of the two phases and decrease the activation energy of the reactants, which thus reduces the temperature of the initial release of volatile compounds (Thoms et al. 1996; Morimasa et al. 2001).|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{comprehensive}} {{model has}} been established for calculating thermodynamic properties of multicomponent aqueous systems containing the Na+, K+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Cl− and NO− 3 ions. The thermodynamic framework {{is based on a}} previously developed model for mixed-solvent electrolyte solutions. The framework has been designed to reproduce the properties of salt solutions at temperatures ranging from the freezing point to 300 °C and concentrations ranging from infinite dilution to the fused salt limit. The {{model has been}} parameterized using a combination of an extensive literature database and new isopiestic measurements for thirteen salt mixtures at 140 °C. The measurements have been performed using Oak Ridge National Laboratory’s (ORNL) previously designed gravimetric isopiestic apparatus, which can also detect solid phase precipitation. In addition to various Na–K–Mg– Ca–Cl–NO 3 systems, results are reported for LiCl solutions. Water activities are reported for mixtures with a <b>fixed</b> ratio of <b>salts</b> {{as a function of the}} total apparent salt mole fraction. The isopiestic measurements reported here simultaneously reflect two fundamental properties of the system, i. e., the activity of water as a function of solution concentration and the occur-rence of solid–liquid transitions. The thermodynamic model accurately reproduces the ne...|$|R
