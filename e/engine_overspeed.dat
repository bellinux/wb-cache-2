50|$|On 12 February 1970, Douglas C-47 HK-1270 crashed at Puerto Infrida while {{attempting}} to return to Puerto Infrida Airport following an <b>engine</b> <b>overspeed.</b> The aircraft was operating a scheduled passenger flight. All twelve people on board were killed, as were a further two on the ground.|$|E
50|$|Following their {{investigation}} of the accident, the Norwegian Accident Investigation Board (AIBN) concluded {{that the cause of}} the accident was multiple fatigue cracks in the splined sleeve between the high-speed bendix shaft and the right-hand engine, which had caused damage to the <b>engine</b> <b>overspeed</b> protection system. The splined sleeve disintegrated, severing the high-speed shaft, which led to an overspeed of the right-hand power turbine which in turn burst, destroying the left-hand engine as well as to cutting control rods which made the helicopter uncontrollable.|$|E
5000|$|Large Diesel {{engines are}} {{sometimes}} {{fitted with a}} secondary protection device that actuates if the governor should fail. [...] This consists of a flap valve in the air intake. If the <b>engine</b> <b>overspeeds,</b> the air flow through the intake will rise to an abnormal level. This causes the flap valve to snap shut, starving the engine of air and shutting it down.|$|R
50|$|Most {{unregulated}} <b>engines</b> will <b>overspeed</b> {{should there}} be no or little load while power is applied.|$|R
50|$|In 1941, {{experiments}} with boosting the W.1's thrust by introducing a liquid coolant were initiated, the first fluid tried being liquid ammonia which proved too effective, {{resulting in the}} <b>engine</b> <b>overspeeding</b> and pushing the thrust and rpm indicators off the scales, before later trials changed to using water, and water-methanol. A system to trial the technique in the E.28/39 was devised but never fitted.|$|R
5000|$|The flight {{proceeded}} {{as normal}} until 06:50:07 hours when the <b>engine</b> <b>overspeed</b> light was observed {{for a short}} time. The co-pilot read out the corresponding information from the emergency checklist, before they continued the approach to land on Norne. At 06:52:41 hours the crew contacted Transocean Prospect, the oil platform that was handling radio communication with helicopters landing on Norne. At 06:54:42 hours they informed Bodø ATCC that they were leaving 2,000 ft., with an {{estimated time of arrival}} of 07:05 hours. According to the helicopter's cockpit voice recorder (CVR), the abnormal indications recurred at 06:55:37 hours before [...] "something strange" [...] was observed at 06:55:55 hours. A thud was heard at 06:56:30 hours; then, after a loud crunching sound 1.7 seconds later, the crew lost control over the aircraft. The helicopter fell to the sea from around 1,800 ft. and all on board were killed {{as a result of the}} impact. The wreckage sank and came to rest at a depth of 830 meters.|$|E
5000|$|On 26 January, Thresher made {{radar contact}} with a small convoy and soon spotted two ships {{steaming}} along beneath the overcast night skies. At 00:11, Thresher fired three bow torpedoes at a 1,266-ton freighter, then bent cleared the area. Her [...] "fish" [...] scored a bullseye, and the quarry disappeared within a minute. A second spread, 35 seconds after the first, claimed a 2,205-ton freighter. A third target made off to the south at high speed, [...] "spraying the ocean with five-inch ammunition". Resuming the approach at 00:20, Thresher doggedly tailed the Japanese ship for four hours before reaching a favorable attack position. Firing her last torpedoes at 04:46, Thresher began to build up speed and had just commenced a turn when one torpedo struck the enemy ship, causing a tremendous explosion. The blast slowed the freighter, but its tremendous concussion stopped Thresher dead in the water. All four main <b>engine</b> <b>overspeed</b> trips were actuated; cork insulation flew; lights broke; clocks stopped; and water poured down the antenna trunk. By the time Thresher regained battle readiness, the enemy {{was too far away}} to encourage further pursuit. Well within the range of shore-based aircraft, Thresher quit the chase. Escorts, alerted to the fact an American submarine was prowling in the vicinity, arrived on the scene and conducted a three-hour-long, futile, depth-charging.|$|E
50|$|In newer {{models of}} constant-speed {{propeller}}s, oil is pumped through the propeller shaft to push on a piston {{that drives the}} mechanism to change pitch. The flow of oil and the pitch are controlled by a governor, consisting of a speeder spring, flyweights, and a pilot valve. The tension of the speeder spring is set by the propeller control lever, which sets the RPMs. The governor will maintain that RPM setting until an <b>engine</b> <b>overspeed</b> or underspeed condition exists. When an overspeed condition occurs, the propeller begins to rotate faster than the desired RPM setting. This would occur as the plane descends and airspeed increases. The flyweights begin to pull outward due to centrifugal force which further compresses the speeder spring. As that happens, the piston moves forward, allowing the pilot valve to open and oil to flow from the oil sump into the hub. This increase in oil pressure will increase the {{pitch of the propeller}} angle causing it to slow back down to the desired RPM setting. When an underspeed condition occurs, as in a climb with loss of airspeed, just the opposite takes place. The airspeed decreases, causing the propeller to slow down. This will cause the flyweights to move inward due to a lack in centrifugal force and tension will be released from the speeder spring. As this happens, the piston will move in the opposite direction causing the pilot valve to allow oil to flow from the hub back to the oil sump. The propeller blade angle will now decrease to a lower pitch allowing the propeller to speed back up to the desired RPM setting. This process usually takes place frequently throughout flight.|$|E

50|$|Cleaner {{and more}} compact than most {{aircraft}} in its class, the 101 displayed relatively high performance when first flown in 1927. However, it {{was rejected by}} the Air Ministry due to its wood construction, which was seen as out of date. No other buyers could be found and no more aircraft were produced. Continued as a private venture, it first flew at Filton on 8 August 1927, piloted by Cyril Uwins, registered G-EBOW. With the VIA powerplant, Uwins achieved second place in the 1928 King's Cup race at an average speed of 159.9 mph. Subsequently used as a company hack and as a testbed for the 485 hp Bristol Mercury II nine-cylinder radial, it suffered wing centre section failure on 29 November 1929 while being subjected to <b>engine</b> <b>overspeeding</b> tests, the pilot, C. R. L. Shaw, bailing out successfully. This was the last wooden Bristol fighter built.|$|R
50|$|Although Harry Ricardo {{was deeply}} {{committed}} to the philosophy of sophisticated gasoline-fuelled piston engines for Britain’s World War Two fighter aircraft, he was equally aware of {{the potential of the}} gas turbine engine, and had already helped Frank Whittle with the combustion chamber and burner design of his prototype jet engine. Ricardo workshops fabricated the 90-odd burner-atomizers used in the engine, which was already undergoing testing. The other problem concerning Whittle was the question of the fuel supply to the jet engine and how the pressure in the system could be stabilized as the aircraft climbed and the ambient atmospheric pressure varied. No solution had yet been found, so Ricardo was asked to assist. He proposed a device, a relief valve subsequently named ‘Barostat’, which automatically reduced the pressure in the fuel lines as the aircraft gained altitude. This relieved the pilot of having to continuously adjust the throttle settings, and avoided the risk of the <b>engine</b> <b>overspeeding.</b>|$|R
40|$|NASA LeRC is {{continuing}} to study propulsion concepts for a horizontal takeoff and landing, fully reusable, two-stage-to-orbit vehicle. This will be capable of launching and returning a 10, 000 pound payload to a 100 nautical mile polar orbit using low-risk technology. The vehicle, Beta 2, is a derivative of the USAF/Boeing Beta vehicle {{which was designed to}} deliver a 50, 000 pound payload to a similar orbit. Beta 2 stages at Mach 6. 5 and about 100, 000 ft altitude. The propulsion system for the booster is an over/under turbine bypass engine/ramjet configuration. In this paper, several options for thrust augmentation were studied in order to improve the performance of this engine where there was a critical need. Options studies were turbine <b>engine</b> <b>overspeed</b> in the transonic region, water injection at a various turbine engine locations also during the transonic region, and water injection at the turbine engine face during high speed operation. The methodology, constraints, propulsion performance, and mission study results are presented...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{a model of}} a ship {{propulsion}} system containing an engine, turbocharger, propeller and ship was constructed. The purpose of the model is to be used in controller design and testing. This is motivated by the fact that testing large marine diesel engines is limited due to large costs and difficulty providing a proper testbed facility. First compressor and turbine models were developed by fitting parameters to manufacturer turbocharger maps. A novel compressor model was made from using exponential functions. The performance of the compressor model surpassed that of a model commonly used in literature. However, to conclude this in the general case, more testing has to be performed. The development of an accurate turbocharger model was stimulated by possibilities of variable area turbine, wastegate and exhaust gas recirculation control. This would again lead to better transient air-to-fuel ratio control, turbocharger speed control and the reduction of pollutants. % extrapolationExtensions were made to an existing mean value engine model developed in an earlier project work by the same author, this included an intercooler and overload protection. The overload protection works through the use of fuel limiters based of torque and scavenging air pressure. In simulations these limiters showed to effectively maintain the air-to-fuel ratio for perfect combustion, however, at an increased engine response time. It was argued that the limiters could be superfluous if appropriate control of the air-to-fuel ratio was achieved. The engine and turbocharger were put to the test in simulations. Despite the lack of turbocharger experimental data in low speed regions, the simulations proved that the turbocharger model could cope with low engine load conditions at reduced turbocharger speed. In fact, results show that the engine and turbocharger models worked excellent in the entire speed region. Furthermore a propeller and ship model was developed. These models were tested in simulations together with a PI engine speed controller. Due to limited fuel actuation an integrator anti-windup scheme had {{to be included in the}} controller. The simulations showed that the PI controller was able to follow a slowly changing speed setpoint. However, due to the fact that the model is nonlinear and that no linearization, gain scheduling or excessive parameter tuning was performed, more advanced controller performance was not investigated. Moreover, further research on creating controllers for the purpose of suppressing propeller load torque fluctuations and subsequent <b>engine</b> <b>overspeed</b> is recommended. The total ship propulsion system showed to work in accordance to expected performance. All in all, this thesis provided as an enlightenment of the parameters and principles that are important in control of propulsion plants. Furthermore, it gives a testing environment for control design of various applications. </p...|$|E
50|$|Investigation of {{propellers}} {{found new}} research had been halted when RLM {{decided to focus}} on jets, only to be resumed. The Mission's interviews were limited to Vereinigte Deutsche Metallwerke (United German Metalworks, VDM), and, at Göttingen, they interviewed Dr. Stüper, who tested VDM's reversible propeller. This three-bladed unit had links to two electric motors, which could change the pitch at two degrees per second for constant speed or 60-100° per second for braking (in reverse mode); it was scheduled for production early in 1945, {{to be used by}} the Dornier Do 335, Dornier Do 317, and Focke-Wulf Fw 190. Mission members visited VDM's forging works at Heddernheim, on the outskirts of Frankfurt. Dr Eckert, of VDM spin-off company Continental Metall Gesellschaft (Continental Metal Company, CMG) confirmed Stüper's claims, adding CMG contemplated switching to hydraulic cylinders. CMG also had a four-bladed project propeller that could eliminate <b>engine</b> <b>overspeeding,</b> by reducing pitch on two blades and increasing it on the other two. In addition, CMG had done some work on hollow propeller blades, one made from a simple rectangular tube with welded-on edges.|$|R
5000|$|In motor {{vehicles}} automatic transmissions will change gear {{to prevent the}} engine from turning too quickly. Additionally, almost all modern vehicles are fitted with an electronic rev limiter device that will cut fuel supply or sparks to the <b>engine</b> to prevent <b>overspeed.</b>|$|R
50|$|Although {{the drive}} chains held up admirably, {{the car was}} not without its problems. The {{tremendous}} amount of power at the front wheels caused massive torque steer, resulting in difficulty in keeping the car in a straight line. The rear engine contributed to unloading of the front wheels, which in turn caused the front <b>engine</b> to <b>overspeed.</b> Visibility was poor as well due to tire smoke from {{both ends of the}} car. This coupled with engine oil spray out of the valve cover breathers because of the pressure of the superchargers.|$|R
50|$|For {{air intake}} shut down, two {{distinct}} types are commonly utilized, i.e. butterfly valves and swing gate or guillotine valves. Because diesel engines ignite fuel using compression {{instead of an}} electronic ignition, shutting off the fuel source to a diesel engine will not necessarily stop the engine from running. When an external hydrocarbon, such as methane gas, {{is present in the}} atmosphere, it can be sucked into a diesel <b>engine</b> causing <b>overspeed</b> or over revving, potentially leading to a catastrophic failure and explosion. When actuated, ESD valves stop the flow of air and prevent these failures.|$|R
50|$|The MiG-25 was {{theoretically}} {{capable of}} a maximum speed of Mach 3+ and a ceiling of 27 km.

40|$|AbstractA trainer {{military}} aircraft, {{equipped with}} alternative internal combustion <b>engine,</b> experienced an <b>overspeed</b> during preflight operations.

The crankshaft is a critical item for the engine {{and in order to}} prevent other similar incidents a technical investigation took place. Therefore, this report shows the results obtained by fractography, metallographic, chemical analysis and numerical simulation: the root cause of the cracks was the embrittlement of material due to an excessive hydrogen content. This made possible a fatigue fracture mechanism under normal operative cyclic loads...|$|R
2500|$|The 1933 Coupe Deutsch de la Meurthe was {{scheduled}} to start on 28 May and each aircraft {{had to make a}} flight at more than [...] over a [...] course in the period 8–14 May to participate.

50|$|The first XP-67, 42-11677, {{was ready}} for ground trials on 1 December 1943, {{although}} it was not yet ready for flight. The aircraft was fitted with XIV-1430-17/19 engines and General Electric D-23 turbo-superchargers. No pressurization equipment or armament would be installed in the prototype. On 8 December, the aircraft was damaged by fires in both engine nacelles, caused by a malfunction of the exhaust manifold slip rings. By 6 January 1944, the damage was repaired and the XP-67 made its first flight. The flight, however, ended after six minutes due to difficulties with the experimental engines. After a number of modifications were made to the engine installations, two test flights were carried out. On the fourth flight, the engine bearings burned out when the <b>engines</b> were unintentionally <b>overspeeded.</b>|$|R
50|$|The unarmed 'B' version {{had greater}} impact than the {{interceptor}} when the USSR sent two MiG-25R, and two MiG-25RB to Egypt in March 1971 and stayed until July 1972. They were {{operated by the}} Soviet 63rd Independent Air Detachment (Det 63), which was established for this mission. Det 63 flew over Israeli-held territory in Sinai on reconnaissance missions roughly 20 times. The flights were in pairs at maximum speed and high altitude (between 17,000-23,000 m). On 6 November 1971, a Soviet MiG-25 operating out of Egypt flying at Mach 2.5 was met by Israeli F-4Es and fired upon unsuccessfully. A MiG-25 was tracked flying over Sinai at Mach 3.2 during this period. The MiG-25 <b>engines</b> went into <b>overspeed,</b> which led to them being scrapped. Det 63 was sent back home in 1972.
