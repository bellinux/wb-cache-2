25|$|Drag-line {{excavation}} {{systems are}} heavy equipment used in civil engineering and surface mining. In civil engineering the smaller types {{are used for}} road and port construction. The larger types are used in strip-mining operations to move overburden above coal, and for tar-sand mining. A <b>drag</b> <b>line</b> bucket system consists of a large bucket which is suspended from a boom, a large truss-like structure, with wire ropes. The bucket is maneuvered {{by means of a}} number of ropes and chains. The hoist rope, powered by large diesel or electric motors, supports the bucket and hoist-coupler assembly from the boom. The drag rope is used to draw the bucket assembly horizontally. By skillful maneuvre of the hoist and the drag ropes the bucket is controlled for various operations. The dragline excavator was invented in 1904 by John W. Page.|$|E
50|$|The net is deployed, {{with one}} end {{attached}} to an anchored dan (marker) buoy, {{by the main}} vessel, the seiner, or by a smaller auxiliary boat. A <b>drag</b> <b>line</b> is paid out, followed by a net wing. As the seiner sweeps in a big circle returning to the buoy, the deployment continues with the seine bag and the remaining wing, finishing with the remaining <b>drag</b> <b>line.</b> In this way a large area can be surrounded. Next the drag lines are hauled in using rope-coiling machines until the catch bag can be secured.|$|E

40|$|Dragline {{operations}} support over $ 5 billion in Australia's export earnings per year. Variations in dragline operator performance have major maintenance and productivity implications for mines. Approximately $ 2 million per <b>drag</b> <b>line</b> per year {{could be saved}} by replacing operators who achieve below-average performance with operators who achieve higher productivity and lower damage costs, through better selection and training practices. Different <b>drag</b> <b>line</b> operators perform at different levels but {{there has never been}} a validated way of determining the performance capabilities of individuals. For many operator jobs, the next person-in-line is selected. To address these shortcomings, a field study was conducted that investigated whether psychomotor skills, personality or demographic factors can predict dragline performance. Perception, coordination, intelligence, personality and demographics were measured through a computer based testing program, called the Vienna Test System (VTS). Conscientiousness was assessed in terms of dependability, hardworking, achievement-orientation and perseverance through supervisor ratings. A total of 14 mines with 28 draglines allowed testing on their sites. These mines employ approximately 350 dragline operators out of an overall population of 800 in Australia. A total of 191 operators participated in testing, which took approximately 1. 5 hours each. Of the operators tested, 185 provided valid data sets, which included between 500 and 35, 000 cycles of actual operating data for each participant, from minesite monitors and the testing data. A new productivity measure was developed specifically for this study in order to overcome the confounding variables that undermine the reliability of existing measures. The test-retest reliability of the productivity measure showed correlation of 0. 96 compared with 0. 57 for previous measures. Two of the VTS tests, which take less than 30 minutes to administer, in conjunction with age, explain 64 percent of the variation in operator performance.

40|$|Dragline Swing to Dump Automation By Peter Corke, CSIRO Manufacturing Technology/CRC for Mining Technology and Equipment (CMTE) Peter Corke {{presented}} {{a case study}} of a project to automate the dragline swing to dump operation. The project is funded by ACARP, BHP Coal, Pacific Coal and the CMTE and is being carried out on a dragline at Pacific Coal's Meandu mine near Brisbane. Corke began by highlighting that the minerals industry makes extensive use of large, mechanised machines. However, unlike other industries, mining has not adopted automation and most machines are controlled by human operators on board the machine itself. Choosing an automation target The dragline automation was chosen because: ò draglines are one of the biggest capital assets in a mine; ò performance between operators vary significantly, so improved capital utilisation is possible; ò the dragline is often the bottleneck in production; ò {{a large part of the}} operation cycle is spent swinging from dig to dump; and ò it is technically feasible.

40|$|MSc (Occupational Hygiene), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Dust is a {{well-known}} occupational hygiene challenge and has been throughout the years, especially in the coal mining industry. The hazards arising from coal dust will differ between geographical areas due to the unique characteristics of dust from the coal mining environment. It is therefore of upmost importance to identify these qualities or characteristics of coal dust {{in order to understand}} the potential hazards it may pose. It is also important to consider the presence of nanoparticles which until recently remained neglected due to the absence of methods to study them. Aim: The aim of this study was to collect significant quantities of airborne dust through static sampling to characterise the physical, morphological as well as elemental properties of inhalable and respirable dust produced at two South African underground and two opencast coal mines. Personal exposure quantification was therefore not the primary concern in this study. Method: Static dust sampling was done at two mining areas of the two opencast and underground coal mines using four Institute of Occupational Medicine (IOM) and four cyclone samplers per area at each mine. A condensation particle counter (CPC) was also used at the opencast areas. The opencast areas included blast hole drilling, <b>drag</b> <b>line</b> and power shovel operations. The underground areas included the continuous miner and roof bolter operations. Gravimetric analyses of the cyclone and IOM samples were done as well as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis. Results: Mine A (opencast and underground) produces higher grade coal in comparison to mine B (opencast and underground). Gravimetric analysis indicated higher average inhalable (55. 35 mg/m 3) and respirable (2. 13 mg/m 3) concentrations of dust in the underground areas when compared to the opencast areas (34. 73 mg/m 3 and 0. 33 mg/m 3). Blast hole drilling operations indicated higher average inhalable and respirable dust concentrations (39. 02 mg/m 3 and 0. 41 mg/m 3) when compared to the <b>drag</b> <b>line</b> and power shovel operations (30. 44 mg/m 3 and 0. 246 mg/m 3). CPC results showed higher average concentrations of sub-micron particles at the blast hole drilling areas per cubic metre (63132 x 106) compared to the <b>drag</b> <b>line</b> and power shovel operations (38877 x 106). EDS analysis from the opencast areas indicated much higher concentrations of impurities (with lower concentrations of carbon – 33. 33 %) when compared to samples taken from the underground mining activities (65. 41 %). The EDS results from the opencast areas differed substantially. The highest concentrations of silica were found at the blast hole drilling areas. EDS results from the underground areas indicated that mine A has slightly higher concentrations of carbon (66. 2 %) with less impurities when compared to mine B (64. 62 %). The continuous miner operations showed a higher concentration of impurities when compared to the dust from the roof bolter. SEM results from the opencast areas revealed that the majority of particles are irregularly shaped and the presence of quartz and agglomerations are evident. SEM results from the underground areas were similar except that the roof bolter produced smaller sized particles when compared to the continuous miner. It also seemed that the areas with higher levels of impurities produced more sub-micron particles. Conclusions: It is possible to identify the majority of physical and elemental characteristics of coal dust by means of gravimetric analysis, particle counting, SEM and EDS. There were differences found, regarding the morphological; chemical and physical characteristics, between the different opencast and underground areas at mine A and mine B due to the type of mining activity and amount of overburden present. Silicosis, Pneumoconiosis and Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are some of the possible health concerns. It has been seen that dust from higher grade coal mines contributed to more developed stages of these diseases. Master...|$|E
