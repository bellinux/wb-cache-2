40|$|AbstractThis work aims at {{monitoring}} {{diesel engine}} {{fuel injection system}} by analyzing the cylinder head variations. It focuses on dual-peak phenomenon in combustion stage signal of cylinder head vibration under certain work condition. The first peak of dual-peak is the vibratory response signal of fuel <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> valve crash which is proved by the time domain analysis between cylinder head vibration and in-cylinder combustion pressure, analysis for cylinder head vibration of misfire and analysis of fuel feeding law change following engine rotational speed. The start time of the fuel <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> valve crash vibratory response signal can describe the fuel <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> valve closing timing. The acceleration peak of fuel <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> valve crash vibratory response signal can describe crash strength.

40|$|Modeling of fuel {{injection}} equipment is a tool that is used increasingly for explaining or predicting the effect of advanced diesel injection strategies on combustion and emissions. This paper reports on the modeling of the high-pressure part of a research type Heavy Duty Common Rail (CR) {{fuel injection}} system. More specifically, it reports on the observed dynamics of the injection system and the capability of the model to capture this. For that reason, the total high-pressure part of the injection system, i. e. the fuel pump, rail and injector, has been modeled using the AMESim code (Imagine S. A., 2004). The reliability of the resulting hydraulic model is tested through a comparison between numerical results and actual injection measurements. This detailed comparison is based on measurements of injected mass flow rate, needle lift and pressure oscillations in the injection duct {{for a series of}} single injection events. It is shown that the hydraulic model is able to accurately simulate the injection rate, needle lift and injection pressure for different rail pressure levels. For accurate numerical results, it is vital that the stiffness of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> assembly and the discharge coefficients of the different flow restrictions in the injector (e. g. nozzle holes) are correctly modeled. Assuming a rigid <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> results in a too early start of injection. Discharge coefficient values found in literature shows a wide spread. This makes it very difficult to simulate the injected mass flow rate accurately on the basis of literature data. Using the measured injected mass of fuel to tune the discharge coefficient, together with the inclusion of the elasticity of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle,</b> results in a good approximation of the injection rate...|$|E

The main objectives of the present studies were to further characterize the analgesic-like effects of intranigral morphine, to determine whether these effects were related to a general impairment of sensory or motor function, and to assess their anatomical specificity. The principal findings are: (1) intranigral morphine (10 μg) suppresses pain-related behavior without altering responses {{to a variety of}} non-noxious auditory, visual, and somatic stimuli, and without producing motor impairment; (2) movement of <b>injector</b> <b>needles</b> approximately 1 mm rostral, dorsal, or medial to the active nigral site significantly reduces the analgesic-like effect of morphine on the tail-flick test; and (3) electrolytic lesions confined to the nigra significantly reduced the analgesic-like effect of morphine on the hot-plate test.

The CRDi engine performance changes with the type of high-pressure electro-mechanical injector that is used and its injection response in a multi-injection scheme.

40|$|Highly pure {{metallic}} structures can be deposited by {{electron beam}} induced deposition {{and they have}} many important applications in different fields. The organo-metallic precursor is decomposed and deposited under the electron beam, and typically it is purified with post-irradiation in presence of O 2. However, this approach limits the purification {{to the surface of}} the deposit. Therefore, 'in situ' purification during deposition using simultaneous flows of both O 2 and precursor in parallel with two gas <b>injector</b> <b>needles</b> has been tested and verified. To simplify the practical arrangements, a special concentric nozzle has been designed allowing deposition and purification performed together in a single step. With this new device metallic structures with high purity can be obtained more easily, while there is no limit on the height of the structures within a practical time frame. In this work, we summarize the first results obtained for 'in situ' Au purification using this concentric nozzle, which is described in more detail, including flow simulations. The operational parameter space is explored in order to optimize the shape as well as the purity of the deposits, which are evaluated through scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy measurements, respectively.

40|$|Alinear optical {{displacement}} sensorwas {{designed to}} overcome the problems related to the sensitivity of traditional transducers to electromagnetic disturbance, when applied to the measurement of needle lift in electrically actuated Diesel fuel injectors. The sensor consisted of a laser light emitter, a receiver, and a device used for modulating {{the intensity of the}} light reaching the receiver in function of position of the moving element. Thus, two rectangular windows were mounted on the injector body, while a third window was rigidly connected to the needle control piston, and aligned with the fixed ones, to obtain a clearance area which varied linearly with needle position. An optical fibre cable was used to transfer the laser light from the source to one of the fixed window, while a similar cable was connected between the second window and the receiver. Hence, the intensity of the light reaching the receiver was proportional to the position of the <b>injector</b> <b>needle.</b> Light intensity was converted into an equivalent voltage, and this signal was fed to the data acquisition system. The <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> lift curves were measured and compared with those obtained with a commercial eddy current sensor.

For each surgically resected material, the cytological and histopathological findings of the internal aspirates from both the Chiba and injector needles as well as the smears from the external surfaces of these needles were compared. Results: Of the 70 biopsy materials obtained by the Chiba needle, malignancy was demonstrated in 58, benign lesions in one, while 11 were non-diagnostic. The results obtained with the <b>injector</b> <b>needle</b> revealed 58 malignancies, and 12, without any diagnosis. With both techniques, no false positive results were&nbsp;observed. The diagnostic sensitivity of the techniques was 84 % and 82 % for the Chiba and injector needles respectively.

40|$|An {{alarming}} {{number of}} compression ignition (CI) engines in the transport, mining and heavy engineering environments have been failing due to combustion irregularities within their combustion chambers. It {{has been found}} that diesel fuels containing contaminants or diesel fuels with poor lubricity characteristics lead to stickiness of diesel <b>injector</b> <b>needles,</b> which badly affects injector spray patterns resulting in the phenomenon of “cold combustion”. This study has been undertaken to develop a technique for detecting and preventing the damage resulting from this deviation in the combustion of a diesel engine. The technique has been formulated with a view to being as non intrusive as possible, so as not to require major modification of an existing test engine to accommodate the technique. The practice of monitoring individual cylinder exhaust gas temperatures (EGTs) proved to be an effective way of determining whether potentially destructive combustion abnormalities were taking place within the diesel engine. By recording these temperatures at certain stages during the engine’s operation, taking their average, and comparing each one to this average it is also possible to isolate the location of the combustion abnormality. This method proved to be most effective at full loads and maximum fuel delivery where combustion temperatures are highest and the effects of poor combustion are most noticeable and potentially damaging. The second goal was to develop a small, portable electronic device that makes use of the monitoring technique developed and provides a visual and audible alarm to notify a vehicle operator or technician of a combustion fault within a diesel engine. A Combustion Monitoring System (CMS) prototype was developed and tested on a small naturally aspirated engine at the University of Pretoria’s engine testing facilities. The prototype met its primary goal of detecting simulated combustion abnormalities under a variety of test conditions. It is envisaged that the monitoring techniques applied in developing the CMS unit may eventually be incorporated into the powerful processing abilities of the modern diesel Engine Control Unit (ECU). In its current form the CMS prototype is a useful tool in sensing combustion related malfunctions within a diesel engine and preventing damage from occurring.

The mouth may be closed via suturing with a needle and ligature, using an adhesive, or by setting a wire into the maxilla and mandible with a <b>needle</b> <b>injector,</b> a specialized device most commonly used in North America and unique to mortuary practice. Care is taken to make the expression look as relaxed and natural as possible, and ideally a recent photograph of the deceased while still living {{is used as a}} reference. The process of closing the mouth and eyes, shaving, etc. is collectively known as setting the features.|$|R
40|$|Flow rate {{imbalances}} {{among the}} nozzle holes {{are responsible for}} undesirable effects, as hole to hole differences, that worsen the regular fuel spray development. Multi hole injectors for common rail-equipped small diesel engines have been investigated by 3 D-CFD modeling, under ballistic needle motion; simulation campaigns have been devoted to highlight, on one side, how the actual nozzle layout influences the fuel flow pattern upstream the nozzles; on the other side, the role of actual operating conditions of the injector has been studied. Relating to geometrical layout, different factors define the actual injector tip features; here, the effects of specific details have been taken into account; in the modeling of the actual nozzle layout, the effects of hole key-shape, inlet edge radius and hole diameter have been investigated, pointing out their influence on the fuel flow development. Then, regarding the modeling of <b>injector</b> actual operation, <b>needle</b> eccentricity and <b>injector</b> axis inclination have been considered, as well. Once the modeling details have been described, the fuel flow features are shown and discussed, both for VCO and Micro-Sac nozzle types, addressing {{the role of the}} different driving factors on the flow development...|$|R
