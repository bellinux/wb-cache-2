40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{for the first time}} an {{approach}} for hardware accelerated displacement mapping. The displaced surface is generated from a 2 D displacement map by remeshing a coarse triangle mesh according to the screen projection of the surface. The remeshing algorithm is implemented in hardware. <b>Filtered</b> <b>access</b> to the displacement map makes our approach competitive with available view dependent multiresolution techniques. The advantage of displacement mapping is the compact representation. A displacement mapped surface consumes together with all filter levels {{only a fraction of the}} storage space needed for a hardware compatible representation of an equivalent triangle mesh. A possible design of the displacement mapping rendering pipeline is proposed. Previously described hardware components are used as often as possible. Our approach can be smoothly integrated into all available graphics application programming interfaces.

Aberystwyth: Department of Information Studies, University of Wales Aberystwyth. Sponsorship: National Library for Health (NLH) Executive summary The aim was {{to provide}} an {{overview}} of the status of the Specialist Libraries around 12 months after the commissioning exercise of March 2003 that saw the creation of new Specialist Libraries, as well as the continuation of some that had been established for some years prior to 2003. The objectives were to answer the following questions: ? Are the Specialist Libraries operating as intended? Are their differing management structures working well? ? How are they acting as communities of practice? ? How can their stage of development be assessed? ? How is the community of information specialists operating to support the development of the Specialist Libraries? ? What are the Specialist Libraries? links with other organisations, such as professional associations and patient groups? Operation and management of the Specialist Libraries Structures are different but they work. Many Libraries see the need to reward contributors? efforts through CPD points or payment. The RMS is working, and most Specialist Libraries appreciate the benefits of the links between the libraries, the ability to make use of RSS feeds, but the drawback is the difficulty in providing training and learning materials. Technical support has improved. Information specialists are taking on greater responsibilities for ensuring that their editorial boards, reference groups, and advisory groups are kept informed of developments. There is some uncertainty about the fit between the Specialist Libraries, and other national knowledge activities, particularly the Map of Medicine. Specialist Libraries as communities of practice Some Specialist Libraries wish to foster their' active' stage of development and move towards the 'engaged'stage by: ? developing interaction with their communities online discussion forums, or question and answering services ? providing more learning activities and materials. The evidence from the recent literature suggests that the Specialist Libraries will need to focus on: ? dealing with differences between the professions represented in their communities on the way innovations are handled. ? integrating primary care, and providing services that primary care appreciate (such as the question and answering services) Specialist Libraries may need to debate how to: ? support learning, and link into existing CPD activities (such as journal clubs) ? provide <b>filtered</b> <b>access,</b> to people with the knowhow about service improvement, for their specialist area...|$|E

Using a decomposition of execution time, we show that for modern processors that employ aggressive memory latency tolerance techniques, wasted cycles due to insufficient bandwidth generally exceed those due to raw memory latencies. Given the importance of maximizing memory bandwidth, we calculate effective pin bandwidth, then estimate optimal effective pin bandwidth. We measure these quantities by determining the amount by which both caches and minimal -traffic caches <b>filter</b> <b>accesses</b> to the lower levels of the memory hierarchy. We see that there is a gap that can exceed two orders of magnitude between the total memory traffic generated by caches and the minimal-traffic caches [...] -implying that the potential exists to increase effective pin bandwidth [...] ...|$|R
