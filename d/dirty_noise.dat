5000|$|Dope Body {{has been}} {{described}} as [...] "a speedball of <b>dirty</b> <b>noise</b> rock and radio friendly alt. rock" [...] and compared to Rage Against The Machine and Brainiac.|$|E
5000|$|Originally {{written for}} an aborted Ziggy Stardust musical in late 1973, [...] "Rebel Rebel" [...] - {{completed}} in January 1974 and released {{the following month}} - was Bowie's last single in the glam rock style that had been his trademark. It was also his first hit since 1969 not to feature lead guitarist Mick Ronson; Bowie himself played guitar on this and almost all other tracks from Diamond Dogs, producing what NME critics Roy Carr and Charles Shaar Murray called [...] "a rocking <b>dirty</b> <b>noise</b> that owed as much to Keith Richards as it did to the departed Ronno".|$|E
5000|$|The band {{released}} {{their debut}} full-length album Known Flood on February 19, 2013 through Sacrament, an imprint owned by {{staff at the}} Saint Vitus bar. The album {{has been described as}} [...] "pristine post-rock with <b>dirty</b> <b>noise</b> and hardcore, and it wouldn't be wrong to affix the word [...] "blackened" [...] to the overall sound." [...] Pitchfork's Grayson Currin gave the album a positive review, writing that [...] "each of the longer numbers roll several themes and transitions into a relatively compact framework, again avoiding boredom by a bustle of activity. “Slow Ruin,” one of two that makes it past seven minutes, volleys from field recordings to Touch and Go throb, from post-millennial blackened grandeur to an expansive noise fadeaway." [...] On October 14 they released a music video for the track 'Slow Ruin' directed by Aj Annunziata. On November 12 they released a two-track EP 'Lions Eye', described as funneling [...] "both brawn and versatility into likably finite spaces." ...|$|E
40|$|A {{secondary}} {{analysis of}} data from a national survey {{was carried out in}} order to assess the number of industrial workers exposed to noise and other adverse working conditions. This permitted us to study correlations with parameters of health. More than half of the male blue collar workers in industry and building trades (sample n = 311) reported a great deal of <b>noise.</b> <b>Dirty</b> work and strenuous physical activity were also frequently mentioned. Noise exposure is often present together with exposure to stench and dirty and dangerous work. A weak correlation exists between reported noise exposure and experienced ill-being and diminished satisfaction with their own health. This observed relationship probably underestimates the true risk...|$|R
40|$|In these days, many {{organizations}} {{tend to use}} a Data Warehouse {{to meet the requirements}} to develop decisionmaking processes and achieve their goals better and satisfy their customers. It enables Executives to access the information they need in a timely manner for making the right decision for any work. Decision Support System (DSS) is one of the means that applied in data mining. Its robust and better decision depends on an important and conclusive factor called Data Quality (DQ), to obtain a high data quality using Data Scrubbing (DS) which is one of data Extraction Transformation and Loading (ETL) tools. Data Scrubbing is very important and necessary in the Data Warehouse (DW). There are growing relationships to get high DQ and effective DS. The use of DS algorithms is a solution to the constraints that limit the DQ which leads to weak decisions and the burden of the high financial costs. These constraints are: <b>dirty</b> data, <b>noise</b> data, missing values, inconsistency, uncertain data, ambiguous, conflicting, duplicated records and similar columns. The Sources and causes of these constraints are many, including: input error, merge data from different sources, difference in representing the same information, etc. In addition there are more than 35 sources and causes of the poor-quality data that arise at the stage of the ETL process. This paper present comparison and analysis for DS algorithms and {{the pros and cons of}} each algorithm, accuracy and time complexity. Additionally, it present a comparative and analysis of the Data Scrubbing Frameworks and determine the best framework...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we have {{presented}} an experimental performance evaluation of spatial IA in the 3 -user MIMO-OFDM interference channel and considering an static indoor wireless {{local area network}} scenario. We have carefully analyzed the main practical impairments that may degrade the end-to-end performance: imperfect CSI, frame detection in asynchronous scenarios, and dirty RF effects. To this end, we have deployed a suitable experimental setup made up of three MIMO transmitters and receivers and measured received constellation EVM and BER for a set of indoor channels following the conventional frame structure and synchronization strategies of the IEEE 802.11 a WLAN standard. We have firstly pointed out that time-domain IA decoding must be applied in totally asynchronous scenarios to cancel out the interference before time synchronization, and we have proposed a simple design for such decoders. Our results indicate that the EVM degradation due to time-domain IA decoding is less than 1 dB when choosing an appropriate decoder length. Secondly, an analysis of imperfect CSI has been carried out and we have observed that the received EVM is dominated by transmitter <b>noise</b> (<b>dirty</b> RF) when the channel estimates are sufficiently accurate, which significantly limits the end-to-end performance of IA. The performance of IA has also been compared with that of different TDMA schemes, and we have shown that IA may achieve a significantly higher throughput for a given BER requirement under real settings. Finally, this work highlights the relevance of experiments where signals are actually transmitted over the air and all practical impairments are taken into account. This experimental research is not only useful to evaluate theoretical results in real-world scenarios but also to uncover new research lines.|$|R
