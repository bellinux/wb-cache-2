5|$|In Fischer v. United States (2000), the Court {{held that}} the {{jurisdictional}} requirement of $10,000 in federal funds can be satisfied by any funds that flow through the organization, for example Medicaid reimbursements which a hospital receives indirectly through the patients. The only requirement is that the funds be traced to a statutory appropriation, and that their receipt be in <b>furtherance</b> of a federal policy.|$|E
5|$|One of Booker's first {{priorities}} was {{to reduce the}} city's crime rate. In <b>furtherance</b> of this, he appointed Garry McCarthy, former deputy commissioner of operations of the New York City Police Department, {{as director of the}} Newark Police Department. Crime reduction was such a central concern to the Booker administration that Booker, along with his security team, was known to personally patrol the streets of Newark until as late as 4a.m.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, enthusiasts for Delius's music who {{had gone}} to Bradford for the centenary festival formed the Delius Society; Fenby became its first president. With around 400 members, the Society is {{independent}} from the Trust, but works closely with it. Its general objectives are the <b>furtherance</b> of knowledge of Delius's life and works, and the encouragement of performances and recordings. In 2004, as a stimulus for young musicians to study and perform Delius's music, the Society established an annual Delius Prize competition, with a prize of £1,000 to the winner. In June 1984, at the Grand Theatre, Leeds, the Delius Trust sponsored a commemorative production of A Village Romeo and Juliet by Opera North, to mark the 50th anniversary of Delius's death.|$|E
5|$|Articles 41–43 mandate the State to {{endeavour}} to secure to all citizens the right to work, a living wage, social security, maternity relief, and a decent standard of living. These provisions aim at establishing a socialist state as envisaged in the Preamble. Article 43 also places upon the State the responsibility of promoting cottage industries, {{and the federal government}} has, in <b>furtherance</b> of this, established several Boards for the promotion of khadi, handlooms etc., in coordination with the state governments. Article 39A requires the State to provide free legal aid to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are available to all citizens irrespective of economic or other disabilities. Article 43A mandates the State to work towards securing the participation of workers in the management of industries. The State, under Article 46, is also mandated to promote the interests of and work for the economic uplift of the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes and protect them from discrimination and exploitation. Several enactments, including two Constitutional amendments, have been passed to give effect to this provision.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005, {{three men}} {{carrying}} guns {{broke into his}} home, removing any valuables. They {{asked if he was}} gay, and when he refused to respond they kidnapped him, later shooting him dead and dumping the body elsewhere. The police subsequently arrested four individuals and charged them with murder in the <b>furtherance</b> of a robbery. The accused remained in police custody for almost ten years before the case came to court. At that point, the police dropped their murder charges against two of the accused. The other two, Dwayne Owen and Andre West, went on trial and were found unanimously guilty of murder by a jury. Although prosecutors had requested capital punishment in the case, the judge sentenced them to life in prison with a minimum of thirty years before becoming eligible for parole.|$|E
5|$|James Baird Weaver (June 12, 1833– February 6, 1912) was {{a member}} of the United States House of Representatives and two-time {{candidate}} for President of the United States. Born in Ohio, he moved to Iowa as a boy when his family claimed a homestead on the frontier. He became politically active as a young man and was an advocate for farmers and laborers. He joined and quit several political parties in the <b>furtherance</b> of the progressive causes in which he believed. After serving in the Union Army in the American Civil War, Weaver returned to Iowa and worked for the election of Republican candidates. After several unsuccessful attempts at Republican nominations to various offices, and growing dissatisfied with the conservative wing of the party, in 1877 Weaver switched to the Greenback Party, which supported increasing the money supply and regulating big business. As a Greenbacker with Democratic support, Weaver won election to the House in 1878.|$|E

5|$|William left England {{towards the}} end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the {{continent}} he married his daughter Constance to Alan Fergant, the Duke of Brittany, in <b>furtherance</b> of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king Philip I, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle. He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the De Obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, {{has been shown to be}} a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.|$|E

25|$|In the 1860s, Clark became {{active in}} the UK branch of the Freedman's Aid Society which sought to assist former slaves in {{establishing}} basic yet comfortable homes.

After his death the yeshiva was renamed as Yeshivas Kol Yaakov Yehudah - Hadar Hatorah Rabbinical Seminary in recognition of his efforts.|$|E
25|$|The 1868 {{legislature}} banned former Confederates {{and passed}} a more wide-ranging law detailing funding and administrative issues and allowing Black children to attend school. In <b>furtherance</b> of this, the postwar 1868 state constitution {{was the first}} to permit a personal-property tax to fund the lands and buildings for public schools. With the 1868 elections, the first county school commissioners took office.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton voiced {{support for}} the {{establishment}} of a Palestinian state—a solution not endorsed by prime minister-designate Benjamin Netanyahu, with whom she had earlier pledged the United States' cooperation.

25|$|With all {{its past}} and present works being {{continuously}} provided on the internet, the commission has also provided a firm assistance to legal research in the country.

25|$|The {{aims of the}} CFSP are {{to promote}} both the EU's own {{interests}} {{and those of the}} international community as a whole, including the <b>furtherance</b> of international co-operation, respect for human rights, democracy, and the rule of law. The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue. The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq.|$|E
25|$|The 1934 defeat {{was less}} cataclysmic in the North, {{in that the}} strike was in fact, a number of {{separate}} events, commencing at different times in separate industries and in <b>furtherance</b> of local goals. Northern employers were not as ruthless in blacklisting workers and the TWOC made some headway in organizing these plants {{in the years that}} followed. Those victories were impermanent, however, as much of northern industry either went South or went bankrupt in the years that followed.|$|E
25|$|In 1167, Diarmait Mac Murchada, the deposed King of Leinster, {{failed in}} an attempt to take Waterford. He {{returned}} in 1170 with Cambro-Norman mercenaries under Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke (known as Strongbow); together they besieged and took the city after a desperate defence. In <b>furtherance</b> of the Norman invasion of Ireland, King Henry II of England landed at Waterford in 1171. Waterford and then Dublin were declared royal cities, with Dublin also declared capital of Ireland.|$|E
25|$|In the Judgement, Supreme {{court of}} India in 2004, said that {{teaching}} of 'Jyotir Vigyan' can {{under no circumstances}} be equated with teaching of any particular religion.

25|$|Khalid Sheikh Mohammed {{as well as}} Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Mustafa Ahmad al-Hawsawi, Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali and Walid Bin Attash have {{reportedly}} {{been charged}} {{with the murder of}} almost 3000 people, terrorism and providing material support for terrorism and plane hijacking; as well as attacking civilian objects, intentionally causing serious bodily injury and destruction of property in violation of the law of war.

25|$|With {{the passage}} of the National Defense Act, June 4, 1920 (Public Law 66-242, 41 Stat. 759-88), the Air Service was statutorily {{recognized}} as a combatant arm of the line along with the Infantry, Cavalry, Field Artillery, Coast Artillery, Corps of Engineers, and Signal Corps, and given a permanent organization with a fixed complement of personnel.

UCLG took responsibility for creating Agenda 21 for culture, a program for cultural policies promoting sustainable development, and has organized various conferences and reports for its <b>furtherance.</b>|$|E
25|$|In March 1989 the Court {{handed down}} its ruling. By a narrow margin, it {{held for the}} {{government}} on both questions, that the title applications were mailings in <b>furtherance</b> of Schmuck's scheme {{and that he was}} not entitled to an instruction on odometer tampering. Harry Blackmun wrote the majority opinion, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Byron White, John Paul Stevens, and Anthony Kennedy. Scalia wrote for himself and the other three dissenters, William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, and Sandra Day O'Connor. His opinion exclusively concerned the first question and did not reach the second.|$|E
25|$|The National Security Division {{monitors}} {{the conduct of}} field enforcement operations in the investigation, detection, interdiction, prosecution, and removal of foreign-born terrorists, terrorist supporters, and hostile foreign intelligence agents located within the United States.

25|$|Postmaster General Walter Folger Brown {{sought to}} improve the {{efficiency}} of the air mail carriers in <b>furtherance</b> of a national transportation plan. Requiring an informed intermediary, Brown asked MacCracken to preside over what was later scandalized as the Spoils Conferences, to work out an agreement between the carriers and the Post office to consolidate air mail routes into transcontinental networks operated by the best-equipped and financially stable companies. This relationship left both exposed to charges of favoritism. When MacCracken refused later to testify before the Senate, he was found in contempt of Congress.|$|E
25|$|Peel did {{retain a}} hard core of {{supporters}} however, known as Peelites, {{and at one}} point in 1849 was actively courted by the Whig/Radical coalition. He continued to stand on his conservative principles, however, and refused. Nevertheless, he was influential on several important issues, including the <b>furtherance</b> of British free trade with the repeal of the Navigation Acts. Peel {{was a member of the}} committee which controlled the House of Commons Library, and on 16 April 1850 was responsible for passing the motion that controlled its scope and collection policy for the rest of the century.|$|E
25|$|In 1931, a {{committee}} {{was established in}} the yeshiva for the <b>furtherance</b> of Jewish education. The committee's goal was to ensure that traditional Jewish education was available to as many Jewish children as possible. The committee saw the organization of schools in small towns where there had previously been little or no structured system of schooling. Older students in the yeshiva were selected to teach for periods of time at these schools, following which, they would return to continue their studies at the yeshiva. In addition to providing many communities at large with new educational options, these schools also gave Telzer students another opportunity for self-development and growth.|$|E
