5|$|Tony Iommi {{has been}} {{credited}} as the pioneer of lighter gauge guitar strings. The tips of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> severed in a steel factory, and while using thimbles (artificial finger tips) {{he found that}} standard guitar strings were too difficult to bend and play. He {{found that there was}} only one size of strings available, so after years with Sabbath he had strings custom made.|$|E
25|$|He was a {{man with}} fair skin, thin, emaciated, with a sparse beard, a {{slightly}} hunched frame, sunken eyes and protruding forehead, and the bases of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> hairless.|$|E
25|$|Talhah {{distinguished}} {{himself at}} the Battle of Uhud by keeping close to Muhammad {{while most of the}} Muslim army fled. He protected Muhammad's face from an arrow by taking the shot in his own hand, as a result of which two of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> paralysed. He was also hit twice in the head, and it was said that he suffered a total of 75 wounds in the battle.|$|E
60|$|She did not {{withdraw}} her hand. Its pressure upon <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>was</b> faint but insistent.|$|R
5000|$|Ooh! - A kid goes to {{an actual}} petting zoo, {{but when he}} pets a baby tiger, <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> bitten off.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} her that his frame had become tenser, his tone harder. The grip of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>was</b> still upon her wrist.|$|R
25|$|The Hebron Yeshiva, {{a branch}} of the famed Slobodka yeshiva, was also {{attacked}} during the riots. On Friday, 23 August, an Arab crowd gathered outside it and threw stones through the windows. Only two people were inside, a student and the sexton. The student was grabbed by the Arab crowd, who stabbed him to death; the sexton survived by hiding in a well. The next day, a crowd armed with staves and axes attacked and killed two Jewish boys, one stoned to death and the other stabbed. More than 70 Jews, including the Yeshiva students, sought refuge in the house of Eliezer Dan Slonim, the son of the Rabbi of Hebron, but were massacred by an Arab mob. Survivors and reporters recounted the carnage that occurred at the Slonim residence. Moses Harbater, an 18-year-old was stabbed and two of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> severed. He described at a later trial of some Arab rioters how a fellow student had been mutilated and killed. Forty-two teachers and students were murdered at the yeshiva.|$|E
500|$|O'Brien {{narrowly}} {{missed a}} {{medal in the}} 4 100m medley relay. Along with Michael Wenden, Robert Cusack and Karl Byrom, the Australian quartet won their heat and entered the final as the equal fifth fastest qualifier. In the final, O'Brien swam his leg in 1min 8.6s, which was only the fifth fastest breaststroke leg. Australia were fourth {{at the end of}} each leg, except O'Brien's, when they were third. Australia eventually missed out on the bronze by 0.1s to the Soviet Union. O'Brien admitted that his training had been insufficient for Olympic standards, noting that [...] "I needed to put on another thousand kilometres in training". O'Brien also rued the absence of Talbot to motivate him to work, and had a further accident at the Olympic Village when <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> slammed by a closing window. Under competition regulations, he was not allowed to bind his hand during competition.|$|E
500|$|After the 1910 cricket season, Fender {{worked in}} a paper mill in Horwich, Lancashire, to {{experience}} paper manufacturing—his father's line of business—at first hand. While feeding paper into a machine, his left hand was trapped in the mechanism and injured. Three of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> crushed at the tips; upon healing, they remained stiff and numb {{for the rest of}} his life. Fender remained in Horwich at the start of the 1911 cricket season and played several times for Manchester Cricket Club. He was on the verge of selection for Lancashire when he had to return to Brighton. That season he played twice for Sussex; the following year, in his second match for the county, he scored his maiden first-class century, against Oxford University. He followed this by taking five for 42 (five wickets taken and 42 runs conceded) against Surrey. After these successes, Fender played [...] regularly for the remainder of the 1912 season. In total, he scored 606 runs at an average of 24.24, and, bowling medium pace, took 16 wickets at an average of 25.50.|$|E
60|$|He {{thought he}} saw a {{fluttering}} assent in the dimming eyes. The pulse under <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>was</b> as fine and small as a silk thread.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} known that no real person would be {{wandering}} about the castle at night, and a ghost couldn't carry anything, for <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> all smoke." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Al-ways rusty! <b>His</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>is</b> al-ways rusty!" [...] muttered young Jerry. [...] "Where does {{my father}} {{get all that}} iron rust from? He don't get no iron rust here!" ...|$|R
500|$|After the riff, {{the verse}} {{sections}} begin, which Shadwick describe as [...] "simplicity itself, consisting of just three chords": E79, G, and A. [...] The E79, or dominant seventh sharp ninth chord, {{has come to}} be called the [...] "Hendrix chord" [...] by guitarists and was used primarily in rhythm and blues and jazz before Hendrix helped popularize it. [...] He also used an unconventional fingering technique for the G and A chords. [...] Because Hendrix used his thumb to fret the roots of the G and A chords on the sixth string, <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> left in a position to create different chord voicings. [...] Instead of the usual G barre chord (G–B–G–B–D–G), a G5 (G–X–G–G–D–G) is sometimes played with the major third (B) being muted on the fifth string and replaced by the open third string (G). [...] Redding follows the chord changes mostly by playing the root with occasional passing notes, while Mitchell heightens the tension with drum flourishes that accentuate Hendrix's vocal and guitar.|$|E
2500|$|The {{folk song}} {{mentioned}} above {{has a few}} particulars on his physical appearance; he was described as [...] "rather old," [...] two of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> crooked, {{and he had a}} long scar on his chin.|$|E
2500|$|McGuire {{played before}} the advent of most modern {{protective}} equipment, and <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> reportedly [...] "gnarled, broken, bent, split and crooked" [...] {{by the end of his}} career. [...] One account, published in 1901, emphasized the physical beating:"A picture of McGuire's hands would be an interesting and wonderful exhibit. [...] The maimed and misshapen members which he will carry with him after he quits the game and to the grave are mute reminders of many a foul ticked off the bat, a wild thrown ball stopped with the finger tips after a leap into the air, or a low one clawed up out of the roots of the plate, and an occasional one caught full on the end of a digit, splitting the flesh and nail." ...|$|E
60|$|ANNA--Yes, I {{certainly}} do! He's {{a regular}} man, {{no matter what}} faults he's got. One of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>is</b> worth all the hundreds of men I met out there--inland.|$|R
500|$|Grampu (performed by Tyler Bunch) is Oobi and Uma's grandfather. His {{appearance}} {{is different from}} that of the children; four of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> curled instead of being extended. His catchphrase is [...] "Lovely!" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> {{upon the}} bell, when his servant entered, bearing a note upon a salver. Matravers {{glanced at the}} {{handwriting}} already becoming familiar to him, recognizing, too, the faint odour of violets which seemed to escape into the room as <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> broke the seal.|$|R
2500|$|Barihun {{joined his}} family in Israel on 1999, leaving behind his ex-wife and their son Nahum. His dream - being a {{musician}} in Israel - has proven difficult to realize. Facing a language barrier and the burden of alimony, Barihun worked as a dishwasher in a restaurant through the day and as a night security guard. <b>His</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> burned by dishwashing detergents, hindering his practice with his saxophones. He was discovered by Moshe Bar-Yuda, then head of the TOMER NGO, and formerly (1957) {{one of the first}} Israeli emissaries to Beta Israel communities. Bar Yuda brought Barihun together with musicologist Shlomo Israeli, who was deeply touched by Barihun's playing. Israeli paired Barihun with jazz pianist Yitzhak Yedid, a successful match that gave rise to the [...] "Ras Deshen Ensemble".|$|E
2500|$|Tatum played chords with a {{relatively}} flat-fingered technique compared to the curvature taught in classical training. [...] Composer/pianist Mary Lou Williams told Whitney Balliett, [...] "Tatum {{taught me how to}} hit my notes, how to control them without using pedals. And he showed me how to keep my fingers flat on the keys to get that clean tone." [...] Jimmy Rowles said, [...] "Most of the stuff he played was clear over my head. [...] There was too much going on—both hands were impossible to believe. [...] You couldn't pick out what he was doing because <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> so smooth and soft, and the way he did it—it was like camouflage." [...] When his fastest tracks of [...] "Tiger Rag" [...] are slowed down, they still reveal a coherent, syncopated rhythm.|$|E
2500|$|Part of {{the problem}} {{might have been the}} sheer size of Rubinstein's hands. They were huge, and many {{observers}} commented on them. Josef Hofmann observed that Rubinstein's fifth finger [...] "was as thick as my thumb—think of it! [...] Then <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> square at the ends, with cushions on them. [...] It was a wonderful hand." [...] Pianist Josef Lhevinne described them as [...] "fat, pudgy ... with fingers so broad at the finger-tips that he often had difficulty in not striking two notes at once." [...] The German piano teacher Ludwig Deppe advised American pianist Amy Fay to watch carefully how Rubinstein struck his chords: [...] "Nothing cramped about him! [...] He spreads his hands as if he were going to take in the universe, and takes them up with the greatest freedom and abandon!" ...|$|E
5|$|While a {{high school}} student working {{part-time}} at an Arby's restaurant, Emanuel severely cut <b>his</b> right middle <b>finger</b> on a meat slicer, which was later infected from swimming in Lake Michigan. <b>His</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> partially amputated due to the severity of the infection.|$|R
60|$|Jan {{turns to}} look on the {{prisoner}} and encounters his mocking glance. Smothering a curse he resumes his task of adjusting the rope upon the gibbet, but <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> unsteady and <b>his</b> work doth not progress.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ran away, a negro {{man named}} Ned. Three of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>are</b> {{drawn into the}} palm of his hand by a cut. Has a scar on the back of his neck, nearly half round, done by a knife.' ...|$|R
2500|$|Van Vliet {{wanted the}} whole band to [...] "live" [...] the Trout Mask Replica album. The group rehearsed Van Vliet's {{difficult}} compositions for eight months, living communally in their small rented {{house in the}} Woodland Hills suburb of Los Angeles. With only two bedrooms the band members would find sleep in various corners of one, while Vliet occupied the other and rehearsals were accomplished in the main living area. Van Vliet implemented his vision by completely dominating his musicians, artistically and emotionally. At various times {{one or another of}} the group members was [...] "put in the barrel", with Van Vliet berating him continually, sometimes for days, until the musician collapsed in tears or in total submission. Guitarist Bill Harkleroad complained that <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> a [...] "bloody mess" [...] as a result of Beefheart's orders that he use heavy strings. Drummer John French described the situation as [...] "cultlike" [...] and a visiting friend said [...] "the environment in that house was positively Mansonesque". Their material circumstances were dire. With no income other than welfare and contributions from relatives, the group barely survived and were even arrested for shoplifting food (Zappa bailed them out). French has recalled living on no more than a small cup of beans a day for a month. A visitor described their appearance as [...] "cadaverous" [...] and said that [...] "they all looked in poor health". Band members were restricted from leaving the house and practiced for 14 or more hours a day.|$|E
60|$|He bowed, {{and already}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> on the handle. Suddenly {{she called to}} him.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin lit a cigarette. <b>His</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> quite steady, {{but this}} man was making him think.|$|E
6000|$|Mechanically she obeyed; {{mechanically}} {{she looked}} down where <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> pointing. It was the convict Monbrun--there, just visible under the bright light of the candle, were the fatal letters [...] "T. F." [...] branded on the villain's shoulder! ...|$|R
60|$|Wrayson stopped smoking. The {{cigarette}} burned unheeded between <b>his</b> <b>fingers.</b> <b>His</b> eyes <b>were</b> fixed {{upon his}} visitor.|$|R
60|$|When {{the first}} {{splashes}} of rain arrived Saxon was delighted. Billy betrayed little interest. <b>His</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> hurting too much, he said. Neither he nor Saxon could make anything of it, and both {{scoffed at the}} idea of a felon.|$|R
60|$|Laverick {{looked at}} the boy. <b>His</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> trembling, but it was with relief. The note was from Morrison.|$|E
60|$|Dominey {{admitted}} {{defeat and}} poured himself out some more coffee. Neither {{of the two}} noticed that <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> trembling.|$|E
60|$|He {{put forth}} a hand to touch her arm, and she drew it back as if <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>were</b> of fire.|$|E
60|$|This {{unexpected}} rebellion of {{the worm}} {{which he had}} so often twisted round <b>his</b> <b>finger</b> <b>was</b> too much for Ujarak in his then irascible condition. He flew into a violent rage, grasped the handle of his knife, and glared fiercely at his pupil.|$|R
60|$|Burton {{was already}} {{holding it in}} <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> and <b>was</b> gazing at it lovingly.|$|R
25|$|One of <b>his</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>is</b> missing as a result, {{he said in}} a 2014 interview, to a home-made bomb {{blowing up}} in his hand. He says that the missing finger makes him a terrible photographer, {{although}} in 2013 he won the Hasselblad International Award in Photography.|$|R
