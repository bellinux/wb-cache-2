500|$|Muntz {{developed}} a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17tubes. He often carried {{a pair of}} wire clippers, and when he thought {{that one of his}} employees was [...] "overengineering" [...] a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would tell the engineer [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to put that last part back in" [...] and walk away.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{girl you}} ought to have married!" [...] Sadie exclaimed. [...] "What's she like? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> her picture, though you haven't shown it me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's your {{trouble that}} you're a confiding man. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{learned that it}} doesn't pay to take any chances when you deal with Mappin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{you will}} {{understand}} in a minute," [...] returned the rug dealer, blandly. He raised his voice. [...] "Boys, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better come in now!" ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young lady}} gave no heed to this announcement, but looked {{straight}} at her brother. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better be quiet," [...] she simply observed.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} nearer, certainly," [...] said Bartley. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better make it thirty." [...] He kept a quiet face, {{but his heart}} throbbed.|$|R
6000|$|Eliz. Ah! now <b>I</b> <b>guess.</b> <b>You</b> <b>have</b> some trinket for me-- You promised late to buy no {{more such}} baubles-- And {{now you are}} ashamed.--Nay, I must see-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, well, {{they will}} turn their faces to-morrow, Denis; {{and as for}} the weather, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got wet before now digging praties in the old country." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “No,” said Clay. “Your partner’s {{pretty smart}} and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got it safely {{locked up in}} one of the Island ports. The chances are that you won’t be able to give it to me.” ...|$|E
6000|$|The American {{tilted back}} {{his chair and}} poised it an instant. “Well, I’m sorry you want to attack one of our institutions. But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better enjoy {{yourself}} first!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{they knew}} we were {{following}} them," [...] explained Dave. [...] "Link, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better admit that the game is up," [...] he went on, turning to his former schoolmate.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good gracious!" [...] she exclaimed. [...] "Seven! <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to pay {{for extra}} baggage. Shall I get you a carriage, {{and where do you}} want to be driven to--to your own house or the hotel?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Saxton made {{a little}} {{impatient}} gesture. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got to learn, {{and there are plenty}} of men to be hired in the bush who do. You know how to rough down redwood logs and blow out rocks?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Devine nodded tranquilly. [...] "Allonby {{has enough}} for two, but he lets up and loses his grip when the whisky comes along," [...] he said. [...] "Still, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> got {{something}} that's worth rather more to me. You couldn't help having it. It {{was born in}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. I'm getting right there. The snow's melting tolerably fast, and the {{drainage}} {{from the big}} peak isn't going {{the way it used}} to now. The foot of the valley's quite a nice-sized lake, and the stream has washed most of the broke-up pines the snow brought down into the outlet gully. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen a bad lumber jam?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. All he said was, 'If {{you will}} join with me we can pay Dave Porter off good {{and get him}} in the biggest kind of a hole.' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better keep your eyes open, Dave." ...|$|R
6000|$|The American {{tilted back}} his chair {{a little and}} poised it an instant. [...] "Well, I'm sorry you want to attack one of our institutions," [...] he said, smiling. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better enjoy {{yourself}} FIRST!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a {{right to}} feel bitter, Uncle Lester," [...] {{returned}} Phil, who could realize how his relative had suffered. [...] "But it's all past now, and you must give up your life here and come home with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wannop's straight, {{but he and}} {{his friends}} are little men," [...] he said at length. [...] "You'd have the Hogarth Combine right on to you in London. One or two of their {{subsidiary}} concerns are registered there. Now, I don't know whether they really want your mine, but supposing they do, and you won't sell out to them, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> some idea of what their game would be?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, no," [...] Flett {{answered}} dryly. [...] "As <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> heard, {{they have}} had trouble of this kind in Alberta for a while; and most every time the boys were able to send back any American mavericks and beef-cattle that were run into Canada. As the result of it, our chiefs at Regina are pretty good friends with the sheriffs and deputies on the other side. They're generally willing to help us where they can." ...|$|E
60|$|We {{all know}} that, yet {{most of us}} are just foolish enough to make such a wish now and then. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> done it. I know I have. Peter Rabbit has done it often and then laughed at himself afterwards. I suspect that even shrewd, clever old Granny Fox has been guilty of it more than once. So it is not {{surprising}} that Reddy Fox, terribly hungry as he was, should do a little foolish wishing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "it sounds quite probable; {{but there}} are discrepancies. I'll take these things along, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better make for the {{homestead}} {{and ask them to}} let <b>you</b> in. We'll <b>have</b> a lively blizzard down on us very soon." ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{young girl}} glanced {{over the front}} of her dress and {{smoothed}} out a knot or two of ribbon. Then she rested her eyes upon the prospect again. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better leave it somewhere," [...] she said after a moment.|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{been too}} darned close {{about the whole}} business," [...] Julius accused him. [...] "You let on {{to me that you}} were off to the Argentine--though <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> your reasons for that. The idea of both you and Tuppence casting me for the part of Mr. Brown just tickles me to death!" ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{have not}} heard from you since the shout you gave when you set out from the station on your way home <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not {{received}} some seven or eight letters from me, and hence your silence. The mails are so unreliable that they may all have been lost. If you don't get this you had better send to Washington {{and get them to}} look over the dead letter office for the others. I have nothing to tell you of any interest, except that we all nearly froze to death last night, thermometer away below 32 degrees in the shade all night.|$|E
6000|$|... "Say," [...] said Pescud, {{stirring}} his discarded {{book with}} the toe of his right shoe, [...] "did you ever read one of these best-sellers? I mean the kind where the hero is an American swell--sometimes even from Chicago--who {{falls in love with a}} royal princess from Europe who is travelling under an alias, and follows her to her father's kingdom or principality? <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have.</b> They're all alike. Sometimes this going-away masher is a Washington newspaper correspondent, and sometimes he is a Van Something from New York, or a Chicago wheat-broker worthy fifty millions. But he's always ready to break into the king row of any foreign country that sends over their queens and princesses to try the new plush seats on the Big Four or the B. and O. There doesn't seem to be any other reason in the book for their being here.|$|E
6000|$|Old Mother Nature {{turned her}} head to hide the twinkle in her eyes. When she turned toward Peter again her face was severe as before. [...] "That is no excuse, Peter Rabbit," [...] said she. [...] "You should be {{sufficiently}} strong-minded not to yield to temptation. Yielding to temptation is the cause of most of the trouble in this world. It has made man an enemy to Jack Rabbit. Jack just cannot keep away from the crops planted by men. His family is very large, and when a lot of them get together in a field of clover or young wheat, or in a young orchard where the bark on the trees is tender and sweet, they do so much damage that the owner is hardly to be blamed for becoming angry and seeking to kill them. Yes, I am sorry to say, Jack Rabbit becomes a terrible nuisance when he goes where he has no business. Now <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> learned sufficient about your long-legged cousins. I've a great deal to do, so skip along home, both of you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, we'll {{have to have}} a {{talk over}} all this," [...] said Jim, with a sudden start. [...] "I should be getting to my books, and <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better go up right away to Mamie. She's at Speedy's. She expects you with impatience. She regards you in the light of a {{favourite}} brother, Loudon." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} outlaw, [...] "if {{we got the}} money without unpleasantness, it would help to make things pleasanter for everybody, and we're going to get it, anyway. The only two men about this {{homestead}} are held up in the stable, and {{there are quite a}} few of us here. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better let us in to the safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>guessed</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> {{told me how}} {{you were}} practising, and how well you were getting on. <b>I</b> <b>guessed</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> some special purpose for taking so much pains, and you did not come in {{yesterday}} evening as usual. Then, too, you tell me he {{was hit in the}} arm, and you mentioned the other day that you were practising at that, and showed me the iron hand <b>you</b> <b>had</b> had made to hold a pistol." ...|$|R
5000|$|Penalty ControversyIn a post-game {{interview}} when Marvin Lewis {{was asked}} how Justin Smith might have avoided drawing the controversial roughing the passer penalty during the attempted sack, he responded [...] "I don’t know. <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to cuddle {{him to the}} ground." ...|$|E
5000|$|Muntz {{developed}} a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17 tubes. He often carried {{a pair of}} wire clippers, and when he thought {{that one of his}} employees was [...] "overengineering" [...] a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would tell the engineer [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to put that last part back in" [...] and walk away.|$|E
5000|$|Ed Gein was derided {{as being}} both lackluster and [...] "a disappointingly mild re-creation of true events" [...] by Variety's Robert Koehler. While Steven T. Boltz of PopMatters enjoyed Railsback's acting and the film's {{attempt to be}} {{historically}} accurate, he was critical of its occasional lapses into sensationalism and of its inconsistent characterization of Gein, and ended his review of the picture with, [...] "Is Ed Gein an attempt to bring the true story to light? I can't say. Did it? Well, yes and no. It's really a moot point. The question <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> to ask yourself is this: Are you watching for historical accuracy or for entertainment?" [...] Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times afforded the film moderate praise, commending the performances, its atmosphere, and its adherence to the fact, but went on to write, [...] "Ed Gein resists cheap humor in favor of moments that are inherently darkly comic, and tries for a seriousness of purpose, yet is at times awkward and under-inspired, creating a {{question as to whether}} so gloomy and repugnant a tale was worth telling simply for its own sake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Down cellar, an' you needn't take on no airs, ol' woman. I've {{known you}} to buy things you didn't need time an' time an' agin-tins an' things, an' <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> wish <b>you</b> <b>had</b> back that ten dollars you paid for that {{illustrated}} Bible," ...|$|R
6000|$|Whitwell had {{not taken}} any wine; {{apparently}} {{he was afraid of}} forming instantly the habit of drink if he touched it; but he tolerated Westover's pint of Zinfandel, and he seemed to warm sympathetically to a greater confidence as the painter made away with it. [...] "There's one thing I never told Cynthy yet; well, Jombateeste didn't tell me himself till after Jeff was gone; and then, thinks I, what's the use? But <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> better know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Jimmy, reflectively, [...] "if it's the {{one that}} was Barbara last time, <b>I</b> <b>guess</b> <b>I</b> do. <b>You</b> <b>have</b> been finding out the rest of it since you met her at the ranch? She was up yonder ten minutes ago." ...|$|R
