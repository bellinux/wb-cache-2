50|$|There {{are three}} types of kick (topspin) serves; the pure topspin serve, the topspin-slice serve, and the twist serve. For most, the topspin serve is hit by using an Eastern backhand grip (bevel #1) and the ball is thrown so {{that if it were}} to drop, it would land on the server's heel or head. In the topspin serve, the racquet brushes up the {{backside}} of the ball to impart topspin. In the topspin-slice or kick serve, the racquet is held with an Eastern backhand or Continental grip. The topspin-slice serve has both topspin and slice, and, when hit correctly, bounces in the opposite direction from the slice serve. An extreme serve requiring flexibility and a strong back, the American twist, is where one tosses the ball usually very far off to the left (for right-handed players) and imparts spin going the opposite direction of a topspin-slice serve. All of these serves are used to make an effective serve that nevertheless has a <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> because they clear the net with a relatively high margin of space and use the topspin to pull the ball down into the service box.|$|E

40|$|AbstractVasoconstrictor {{pathways}} through sympathetic ganglia {{appear to}} relay {{the pattern of}} signals originating in {{the central nervous system}} largely unmodified to the vasculature. Each preganglionic neuron distributes the centrally-derived signals to a number of postganglionic neurons (divergence) by way of single suprathreshold “strong” synapses. Strong synapses have a very <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> and differ from the multiple subthreshold or “weak” inputs in (a) releasing a much larger number of ACh quanta and (b) using characteristic Ca 2 + channel subtypes to trigger their release. The most prominent subtype at strong synapses is resistant to all known Ca 2 + channel antagonists. When postganglionic neurons are partially denervated, strong synapses are rapidly restored by sprouting of residual connections within the ganglia. This is the only function of weak synapses so far demonstrated. These singular properties emphasize the importance of strong synapses for guaranteeing synaptic transmission through sympathetic ganglia in vasoconstrictor pathways...|$|E

40|$|As {{the number}} of new {{transgenic}} mouse models of human neuromuscular disease continues to increase, the development of sophisticated electrophysiologic techniques for assessing the peripheral nervous system in these models has become important. Neuromuscular junction (NMJ) dysfunction, in particular, is often not detectable by morphologic or other techniques. To enable sensitive testing of murine NMJ function, we developed and tested a method for stimulated single fiber electromyography (S-SFEMG) in the gastrocnemius muscles of anesthetized mice. Jitter was assessed by measuring the mean consecutive latency difference (MCD) of single fiber responses to sciatic nerve stimulation at 2 HZ. Mean MCD values in normothermic mice were in the range of 6 - 8 micros for different strains, with no MCD values exceeding 25 micros. Reduced core temperature (to 29 degrees [...] 30 degrees C) resulted in increased jitter, whereas intubation and mechanical ventilation of mice did not alter these values. Intraperitoneal and intravenous injection of vecuronium, however, resulted in progressively increased jitter followed by blocking in continuously monitored fibers. These observations validate the utility of S-SFEMG in mice as an index of NMJ function under a variety of physiologic conditions, and suggest that a <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> for neuromuscular transmission exists at mouse NMJs.

40|$|Whether all action {{potentials}} propagate faithfully throughout axon arbors in the mammalian CNS {{has long}} been debated, and remains an important issue because many synapses occur far from the soma along extremely thin, unmyelinated, varicosity-laden branches of axon arbors. We detected unitary action potentials along individual axon branches of adult hippocampal CA 3 pyramidal cells using extracellular electrodes, and analysed their conduction across long distances (mean, 2. 1 mm) at 22 and 37 °C. Axons nearly always transmitted low-frequency impulses. At higher frequencies, most axons also transmitted impulses with striking fidelity. However, at paired-pulse frequencies {{in the hundreds of}} kilohertz range, axons exhibited variability: refractory periods ranged from 2. 5 to 10 ms at 37 °C and from 5 to 40 ms at 22 °C. Although the basis for the refractory period variability could not be determined, these limits overlap with CA 3 spike frequencies observed in vivo, raising the possibility that some axonal branches act as filters for the higher-order spikes in bursts, in contrast to the observed first-spike reliability. These results extend the observations of propagation reliability to a much longer distance and higher frequency domain than previously reported, and suggest a <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> for action potential propagation along thin, varicose axons...|$|E

Selected design parameters were the heights of front and rear ribs, and thickness of the blade. And objective function was minimizing {{the mass of the}} blade. Optimization for the nominal tillage blade was conducted considering two different cases of thickness profile: constant thickness of tillage blade in the length direction and inclined thickness. In addition, it was conducted in two different cases of <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> to consider the changes of tillage load depending on the soil characteristics: <b>higher</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> on the stress than the nominal tillage blade and lower <b>safety</b> <b>factor.</b> From the results of the optimization for the nominal tillage blade, the mass of the blade reduced by 3. 2 % under the same <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> condition.

We measured the safety factor of the mouse intestinal brush-border hydrolase maltase in series with the glucose transporter SGLT 1, for comparison with previous studies of sucrase and lactase. Dietary maltose loads increased 4 -fold from virgin to lactating mice. As in previous studies of intestinal adaptive regulation, that increase in load without change in dietary composition resulted {{in an increase in}} maltase and SGLT 1 capacities mediated non-specifically by an increase in intestinal mass, without change in maltase or SGLT 1 activities per milligram of tissue. Maltase and SGLT 1 capacities increased only sublinearly with load during lactation, such that safety factors decreased with load: from 6. 5 to 2. 4 for maltase, and from 1. 1 to 0. 5 for SGLT 1. The apparently <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> for maltase {{may be related to the}} multiple natural substrates hydrolysed by the multiple sites of maltase activity.

ST afferent activation sometimes triggers polysynaptic GABAergic circuits, which feedback onto second-order NTS neurons. Although inhibitory transmission is observed at second-order neurons, much less {{is known about the}} organization and mechanisms regulating GABA transmission. Here, we used a focal pipette to deliver minimal stimulus shocks near second-order NTS neurons in rat brainstem slices and directly activated single GABAergic axons. Most minimal focal shocks activated low jitter EPSCs from single axons with characteristics resembling ST afferents. Much less commonly (9 % of sites), minimal focal shocks activated monosynaptic IPSCs at fixed latency (low jitter) that often failed (30 %) and had no frequency-dependent facilitation or depression. These GABA release characteristics contrasted markedly to the unfailing, large amplitudes for glutamate released during ST-EPCSs recorded from the same neurons. Surprisingly, unitary GABAergic IPSCs were only weakly calcium dependent. In some neurons, strong focal shocks evoked compound IPSCs indicating convergent summation of multiple inhibitory axons. Our studies demonstrate that second-order NTS neurons receive GABAergic transmission from a diffuse network of inhibitory axons that rely on an intrinsically less reliable and substantially weaker release apparatus than ST excitation. Effective inhibition depends on co-activation of convergent inputs to blunt excitatory drive. Restricted Access: Metadata Onl...|$|E

The goal {{of the present study was}} to analyse the safety factor of the human femur in the two most frequent daily activities, level walking and stair climbing, and to understand the dependence, if any, of this safety factor on age, volumetric bone mineral density (vBMD), and gender. To this aim, a finite element study was performed on 200 subjects (116 women and 84 men), spanning a large range of age (23 - 84 years) and vBMD levels (T-score from 0 to - 3. 59). For the first time, finite element models that included a subject-specific description of the anatomy and mineral density distribution of each bone were coupled with a personalisation of the loads acting on the proximal femur during movement, including the action of the muscles and their variability across the population. The results demonstrate that the human proximal femur is characterised by a <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> (on average five, never reaching fracture threshold), even in the presence of advanced age and low mineral content.

Tegus (family Teiidae) are an ideal lineage with which to expand sampling of limb bone loading mechanics for sprawling taxa, particularly for lizards, because they are from a different clade than previously sampled iguanas and exhibit different foraging and locomotor habits (actively foraging carnivore versus burst-activity herbivore). We evaluated the mechanics of locomotor loading for the femur of the Argentine black and white tegu (Tupinambus merianae) using three- dimensional measurements of the ground reaction force and hindlimb kinematics, in vivo bone strains and femoral mechanical properties. Peak bending stresses experienced by the femur were low (tensile: 10. 4 ± 1. 1 MPa; compressive: – 17. 4 ± 0. 9 MPa) and comparable to those in other reptiles, with moderate shear stresses and strains also present.

In 38 / 40 cells ongoing action potentials showed strong cardiac rhythmicity (93. 4 ± 1. 9 % modulation) indicating high barosensitivity and probable muscle vasoconstrictor (MVC) function. Subthreshold excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) showed the same pattern. The 38 barosensitive neurons fired action potentials at 2. 9 ± 0. 3 Hz. All action potentials were triggered by EPSPs, {{most of which were}} unitary events. Calculations indicated that < 5 % of action potentials were triggered by summation of otherwise subthreshold EPSPs. ‘Dominant’ synaptic inputs with a <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> were identified, confirming previous work. These were active in 24 / 38 cells and accounted for 32 % of all action potentials; other (‘secondary’) inputs drove the remainder. Inputs (21 dominant, 19 secondary) attributed to single preganglionic neurons fired at 1. 38 ± 0. 16 Hz. An average of two to three preganglionic neurons were estimated to drive each ganglion cell's action potentials. When cells were held hyperpolarized to block spiking, a range of spontaneous EPSP amplitudes was revealed. Threshold equivalent was defined as the membrane potential value that was exceeded by spontaneous EPSPs at the same frequency as the cell's original firing rate. In 10 / 12 cells examined, a continuum of EPSP amplitudes overlapped threshold equivalent. Small changes in cell excitability could therefore raise or lower the percentage of preganglionic inputs triggering action potentials.

Our computer model incorporated simulated sodium and potassium ion channels based on steady-state and kinetic parameters derived from a recent electrophysiological study. The model responded to sustained depolarizations with a single action potential {{at all levels of}} depolarization above threshold. By varying several parameters of the sodium and potassium currents systematically, the minimum changes necessary to produce repetitive firing were found to be a positive shift in the half-inactivation and a negative shift in the half-activation potentials for the sodium current, accompanied by a slowing of the rate of inactivation to half of the experimentally observed values.

Numerous studies underline the functional aspects leading to their strong adhesion to smooth surfaces, but rarely has their role {{been studied in}} the context of natural habitats and surfaces that animals are faced with. In hunting spiders, the hairy foot pads (claw tufts) underneath the paired claws are assumed to be an adaptation to a climbing lifestyle, particularly on smooth plant surfaces. However, surfaces that are too smooth for claws to generate a sufficient grip are rather rare in natural habitats and above-ground habitats are occupied by hunting spiders both with and without claw tufts. In this study we estimated the proportion of claw tuft-bearing hunting spiders (ct+ ratio) among microhabitat-specific assemblages by conducting both a field study and a meta-analysis approach. The effect of surface characteristics, structure fragmentation and altitude of the microhabitat niche on the ct+ ratio was analyzed. We hypothesized that the ct+ ratio will be higher in (i) hunting spider assemblages obtained from microhabitats above the ground than from those at the ground and (ii) in hunting spider assemblages obtained from microhabitats with smoother surfaces (tree foliage) than those with rougher surfaces (barks, stones), and lower in (iii) hunting spider assemblages obtained from microhabitats with more fragmented structures (small leaves) than in those with comparable but less fragmented structures (large leaves). We found the ct+ ratio to be significantly affected by the microhabitat's distance from the ground, whereas surface characteristics and fragmentation of the substrates were of minor importance. This suggests that claw tufts are highly beneficial when the microhabitat's height exceeds a value where the additional pad-related costs are exceeded by the costs of dropping. We assume the benefit to be mainly due to gaining a <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> at a lower energy demand if compared to alternative attachment devices (claws, silk).

Because of this uncertainty, in practice, 20 MPa is assumed and a <b>high</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> is applied. Therefore, more research on glass' strength is important. This thesis focusses on gaining {{a better understanding of the}} biaxial strength of glass. This was achieved by performing a literature study and conducting strength tests and microscopic observations. A ring on ring test was chosen for the tensile biaxial strength testing. 53 cruciform plates were tested of which 5 with a rosette strain gauge. It was found that the ring on ring formula, that gives the biaxial tensile stress within the inner loading ring, deviates around 20 % from the strain measurements. This can be attributed to assumptions that were made to derive the formula. Therefore, the formula should be further explored with more strain measurements and, if necessary, finite element modelling. Additionally, there was a variability in the strain measurements, which might have been caused by friction. Moreover, 30 out of the 53 tested plates showed circumferential cracking at the support ring, which is not mentioned in literature. For these tests, recommended ratios from biaxial testing on ceramics were applied. 10 tests of glass plates with different ratios resulted in no circumferential cracking at the support ring. It was concluded that the recommended ratios should be changed for the application on glass. A traditional fractographic analysis of glass consists of a fracture pattern analysis by eye and a fracture surface analysis by eye and by microscope. In this research, it was suggested to also study the fracture pattern by microscope. By using a transmitted light microscope with Z axis builder software a multifcous image was obtained representing all flaws and fracture marks throughout the thickness of the glass plates. This turned out to be a valuable addition, because this image revealed fracture marks that would otherwise have been overlooked. These can be used as a quick guide to find the fracture origin and give new insights on the crack propagation. In future research, it is recommended to optimise the ring on ring test so that certainty is acquired about the strength results. With a fractographic analysis, different flaw types can be characterised. It is expected that when these flaw types are related to the strength data, more sensible Weibull plots can be made. This information can then be used as an input for a better glass strength assessment and improvement. Material ScienceStructural EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

40|$|Geofoam is a geosintetik {{material}} made of Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) and Xtruded Polystyrene (XPS), {{which has}} a low weight property which makes geofoam widely used as a lightweight fill material and has been applied in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe. This is a preliminary research that emphasizes {{on the use of}} geofoam as a fill material on soft ground through theoretical analysis using Plaxis program. Supporting data used covers data of basic and fill ground taken from specific locations which are planned for subsequent research as a field test. Based on the Plaxis program results, the use of geofoam as a fill material give a <b>higher</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> value with a smaller deformation compared to laterite soil. This result indicates that the use of geofoam as a fill material can be considered to be applied in the country.  </p...|$|R
40|$|Finite element {{analysis}} and computer-aided design are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and {{their responses to}} external stimuli. This paper explores how these techniques were employed in a highly iterative design process to improve the rear chassis of a pedal-powered tricycle. The tricycle, which is used in Lagos, Nigeria to collect and transport waste materials, is regularly ridden on rough terrain with loads greater than 600 pounds, and thus requires a frame that can be subjected to large loads without failure. The design process resulted in a chassis frame that is stiffer and has a <b>higher</b> <b>safety</b> <b>factor</b> than previous designs, but can still be made from low cost, locally sourced parts. by Elliot Avila.
