500|$|Speaking in October 2016, Tsakalotos {{said that}} he wanted the IMF to join the bailout {{programme}} and that Wolfgang Schäuble's position on debt relief for Greece was untenable. Schäuble said that the bailout programme [...] "will work, the IMF will be on board and there won't be much debt relief." [...] However, Tsakalotos said that [...] "Something has to give there, and I think deep down in his heart he understands that. He's a wily politician. He's {{been around for a}} long time. I can't believe he doesn't understand you can't <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> three things." ...|$|E

[...] Brown also reported hearing about a relationship between them. [...] "I've been hearing about Robert and Aaliyah for a while—that she was pregnant. Or that she was coming and {{going in and out of}} his house. People would see her walking his dog, 12 Play, with her basketball cap and sunglasses on. Every time I asked the label, they said it was platonic. But I kept hearing complaints from people about her being in the studio with all those men. At 15," [...] Brown said. [...] "you <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> hormones and no brains attached to them." ...|$|E

2500|$|In Kansas City Bomber Raquel Welch {{played a}} {{hardened}} derby star and single mother {{that tries to}} balance her desire for a happy personal life and her dreams of stardom. Life dubbed Welch the “hottest thing on wheels” for her role. The production of the film shut down for six weeks after Welch broke her wrist doing some of her own stunts. In the interim, she flew to Budapest and filmed a cameo in Bluebeard (1972) opposite Richard Burton. Although Kansas City Bomber was not considered a critical success, it vividly depicted gender relations in the early 1970s. In a 2012 interview with GQ, Welch reflected on the roller derby world depicted in the film: [...] "You <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> women out there, but {{the men in the}} front office are really running it. Which I thought was a really nice metaphor for the way a lot of women felt about their lives at that time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first {{track on}} the album is [...] "Manos al Aire", an uptempo dance-influenced track, which Furtado says is about [...] "having a heated argument" [...] with her love interest. During the chorus, she puts up the [...] "white flag" [...] and [...] "surrenders" [...] to him. Another song from the album entitled, [...] "Bajo Otra Luz", Furtado proclaimed, is about [...] "when {{you are in a}} {{relationship}} and you are under a light. You feel like something is glowing on you and there is something different about the world. You can’t put your finger on it." [...] The seventh track, [...] "Suficiente Tiempo", is a description of the busy life of an overworked wife who is [...] "trying to make time for a date night". Furtado said that the album was [...] "purposefully collaboration-heavy" [...] because she [...] "want it to sound like a community effort. I wanted it to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> layers of experience" [...] She also collaborated with Josh Groban on a song entitled, [...] "Silencio" [...] and called the collaboration a [...] "huge blessing." [...] She felt it was important to feature [...] "an artist that people know more for their English recordings" [...] because she wanted to demonstrate that [...] "language isn't a barrier when it comes to music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Michael Musto of The Village Voice {{commented on}} the media's {{reaction}} to the incident, saying, [...] "Janet became a symbolic Joan of Arc to burn at the stake. I actually do think her breast {{was used as a}} diversionary tactic – I'm not sure to distract from Iraq specifically – but it did distract from important issues, from things we actually should be appalled by. The story got an undue amount of attention when the fact is, nobody has proved how her breast harmed anyone." [...] Speaking to Robert Tannenbaum of Blender Magazine, Jackson had strong, if guarded, views on the reactions, saying the furor [...] "is hypocritical, with everything you see on TV. There are more important thing to focus on than a woman's body part, which is a beautiful thing. There's war, famine, homelessness, AIDS". The fact that it happened in an election year [...] "did have {{a great deal to do}} with it. They needed something to focus on instead of the war, and I was the perfect vehicle for that. People are going to think what they want. It was an accident. It was not a stunt. That was embarrassing for me to <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> people see my breast. That's like having your penis hanging out in front of millions and millions of people." [...] Janet declared the reaction to the accidental exposure as [...] "contradictory", noting it to occur in an era where commercials for beer and Viagra are both [...] "very sexual" [...] and [...] "practically omnipresent". Jackson also said the mishap was [...] "not intentional" [...] and a [...] "costume accident", also commenting on some media outlets editing her taped apology, saying, [...] "Sometimes they cut out that I said it was an accident...That's what the media does, that's the way they are because they want it to be told a different way." [...] In Glamour Magazine, Janet exclaimed, [...] "It's hard to believe that there's a war and famine going on in the world and yet people made such a big deal about a breast. People said that it was done intentionally to sell records. Do you know what? I have never pulled a stunt. Why would you do that and have your album come out two months later? It doesn't make sense." [...] In the ensuing months, Janet felt overwhelmed by the hostility towards her. [...] "People think I'm immune to being hurt by what's said. They ask me questions that shock me. Not everybody is as strong as the next person and words can kill. People push you and you start to think, 'Can I handle this?' But I know I can." ...|$|E
