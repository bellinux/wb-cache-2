40|$|We have {{measured}} {{excesses of}} Pd, Rh, Ru, REE, Co, Sr, and Y in a peat column from the Northern peat bog of the 1908 Tunguska explosion site. Earlier, in this peat column {{the presence of}} an Ir anomaly at the event layers (30 - 45 cm depth) has been found (Planet Space Sci. 48 (1998) 179). In these layers, Pd, Rh, Ru, Co, Sr, and Y show pronounced anomalies of a factor 4 - 7 higher than the background value. In the event layers there are also good correlations between the siderophile platinum group elements (Pd, Rh, Ru) and Co, indicators of cosmic material, which imply they might have the same source, i. e. the Tunguska <b>explosive</b> <b>body.</b> The patterns of CI-chondrite-normalized REE in the event layers are much flatter than those in normal peat layers and different from those in the nearby traps. Furthermore, in these layers the patterns of CI-chondrite-normalized PGEs and the element ratios (e. g. C/Pd, C/Rh, and between some siderophile elements) give evidence that the Tunguska <b>explosive</b> <b>body</b> was more likely a comet, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the impactor could be a carbonaceous asteroid. We have estimated the total mass of a solid component of the <b>explosive</b> <b>body</b> up to 103 - 106 tons. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases {{belong to}} a highly conserved family of Ser-Thr protein kinases in the human kinome and have diverse roles in broad {{physiological}} functions. The 4 best-characterized MAP kinase pathways, ERK 1 / 2, JNK, p 38, and ERK 5, have been implicated in different aspects of cardiac regulation, from development to pathological remodeling. Recent advancements {{in the development of}} kinase-specific inhibitors and genetically engineered animal models have revealed significant new insights about MAP kinase pathways in the heart. However, this <b>explosive</b> <b>body</b> of new information also has yielded many controversies about the functional role of specific MAP kinases as either detrimental promoters or critical protectors of the heart during cardiac pathological processes. These uncertainties have raised questions on whether/how MAP kinases can be targeted to develop effective therapies against heart diseases. In this review, recent studies examining the role of MAP kinase subfamilies in cardiac development, hypertrophy, and survival are summarized. (Circulation. 2007; 116 : 1413 - 1423.)

40|$|Factors {{affecting}} repeated sprint ability (RSA) {{were evaluated}} in a mixed-longitudinal sample of 48 elite basketball players 14 to 19 {{years of age}} (16. 1 ± 1. 7 years). Players were observed on six occasions during the 2008 - 2009 and 2009 - 2010 seasons. Three basketball-specific field tests were administered on each occasion: the Shuttle Sprint Test (SST) for RSA, the Vertical Jump (VJ) for lower <b>body</b> <b>explosive</b> strength (power), and the Interval Shuttle Run Test (ISRT) for interval endurance capacity. Height and weight were measured; body composition was estimated (percent fat, lean body mass). Multilevel modeling of RSA development curve was used with 32 players (16. 0 ± 1. 7 years) who had two or more observations. The 16 players (16. 1 ± 1. 8 years) measured on only one occasion were used as a control group to evaluate {{the appropriateness of the}} model. Age, lower <b>body</b> <b>explosive</b> strength, and interval endurance capacity significantly contributed to RSA (p. 05). The results suggest a potentially important role for the training of lower <b>body</b> <b>explosive</b> strength and interval endurance capacity in the development of RSA among youth basketball players.

Numerical methods of computer modeling {{are used for}} construct that devises more and more. Quantity of these methods depends on adequacy level of created mathematical model to real physical process. In this article questions of design adequacy mathematical model of deforming process of special device body under inner pressure of home-made bomb explosion are discussed. Mathematical model adequacy is controlled by comparison modeling and experimental results. Computer program "ANSYS/LS-DYNA" was used for mathematical researching. Because of mathematical model have to consist as gas part (detonation product, air) as metal part (defuse home-made <b>explosive</b> bombs devise <b>body)</b> {{it was based on}} Lagrange-Euler method of describing behavior of different materials under shock. Expansion of detonation products was described by JWL equation of state.

In order to find values of that model parameters for the paper bomb body spatial experiments were carried out. Conclusions: Mode of deformation definition method of defuse home-made explosive bombs devise was created. That method bases on adequacy mathematical model which describes home-made bomb explosion process which places inside of devise align. Increasing of paper bomb body thickness to 16 mm leads to decreasing plastic deformation of outer surface of defuse home-made <b>explosive</b> bombs devise <b>body</b> by straight line low with a coefficient 0, 002 1 /mm and decreasing level expansion that surface up to 1 mm.

In so doing, we must also not create an environment conducive to use by terrorists in creating a climate of fear.

Terrorists now have the capability to surgically implant <b>explosives</b> in <b>body</b> cavities thus becoming a new type of suicide bomber. Those in the front line of identifying and taking necessary action to counter these new techniques of destruction would be well advised to read Dr. Bunker and Dr. Flahertys’ realistic assessment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the health of {{individuals}} over a sample of university students, by measuring variables related to fitness as a basis for reorienting physical activity programmes offered by the university sports services to optimise healthy physical condition of its users. We developed a descriptive study with a sample of 217 students of the University of Vigo applying battery tests AFISAL-INEFC variables measuring health-related physical condition variables: body composition, muscular strength, flexibility and maximal oxygen uptake. Since not all variables are normally distributed we used the nonparametric tests Mann-Whitney U and Chi-Square (χ 2), using a significance level of p < 0. 05. The results showed that in the hand-grip variables, peak oxygen consumption and lower <b>body</b> <b>explosive</b> power, women had a higher percentage of individuals with low fitness. The opposite situation occurred with the variable of trunk flexibility and hamstring muscles where men showed a lesser capacity. From a global view, the lower <b>body</b> <b>explosive</b> strength was the variable in which the university had a worse condition with 65. 3 % of subjects with low fitness.

40|$|Duration {{of static}} {{stretching}} {{is the most}} crucial factor associated with static stretch-induced impairments in explosive muscular performances. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the acute residual effects of lower body short (S-SS) and long duration static stretching protocols (L-SS) on counter movement jump (CMJ) performances in skilled female combat athletes. Twelve well-trained female combat athletes (training experience: 11. 5 ∓ 3. 6 years) performed S-SS (6 min of total stretch duration) and L-SS (12 min of total stretch duration) separated by 48 hours in a randomized, balanced order. After each protocol, participants performed, respectively, counter movement jump with arm swing (CMJAS) and with hands on hip (CMJHH) separated by 30 -second rest interval at the 15 th second and 1 st, 5 th, 10 th, 15 th, and 20 th minute of the 20 -minute recovery period. An insignificant interaction effect was found for Protocol × Time in CMJ heights (p = 0. 722) indicating that both S-SS and L-SS reduced CMJ heights to a similar extent over the course of 20 min recovery period. S-SS and L-SS led to a mean CMJ height reduction of 6. 29 % (p < 0. 05, d = 0. 603) and 6. 74 % (p < 0. 05, d = 0. 610), respectively. Greater than 50 % of participants experienced a reduction in CMJAS height exceeding minimum detectable change score with 90 % confidence at each time point during the recovery period without exception. Use of static stretching protocols ≥ 6 minutes prior to competitions and/or training sessions may lead to impairment in lower <b>body</b> <b>explosive</b> strength of well-trained female combat athletes that persists at least 20 minutes. This impairment may also indirectly hinder their sport-specific performance since combat sports include a great deal of movement patterns related to lower <b>body</b> <b>explosive</b> strength...|$|R
