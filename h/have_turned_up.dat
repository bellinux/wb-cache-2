25|$|Critical historians treated this legend as an idle tale {{and denied}} the historicity of King Gundaphorus until modern {{archeology}} established {{him as an}} important figure in North India {{in the latter half}} of the 1st century. Many coins of his reign <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> in Afghanistan, the Punjab, and the Indus Valley.

According to the legend, Thomas was a skilled carpenter and was bidden to build a palace for the king. However, the Apostle decided to teach the king a lesson by devoting the royal grant to acts of charity and thereby laying up treasure for the heavenly abode. Although little is known of the immediate growth of the church, Bar-Daisan (154–223) reports that in his time there were Christian tribes in North India which claimed to have been converted by Thomas and to have books and relics to prove it. But at least by the year of the establishment of the Second Persian Empire (226), there were bishops of the Church of the East in northwest India, Afghanistan and Baluchistan, with laymen and clergy alike engaging in missionary activity.|$|E
25|$|Saturn's {{second largest}} moon Rhea has been {{hypothesized}} {{to have a}} tenuous ring system of its own consisting of three narrow bands embedded in a disk of solid particles. These putative rings have not been imaged, but their existence has been inferred from Cassini observations in November 2005 of a depletion of energetic electrons in Saturn's magnetosphere near Rhea. The Magnetospheric Imaging Instrument (MIMI) observed a gentle gradient punctuated by three sharp drops in plasma flow {{on each side of}} the moon in a nearly symmetric pattern. This could be explained if they were absorbed by solid material in the form of an equatorial disk containing denser rings or arcs, with particles perhaps several dm to approximately a m in diameter. A more recent piece of evidence consistent with the presence of Rhean rings is a set of small ultraviolet-bright spots distributed in a line that extends three quarters of the way around the moon's circumference, within 2 degrees of the equator. The spots have been interpreted as the impact points of deorbiting ring material. However, targeted observations by Cassini of the putative ring plane from several angles <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> nothing, suggesting that another explanation for these enigmatic features is needed.|$|E

25|$|Mammalian {{carnivores}} {{can compete}} {{for some of}} the same prey as golden eagles but can also themselves become prey, the main prey family of carnivores being the canids (dog family). 12 species of canid are known to have been hunted by golden eagles and they collectively make up about 2.8% of the diet from all surveyed golden eagle nests. For the most part, foxes are the preferred prey, usually as juveniles though foxes of any age or condition, including adult male red foxes (Vulpes vulpes) heavier than the eagles themselves, may be hunted. Across much of both species' ranges, red fox co-exist with golden eagles and eagles hunt them in small numbers. Red foxes make up 13.5% of nest remains in Sicily and 5.9% in the Republic of Macedonia. In a nest in Mongolia, Corsac fox (Vulpes corsac) were surprisingly the main prey species, making up 38% of sampled remains. Kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), swift fox (Vulpes velox), gray fox (Urocyon cinereoargenteus) and island fox (Urocyon littoralis) are readily predated in North America. The other family of carnivores that turns up with some regularity in the golden eagle's diet are the mustelids, at about 2.3% of the diet. Everything in this diverse family from least weasels (Mustela nivalis), the smallest mammalian carnivore, to wolverines (Gulo gulo), the largest terrestrial mustelid, <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> as prey in golden eagle nests. The members of this family which are most regularly hunted are probably the martens, such as the American marten (Martes americanus), pine marten (Martes martes) and beech marten. The young of larger species are also occasionally hunted in Scotland and Ireland, including Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) and Eurasian badgers (Meles meles). Similarly, amongst wolverines, “young and inexperienced” specimens are usually targeted as prey by golden eagles. In North America, full-grown large mustelids, including American badgers (Taxidea taxus) and fishers (Martes pennanti), have also turned up as prey. The largest percentage of mustelids was 13.2% in a nest in central Alaska. Mustelids, mainly martens, turned up in large numbers in the French Alps where they made up 10.1% of nest remains.|$|E
25|$|After the leporids, {{the next}} most {{significant}} group in the diet of golden eagles is the ground squirrels. They comprise about 11.2% of the prey taken by this species across the range. In areas where leporids are scarce, this group of rodents seems to become more prominent. In {{many parts of the}} golden eagle's range, ground squirrels are rare or absent, such as the British Isles, the Iberian Peninsula and some portions of central Eurasia. Nonetheless, all of the large Spermophilus group, all species of prairie dog, all four species of antelope squirrel and all the species of marmot has been found as golden eagle prey. Nests in Denali National Park in Alaska included, among a sampling of 690 remains, contained 84.2% Arctic ground squirrels (Spermophilus parryii). Studies in Alaska have shown that the other major prey species in Alaska, the willow ptarmigan and the snowshoe hare, follow an 8 to 11 year population cycle. The locally abundant ground squirrels have less dramatic population variations and come out of hibernation in mid to late May (shortly after the eagles return from migration). The Alaskan Arctic ground squirrel appears to be eaten supplementally in peak years but then fill the primary niche when the ptarmigan and hare populations crash. In Alberta, Columbian ground squirrels (Spermophilus columbianus) (occasionally supplemented by other species like yellow-bellied marmots) were the primary prey species, making up 84% of the diet of eagles nesting there. In the French Alps, the most significant prey species is the Alpine marmot (Marmota marmota) at 68.9% out of a sampling of 198 from 6 nests. This is also the main prey species in the Italian Alps above the tree line, comprising 49.7% of a sample size of 79 from 12 nests. In the Caspian Sea area of Kazakhstan, yellow ground squirrels (Spermophilus fulvus) are the most important mammalian prey at 23.4% of a sampling of 468 from 36 nests. Along Coastal California, California ground squirrels (Spermophilus beecheyi) replace black-tailed jackrabbits (which are scarce there) as the primary prey species. In Washington state, where the golden eagle inhabits mainly forest openings made by humans, the yellow-bellied marmot (Marmota flaviventris) is the main prey species, making up 41.8% of a sampling of 47 from 2 nests and 40.3% of a sampling of 315 from 74 nests. In many other areas, ground squirrels are secondary prey, usually ranking after lagomorphs in dietary significance. This is especially true in the contiguous Western United States outside of Washington state and coastal California where they often register as second, third or even fourth most represented family by remains. Prairie dogs feature only as supplemental prey for breeding golden eagles but wintering eagles reportedly prey heavily on colonies of black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus). Although rare, tree squirrels <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> as prey in some eagle nests in both North America and Eurasia.|$|E

500|$|The Point juts {{into the}} sea on a north-facing coast, which means that migrant birds {{may be found in}} spring and autumn, {{sometimes}} in huge numbers when the weather conditions force them towards land. Numbers are relatively low in spring, but autumn can produce large [...] "falls", such as the hundreds of European robins on 1 October 1951 or more than 400 common redstarts, on 18 September 1995. The common birds are regularly accompanied by scarcer species like greenish warblers, great grey shrikes or Richard's pipits. Seabirds may be sighted passing the Point, and migrating waders feed on the marshes at this time of year. Vagrant rarities <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> when the weather is appropriate, including a Fea's or Zino's petrel in 1997, a trumpeter finch in 2008, and an alder flycatcher in 2010.

A notable recovery was a Sandwich tern killed for food in Angola, and a Radde's warbler trapped for ringing in 1961 was only the second British record of this species at that time. In the winter, the marshes hold golden plovers and wildfowl including common shelduck, Eurasian wigeon, brent geese and common teal, while common scoters, common eiders, common goldeneyes and red-breasted mergansers swim offshore.|$|E
500|$|Private {{equity in}} the 1980s was a {{controversial}} topic, commonly associated with corporate raids, hostile takeovers, asset stripping, layoffs, plant closings and outsized profits to investors. [...] As private equity reemerged in the 1990s it began to earn a new degree of legitimacy and respectability. [...] Although in the 1980s, many of the acquisitions made were unsolicited and unwelcome, private equity firms in the 1990s focused on making buyouts attractive propositions for management and shareholders. [...] According to The Economist, “ig companies that would once <b>have</b> <b>turned</b> <b>up</b> their noses at an approach from a private-equity firm are now pleased {{to do business with}} them.” Additionally, private equity investors became increasingly focused on the long term development of companies they acquired, using less leverage in the acquisition. [...] In the 1980s leverage would routinely represent 85% to 95% of the purchase price of a company as compared to average debt levels between 20% and 40% in leveraged buyouts in the 1990s and {{the first decade of the}} 21st century. [...] KKR's 1986 acquisition of Safeway, for example, was completed with 97% leverage and 3% equity contributed by KKR, whereas KKR's acquisition of TXU in 2007 was completed with approximately 19% equity contributed ($8.5 billion of equity out of a total purchase price of $45 billion). [...] Additionally, private equity firms are more likely to make investments in capital expenditures and provide incentives for management to build long-term value.|$|E
