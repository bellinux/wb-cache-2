Its 12-gauge shotguns were the standard used by the Los Angeles Police Department and New York Police Department, and even sold to the Royal Thai Army in the early 1980s to arm farmers against communist infiltrators. Its hunting shotguns were known for their fine decorative work, typically waterfowl or hunting dogs. In 1989, Remington purchased a design from Ithaca, the Mag-10 shotgun, which they produced as the SP-10.|$|E
2500|$|The M14 was {{developed}} to replace seven different weapons—the M1 Garand, Springfield M1903, Enfield M1917, M1 carbine, M3 <b>Grease</b> <b>Gun,</b> Thompson M1928/M1, and M1918 Browning automatic rifle (BAR). The intention was to simplify the logistical requirements of the troops by limiting the types of ammunition and parts needed to be supplied. However, {{it proved to be}} an impossible task to replace all four. The M14 was also deemed [...] "completely inferior" [...] to the World War II M1 Garand in a September 1962 report by the U.S. Department of Defense comptroller. The cartridge was too powerful for the submachine gun role and the weapon was simply too light to serve as a light machine gun replacement for the BAR.|$|E

2500|$|In {{anticipation}} of ambushing the assault force, the German defenders had placed an infantry {{company in the}} nearby woods. When the men of C Company began deploying their towed guns, the German infantry attacked the anti-tank guns, and C Company's men, though armed only with M1 carbines, [...]45 pistols, and submachine guns, responded in kind. One half-track driver, surprised from behind by a German infantry squad, mowed down eight of his attackers with several blasts from his [...]45 caliber <b>grease</b> <b>gun.</b> Despite heavy casualties, the 614th repulsed the German infantry attack, killing most of the assault force. By nightfall, when the engagement ended, only sporadic small-arms fire came from the town, which was quickly seized by American troops. Defeated, surviving enemy forces retired to the Siegfried Line.|$|E
2500|$|Following their post-sleep period, {{the crews}} {{set to work}} {{preparing}} for the first spacewalk of the mission. Stefanyshyn-Piper and Bowen were suited up and in the airlock ahead of schedule, and the EVA started at 18:09 UTC, with Piper becoming the first female Lead Spacewalker. While Piper was preparing to begin work on the SARJ, she noticed {{a significant amount of}} grease in her tool bag, [...] "I think we had a <b>grease</b> <b>gun</b> explode in the large bag, because there's grease in the bag," [...] Piper reported to Kimbrough, who was working inside the shuttle to help coordinate the EVA. Mission Control managers instructed Piper to clean up the grease using a dry wipe, and while she was doing the cleanup, one of the crew lock bags floated away. [...] "I guess one of my crew lock bags was not transferred and it's loose," [...] Piper told Kimbrough. The bag floated aft and starboard of the station, and did not pose a risk to the station or orbiter. After taking an inventory of the items inside the lost bag, managers on the ground determined that Bowen had all those items in his bag, and the two could share equipment. While it extended the EVA duration slightly, the major objectives were not changed, and all EVA tasks were accomplished. The estimated value of the lost tool bag was US$100,000. An amateur astronomer later observed the tool bag as it orbited the Earth prior to re-entering. It {{was not the first time}} that equipment had got away from spacewalkers, items lost in the past include tools, nuts and bolts, glue guns, cameras, cloths, and even a robotic arm.

5000|$|A <b>grease</b> <b>gun</b> is {{a common}} {{workshop}} and garage tool used for lubrication. The purpose of the <b>grease</b> <b>gun</b> is to apply lubricant through an aperture to a specific point, usually on a grease fitting or 'nipple'. The channels behind the grease nipple lead to where the lubrication is needed. The aperture may be of a type that fits closely with a receiving aperture on any number of mechanical devices. The close fitting of the apertures ensures that lubricant is applied only where needed. There are three types of grease gun: ...|$|E
50|$|A {{less common}} design {{has a few}} names {{including}} 'button head', 'threepenny bit', 'flat' and 'tat head'.

The <b>grease</b> <b>gun</b> hose is usually at a sharp angle (e.g. 70-90°) to the axis of the nipple but can be approached from any azimuthal angle. It is not possible for grease pressure to force this type of connector away from the nipple.|$|E

5000|$|Before Zerk {{fittings}} existed, bearings were lubricated {{in various}} other ways that {{tended to be}} more maintenance-intensive and often provided less effective lubrication. For example, a typical machinery bearing of the 19th and early 20th centuries was a plain bearing with a cross-drilled hole to receive oil or grease, with no clever fitting at its mouth, or at best a cap or cup. Often lubricant was delivered under no more pressure than gravity or a finger push might provide. For example, oil was gravity-fed into the hole, or grease was pushed in. <b>Grease</b> <b>guns</b> to feed the grease with higher pressure existed, but their pre-Zerk fittings were not as good for making clean, sealed contact easily, and they were less widely used than today.|$|R

Initial responses were favorable and some sales were made, particularly to the AFP's Anti-Crime Task Force and the Philippine Navy's Special Warfare Group. The Philippine Marine Corps had a standing requirement for submachine guns to serve as personal defense weapons for armor crews and the Floro Mk. 9 was an option.
