He applauded the way the string of episodes managed to start out with self-contained stories and move into a dense and emotional backstory. Tonally, Smith described the miniseries as possessing [...] "the feel of an old-school post-apocalyptic SF sagaa journey through a devastated-but-wondrous world, {{with a sense of}} danger and mystery detached from the Land of Ooo." [...] Smith's only complaint was that [...] "there's enough rich emotional material once the voyagers reach their destination that it feels like more time could be spent there".

500|$|Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times {{felt the}} second part {{fulfilled}} all of the criteria for an incredible season finale: the season's arc had a [...] "pay-off" [...] he [...] "didn't see coming" [...] {{in the aftermath of}} Walternate crossing universes to take back Peter; the entire episode was an [...] "event" [...] because it spent more time in the parallel universe than ever before, and it had an [...] "A+ cliffhanger". MTV's Fringe reviewer Josh Wigler enjoyed the ending, calling it [...] "one <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> a cliffhanger!" [...] James Poniewozik from Time Magazine positively compared both parts of the finale to The X-Files, writing that, unlike that series, Fringes standalone episodes contribute to the overall mythology of the show.

We {{just got to}} start buying what he's selling." [...] Ditka was fired by the Saints, but as training camp for the 2000 season began, Tolliver was the Saints' backup quarterback behind Jeff Blake. On August 1, the Saints traded for quarterback Aaron Brooks, which left Tolliver {{to compete for the}} third-string spot alongside Jake Delhomme. The Saints' roster was reduced to 53 players, and Tolliver was among those cut. When the Saints lost Jeff Blake for the season in mid-November due to a dislocated foot, Tolliver was re-signed by the Saints, though he did not play a game that season. In July 2001, Tolliver was signed by the Green Bay Packers. This briefly reunited him with Brett Favre, with whom he was teammates in Atlanta. However, he was cut in the preseason when Doug Pederson won the backup job, and this stint marked the end of Tolliver's professional career.|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, others thought the music felt forced. Inevitably, almost all reviews, both {{positive}} and negative, compared the episode to Buffy the Vampire Slayers musical episode, [...] "Once More, with Feeling". This comparison was also made by Bill Lawrence, who credits Buffy for inspiring Scrubs propensity for [...] "big" [...] episodes (such as this one, the multi-camera [...] "My Life in Four Cameras", and the Wizard of Oz parody [...] "My Way Home"). The singing abilities of the cast (Chalke in particular) came under some fire, but most critics agreed that most were competent, and that anything beyond that simply did not matter. Reyes and Faison were the only members of the cast (besides the Broadway star D'Abruzzo) to receive praise for their singing abilities. In general, the final assessments were positive. The episode was called [...] "the show's best episode thus far this season", [...] "worth all the hype", and [...] "a <b>heck</b> <b>of</b> a lot of fun".

[...] Juliette Harrisson listed [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] as the seventh most groundbreaking episode of the series in 2012 for Den of Geek. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com, giving it a rating of nine out of ten. He praised the means in which Frakes made each repetition different, and the writing by Braga which he described as a [...] "tour de force". He said that [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] had [...] "the best teaser {{in the history of}} Star Trek", and summed it up by saying [...] "This is an absolute triumph of craft from both Braga and Frakes, and just a fun episode, with the added bonus of Captain Frasier Crane at the end.

True, you've had them all, but you could simply start going round the circuit again". She added that Mercedes does not have much to lose in her life. After her stalking of Mitzeee, Mercedes went on to stab herself, on this Carena Crawford of All About Soap said the episode itself was a [...] "huge shocker" [...] due to Mercedes' actions. Crawford added that when Mercedes realises she will be blamed for knocking Mitzeee unconscious she sees the knife and [...] "mad Mercedes {{came up with the}} perfect plan and we winced as she plunged the blade into her own stomach, knowing everyone would think Mitzeee did it!

500|$|There was {{a strong}} {{reaction}} from the show's viewers.

500|$|On {{the back}} of two {{consecutive}} playoff disappointments, Duncan improved statistically in the 2001–02 season. He averaged career highs in scoring (25.5 points per game, including a league-leading 764 field goals and 560 attempted free throws) and rebounding (12.7 boards per game, and his accumulated 1042 boards again led the league), and also averaged 3.7 assists and 2.5 blocks per game, both career highs. Coupled with another pair of All-NBA and All-Defensive First Team call-ups, he was named the league's Most Valuable Player, joining teammate David Robinson as the only Spurs members to earn the honor. On the other hand, Duncan's team struggled {{with the fact that}} the aging Robinson was no longer able to sustain his level of performance, and backup center-forward Malik Rose had to step in more often. In the 2002 NBA Playoffs, the Spurs were again outmatched by the Lakers. Up against star center O'Neal once more, the Spurs were defeated 4–1 by the eventual champions.
