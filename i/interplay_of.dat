5|$|The Fountain is a 2006 American epic magical realism romantic drama {{film that}} blends {{elements}} of fantasy, history, spirituality, and science fiction. It {{is directed by}} Darren Aronofsky, and stars Hugh Jackman and Rachel Weisz. The film consists of three storylines involving immortality and the resulting loves lost, and one man's pursuit of avoiding this fate in this life or beyond it. Jackman and Weisz play sets of characters bonded by love across time and space: a conquistador and his ill-fated queen, a modern-day scientist and his cancer-stricken wife, and a traveler immersed in a universal journey alongside aspects of his lost love. The storylines—interwoven with use of match cuts and recurring visual motifs—reflect the themes and <b>interplay</b> <b>of</b> love and mortality.|$|E
5|$|Biogeographical {{patterns}} and range distributions are explained or predicted through {{knowledge of a}} species' traits and niche requirements. Species have functional traits that are uniquely adapted to the ecological niche. A trait is a measurable property, phenotype, or characteristic of an organism that may influence its survival. Genes {{play an important role}} in the <b>interplay</b> <b>of</b> development and environmental expression of traits. Resident species evolve traits that are fitted to the selection pressures of their local environment. This tends to afford them a competitive advantage and discourages similarly adapted species from having an overlapping geographic range. The competitive exclusion principle states that two species cannot coexist indefinitely by living off the same limiting resource; one will always out-compete the other. When similarly adapted species overlap geographically, closer inspection reveals subtle ecological differences in their habitat or dietary requirements. Some models and empirical studies, however, suggest that disturbances can stabilize the co-evolution and shared niche occupancy of similar species inhabiting species-rich communities. The habitat plus the niche is called the ecotope, which is defined as the full range of environmental and biological variables affecting an entire species.|$|E

40|$|Short-term energy load forecasting, such as hourly {{predictions}} {{for the next}} n (n 2 ̆ 265 2) hours, will benefit from exploiting the relationships among the n estimated outputs. This paper treats such multi-steps ahead regression task as a sequence labeling (regression) problem, and adopts a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CCRF) strategy. This discriminative approach intuitively integrates two layers: the first layer aims at the prior knowledge for the multiple outputs, and the second layer employs edge potential features to implicitly model the <b>interplays</b> <b>of</b> the n interconnected outputs. Consequently, the proposed CCRF makes predictions not only basing on observed features, but also considering the estimated values of related outputs, thus improving the overall predictive accuracy. In particular, we boost the CCRF's predictive performance with a multi-target function as its edge feature. These functions convert the relationship of related outputs with continuous values into a set of "sub-relationships", each providing more specific feature constraints for the <b>interplays</b> <b>of</b> the related outputs. We applied the proposed approach to two real-world energy load prediction systems: one for electricity demand and another for gas usage. Our experimental {{results show that the}} proposed strategy can meaningfully reduce the predictive error for the two systems, in terms of mean absolute percentage error and root mean square error, when compared with three benchmarking methods. Promisingly, the relative error reduction achieved by our CCRF model was up to 50...|$|R
