5|$|According to {{an account}} by Claude Hémeré, {{a friend and}} {{librarian}} of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used {{the records of the}} collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was an important center of royal patronage. Both Jean Mouton and Loyset Compère were buried there and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> possible that Josquin acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> {{obvious that}} Jocelin {{was one of}} the most {{respected}} figures in the kingdom. In this era, the Pope appointed Jocelin Judge-delegate (of the Papacy) more times than any other cleric in the kingdom. As a bishop and an ex-abbot, various bishoprics and monasteries called him in to mediate disputes, as evidenced by his frequent appearance as a witness in dispute settlements, such as the dispute between Arbroath Abbey and the Bishopric of St Andrews, and a dispute between Jedburgh Abbey and Dryburgh Abbey. Jocelin had the respect of the secular elite too. He witnessed 24 royal charters and 40 non-royal charters, including charters issued by David, Earl of Huntingdon (the brother of King William), Donnchadh, Earl of Carrick, and Alan Fitzwalter, High Steward of Scotland. Jocelin had been with King William when he visited the English court in 1186, and again accompanied the king to England when the king travelled to Woodstock near Oxford to marry Ermengarde de Beaumont on 5 September 1186. The marriage was blessed by Bishop Jocelin in their chamber, and it was to Jocelin's escort that King William entrusted her for the journey to Scotland. When a son was born to William and Ermengarde, the future King Alexander II, it was Jocelin who performed the baptism. In April 1194, Jocelin again travelled to England in King William's company when William was visiting King Richard I. Jocelin's intimacy with the king would be the key to earning his patronage, thus making possible the legacy that Jocelin would leave to Glasgow.|$|E

25|$|Problems with Senge's vision {{include a}} failure to fully {{appreciate}} and incorporate the imperatives that animate modern organizations; the relative sophistication of the thinking he requires of managers (and whether many in practice are up to it); and questions regarding his treatment of organizational politics. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> difficult to find real-life examples of learning organizations (Kerka 1995).

Iceland spar is found in China, as well as in Iceland and some other places. Insects such as bees can respond to sky polarization and use it to find their way home. Whether the Chinese used it is hypothetical, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> possible.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} the {{scientific}} revolution the qualitative world of book-reading philosophers had been changed into a mechanical, mathematical world to be known through experimental research. Though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not true that Newtonian science was like modern science in all respects, it conceptually resembled ours in many ways. Many of the hallmarks of modern science, especially with regard to its institutionalization and professionalization, did not become standard until the mid-19th century.|$|E

25|$|Relying {{exclusively}} on unedited machine translation, however, {{ignores the fact}} that communication in human language is -embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.|$|E

Another theorem of this type is the four color theorem whose computer generated proof is too long for a human to read. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> the longest known proof of a theorem whose statement can be easily understood by a layman.|$|E

However, this and Saudi Arabia's role in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, particularly the stationing of U.S. troops on Saudi soil from 1991, prompted the development of a hostile Islamist response internally. As a result, Saudi Arabia has, to some extent, distanced itself from the U.S. and, for example, refused to support or to participate in the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003.|$|E
25|$|Ban Jieyu {{also known}} as Lady Pan (Pan Chieh-Yü) was a {{concubine}} to Emperor Cheng of Han (reigned 33-7 BC) and the great-aunt of the poet, historian, and author Ban Gu. A well-known poem in the Wen Xuan is attributed to her. Although most unlikely to actually be by her (especially since {{it is not in}} her grand-nephew Ban's biography of her), <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> written as if it could have been written by her or someone in her position. It is an important early example of the secluded palace lady genre of poetry.|$|E
25|$|Originally, {{propranolol}} {{was reserved}} for hypertension patients however, doctors are permitted to use the drug for off-label purposes leading {{to the question of}} should they. The reasons why some are skeptical is 1) it may prevent us with coming to terms with trauma, 2) tamper with our identities and lead us to a false sense of happiness, 3) demean the genuineness of human life, 4) encourage some to forget memories they are obligated to keep, and 5) inure us to the pain of others. Whether or not it is ethical to fully or partially erase the memory of a patient, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> becoming a more relevant topic as this technology improves in our society.|$|E

25|$|To {{understand}} the forces ranged against L.Ron Hubbard, {{in this war}} he never started, {{it is necessary to}} gain a cursory glimpse of the old and venerable science of psychiatry-which was actually none of the aforementioned. As an institution, it dates back to shortly {{before the turn of the}} century; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> not worthy of respect by reason of age or dignity; and it does not meet any known definition of a science, what with its hodgepodge of unproven theories that have never produced any result-except an ability to make the unmanageable and mutinous more docile and quiet, and turn the troubled into apathetic souls beyond the point of caring. That it promotes itself as a healing profession is a misrepresentation. Its mission is to control.|$|E
25|$|That Boniface {{would have}} carried a {{collection}} of books with him on his journeys is without doubt.

Still, it is possible {{that it was one of}} the books that were found afterward in Friesland and brought back to Utrecht, whence they traveled up the Rhine to Mainz and then Fulda. Marco Mostert considers it possible, even likely, that Radbod's recension of the vita made its way to Fulda, where the legend became attached to the damaged books that could have been Boniface's, and that by the tenth century the status of these books had been elevated to that of contact relics.|$|E
25|$|However, this is {{certainly}} not entirely true. Gerard cannot have spent much, if any time in prison, as he was appointed permanent counsel by the City of London in October 1554, and represented Wigan in the English parliament {{for the third time}} in 1555. Nor can he have incurred the wrath of Mary, as he was made a Serjeant-at-law, one of a small and extremely powerful group of barristers with exclusive rights to work in the Court of Common Pleas towards the end of her reign - an appointment that lapsed on her death. He was made Justice of the Peace in five counties by 1559, many of them probably in Mary's reign: Bedfordshire, Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire, Cheshire and Huntingdonshire. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>certainly</b> true that Gerard was much favoured by Elizabeth and one of a small group of lawyers who were quickly installed in important offices to consolidate the new regime.|$|E
