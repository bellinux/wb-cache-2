40|$|Graduation date: 2006 Paclitaxel {{is a very}} {{important}} anticancer drug commonly called Taxol®. We know from previous work (Hoffman, et al., 1998) that Taxol exists in filbert, Corylus avellana L. material. Quantification of Taxol in filbert plant material is painstaking and hitherto was accomplished by rapidly processing single batches in a complicated procedure (Hoffman, et al., 1998), which seemingly unavoidably, was accompanied by some degradation. However for extraction, testing, plant physiological and horticultural purposes a simplified method of determining Taxol yield is required. All simplified methods tested were found limited by rapid degradation of Taxol. Under these conditions not only is the sought product broken down, but we were unable to distinguish Taxol precursors from degradation products. Thus it was {{decided to go back to}} first principles and study the degradation of Taxol in vitro. Degradation kinetics of Taxol was studied using electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESIMS) to identify possible Taxol adducts and degradation products. Our preparation for ESIMS analysis by experimental necessity involved various other components. Since some of these components interacted with the degradation products, we developed a program to distinguish these putative adducts from spurious components found in the system and we were able to plot the pH dependence of Taxol degradation in this system at room temperature (approximately 25 oC). The results of the mass spectrometric analysis of these degradants were found dependent on pH and time. Our results show major degradation at pH 9 and beyond, plus minor degradation at pH 5. Two optimum pHs for stability were found at pH 4 and pH 7. This data varies slightly from the published results Dordunoo and Burt (1996). Our smoother curves define two pHs events in this pH range which to our knowledge, have not been reported and our temperature was lower. We hope that this information will help us extract Taxol more efficiently with greater yield from novel plant sources, e. g. hazel (<b>filbert)</b> <b>tree,</b> Corylus avellana L. The possibility of Taxol dimer formation in solution and perhaps in vivo can be inferred, but not proven, in this work. This dimer, may exist, in dynamic equilibrium with parent compound, Taxol...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1975 The {{effects of}} soil {{incorporated}} lime and K on {{the concentrations of}} N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Fe, Cu, B and Zn in the leaves of <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> (Corylus aveliana L. cv Barcelona) were investigated. One year old <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> of uniform size were grown in Laurelwood clay loam (L) and Jory silt clay loam (J) in five-gallon plastic pots. The L soil was high in exchangeable K, while soil J was low in exchangeable K as determined by soil tests. Lime treatments were made to bring the initial pH of each soil up to pH 6. 6 and 7. 1 respectively. Potassium treatments were calculated to bring the soil test levels to intermediate and high levels. Lime significantly increased the leaf concentration of K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, and Zn and decreased that of P, Mn, and B. Potassium treatments resulted in {{a significant increase in}} the leaf concentration of K, Mn, and a decrease in P, Mg, and Cu, but had no effect on the concentration of Fe, B, Zn and N. There were highly significant linear relationships between applied lime and leaf Ca and between applied K and leaf K. Trees grown in soil L were unable to take up as much K as those grown in soil J. This indicated that the soil analysis method used to measure exchangeable K was not an appropriate one to use to predict the available K for <b>filbert</b> <b>trees.</b> Further experimentation is required to develop a test which can be used to predict the K requirement for <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> grown in different soils...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1970 The {{control of}} filbert (Corylus Avellana L.) suckers {{by means of}} {{herbicides}} was investigated in three phases during 1968 and 1969. (1) Screening trials, on canned <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> in the greenhouse, to determine the effectiveness of various herbicides and concentrations in controlling vegetative growth. (2) A summary experiment in the greenhouse to quantitatively {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the three most promising herbicides selected from the screening trials. (3) Field trials to determine the effectiveness of the three herbicides at various concentrations under field conditions in a mature filbert orchard. One quart of 2, 4 -D, one quart of paraquat, or three pints of dinoseb per 100 gallons of solution gave satisfactory control of filbert suckers. Paraquat and 2, 4 -D controlled the appearance of regrowth {{to a greater extent than}} dinoseb. Use of oil with dinoseb enhanced the effect of the herbicide. Filbert suckers should be treated when less than one foot in height and thoroughly covered with spray to obtain satisfactory kill. The herbicide 2, 4 -D gave better control of larger suckers than either paraquat or dinoseb. No evidence of injury to mature <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> was seen where the above rates were used...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1986 Anisogramma anomala {{causes a}} stem canker of filberts, Corylus avellana. This disease became {{a threat to}} the main U. S. filbert growing region when it was {{introduced}} into the Pacific Northwest around 1968. Various methods of artificially inoculating <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> and seeds were explored. Less than 1 % of potted <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> inoculated with ascospores produced symptoms after 4 years. The disease was not transmitted following graft inoculation of orchard trees with infected tissue. Ascospores had no effect on germination or growth of Corylus seedlings. Spread of existing cankers was compared on the susceptible cultivar 'Daviana' and the more resistant cultivar 'Barcelona'. There was no significant difference (t=. 05) in canker elongation between cultivars, or between spread up and down the stems. Vertical elongation of perennial cankers averaged 26. 2 cm/year. Methods for storing ascospores prior to germination, and conditions for germinating ascospores were explored. Spores exhibited no loss of viability after 2 months when cankered twigs were stored below 0 ° C. Ascospores remained viable for less than 14 days following discharge in water. Drying was lethal to hydrated spores. Ascospores commenced germination 24 hours after hydration when placed on a suitable medium in a proper atmosphere. Germination occurred between 5 ° and 25 ° C, with an optimum of 20 °. Optimum pH for germination was between 4. 2 and 5. 7. A direct relationship was detected between ascospore concentration and percent germination. Eight antibiotics were screened in an attempt to prevent bacterial contamination. 10 ppm Rifampicin or 100 ppm Kanamycin effectively inhibited bacterial contaminants without affecting ascospore germination. Germination was compared on many different complex and defined media, and with different amendments added to the media. Various Corylus extracts had no effect on spore germination. 1 % ethanol and 5 % sucrose increased germination. Casamino acids, cornmeal or peptone promoted growth beyond the initial germ tube. Several stages of ascospore germination and early hyphal growth are described...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Lime {{was applied}} at {{different}} rates to <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> grown in containers in an acid soil. As lime application rate increased, the leaf Mn and extractable soil Mn were significantly reduced. In control trees leaf Mn was over 1300 ppm, but no growth reduction or Mn toxicity symptoms were found. Filbert seedlings grown in a nutrient solution at two different pH levels and at different Mn rates did not show toxicity symptoms when leaf Mn ranged from 190 to 1500 ppm. A slight Mn-induced chlorosis {{and a reduction in}} growth were apparent at Mn levels of about 1800 ppm. Severe toxicity symptoms, accompanied by a sharp reduction in growth appeared at a Mn leaf concentration of 3700 ppm. As Mn in the leaves increased, Fe decreased. However, Fe/Mn ratios did not correspond with toxicity symptoms or normal growth. Filberts appear to be extremely tolerant to high Mn in their tissues...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1981 The {{alternate}} bearing {{cycle in}} the 'Barcelona' cultivar poses {{a major problem}} to the filbert industry. This {{study was conducted to}} alleviate this problem in one of two ways: by (1) increased floral initiation in the "on" year, and (2) increased cluster set in the "off" year. Growth regulators were {{selected on the basis of}} their effectiveness when applied to other alternate bearing crops. These growth regulators were then applied to 'Barcelona' trees at the times corresponding to floral initiation and cluster set in this cultivar. During April and May, trees were treated with two concentrations (15 and 50 ppm) of GA₃ to influence cluster set. The GA₃ applications caused a large number of clusters to abscise in the season applied, however, female flower production was quadrupled for the following season. These results suggest that when applied to <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> in the spring, GA₃ may have a hormonal effect on cluster abscission. The first GA₃ application (April 20) significantly increased catkin production, indicating that the initiation of the catkins was in progress during this month. Gibberellic acid's influence on vegetative growth was minimal, with no substantial increase in shoot length or node number observed. Increased floral initiation is suggested to be the outcome of hormonal and carbohydrate level changes rather than through any dramatic change in vegetative growth. In the year following treatment, yield increases were due to the greater number of flowers initiated rather than an increase in percent cluster set. Gibberellic acid (50 ppm), TIBA (25 ppm), and ethephon (500 ppm) were also applied to 'Barcelona 1 <b>filbert</b> <b>trees</b> during the floral initiation process (July-August). Hand-thinning of nut clusters was also done during the initiation process. All of these treatments, except GA₃, resulted in increased female flower clusters the following spring. Gibberellic acid did not affect female flower initiation, however, catkin drop was accelerated. The average number of nuts per cluster, percent set, and yield were not affected by TIBA, ethephon, or GA₃ sprays in the year applied. Increased yield in the following year was attributed to the increased floral initiation brought about by the TIBA, ethephon, and hand-thinning treatments. Yield was also increased by GA₃ through greater percent set, and it is suggested the latter may be linked to the catkin abscission. The carbohydrates that would have been utilized in catkin production may have been made available to the developing nut clusters and vegetative structures, and may account for the resulting increase in yield...|$|R

40|$|Food is a {{valuable}} commodity {{that allows us to}} live. Eating habits have an influence on human health and fresh fruit is an important component of a healthy diet. Eating patterns begin to develop in early childhood, so {{it is very important that}} in this period children begin to acquire knowledge and experiences with different types of food, get to know their origin and basis of their production. 	The aim of my thesis was to allow children to directly experience and actively learn the basics of gardening and fruit production as well as to through their enthusiasm instill in them a positive attitude towards domestic fruit. In this thesis I researched how many 4 - and 5 -year-old children know the basics of gardening and how much they can learn in the process of active learning. The children through various activities learnt about the basics of gardening. Together we looked at strawberry, apple, grape, blackberry, plum, raspberry, currant, walnut plantations [...] . Next to the play field of the garden we planted an apple, a pear, a blueberry, a gooseberry, a plum, a red currant and a Red <b>Filbert</b> nut <b>tree.</b> In the garden we planted strawberries. Together we observed changes in growth and took care of the plants. We managed to produce a few fruits and it was a great experience for the children when we consumed/ate them. Before carrying out the activities I conducted an oral survey with the children regarding their knowledge of fruits and fruit production. The results showed that children with active learning through direct experience gained a lot of knowledge about the basics of gardening and fruit production. With active learning they learnt where to get strawberries, apples and walnuts, we looked at what a fruit develops from, how and why to prune fruit trees, when strawberries and apples are ripe, and which plant or tree bears which fruit. 	With all of the activities the children developed social relationships, communication, and a respectful attitude to fruit and work in the garden. I believe that they will remember this experience that a kindergarten playground can become a better playground if it has an orchard – it will teach the children, partly feed them, bring them joy and happiness, independence, freedom, physical and mental health. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1974 The {{effect of}} cycling {{temperatures}} on production of aflatoxin by Aspergillus flavus (V 3734 - 10) when grown upon various substrates was studied. The parameters of temperature and time {{were selected to}} simulate environmental conditions in Oregon during harvest of filberts and walnuts. The heat input required for aflatoxin synthesis in terms of degree hours per day were calculated and {{may be used as}} an index to predict potential danger of aflatoxin contamination. Conditions which generated less than 208 hours per day did not receive sufficient heat to induce growth and metabolism. When heat input ranged between 208 and 270 hours per day, growth and metabolism occurred with the development of a yellow pigment. There was not sufficient heat input, however, to induce the idiophase, sporulation and subsequent aflatoxin synthesis. Above 270 hours per day the culture entered the idiophase, sporulation occurred and aflatoxin was produced. The heat requirements for aflatoxin production was compared to the degree hours produced in the orchards by prevailing weather conditions at the time of harvest. The nuts are most susceptible to contamination and fungal growth during harvest when the nuts are damp and on the ground. During October and November, heat input is too low for aflatoxin production. From mid September to October heat input may be sufficient for aflatoxin production but at this time most walnuts and <b>filberts</b> are still <b>tree</b> borne and moisture in the environment {{is likely to be a}} limiting factor. A. flavus was found to be a poor competitor when grown with the natural fimgal flora isolated from moldy nut meats. On rice and nutmeat substrates, A. flavus was completely overgrown by members of the natural flora; even when A. flavus spores were present in superior numbers. Aflatoxin was not detected in the substrates of these cultures...|$|R
