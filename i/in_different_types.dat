The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of British Secret Intelligence Service agent James Bond as he fights to prevent a criminal syndicate from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The game includes a split-screen multiplayer mode in which two, three, or four players can compete <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of deathmatch games.|$|E
5|$|The {{ubiquitin}} protein {{itself is}} 76 amino acids long {{and was named}} due to its ubiquitous nature, as it has a highly conserved sequence and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms. The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats, possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell. It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest-evolving protein identified to date. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated, resulting <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of polyubiquitin chains. Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of the previous ubiquitin {{have a role in}} proteasome targeting, while other types of chains may be involved in other processes.|$|E

The Wujing Zongyao manuscript of 1044 was the first book in history to provide formulas for gunpowder and their specified use <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of bombs. While engaged in a war with the Mongols, in 1259 the official Li Zengbo wrote in his Kezhai Zagao, Xugaohou that the city of Qingzhou was manufacturing one to two thousand strong iron-cased bomb shells a month, dispatching to Xiangyang and Yingzhou about ten to twenty thousand such bombs at a time. In turn, the invading Mongols employed northern Chinese soldiers and used these same types of gunpowder weapons against the Song. By the 14th century the firearm and cannon could also be found in Europe, India, and the Islamic Middle East, during the early age of gunpowder warfare.|$|E

Epigenetic alterations are important in cellular transformation to cancer, and their manipulation holds great promise for cancer prevention, detection, and therapy. Several medications which have epigenetic impact are used in several of these diseases. These aspects of epigenetics are addressed in cancer epigenetics.|$|E

First, it helped them focus on positive life experiences, relieving their ongoing preoccupation with cancer. Second, it enhanced their self-worth and identity by providing them with opportunities to demonstrate continuity, challenge, and achievement. Third, it enabled them to maintain a social identity that resisted being defined by cancer. Finally, it allowed them to express their feelings in a symbolic manner, especially during chemotherapy.

25|$|Neurophysiological methods rely on {{utilizing}} information {{stemming from}} more direct {{and not necessarily}} conscious (pre-attentative) processes. Subjects are presented with speech stimuli <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of tasks and {{the responses of the}} brain are measured. The brain itself can be more sensitive than it appears to be through behavioral responses. For example, the subject may not show sensitivity to the difference between two speech sounds in a discrimination test, but brain responses may reveal sensitivity to these differences. Methods used to measure neural responses to speech include event-related potentials, magnetoencephalography, and near infrared spectroscopy. One important response used with event-related potentials is the mismatch negativity, which occurs when speech stimuli are acoustically different from a stimulus that the subject heard previously.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{monetary}} theory distinguishes {{among different}} ways to measure the money supply, reflected <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of monetary aggregates, using a categorization system {{that focuses on the}} liquidity of the financial instrument used as money. The most commonly used monetary aggregates (or types of money) are conventionally designated M1, M2 and M3. These are successively larger aggregate categories: M1 is currency (coins and bills) plus demand deposits (such as checking accounts); M2 is M1 plus savings accounts and time deposits under $100,000; and M3 is M2 plus larger time deposits and similar institutional accounts. M1 includes only the most liquid financial instruments, and M3 relatively illiquid instruments. The precise definition of M1, M2 etc. may be different in different countries.|$|E
25|$|CYR61 binds {{directly}} to various integrin receptors {{in a cell}} type-dependent manner, including integrin αvβ3 in endothelial cells, α6β1 and heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) in fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells αIIbβ3 in activated platelets, αMβ2 in monocytes and macrophages, and αDβ2 in macrophage foam cells. Where examined, syndecan-4 {{has been identified as}} the HSPG critical for CCN1 functions. The CYR61 binding sites for some of these integrins have been mapped (Figure 1). Due to the cell type specificity of integrin expression, CYR61 acts through distinct integrins to mediate specific functions <b>in</b> <b>different</b> <b>types</b> of cells. For example, CYR61 induces angiogenic functions in endothelial cells through αvβ3, and in fibroblasts promotes cellular senescence and enables TNFα to induce apoptosis through binding to α6β1-HSPGs. However, CYR61 supports cell adhesion through all of the integrins identified above.|$|E
