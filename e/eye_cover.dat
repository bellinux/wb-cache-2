6000|$|Best of all are the fables {{that deal}} more {{immediately}} with the emotions. There is, for instance, that of [...] "The Two Travellers," [...] which is profoundly moving in conception, although {{by no means}} as well written as some others. In this, one of the two, fearfully frost-bitten, saves his life out of the snow {{at the cost of}} all that was comely in his body; just as, long before, the other, who has now quietly resigned himself to death, had violently freed himself from Love at the cost of all that was finest and fairest in his character. Very graceful and sweet is the fable (if so it should be called) in which the author sings the praises of that [...] "kindly perspective," [...] which lets a wheat-stalk near the <b>eye</b> <b>cover</b> twenty leagues of distant country, and makes the humble circle about a man's hearth more to him than all the possibilities of the external world. The companion fable to this is also excellent. It tells us of a man who had, all his life through, entertained a passion for certain blue hills on the far horizon, and had promised himself to travel thither ere he died, and become familiar with these distant friends. At last, in some political trouble, he is banished to the very place of his dreams. He arrives there overnight, and, when he rises and goes forth in the morning, there sure enough are the blue hills, only now they have changed places with him, and smile across to him, distant as ever, from the old home whence he has come. Such a story might have been very cynically treated; but it is not so done, the whole tone is kindly and consolatory, and the disenchanted man submissively takes the lesson, and understands that things far away are to be loved for their own sake, and that the unattainable is not truly unattainable, when we can make the beauty of it our own. Indeed, throughout all these two volumes, though there is much practical scepticism, and much irony on abstract questions, this kindly and consolatory spirit is never absent. There is much that is cheerful and, after a sedate, fireside fashion, hopeful. No one will be discouraged by reading the book; but the ground of all this hopefulness and cheerfulness remains to the end somewhat vague. It does not seem to arise from any practical belief in the future either of the individual or the race, but rather from the profound personal contentment of the writer. This is, I suppose, all we must look for in the case. It is {{as much as we can}} expect, if the fabulist shall prove a shrewd and cheerful fellow-wayfarer, one with whom the world does not seem to have gone much amiss, but who has yet laughingly learned something of its evil. It will depend much, of course, upon our own character and circumstances, whether the encounter will be agreeable and bracing to the spirits, or offend us as an ill-timed mockery. But where, as here, there is a little tincture of bitterness along with the good-nature, where it is plainly not the humour of a man cheerfully ignorant, but of one who looks on, tolerant and superior and smilingly attentive, upon the good and bad of our existence, it will go hardly if we do not catch some reflection of the same spirit to help us on our way. There is here no impertinent and lying proclamation of peace--none of the cheap optimism of the well-to-do; what we find here is a view of life that would be even grievous, were it not enlivened with this abiding cheerfulness, and ever and anon redeemed by a stroke of pathos.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of the research is {{to carry out the}} tests of binocular vision at esotropia postoperatively. The research was conducted on 58 examinees with esotropia that underwent operative treatment. Data used for this research were gathered from the illness history data of the patients treated at the Ward for Orthoptics and Pleoptics of the Eye disease Clinic of Tuzla University Clinic Centre. The examinees were between 3 and 14 years of age. The research included three periods of observation: initial examination, postoperative period and a year upon operation. The examinees were divided into two age groups, from 3 to 6 and from 7 to 14. Test variables included: age, visual acuity of right and left eye and binocular vision (simultaneous perception, fusion and stereoscopic vision). The following methods were used in this research: analysis of medical records, examination of visual acuity, refraction, ocular motility examination and ocular misalignment balance of the eye muscles, test coverage and detection of the <b>eye</b> (<b>cover</b> test), measuring objective deviation of objective angle of strabismus (the synoptophore with mandatory alternating occlusion before measuring the angle), examination of binocular vision (the synoptophore). The results indicate the need for the inclusion of children with strabismus in orthoptic-pleoptic treatment at an early age...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—Single optotype {{tests of}} visual acuity {{are widely used}} for {{preschool}} vision screening in order to optimise cooperation with testing. These tests may, however, underestimate the visual acuity deficit in amblyopia because they lack visual crowding. This study assessed the resultant negative predictive value (NPV) for amblyopia.  METHODS—Cohort study of 936  children in the Cambridge Health District selected by date of birth. The presence of amblyopia among children who had passed preschool vision screening was determined using Snellen line acuity as the reference test. Preschool vision screening was conducted at 3. 5  years of age by community orthoptists. The screening assessment comprised Sheridan-Gardiner single optotype test of visual acuity (referral criterion 6 / 9 or worse in either <b>eye),</b> <b>cover</b> test, ocular movements, 20 prism test, and TNO stereotest.  RESULTS—The overall NPV of preschool vision screening for amblyopia was 100 % (95 % CI 99. 4 % to 100 %). Most children with amblyopia were detected by the Sheridan-Gardiner single optotype test of visual acuity, but the other screening tests were necessary to prevent any false negatives. In isolation, the Sheridan-Gardiner single optotype test of visual acuity has a NPV for amblyopia of only 99. 6 % (95 % CI 98. 7 % to 99. 9 %).  CONCLUSION—Preschool vision screening using a single optotype test of visual acuity does achieve a high NPV for amblyopia, but only under certain conditions. These comprise a low threshold for referral (6 / 9 or worse in either eye) and {{the inclusion of a}} cover test and tests of binocular function in the screening assessment. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The authors {{examined}} vertical vergence in a Is-year-old {{girl with}} dissociated vertical deviation, a 60 convergent strabismus, no binocular vision, latent nystagmus, and a minimal left amblyopia. Eye movements were recorded during 4 s-periods of (1) both eyes open, alternated with 4 speriods of (2 a) right <b>eye</b> <b>covered,</b> (2 b) left <b>eye</b> <b>covered</b> or (2 C) both eyes closed. The patient preferred fixation {{with the right}} eye; when this <b>eye</b> was <b>covered,</b> the left <b>eye</b> took over fixation with an almost completely monocular, downward saccade (a horizontal saccade occurred at the same time). The right eye only made a very small saccade, and then started to drift upward with an exponentially decreasing velocity. Enright has shown that fast convergence or divergence may occur when a horizontal saccade is performed at the same time. Similarly, the authors suspected that, in their patient, vertical vergence was facilitated by the horizontal saccade that resulted, in this case of horizontal strabismus, from alternation of fixation. To examine whether this was the case, they compensated for the horizontal strabismus by placing a 30 prism-dioptre base-out prism {{in front of the}} left eye (the patient had no binocular vision). With the prism in place, the horizontal saccade that occurred when the right <b>eye</b> was <b>covered</b> was smaller, and only little vertical vergence occurred together with the horizontal saccade. It seems possible that vertical vergence is also facilitated by horizontal saccades...|$|R
