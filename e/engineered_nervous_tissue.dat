40|$|The {{possibility}} to generate dopaminergic (DA) neurons from {{pluripotent stem cells}} represents an unlimited source of material for tissue engineering and cell therapy for neurodegenerative disease. We set up a protocol based on the generation of size-calibrated neurospheres for a rapid production (3 weeks) of a high amount of DA neurons (> 60 %) oriented toward a midbrain-like phenotype, characterized by the expression of FOXA 2, LMX 1 A, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), NURR 1, and EN 1. By using γ-secretase inhibitors and varying culture time of neurospheres, we controlled maturation and cellular composition of a three-dimensional (3 D) <b>engineered</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue</b> (ENT). ENT contained neurons and glial cells expressing various markers of maturity, such as synaptophysin, neuronal nuclei-specific protein (NeuN), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and were electrophysiologically active. We found that 3 -week-old neurospheres were optimal to generate 3 D tissue containing DA neurons with typical A 9 morphology. ENT generated from 4 -week-old neurospheres launched glial cell type since astrocytes and myelin could be detected massively {{at the expense of}} TH-immunoreactive neurons. All γ-secretase inhibitors were not equivalent; compound E was more efficient than DAPT in generating DA neurons. This DA tissue provides a tool for drug screening, and toxicology. It should also become a useful biomaterial for studies on Parkinson's disease...|$|E

40|$|Although {{peripheral}} nerve injury is a common consequence of trauma or surgery, there are insufficient means for repair. In particular, there is a critical need for improved methods to facilitate regeneration of axons across major nerve lesions. Here, we <b>engineered</b> transplantable living <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue</b> constructs to provide a labeled pathway to guide host axonal regeneration. These constructs consisted of stretch-grown, longitudinally aligned living axonal tracts inserted into poly(glycolic acid) tubes. The constructs (allogenic) were transplanted to bridge an excised segment of sciatic nerve in the rat, and histological analyses were performed at 6 and 16 weeks posttransplantation to determine graft survival, integration, and host regeneration. At both time points, the transplanted constructs {{were found to have}} maintained their pretransplant geometry, with surviving clusters of graft neuronal somata at the extremities of the constructs spanned by tracts of axons. Throughout the transplanted region, there was an intertwining plexus of host and graft axons, suggesting that the transplanted axons mediated host axonal regeneration across the lesion. By 16 weeks posttransplant, extensive myelination of axons was observed throughout the transplant region. Further, graft neurons had extended axons beyond the margins of the transplanted region, penetrating into the host nerve. Notably, this survival and integration of the allogenic constructs occurred in the absence of immunosuppression therapy. These findings demonstrate the promise of living tissue-engineered axonal constructs to bridge major nerve lesions and promote host regeneration, potentially by providing axon-mediated axonal outgrowth and guidance...|$|R
50|$|At this stage, schistosomula feed on <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue</b> as {{demonstrated}} by detection of oligodendrocytes and neurons in the lumen of parasite’s intestine. A cysteine peptidase cathepsin B1 of T. regenti (TrCB1) localised in intestines of migrating schistosomula is capable of myelin basic protein degradation, thus probably serving for <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue</b> digestion. Nonetheless, the <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue</b> ingestion has likely only a minor pathogenic effect on the host central <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue.</b> This is underpinned by observations of leg paralysis only in immunocompromised hosts, whereas in experiments with immunocompetent mouse strains, the infected animals did not reveal any neurological disorders. The neurological symptoms originate probably in mechanical damage of the <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue</b> leading to dystrophic or even necrotic changes of neurons and axonal injury. The cause of it is large migrating schistosomula (approximately 340×80 μm) which are not destroyed by proper immune response.|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS The {{operative}} specimens from 160 {{cases of}} {{spina bifida cystica}} were examined in detail.

In the more severe forms of spina bifida cystica in which the spinal cord or nerves extend into the sac (meningomyelocele) or are exposed on the skin sur-face (myelocele), minute heterotopic nests of glial tissue with or without ependymal canals are fre-quently found in the surrounding meninges or sub-cutaneous tissues (Lichtenstein, 1940; Cameron, 1957).

40|$|The {{study of}} {{neurochemistry}} {{has tended to}} follow two main pathways.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{described a}} new procedure to grow <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue</b> as organotypic culture. The main feature of these slice cultures {{is to maintain}} a well preserved, three-dimensional organisation of the central <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue.</b> As these cultures can be kept for several weeks (up to three months), we have used this in vitro approach to study the complex interactions between host tissue and parasites during late stages of cerebral African trypanosomiasis. Light and electron microscopical studies, as well as electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that the structure and function of the <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue</b> is not severely affected even after several weeks of trypanosome infection. The presence {{of a large number}} of parasites does not seem to be deleterious to neuronal survival. Secondly, most of the trypanosomes are located around the periphery of the <b>nervous</b> <b>tissue,</b> but many of them also penetrate into the nervous parenchyma. Thirdly, trypanosomes with well-conserved morphology are found within the cytoplasm of glial cells, which in some cases were identified as astrocytes. These "intracellular parasites" seem to actively invade the target cells. Our study demonstrates that the presence of proliferating trypanosomes does not per se interfere with the neural activity of CNS tissues.
