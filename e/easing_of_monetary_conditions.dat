40|$|Given low {{interest}} rates in the large industrial countries and buoyant capital inflows into the emerging markets East Asian central banks have accumulated large stocks of foreign reserves. As the resulting <b>easing</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> has become a threat to domestic price and financial stability, the East Asian central banks have embarked on substantial sterilization operations to absorb what we call ‘surplus liquidity ’ from the domestic banking systems. This has brought the East Asian central banks into debtor positions versus the domestic banking systems. We show based on a central bank loss function that given buoyant capital inflows and exchange rate stabilization the absorption of surplus liquidity leads either to financial repression, or rising inflation or both. Assuming that a debtor central bank moved towards a freely floating exchange rate to gain monetary policy independence, we show that monetary policy independence is undermined by sterilization costs and revaluation losses on foreign reserves...|$|E

By contrast, the interpretation offered here assigns a key role to demand-side factors as the driving force behind the recovery in output and employment growth.

40|$|Monetary {{policy has}} {{steadily}} become tighter {{over the past}} twelve months. In various statements, the Government has indicated its view that monetary policy needs to be tight in order to subdue an 'excessively high' {{rate of growth of}} domestic demand. This article asks whether the current stance of monetary policy is now too restrictive and, if so, what the consequences might be for the pattern and growth of economic activity during 1989 - 90. A number of scenarios based on alternative settings of monetary policy in 1989 - 90 are derived from a short-term simulation model of the Australian economy. The scenarios suggest that, if monetary policy remains at the current degree of tightness, the Australian economy may well experience a recession in 1989 - 90. Some <b>easing</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> is mandatory if a sharp and unnecessary slowdown of economic activity is to be avoided.

40|$|The {{sizeable}} {{fiscal consolidation}} required {{to stabilize the}} debt-to-GDP ratios in several countries {{in the aftermath of}} the global crisis raises a crucial question on its feasibility. To answer this question, we rely on historical evidence from a sample of 91 adjustment episodes of countries during 1945 – 2012 that needed and wanted to adjust in order to stabilize debt to GDP. We find that, in at least half the cases, countries improved their cyclically adjusted primary balances by close to 5 percent of GDP. We also observe that, while countries typically make substantial efforts to stabilize debt, once this objective is achieved, they tend to ease their primary balances and do not necessarily get back to their initial lower debt-to-GDP ratio. We find that consolidations tended to be larger when the initial deficit was high and adjustment efforts were sustained over time. Fiscal adjustments also tended to be larger when accompanied by an <b>easing</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and, to a lesser extent, by an improvement in credit conditions...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the macroeconomic implications of rising government debt in Canada and the short-run costs and long-run benefits of stemming the rise. The discussion {{begins with an}} evaluation of the long-run consequences of increasing government indebtedness, first based on the simple arithmetic of the government's long-run budget constraint, and then based on simulations of the Bank of Canada's main model of the Canadian economy, which incorporates several channels through which government debt may affect real economic activity. The principal conclusion is that the main economic cost of higher government debt is a lower sustainable level of domestic consumption. Simulations with the full dynamic model highlight the trade-off of short-run loss for long-run gain presented by deficit reduction. There are important short-run costs of stemming a rise in debt. However, the results of this paper show that substantial net gains are obtained from doing so, since the present value of the permanent long-term gains in consumption far outweigh these short-term costs. The simulations also suggest that a fiscal contraction would require an <b>easing</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> relative to what they would have otherwise been to maintain an inflation target. ...|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{considers}} the monetary and fiscal policies appropriate to Europe {{under the circumstances}} of an adverse international cycle and a weak euro. Typically, governments have medium-term plans for fiscal consolidation, “stabilisation plans”, calling for a falling trend in budget deficits. The European Commission has called for this trend to be sustained and argued that the ECB should provide the necessary value-stimulus by cutting interest rates further. On the other hand Euro area interest rates are already lower than would be expected {{on the basis of}} the evolution of prices and output, and an indicator based on interest and exchange rates also indicates considerable <b>easing</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> throughout 2001. It would be appropriate for deficits to rise throughout Europe during the current cyclical downturn, except where stabilisation efforts have been weakest, and debt income ratios are also highest, and even there they should not decline. We also believe that (especially as compared to the US Fed) the ECB has room to cut interest rates further – a measure which should be adopted sooner rather than later. It may also be appropriate to consider a contingency plan for a more radical and co-ordinated policy throughout Europe. ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>Monetary</b> <b>Conditions</b> Index (MCI) is {{a concept}} with a twofold use in the {{analysis}} <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> and in the development <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> policy strategies. The idea of this concept is that (real) interest rates are not a sufficient indicator for <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> in rather small and open economies. Apart from interest rates, exchange rates also have a sig-nificant influence on <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> Therefore, the MCI combines interest rates and exchange rates to a single measurement <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> within an economy. The MCI can be employed to measure conditions in order to evaluate monetary policy in an early stage and to give a guideline to policy makers to set their instruments and operating targets accord-ing to target final objectives such as inflation targets. The paper provides a brief introduction into {{the concept of the}} MCI and focuses on the estimation of the respective parameters of this index concept for South Africa. The estimated weights of the MCI suggest that changes of real interest rates have a 1. 9 times higher influence on <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> than changes in real exchange rates.

40|$|Sharp {{increases}} {{in the price of}} oil are generally seen as a major contributor to business cycle asymmetries. Moreover, the very recent highs registered in the world oil market are causing concern about possible slowdowns in the economic performance of the most developed countries. In this paper a structural cointegrated VAR model has been considered for the G- 7 countries in order to study the direct effects of oil price shocks on output and prices, and the reaction of monetary variables to external shocks. Our results can be summarized as follows: i) a stationary money demand, as suggested by the classic theory of money, can be identified for most countries; ii) according to the estimated coefficients of the structural part of the model, for all countries except Japan and U. K. the null hypothesis of an influence of oil prices on the inflation rate cannot be rejected. Inflation rate shocks are transmitted to the real economy by increasing interest rates; iii) impulse response analysis suggests, for most countries, the existence of an instantaneous, temporary effect of oil price innovations on prices; iv) impulse response functions indicate different monetary policy reactions to inflationary and growth shocks; v) the simulation exercises directed to estimate the total impact of the 1990 oil price shock indicate that for some countries (U. S.) {{a significant part of the}} effects of the oil price shock is due to the monetary policy reaction function. For other countries (Canada, France and Italy), however, the total impact is offset, at least in part, by an <b>easing</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Central {{banks have}} won in {{credibility}} {{as from the}} mid-eighties by keeping inflation under control. However, confidence in low inflation might have encouraged agents to excessive risk-taking, leading asset prices to rise. Moreover, the belief in a Federal Reserve guarantee against a sharp market decline spread across US markets as from the nineties. This belief, {{commonly referred to as}} the Greenspan put, raised again the question about the role of asset prices in monetary policy decisions. The problem is addressed by modeling the reaction of the Fed to stockmarket deviations from fundamentals over the period stretching from August 1987 to October 2008, which corresponds to the periods where Greenspan until January 2006 and Bernanke from thereon were chairmen. A Taylor rule describing the Fed's nominal feedback rule to inflation and economic activity on a monthly basis is extended to take account of asset prices. The indicators considered are deflation and volatility in stock prices. Furthermore, a Markov switching process allows to capture contemporaneous as well as forward-looking monetary policy responses to asset prices over the period. We find out that taking asset price deflation improves the Taylor rule fit by some 8 %. In periods when the Fed was actively pursuing an expansive or restrictive monetary policy, its reaction to volatility or deflation of financial markets was significant. We also see that the reaction of the Fed to asset prices was greater during financial crises, especially when modeling a forward-looking decision process. Agents' confidence in a stronger response of the US central bank to significant market declines urging to an <b>easing</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions</b> in their favour was therefore not unfounded. monetary policy, nominal feedback rule, asset prices, United States...|$|E
40|$|From 1995 to 2001 Russia {{witnessed}} {{an asset}} market boom, a deep financial crisis, and a surprisingly forceful recovery. This paper analyzes economic policy and {{data of the}} time to explain why fluctuations were so violent and to draw lessons for Emerging Markets investors {{as well as for}} policymakers. The evidence suggests that the boom in Russian asset prices in 1995 - 1997 resulted from a highly ambitious monetary stabilization program amidst favourable global conditions. Inflation was compressed faster than in advanced transition economies, at the expense of rapid real appreciation and a persistent need for capital inflows. Weak economic structures and the lack of broad political support hampered fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, however. This made the monetary stabilization program vulnerable. Moreover, the program did not provide a politically viable exit option. Therefore, after external shocks had eroded the sustainability of the exchange rate target in 1998, the authorities felt compelled to defend it as long as possible. The ultimate crisis escalation resulted in a partial government default and steep devaluation. However, the economy responded with relief to the crisis-related <b>easing</b> <b>of</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>conditions.</b> The latter outweighed the drag from a collapse in capital imports. Also, the crisis escalation united the political spectrum around a new fundamental consensus on economic policy. Post- crisis governments prioritized fiscal consolidation over disinflation. This reduced dependence on foreign capital and made overall stabilization robust to external shocks. The more stable political and economic environment spurred economic reform in 2000 - 2001, particularly in the areas of public finances and investment conditions. Together with persistent commitment towards international integration this heralds a convergence of Russia’s economic structures with those in Central and Western Europe.

40|$|To {{cope with}} {{competitive}} pressures and market forces within the EU in the medium-term, the SEE 6 needs to address important challenges through determined implementation of structural reforms. Progress with structural reforms can help for macroeconomic stability, for example, {{by reducing the}} structural external deficits. Also it helps nominal convergence, as the productivity realizes the improvement of competitiveness and helps disinflation by maintaining low unit cost. So in terms of macroeconomic convergence for SEE 6 countries and the case of Macedonia, EU membership requires convergence of the Macedonian economy {{with that of the}} EU in realistic conditions, indicating income per capita and economic structure, and in nominal terms, meaning convergence of prices, inflation and interest rates. Because of the fact that Southeastern European countries rely mainly on exchange rate anchors to reduce inflation, the appreciation of the real exchange rate among countries in the region is significant, although it is slightly lower when compared to countries in the EU member states. As a result, these countries suffer from loss of competitiveness. This can be clearly seen from the movements of the deficit on their current account, which are important in all these countries. Using the exchange rate as anchor for inflationary expectations, on long run have been effective so far, producing a low and stable inflation rates. However, in periods of low inflation and deflationary pressures, exchange rate anchors do not allow sufficient space for fiscal and monetary stimulus. In this respect, policy makers are under following dilemma: to deviate from exchange rate anchor and increase the space for fiscal and monetary stimulus; to accelerate structural reforms and competitiveness and on short run deepen the recessionary pressures; and to increase foreign debt and thus increase scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus while preserving the exchange rate anchor. All three scenarios are analyzed in this paper. Economic policies can be instrumental for growth in the near- and the medium-term in SEE 6. On the fiscal side, sustained reform effort is needed to address structural rigidities in the budgets of SEE 6. Priorities include: changes in the composition of public expenditure toward investment and away from wages, public expenditure targeting and prioritization as well as improvements in revenue collection and the broadening of the tax base, among others.

40|$|Globalization {{brings the}} threat of a {{weakened}} SME sector, since its role in (direct) exporting is less than proportional to its size, and in the same time it can also increase the importance of a strong SME sector. The recommendations are on building relationships with financial institutions, especially with banks, to facilitate funding to SMEs. In this context, it is useful to identify where SMEs are dealing in foreign currency and seek opportunities to provide value-adding advice in areas such as managing foreign exchange risks and forecasting currency needs. The key factors for realization of these aims are innovation and knowledge that would help for increasing competitiveness with support of real exchange rate by stimulating the growth of export, too. This can contribute for sustainability of the economic growth and economic integration especially of small economies on which this paper is mainly focused with special emphasis on Macedonia.
