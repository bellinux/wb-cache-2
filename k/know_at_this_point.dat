He comes out of the flashback just in time to sound the alert for a lunar tremor that, thanks to his prompt action, kills only two of his fellow crew members. He remembers his dead dog, realizing that Laika could not actually have saved him, for she was separated by 5 years time and a barrier that no man or dog could ever bridge (her death). It was his never sleeping subconscious mind, sensing the tremors, that knew how to wake him, by making him dream of Laika's barking as she did in the earlier earthquake. Thus ending on the idea of the supernatural bond between the narrator and Laika.|$|E

There is concern that the minimum tariff is excessive because the brain of a 15-year-old is not mature, neuroscientists do not currently understand fully how the brain matures during adolescence and rates of maturity vary between individuals. Deborah Orr wrote: At 15 or 16, a human brain is far from fully developed. The volatility of teenagers is partly a consequence of the accelerated neural sculpting that goes on in these years. (...) Cornick - or any person who commits a crime at 15 years of age - is not a fully developed human being. The man serving Cornick’s sentences will have a materially different brain and mind from the boy who committed the crime. Child criminals should be treated differently to adult criminals for this reason. (...)

5000|$|There is {{some debate}} over where the song begins within the {{narrative}} of the movie.

As she sings this, she angrily shoves his gun into his hands, implying that that European attitude towards guns, violence, and racism is far more savage than the views that the Native Americans have. Pocahontas then tells John Smith {{that there is a lot}} about the Earth he doesn't <b>know.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> it is considered that the song actually begins. The first line of the chorus tells of the wolf crying to the [...] "blue corn moon", with the second line varying with the verse context. The phrase [...] "blue corn moon" [...] has no actual meaning in Native American folklore. It was made up by lyricist Stephen Schwartz because he liked the sound of it, being inspired by a Native American love poem that read [...] "I will come to you in the moon of green corn". [...] The second time the chorus is sung in the single version, the second line becomes [...] "Or let the eagle tell you where he's been" [...] since the film version only has the one chorus already mentioned. The third line tells of singing with the voices of the mountains, as the fourth line concludes with the title imagery of painting with the colors of the wind.|$|E

That haunted her. What she did not <b>know</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> <b>point,</b> was that her captivity {{was coming to an}} end. Her father's desperate efforts to find her had finally begun to pay off. He had located Comancheros who were willing to go and trade for her, and his instructions were to ransom her at any cost. The Comanches were camped north of Santa Fe when they were approached by Comancheros who wanted to ransom Rachel in accordance with the instructions of her father. [...] She wrote in her book of the agony of believing that the traders had not offered enough to buy her freedom - and her not knowing that in fact, they were simply trying to get the best bargain, because her father had told them to pay any price, no matter how high, to rescue her. She was sold to them on June 19, 1837. Her rescue had been arranged by Colonel and Mrs. William Donaho, acting for the Parker family, and to whom she was delivered in Santa Fe after a journey of 17 days. Two weeks after her arrival, the Donahos, fearing trouble as the native population of Santa Fe was in virtual rebellion, fled some 800 mi to Independence, Missouri, with Rachel with them. Three months later, Rachel's brother-in-law, Lorenzo D. Nixon, escorted her back to Texas, since her father was still out in the Comancherio searching for her. She was reunited with her husband on February 19, 1838, nearly two years after the Fort Parker Massacre. She was gaunt to the point of near starvation, covered with scars and sores, and in very poor health.|$|E

40|$|Automatic {{cognitive}} processing {{helps us}} navigate the world. However, if {{the emotional and}} cognitive interplay becomes skewed, those cognitive processes can become maladaptive and result in psychopathology. Although biases are present in most mental disorders, different disorders are characterized by biased processing in different cognitive domains, e. g., attention is changed in anxiety and memory in depression. Psychological treatments can indirectly (i. e., cognitive behavioral therapy) or directly (e. g., cognitive bias modification; mindfulness; metacognitive therapy) change biased cognitive processes. The fast majority of studies on cognitive processes and therapy are done in anxiety and depression, {{and to a lesser}} extent in addiction. There is evidence that (1) psychological treatments change cognitive processing styles and (2) that this change is a working mechanism of the different treatments.
