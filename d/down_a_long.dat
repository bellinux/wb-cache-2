5|$|In {{the ending}} cutscene, Keil and the dragon enter the tower. While {{traveling}} <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> corridor, the dragon surrounds Keil in a force field, lifting {{him from the}} saddle and suspending him in the hallway. Keil watches as the dragon continues on {{to the core of}} the tower, then a blinding light is seen and the tower explodes. Keil wakes up some time later in a desert area abutting the ocean. Looking down, he sees the foot prints of the blue dragon around him, indicating that after the explosion, the dragon carried him to safety and flew away.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{running back}} Dwayne Thomas gained nine {{yards on the}} first Tech play, then the Hokies earned their initial first down on an option run that gained three yards. After the first down, Druckenmiller threw an {{incomplete}} pass, then Thomas ran for a six-yard gain. On third <b>down,</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> pass downfield was knocked down by a Texas defender, and the Hokies punted back to Texas. The kick was fair caught at the 13-yard line, but Tech was penalized 15 yards for interfering with the catch.|$|E
5|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Danielle Federici, was filmed {{during the early}} summer of 1994. It was filmed in black-and-white, and features Carey walking along the streets of New York, watching several different people, ranging from a small child to an elderly man, lonely {{and in need of}} a friend. Additionally, aside from several scenes of Carey and a large church choir in a large antechamber, the video is known as the first video in which Carey appears with straightened hair. Throughout her career up until that point, Carey had famously sported long, auburn curls. However, the video presented Carey's first image makeover, where she appears with bangs and a long straightened hairstyle. The video begins with scenes of Carey walking <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> New York street, with the addition of close ups of Carey's face. As she stares down the road, she witnesses a small girl, sitting alone in an alley corner, glaring into the sky. As the first chorus begins, Carey enters a large foyer, with a choir dressed in black singing perched atop a large staircase. During the second verse, she similarly witnesses an older man, who is sitting on a withered stoop.|$|E

25|$|The Battle of Lundby {{happened}} {{south of}} Lundby in northeast Himmerland on 3 July 1864 in the Second War of Schleswig. A Danish {{company of the}} First Regiment tried a head-on bayonet charge <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> hillside, but stopped 20 meters {{in front of the}} earth dike that the Prussians lay in cover behind. This battle was the last in the Second War of Schleswig, and resulted in great Danish losses.|$|E
25|$|The Memorial park {{is a small}} keyhole shaped area {{located on}} the aptly named 'Canadalaan' on the {{southwest}} fringe of Passendale village. Fittingly, maple trees and a hedge of holly line {{the edges of the}} park and well kept lawns and stone pathways surround the low circular flagstone terrace that the granite memorial block rests on. From the centre of the memorial grounds one can look up the Canadalaan to see the rebuilt church of Passendale and in the opposite direction, <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> avenue of trees, the rebuilt spires of Ypres.|$|E
25|$|Field of 1000 Screams {{was first}} {{introduced}} in the 2007 Scarefest event {{and was the first}} maze at Alton Towers not situated inside a pre-existing building. The Field was located entirely outdoors in a moderately sized field of maize, which had to be planted especially for the event several months earlier. It purported to be a fictional village called Altonville that had become overrun by zombies. Visitors walked <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> pathway cut through the corn, and encountered characters and scares along the way, before the finale took place. The Field of 1000 Screams did not return for the 2010 event.|$|E

25|$|Sauron {{is shown}} to have bred his own Uruk-hai, known as Black Uruks. They can be seen when Frodo is {{captured}} by the orcs of Cirith Ungol and his mithril shirt leads to a confrontation between Shagrat, a Black Uruk of Mordor, and an orc from Minas Morgul called Gorbag. Gorbag threatens to stab Shagrat if he tries to steal the shirt, but he tosses it aside and throws Gorbag <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> flight of stairs, where he falls on top of several other Uruk-hai. A huge brawl between orcs and Uruk-hai spreads all over the fortress, allowing Sam to enter the tower with ease.|$|E
500|$|The {{final stage}} of the race left from the {{location}} of the previous stage's finish, Saint-Gervais-les-Bains, for a [...] route. After the riders climbed a [...] rise from the start, they went <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> descent with the second-category Côte d'Héry-sur-Ugine in the middle. The terrain remained flat until the fourth-category Côte d’Aiton, [...] in. This was followed by the third-category Côte de Saint-Georges-d'Hurtières. A further flat section placed the riders {{at the foot of the}} first-category Lacets de Montvernier. After the subsequent descent began a long gradual incline to the climb of the third-category Côte de Saint-André. A small descent took the race to Modane and the ascent to the summit finish at the Valfréjus ski resort; the length of the climb was [...] with an average gradient of 5.7%.|$|E
500|$|The Dodgers were an {{improving}} team in Stengel's {{first years}} with them, {{and he was}} greatly influenced by the manager who joined the team in 1914, Wilbert Robinson. Stengel also avoided a holdout in 1914; Dodgers owner Charlie Ebbets was anxious to put his players under contract lest they jump to the new Federal League, and nearly doubled Stengel's salary to $4,000 per year. During spring training, the Dodgers faced the minor league Baltimore Orioles and their rookie, Babe Ruth, who pitched. Ruth hit a triple over Stengel's head but gave up two doubles to him, and Stengel chased <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> Ruth fly ball to right in the Dodgers' loss. Both Brooklyn and Stengel started the season slowly, but both recovered with a hot streak that left the Dodgers only 4 games under [...]500, their best record since 1903, and Stengel finished with a [...]316 batting average, fifth best in the league. His on-base percentage led the league at [...]404, though this was not yet an official statistic. With the Federal League still active, Stengel was rewarded with a two-year contract at $6,000 per year.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E
2500|$|The {{village of}} North Stoke, now {{much smaller than}} in {{previous}} centuries, sits opposite South Stoke — with which it is linked by a [...] path across the River Arun.

2500|$|On October 1944, the 1st Battalion, 141st Infantry of the 36th Division, made a push <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> heavily-wooded ridge that {{extended}} southeast and dominated {{the valley of}} Bruyeres, France from Biffontaine to La Houssiere. [...] The 1st had overextended itself behind enemy lines and had been cut off by strong enemy forces. The 442nd, {{under the leadership of}} Lieutenant Colonel Miller, was ordered into the line of combat in an effort to relieve pressure on the 1st Battalion.|$|E

2500|$|It was an {{incredible}} camera setup. We rehearsed two days. The camera followed Greenstreet and Bogart from one room into another, then <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> hallway and finally into a living room; there the camera moved {{up and down in}} what is referred to as a boom-up and boom-down shot, then panned from left to right and back to Bogart's drunken face; the next pan shot was to Greenstreet's massive stomach from Bogart's point of view. ... One miss and we had to begin all over again.|$|E
2500|$|The video {{begins by}} Sheena {{walking down the}} draws of a wardrobe, and singing the song in an {{extensive}} dressing room, {{as well as a}} stage. The video depicts her wearing eight different early 20th Century costumes, usually in scenes involving dressing mirrors. During the instrumental section of the song, Sheena performs a dance with her bandmates serving as back-dancers. Additional scenes involve Sheena playing golf, and sitting on a bed of sand. During the final English section of the song, Sheena walks <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> flight of wardrobe draws ...|$|E
2500|$|According to {{the series}} director, Mitsuo Iso, a major theme in Dennō Coil is the {{distance}} between the characters, such as Yūko's inability to feel the fur of her own virtual pet, in addition to all the relational tensions and divides of understanding between the characters in the series. [...] In Iso's translated words, it conveys how [...] "there will always be a distance between people, and even between things that seem within ones' reach. And that one must walk <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> thin and winding road before they reach one's heart. There are tons of obstacles. It's in fact like the roads in towns of old." ...|$|E

2500|$|The game {{ends with}} Travis being {{attacked}} by another assassin before Henry saves him, and challenges him to one last fight. It is during this fight that Henry reveals two twists: first, that he is Travis's twin brother, and second, that Sylvia is his wife (which would make her Travis' sister-in-law), and has a habit of disappearing before returning with lots of money (presumably due to conning people). [...] Still locked in combat, the brothers discuss {{the nature of these}} revelations and their situation while they run <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> street. Finally, as the two leap towards each other for the final clash, the screen flashes and is revealed to be a painting hanging in an art gallery, where a little girl, Jeane, and her mother, Sylvia, are observing it.|$|E
2500|$|Water {{flows through}} the {{aqueduct}} {{in a series of}} abrupt rises and gradual falls. The water flows <b>down</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> segment, built at a slight grade, and arrives at a pumping station powered by Path 66 or Path 15. The pumping station raises the water, where it again gradually flows downhill to the next station. However, where there are substantial drops, the water's potential energy is recaptured by hydroelectric plants. The initial pumping station fed by the Sacramento River Delta raises the water , while a series of pumps culminating at the Edmonston Pumping Plant raises the water [...] over the Tehachapi Mountains. The Edmonston Pumping station requires so much power that several power lines off Path 15 and Path 26 are needed to ensure proper operation of the pumps.|$|E
2500|$|The monumental facade on Eighth Avenue was {{conceived}} as a Corinthian colonnade braced at the end by two pavilions.

An unbroken flight of steps {{the full length of}} the colonnade provides access, for the main floor devoted to customer services is above a functional basement level that rises out of a dry moat giving light and air to workspaces below. Each of the square end pavilions is capped with a low saucer dome, expressed on the exterior as a low stepped pyramid.
