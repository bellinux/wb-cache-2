50|$|A shunt turn is {{the term}} for a <b>duty</b> <b>covered</b> <b>by</b> a {{shunting}} locomotive. Some shunt turns would have included trips between yards (known as transfer freights). Turns would have varied through the years with some being 24-hour and others only for certain hours of the day. This section is being researched, {{but this is an}} indicative list of the locations around the York area where shunting locomotives would have worked. In 2012 York has no allocation of mainline shunting locomotives - any shunting is generally done by the train locomotive. The National Railway Museum does possess a Class 08 shunting locomotive and has used Class 02 and Class 03 locomotives for this duty in the past.|$|R

After interrogating him {{with the use of}} the Amazons' golden lasso, Hippolyta decides he is not an enemy of the Amazons and as such, tradition dictates that an emissary be tasked to ensure his safe return to his own country. Diana volunteers, but is assigned to guard Ares's cell instead since her mother argues that she has not enough experience in dealing with the dangers of the outside world.

40|$|AbstractGiven a space M, {{a family}} of sets A of a space X is <b>ordered</b> <b>by</b> M if A=AK:K is a compact subset of M and K⊂L implies AK⊂AL. We study the class M of spaces which have compact <b>covers</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>by</b> a second {{countable}} space.

Under MA(ω 1), if X is compact and (X×X) has a compact <b>cover</b> <b>ordered</b> <b>by</b> a Polish space then X is metrizable; here Δ=(x,x) :x∈X is the diagonal of the space X.

We also consider the class M⁎ of spaces X which have a compact <b>cover</b> F <b>ordered</b> <b>by</b> a second countable space with the additional property that, for every compact set P⊂X there exists F∈F with P⊂F.

50|$|The {{original}} Bill {{was introduced}} in the Scottish Parliament on 8 March 2000 by Tavish Scott MSP.

[...] Matthew O'Reilly argued the order's penalties were in fact more lenient than those to which deserters {{would otherwise have been}} subject under military law.
