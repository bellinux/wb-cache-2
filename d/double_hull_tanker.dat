Disincentives for fleet {{replacement}} and modernization: Since the Oil Pollution Act {{holds the}} vessel owners fully liable, {{it has created}} a disincentive for oil companies to transport crude oil in their vessels and for charterers to transport their oil on the most suitable vessels. Many financially successful oil companies select the highest quality of ships to transport their products, however, other companies continue to transport their product on the lower quality, older vessels due to the cheaper costs. The majority of charterers refuse {{to pay more for}} higher grade vessels despite the liability and compensation regulations enforced by OPA. The new and safer <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> vessels are approximately 15-20% more costly to operate. In 1992, approximately 60% of global vessels was at least fifteen years old or older. The major oil companies are still delaying the fleet replacement requirement of retiring single hull vessels mandated by OPA. For example, Exxon and Texaco have delayed the replacement of their single hull vessels for new double hulled ships. However, companies like Chevron and Mobil have ordered two new double hull tankers. Leading by example, other independent shipping companies to invest in new double hull tankers as well. Despite the change from single to double tanker vessels, it is still not sufficient enough to accommodate the needs of the oil industry. It is expected that over the next decade there will be a serious lack of suitable tonnage to meet the expected demand for newer vessels. It is estimated that the global oil industry must invest approximately 200-350 billion dollars to meet global demands for new and environmentally sound vessels.|$|E

40|$|Hull-girder {{residual}} strength after grounding was investigated for four double hull tankers, three bulk carriers and one single hull VLCC. It is {{noted that the}} loss of section modulus (to the deck and to the bottom) and the loss of ultimate strength (sagging and hogging conditions) are approximately proportional to the transverse damage extent in bottom. Such relationships, when expressed as dimensionless form, do not seem to depend on the ship’s length, but are different for different types of ships. The ship’s speed that results in a given bottom damage extent in a grounding accident is predicted using a simplified analytical method. The influential effects of ship’s speed on the {{residual strength}} of hull-girder are shown. It is revealed that when damaged to a same percent of the ship’s breadth, a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> and a bulk carrier have comparable hull-girder residual strength, and are better than a single hull tanker. If sailing at a specific speed and running aground, a single hull tanker will have a residual hull-girder strength that is comparable to a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> of a similar size which loses outer skin only.

40|$|AbstractShip {{grounding}} is {{a hazard}} which requires enormous caution when occurs. No matter how secure a grounded ship may appear, {{she is in}} a dangerous position. In most cases, rapid refloating is desirable to remove the ship from a place of danger, to reduce stress on the hull and to decrease the risk of pollution. The usual action taken is reducing the weight of the ship, which requires the help of salvage team and consequently causes high cost. Another alternative is weight transfer from tank to tank until ship refloats; this has to be done with extensive not to cause double loss. This paper proposes practical support that would help the captain make the right decisions at the moment of the casualty. The plan is summarized in a chart which gives direction to the captain how to refloat the ship by transferring weight from cargo tanks to ballast tanks. Since the ship strength is of major concern, strength check is included in the plan. The proposed Grounding Contingency Plan “GCP” for intact <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> is suggested to be prepared in design to facilitate the decision making for the captain and indicates the direction of action to minimize the risk...|$|E
40|$|A {{procedure}} {{is presented to}} perform a second order reliability-based structural analysis of the mid ship section of a vessel. The procedure accounts for {{the combination of the}} vertical and horizontal components of the wave induced bending moment {{as well as of the}} still water bending moment, in order to determine the actual angle gamma formed with the vertical plane by the total resultant bending moment. The ultimate strength of the midship section is considered as a function of the same angle. The proposed analysis is applied to a <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker</b> on a particular route (Persic Gulf - North Europe and ballast return trip) and directional scatter diagrams are used for the description of the sea states encountered during the voyage. The results are compared to those obtained on the same test case with a simpler model, which takes into account only the vertical components of loads and strength. The comparison shows that the introduction in the load model of the horizontal component of the bending moment does not reduce the structural reliability of the considered oil tanker ship. Such result is to be related to the shape of the curve of hull girder ultimate strength as a function of gamma, which shows a local minimum for pure vertical bending moment: in the examined case, the most dangerous condition is obtained in such situation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} is to assess the ultimate hull girder strength of grounding damaged under longitudinal bending.

The Finite Element Method is used to assess the ultimate hull girder strength including their behavior both single hull bulk carrier and <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> oil <b>tanker.</b> The grounding damage is simply cretaed by removing the element component from the bottom part. Two cases of grounding damage are observed, those are center part and the asymmetric position. For the simple calculation, one-frame space is considered for the longitudinal damage extent in longitudinal direction, and the cross-section of single hull bulk carrier and <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> oil <b>tanker</b> are taken. The transversal damage extent is taken to be equal with the percentage of ship breadth and the vertical damage extent is equal or less than the height of double bottom structure.

40|$|It is {{necessary}} to develop an efficient optimization technique to perform optimum designs which have given design spaces, discrete design values and several design goals. As optimization techniques, direct search method and stochastic search method are widely used in designing of ship structures.

And the merit of the stochastic search method is to obtain the global optimum points well by spreading points randomly entire the design spaces.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decades {{there have been}} many losses of the {{merchant}} vessels due to either accidents or exposure to large environmentally induced forces. The potential for the structural capability degrading effects of both corrosion and fatigue induced cracks are profoundly important and must be fully understood and reflected in vessel’s inspection and maintenance programme. Corrosion has been studied and quantified by many researchers, however its effect on structural integrity is still subject to uncertainty, particularly with regards to localized corrosion. The present study is focused on assessing the effects of corrosion and fatigue induced cracks on the strength degradation in marine structures. Various existing general corrosion models for tanker structures have been studied and compared for time variant neutral axis, section modulus at deck and section modulus at keel based on various years of service. Simplified formulae to estimate time variant vertical/horizontal section modulus degradation and stress change at upper deck and keel are developed based on the <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tanker.</b> A fatigue assessment study which considers the new corrosion degradation model has also been carried out for the side shell stiffened plates of a North Sea operating shuttle tanker and of a world wide operating tanker. In addition, over 265 non-linear finite element analyses of panels with various locations and sizes of pitting corrosion have been carried out. The results indicate that the length, breadth and depth of pit corrosion have weakening effects on the ultimate strength of the plates while plate slenderness has only marginal effect on strength reduction. Transverse location of pit corrosion is also an important factor determining the amount of strength reduction. When corrosion spreads transversely on both edges, it has the most deteriorating effect on strength. In this study, The multi-variable regression method and the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) method are applied to derive new formulae to predict ultimate strength of both uncorroded and locally corroded plate. It is found out that the proposed formulae can accurately predict the ultimate strength of both uncorroded and locally corroded plate under uni-axial compression. It is certain that undetected defects and developing cracks may lead to catastrophic fracture failure. Fracture control is necessary to prevent the ship’s structure safety not to fall down below a certain safety limit. It is very important to calculate how the structural strength is affected by cracks and to calculate the time in which a crack growth to the unacceptable limits. Fatigue analysis can estimate the elapsed time and locations where cracks could develop, whereas fracture mechanic approach can estimate crack growth times and response of structural strength as a function of crack size. In this study, the linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) method based on stress intensity factor (K) and the elastic plastic fracture mechanics (EPFM) approach based on J-Integral and crack tip opening displacement (CTOD) have been investigated under different loads and crack sizes and material properties by using finite element analyses method. The finite element modelling and calculation for stress intensity factor (K) and J-computation are not easy tasks for most of engineers and researchers who do not have enough experiences. Accordingly some useful macro programs are developed for automatic creation of geometry, mesh details, boundary condition and applying loads, for automatic calculation of stress intensity factor (K) and computation of J-integral value. Proposed formulae based on multi-variable regression method and ANN might be useful to assess structural integrity during the initial design, on-site inspection and maintenance. In addition the developed macro programs for stress intensity factors (K) and J-computation could save time and efforts from time consuming finite element analyses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the most recent}} improvements and application of the Simplified Collision Model SIMCOL, developed under SNAME Ad Hoc Panel # 6 for the rapid prediction of collision damage in probabilistic analysis. IMO’s ongoing transition to probabilistic performance-based standards requires the ability to predict the probabilistic environmental performance and safety of specific ship designs. Current IMO regulations use probability density functions (pdfs) to describe the location, extent and penetration of side and bottom damage. These pdfs are derived from lim-ited historical damage statistics, and applied identically to all ships without consideration of their structural design. They do not consider the effect of structural design or crashworthiness on dam-age extent. SIMCOL provides a means to correct this deficiency.

The OPA 90 was the first legislation demanding <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> on oil <b>tankers</b> in order to prevent the spillage of oil in case of a grounding or collision. The IMO adopted amendments to MARPOL 73 / 78 in 1992, which for example required all new tankers of 600 dwt and above to have double sides or double bottom and tankers of 5, 000 dwt and above to have both double bottom and double sides. The Erika accident outside the French coast shook the EU and a stricter regulation, in comparison with the MARPOL, on <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tankers</b> was adopted. The Prestige accident in 2002 further spurred the EU to put pressure on the IMO to implement the same accelerated phase out scheme of single <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers</b> as the EU had already adopted. This developed into a battle between the EU and the IMO on the jurisdictional right to prevent marine pollution by phasing out single <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers.</b> The thesis is a descriptive and analytical study of the development of the MARPOL and EU phase out schemes. By presenting the relevant UNCLOS articles it is analyzed how unilateral legislation may prevent single <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers</b> by using the jurisdiction of flag, port, and coastal states. The EU has taken an independent initiative to regulate the phase out stricter than the IMO and chapter 2 examines the jurisdiction of the EU in the field of maritime pollution prevention. The study shows that the EU member states may, by using their flag and port state jurisdiction given to them by the UNCLOS, implement the EU regulation. Chapter 3 describes how the MARPOL and EU schemes on the phasing out of single <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers</b> developed. These schemes came about during a process lasting a decade when both organizations wanted to prove their efficiency to respond quickly to the problems of oil pollution. Finally, the EU, after political pressure from the EU member states and the public opinion, had the IMO adopting the same phase out scheme as the EU but with some exemptions. The shipping industry is vulnerable to unilateral legislation since shipping is an international business and EU politicians are not considered to be as competent in the maritime field as experts of the IMO. Therefore, the IMO needs to take the initiative back from the EU on all matters concerning marine legislation. The last chapter analyzes the possible consequences for the shipping industry due to the phasing out of single <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers.</b> The phase out require, among other things, new tonnage to be built and old tonnage to be scrapped. There are many consequences for the shipping industry when new legislation is made and some of them may be very costly for some of the actors in the shipping industry...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an investigation of}} the longitudinal strength of ships with damages due to grounding or collision accidents. Analytical equations are derived for the residual hull girder strength and verified with direct calculations of sample commercial ships for a broad spectrum of accidents. Hull girder ultimate strengths of these sample vessels under sagging and hogging conditions are also calculated, based on which correlation equations are proposed. To evaluate a grounded ship, using the section modulus to the deck would be optimistic, while using the section modulus to the bottom would be conservative. On the contrary, to evaluate a collided ship, using the section modulus to the deck would be conservative, while using the section modulus to the bottom would be optimistic. The derived analytical formulae are then applied to a fleet of 67 commercial ships, including 21 <b>double</b> <b>hull</b> <b>tankers,</b> 18 bulk carriers, 22 single <b>hull</b> <b>tankers</b> and six container carriers. The mean values, standard deviations and coefficients of variation for the coefficients in these new analytical formulae are obtained. The ship length exhibits little influence on these coefficients because they are close to the mean values although ship length spans from 150 to 400 m. The ship type shows some influence on the residual strength. Uniform equations are proposed for commercial ships which do not depend on a ship’s principal dimensions. These formulae provide very handy tools for predicting the residual strength in seconds, without performing step-by-step detailed calculations, an obvious advantage in cases of emergency or salvage operation. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|Analyses {{of thirty}} years of US and {{international}} marine oil spill data have revealed that spillage rates have generally decreased despite overall increases in oil production and transportation (Etkin, 2001). At the same time, occasional large spills ─ along with increasing expectations of effective spill response ─ have necessitated complex contingency planning for increasingly rare high-impact events. Past oil spill trends for vessels from 1985 - 2000 and potential future spill rates in light of improvements implementation of <b>double</b> <b>hulls</b> on <b>tankers</b> and bunker tanks are analyzed with regard to future contingency planning needs in the US. A methodology for determining theoretical and most-likely worst-case oil spill scenarios for contingency planning for ports will be described. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Double</b> <b>hull</b> (DH) <b>tankers</b> {{may be more}} {{effective}} than single <b>hull</b> (SH) <b>tankers</b> in pollution prevention because they have a second barrier, the inner skin, to oil outflow in the event of side damage. The actual effect of DHs calls for quantitative study. This paper presents a comparative study on the side structure resistance to collisions. A DH Aframax tanker and an SH Aframax tanker of similar size were selected for the study. The two vessels were assumed to be struck by a same bulbous bow in different locations and angles. The bow was assumed to be rigid and different non-linear materials and contact models were considered for the struck tankers based on the original designs. The DH tanker was found to be superior to the SH tanker in relation to resistance to side structural damage. Finally, by using the simulation results, the distribution of damage extents for DH tankers is proposed based on the historical damage extents, which are mainly for SH tankers...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze the {{economic}} viability of a {{liquefied natural gas}} (LNG) terminal in Newfoundland, with export to European markets. Natural gas is extracted offshore Newfoundland & Labrador and transported via pipeline to shore. The natural gas liquids (NGLs) and impurities are then separated from the pure methane. The NGLs are processed at an NGL processing plant and sold on their respective markets. The impurities are discarded and the natural gas is then liquefied and loaded onto <b>double</b> <b>hulled</b> <b>tankers,</b> which will transport the LNG to European markets. Capital and operating expenditures are calculated, with a 20 year production profile. Royalties are analyzed and compared using the Nova Scotia and Newfoundland royalty systems. Provincial and Federal corporate income taxes are {{also included in the}} analysis. The pipeline and LNG transport will be contracted out to outside parties. The producer will operate the production facility, as well as the LNG and NGL stations. Three reserve scenarios are analyzed (4 - 6 trillion cubic feet) and an internal rate of return (IRR) on the project is determined for the producer until different price scenarios, which range from $ 6 CDN/MMBtu to $ 16 CDN/MMBtu. The project is considered to be economically viable if the IRR is at least 15 %, according to industry standards set by Husky Energy, operating from St. John’s, Newfoundland. Given that the price of natural gas in Europe is expected to increase to nearly $ 14 CDN/MMBtu in 2016, the project is deemed to be economically viable under all reserve scenarios...|$|R
