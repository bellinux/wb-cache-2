5000|$|ISO/IEC 7812 Identification cards â€” Identification of issuers {{was first}} {{published}} by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1989. It is the international standard that specifies [...] "a numbering system for {{the identification of the}} card issuers, the format of the <b>issuer</b> <b>identification</b> number (IIN) and the primary account number (PAN).", and procedures for registering IINs.

5000|$|The {{official}} [...] "ISO Register of <b>Issuer</b> <b>Identification</b> Numbers", is {{not available}} to the general public. It is only available to institutions who hold IINs published in the Register, financial networks and processors. Institutions are required to sign a licensing agreement before they are given access to the Register. Several IINs are well known, especially those representing credit card issuers.|$|E

These {{identify}} the card issuing institution that issued the card to the card holder. The rest of the number is allocated by the card issuer. The card numbers length is its number of digits. Many card issuers print the entire IIN and account number on their card.|$|E
40|$|The Material Control and Accountability (MC and A) Group has {{developed}} an electronic scan system to acknowledge issuance and returns of Tamper Indicating Device (TID) seals. Important MC and A features of the system are: 1. The system requires the <b>issuer</b> <b>identification</b> and the identification of applicators to be entered, thereby ensuring {{that at least two}} qualified issuers and applicators possess the seals. Also, Operations is prompted to ensure the Two Person Rule is met during issuance and application of the seals. 2. All input is date and time stamped to ease resolution of anomalies. 3. The system requires all information to be input before allowing the user to logoff, thereby eliminating the problem of incomplete information in the records. 4. The input is immediately available to FBL MC and A personnel outside the facility who then know to expect completed procedures and forms regarding these transactions. The paper will describe the application of these features in routine operations as well as the development effort and final configuration of the system...|$|E
