The COINTELPRO Papers (1990; reissued 2002), also co-authored with Jim Vander Wall, {{examines}} a series of original FBI memos that detail the Bureau's activities against various leftist groups, from the U.S. Communist Party in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s.|$|E

25|$|Hughes {{was married}} to American poet Sylvia Plath from 1956 until her suicide in 1963 {{at the age of}} 30. Some feminists and some American admirers of Plath blamed him for her death. His last poetic work, Birthday Letters (1998), {{explored}} their complex relationship. These poems make reference to Plath's suicide, but none addresses directly the circumstances of her death. A poem discovered in October 2010, Last letter, <b>describes</b> <b>what</b> happened during the three days before her death.|$|E

25|$|Approximately In 1816, Jeong Hak-yu, {{the second}} son of Jeong Yak-yong, a {{prominent}} politician and scholar of Joseon dynasty at the time, wrote a poem called Nongga Wollyeongga (농가월령가). This poem, {{which is an}} important source of Korean folk history, <b>describes</b> <b>what</b> ordinary Korean farming families did in each month of a year. In the description of the month of August the poem tells of a married woman visiting her birth parents with boiled dog meat, rice cake, and rice wine, thus showing the popularity of dog meat at the time (Ahn, 2000; Seo, 2002). Dongguk Sesigi (동국세시기), a book written by a Korean scholar Hong Seok-mo in 1849, contains a recipe of Bosintang including a boiled dog, green onion, and red chili pepper powder.|$|E
25|$|In any case, no {{evidence}} has ever proven {{the existence of}} Fräulein Sprengel or her Lodge. (By Westcott's account, {{the other members of}} the German order supposedly objected to Sprengel's chartering of the Isis-Urania Lodge, and all further communications were cut off after she died.) The Isis-Urania Charter was written and signed only by Westcott, Mathers and William Robert Woodman. There are letters by Mackenzie that indicate the 'Society of Eight' existed, but nothing that <b>describes</b> <b>what</b> they actually taught or practiced. The symbolism and philosophy contained in the Cipher Manuscripts are not very different from that of high-degree Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, and Mackenzie and the members of the S.R.I.A. were capable-enough esoteric scholars, with access to works on the Qabalah, Hermeticism, and Egyptology in Masonic libraries, to have combined it all into the form followed by the Golden Dawn.|$|E

Isidore <b>describes</b> <b>what</b> rhetoric is, kinds of argument, maxims, elocution, ways of speaking, and figures of speech. On dialectic, he discusses philosophy, syllogisms, and definitions. He equates the Greek term syllogism with the Latin term argumentation (argumentatio), which he {{derives from the}} Latin for [...] "clear mind" [...] (arguta mens).|$|E

' [...] "Go on," [...] Mundin ordered impatiently. Fifi had caught on and lowered her pants and panties to her ankles.

500|$|Children of Men {{explores the}} themes of hope and faith {{in the face of}} {{overwhelming}} futility and despair. [...] The film's source, P. D. James' novel The Children of Men (1992), <b>describes</b> <b>what</b> happens when society is unable to reproduce, using male infertility to explain this problem. [...] In the novel, it is made clear that hope depends on future generations. James writes, [...] "It was reasonable to struggle, to suffer, perhaps even to die, for a more just, a more compassionate society, but not in a world with no future where, all too soon, the very words 'justice,' 'compassion,' 'society,’ 'struggle,' 'evil,' would be unheard echoes on an empty air." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, [...] "Burning Up" [...] has a starker {{arrangement}} {{brought about}} by bass, single guitar and drum machine. The guitar riffs in the songs were not characteristics of Madonna's later records. The tom-tom drum beats used in the song were reminiscent of the records of singer Phil Collins. It also incorporated electric guitars and the most state-of-the-art synthesizers of that time. The chorus is a repetition of the same three lines of the lyrics, while the bridge consists {{of a series of}} double entendres in regards to the lyrics of the song which <b>describes</b> <b>what</b> she is prepared to do for her lover and that she is individualistic and shameless.|$|E

According to Matt Gelb of The Philadelphia Inquirer, [...] "Bold best <b>describes</b> <b>what</b> Rubén Amaro Jr. has done so far in putting together the 2014 Phillies and it sure is appropriate that the word ends with the letters O-L-D." [...] The team wanted to re-sign Carlos Ruiz (or find another catcher) and sign a right-handed-hitting corner outfielder and a middle-of-the-rotation starter to supplement Cole Hamels and Cliff Lee after the departure of Roy Halladay and the discovery of medical problems in Cuban Miguel Alfredo González, signed by the Phillies the previous summer.|$|E

Thanhouser films, as moral as they were, did not depict the actual violence which would be formally alluded to in the synopsis.

500|$|Metal {{historian}} Ian Christe <b>describes</b> <b>what</b> {{the components}} of the term mean in [...] "hippiespeak": [...] "heavy" [...] is roughly synonymous with [...] "potent" [...] or [...] "profound," [...] and [...] "metal" [...] designates a certain type of mood, grinding and weighted as with metal. The word [...] "heavy" [...] in this sense was a basic element of beatnik and later countercultural hippie slang, and references to [...] "heavy music"—typically slower, more amplified variations of standard pop fare—were already common by the mid-1960s. Iron Butterfly's debut album, released in early 1968, was titled Heavy. The first use of [...] "heavy metal" [...] in a song lyric is in reference to a motorcycle in the Steppenwolf song [...] "Born to Be Wild", also released that year: [...] "I like smoke and lightning/Heavy metal thunder/Racin' with the wind/And the feelin' that I'm under." ...|$|E
