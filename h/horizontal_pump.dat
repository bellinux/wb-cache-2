40|$|Thesis (MTech(Civil Engineering)) [...] Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2006. The {{performance}} of a centrifugal pump is altered for slurry or viscous materials (Stepanoff, 1969) and {{this needs to be}} accounted for. Usually, the suitable selection and evaluation of centrifugal pumps is based only on water pump performance curves supplied by the pump manufacturer (Wilson, Addie, Sellgren & Clift, 1997). In 1984 Walker and Goulas conducted a number of pump performance tests with kaolin clay slurries and coal slurries on a Warman 4 / 3 AH horizontal slurry pump and a Hazleton 3 -inch B CTL <b>horizontal</b> <b>pump</b> (Walker and Goulas, 1984). Walker and Goulas have analysed the test data and correlated the performance derating both at the best efficiency flow rate (BEP) and at 10 % of the best efficiency flow rate (0. 1 BEP) to the modified pump Reynolds number (NRep). They have noticed that the head and the efficiency reduction ratio decreased for the pump Reynolds number less then 10 ⁶. Furthermore, Walker and Goulas obtained a reasonably good agreement (± 5 %) between pump test data for non-Newtonian materials and pump performance prediction using the Hydraulics Institute chart. Sery and Slatter (2002) have investigated pump deration for non-Newtonian yield pseudoplastic materials. The NRep was calculated using the Bingham plastic viscosity (µp). Results have shown good agreement with regard to head and efficiency reduction ratios in comparison with previous work. However, Sery and Slatter's pump performance correlation using the HI chart did not reach the same conclusion. Error margin of ± 20 % and ± 10 % were found for head and efficiency respectively. This study is an attempt to reconcile the differences between Walker and Goulas (1984) and Sery and Slatter (2002) and extend the evaluation of these derating methods to pseudoplastic materials. The test work was conducted in the Flow Process Research Centre laboratory of the Cape Peninsula University of Technology using two centrifugal pumps; a Warman 6 / 4 and a GrW 4 / 3. The materials used were water, CMC solution bentonite and kaolin suspension at different concentrations (7 % and 9 % by weight for bentonite; 5 %, 6 % and 7 % by weight for CMC; 17 %, 19 % and 21 % by volume for kaolin) ...|$|E

25|$|The unevaporated {{seawater}} in an evaporator gradually {{becomes a}} concentrated brine and, like the early steam boilers with seawater feed, this brine must be intermittently blown down every {{six to eight}} hours and dumped overboard. Early evaporators were simply mounted high-up and dumped their brine by gravity. As the increasing complexity of surface condensers demanded better feedwater quality, a pump {{became part of the}} evaporator equipment. This pump had three combined functions as a seawater feed pump, a fresh water delivery pump and a brine extraction pump, each of progressively smaller capacity. The brine salinity was an important factor in evaporator efficiency: too dense encouraged scale formation, but too little represented a waste of heated seawater. The optimum operating salinity was thus fixed at three times that of seawater, and so the brine pump had to remove at least one third of the total feedwater supply rate. These pumps resembled the steam-powered reciprocating feedwater pumps already in service. They were usually produced by the well-known makers, such as G & J Weir. Vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>pumps</b> were used, although <b>horizontal</b> <b>pumps</b> were favoured as they encouraged the de-aeration of feedwater. Electrically powered rotary centrifugal pumps were later adopted, as more efficient and more reliable. There were initial concerns whether these would be capable of pumping brine against the vacuum of the evaporator and so there was also a transitional type where a worm gear-driven plunger pump for brine was driven from the rotary shaft.|$|R

When full, the water in the canal is 2.7 m deep and flows purely by gravity apart from where two deep wadis intersect the course of the canal (Nahal Amud and Nahal Tzalmon).

Aiming at the {{deficiencies}} of tubing-conveyed oriented perforating technology for <b>horizontal</b> well, a <b>pumping</b> perforation technology in horizontal well has been developed. Pumping perforation technology {{process is a}} perforation process transferring the perforating gun string into perforation section of the <b>horizontal</b> well with <b>pumping</b> fluid, and then completing the perforation while perforating bullets exploding after powering on, and finally towing back the perforating gun {{to the ground with}} cable.

30|$|Nevertheless, {{the absence}} of {{consolidated}} approaches in this field implied that a similar technology still today can be reputed only a scientific exercise, although there are numerous studies conducted also on experimental sites [9, 10, 11]. Pumps manufactures, indeed, usually do not provide information about efficiency of a pump used like a turbine. Various researchers indicated the single-stage centrifugal pumps as the optimal and most convenient choice for a PAT, operating, however, in a range from low-to-medium head [12, 13, 14, 15]. However, most of tests and experiments were conducted on <b>horizontal</b> single-stage <b>pumps,</b> although different types of pumps are available like multi-stage, vertical pumps, etc. Despite the numerous models and equations able to define the efficiency of a pump used in a reverse mode, this issue is still open and the efficiency of a pump when operating as turbine remains the main criticism that limits their application [16]. Moreover, experimental investigations are carried out to improve the PAT performances modifying impeller diameter and rotational speed. A simple reshaping of the blades of the impeller (with a blade rounding) can increase the PAT performances; in the same way, the greater size of the impeller increases its performances, due to {{the absence of}} a lateral passageway for the turbinated water (differently that in pump mode) and to a refinement of the inlet and outlet parts [17].|$|R
