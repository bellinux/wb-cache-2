50|$|A global <b>depository</b> <b>receipt</b> (GDR) is a {{certificate}} issued by a depository bank, which purchases shares of foreign companies and deposits {{it on the}} account.

5000|$|A {{depositary}} receipt is a security that is {{offered as a}} [...] "tracking stock" [...] on another foreign market. For instance a Chinese company wishing to raise more money may issue a <b>depository</b> <b>receipt</b> on the New York Stock Exchange, {{as the amount of}} capital on the local exchanges is limited. These securities, known as ADRs (American {{depositary receipt}}) or GDRs (global <b>depository</b> <b>receipt)</b> depending on where they are issued, are typically considered [...] "foreign" [...] and therefore trade at a lower value when first released. Many ADR's are exchangeable into the original security (known as fungibility) and actually have the same value. In this case there is a spread between the perceived value and real value, which can be extracted. Other ADR's that are not exchangeable often have much larger spreads. Since the ADR is trading at a value lower than what it is worth, one can purchase the ADR and expect to make money as its value converges on the original. However, there is a chance that the original stock will fall in value too, so by shorting it one can hedge that risk.|$|E
