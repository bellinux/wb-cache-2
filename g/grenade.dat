5|$|As {{the team}} {{advanced}} to the front, they were brought under heavy enemy rifle, <b>grenade</b> and mortar fire. Just as the three had reached the front lines, a Japanese <b>grenade</b> landed among them. It {{was less than a}} foot from the two Marines with PFC Gonsalves. Without a moment's hesitation, he flung himself on the <b>grenade,</b> taking the full explosion into his own body. He gallantly gave his life for his fellow Marines and his country. The other two were not even touched by <b>grenade</b> fragments and they successfully completed their mission.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Grenade,</b> Hand, Anti-Tank No. 74, {{commonly}} known as the S.T. <b>Grenade</b> or sticky bomb, was a British hand <b>grenade</b> designed and produced during the Second World War. The <b>grenade</b> was {{one of a number of}} anti-tank weapons developed for use by the British Army and Home Guard as an ad hoc solution to a lack of sufficient anti-tank guns in the aftermath of the Dunkirk evacuation. Designed by a team from MIR(c) including Major Millis Jefferis and Stuart Macrae, the <b>grenade</b> consisted of a glass sphere containing an explosive made of nitroglycerin and additives (this added stability to the mix, as well as giving it its squash-head-like effect) covered in a strong adhesive and surrounded by a sheet-metal casing. When the user pulled a pin on the handle of the <b>grenade,</b> the casing would fall away and expose the sticky sphere. Pulling another pin would arm the firing mechanism and the user would then attempt to attach the <b>grenade</b> to an enemy tank or other vehicle. Letting go of the handle would release a lever that would activate a five-second fuse, which would then detonate the nitroglycerin.|$|E
5000|$|Hand <b>grenades</b> come {{in several}} less-lethal varieties, such as [...] "flashbang" [...] (stun) <b>grenades,</b> [...] "sting" [...] <b>grenades</b> with rubber shrapnel, and <b>grenades</b> {{designed}} to release chemical irritants (described below).|$|R
25|$|The Armed Forces of the Philippines will acquire {{close to}} P40m ($1m) worth of hand <b>grenades</b> {{to be used}} for {{security}} operations. A bid bulletin published in The STAR showed that the AFP will acquire 11,364 smoke <b>grenades</b> and 11,460 fragmentation <b>grenades.</b> The government has allotted P19.944m for the smoke <b>grenades</b> and P19.998m for the fragmentation <b>grenades.</b>|$|R
50|$|These {{are also}} called gas <b>grenades,</b> {{and are used}} at longer ranges. They are {{analogous}} to rifle <b>grenades,</b> providing increased accuracy and range over hand-thrown gas <b>grenades.</b> Gas <b>grenades</b> may be used by operators without gas masks, as the agent is only dispersed {{in the area of}} impact, as far away as 150 yd. The agent in gas <b>grenades</b> is dispersed as a gas or an aerosol spray.|$|R
5|$|By July 1940 the {{situation}} had improved somewhat with uniforms, a modicum of training {{and the arrival of}} hundreds of thousands of rifles and millions of rounds of ammunition from the USA. New weapons were developed that could be produced cheaply without consuming materials that were needed to produce armaments for the regular units. An early example was the No. 76 Special Incendiary <b>Grenade</b> (a glass bottle filled with highly flammable material of which more than six million were made), and the No. 73 <b>Grenade</b> (an anti-tank <b>grenade</b> resembling a Thermos flask).|$|E

5|$|In the Wujing Zongyao {{and other}} {{military}} texts, the distinction between a bomb and a <b>grenade</b> is ambiguous.

50|$|The Japanese Army, {{noting that}} <b>grenades</b> were short-ranged weapons, began efforts to {{optimize}} these weapons for close-in infantry fighting. After studying employment of <b>grenades</b> and mortars on the battlefield, the Japanese Army developed hand <b>grenades,</b> rifle <b>grenades,</b> and grenade/mortar shell dischargers (small mortars) suited to warfare in typical short-range combat environments such as urban, trench, and jungle warfare.|$|R

5|$|The <b>grenade</b> {{had several}} faults with its design. In tests, {{it failed to}} adhere to dusty or muddy tanks and, if the user was not careful after freeing the <b>grenade</b> from its casing, it could easily stick to his uniform. The Ordnance Board of the War Department did not approve the <b>grenade</b> {{for use by the}} British Army, but {{personal}} intervention by the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, led to the <b>grenade</b> going into production. Between 1940 and 1943, approximately 2.5 million were produced. It was primarily issued to the Home Guard, but was also used by British and Commonwealth forces in North Africa, accounting for six German tanks; used by Allied Forces on the Anzio Beachhead, including the First Special Service Force; as well as by Australian Army units during the New Guinea campaign. The French Resistance were also issued a quantity of the grenades.|$|E
5|$|<b>Grenade</b> {{was then}} {{transferred}} to the English Channel and collided with the anti-submarine trawler Clayton Wyke on 14 May in heavy fog. Her repairs were completed at Sheerness Dockyard on 25 May. During {{the initial stages of}} the evacuation from Dunkirk the ship provided cover {{in the northern part of}} the Channel to the evacuation forces and took part in the rescue of 33 survivors on 28 May from the coaster , which had been torpedoed by an E-boat. She made one trip to Dunkirk during the night of 28/29 May and was caught in Dunkirk harbour by German Stukas during the following day. <b>Grenade</b> was hit by two bombs which set her afire and killed 14 sailors and mortally wounded another four men. The ship was cast off from her berth, in case she sank there, and then drifted into the harbour channel. The trawler John Cattling towed <b>Grenade</b> over to the west side of the outer harbour where her magazines exploded later that evening.|$|E
5|$|HMS <b>Grenade</b> (H86) was a G-class {{destroyer}} {{built for}} the Royal Navy during the 1930s.

5000|$|To counter defense {{claims that}} the inert <b>grenades</b> were legal curios or {{ornaments}} and not live weapons, the judge cited a prior case as establishing that possession of a glass bottle, flammable liquid and cloth {{in the same place}} at the same time was constructive possession of a molotov cocktail and prosecution did not require an assembled molotov cocktail; therefore, Ballew's possession of both inert <b>grenades</b> and of gunpowder and primers for his guns also constituted possession of live hand <b>grenades,</b> even without assembly of live <b>grenades.</b> Also by modifying three of the <b>grenades</b> to pop caps as noise makers, Ballew had weaponized the <b>grenades</b> and they were no longer inert curios or ornaments.

5|$|Hand <b>grenade,</b> {{explosive}}: Before explosive grenades, incendiary grenades {{were used}} by the Eastern Roman Empire, incorporating Greek fire. Early prototypes to the modern explosive <b>grenade,</b> according to British scientist and sinologist Joseph Needham, appear in the military book, Wujing Zongyao ("Compilation of Military Classics"), by 1044. During the Song Dynasty, weapons known as Zhen Tian Lei were created when Chinese soldiers packed gunpowder into ceramic or metal containers and thrown at the enemy. Further descriptions and illustrations of early Chinese hand grenades are provided in the Huolongjing.|$|E
5|$|Lopez {{engaged the}} enemy {{immediately}} after landing with the assault waves. He exposed himself to enemy fire {{in an attempt}} to throw a hand <b>grenade</b> into a pillbox whose fire was pinning down that sector of the beach. He was wounded by enemy gun fire and dropped the <b>grenade.</b> Unable to grasp the hand <b>grenade</b> firmly enough to hurl it, he chose to sacrifice himself rather than endanger the lives of his men. He cradled the <b>grenade</b> under him and absorbed the full impact of the explosion, thus saving the lives of his comrades. Lopez was nominated for the Medal of Honor. Lopez however, was not the only Hispanic member of the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division to be awarded the Medal of Honor. PFC Eugene Arnold Obregon (1930–1950), who also participated in the Inchon landing, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions 11 days after Lopez gave his life.

5|$|Staff Sergeant Leroy A. Petry {{distinguished}} {{himself by}} acts of gallantry and intrepidity {{at the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} in action with an armed enemy in the vicinity of Paktya Province, Afghanistan, on May 26, 2008. As a Weapons Squad Leader with D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, Staff Sergeant Petry moved to clear the courtyard of a house that potentially contained high-value combatants. While crossing the courtyard, Staff Sergeant Petry and another Ranger were engaged and wounded by automatic weapons fire from enemy fighters. Still under enemy fire, and wounded in both legs, Staff Sergeant Petry led the other Ranger to cover. He then reported the situation and engaged the enemy with a hand <b>grenade,</b> providing suppression as another Ranger moved to his position. The enemy quickly responded by maneuvering closer and throwing grenades. The first <b>grenade</b> explosion knocked his two fellow Rangers to the ground and wounded both with shrapnel. A second <b>grenade</b> then landed only a few feet away from them. Instantly realizing the danger, Staff Sergeant Petry, unhesitatingly and with complete disregard for his safety, deliberately and selflessly moved forward, picked up the <b>grenade,</b> and in an effort to clear the immediate threat, threw the <b>grenade</b> away from his fellow Rangers. As he was releasing the <b>grenade</b> it detonated, amputating his right hand at the wrist and further injuring him with multiple shrapnel wounds. Although picking up and throwing the live <b>grenade</b> grievously wounded Staff Sergeant Petry, his gallant act undeniably saved his fellow Rangers from being severely wounded or killed. Despite the severity of his wounds, Staff Sergeant Petry continued to maintain the presence of mind to place a tourniquet on his right wrist before communicating the situation by radio in order to coordinate support for himself and his fellow wounded Rangers. Staff Sergeant Petry's extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service, and reflect great credit upon himself, 75th Ranger Regiment, and the United States Army.|$|E
5|$|The <b>grenade</b> did possess several {{problems}} with its design. Users were urged to actually {{run up to}} the tank and place it by hand, rather than throw it, thus the adhesive could very easily stick to their uniform in the process; the user would then {{be placed in the}} unenviable situation of attempting to pry the <b>grenade</b> loose whilst still holding onto the lever. It was also discovered that as time passed the nitroglycerin began to deteriorate and become unstable, which made it even more difficult to use. As the <b>grenade</b> was a short-range weapon, users were trained to hide in a trench or other place of concealment until the tank went past them, and then to stick the <b>grenade</b> {{to the rear of the}} tank, where its armour was thinnest. Users were relatively safe from a few yards away, as long as they were not in line with the handle when it detonated. The Mark II design used a plastic casing instead of glass, and a detonator instead of a cap.|$|E
5|$|The insurgents {{responded by}} {{throwing}} a <b>grenade</b> at the Marines. The two Marines with Sgt. Peralta {{tried to get}} out of the room but could not. Sgt. Peralta was still conscious on the floor and despite his wounds was able to reach for the <b>grenade</b> and pull it under his body absorbing the majority of the lethal blast and shrapnel which killed him instantly, but saved the lives of his fellow marines.|$|E
50|$|When {{the formula}} is {{considered}} ideal, {{the next step}} will be to develop a delivery system using airships. A four-passenger airship is built, with sufficient storage to carry an unspecified amount of the fire-fighting <b>grenades.</b> To aid in dropping <b>grenades,</b> Tom builds a bombsight, which, when mechanically adjusted for altitude, air speed, wind, {{and the weight of}} the <b>grenades,</b> will permit accurate placement of the <b>grenades</b> over the target.|$|R
50|$|HE <b>grenades</b> {{have been}} {{considered}} the standard for both types of 40 mm <b>grenades,</b> {{but over the years}} the functions of the weapons using these <b>grenades</b> has dramatically expanded, and as a result the {{need to be able to}} engage larger and more armored targets.|$|R
50|$|In the American Civil War, {{both sides}} used hand <b>grenades</b> {{equipped}} with a plunger that detonated the device on impact. The Union relied on experimental Ketchum <b>Grenades,</b> which had a tail {{to ensure that the}} nose would strike the target and start the fuse. The Confederacy used spherical hand <b>grenades</b> that weighed about six pounds, sometimes with a paper fuse. They also used 'Rains' and 'Adams' <b>grenades,</b> which were similar to the Ketchum in appearance and mechanism. Improvised hand <b>grenades</b> were also used to great effect by the Russian defenders of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War.|$|R

5|$|Born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Petry had {{an active}} youth, {{and joined the}} Army after high school. Completing the Ranger Indoctrination Program, he was {{deployed}} several times to both Iraq and Afghanistan {{as a member of}} the 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment. On May 26, 2008 during his seventh deployment, Petry was a member of a team on a mission to capture a Taliban target in Paktia Province. Despite being wounded in both legs by gunfire, Petry continued to fight and give orders. When a <b>grenade</b> landed between him and two other soldiers, Petry grabbed it and attempted to throw it away from them. He saved the soldiers' lives but the <b>grenade</b> exploded, severing his right hand.|$|E
