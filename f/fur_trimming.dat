According to Ingersoll, Yount was quite careful about his {{personal}} appearance: [...] "his belt, holster, knife-sheath, bridle, and saddle are all set off with a barbaric glitter." [...] Yount paid a Shoshone woman to decorate his buckskin jacket, [...] "a marvel of fringes, <b>fur</b> <b>trimming</b> and intricate embroidery of beads." [...] Ingersoll wrote that Yount was [...] "by nature a gentleman, and under his sinewy frame and tireless strength, there is a heart as tender as a girl's, which hates the cruelty his profession unavoidably occasions. [...] His eye is open to every beautiful feature of the grand world in which he lives; his heart is alive to all the gentle influences of the original wilderness." [...] Ingersoll's 1883 book, Knocking 'Round the Rockies, describes Yount in a similar fashion.|$|E

The winter sunlight shone full upon her, and either that or the cold breeze that she had met on the headland accounted for the color in her cheeks. She made a dainty picture in her fur cap and close-fitting jacket, whose rich <b>fur</b> <b>trimming</b> set off the curves of a shapely figure. The man's longing must have shown itself in his eyes, for Helen suddenly turned her glance away from him. Again she felt a curious thrill, almost of pleasure, and wondered at it. If she had guessed his meaning correctly she would have felt merely sorry for him, and yet {{there was no mistaking}} an indefinite sense of satisfaction.|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the 18th century, middle-class women had adopted various impromptu ways of kilting their overskirts up out of the muck of the streets. The polonaise was a fashionable variant of this style. The name Polonaise (or polonese) derives [...] "obviously from Polish styles—whether it referred originally to the <b>fur</b> <b>trimming</b> or to the kilting up to one side (a Polish fashion which came from Turkish costume) is not really clear." [...] There is some controversy over application of the name polonaise to 18th century dress. Some sources define it as being cut in the same fashion as a robe à l'anglaise, but with cords pulling up the skirts in two places in the back, and they date the style from {{the beginning}} of the 1770s.
