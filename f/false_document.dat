25|$|Some of Crichton's fiction used a {{literary}} technique called <b>false</b> <b>document.</b> For example, Eaters of the Dead is a fabricated recreation of the Old English epic Beowulf {{in the form}} of a scholarly translation of Ahmad ibn Fadlan's 10th-century manuscript. Other novels, such as The Andromeda Strain and Jurassic Park, incorporated fictionalized scientific documents {{in the form of}} diagrams, computer output, DNA sequences, footnotes and bibliography. Some of his novels, such as The Terminal Man and State of Fear, included authentic published scientific works to illustrate his point.|$|E
25|$|Then, in 1996, Crichton {{published}} Airframe, an aero-techno-thriller which {{relates the}} story of a quality assurance vice-president at the fictional aerospace manufacturer Norton Aircraft, as she investigates an in-flight accident aboard a Norton-manufactured airliner that leaves three passengers dead and fifty-six injured. Again, Crichton uses the <b>false</b> <b>document</b> literary device, presenting numerous technical documents {{to create a sense of}} authenticity. In the novel, Crichton draws from real life accidents to increase its sensation of realism, including American Airlines Flight 191 and Aeroflot Flight 593; the latter flew from Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport and crashed on its way to Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport in 1994. Crichton challenges the public perception of air safety and the consequences of exaggerated media reports to sell the story. The book also continues Crichton's overall theme of the failure of humans in human-machine interaction, given that the plane itself worked perfectly and the accident would not have occurred had the pilot reacted properly.|$|E

One of the [...] "cases", supposedly establishing a novel crime of [...] "doing what you like", was sharply criticised by an American law review article, whose author failed to note its entire absurdity. As such they are examples of the literary technique known as <b>false</b> <b>document.</b> And while in these fictitious law reports, the fictitious judges and lawyers regularly cited various real and venerable authorities, such as Henry de Bracton, they were prone also to citing texts of Herbert's own imagination such as [...] "Wedderburn on Water Courses" [...] and [...] "A.

2500|$|Machen, who {{had already}} written a number of factual {{articles}} on the conflict for the paper, set his story {{at the time of}} the retreat from the Battle of Mons in August 1914. The story described phantom bowmen from the Battle of Agincourt summoned by a soldier calling on St. George, destroying a German host. Machen's story was not, however, labelled as fiction and the same edition of the Evening News ran a story by a different author under the heading [...] "Our Short Story". Additionally, Machen's story was written from a first-hand perspective and was a kind of <b>false</b> <b>document,</b> a technique Machen knew well. The unintended result was that Machen had a number of requests to provide evidence for his sources for the story soon after its publication, from readers who thought it was true, to which he responded that it was completely imaginary, as he had no desire to create a hoax.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2015, Heard and Depp {{breached}} Australia's strict biosecurity laws {{when they}} failed to declare their two Yorkshire Terriers to the Australian Customs Service when they flew by private jet into Queensland, where {{he was working on}} the fifth Pirates installment. Australian quarantine regulations, which are aimed at keeping rabies out of the country, require dogs from outside the country be quarantined a minimum of ten days. Heard was charged with two counts of illegally importing the dogs into the country and one count of producing a <b>false</b> <b>document.</b> Shortly afterward, Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce said, [...] "If we start letting movie stars even though they've been the 'sexiest man alive' twice to come into our nation, then why don't we just break the laws for everybody? It's time that Pistol and Boo [...] buggered off back to the United States."

6000|$|I saw at {{a glance}} it gave them every advantage. In the first place, it put Harold {{virtually}} {{in the place of}} the accused, and compelled him to defend instead of attacking--an attitude which prejudices people against one from the outset. Then, again, it implied positive criminality on his part, and so allowed Lord Southminster to assume the air of injured innocence. The eldest son of the eldest brother, unjustly set aside by the scheming machinations of an unscrupulous cousin! Primogeniture, the ingrained English love for keeping up the dignity of a noble family, the prejudice in favour of the direct male line as against the female--all were astutely utilised in Lord Southminster's interest. But worst of all, it was I who had typewritten the will--I, a friend of Harold's, a woman whom Lord Southminster would doubtless try to exhibit as his fiancée. I saw at once how much like conspiracy it looked: Harold and I had agreed together to concoct a <b>false</b> <b>document,</b> and Harold had forged his uncle's signature to it. Could a British jury doubt when a Lord declared it? ...|$|E
