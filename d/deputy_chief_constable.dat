The police officer is strongly suspected to have been the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable</b> of Eastbourne, Alexander Seekings, and the magistrate to have been Gwynne. Despite the illegality of homosexual sex in 1956/57, the matter was not investigated further by police.|$|E
50|$|Until 2006, each force {{could only}} have one DCC, who would {{normally}} be second-in-command to the <b>chief</b> <b>constable.</b> However, Schedule 2 of the Police and Justice Act 2006 amended the Police Act 1996 to permit more than one DCC within each force.

25|$|Civilian {{airports}} in the United Kingdom were originally {{under the control}} of the Air Ministry, which was mainly concerned with the operation of the Royal Air Force, but was also responsible for non-military aviation. During this time, airfields and aerodromes were policed by the Air Ministry Constabulary, who were sworn in as special constables under section 3 of the Special Constables Act 1923. In 1946, F. J. May OBE was appointed as the first Chief Constable, and Squadron Leader D. F. Grierson MBE was appointed as <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Chairman of {{the magistrates}} was Sir Roland Gwynne, but {{he stepped down}} because of his close {{friendship}} with Adams. A vital piece of evidence, a cheque written out for £1000, went missing after the hearing, instigating a further police investigation. While the culprit was not found, Scotland Yard suspected the local <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable</b> of Eastbourne, Seekings, of having misplaced it to help Adams. Seekings was known to have taken holidays with Adams and Gwynne, and looked after Gwynne's finances {{while he was in}} hospital in January 1957.|$|E
50|$|Police {{authorities}} were empowered to choose <b>chief</b> <b>constables,</b> <b>deputy</b> and assistant <b>chief</b> <b>constables</b> from a Home Office shortlist. They could also require the <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable</b> to retire, {{subject to the}} Home Secretary's approval.|$|R
2500|$|Anger {{over the}} Anglo-Irish Agreement led to loyalist assaults {{on more than}} 500 homes {{belonging}} to Catholics and RUC officers during the mid-1980s. At least 150 RUC families were forced to move as a result. In 1998 <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable</b> Ronnie Flanagan stated {{in an interview on}} television that he was unhappy with any RUC officers belonging to the Orange Order {{or any of the other}} loyal orders. While the RUC refused to give any details on how many officers were members of the Order, thirty-nine RUC officers are listed on the Order's Roll of Honour (of 'Orangemen' killed in the conflict). The size of the RUC was increased on several occasions. At its height, there were 8,500 regular police officers supported by about 5,000 full-time and part-time reserve officers, making it the second largest force in the United Kingdom after the Metropolitan Police in London. The direction and control of the RUC was in the hands in the <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable,</b> who was assisted by two <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Constables</b> and nine Assistant <b>Chief</b> <b>Constables.</b> For operational purposes, Northern Ireland was divided into twelve Divisions and thirty-nine Sub-Divisions.

On 26 April 1898 he was promoted to Detective Sergeant and on 26 March 1900 to Inspector. Alfred Richardson remained in the Birmingham Central Detectives Office in the Municipal Buildings and the Moor Street Police Station and almost immediately he was promoted to Detective Inspector by the Birmingham Watch Committee of Police Promotion and Awards. Alfred Richardson was living with his new wife and her parents at this time. Alfred Richardson's mentor, Chief Superintendent Garrard Van Helden, died very suddenly in office in June 1901. Such was his standing in the Force that four <b>Chief</b> <b>Constables,</b> one of whom was Alfred's father Frank Richardson, and four <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Constables</b> attended his funeral of 15 June 1901, with Alfred acting as a pall-bearer. In May 1901 he successfully applied for the post of <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable</b> of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, beating 69 other applicants.

This is a by-product of political immediacy where directly elected politicians want to see eye-catching gimmicks for the electorate." [...] He concluded that [...] "the easy way to be a PCC is to not make any unpopular decisions about having the resources to hold the force to account, and act like a ceremonial mayor - cutting ribbons, taking the photo opportunities and launching a few initiatives. Everything else is left to the <b>chief</b> <b>constable</b> in the hope that he or she doesn't mess up or, more cynically, in the belief that {{you can get away with}} sacking them and passing on the blame before the next election." ...|$|R

2500|$|In December {{the police}} {{acquired}} a memorandum {{belonging to a}} Daily Mail journalist, concerning rumours of homosexuality between [...] "a police officer, a magistrate and a doctor". The last directly implied Adams. This information had come, according to the reporter, directly from Hannam. The 'magistrate' was Sir Roland Gwynne, Mayor of Eastbourne (1929–31) and brother of Rupert Gwynne, MP for Eastbourne (1910–24). Gwynne was Adams's patient and known to visit every day at 9am. They went on frequent holidays together and had spent three weeks in Scotland that September. The 'police officer' was the <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable</b> of Eastbourne, Alexander Seekings. Hannam ignored this line of inquiry (despite homosexual acts being a criminal offence in 1956), and the police instead gave the journalist a dressing-down. The memo is testament to Adams's close connections to those of power in Eastbourne at the time.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} John Stalker, <b>Deputy</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Constable</b> of Greater Manchester {{in the early}} 1980s and himself a Detective Inspector in 1973, has stated that the depiction of the police [...] "has {{got nothing to do}} with real policing in the 1970s. It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. In all the time I was in the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, but that was a case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and that we are seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E

Wiltshire Police allowed South Wales Police and the Independent Police Complaints Commission to conduct an inquiry into the matter. The coroner released [...] Wiltshire Police of any burden noting they had implented 'comprehensive welfare arrangements' for Mr Ainsworth. The independent report criticised Wiltshire Police for failing to properly vet Mr Ainsorth when assuming the role of DCC. The report also said the force was [...] "ill-prepared" [...] to deal with the [...] "exceptional situation" [...] of the harassment complaints made. Wiltshire Police responded saying that ACPO should share some of the burden as they had 'green lit' the application for the ACC to DCC promotion, a form that did not include a section for vetting.|$|E
