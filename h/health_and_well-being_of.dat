5|$|The novel Bulldog Drummond {{begins when}} Drummond places an {{advertisement}} {{in a newspaper}} looking for adventure to lift the ennui {{of his life in}} post-war London. The response comes from Phyllis Benton, who is concerned for the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> her father, over whom Henry Lakington and Carl Peterson have a hold. At {{the end of the novel}} Drummond and Phyllis marry, and remain married throughout the course of the McNeile and Fairlie series of books, in contrast to the films, which generally portray Drummond as unmarried. Phyllis becomes integral to the plot of some of the novels: she is kidnapped by Irma Peterson in several stories, including The Black Gang and The Female of the Species.|$|E

25|$|In 2010, a Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health study {{examining}} {{the effects of}} institutional discrimination on the psychiatric health of lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals found an increase in psychiatric disorders, including a more than doubling of anxiety disorders, among the LGB population living in states that instituted bans on same-sex marriage. According to the author, the study highlighted the importance of abolishing institutional forms of discrimination, including those leading to disparities in the mental <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> LGB individuals. Institutional discrimination is characterized by societal-level conditions that limit the opportunities and access to resources by socially disadvantaged groups.|$|E
25|$|The {{older women}} in the {{compound}} or community look after {{women in the}}ir postpartum period and assist with cleaning the baby and massage. Mothers receive postpartum teaching from the older women in the community. In the early postpartum period, there is great emphasis placed on the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> the mother and infant. Breastfeeding and postpartum abstinence is mandatory. Both mother and baby receive massages using shea-butter, palm kernel oil, and other oils. During this time, different colored and sized beads are tied around the wrist, waist, and ankles to monitor {{the growth of the}} infant. Older women will also keep a brass bowl full of herbs, mixtures, white clay, soft sponge, and charcoal. These items are believed to prevent health problems for the infant and mother.|$|E
25|$|In 1895, Clark University in Worcester, Massachusetts (United States) {{established}} {{a population of}} domestic albino brown rats to {{study the effects of}} diet and for other physiological studies. Over the years, rats have been used in many experimental studies, which have added to our understanding of genetics, diseases, the effects of drugs, and other topics that have provided a great benefit for the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> humankind. The aortic arches of the rat are among the most commonly studied in murine models due to marked anatomical homology to the human cardiovascular system. Both rat and human aortic arches exhibit subsequent branching of the brachiocephalic trunk, left common cartoid artery and left subclavian artery, as well as geometrically similar, non-planar curvature in the aortic branches. Aortic arches studied in rats exhibit abnormalities similar to those of humans, including altered pulmonary arteries and double or absent aortic arches. Despite existing anatomical analogy in the inthrathoracic position of the heart itself, the murine model of the heart and its structures remains a valuable tool for studies of human cardiovascular conditions.|$|E

25|$|The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), {{adopted in}} 1979 by the UN General Assembly and acceded to by 180 States, sets down rights for women, of freedom from {{discrimination}} and equality under the law. CEDAW has realized {{the rights and}} equality of woman is also {{the key to the}} survival and development of children and to building healthy families, communities and nations. Article 10 pinpoints nine changes that must be changed in order to help Nigerian women and other women suffering from gender disparity. It first states, their must be the same conditions for careers, vocational guidance, and for the achievement of diplomas in educational establishments of all categories in rural as well as in urban areas. This equality shall be ensured in pre-school, general, technical, professional and higher technical education, as well as in all types of vocational training. Second, is access to the same curricula, the same examinations, teaching staff with qualifications of the same standard and school premises and equipment of the same quality. Third, is the elimination of any stereotyped concept of the roles of men and women at all levels and in all forms of education. This is encouraged by coeducation and other types of education which will help to achieve this aim and, in particular, by the revision of textbooks and school programs and the adaptation of teaching methods. Fourth, the same opportunities to benefit from scholarships and other study grants. Similarly, fifth is the same opportunities of access to programs of continuing education, including adult and functional literacy programs, particularly those aimed at reducing, at the earliest possible time, any gap in education existing between men and women. Sixth, is the reduction of female student drop-out rates and the organization of programs for girls and women who have left school prematurely. Seventh concern listed is the same opportunities to participate actively in sports and physical education. Lastly, is access to specific educational information to help to ensure the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> families, including information and advice on family planning.|$|E
500|$|In 1995, {{the federal}} {{government}} announced the Aboriginal Right to Self-Government Policy. This policy recognizes that First Nations and Inuit have the constitutional right to shape their own forms of government to suit their particular historical, cultural, political and economic circumstances. The Indian Health Transfer Policy provided a framework for the assumption of control of health services by Aboriginal peoples, and set forth a developmental approach to transfer centred on self-determination in health. [...] Through this process, the decision to enter transfer discussions with Health Canada rests with each community. Once involved in transfer, communities can take control of health programme responsibilities at a pace determined by their individual circumstances and health management capabilities. [...] The National Aboriginal Health Organization (NAHO) incorporated in 2000, is an Aboriginal-designed and-controlled not-for-profit body in Canada that works to influence and advance the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> Aboriginal Peoples.|$|E
500|$|There {{are some}} {{inherent}} benefits to {{this form of}} custody arrangement. One main benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents are legal equals, which means that both parents influence important decisions in the child's upbringing, which leads to less animosity and negativity between the parents, along with encouraging both parents to be proactive in the child's upbringing. A second benefit of having joint legal custody is that the parents exhibit a feeling of well being knowing they are working together in making decisions based on what their child's/children's needs are. This form of joint custody enables parents to focus solely on the children, {{with the emphasis on}} the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>of</b> the child/children. [...] By doing so, this has the potential to reverse some of the emotional effects on the children in the long-run. [...] Another benefit of joint legal custody is that it fosters an environment in which the parents of the child have some form of a means of communication in which open dialogue can lead to ensuring a safe, nurturing environment for the child.|$|E
