5|$|An {{epilogue}} flashback scene soon {{reveals that}} Kelso {{had known about}} the stolen morphine and Sheldon's involvement, after they and their other fellow Marines found the surplus supply on their ship home. However, Kelso refused {{to be involved in}} Sheldon's scheme to sell the drugs along with the other Marines, telling them all that they will lose his respect for them as Marines <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> through with the drug profiting, setting in motion the events of the game.|$|E
5|$|The Nafana {{people say}} that they come from a village called Kakala in Ivory Coast. Their oral history says {{that some of their}} people are still there, and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> back they {{will not be allowed to}} leave again. They arrived in the Banda area after the Ligbi people, who came from Begho (Bigu, Bighu) to the area in the early 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Unusually in Japan, where photographers tend to join or form groups, Kikai {{has never}} been in any group, preferring to work by himself. When not setting out to take photographs, Kikai does not carry a camera with him. He leaves photographing his own family to his wife Noriko, and it is she who has the camera <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on a trip together.|$|E

25|$|Leo (Adam Levine) and Teresa (Jenna Dewan-Tatum) are two horror junkies visiting reputedly haunted {{sites on}} their honeymoon. They explore the Briarcliff Manor Sanitarium, an {{abandoned}} mental institution {{and once a}} tuberculosis hospital where many thousands died. Teresa having a fetish for the haunted, the couple begins having intercourse inside of the building. Teresa interrupts the session after hearing something move inside of the asylum, promising {{to make it up}} to Leo <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> investigate. They track down the sound to a locked door with a food hatch, through which Leo sticks his arm where it is severed by an undetermined cause.|$|E
25|$|Emiratis receive favorability in {{employment}} via the Emiratisation program forcing companies {{by law to}} limit the number of migrant workers in a company. This is done for the purposes of stabilizing the labor market and protecting the rights of this group as a minority in their own country. At the same time, however, due to the welfare benefits of the UAE government, many Emiratis are reluctant to take up low paying jobs especially those in the private sector; private sector employers are also generally more inclined to hire overseas temporary workers as they are cheaper and can be retrenched for various reasons, for example, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> on strike Most UAE locals also prefer government jobs and consider private sector jobs to be below them. Very few foreigners have been granted citizenship.|$|E

25|$|After {{the group}} reels with shock and grief, Rick tells a heartbroken Maggie, still {{suffering}} from pregnancy complications, {{that they need}} to get her to the Hilltop Colony's doctor. However, Maggie insists they all head back to Alexandria and prepare to fight. Rick counters, saying they will all die <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> after Negan and his army. The group insist on continuing to the Hilltop, but Maggie demands they do not follow her. Sasha (Sonequa Martin-Green) volunteers to escort Maggie to the Hilltop to recover, along with the bodies of Glenn and Abraham. As a walker slowly approaches, Rick picks up his axe and joins the others in the RV. Saddened, Rick has a vision of his entire group, including Abraham and Glenn as well as Maggie's yet-born child, enjoying a peaceful outdoor meal together in Alexandria, before coming back to reality. Through the right hand side view-mirror, Rick sees the walker eating the leftover blood remains of Glenn as he drives away.|$|E
500|$|Another {{consideration}} is loss of sensation, [...] which puts {{people at risk}} for wounds such as pressure sores and injuries that could become worse before being noticed. Friction from sexual activity may damage the skin, so it is necessary after sex to inspect areas {{that could have been}} hurt, particularly the buttocks and genital area. People who already have pressure sores must take care not to make the wounds worse. Irritation to the genitals increases risk for vaginal infections, which get worse <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> unnoticed. Women who do not get sufficient vaginal lubrication on their own can use a commercially available personal lubricant to decrease friction.|$|E
500|$|Later in the book, Duerr {{looks at}} ethnographic {{examples}} of shamanism, {{focusing on the}} shamanic use of hallucinogens and the experiences which such entheogens induce. He argues that [...] "archaic cultures" [...] recognize that a human can only truly understand themselves <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to the mental boundary between [...] "civilization" [...] and [...] "wilderness", {{and that it is}} this altered state of consciousness which both the shaman and the European witch reached in their visionary journeys. Believing that the modern western worldview failed to understand this process, Duerr criticizes the work of those anthropologists and scientists who had tried to understand [...] "archaic" [...] society through a western rationalist framework, instead advocating a return to [...] "archaic" [...] modes of thought.|$|E

500|$|Alone of the Ring's characters, the Rhinemaidens do not {{originate}} from [...] the Poetic Edda or Prose Edda, the Icelandic sources {{for most of}} Norse mythology. Water-sprites (German: Nixen) appear in many European myths and legends, often but not invariably in a form of disguised malevolence. Wagner drew widely and loosely from those legends when compiling his Ring narrative, and the probable origin of his Rhinemaidens is in the German Nibelungenlied. In {{one part of the}} Nibelungenlied narrative Hagen and Gunther encounter certain [...] "wise women" [...] (thereafter described as water-sprites), bathing and refreshing themselves in the waters of the Danube. Hagen creeps softly towards them, but he is seen, whereupon the sprites retreat and mock him from a distance. Hagen then steals their clothes. To obtain the return of these, one of the sprites, Hadeburg, promises falsely that Hagen and Gunther will find honor and glory when they enter Etzel's kingdom. After their clothes are returned, another sprite, Sigelinde (a name Wagner would adopt again for use elsewhere), tells Hagen that her sister has lied. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to Etzel's land, they will die there.|$|E
500|$|In July 1909 Davison {{was arrested}} with fellow suffragettes Mary Leigh and Alice Paul for {{interrupting}} a public meeting from which women were barred, {{held by the}} Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George; she was sentenced to two months for obstruction. She went on hunger strike and was released after {{five and a half}} days, during which time she lost she stated that she [...] "felt very weak" [...] as a result. She was arrested again in September the same year for throwing stones to break windows at a political meeting; the assembly, which was to protest at the 1909 budget, was only open to men. She was sent to Strangeways prison for two months. She again went on hunger strike and was released after two and a half days. She subsequently wrote to The Manchester Guardian to justify her action of throwing stones as one [...] "which was meant as a warning to the general public of the personal risk they run in future <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to Cabinet Ministers' meetings anywhere". She went on to write that this was justified because of the [...] "unconstitutional action of Cabinet Ministers in addressing 'public meetings' from which a large section of the public is excluded".|$|E
2500|$|The American folk {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Lead Belly commemorated {{the events in}} his song [...] "The Scottsboro Boys".

2500|$|In {{response}} to HB2, the Rowan-Salisbury Board of Education ruled on May 10, 2016 {{that students can}} carry pepper spray and mace. Board member Chuck Hughes said, [...] "Depending on how the courts rule on the bathroom issues, {{it may be a}} pretty valuable tool to have on the female students <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to the bathroom, not knowing who may come in." ...|$|E
2500|$|It was {{the third}} ranked {{opponent}} defeated by Texas in as many weeks. [...] The last time a team beat three teams ranked in the AP top 11 was Auburn in 1983. [...] ESPN's Beano Cook said, [...] "What Texas is doing is unbelievable. [...] <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> undefeated, they should {{go straight to the}} Super Bowl." [...] When he was asked to recall a more difficult run, Cook replied, [...] "the Marines in the South Pacific." ...|$|E
2500|$|Priests are {{commonly}} known as Santeros or Olorichas. Once those priests have initiated other priests, they become known as babalorichás, [...] "fathers of orichá" [...] (for men), and as iyalorichás, [...] "mothers of orichá" [...] (for women). Priests can commonly be referred to as Santeros (male) and Santeras (female), and if they function as diviners (using cowrie-shell divination known as Dilogun) of the Orichás they can be considered Italeros, or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> through training to become leaders of initiations, Obas or Oriates.|$|E

2500|$|Rankin v McPherson, 483 U.S. 378 (1987) 5 to 4, a Texas deputy constable had a First Amendment {{right to}} say, after the {{assassination}} attempt on Ronald Reagan [...] "Shoot, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> for him again, I hope they get him." [...] Dismissal was unlawful {{and she had to}} be reinstated because even extreme comments (except potentially advocating actual murder) against a political figure should be protected.

2500|$|I {{can speak}} {{endlessly}} of myself, to myself or to someone else, without ever succeeding in giving {{a complete and}} truthful picture of myself... The same thing happens with all these {{people who come to}} see me, and take so much trouble over their efforts to describe themselves to me with strict accuracy; inevitably I form an image of them which derives as much from myself as from them. [...] <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> and see one of my colleagues he will certainly not see them exactly as I do. And they for their part will not show themselves to him in the same way they show themselves to me.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2001, Zhang was {{transferred}} to the eastern coastal province of Shandong to become governor. He began serving as provincial party chief, the first-in-charge of the province, beginning in 2002. In Shandong, Zhang told a gathering of assembled local officials, [...] "whether it is my relatives, children, friends; <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>go</b> to where you are, please do not go out of your way to receive them, do not curry favour with them, and do not offer to do things for them." [...] This was seen as Zhang trying to send a signal that he intended to distance himself from a political culture rife with corruption and complex rules around guanxi. In Shandong, Zhang was known to conduct 'undercover visits' to survey the lives of ordinary people. When Zhang left office, Shandong's GDP had exceeded 2 trillion yuan (~$300 billion), ranking second among provinces in the country.|$|E
