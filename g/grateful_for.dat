5|$|Along {{with the}} other LCL hopefuls, Playford journeyed around the {{electorate}} advocating his platform.

With a split in the Labor vote, the first LCL government was formed with Richard Layton Butler as Premier.|$|E

5|$|The large Polish {{emigrant}} {{communities in}} North America, Western Europe, and elsewhere, were politically active and lent significant support to those struggling in the country.

5|$|Zhao Mo was <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> {{the speed}} of the {{intervention}} against Minyue. The Han official Zhuang Zhu was dispatched to meet with the Nanyue emperor, who expressed his gratitude. Zhao sent his son, the prince Zhao Yingqi, to the Han capital at Chang'an, where he was to work for the Emperor. In the aftermath of the campaign, Minyue had split into a dual monarchy, Minyue and Dongyue. Minyue was controlled by the Han through a proxy ruler, while Dongyue was independently ruled by Zou Yushan, the brother who deposed the former king during the invasion.|$|E
5|$|At {{a luncheon}} later that day, however, Miranda announces {{that it is}} Jacqueline instead of Nigel who will leave Runway for Holt. Nigel remarks to a stunned Andy that, though disappointed, he has to believe that his loyalty to Miranda will one day pay off. Later, when Miranda and Andy are being driven to a show, she {{explains}} to a still-stunned Andy that she was <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the warning but already knew of the plot to replace her and sacrificed Nigel to keep her own job. Pleased by this display of loyalty, she tells Andy that she sees {{a great deal of}} herself in her. Andy, repulsed, says she could never do that to anyone. Miranda replies that she already did, stepping over Emily when she agreed to go to Paris. When they stop, Andy gets out and throws her cell phone into the fountain of the Place de la Concorde, leaving Miranda, Runway, and fashion behind.|$|E

5|$|Henson's 1960s {{talk show}} {{appearances}} culminated when he devised Rowlf, a piano-playing anthropomorphic dog. Rowlf {{became the first}} Muppet to make regular appearances on a network show, The Jimmy Dean Show. Henson was so <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> this break that he offered Jimmy Dean a 40% interest in his production company, but Dean declined, stating that Henson deserved all the rewards for his own work, a decision of conscience Dean never regretted. From 1963 to 1966, Henson began exploring film-making and produced a series of experimental films. His nine-minute experimental film, Time Piece, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Live Action Short Film in 1966. The year 1969 saw the production of The Cube, another Henson-produced experimental movie.|$|E
5|$|Picard confronts Q, {{who tells}} him that {{although}} the bout with the Nausicaan nearly cost him his life, it also gave him a sense of his mortality. It taught him that life was too precious to squander by playing it safe. Picard realizes that his attempts to suppress and ignore {{the consequences of his}} indiscretions have resulted in him losing a part of himself. Picard then declares that he would rather die as captain of the Enterprise than live as a nobody. Q sends him back to the bar fight and events unfold as they did originally, with Picard being stabbed through the heart and laughing as he collapses to the floor. In the present, Picard awakens in sickbay, a Captain again. As Picard recovers from his injury, he wonders if his journey into the past was one of Q's tricks or merely a dream. Nevertheless, he is <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the insight the experience gave him.|$|E

5|$|The {{text of the}} cantata {{is taken}} from a 1704 {{collection}} of librettos from Meiningen, many {{of which had been}} set to music in the cantatas of Bach's distant cousin Johann Ludwig Bach, Capellmeister at Meiningen. The librettos have been attributed to his employer Duke Ernst Ludwig von Sachsen-Meiningen. The symmetrical structure of seven movements is typical for this collection: the opening quotation from the Old Testament, followed by a recitative and an aria; then the central quotation from the New Testament, followed by an aria and a recitative, leading into the final chorale. The theme of BWV 39 is an invocation to be <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> God's gifts and to share them with the needy.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{material}} written about her was aimed at children, and {{tended to focus on}} her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. She has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in The French Lieutenant's Woman (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime. As her biographer, Shelley Emling, noted, this contrasted with some of the prominent geologists who had used her finds, such as William Buckland and Roderick Murchison, who ended up with multiple fossil species named after them. The only person who did name a species after her during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after her—Acrodus anningiae, and Belenostomus anningiae—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After her death, other species, including the ostracod Cytherelloidea anningi, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus Anningia, and the bivalve mollusc genus Anningella, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus Anningasaura was named for her, and the species Ichthyosaurus anningae was named for her in 2015.|$|E
5|$|On 14 November 2007, it was {{announced}} that former EastEnders scriptwriter Tony Jordan had been contacted by Controller of BBC Drama Production John Yorke with an idea for an episode and that Jordan had returned to EastEnders having written the script for the episode. The single-hander episode {{was announced}} the next day, the first episode of any soap opera to feature just one character. Jordan had wanted to write a solo episode for EastEnders – well known for its two-hander episodes – for some time, but the opportunity had never arisen until Bardon had a stroke in real life, which was reflected in storyines when Jim was said to have suffered a stroke when visiting relatives off screen. Cast and crew were <b>grateful</b> <b>for</b> the opportunity to make the episode but were aware it had come about due to the suffering of somebody they loved. Brown was initially sceptical that her character could carry an entire episode by herself, but stated that Dot has a lot of history so there was a lot to call upon.|$|E
