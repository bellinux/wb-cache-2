5|$|Also bird banding. The {{attachment}} of a small, individually numbered {{metal or}} plastic tag to the leg or wing {{of a wild}} bird to enable individual identification. This helps in {{keeping track of the}} movements of the bird and its life history. Upon capture for ringing, it is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather , amount of subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex. The subsequent recapture or recovery of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Bird ringing is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe; while the term bird banding is more often used in the U.S. and Australia.|$|E

5|$|Frigatebirds will rob other seabirds such as boobies, {{particularly}} the red-footed booby, tropicbirds, shearwaters, petrels, terns, gulls and even ospreys of their catch, using their speed and manoeuvrability to outrun and harass their victims until they regurgitate their stomach contents.

Although frigatebirds are renowned for their kleptoparasitic <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviour,</b> kleptoparasitism is not thought to play {{a significant part of}} the diet of any species, and is instead a supplement to food obtained by hunting. A study of great frigatebirds stealing from masked boobies estimated that the frigatebirds could at most obtain 40% of the food they needed, and on average obtained only 5%.|$|E

5|$|Skeletal {{elements}} of the upper jaw {{appear to have been}} rhynchokinetic (movable in relation to each other), which must have affected its <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviour.</b> In extant birds, such as frugivorous (fruit-eating) pigeons, kinetic premaxillae help with consuming large food items.

In 2016, the first 3D endocast was made from the brain of the dodo; examination found that though the brain was similar to that of other pigeons in most respects, the dodo had a comparatively large olfactory bulb. This gave the dodo a good sense of smell, which may have aided in locating fruit and small prey.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} several {{theories}} proposed for why the phylloxera was ignored as the possible cause of the disease {{that resulted in the}} failure of so many vineyards, most of which involve the <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> of the insect, and the way it attacks the roots. The proboscis of the grape phylloxera has both a venom canal from which it injects its deadly venom and a feeding tube through which it takes in vine sap and nutrients. As the toxin from the venom corrodes the root structure of a vine, the sap pressure falls and, as a result, the Phylloxera quickly withdraws its feeding tube and searches for another source of food. Thus, anyone digging up a diseased and dying vine will not find Phylloxera clinging to the roots of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Osmólska and Roniewicz {{reported}} that the holotype specimen has abnormal pits, grooves and tubercles on {{the first and second}} phalanx of the left second finger that {{may be the result of}} injuries to the joint between the two bones. The damage may have caused changes to the arrangement of ligaments of muscles. The two coracoids are also differently developed. A rib of specimen MPC-D 100/127 shows a healed trauma which has remodelled the bone. In 2012, bite marks on two gastralia of the holotype specimen were reported. The size and shape of the bite marks match the teeth of Tarbosaurus, the largest known predator from the Nemegt Formation. Various types of feeding traces were identified; punctures, gouges, striae, fragmentary teeth, and combinations of the above marks. The bite marks probably represent <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> instead of aggression between the species, and the fact that bite marks were not found elsewhere on the body indicates the predator focused on internal organs. Tarbosaurus bite marks have also been identified on hadrosaur and sauropod fossils, but theropod bite marks on bones of other theropods are very rare in the fossil record.|$|E

5|$|Seabirds {{have made}} {{numerous}} adaptations to living on and feeding in the sea. Wing morphology {{has been shaped}} by the niche an individual species or family has evolved, so that looking at a wing's shape and loading can tell a scientist about its life <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Longer wings and low wing loading are typical of more pelagic species, while diving species have shorter wings. Species such as the wandering albatross, which forage over huge areas of sea, have a reduced capacity for powered flight and are dependent on a type of gliding called dynamic soaring (where the wind deflected by waves provides lift) as well as slope soaring. Seabirds also almost always have webbed feet, to aid movement on the surface as well as assisting diving in some species. The Procellariiformes are unusual among birds in having {{a strong sense of}} smell, which is used to find widely distributed food in a vast ocean, and possibly to locate their colonies.|$|E

40|$|Lateralized {{behaviour}} {{refers to}} a preference for using a specific limb or direction of movement that is consistent across events. We investigated apparent lateralized behaviour in North Atlantic humpback whales, Megaptera novaeangliae, in the southern Gulf of Maine using digital acoustic tag (‘DTAG’) technology to analyse <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> during 2004 – 2009. An ideal tool to examine lateralized behaviours, DTAGs allowed continuous measurements of whale depth, heading, pitch and roll throughout the attachment period (less than 24 h). Side preference (right or left) in rolling behaviours (e. g. bottom rolling and side lunging) and directional preference (clockwise or anticlockwise) in <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> such as looping and spiraling were determined from visual examination of DTAG data. A ‘handedness index’ (HI) was used to quantify side bias and strength of preference. We found a population-level right-side bias similar to the 90 / 10 right-hand bias in humans. Furthermore, photos of jaw scuffing and direct tag data on rolling behaviour were used to assign a bottom-rolling side preference for 11 individuals for whom both of these data were available, 10 (90. 9 %) of which demonstrated a right-side bias. Consistent laterality was observed between individuals that performed bottom rolling and directional <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours,</b> which was biased in the right/clockwise direction. Younger individuals tended to show weaker lateralization scores than older individuals, even among adults (P = 0. 048), suggesting that lateralization develops, and continues to do so, beyond sexual maturity...|$|R
40|$|Infant <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> {{impact upon}} {{maternal}} {{and child health}} not only in the short term but throughout the lifespan. Large scale cohort studies show that that mothers migrating to the United Kingdom (UK) are more likely to practise healthy behaviours on arrival than after settlement, with mothers 5 % less likely to breastfeed to 4 months for every additional 5 years spent in the UK 1. Despite the potential impact upon the health of babies and their mothers, there is currently little exploration of the breastfeeding and weaning behaviours of migrant mothers in empirical research, and to date there have been few attempts in practice to address this decrease in healthy infant <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> among this growing sector of the population. Jayaweera 2 highlights that current research and policy are predominantly concerned with ethnic equalities in health, rarely considering the specific impact of migration. Additionally the health needs of refugees and asylum seekers have attracted more research than the health needs of those who come to study or work, and those from more established groups. This paper explores infant <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> among a variety of migrant groups and is based upon two qualitative studies carried out in South West England between 2013 and 2015. Romanian Roma mothers and grandmothers (n = 22) took part in semi-structured interviews focused on breastfeeding and weaning {{in the first year of}} life, taking into account social norms within their ethnic group and the effect of moving to the UK on individual and community normative behaviours. Mono-cultural focus groups were held with parents (n = 28) who had migrated to the UK within the last ten years, and discussion centred on how parents keep their pre-school children healthy in the UK following recent migration from EU accession countries, Somalia and South Asia. Both studies contribute to a highly nuanced picture of how infant <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> are influenced by the context of family life post-migration. Participants described work, study, family and community as impacting upon the choices parents made about how to feed their babies. Findings illustrate the differences in the context of daily life, both intra- and inter -nationalities, which drive change in the country of adoption. <b>Feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> were particularly shaped by socio-economic status pre and post-migration. These findings add to the existing body of research about infant feeding among migrant mothers, providing in-depth contextual detail around the influence of migration in addition to ethnicity. It is known that moving to the UK from another culture can lead to changes in lifestyle, which have a long term impact upon the health of children. This study contributes to an understanding of infant feeding practices, beliefs and choices among migrant parents, and the factors which shape them. This provides insights for health professionals, researchers and commissioners who seek to promote better health for migrants and their children...|$|R
25|$|The red {{imported}} {{fire ant}} {{is a significant}} agricultural pest in areas where it is not native. They are capable of damaging crops, and they threaten pastures and orchards. The mounds themselves can destroy agricultural equipment such as irrigation systems and damage machinery during harvest time. The ants are known to invade soybean crops causing lower yields, and could cause $156 million in losses for soybean crops in the southeastern United States. Reports from Georgia and North Carolina claim that 16.8 to 49.1kg/ha of soybeans could not be harvested due to interference from fire ant mounds; combine harvesters skipped over the mounds preventing the crops from being harvested, and farmers raised the cutter bars on their combine harvesters to avoid impacting the mounds. The <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> of red imported fire ants can result in significant damage to many other crops, including: beans, cabbage, citrus, corn, cucumber, eggplant, okra, peanut, potato, sorghum, sunflower, and sweet potato. The ants also interfere with plants' root systems and feed on young growth. Sometimes, colonies build mounds around or near the base of citrus trees chew off new growth and feed on the flowers or developing fruit. Citrus trees are often girdled or killed.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{explanation for}} the Black Death is the plague theory, which attributes the outbreak to Yersinia pestis, also responsible for an epidemic that began in southern China in 1865, eventually spreading to India. The investigation of the pathogen that caused the 19th-century plague was begun by teams of scientists who visited Hong Kong in 1894, among whom was the French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, after whom the pathogen was named Yersinia pestis. The mechanism by which Y. pestis was usually transmitted was established in 1898 by Paul-Louis Simond and was found to involve the bites of fleas whose midguts had become obstructed by replicating Y. pestis several days after feeding on an infected host. This blockage results in starvation and aggressive <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviour</b> by the fleas, which repeatedly attempt to clear their blockage by regurgitation, resulting in thousands of plague bacteria being flushed into the feeding site, infecting the host. The bubonic plague mechanism was also dependent on two populations of rodents: one resistant to the disease, which act as hosts, keeping the disease endemic, and a second that lack resistance. When the second population dies, the fleas {{move on to other}} hosts, including people, thus creating a human epidemic.|$|E

40|$|While endocannabinoid-mediated {{regulations}} of <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> are generally attributed to neuronal expression of CB 1 cannabinoid receptor (CB 1), recent data suggested {{the participation of}} astrocyte-dependent mechanisms. Therefore, by generating a mouse line in which the CB 1 gene was conditionally disrupted from GFAP-positive cells (GFAP-CB 1 -KO mice), we herein show that astroglial CB 1 partially controls <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Thus, deletion of CB 1 from GFAP-positive cells leads to a reduction of basal food intake. Because the expression of receptor for leptin (ObR), a key peripheral hormone regulating energy balance has been recently reported on astrocytes, we further examined whether cannabinoid and leptin systems could interact at astroglial level and possibly contribute to the CB 1 -GFAP-KO mouse phenotype. As expected, ObR was detected in primary astrocytes. However, a severe reduction of ObR expression was observed either in cultures derived from full CB 1 -KO mice or in WT cultures exposed to rimonabant. Accordingly, the evaluation of leptin-mediated STAT phosphorylations {{as well as the}} leptin-stimulated glycogen accumulation further indicated that CB 1 deficiency abolishes leptin-mediated functions. Finally, to investigate the physiological significance of the astrocytic CB 1 -dependent impairment of leptin system, we injected leptin in WT and GFAP-CB 1 -KO mice. As expected, leptin induced significant reductions of both food intake and body weight of WT animals. However, this treatment only slightly reduces food consumption by GFAP-CB 1 -/- mice which however displayed a considerable reduction of body weight. Altogether, these results reveal a crucial role of astroglial CB 1 receptor in <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours.</b> Particularly, our data evidence a direct control of this receptor on leptin-mediated functions in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, beyond the investigation of astroglial CB 1 functions, this study clearly supports direct involvement of astrocytes in basal physiological processes...|$|R

40|$|Poor {{childhood}} diet is a {{major risk}} factor for disease and obesity, and parents of pre-school children are in a powerful position to influence diet for life. The technique of thematic synthesis (Thomas & Harden, 2008) was used to synthesise recent qualitative research on parental feeding of pre-school age children (18 months – 6 years). The aim was to inform development of nutrition advice by gaining a comprehensive picture of parental <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> and motivations. Six key parental <b>feeding</b> <b>behaviours</b> were identified: modelling, rewards, pressure and encouragement, repeated exposure, creativity, and limiting intake. Four overarching themes regarding motivations were identified: promoting good health (balance and variety, and weight control); building positive relationships (child involvement, and parental engagement and responsiveness); practicalities and constraints (time, cost, and lack of culinary skill, and pressure and flexibility); and emotional motivations (problem avoidance, and emotional investment). Practicalities and constraints, and emotional motivations impacted more significantly on low income parents. In order to be effective, nutrition advice ought to tap into parents’ strong desire to build positive relationships and promote good health while remaining sensitive to the significant constraints and practicalities faced...|$|R

The frequency of maternal ADAs varied between nationalities, and, contrary to current advice, did not relate negatively to infant willingness to eat.
