The serpentinites are characterized by high concentration of fluid-mobile elements (FME: As, Sb, B, Li, and U) compared to ophiolitic or abyssal serpentinites. The Pb isotopic compositions of serpentinites show influence of the subducted Indian continental lithosphere. Trace element concentrations of antigorite determined in situ with Laser Ablation High Resolution <b>Inductively</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (LA-HR-ICP-MS) show high contents of FME including Pb, in contrast to the spatially associated iron oxides. Rare earth elements (REE) and compatible elements, such as Sc and Co, remained immobile during the hydration, allowing the identification of the primary minerals (olivine or orthopyroxene) from which serpentine formed. Serpentinized olivine displays higher Sb and As concentrations (up to 1000 x PM) than serpentinized orthopyroxenes that are enriched in Pb, Cs and Li (2 to up to 10 x PM).;We propose that the observed FME distribution in two types of serpentine reflect the differential incorporation of FME during the downward movement of the serpentinite along the subduction plane. At temperature lower than 400 degrees C, at shallow depths, olivine is preferentially serpentinized and incorporates elements that are fluid soluble at low temperatures, such as Sb and As. Above 400 degrees C, orthopyroxene is hydrated and incorporates Pb, Cs, Li and possibly Ba. Boron and U are incorporated in both types of serpentine suggesting that they are released from slabs at temperatures around 300 - 400 degrees C. The serpentine acts as a sink for water, but also for FME and transports them to deeper and hotter levels in the mantle, down to the isotherm 600 - 650 degrees C where dehydration occurs...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAn <b>inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> plasma—time-of-flight <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (ICP-TOFMS) {{has been}} {{constructed}} and evaluated for elemental analysis. The instrument produces analog spectra {{similar to those}} from quadrupole <b>inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> plasma <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometers.</b> The large abundance of Ar ions is deflected away from the microchannel plate detector to reduce detector dead time and space-charge complications. The ICP-TOFMS, operated in a linear (nonreflecting) mode, currently has a resolving power of 500 (full width at half maximum). Present ion optics employed in the instrument require a trade-off between signal-to-noise ratio and resolving power. In addition, mass-dependent kinetic energies in the supersonic beam created in the ICP <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> interface cause a mass bias in the right-angle TOFMS because the ions must be steered to the detector to compensate for their velocity in the supersonic beam direction. In the current design the sampling duty cycle is only approximately 3 %, thereby limiting sensitivity. However, positive potentials applied to the right-angle extraction region can increase sensitivity {{by a factor of}} 2 – 4 by slowing down the ions that enter the extraction zone.

40|$|Laser {{ablation}} {{refers to}} the explosive process by which a solid sample is vaporized though a violent laser-material interaction resulting in a plume of atoms, ions, and molecules. It has been demonstrated that an increase in sensitivity and selectivity of an analyte {{can be achieved by}} tuning the laser wavelength to match that of a resonant gas phase transition of the analyte. Tuning the ablation laser to such a wavelength has been termed Resonant Laser Ablation (RLA). Chapter 1 contains a review of the current theory and applications of RLA. ^ The analytical utility of RLA is hindered by the lack of understanding of the mechanism by which this enhancement occurs and an uncontrollable ablation process. Chapter 2 outlines both resonant and non-resonant interactions in both the Chemistry and Physics literature lending insight into factors that might have been overlooked in the description of the currently accepted theory of RLA. ^ The data presented in Chapter 3 demonstrates the enhancement effect of trace metals in stainless steel samples, and pure copper and aluminum samples in both ablation wavelength scans and emission scans. Optical and SEM images illustrate changes in surface morphology as the laser wavelength approaches the resonant wavelength of the target material. Based on this date, a mechanism is presented in Chapter 4 to account for the increase in atomic signal, as well as a distinct laser-material interaction. ^ Chapter 5 explores a wide range of applications of Near Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) in various fields of analytical chemistry, taking advantage of its inherent rapid analysis time and minimal sample preparation. A novel PbS spectrometer is also characterized using a variety of samples demonstrating its usefulness as an analytical tool and also it 2 ̆ 7 s shortcomings and limitations. ^ Appendix A outlines detailed experiments for the coupling of RLA with an <b>Inductively</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (ICP-MS) {{through the use of a}} novel cell design.

40|$|The second chapter {{handles the}} measurement. These are often {{collected}} with a Laser Ablation <b>Inductively</b> <b>Coupled</b> <b>Mass</b> <b>Spectrometer</b> (LA-ICP-MS) {{and the first}} problem we encountered was the calibration of this instrument. It is used to measure trace elements with an incredibly high spatial resolution. Of course, it has also some major disadvantages. One of these is that the laser, {{which is used to}} ablate the solid substrate, has a variable intensity. In addition several other internal instrumental parameters seem to vary over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, people use internal standards for more than twenty years. Such internal standards are elements whose concentration does not vary over the sample. Consequently,all variation detected in these internal standards must be due to artificial variation in the instrument. Because the drift of the instrument is reflected in the measurementofthe internal standard, all other concentrationscan be calibratedaccordingto this internal standard. This simple idea seems to work quite well. Unfortunately, the calibration algorithm {{does not take into account}} measurement noise in the signal of the internal standards. This is exactly the improvement that we made: imagine two internal standards, each consisting of the same drift pattern, and disturbed by a different noise pattern. A better approximation of the true drift pattern can be reached by the arithmetic mean of both internal standards. Hereinthe drift remains and the noise cancels out. This idea is further refined, so that the uncertainty on the internal standards can be taken into account as well, and an a priori and an a posteriori verification of the model used is given. Further, the myth of mass dependent internal standards is ruled out and finally a real world example is processed. An additional important property of the proposed calibration is that an internal quality check is performed, which warns the investigator if some artefacts or problems occurred during the measurement. The remaining part of this work is devoted to the reconstruction of time series. One of the major problems with data-processing of proxy records (e. g. stable isotope ratios of oxygen or carbon, or trace elements in shells, sponges, corals, sediment cores, etc) is the dating of individual observations. All these proxy records are measured as function of a distance, while generally the time series are desired. Due to variations and differences in accretion rate, each record has its unique distance series, which cannot be compared with other records or models. Therefore, distance series are transformed into time series. However, this is only possible if additional information about the accretion rate is available. Unfortunately, this is mostly not the case and thus additional assumptions are necessary. Such assumption can be made about the signal and formally written down in the signal model. In addition,the concept of a time base distortion is introduced. As will be shown,this enables us to estimate variations in accretion rate. For this, we started from a previously estimated time base (if this is unknown, we initialize the time base assuming a constant accretion rate). Next, we allow this base to be distorted due to nonlinear accretion rates or hiatuses and we will show how such a distortion can be estimated. In the third chapter, we have illustrated how the time series can be reconstructed, assuming a periodic proxy-record. Therefore, the concept of time base distortions is introduced. First, we propose a model for variations in accretion rate. Next, we illustrate how this accretion rate can be identified and estimated in the Fourier spectrum of the proxy. This approach is compared with the widely used anchor point method in two manners: the assumptions made are compared and next the sensitivity of both methods w. r. t. stochastic noise is illustrated on a simulation. Three case studies are incorporated to validate the method and to illustrate its use...|$|E

The organometallic compounds were in situ derivatized with sodium tetraethylborate, sorbed on a poly(dimethylsiloxane) -coated fused silica fiber, and desorbed in the splitless injection port of the GC. The different organometallic compounds were simultaneously determined by an <b>inductively</b> <b>coupled</b> plasma <b>mass</b> <b>spectrometer</b> (ICPMS) <b>coupled</b> to the GC using a transfer line developed in-house. The detection limits obtained with CGC-ICPMS for monobutyl-, dibutyl-, and tributyltin are between 0. 34 and 2. 1 ng/L as Sn. Analysis of a PACS- 1 reference material confirmed {{the reliability of the}} combination of SPME as extraction technique with CGC-ICPMS for the analysis of organotin compounds...|$|R
