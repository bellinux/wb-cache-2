5|$|By {{the time}} the United States of America entered the war in 1917—three {{years after the first}} shots were fired—several Americans <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> to fight as pilots by joining the Royal Flying Corps. These pilots {{reported}} to Canada, and after flight training were sent to fight as officers in the British military.|$|E
5|$|Third class {{passengers}} were {{a diverse group}} of nationalities and ethnic groups. In addition to large numbers of British, Irish, and Scandinavian immigrants, there were passengers from Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East (primarily Lebanon and Syria) and Hong Kong. Some travelled alone or in small family groups. Several groups of mothers were travelling alone with their young children—most going to join their husbands who <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> to America to find jobs, and, having saved up enough money, could now send for their families.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the attack, Major Ormsby advanced from Fort Erie to Frenchman’s Creek with his 80 men of the 49th Regiment, where he was joined by Lieutenant McIntyre’s 70 light infantrymen, Major Hatt’s Lincoln Militia and some British-allied Native Americans under Major Givins. Finding that Boerstler’s invaders <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone,</b> and being unable to determine any other enemy presence in the pitch dark, Ormsby’s 300 men remained in position until daybreak, when Lieutenant Colonel Bisshopp arrived from Fort Erie. Bisshopp led the force to the Red House, where they found Captain King and his men still waiting to be evacuated. Outnumbered by ten-to-one, King surrendered.|$|E

5|$|At {{their first}} series of {{meetings}} on 14 September, the Night Defence Committee began collecting a series of suggestions for improvements, which were discussed in depth on 1 October. These were passed on to Dowding for implementation, but he found that many of their suggestions were already out of date. For instance, they suggested building new radars {{that could be used}} over land, allowing the fight to continue throughout the raid. A contract for this type of radar had already been sent out in June or July. They suggested that the filter room at RAF Bentley Priory be devolved down to the Group headquarters to improve the flow of information, but Dowding <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> a step further and devolved night interception to the Sector level at the airfields. Dowding accepted only four of the suggestions.|$|E
5|$|Over ten {{thousand}} stores across forty countries opened for the midnight launch of Halo 4. On {{the evening before}} {{the release of the}} game, a fifty-foot diameter illuminated Didact glyph was flown by a helicopter over the River Thames in London, from the Greenwich Peninsula to Tower Bridge. The glyph was created by a team of over fifty designers, engineers and fabricators and took approximately eight weeks to design and construct. Following the release of the game, New Zealand censors declared many copies of Halo 4 illegal, after deciding to label it with an R13 rating, restricting it to buyers aged 13 and over. Many copies of the game <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> on sale with an unrestricted M certificate, but these copies are in breach of the Films, Videos, and Publications Classification Act 1993.|$|E
5|$|On September 11, 2001, United Airlines Flight 93 was hijacked by {{four members}} of al-Qaeda {{as part of the}} September 11 attacks. The hijackers' {{specific}} target was the United States Capitol. Among the pilots available that day of the 113th Wing of the DC Air National Guard were Lieutenant Colonel Marc H. Sasseville and Lieutenant Heather Penney Garcia. They were given the mission of finding the United Airlines Flight 93 and destroying it however they could. Since the fighter jets were absent of missiles and packed only with dummy ammunition from a recent training mission, {{there was only one way}} to do it and that was by ramming the aircraft. The fighter jets passed over the ravaged Pentagon building, however it was not until hours later that they would find out that United 93 <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> down in a field outside Shanksville, Pennsylvania, killing all 44 people aboard including the 4 hijackers.|$|E

5|$|Next, a small {{metallic}} dingy, {{known as}} an iron yawl, was carried down to the beach. Tom Fagen and Freed Waterhouse manned the yawl, in another attempt to reach the grounded schooner. Through skilled seamanship, they {{made it to the}} second set of breakers, only a short distance from the vessel. When they tried to reach the float line, a large wave struck them leaving their boat filled with water. The two men abandoned their yawl. Fagen managed to swim ashore and was met by volunteers close to the beach half-drowned. Waterhouse decided against swimming to shore. When he saw that the yawl had flipped, he swam back to it and straddled the hull. The men on the shore began pulling the flipped boat in, but another wave broke on top of it throwing Waterhouse into the water and righting the yawl. Waterhouse climbed back into the boat and began getting pulled in again, only to be capsized shortly thereafter. This time Waterhouse surfaced, appearing dazed and grasping onto an oar. Shaw's rescue boat was put back in the water, but Waterhouse <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> under and presumably drowned to death a short time later. F Waterhouse's body was never recovered, despite several searches.|$|E

25|$|When {{the buses}} began rolling again on April 19, the line's opening was rolled back to June 26.

He was sent there {{to be with a}} cousin but he <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> to the University of Königsberg. The sixteen-year-old Georg Ludwig set off to Königsberg, to find his cousin and on the way he met a recruiter for the Prussian army, who persuaded him to become an officer. He joined Cuirassier Regiment no. 4. In 1740 under the new King Frederick II of Prussia, he became the oldest lieutenant at the Hussars Regiment No. 3 (Köhler).|$|E
25|$|In 1190 Philip {{took the}} cross {{for a second}} time and joined the Flemish contingents which <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> to Palestine. After {{arriving}} at the Siege of Acre, he was stricken by the epidemic passing through the crusader camp, and died on 1 August 1191. His body was brought back to Flanders by his wife, who acted as regent during his absence. Philip was buried in Clairvaux Abbey. Since he was unsuccessful in producing an heir with Countess Matilda, he was succeeded by his sister Margaret and his brother-in-law, Baldwin, who thereupon ruled as Baldwin VII of Flanders.|$|E
25|$|Profumo's {{statement}} did {{not prevent}} newspapers publishing stories about Keeler, and it soon became apparent to Macmillan that Profumo's position was untenable. On 5 June 1963, Profumo was forced {{to admit that he}} had lied to the House, an unforgivable offence in British politics. He resigned from office, from the House, and from the Privy Council. Before making his public confession Profumo confessed the affair to his wife, who stood by him. It was never shown that his relationship with Keeler had led to any breach of national security. The scandal rocked the Conservative government, and was generally held to have been among the causes of its defeat by Labour at the 1964 election. Macmillan <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> by then, having resigned in October 1963 to be succeeded by Alec Douglas-Home.|$|E

25|$|Dennis Priestley and Phil Taylor {{have played}} {{each other in}} five World Finals, with Priestley winning in 1994 and Taylor {{emerging}} victorious in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 2000. During {{the early years of}} the WDC, Priestley and Taylor had an agreement where they would share prize money won at events. Following the split in darts, the players <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> through large expenses to fight court cases that would last until 1997 when they were finally able to overturn a ban by the British Darts Organisation. Their arrangement lasted between 1994 and 2000 and made sound financial sense given that one or the other generally delivered success in the immediate years after the split. The agreement eventually ended when the prize money grew to a level where the players could individually sustain a better living and this ironically coincided with Priestley's sharp dip in form.|$|E
25|$|When {{switching}} {{to the use}} of national teams in 1930, the costs of accommodating riders fell to the organizers instead of the sponsors and Henri Desgrange raised the money by allowing advertisers to precede the race. The procession of often colourfully decorated trucks and cars became known as the publicity caravan. It formalised an existing situation, companies having started to follow the race. The first to sign to precede the Tour was the chocolate company, Menier, one of those who had followed the race. Its head of publicity, Paul Thévenin, had first put the idea to Desgrange. It paid 50,000 old francs. Preceding the race was more attractive to advertisers because spectators gathered by the road long before the race or could be attracted from their houses. Advertisers following the race found that many who had watched the race <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> home. Menier handed out tons of chocolate in that first year of preceding the race, as well as 500,000 policemen's hats printed with the company's name. The success led to the caravan's existence being formalised the following year.|$|E
25|$|Most books either receive {{immediate}} {{attention in the}} market, or fail. The successful sell most of their copies {{within a year or}} two of publication. Now and then a book sells well and continues to sell for many years. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings were drastic exceptions to both patterns. Both works sold enough to induce the publishers to continue printing, but for the first twenty-five years of The Hobbit's life, and the first ten years of that of The Lord of the Rings, sales {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic amounted to little more than a few thousand copies per year. It was not until the mid-1960s that social trends flowered into an acceptance and even hunger for the modern fantasy, which Tolkien had developed so long before almost on his own. Formerly an obscure author, Tolkien exploded into popularity. Despite the fact that The Hobbit <b>had</b> <b>already</b> <b>gone</b> through fifteen printing runs and two distinct editions by then, suddenly all of them were collectible. By that time, printing presses were churning out more copies every year than had been sold those first twenty-five.|$|E
