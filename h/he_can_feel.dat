5|$|Furious {{that her}} ploy has failed, Kundry tells Parsifal that if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> {{compassion}} for Amfortas, {{then he should}} be able to feel it for her as well. She has been cursed for centuries, unable to rest, because she saw Christ on the cross and laughed at His pains. Now she can never weep, only jeer, and she is enslaved to Klingsor as well. Parsifal rejects her again but then asks her to lead him to Amfortas. She begs him to stay with her for just one hour, and then she will take him to Amfortas. When he still refuses, she curses him to wander without ever finding the Kingdom of the Grail, and finally calls on her master Klingsor to help her.|$|E
25|$|The blade may {{not have}} {{imperfections}} in it. All blades are assumed by Jewish law to be imperfect, so the knife must be checked before each session. In the past the knife was checked {{through a variety of}} means. Today the common practice is for the shochet to run his fingernail up and down both sides of the blade and on the cutting edge to determine if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> any imperfections. He then uses a number of increasingly fine abrasive stones to sharpen and polish the blade until it is perfectly sharp and smooth. After the slaughter, the shochet must check the knife again in the same way to be certain the first inspection was properly done, and to ensure the blade was not damaged during shechita. If the blade is found to be damaged, the meat may not be eaten by Jews. If the blade falls or is lost before the second check is done, the first inspection is relied on and the meat is permitted.|$|E
500|$|As Tommy grows older, {{he discovers}} that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> {{vibrations}} sufficiently well {{to become an}} expert pinball player ("Pinball Wizard"). His parents take him to a respected doctor ("There's a Doctor"), who determines that the boy's disabilities are psychosomatic rather than physical. Tommy is told by the Doctor to [...] "Go to the Mirror!", and his parents notice he can stare at his reflection. After seeing Tommy spend extended periods staring at a mirror in the house, his mother smashes it out of frustration ("Smash the Mirror"). This removes Tommy's mental block, and he recovers his senses, realising he can become a powerful leader ("Sensation"). He starts a religious movement ("I'm Free"), which generates fervor among its adherents ("Sally Simpson") and expands into a holiday camp ("Welcome" [...] / [...] "Tommy's Holiday Camp"). However, Tommy's followers ultimately reject his teachings and leave the camp ("We're Not Gonna Take It"). Tommy retreats inward again ("See Me, Feel Me") with his [...] "continuing statement of wonder at that which encompasses him".|$|E

Once a person loses control of the timing, pitch, melody, etc. of his speech, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> also <b>feel</b> {{a sense of loss}} of personal identity, which can sometimes lead to depression.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{featured}} Mel Gibson {{as a guest}} voice. Scully {{had previously}} met him while writing jokes for a school fundraiser {{along with his wife}} Julie Thacker. Gibson and Daniel Stern were the hosts and needed jokes for the event. It turned out that Gibson was a fan of the show and watched it with his children. With that knowledge, it did not take Scully long to invite him to do a part. Gibson was willing to do the job and even came in on three separate occasions to do retakes – mostly because he knew his children would be watching. Unlike most guest voices, Gibson recorded the show along with the cast. On one occasion, it turned out that a joke written for Gibson actually did happen in real life. The writing staff wanted Gibson to say that he would urinate behind a dumpster, because it sounded like {{it would not be a}} classy thing to do for a movie star. He had, however, already done that during a couple of film premieres because <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> trapped in a public toilet with a lot of fans. Gibson was surprised the writers knew about the story, but it turned out to be a coincidence. Otherwise, the episode frequently references films Gibson appeared in. After the studio cart crashes, Gibson says to Homer, [...] "I'm getting too old for this crap," [...] a reference to a line said by Danny Glover's character Roger Murtaugh to Gibson's character Martin Riggs in the Lethal Weapon film series. A poster for his film Braveheart is on the wall in the editing room and the Road Warrior car from the 1981 film Mad Max 2 is also featured. In addition to Gibson, Jack Burns guest starred in the episode, voicing a film studio executive named Edward Christian. His frequent use of the terms [...] "Huh?" [...] and [...] "You know what I mean?" [...] is a reference to a comedy routine performed by Burns and Avery Schreiber. The episode also features John Travolta, in whose private jet Gibson flies to Springfield, but his voice was imitated by Dan Castellaneta.|$|E

60|$|The priests {{tried to}} show us, through a small screen, a {{fragment}} of the genuine Pillar of Flagellation, to which Christ was bound when they scourged him. But we could not see it, because it was dark inside the screen.

If man pretends to be able to fulfill our shortcomings, he or she will only create new shortcomings.

60|$|Let us remember, then, that {{whatsoever}} changes, {{still there}} is one who cannot change, Jesus Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and for ever.

It is pardonable, for it is human; and he has condescended to feel it himself, when he wept over Jerusalem.|$|E

60|$|Tennyson {{is a great}} poet, I think, and Browning, {{the author}} of 'Paracelsus,' has to my mind very noble capabilities. Do you know Mr. Horne's 'Orion,' the poem {{published}} for a farthing, to the wonder of booksellers and bookbuyers who could not understand 'the speculation in its eyes?' There are very fine things in this poem, and altogether I recommend it to your attention. But what is 'wanting' in Tennyson? He can think, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel,</b> and his language is highly expressive, characteristic, and harmonious. I am very fond of Tennyson. He makes me thrill sometimes {{to the end of}} my fingers, as only a true great poet can.|$|E

He protests against suspicions which he has not deserved. That he does sometimes think of Eunice he sees no reason to deny. He is conscious of errors and misdeeds, which--traceable {{as they are to}} Helena's irresistible fascinations--may perhaps be considered rather his misfortune than his fault. Be that as it may, he does indeed feel anxious to hear good accounts of Eunice's health. If this honest avowal excites her sister's jealousy, he will be disappointed in Helena for the first time.|$|E

It is not as you would repent; but you must remember that Arthur's is after all a boy's character; he has felt his errors as acutely as I think <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> them, and if he is turning from them, that is all we can justly expect.

6000|$|The episode {{illustrates}} the curious perversion of the English sense of honor when the privileges and {{prestige of the}} aristocracy are at stake. Mr. Frank Harris said, after the disastrous battle of Modder River, that the English, having lost America a century ago because they preferred George III, were quite prepared to lose South Africa to-day because they preferred aristocratic commanders to successful ones. Horace Walpole, when the parliamentary recess came at a critical period of the War of Independence, said that the Lords could {{not be expected to}} lose their pheasant shooting for the sake of America. In the working class, which, like all classes, has its own official aristocracy, there is the same reluctance to discredit an institution or to [...] "do a man out of his job." [...] At bottom, of course, this apparently shameless sacrifice of great public interests to petty personal ones, is simply the preference of the ordinary man for the things <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>feel</b> and understand to the things that are beyond his capacity. It is stupidity, not dishonesty.|$|E
