50|$|In the 1950s, as the Cold War raged on, Soviet {{strategic}} plans required that a secure transport link {{across the river}} Vistula be built. One {{of the ways to}} achieve this was to create a deep metro system in Warsaw (up to 150 ft beneath the ground), which would be interlinked with the rail network and could serve as an underground conduit for transporting troops. Plans assumed that the first line (about 11 km long) would lie along a North-South axis, with a branch of the same line crossing the Vistula river in the city <b>centre.</b> The <b>construction</b> <b>works</b> started almost simultaneously at 17 different points {{on both sides of the}} river. By 1953 only 771 m of tunnels had been built; after the death of Joseph Stalin and the start of a period of détente, all work was halted under the pretext of technical difficulties. In the following years, only one junction tunnel and one shield-driven tunnel were continued. These works were undertaken experimentally, in order to discover the best driving methods suitable for the ground conditions beneath Warsaw (pliocene clay formations layer spread beneath quaternary soils). Finally, in 1957, all work was halted.|$|R
