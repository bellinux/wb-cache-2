25|$|Single-shot {{firearms}} {{when used}} for hunting have some advantages over other rifles: they are cheap, {{they are usually}} more accurate, and their silent action does not scare game. On the other hand, their single-shot characteristic limit one's ability to make follow-up or repeated shots quickly, when the first round {{does not provide a}} clean kill or when multiples of game appear. Likewise, when hunting <b>dangerous</b> <b>game,</b> having only a single shot capability increases the danger for the hunter, and single-shot firearms are therefore rarely used for hunting <b>dangerous</b> <b>game.</b> Single-shot designs can be found in all classes of hunting firearms, including rifles, shotguns, and handguns.|$|E

In 1932 he starred with Fay Wray in The Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Game</b> - which used some of the same jungle sets built for King Kong as well as cast members Wray and Robert Armstrong.|$|E

25|$|New Mexico native Jacques De Bujac {{was signed}} by Selznick as a {{contract}} player, given the name Bruce Cabot, and met Cooper when auditioning for The Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Game.</b> He almost walked out of his Kong audition (mistakenly believing he was trying out as a stunt double for Joel McCrea) but was convinced otherwise and received the role of Jack Driscoll, his first starring role. He was an inexperienced actor and described his participation in Kong as standing in the right place, doing what he was told, and collecting a paycheck.|$|E
25|$|In May and June 1932, Cooper {{directed}} the first live-action Kong scenes on the jungle set built for The Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Game.</b> Some of these scenes {{were incorporated into}} the test reel later exhibited for the RKO board. The script was still in revision when the jungle scenes were shot {{and much of the}} dialogue was improvised. The jungle set was scheduled to be struck after Game was completed, so Cooper filmed all of the other jungle scenes at this time. The last scene shot was that of Driscoll and Ann racing through the jungle to safety following their escape from Kong's lair.|$|E
25|$|Cooper {{called in}} James Ashmore Creelman (who {{was working on}} the script of The Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Game</b> at the time) and the two men worked {{together}} on several drafts under the title The Eighth Wonder. Some details from Wallace's rough draft were dropped, notably his boatload of escaped convicts. Wallace's Danby Denham character, a big game hunter, became film director Carl Denham. His Shirley became Ann Darrow and her lover-convict John became Jack Driscoll. The 'beauty and the beast' angle was first developed at this time. Kong's escape was switched from Madison Square Garden to Yankee Stadium and (finally) to a Broadway theater. Cute moments involving the gorilla in Wallace's draft were cut because Cooper wanted Kong hard and tough in the belief that his fall would be all the more awesome and tragic.|$|E

25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a <b>dangerous</b> <b>game.</b> But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|Cooper {{took his}} concept to Paramount Studios {{in the first}} years of the Great Depression but {{executives}} shied away from a project that sent film crews on costly shoots to Africa and Komodo. In 1931, David O. Selznick brought Cooper to RKO as his executive assistant, and, to sweeten the deal, promised him he could make his own films. Cooper began immediately developing The Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Game,</b> a story about a big game hunter, and hired his friend and former film partner, Ernest B. Schoedsack, to direct. A huge jungle stage set was built, with Robert Armstrong and Fay Wray as the stars. Once the film was underway, Cooper turned his attention to the studio's big-budget-out-of-control fantasy, Creation, a story about a group of travelers shipwrecked on an island of dinosaurs. The film employed special effects wizard Willis O'Brien.|$|E
25|$|Motor Racing is a <b>dangerous</b> <b>game</b> {{and there}} had been some {{fatalities}} at Brands including the deaths of George Crossman, Tony Flory and Stuart Duncan in the mid-60s. But in October 1971, the season drew to its close with the death of a major driver. Jo Siffert died in an accident in the Rothmans World Championship Victory Race. This non-championship event for Formula One and Formula 5000 cars was arranged to mark Jackie Stewart and Ken Tyrrell's joint World Championships. The race was 40 laps in length; 'Seppi' lost control of his BRM P160 on lap 15, hit the bank at Hawthorn Hill, the car was engulfed in flames and he was asphyxiated before he could be extricated. The circuit came under a great deal of criticism, and it was agreed that a three-year programme of major safety modifications around the track would be commenced {{before the start of the}} 1972 season.|$|E

25|$|The action {{begins when}} a Yugoslav {{military}} attaché defects in Ottawa and is assassinated before the Canadians can interrogate him. In Trieste, {{at the same}} time, someone has begun eliminating NATO agents. Higgins, their case officer, is warned by Avadek {{that he has a}} traitor in his network. Suddenly, he's running for his life, framed for the murder of one of his contacts. Pursued by an unknown enemy, he falls in love with Fae, whose violent past figures in their search for answers. Meanwhile, Vitali Alferyev, KGB station chief in Belgrade, has been recalled to Moscow, where his superior orders him to withdraw all covert operatives from the sector between Rijeka and Ljubljana. Alferyev’s search for the reason leads him into a deadly conflict with a GRU agent operating in the area. The novel reaches its climax in the Yugoslav mountains, where Croatian terrorists, KGB spies, and NATO agents play out the final violent moves in a <b>dangerous</b> <b>game</b> to change the fate of Europe. Higgins and Avadek must sift through layers of deceit and treachery in their attempt to thwart an enemy whose tentacles stretch from the East to the West and from the past to the (novel’s) present.|$|E
25|$|Since {{the nuclear}} {{stalemate}} became apparent, the Governments of East and West {{have adopted the}} policy which Mr. Dulles calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, I am told, is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels {{on one side of}} the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as he passes, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly <b>dangerous</b> <b>game.</b> The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment is come, the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.|$|E

500|$|Since its release, {{the novel}} and its film {{adaptation}} have had an influence on later works. These include filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino, most notably his Kill Bill films; the character Gogo Yubari, played by Chiaki Kuriyama, {{is similar to the}} character she plays in the Battle Royale film, Takako Chigusa. V.A. Musetto of the New York Post also compared it to The Condemned, which the critic called [...] "a bad rip-off" [...] of Battle Royale as well as The Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Game.</b> Critics have also noted the influence of Battle Royale on other later works, such as the 2008 film Kill Theory, the 2009 film The Tournament, and the 2016 film The Belko Experiment, and have noted similarities with {{the novel and}} film franchise The Hunger Games. The manga, anime and film franchise Gantz and the 2007 video game The World Ends with You have both been compared to Battle Royale.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{continued}} her provocative imagery in the 1993 erotic thriller, Body of Evidence, a film which contained scenes of sadomasochism and bondage. It was poorly received by critics. She also {{starred in the}} film <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Game,</b> which was released straight to video in North America. The New York Times described the film as [...] "angry and painful, and the pain feels real." [...] In September 1993, Madonna embarked on The Girlie Show World Tour, in which she dressed as a whip-cracking dominatrix surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience. In March 1994, she appeared as a guest on the Late Show with David Letterman, using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it. The releases of her sexually explicit book, album and film, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that [...] "she had gone too far" [...] and that her career was over.|$|E
500|$|One month later, the San Francisco Chronicle {{receives}} encrypted letters {{written by}} the killer calling himself the [...] "Zodiac" [...] and taunting the police. Political cartoonist Robert Graysmith is not taken seriously by crime reporter Paul Avery or the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings despite {{his interest in the}} case. When the newspaper publishes the letters, a married couple is able to decipher one. At a local bar, Avery initially makes fun of Graysmith before they discuss the coded letters. Graysmith interprets the letter, which Avery finds helpful, and Avery begins sharing information. The Zodiac killer attacks law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard at Lake Berryessa in Napa County on September 27, 1969. Shepard dies two days later, and Hartnell survives. One of Graysmith's insights about the letters is that the Zodiac's reference to man as [...] "the most dangerous animal of them all" [...] is a reference to the story and film The Most <b>Dangerous</b> <b>Game</b> (which features General Zaroff as a man who hunts live human prey). The fact that both Zaroff's surname and the name [...] "Zodiac" [...] start with a [...] "Z" [...] also seems significant.|$|E
