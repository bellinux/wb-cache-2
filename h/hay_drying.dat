In this study PTR-MS flux measurements of VOC were performed over agricultural grassland during and after a cut event. Selected masses detected by the PTR-MS showed fluxes of methanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone. They were highest directly after cutting and during the <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> phase. Simultaneously, significant fluxes of protonated ion masses 73, 81, and 83 were observed. Due to the limited identification of compounds with the PTR-MS technique, GC-MS and GC-FID-PTR-MS techniques were additionally applied. In this way, ion mass 73 could be identified as 2 -buta-none, mass 81 mainly as (Z) - 3 -hexenal, and mass 83 mainly as the sum of (Z) - 3 -hexenol and hexenyl acetates.

Allocation at farm gate, between milk and meat, was made by biological relation between energy requirement to milk and meat production or economic allocation and at the dairy between cheese and whey using either economic allocation or system expansion. Inventory data was based on farm, herd and plant production data from commercial farms participation in on farm research activities with controlled production of hay, in combination with production information from cheese processing and literature estimates, all build into a static model. There was no effect of proportion of herbs in the hay on the emission of GHG, but an effect of breed. The emission per kg cheese was lowest from Jersey, 9. 88 kg CO 2 eq. per kg cheese, compared to 12. 1 and 12. 7 from two Holstein herds, although the emission per kg ECM at farm gate was highest from Jersey, but this was more than offset by higher utilization of Jersey milk for cheese. The emission from farm to retailor was below 10 % of the total emission, with the largest contribution from use of energy during manufacturing at the dairy, including storage. Methane with approximately 50 % of all emission was the major source, followed by emission associated to production of feed and rising of heifers. Use of energy for <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> adds 7 - 8 % to the emission and soil carbon change in average 3 %, with some variation between farms. The sensitivity analysis showed a potential 6 - 7 % lower emission of methane due to the increased amount of herbs, while a higher amount of roots due to herbs only has marginal effect on soil carbon at product level. Assuming the same feed conversion in Holstein as in Jersey reduced the different due to breed in emission per kg cheese, but still with a lower emission from Jersey, which illustrate the positive effect of Jersey milk composition on cheese production efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Two {{years of}} field drying data on unconditioned, {{mechanically}} conditioned, chemically conditioned and mechanical-cum-chemically conditioned hay {{were used to}} develop lucerne <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> models for predicting day-time moisture loss and overnight moisture uptake. Two types of moisture loss models were developed, one predicting the thin-layer drying constant ("k-model") and the other predicting drying rate directly ("DR-model"). The moisture uptake model predicted change in moisture content due to overnight dew. The "DR-model" provided a better prediction than the "k-model", reflected in R~ values of 0. 85 and 0. 65 respectively. The drying constant (k) and the drying rate (DR) were greatly influenced by solar radiation but use of potential evaporation as a lumped weather factor did not improve the prediction. Regression values indicated that rain and dew absorbed by the lucerne plant evaporated significantly faster than moisture from within the plant. The mechanical and chemical conditioning treatments resulted in higher values of k and DR, particularly during early stages of drying under favorable weather conditions. Overnight moisture content increase was largely influenced by the moisture content at sunset, but it decreased as vapor pressure deficit and swath/windrow density increased. Validation of the moisture loss and moisture uptake models revealed a satisfactory correlation between predicted and observed moisture contents...|$|E

The experimental design was randomized blocks in split plots with four replications and five levels of nitrogen (0, 25, 50, 75 and 100 kg ha- 1) in the form of urea, two regrowth ages (28 and 35 days) and <b>drying</b> <b>hay</b> in the sun and in shed. After harvesting, the grass was sampled four times (0, 8, 23 and 32 hours) to dry in the sun and twelve times (0, 3, 18, 27, 42, 51, 66, 75, 90, 99, 114 and 123 hours) for drying in shed, turned over daily. The fungi were identified after seeding and growth in three steps of haymaking (cutting, baling and after 30 days of storage). To verify the presence of mycotoxins, 20 samples, composed of hay stored for 30 days, were collected, of which 10 samples were from sun-dried hay and 10 from <b>hay</b> <b>dried</b> in shed. It took 32 hours to produce hay at field conditions, with water loss rates up to 6. 10 g g- 1 DM-h during the first 8 hours after cutting. The average loss of water in this period was 2. 0 g g- 1 DM-h. <b>Hays</b> <b>dried</b> in the shed took 123 hours and the dehydration rates were less than 0. 5 g g- 1 DM-h due to environmental conditions. There was a predominance of three genera of fungi: Fusarium, Penicillium and Aspergillus. The largest population was the Fusarium, followed by Penicillium, at the steps of baling and storage.

40|$|Milk {{coming from}} hay feed cows {{are being used}} to produce a range of artisanal cheeses in Europe. Hay-milk {{contains}} low number of anaerobic Clostridium spores that can be detrimental to cheeses late in the ripening period. The forage composition has in the literature been correlated with elevated contents of plant derived aroma compounds (terpenes) in cheese. Hard cheese was made using milk from three Danish dairy-farms (A, B and C) where the cows had been feed with three different types of hay (Feed 1, 2 and 3) made from forage containing varying amount of herbs. The cheese was produced over three production periods (I, II and III) with all combinations of dairy-farmer and hay-type. A control cheese was made in all three production periods using normal bulk milk, where the cows were feed primarily with silage. No differences were seen in the content of plant derived aroma compounds in the experimental milk compared to the control milk. The cheeses had similar moisture content and pH development throughout the 12 months ripening period and no differences was seen in the number of starter and non-starter organisms. The control cheeses contained significantly higher cell numbers of Lactobacillus casei within the first 4 weeks of ripening as compared to the experimental cheese. There was a strong correlation between production period and the content of aroma content in the cheeses, but no differences in the aroma content could be related to the type of feed or dairy-farm. High quality cheese could be made without addition of nitrate to inhibit anaerobic spores, from cows feed with hay containing Danish herbs. The experimental milk and cheeses did not contain higher amounts of plant derived aroma compounds; and this could be due a loss of leave material seen during the <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> step...|$|E
40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1986 Dr. Madan Lal GuptaIn southern Australia, fodder is conserved mainly as hay, and pasture is the common raw material. This hay-making process is complex and, unlike other harvesting operations which are virtually instantaneous, involves a series of sequential operations with three or more different machines. It also involves {{a number of major}} and minor management decisions in a highly variable weather regime and with continuously changing crop conditions. A simulation model has been developed to evaluate alternative hay-making systems and management policies in terms of the digestible dry matter (DDM) yield of hay and of the harvesting time. The main simulation is based on a series of sub-models associated with pasture growth, weather forecasts, management, hay-drying and hay losses. Some of these models are based on the available literature and others have been developed by the author. Field-drying experiments with unconditioned and conditioned pasture were conducted to develop the <b>hay</b> <b>drying</b> model which also includes the effect of dew and rain. A method was developed to make an assessment of three-day weather forecasts for scheduling hay-making operations. Simulation experiments were carried out by using 16 years of historical weather data from Laverton, Victoria. Management factors such as weather prospects after cutting, maximum cut crop allowed in the swath and maturity at the start of season were found to affect the DDM yield and harvesting time. To achieve a significant increase in DDM yield of hay, either an improvement in the accuracy of weather forecasting is necessary or the drying time in the field must be reduced by applying a treatment such as conditioning of the crop at the time of cutting. The major limitation of the present simulation model is the lack of data. Research is needed to refine the loss parameters due to environmental factors and mechanical operations on which the DDM yield is based. A number of other promising research areas also are outlined to extend the use of the present model and make improvements to it. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{this study}} was to assess the {{dehydration}} curve and nutritional value of Tifton 85 bermudagrass at two cutting heights from ground level (4 and 8 cm) during 120 days of storage in a closed shed. The dehydration curve was determined using samples from the entire plant at eight different times. The experimental design consisted of randomized blocks with plots subdivided per times and five replicates. The second step consisted of assessing the nutritional value of the stored Tifton 85 bermudagrass in randomized blocks with plots subdivided per times and two treatments per plot: cutting height of four and eight centimeters from the ground, and five different times for the subplots, with five replicates. Dehydration of Tifton 85 bermudagrass at the two heights occurred in 48 hours, considered an ideal time for <b>hay</b> <b>drying.</b> The dry matter content responded quadratically to the time of storage of the two heights, only differing during baling and after 120 days of storage. Crude protein content had a quadratic behavior in the two cutting heights, with the smallest value after 30 days of storage (107. 0 g kg- 1) and the largest after 90 days (147. 8 g kg- 1) in the cutting height of eight centimeters. The ether extract exhibited a quadratic behavior in the two cutting heights, only differing after 90 days of storage. The neutral detergent fiber content had linear positive response according to the time of storage, with no difference between the cutting heights. For the neutral detergent fiber content in the two cutting heights, the quadratic regression model was the best fit to the data, differing between the heights after 30 and 60 days of storage. In vitro dry matter digestibility and in vitro cell wall digestibility values of the stored hay were lower than the values obtained at the time of cutting. Cutting performed at four centimeters from the ground was the most suitable for hay production due to higher dry matter production and nutritional value without difference between bailing treatments.
