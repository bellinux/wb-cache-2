5|$|Beechwood Theater, {{a replica}} of the Little Theater on Broadway, was {{included}} in Wells Bosworth's design of the primary school building because Vanderlip particularly wanted his own theater. Beechwood Theater, with 256 gold velvet seats, was designed by Winthrop Ames around 1917. Details were closely examined upon construction; the lighting equipment, the scene lofts and <b>fly</b> <b>gallery,</b> and the dressing rooms were well-designed and state-of-the-art. The stage floor was designed especially for dancing, and the acoustics and theater proportions made varieties of productions possible.|$|E
500|$|In Arlington County, a burst pipe flooded two {{corridors}} at the Pentagon. Employees, {{many of whom}} {{left the}} building when the earthquake was felt, were alerted to the flooding by an alarm system that was installed after the September 11 attacks. Arlington House, The Robert E. Lee Memorial, in Arlington National Cemetery experienced [...] significant damage when the quake shifted the structure’s back wall by {{a quarter of an}} inch, producing large cracks in the plaster and requiring the closure of the House's back hallway and second floor. The County's Thomas Jefferson Theater—home to a middle school auditorium and several community theatre groups—closed for several months due to damage to its stage area, including a shift of the masonry bearing walls and supports for its <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> and gridiron deck. [...] The nearby City of Alexandria experienced damage to chimneys and/or other brickwork in Gadsby's Tavern, the Alexandria City Hall and other historic buildings.|$|E
2500|$|The Georgian Theatre is a {{professional}} performing arts facility located in Barrie’s north end {{on the campus of}} Georgian College. [...] The theatre features a proscenium stage, sound, lights, <b>fly</b> <b>gallery,</b> and seating for 427 on the main level with 3 pods which can be used to increase the seating capacity to 690. The Theatre is used for both theatrical and non-theatrical activity including conferences and seminars.|$|E
50|$|The stage {{itself was}} {{equipped}} with the most modern stage machinery then in use. The deck of the stage had double-floors. Four spiral staircases surrounded the stage leading to four <b>fly</b> <b>galleries.</b> Scenery was raised and lowered by hydraulic rams under the stage.|$|R
50|$|The Theatre boasts {{an ample}} {{orchestra}} pit, <b>fly</b> <b>galleries</b> with winchable lighting bars and versatile hemp bars, a large control room, an FOH sound location, two large dressing rooms, and a sliding scenery dock {{door at the}} rear of the stage (currently disused). The theatre is well equipped for a student theatre.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> is a catwalk {{running from}} the {{proscenium}} wall to upstage wall to which a pinrail and/or locking rail may be mounted used by the fly crew to operate the fly system. The <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> elevation is typically at about proscenium height, providing {{a good view of}} the stage and fly loft. Fly galleries may be provided stage left and right, or at just one side. Where provided at both sides of the stage they may be connected by a cross-over catwalk at the upstage wall. It is possible to load arbors (add or remove counterweights) at the <b>fly</b> <b>gallery,</b> but standard practice is to load arbors at the loading bridge. (A vertical cinematic montage from the deck to the <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> is a striking feature of Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{backstage}} {{areas were}} unusually large. Dressing rooms were on five levels, and an elevator {{was available to}} transport actors down to the stage level. A <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> (where scenery was hung) was also uncommonly large.|$|E
50|$|A locking rail is {{typically}} a steel angle or rectangular tube {{to which the}} rope locks of a counterweight system are mounted. Locking rails are located on the stage deck and/or <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> and typically extend from the proscenium wall to the upstage wall.|$|E
500|$|Wyatt testified he saw [...] "Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Clanton {{standing}} in a row against {{the east side of}} the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of <b>Fly's</b> photograph <b>gallery.</b> Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don't know [...] were {{standing in}} the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west." [...] Addie Bourland corroborated Wyatt's testimony, stating that she saw [...] "five men opposite my house, leaning against a small house west of <b>Fly's</b> <b>Gallery</b> and one man was holding a horse, standing a little out from the house." ...|$|R

50|$|The main {{auditorium}} could seat up to 1400 people, {{it consisted of}} pit stalls with 300 seats, dress and rear circles with another 300 seats, then a gallery and amphi with 800 seats. The theatre also offered {{one of the largest}} stages in the area with a <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> offering fast scenery changes.|$|E
5000|$|The theatre has {{a number}} of {{facilities}} available to users including installation throughout of Ethernet and DMX, a Service Loop and a large scaffold tower.

50|$|In Tombstone they {{immediately}} opened a photography studio in a tent. In July, 1880, they completed construction on a 12-room boarding house at 312 Fremont Street in Tombstone that housed their photography studio and gallery in the back, called the “Fly Gallery”. Mollie Fly actively managed <b>Fly's</b> <b>Gallery</b> {{when her husband}} was away. She {{was one of the}} few female photographers of the era, taking pictures of anyone who could pay the studio price of 35 cents. It's unknown how they divided photographic duties between them, although all known photographs are attributed to him.|$|R

5000|$|An {{exception}} to his stage activities was film. In 1931 {{he wrote and}} appeared in the MGM short Ambitious People. In an interview that same year he was quoted saying of a new playwright: [...] "He knows nothing about dialogue or building up a situation. He doesn't know upstage from downstage or a border light from a <b>fly</b> <b>gallery.</b> But he knows all the dirty stories in the world." ...|$|E

5000|$|The theatre was {{comparable}} to the best opera and vaudeville houses {{in the country at}} the turn of the century when it was constructed. [...] The stage measures 34 ft deep and 60 ft wide. The gilded proscenium arch is 26 ft wide. The gridiron is 70 ft above the stage while the two <b>fly</b> <b>galleries</b> are almost 30 ft about the stage. In addition, there is a paint gallery that is 34 ft above the stage floor. This enables artists to paint scenery cloths while viewing them vertically. The theatre was proclaimed [...] "acoustically perfect" [...] when it was built.|$|R
50|$|He {{played the}} part of an artist and {{painting}} tutor in Joanna Hogg's film Archipelago, shot on Tresco, Isles of Scilly in 2009. It was shown at the 2010 London Film Festival. and is released in the UK on 4 March 2011.

5000|$|Mary Edith [...] "Mollie" [...] Fly (1847-1925) was a late 19th {{and early}} 20th century American {{photographer}} who co-founded and managed <b>Fly's</b> Photography <b>Gallery</b> in Tombstone, Arizona, with her husband, photographer C. S. Fly. She ran the studio solo {{for a decade}} after his death. There were very few women photographers in this period, and her contributions were recognized in 1989 when she {{was inducted into the}} Arizona Women's Hall of Fame.|$|R
50|$|A triodetic dome was {{constructed}} over the theatre in 1970. Further renovations were completed in 1975, {{which resulted in}} a modernized facility but a reduction of 600 seats. The renovations involved a labour dispute and a temporary move to the Manitoba Centennial Concert Hall. In 1986, a <b>fly</b> <b>gallery,</b> carpentry and paint shops, classrooms and expanded change rooms were added to the facility. The 1986 renovation involved replacing an original timber arch. A commemorative plaque and a replica of the arch were erected {{in front of the building}} in 1988.|$|E
50|$|Actor Errol Flynn made early {{appearances}} on the Royal's stage before embarking on his film career. For {{several months in}} 1933, {{he was part of}} the Northampton Repertory Players at the Royal. In January 1977, scenes for the Doctor Who serial The Talons of Weng-Chiang were shot inside the theatre. The serial was set in Victorian London and an authentic atmosphere was wanted for the theatre scenes. According to director David Maloney on the DVD commentary, it was chosen because it had the nearest original <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> to London.|$|E
50|$|Specific to a {{stage house}} using a {{counterweight}} system, the loading bridge, or loading gallery, is a catwalk vertically positioned below the headlock beam, {{and above the}} <b>fly</b> <b>gallery.</b> The loading bridge is used to add or remove counterweights from arbors. The floor of the loading bridge is also typically used as a storage area for uncommitted counterweights that are available for loading onto counterweight arbors. Stage houses with especially tall fly towers, or double-purchase systems, may have two loading bridges, one stacked over the other to facilitate the loading of relatively tall arbors.|$|E
5000|$|Wyatt testified {{afterward}} {{that he saw}} [...] "Frank McLaury, Tom McLaury, and Billy Clanton {{standing in}} a row against {{the east side of}} the building on the opposite side of the vacant space west of <b>Fly's</b> photograph <b>gallery.</b> Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne and a man I don't know Wes Fuller were standing in the vacant space about halfway between the photograph gallery and the next building west." [...] Wes Fuller was towards the back of the lot.|$|R

50|$|The Flys {{moved to}} the boom town of Tombstone in Arizona Territory in 1879 {{and set up a}} {{photographic}} studio. Initially it was housed in a tent, but by mid 1880 they had built a 12-room boarding house at 312 Fremont St., with their <b>Fly's</b> Photography <b>Gallery</b> housed in the back part of the premises. In 1881, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral took place in a lot next to the boarding house, and Ike Clanton escaped through the boarding house during the fight.|$|R
50|$|A Fly Captain, Fly Man (US & Canda) or Fly Chief, in the UK, is {{in charge}} of the flymen who operate a fly system in a {{theatrical}} production. Ordinarily a fly man will coordinate with the set designer to get flying scenery safely into the fly loft (or <b>fly</b> <b>gallery)</b> and to plan and delegate flyrail cues. The fly man can also be a stage manager in a small theater. The flyman is usually responsible for all matters of safety involving the fly system and also for making sure rail cues are executed quickly and properly. The fly man supervises the loading and unloading of counterweights in a fly system.|$|E
5000|$|The three-story building’s {{auditorium}} was 75 ft deep by 48.5 ft wide, with a {{seating capacity}} of 727: boxes 88, parquet 344, dress circle 172, balcony 123. Thomas Edison {{is reported to}} have personally worked on making it the first theatre lit entirely by electricity (not the first to use electric lights), and Louis Comfort Tiffany designed aspects of the interior. Not all new technologies lasted: for the first season the orchestra rode an [...] "automatic elevator car" [...] into the <b>fly</b> <b>gallery</b> to play in a gallery over the proscenium during performances, but the car was removed in the theatre’s second year. Ticket prices initially ranged from $1 to $2.50.|$|E
50|$|In a {{conventional}} counterweight system the operating and lift lines terminate {{at the top}} of the arbor after passing over the head block. In a double-purchase system, however, after passing over the head block the operating and lift lines pass through another block, which is mounted to the top of the arbor, before rising back up and terminating below the head block. In addition, the opposite end of a double-purchase operating line terminates at the <b>fly</b> <b>gallery,</b> off-stage wall, or stage deck, instead of the underside of the arbor, after passing through a block mounted at the underside of the arbor. The additional blocks result in the arbor moving at half the rate of the lift and operating lines.|$|E
50|$|Ms. Norwood is {{an animal}} savior, a singer, and a visual artist. She {{performed}} with the Huntsville Opera Theater for several years until its dissolution. The <b>Flying</b> Monkey Arts <b>Gallery</b> in Huntsville, Alabama, is home to several of her current interests in art, both static and performance.|$|R
60|$|She {{sprung from}} him and {{disappeared}} through the door by which she had made her second appearance; and, at the same instant, a pair of large folding-doors at {{the upper end of}} the <b>gallery</b> <b>flew</b> open with vehemence, and six or seven young gentlemen, richly dressed, pressed forward into the apartment, having, for the greater part, their swords drawn.|$|R
50|$|The Circa Timeline section {{features}} motorcycles manufactured {{prior to}} 1930 including a De Dion-Bouton trike, Thomas, Reading Standard, Yale, Pope, Thor, Henderson, and <b>Flying</b> Merkel.
