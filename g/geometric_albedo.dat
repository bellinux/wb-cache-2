5|$|All of Neptune's inner moons {{are dark}} objects: their <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo</b> ranges from 7 to 10%. Their spectra {{indicate}} that they are made from water ice contaminated by some very dark material, probably complex organic compounds.

5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of Uranus, which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (the smallest of the five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo</b> in visible light of approximately 0.11.|$|E
5|$|Only two {{of these}} bodies, Ceres and Pluto, have been {{observed}} in enough detail to demonstrate that they actually fit the IAU's definition. The IAU accepted Eris as a dwarf planet {{because it is more}} massive than Pluto. They subsequently decided that unnamed trans-Neptunian objects with an absolute magnitude brighter than +1 (and hence a diameter of ≥838km assuming a <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo</b> of ≤1) are to be named under the assumption that they are dwarf planets.|$|E
30|$|One should {{consider}} bolometric Bond <b>albedos</b> rather than <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> in global energy-budget calculations. This is because Bond albedos are spherical, while <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> are directional. Studies oftentimes only report <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> of celestial objects, since these are directly measurable, while Bond albedos must be calculated and require {{knowledge of the}} hemispheric phase integral. Airless bodies usually have Bond albedos that are lower than their <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos.</b>|$|R

50|$|Fortuna is 225 km in {{diameter}} and {{has one of the}} darkest known <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> for an asteroid over 150 km {{in diameter}}. Its albedo has been measured at 0.028 and 0.037.|$|R
5|$|The {{rings are}} made of an {{extremely}} dark material. The <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo</b> of the ring particles does not exceed 5–6%, while the Bond albedo is even lower—about 2%. The rings particles demonstrate a steep opposition surge—an increase of the albedo when the phase angle is close to zero. This means that their albedo is much lower when they are observed slightly off the opposition. The rings are slightly red in the ultraviolet and visible parts of the spectrum and grey in near-infrared. They exhibit no identifiable spectral features. The chemical composition of the ring particles is not known. However, they cannot be made of pure water ice like the rings of Saturn because they are too dark, darker than the inner moons of Uranus. This indicates that they are probably composed of a mixture of the ice and a dark material. The nature of this material is not clear, {{but it may be}} organic compounds considerably darkened by the charged particle irradiation from the Uranian magnetosphere. The rings' particles may consist of a heavily processed material which was initially {{similar to that of the}} inner moons.|$|E
5|$|Umbriel's {{surface is}} the darkest of the Uranian moons, and {{reflects}} {{less than half}} as much light as Ariel, a sister satellite of similar size. Umbriel has a very low Bond albedo of only about 10% as compared to 23% for Ariel. The reflectivity of the moon's surface decreases from 26% at a phase angle of 0° (<b>geometric</b> <b>albedo)</b> to 19% at an angle of about 1°. This phenomenon is called opposition surge. The surface of Umbriel is slightly blue in color, while fresh bright impact deposits (in Wunda crater, for instance) are even bluer. There may be an asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres; the former appears to be redder than the latter. The reddening of the surfaces probably results from space weathering from bombardment by charged particles and micrometeorites {{over the age of}} the Solar System. However, the color asymmetry of Umbriel is likely caused by accretion of a reddish material coming from outer parts of the Uranian system, possibly, from irregular satellites, which would occur predominately on the leading hemisphere. The surface of Umbriel is relatively homogeneous—it does not demonstrate strong variation in either albedo or color.|$|E
25|$|Two common albedos {{that are}} used in {{astronomy}} are the (V-band) <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo</b> (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the Bond albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.|$|E

40|$|Exoplanet {{research}} {{focusing on}} the characterization of super-Earths is currently limited to those handful targets orbiting bright stars that are amenable to detailed study. This Letter proposes to look at alternative avenues to probe the surface and atmospheric properties of this category of planets, known to be ubiquitous in our galaxy. I conduct Markov Chain Monte Carlo lightcurve analyses for 97 Kepler close-in R_P ≲ 2. 0 R_⊕ super-Earth candidates with the aim to detect their occultations at visible wavelengths. Brightness temperatures and <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> in the Kepler bandpass are constrained for 27 super-Earth candidates. A hierarchical Bayesian modeling approach is then employed to characterize the population-level reflective properties of these close-in super-Earths. I find median <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> A_g in the Kepler bandpass ranging between 0. 16 and 0. 30, once decontaminated from thermal emission. These super-Earths <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> are statistically larger than for hot Jupiters, which have medians A_g ranging between 0. 06 and 0. 11. A subset of objects, including Kepler- 10 b, exhibit significantly larger albedos (A_g≳ 0. 4). I argue that {{a better understanding of}} the incidence of stellar irradiation on planetary surface and atmospheric processes is key to explain the diversity in albedos observed for close-in super-Earths.

All have well-developed negative branches, suggestive of relatively dark, texturally complex surfaces - possibly regoliths. <b>Geometric</b> <b>albedos,</b> estimated from the positive branch of the polarization curves, show that a significant dispersion in surface albedo exists within the asteroid belt...|$|R
500|$|Venusian {{clouds are}} thick and are {{composed}} mainly (75-96%) of sulfuric acid droplets. [...] These clouds obscure {{the surface of}} Venus from optical imaging, and reflect about 75% of the sunlight that falls on them. The <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo,</b> a common measure of reflectivity, is the highest of any planet in the Solar System. This high reflectivity potentially enables any probe exploring the cloud tops sufficient solar energy such that solar cells can be fitted anywhere on the craft. The density of the clouds is highly variable with the densest layer at about 48.5km, reaching 0.1 g/m3 similar to the lower range of cumulonimbus storm clouds on Earth.|$|E
500|$|Observations by the {{orbiting}} Microvariability and Oscillations of STars telescope initially {{limited the}} planet's albedo (or reflectivity) below 0.3, {{making it a}} surprisingly dark object. (The <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo</b> has since been measured to be 0.038 ± 0.045.) In comparison, Jupiter has a much higher albedo of 0.52. This would suggest that HD 209458 b's upper cloud deck is either made of less reflective material than is Jupiter's, or else has no clouds and Rayleigh-scatters incoming radiation like Earth's dark ocean. Models since then have shown that between {{the top of its}} atmosphere and the hot, high pressure gas surrounding the mantle, there exists a stratosphere of cooler gas. [...] This implies an outer shell of dark, opaque, hot cloud; usually thought to consist of vanadium and titanium oxides like red dwarfs ("pM planets"), but other compounds like tholins cannot be ruled out yet. The Rayleigh-scattering heated hydrogen rests {{at the top of the}} stratosphere; the absorptive portion of the cloud deck floats above it at 25 millibars.|$|E
500|$|Voyager 2 was {{the first}} {{spacecraft}} to observe Enceladus's surface in detail, in August 1981. Examination of the resulting highest-resolution imagery revealed at least five different types of terrain, including several regions of cratered terrain, regions of smooth (young) terrain, and lanes of ridged terrain often bordering the smooth areas. In addition, extensive linear cracks and scarps were observed. Given the relative lack of craters on the smooth plains, these regions are probably less than a few hundred million years old. Accordingly, Enceladus must have been recently active with [...] "water volcanism" [...] or other processes that renew the surface. The fresh, clean ice that dominates its surface gives Enceladus the most reflective surface of any body in the Solar System, with a visual <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo</b> of 1.38 and bolometric Bond albedo of [...] Because it reflects so much sunlight, its surface only reaches a mean noon temperature of , somewhat colder than other Saturnian satellites.|$|E

40|$|Diameters and <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> {{are derived}} from 10 - and 20 -micron {{infrared}} photometry for 84 asteroids, 68 of them not previously observed in this program of asteroid radiometry. All but three of the 30 brightest asteroids {{are included in the}} total sample of 131 objects, and all asteroids with diameters greater than 250 km can now be identified. The albedos are strongly bimodal, with the great majority of asteroids (class C) having visual <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> between 0. 025 and 0. 050. The albedos of the second most numerous class, the S asteroids, are primarily between 0. 10 and 0. 16. The third largest class appears to be the M objects, of which seven are now identified. Apparently, the M objects are very rare for semimajor axes of less than 2. 4 AU. The unusual asteroids with albedos greater than 0. 20 are also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Results are {{reported}} for radiometric measurements of broadband 20 -micron fluxes from the Trojan asteroids 617 Patroclus, 624 Hektor (for which the broadband 10 -micron flux was also measured), 1172 Aeneas, and 1173 Anchises {{as well as}} from the outer Jovian satellites Himalia (J 6) and Elara (J 7). <b>Geometric</b> <b>albedos</b> and radii for the six objects are derived from the corrected monochromatic fluxes and visual magnitudes. It is found that all the objects have exceedingly low <b>geometric</b> <b>albedos,</b> indicating that the Trojans and possibly the outer Jovian satellites constitute a distinct class of small solar-system bodies. The composition of the Trojan asteroids is considered on the basis of available sizes, albedos, and shapes. Revised tables of the albedos and radii of all the Jovian satellites are presented. It is concluded that the Trojans are not composed primarily of ice and that an asteroidal origin for the comets of the Jupiter group is unlikely...|$|R
500|$|Triton {{follows a}} {{retrograde}} and quasi-circular orbit, and {{is thought to}} be a gravitationally captured satellite. It was the second moon in the Solar System that was discovered to have a substantial atmosphere, which is primarily nitrogen with small amounts of methane and carbon monoxide. The pressure on Triton's surface is about 14μbar. In 1989 the Voyager 2 spacecraft observed what appeared to be clouds and hazes in this thin atmosphere. Triton is one of the coldest bodies in the Solar System, with a surface temperature of about [...] Its surface is covered by nitrogen, methane, carbon dioxide and water ices and has a high <b>geometric</b> <b>albedo</b> of more than 70%. The Bond albedo is even higher, reaching up to 90%. Surface features include the large southern polar cap, older cratered planes cross-cut by graben and scarps, as well as youthful features probably formed by endogenic processes like cryovolcanism. Voyager 2 observations revealed a number of active geysers within the polar cap heated by the Sun, which eject plumes to the height of up to 8km. Triton has a relatively high density of about 2g/cm3 indicating that rocks constitute about two thirds of its mass, and ices (mainly water ice) the remaining one third. There may be a layer of liquid water deep inside Triton, forming a subterranean ocean. Because of its retrograde orbit and relative proximity to Neptune (closer than the Moon is to Earth), tidal deceleration is causing Triton to spiral inward, which will lead to its destruction in about 3.6 billion years.|$|E
