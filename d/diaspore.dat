In Northern Ireland they once provided a major source of iron and aluminium ores. Laterite ores also were the early major source of nickel.|$|E

The horizontal or vertical seed often has a thickened or woody seed coat. The green or white embryo is either spirally (and without perisperm) or annular (rarely straight).|$|E

40|$|URL] The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the germination and the storage capacity of Astronium fraxinifolium <b>diaspores.</b> Six pre-germination treatments were used in the experiment: control treatment (intact diaspores); <b>diaspores</b> immersed in water at room temperature (25 º C) for 5 min; <b>diaspores</b> immersed in water at 70 ° C for 5 min; <b>diaspores</b> immersed in water at 100 ° C for 5 min; <b>diaspores</b> immersed in sodium hypochlorite solution (1 : 1000) for 2 min; and <b>diaspores</b> mechanically scarified with sandpaper # 80. To evaluate storage conditions, we tested two different types of packaging (permeable paper bag and transparent glass jar) and two environmental conditions (cold chamber and room conditions), resulting in four treatments. The germination tests were performed for zero (control) and 60, 120, 180, 240, 300 and 360 days after storage. The effects of different treatments on germination and storage of <b>diaspores</b> were evaluated by ANOVA, followed by Tukey test. Regarding to pre-germination treatments, high germination rates were observed in the hypochlorite (98. 0 ± 4. 22 %), control (97. 0 ± 4. 83 %), water at room temperature (96. 0 ± 6. 99 %) and water at 70 º C (83. 0 ± 29. 08 %) treatments. Thus, Astronium fraxinifolium <b>diaspores</b> do not present dormancy. During storage, the <b>diaspores</b> remained viable throughout the study period with high germination rates, except for the treatment in paper bags placed in the cold chamber, in which the <b>diaspores</b> lost their viability in the eighth month of storage. Therefore, this is not a recommended storage method for this species. </p...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} sophistication of paleoethnobotanical methods, {{it is now}} possible to reconstruct new aspects of the day-to-day life of past peoples, and, ultimately, gain information about their cultivated plants, land-use practices, architecture, diet, and trade. Reliable identification of plant remains, however, remains essential to the study of paleoethnobotany, and there is still much to learn about precise identification. This paper describes and evaluates the most frequent types of deformed desiccated <b>diaspores</b> revealed from adobe bricks used in buildings in Southwestern Hungary that were built primarily between 1850 and 1950. A total of 24, 634 <b>diaspores</b> were recovered from 333. 05 kg adobe samples. These seeds and fruits belong to 303 taxa, and the majority were arable and ruderal weed species. A total of 98. 97 % of the <b>diaspores</b> were identified to species. In other cases, identification was possible only to genus or family (0. 93 % and 0. 10 % of <b>diaspores,</b> respectively). Difficulties in identification were caused mainly by morphological changes in the size, shape, color, and surface features of <b>diaspores.</b> Most <b>diaspores</b> were darker in color and significantly smaller than fresh or recently desiccated seeds and fruits. Surface features were often absent or fragmented. The most problematic seeds to identify were those of Centaurea cyanus, Consolida regalis, Scleranthus annuus and Daucus carota ssp. carota, which are discussed in detail. Our research aids archaeobotanists in the identification of desiccated and deformed <b>diaspores.</b> </p...|$|R

2500|$|Bauxite ore is {{the main}} source for aluminium. Bauxite is a variety of {{laterite}} (residual sedimentary rock), so it has no precise chemical formula. It is composed mainly of hydrated alumina minerals such as gibbsite [...] in newer tropical deposits; in older subtropical, temperate deposits the major minerals are boehmite [...] and some <b>diaspore</b> [...] The average chemical composition of bauxite, by weight, is 45 to 60% Al2O3 and 20 to 30% Fe2O3. The remaining weight consists of silicas (quartz, chalcedony and kaolinite), carbonates (calcite, magnesite and dolomite), titanium dioxide and water. Bauxites of economical interest must be low in kaolinite. Formation of lateritic bauxites occurs worldwide in the 145- to 2-million-year-old Cretaceous and Tertiary coastal plains. The bauxites form elongate belts, sometimes hundreds of kilometers long, parallel to Lower Tertiary shorelines in India and South America; their distribution {{is not related to}} a particular mineralogical composition of the parent rock. Many high-level bauxites are formed in coastal plains which were subsequently uplifted to their present altitude.|$|E

In soil samples taken from following layers:   0 – 10, 10 – 20, 20 – 30 cm of soil under ploughing, ploughless or direct drilling tillage systems, species composition and number of weed <b>diaspores</b> were evaluated. In the samples, in total there were <b>diaspores</b> of 17 weed species. Chenopodium album was the dominant weed species in all soil layers and tillage systems. The number of <b>diaspores</b> was significantly dependent on tillage system and soil layer. Irrespective of soil depth, the highest total number of <b>diaspores</b> (12251 pcs × m - 2) was in the treatment with the ploughing tillage system, while for the other treatments this number was significantly lower: by 14 % for ploughless tillage and by 51 % for the direct drilling treatment. Regardless of soil tillage system, the highest total number of <b>diaspores</b> (19936 pcs × m - 2) was in the top layer, while in the next layers this number was significantly lower (by 62 and 87 %, respectively).

2500|$|Oxide {{minerals}} {{are divided}} into three categories: simple oxides, hydroxides, and multiple oxides. Simple oxides are characterized by O2− as the main anion and primarily ionic bonding. They can be further subdivided by the ratio of oxygen to the cations. The periclase group consists of minerals with a 1:1 ratio. Oxides with a 2:1 ratio include cuprite (Cu2O) and water ice. Corundum group minerals have a 2:3 ratio, and includes minerals such as corundum (Al2O3), and hematite (Fe2O3). Rutile group minerals have a ratio of 1:2; the eponymous species, rutile (TiO2) is the chief ore of titanium; other examples include cassiterite (SnO2; ore of tin), and pyrolusite (MnO2; ore of manganese). [...] In hydroxides, the dominant anion is the hydroxyl ion, OH−. Bauxites are the chief aluminium ore, and are a heterogeneous mixture of the hydroxide minerals <b>diaspore,</b> gibbsite, and bohmite; they form in areas with a very high rate of chemical weathering (mainly tropical conditions). [...] Finally, multiple oxides are compounds of two metals with oxygen. A major group within this class are the spinels, with a general formula of X2+Y3+2O4. Examples of species include spinel (MgAl2O4), chromite (FeCr2O4), and magnetite (Fe3O4). The latter is readily distinguishable by its strong magnetism, which occurs as it has iron in two oxidation states (Fe2+Fe3+2O4), {{which makes it a}} multiple oxide instead of a single oxide.|$|E

50|$|In botany, a <b>diaspore</b> is a plant {{dispersal}} unit {{consisting of}} a seed or spore plus any additional tissues that assist dispersal.

In a few seed plants, the <b>diaspore</b> is {{most or all of}} the plant, and is known as a tumbleweed.|$|E
40|$|Both {{rewards and}} signals are {{important}} in mutualisms. In myrmecochory, or seed dispersal by ants, the benefits to plants are relatively well studied, but less is known about why ants pick up and move seeds. We examined seed dispersal by the ant Aphaenogaster rudis of four co-occurring species of plants, and tested whether morphology, chemical signaling, or the nutritional quality of fatty seed appendages called elaiosomes influenced dispersal rates. In removal trials, ants quickly collected <b>diaspores</b> (seeds plus elaiosomes) of Asarum canadense, Trillium grandiflorum, and Sanguinaria canadensis, but largely neglected those of T. erectum. This discrepancy was not explained by differences in the bulk cost-benefit ratio, as assessed by the ratio of seed to elaiosome mass. We also provisioned colonies with <b>diaspores</b> from one of these four plant species or no <b>diaspores</b> as a control. Colonies performed best when fed S. canadensis <b>diaspores,</b> worst when fed T. grandiflorum, and intermediately when fed A. canadense, T. erectum, or no <b>diaspores.</b> Thus, the nutritional rewards in elaiosomes affected colony performance, but did not completely predict seed removal. Instead, high levels of oleic acid in T. grandiflorum elaiosomes may explain why ants disperse these <b>diaspores</b> even though they reduce ant colony performance. We show {{for the first time}} that different elaiosome-bearing plants provide rewards of different quality to ant colonies, but also that ants appear unable to accurately assess reward quality when encountering seeds. Instead, we suggest that signals can trump rewards as attractants of ants to seeds...|$|R

40|$|Correlations between transequatorial {{migratory bird}} routes and bipolar biogeographic disjunctions in bryophytes suggest that disjunctions between {{northern}} and southern high latitude regions may result from bird-mediated dispersal; supporting evidence is, however, exclusively circumstantial. Birds disperse plant units (<b>diaspores)</b> internally via ingestion (endozoochory) or externally by the attachment of <b>diaspores</b> to the body (ectozoochory). Endozoochory {{is known to be}} the primary means of bird-mediated dispersal for seeds and invertebrates at local, regional, and continental scales. Data supporting the role of bird-mediated endozoochory or ectozoochory in the long distance dispersal of bryophytes remain sparse, however, despite the large number of bryophytes displaying bipolar disjunctions. To determine if transequatorial migrant shorebirds {{may play a role in}} the ectozoochory of bryophyte <b>diaspores,</b> we developed a method for screening feathers of wild birds. We provide the first evidence of microscopic bryophyte <b>diaspores,</b> as well as those from non-bryophyte lineages, embedded in the plumage of long distance transequatorial migrant birds captured in their arctic breeding grounds. The number of <b>diaspores</b> recovered suggests that entire migratory populations may be departing their northern breeding grounds laden with potentially viable plant parts and that they could thereby play significant roles in bipolar range expansions of lineages previously ignored in the migrant bird dispersal literature...|$|R

40|$|The rate of removal by ants of <b>diaspores</b> of 15 species, 10 with elaiosomes, was {{studied in}} dry sclerophyll forest. Two ants were largely responsible, Rhytidoponeva metallica and Aphaenogaster longiceps. The rapid removal of <b>diaspores</b> by ants greatly depletes {{in a very}} short time the readily {{available}} seed supply for regeneration, especially if <b>diaspores</b> are taken to an unsuitable germination site. All plant species but one (Lepidospevma laterale) are placed in established ant dispersal types. A new type, Lepidosperma, is proposed. Eucalyptus seeds lack an appendage and the ant relationship to them is complex. Nevertheless, ants rapidly remove seeds of Eucalyptus when they are offered. Oil in the embryonic cotyledons is probably the food supply. Nests of R. metallica are mostly built in association with pieces of wood while those of A. longiceps occur in the soil. Rate of removal is influenced by distance from the nest, number of ants, time of day or year, size and shape of <b>diaspores</b> and intensity of ‘scent’. Successful dispersal by ants is related to the food source and the type and depth of nest. Food is obtained from appendaged <b>diaspores</b> without damage to the embryo. Seeds in R. metallica nests are unlikely to germinate. Depth of burial will affect germination. seedling emergence and dormancy breaking. Seeds for regeneration of Eucalyptus are probably available through predator satiation.
