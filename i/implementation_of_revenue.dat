Several rate fences (morning-versus-noon, weekday-versus-weekend and time-of-booking-based pricing) received relatively high fairness ratings, whereas location-based and popularity-based pricing were perceived as less fair.

On the other hand, the hotels need to open enough number of segments in order to cater to all categories of potential patrons. Thus determining the right mix of the segments to be opened according to the predicted demand level is a crucial element in implementing revenue management strategies. In this paper, we will try to determine the optimal segmentation mix for a hotel chain in Malaysia using dynamic programming method.

The paper concentrates especially on private healthcare providers and not on the public sector. This is found out to be a new business to study revenue management possibilities.

Not-for-profits like USA Universities are then confronted with different marketing tools: {{some of them are}} typical of for-profits and concern customers, their segmentation and their purchasing-power exploitation; some are, instead, typical of not-for-profits and aim to gain propensity and trustworthiness of donors. The economic and marketing literature counts several contributions about the implementation of marketing, fundraising, investing and other miscellaneous strategies whose final aim is the revenue maximization. From draft application to mature strategies, marketing is exploited by the ‘cultural entrepreneur’ who copes with the eternal trade-off between cultural-artistic purposes and an efficient allocation of resources. As a matter of fact, inside of the organization the competition between marketing experts and fundraisers for the allocation of budget and resources is increasing.

In terms of austerity in which public authorities operate in Romania, balancing local budgets is a current topic and strongly debated. It is a clear difference between earning income communities and communities of sufficient own funds set up not doing any maintenance to cover the village. Communities who occupy the first places have economic, social, demographic benefits, that enable continuous development. Although there is always the tendency to criticize communities that do not have sufficient income,it must be seen that in Europe today the basic concept that builds on development theory is economic and social cohesion. It is believed that the uneven development of the territories actually reflect the economic weaknesses of the combination of which led to political and economic instability. An alternative to this situation is the solidarity of local communities, calculated to maintain a balance between both communities. It is believed that overall healthy economic development can be achieved by a balanced territorial development, and not by widening the existing gaps.

It has allowed to distinguish its following types: scheduled, unscheduled, previous, current, next, state, municipal, specialized, departmental, public, external, internal, solid, selective, comprehensive, effective, ineffective, centralized, decentralized, legislative, realizable, further, active, passive, available, projected, intermediate, final, mixed. The purpose of the article is to provide a classification criteria of budgetary control development, taking into account the role and functions of control in public finance management. The subject of the study is a set of financial relationships arising during the budgetary control due to appropriation of financial resources. Methodology.
