50|$|During the 1970s and 80s free clinics {{continued}} to evolve and change {{to meet the}} needs of their individual communities, however some were unable to survive. Each free clinic was unique in its development and services, based on the particular needs and resources of the local community. There is a saying among free clinic organizations that, if you have been to one free clinic, you have been to all free clinics. The common denominator is that care is made possible through the service of volunteers, the <b>donation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and community support. Funding is generally donated on the local level and there is little —if any— government funding. Some free clinics were established to provide medical services in the inner cities while others opened in the suburbs and many student-run free clinics have emerged that serve the under-served as well as provide a medical training site for students in the health professions.|$|E
40|$|Today, most {{children}} experience {{some form of}} non-parental child care before entering school. The popularity of child care has led scholars to investigate its impact on children's development. In particular, researchers and theorists agree that children benefit when parents and providers form partnerships that include frequent and constructive communication. However, less is known about how parents and providers establish and maintain partnerships. 	I used a qualitative approach to examine how parents of young children and center-based child care providers understand the parent and provider roles and establish and maintain relationships. During a year of field work at two privately-owned child care centers, I generated 112 sets of field notes from participant observations and conducted in-depth semi-structured interviews with 23 parents and 17 child care center staff members. Using both observations and interviews allowed me to witness parent-provider relationship formation firsthand and explore parents' and providers' perspectives. Additionally, generating several different types of data from multiple sources allowed for triangulation and a rigorous research design. I used a modified grounded theory approach to analyze my data. 	My findings suggest that parents and providers saw five components to the provider role: physical caregiving, emotional care, teaching, fostering development, and family support. The parent role had two main components. Child care providers and parents expected that parents {{would be involved in}} the child care center through the <b>donation</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> money and/or time. In addition to involvement in the center, parents also felt responsible for monitoring and directing the providers' caregiving. I identified five distinct parent-provider relationship types: basic familiarity, working relationships, partnerships, independent relationships, and discordant relationships and present a model that explains how these relationships are established and maintained. 	Research and theory suggest that children benefit when parents and providers form partnerships. However, I found that establishing and maintaining partnerships requires time, effort, and a specific skill set from parents and providers as well as opportunities for regular communication. Class-based patterns emerged from my data which suggest that middle-class parents may be {{in a better position to}} form partnerships with their providers. Therefore, it may be unrealistic to expect all parents and providers to work collaboratively. Rather, the benefits of alternative relationship types should be explored. Implications for future research, early care and education programming and the design of measures to assess the quality of parent-provider relationships are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In 2006, {{there were}} 1. 48 million non-profits in the United States. Of those, 190, 000 were religiously {{oriented}} charities. Most charities rely {{at least in}} part on the generosity of others. However, review of the extant literature demonstrated a lack of scales designed to assess an individual’s generosity. Therefore, a scale was developed in order to measure this construct and its related dimensions. A random sample of University students (n= 106) from a small, Christian university and members of a local church (n= 68) chose to participate for a total of 174 participants. The generosity scale was a 14 item self-report scale designed to possess three subscales: charitable (financial) giving (7 items), volunteerism (3 items), and <b>donations</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services (4 items). The {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the validity of the generosity scale by exploring its internal consistency, factor structure and relationship to a scale of spirituality. Results suggest that as originally conceived the subscales for Charity and Donations and the Generosity scale as a whole show adequate internal consistency. Comparison of student and church participants provides some validation for these scales as well. However, the Volunteerism subscale possessed inadequate... ...|$|R

30|$|Although Malawi {{is a small}} country, the Malawian {{dairy sector}} is an {{interesting}} case to study, because it has similar characteristics to the the dairy sectors of several Sub-Saharan Africa countries (Kurwijila and Bennett 2011) such as: the predominance of smallholding production; {{the existence of a}} formal supply chain that markets processed products (e.g., pasteurised milk); an informal sector that markets unprocessed products directly to poor consumers and; a processing sector (part of the formal supply chain) with significant idle capacity. In addition, Malawi has the lowest per-capita consumption of milk in Africa, estimated at 4.7  kg/capita/year compared to an African average of 15  kg/capita/year (Imani Development Consultants 2004; CYE Consult 2009). In this context, different international donors, in apparently uncoordinated efforts, cooperate with the country, in two contrasting ways. On the one hand there is support for improving the formal supply chain through such activities as engaging in knowledge transfer and supplying micro credit. On the other hand, local supply chains are being encouraged through the <b>donation</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>goods</b> to dairy producer cooperatives in order to create local supply chains that can serve consumers directly with pasteurised milk instead of selling the milk to processors.|$|R
