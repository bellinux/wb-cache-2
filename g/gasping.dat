30|$|Results Fifty-one {{percent of}} the 488 {{healthcare}} providers of the four wards responded to the survey. Among them, 77  % mentioned a discomfort when confronted to <b>gasps,</b> when 43 and 91  % of the respondents think that <b>gasps</b> are uncomfortable for the dying child and for the parents, respectively. Consequently, 83  % of the respondents declare that <b>gasps</b> should be ceased, primarily for the parents or the child discomfort, {{but also for the}} healthcare providers. According to the respondents, the efficient treatments against <b>gasps</b> are sedation, analgesia, and neuromuscular blockers. About one-third and two-thirds of the respondents reported that <b>gasps</b> are interfering with their accompaniment of the dying child and of their parents, respectively. Finally, one-third of the respondents declare that they are personally emotionally affected by the occurrence of <b>gasps.</b> Most of the respondents (78  %) state that parents should be informed before the onset of <b>gasps.</b> Avoiding words with negative meanings, they suggest explaining that <b>gasps</b> are not associated with a willingness to survive and are not respiratory movements and further that their occurrence and their length are unpredictable and above all that they are not uncomfortable or painful. Thirty-eight {{percent of the}} respondents declare not knowing the mechanism leading to <b>gasps</b> when 60  % think that <b>gasps</b> are secondary to severe brainstem hypoxia or decerebration.|$|R

5|$|Horses {{are subject}} to equine {{recurrent}} laryngeal neuropathy, a disease of the axons of the recurrent laryngeal nerves. The cause is not known, although a genetic predisposition is suspected. The length of the nerve is a factor since it {{is more common in}} larger horses, and the left side is affected almost exclusively. As the nerve cells die, there is a progressive paralysis of the larynx, causing the airway to collapse. The common presentation is a sound, ranging from a musical whistle to a harsh roar or heaving <b>gasping</b> noise (stertorous), accompanied by worsening performance. The condition is incurable, but surgery can keep the airway open. Experiments with nerve grafts have been tried.|$|E
5|$|The station {{provided}} two permanent crew quarters, the Kayutkas, phonebox-sized booths set {{towards the}} rear of the core module, each featuring a tethered sleeping bag, a fold-out desk, a porthole, and storage for personal effects. Visiting crews had no allocated sleep module, instead attaching a sleeping bag to an available space on a wall; US astronauts installed themselves within Spektr until a collision with a Progress spacecraft caused the depressurisation of that module. It was important that crew accommodations be well ventilated; otherwise, astronauts could wake up oxygen-deprived and <b>gasping</b> for air, because a bubble of their own exhaled carbon dioxide had formed around their heads.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the males}} and females become sexually mature {{by the time they}} are a year-and-a-half old. However, males {{actually}} mate after the age of four to five years. Males and females are most reproductive till the age of 14 and 14–18 years, respectively, with the maximum age of successful lactation in females being 13–14 years. With no fixed breeding season; births may occur at any time of the year. A study at Dvůr Králové Zoo (Czech Republic) showed that 55% of the births occurred between September and December. A rutting male tests the urine of any female he encounters, to which the female responds by urinating. Having located a female in estrus, the male follows her closely, trying to rub his cheek on her rump, head, neck, and chest. He performs <b>gasping</b> movements with his lips. Finally, the male mounts the female, resting his head and neck on her back, in a similar way as other tragelaphines.|$|E

40|$|Polarised {{light from}} astronomical targets can yield {{a wealth of}} {{information}} about their source radiation mechanisms, and about the geometry of the scattered light regions. To date, stellar observations have focused, for the most part, on the linearly polarised component of the optical emission. Observations have been restricted due to inadequate instrumentation, and particularly the need for suitable observing conditions and the availability of luminous targets. The motivation in developing the Galway Astronomical Stokes Polarimeter (<b>GASP)</b> makes possible the ability to observe beyond these sources. <b>GASP</b> is based upon division of amplitude polarimeter (DOAP) (Compain and Drevillon, 1998), which measures the four components of the Stokes vector (I, Q, U and V) simultaneously. This work establishes a suitable optical design that develops <b>GASP</b> as an imaging polarimeter, enabling an acceptable FOV and pixelscale for a 5 -m class telescope. It also focuses on two important aspects of using the <b>GASP</b> polarimeter - the calibration of <b>GASP</b> as an imaging polarimeter, and the application of <b>GASP</b> to astronomical targets. The Eigenvalue Calibration Method (ECM) is used to calibrate <b>GASP</b> by reducing systematic errors as a result of calibration optics. It includes all the optical elements of the polarimeter in the output, including the characteristics of the reference ECM samples. The results of the ECM using <b>GASP</b> as an 8 -detector polarimeter give degree of linear polarisation to accuracies of 0. 2...|$|R
40|$|GPCR {{desensitization}} and down-regulation {{are considered}} key molecular events underlying {{the development of}} tolerance in vivo. Among the many regulatory proteins {{that are involved in}} these complex processes, GASP- 1 have been shown to participate to the sorting of several receptors toward the degradation pathway. This protein belongs to the recently identified GPCR-associated sorting proteins (<b>GASPs)</b> family that comprises ten members for which structural and functional details are poorly documented. We present here a detailed structure-function relationship analysis of the molecular interaction between <b>GASPs</b> and a panel of GPCRs. In a first step, GST-pull down experiments revealed that all the tested <b>GASPs</b> display significant interactions {{with a wide range of}} GPCRs. Importantly, the different <b>GASP</b> members exhibiting the strongest interaction properties were also characterized by the presence of a small, highly conserved and repeated "GASP motif" of 15 amino acids. We further showed using GST-pull down, surface plasmon resonance and co-immunoprecipitation experiments that the central domain of GASP- 1, which contains 22 <b>GASP</b> motifs, is essential for the interaction with GPCRs. We then used site directed mutagenesis and competition experiments with synthetic peptides to demonstrate that the <b>GASP</b> motif, and particularly its highly conserved core sequence SWFW, is critically involved in the interaction with GPCRs. Overall, our data show that several members of the <b>GASP</b> family interact with GPCRs and highlight the presence within <b>GASPs</b> of a novel protein-protein interaction motif that might represent a new target to investigate the involvement of <b>GASPs</b> in the modulation of the activity of GPCRs...|$|R

30|$|Discussion The {{prevalence}} of <b>gasps</b> is {{not found in}} the literature but seems to be high according to pediatricians and neonatologists. <b>Gasp</b> is a reflex of auto-resuscitation that follows a functional decerebration induced by a severe brainstem hypoxia. It is believed that <b>gasps</b> are not painful or uncomfortable for the dying patient although this is debated. Nonetheless, in our study, 43  % of the healthcare providers declare that <b>gasps</b> are uncomfortable for the patient, which is indicating a treatment to stop them. Moreover, 91  % think that they provoke discomfort for the parents and 77  % for the healthcare providers. There exist some case reports about the negative feelings of the parents witnessing <b>gasps,</b> but no studies addressing how healthcare providers confronted to sign of end-of-life in dying child react. Even if <b>gasps</b> are not uncomfortable for the dying child, a treatment would seem to be required to avoid distress of the witnessing parents. However, neuromuscular blockers, the only active compounds against <b>gasps,</b> are related to active euthanasia in ventilator-free children. No official instructions exist on the timing and the content of information to be given to the parents. Some recommendations about the sign of end-of-life suggest informing the family before their onset. Only one-third of the respondents, although working in intensive care units, followed a specific formation for palliative cares or end-of-life. This could explain that more than one-third does not know the mechanisms leading to <b>gasps,</b> resuscitating in part their discomfort.|$|R
