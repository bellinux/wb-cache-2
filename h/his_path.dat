5|$|Kratos {{returns to}} Sparta, {{where he is}} met by Orkos. He praises Kratos' victory over the Furies, but reveals that Kratos will not be free from Ares' bond unless he kills Orkos. He begs Kratos {{to give him an}} honorable death, which will free them both from Ares. Kratos {{initially}} refuses but Orkos' continuing pleas ultimately force Kratos to kill him. Afterward, Kratos experiences the first of many nightmares—previously masked by his bond—and discovers <b>his</b> <b>path</b> to redemption through continual service to Olympus. Kratos burns down his house with the corpse of Orkos inside and leaves, beginning <b>his</b> <b>path</b> towards becoming the champion of the gods.|$|E
5|$|Berger {{had been}} remarkably successful, despite the {{obstacles}} placed in <b>his</b> <b>path</b> by the Wehrmacht, having recruited nearly 60,000 {{men for the}} Waffen-SS between mid-January {{and the end of}} June. These fresh troops were more than sufficient to replace those released when Himmler demobilised several categories of SS reservists in late July. But Himmler knew that the future of the Waffen-SS was assured; Hitler was already considering invading the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{currently}} {{portrayed as}} an underachiever, Bart was actually very happy and looking forward {{about going to}} school. However, the boy's initial enthusiastic nature is crushed by an uncaring and bitter teacher {{who said that he}} would be a failure at life and never amount to anything. Deeply hurt by this comment, Bart then began the process of developing <b>his</b> <b>path</b> into the mischievous way of life.|$|E

5|$|Having firmly {{assisted}} {{and supported}} {{her husband on}} <b>his</b> <b>path</b> to political greatness, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39, leaving him, distraught and bereft of her support, to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted. His premiership of the United Kingdom was shambolic, and lasted barely a year. For over thirty years following her death, he wandered in a political wilderness, directionless and exceedingly eccentric, until his own death in 1929.|$|E
5|$|Parvati's father. Shiva {{wants to}} leave, but Parvati creates the ten fierce Mahavidyas who appear from ten {{directions}} and {{prevent him from}} leaving. In another legend, Shiva is living with Kali, identified as Shiva's consort in this context, but becomes tired of her and wants to leave. Kali creates the Mahavidyas who also obstruct <b>his</b> <b>path</b> from ten directions. Kali enlightens him and he ceases trying to leave.|$|E
5|$|While Donald is {{flipping}} through some books in Scrooge McDuck's library, a map {{falls out of}} a book relating to the treasure of King Garuzia, ruler of the Great Duck Kingdom in ancient times. The map leads {{to the location of}} the king's most prized possession, hidden in a secret place shortly before his death. Donald thinks this is <b>his</b> <b>path</b> to riches. Unfortunately Big Bad Pete overhears and pursues Donald throughout the game hoping to steal the treasure.|$|E

50|$|Many years later, a new Crime Master has {{appeared}} in the Venom series.

5|$|After {{crossing}} the Mississippi River south of Vicksburg at Bruinsburg and driving northeast, Grant won battles at Port Gibson and Raymond and captured Jackson, the Mississippi state capital, on May 14, 1863, forcing Pemberton to withdraw westward. Attempts {{to stop the}} Union advance at Champion Hill and Big Black River Bridge were unsuccessful. Pemberton knew that the corps under Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman was preparing to flank him from the north; {{he had no choice}} but to withdraw or be outflanked. Pemberton burned the bridges over the Big Black River and took everything edible in <b>his</b> <b>path,</b> both animal and plant, as he retreated to the well-fortified city of Vicksburg.|$|E
5|$|Donald is {{armed with}} a special gun that can shoot plungers, popcorn or bubble gum. Donald has {{unlimited}} plungers which can temporarily stun enemies (though bosses can still be damaged with plungers), and can collect popcorn and gum along the way or get the latter from Gyro Gearloose. Later in the game, the plunger is upgraded {{to act as a}} temporary platform to climb walls with and, when stuck to a passing bird, allows Donald to traverse longer distances. In Duckburg, India and Egypt, Donald can also pick up chili peppers which increase his temper, eventually temporarily allowing him to become invincible, increase his speed and knock out enemies in <b>his</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1907, Georges Passerieu {{broke away}} from a small leading group just before Douai because he knew he couldn't outsprint them if they all {{finished}} together. He was chased {{all the way to}} Roubaix by a Belgian, Cyrille van Hauwaert, and tension in the velodrome was high. The crowd heard that Passerieu had reached the stadium but nobody rode on to the track. The leader was just about to ride in when a gendarme stepped into <b>his</b> <b>path</b> to check if his bicycle had the obligatory tax plate attached to it. Passerieu had already had a hard day and a shouting match broke out before he was allowed to continue.|$|E
50|$|Son of {{the writer}} and {{journalist}} Francisco González Ledesma, Enric González denied he wanted to follow <b>his</b> <b>paths</b> until age seventeen, {{when he began to}} write in the Hoja del Lunes de Barcelona, a simple publication usual at that time, as newspapers were not published in Spain on Mondays until the late 1980s.|$|R
60|$|Philammon {{felt himself}} trapped; but, after all, what might not this strange woman do for him? It seemed, if not <b>his</b> only <b>path,</b> still <b>his</b> nearest <b>path</b> to Pelagia; {{and in the}} {{meanwhile}} {{he was in the}} hag's power, and he must submit to his fate; so he took the letters and went out.|$|R

His compositions are carefully contrived and presumably imaginary, normally avoiding all symmetry.|$|R
5|$|In {{high-speed}} territorial {{battles between}} male Australian emperors (Hemianax papuensis), the fighting dragonflies adjust their flight paths to appear stationary to their rivals, minimizing {{the chance of}} being detected as they approach. To achieve the effect, the attacking dragonfly flies towards his rival, choosing <b>his</b> <b>path</b> to remain on a line between the rival {{and the start of}} his attack path. The attacker thus looms larger as he closes on the rival, but does not otherwise appear to move. Researchers found that six of 15 encounters involved motion camouflage.|$|E
5|$|In the ocean, Varaha {{encounters}} Hiranyaksha, who obstructs <b>his</b> <b>path</b> {{and challenges}} {{him to a}} duel. In some versions, the demon also mocks Varaha as the beast and warns him not to touch earth. Ignoring the demon's threats, Varaha lifts the earth on his tusks. Hiranyaksha charges towards the boar in rage with a mace. The two fiercely fight with maces. Finally, Varaha slays the demon after a thousand-year duel. Varaha rises from the ocean with the earth in his tusks and places her gently above it in her original position, as the gods and the sages sing Varaha's praises.|$|E
5|$|Late in that season, the Calgary Flames dealt all-star forward Theoren Fleury, {{along with}} Chris Dingman, to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet, Wade Belak, a draft pick and {{their choice of}} a {{prospect}} from a list provided by Colorado. Impressed with his defensive potential, the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade. His professional career nearly ended before it started, as he was seriously injured {{in an automobile accident}} near Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on July 4, 1999. Regehr, who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother Dinho (Ronald) and two female friends, was struck head-on by another vehicle that crossed into <b>his</b> <b>path.</b> He suffered two broken legs in the crash that killed two people in the other vehicle. Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again.|$|E

5|$|On a Good Friday evening, Ivan Velikopolsky, a 22-year-old sacristan's son and {{clerical}} student, walks {{home and}} imagines that the bitter wind, cold, and darkness he experiences were also felt throughout history: by Rurik, Ivan the Terrible, and Peter the Great. Along <b>his</b> <b>path,</b> he meets Vasilisa and Lukerya, {{a mother and}} her daughter who have both been widowed. As he joins them around their fire, Ivan remarks that the warmth they feel must also have been felt by Saint Peter. Suddenly, he asks if the widows have been reading the Twelve Passion Gospels to which Vasilisa replies that they have.|$|E
5|$|Sonic and the Secret Rings is a {{three-dimensional}} platform and action game featuring an on-rails style of movement. Sonic the Hedgehog, the series' main character, is the game's only player character. He is controlled exclusively with the Wii Remote, which is held horizontally like a traditional gamepad. Players adjust his forward movement by tilting the controller. He runs along a predesignated path; players jump and brake using corresponding face buttons. Thrusting the Wii Remote forwards allows Sonic {{to perform a}} homing attack, a mid-air move that targets and damages enemies in <b>his</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|The royalist armies {{that stayed}} in the Peruvian {{countryside}} headed to Lima, led by Canterac. In a confusing episode, there was no battle, as neither one attacked. Canterac changed <b>his</b> <b>path</b> to El Callao, took resources from it, {{and returned to his}} base. There was no battle during their return either. Without resources, El Callao surrendered in a few days. Both armies took inadvisable actions: San Martín allowed Canterac to receive reinforcements, and Canterac left a key military objective incapable to resist. There is no known documentation that provides a reasonable explanation of those events.|$|E
50|$|Numerous {{researchers}} {{have tried to}} trace his route across the Southwest. As he did not begin writing his chronicle until back in Spain, he {{had to rely on}} memory. Cabeza de Vaca was uncertain of his route.

5|$|While meditating with Finn and Jake, Princess Bubblegum has {{a premonition}} {{involving}} the Lich, an evil undead sorcerer who was long ago {{trapped in a}} block of amber by the legendary hero Billy. Bubblegum tells Finn and Jake about the dream, {{and the three of}} them journey to the tree at the top of Bubblegum's palace where the block of amber is hidden; Bubblegum also places magical jewels on Finn and Jake's heads that will prevent the Lich from exerting mind-control on them. While examining the amber, a snail is placed under the Lich's spell and helps break him out while Finn and Jake are not paying attention. The Lich then blasts out of the kingdom, leaving a wave of destruction in <b>his</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5|$|Whilst Allied {{preparations}} had progressed, the French were {{striving to}} maintain and re-supply Marshal Marsin. Marsin had been operating with the Elector of Bavaria against the Imperial commander, Prince Louis of Baden, and was somewhat isolated from France: his only lines of communication lay through the rocky passes of the Black Forest. However, on 14 May, with considerable skill Marshal Tallard managed to bring 10,000 reinforcements and vast supplies and munitions through the difficult terrain, whilst outmanoeuvring Baron Thüngen, the Imperial general who sought to block <b>his</b> <b>path.</b> Tallard then returned with his own force to the Rhine, once again side-stepping Thüngen's efforts to intercept him. The whole operation was an outstanding military achievement.|$|E
5|$|After his {{two and a}} {{half years}} of training, Naruto returns to Konoha and begins to deal more {{actively}} with the Akatsuki threat by saving Gaara from their clutches. To fight them, Naruto trains with Kakashi to infuse the Rasengan with his own wind-element chakra, creating the Rasen-Shuriken attack that proves instrumental in the downfall of the Akatsuki member Kakuzu. Despite being targeted by the Akatsuki, Naruto dedicates himself to finding and retrieving Sasuke; he eventually disposes of Orochimaru and starts acting on his vengeance-driven whims. Over time, though resisting the urge to use the creature's power, the Nine Tails's influence over him expands to the point where he begins to lose his rationality as more chakra manifests in the form of tails to the point the Tailed Beast can take control of his body. This ultimately causes him to go on a rampage, destroying everything in <b>his</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
