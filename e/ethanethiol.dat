50|$|<b>Ethanethiol,</b> {{commonly}} known as ethyl mercaptan, is a clear liquid with a distinct odor. It is an organosulfur compound with the formula CH3CH2SH. Abbreviated EtSH, it consists of an ethyl group (Et), CH3CH2, attached to a thiol group, SH. Its structure parallels that of ethanol, but with sulfur in place of oxygen. The odor of EtSH is infamous. <b>Ethanethiol</b> is more volatile than ethanol due to a diminished ability to engage in hydrogen bonding. <b>Ethanethiol</b> is toxic. It occurs naturally as a minor component of petroleum, and may be added to otherwise odorless gaseous products such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) to help warn of gas leaks. At these concentrations, <b>ethanethiol</b> is not harmful.|$|E

50|$|<b>Ethanethiol</b> is a reagent {{in organic}} synthesis. In the {{presence}} of sodium hydroxide, it gives the powerful nucleophile SEt−. The salt can be generated quantitatively by reaction with sodium hydride.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethanethiol</b> is {{intentionally}} {{added to}} butane and propane (see: LPG) to impart an easily noticed smell to these normally odorless fuels that pose {{the threat of}} fire, explosion, and asphyxiation.|$|E
50|$|<b>Ethanethiol</b> {{can also}} be {{prepared}} by a halide displacement reaction, where ethyl halide is reacted with aqueous sodium bisulfide. This conversion was demonstrated as early as 1840 by Henri Victor Regnault.|$|E
50|$|In {{the above}} reaction, RSH is a {{mercaptan}} and R signifies an organic group {{such as a}} methyl, ethyl, propyl or other group. For example, the ethyl mercaptan (<b>ethanethiol)</b> has the formula C2H5SH.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ethanethiol</b> was {{originally}} reported by Zeise in 1834. [...] Zeise treated calcium ethyl sulfate with a suspension of barium sulfide saturated with hydrogen sulfide. He {{is credited with}} naming the C2H5S- group as mercaptum.|$|E
50|$|Natural gas {{distributors}} {{were required}} to add thiols, originally <b>ethanethiol,</b> to natural gas (which is naturally odorless) after the deadly New London School explosion in New London, Texas, in 1937. Many gas distributors were odorizing gas prior to this event. Most gas odorants utilized currently contain mixtures of mercaptans and sulfides, with t-butyl mercaptan as the main odor constituent in natural gas and <b>ethanethiol</b> in liquefied petroleum gas (LPG, propane). In situations where thiols are used in commercial industry, such as liquid petroleum gas tankers and bulk handling systems, an oxidizing catalyst is used to destroy the odor. A copper-based oxidation catalyst neutralizes the volatile thiols and transforms them into inert products.|$|E
5000|$|Diethyl sulfide is a {{by-product}} of the commercial production of <b>ethanethiol,</b> which is prepared by the reaction of ethylene with hydrogen sulfide over an alumina-based catalyst.

Its odor resembles that of leeks, onions, durian or cooked cabbage, but is quite distinct.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{underground}} mining industry, <b>ethanethiol</b> or ethyl mercaptan {{is referred to}} as [...] "stench gas". [...] The gas is released into mine ventilation systems to alert mine workers during an emergency. In Ontario, mining legislation dictates that [...] "The alarm system in an underground mine shall, consist of the introduction into all workplaces of sufficient quantities of ethyl mercaptan gas or similar gas to be readily detectable by all workers".|$|E
5000|$|Raw {{natural gas}} {{consists}} primarily of methane (CH4), the shortest and lightest hydrocarbon molecule, {{as well as}} various amounts of heavier hydrocarbon gases such as ethane (C2H6), propane (C3H8), normal butane (n-C4H10), isobutane (i-C4H10), pentanes and even higher molecular weight hydrocarbons. The raw gas also contains various amounts of acid gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and mercaptans such as methanethiol (CH3SH) and <b>ethanethiol</b> (C2H5SH).|$|E
50|$|Propylene, butylenes {{and various}} other {{hydrocarbons}} are usually also present in small concentrations. HD-5 limits the amount of propylene that can be placed in LPG to 5%, and is utilized as an autogas specification. A powerful odorant, <b>ethanethiol,</b> is added so that leaks can be detected easily. The internationally recognized European Standard is EN 589. In the United States, tetrahydrothiophene (thiophane) or amyl mercaptan are also approved odorants, although neither is currently being utilized.|$|E
50|$|Propene (also called propylene) {{can be a}} {{contaminant}} {{of commercial}} propane. Propane containing too much propene is not suited for most vehicle fuels. HD-5 is a specification that establishes a maximum concentration of 5% propene in propane. Propane and other LP gas specifications are established in ASTM D-1835. All propane fuels include an odorant, almost always <b>ethanethiol,</b> {{so that people can}} easily smell the gas in case of a leak. Propane as HD-5 was originally intended for use as vehicle fuel. HD-5 is currently being used in all propane applications.|$|E

However, there is great synthetic utility in the variety of reactions one can carry out, by varying the diazoalkyl and weak acid. The migrating group, R1 migrates with complete retention. A very useful application of the Arndt-Eistert homologation forms the homologated aldehyde by either trapping the ketene with N-methyl aniline and reducing with lithium aluminum hydride, or trapping the ketene with <b>ethanethiol</b> and reducing with Raney nickel.|$|E

50|$|The amide tail {{synthesis}} (scheme 7) {{was based}} on an asymmetric Aldol reaction. The starting compound is the commercially available Benzyloxyacetic acid 53 which was converted to the thio ester 55 (<b>Ethanethiol)</b> through the acid chloride 54 (thionyl chloride, pyridine). This formed the silyl enol ether 55 (n-butyllithium, trimethylsilyl chloride, Diisopropylamine) which reacted with chiral amine catalyst 58, tin triflate and nBu2(OAc)2 in a Mukaiyama aldol addition with benzaldehyde to alcohol 59 with 99% anti selectivity and 96% ee. The next step converting the alcohol group to an amine in 60 was a Mitsunobu reaction (hydrogen azide, diethyl azodicarboxylate, triphenylphosphine with azide reduction to amine by Ph3P). The amine group was benzoylated with benzoyl chloride (61) and hydrolysis removes the thioether group in 62.|$|E
50|$|Starting {{material}} for this preparation is ketoester 1, available {{by one of the}} classical benzomorphan syntheses. Condensation with the ylide from Triethyl phosphonoacetate (HWE reaction) affords diester 2. Catalytic hydrogenation proceeds from the less hindered face to afford the corresponding saturated diester (3). The esters are then reduced by means of LiAlH4 to give the glycol (4); this undergoes internal ether formation on treatment with acid to form the pyran ring of 5. Von Braun reaction with BrCN (or ethyl chloroformate) followed by saponification of the intermediate leads to the 2° amine (6). This is converted to the cyclopropylmethyl derivative 8 by acylation with cyclopropylcarbonyl chloride followed by reduction of the thus formed amide (7) with LiAlH4. Cleave of the O-methyl ether with sodium <b>Ethanethiol</b> affords proxorphan (9).|$|E
50|$|Many thiols {{have strong}} odors {{resembling}} that of garlic. The odors of thiols, {{particularly those of}} low molecular weight, are often strong and repulsive. The spray of skunks consists mainly of low-molecular-weight thiols and derivatives. These compounds are detectable by the human nose at concentrations of only 10 parts per billion. Human sweat contains (R)/(S)-3-methyl-3-sulfanylhexan-1-ol (MSH), detectable at 2 parts per billion and having a fruity, onion-like odor. (Methylthio)methanethiol (MeSCH2SH; MTMT) is a strong-smelling volatile thiol, also detectable at parts per billion levels, found in male mouse urine. Lawrence C. Katz and co-workers showed that MTMT functioned as a semiochemical, activating certain mouse olfactory sensory neurons, attracting female mice. Copper {{has been shown to}} be required by a specific mouse olfactory receptor, MOR244-3, which is highly responsive to MTMT as well as to various other thiols and related compounds. A human olfactory receptor, OR2T11, has been identified which, in the presence of copper, is highly responsive to the gas odorants (see below) <b>ethanethiol</b> and t-butyl mercaptan as well as other low molecular weight thiols, including allyl mercaptan found in human garlic breath, and the strong-smelling cyclic sulfide thietane.|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>ethanethiol</b> removal in biotrickling filter was investigated by microorganisms fixed on iron oxide-based porous ceramsite (IPC) under different operating parameters conditions. <b>Ethanethiol</b> removal efficiency was examined {{as a function}} of inlet concentration, empty bed residence time (EBRT), and spray density of nutrient solution. The results showed that the optimized operation conditions and operation characteristics of biotrickling filter for this study were at the inlet concentration of less than 250 [*]mg·m− 3, the spray density of 0. 24 [*]m 3 ·m− 2 [*]h− 1, and the EBRT of 68. 7 [*]s. The variation of the EBRT of about 100 [*]s and the spray density of about 0. 24 [*]m 3 ·m− 2 [*]h− 1 did not change the <b>ethanethiol</b> removal efficiencies at certain <b>ethanethiol</b> concentrations of less than about 300 [*]mg/m 3, respectively. The main metabolic product was sulfate such as SO 42 - under continuous long-running regime in filter.

40|$|A {{variety of}} {{environmental}} samples was screened for anaerobic degradation of methanethiol, <b>ethanethiol,</b> propanethiol, dimethylsulfide, and dimethyldisulfide. All sludge and sediment samples degraded methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, and dimethyldisulfide anaerobically. In contrast, <b>ethanethiol</b> and propanethiol were not degraded by the samples investigated under {{any of the}} conditions tested. Methanethiol, dimethylsulfide, and dimethyldisulfide were mainly degraded by methanogenic archaea. In the presence of sulfate and the methanogenic inhibitor bromoethane sulfonate, degradation of these compounds coupled to sulfate reduction occurred as well, but at much lower rates. Besides their biodegradability, also the toxicity of methanethiol, <b>ethanethiol,</b> and propanethiol to methanogenesis with methanol, acetate, and H 2 /CO 2 as the substrates was assessed. The 50 % inhibition concentration of methanethiol on the methane production from these substrates ranged between 7 and 10 mM. The 50 % inhibition concentration values of <b>ethanethiol</b> and propanethiol for the degradation of methanol and acetate were between 6 and 8 mM, whereas hydrogen consumers were less affected by <b>ethanethiol</b> and propanethiol, as indicated by their higher 50 % inhibition concentration (14 mM). Sulfide inhibited methanethiol degradation already at relatively low concentrations: methanethiol degradation was almost completely inhibited at an initial sulfide concentration of 8 mM.

40|$|Vibrational {{spectra of}} vapor-phase <b>ethanethiol</b> and tert-butylthiol have been {{recorded}} in the 1000 to 12 000 cm− 1 region. Both the gauche and trans conformers of <b>ethanethiol</b> are observed.

The relative strength of the SH-stretching vibrations in <b>ethanethiol</b> and tert-butylthiol compared with the OH-stretching vibrations in the corresponding alcohols are 0. 2 in the fundamental region and 0. 03 in the overtone regions. The SH- and OH-stretching intensities have been modeled with an anharmonic oscillator local mode model with ab initio calculated dipole moment functions. The weak nature of SH-stretching transitions is shown to be a result of both low anharmonicity of the vibrational mode and relatively small dipole moment derivatives...|$|E
