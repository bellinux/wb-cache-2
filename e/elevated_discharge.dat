40|$|AbstractRivers and {{turbidity}} currents are the {{two most}} important sediment transport processes by volume on Earth. Various hypotheses have been proposed for triggering of turbidity currents offshore from river mouths, including direct plunging of river discharge, delta mouth bar flushing or slope failure caused by low tides and gas expansion, earthquakes and rapid sedimentation. During 2011, 106 turbidity currents were monitored at Squamish Delta, British Columbia. This enables statistical analysis of timing, frequency and triggers. The largest peaks in river discharge did not create hyperpycnal flows. Instead, delayed delta-lip failures occurred 8 – 11 h after flood peaks, due to cumulative delta top sedimentation and tidally-induced pore pressure changes. <b>Elevated</b> river <b>discharge</b> is thus a significant control on the timing and rate of turbidity currents but not directly due to plunging river water. <b>Elevated</b> river <b>discharge</b> and focusing of river discharge at low tides cause increased sediment transport across the delta-lip, which is the most significant of all controls on flow timing in this setting...|$|R

The difference of shuttle radar topography mission (SRTM) and 2003 light detection and ranging (LiDAR) DEM indicated the topographic changes before 2006 mudslide, and the combination of time-series InSAR analysis and old-dated DEM (2000 SRTM, 2003 LiDAR DEM) revealed topographic changes associated with the 2006 sliding event.

To determine the specificity of the state-related behaviour of MnPN neurons we have undertaken the first study of their discharge patterns across the sleep-waking cycle. Nearly 76 % of recorded cells exhibited <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> rates during sleep. Sleep-related units showed several distinct types of activity changes across sleep stages. Two populations included cells displaying selective activation during either non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep (10 %) or REM sleep (8 %).

Most of these cells showed a gradual increase in their firing rates prior to sleep onset, <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> during NREM sleep and a further increase during REM sleep. This specific sleep-waking discharge profile is opposite to that demonstrated by wake-promoting monoaminergic cell groups and was previously found in cells localized in the ventrolateral preoptic area (vlPOA).

40|$|The {{measure of}} the water {{discharge}} in rivers is important within the cognitive actions addressed to identify a management policy concerning the water resources. In particular, {{it is essential for}} a planning of the interventions in a middle and long term in relation to the control activity and environmental protection respectly to the forecasting and prevention of natural hazard. The measure methods in natural channels are generally based on the use of hydrometers combined with rating curves in steady flows. The relation between water level and discharge is determined by measures of velocities in conditions of low and mean flows, and more rarely during high flows. In the latter case, practical difficulties in measurement lead to extrapolate discharge values on statistical basis which could involve significant errors in rating curves at high levels. Furthermore the steady rating curve cannot to estimate in rigorous way the discharges in presence of sediment transport, which often happens with the high flows modifying the geometrical and morphological river characteristics. In this context, the present work describes a numerical-experimental approach to estimate the water discharges on the basis of numerical models at fixed and mobile bed, calibrated by simultaneous measure series of water level and velocities in gauged stations. In the first step, the application of fixed bed model allowed a more accurate extrapolation of rating curves for <b>elevated</b> <b>discharges</b> through the roughness coefficient correction. Successively the use of the mobile bed model, considering simplified hypothesis, allowed to analyze the sediment transport effects on rating curve shape. The reliability of such approach has been evaluated on a gauged section located upstream a single thread alluvial reach in the middle valley of the Noce River in Basilicata region (Italy). This reach is characterized by a narrow and confined bed, which was interested by a progressive morpho-hydrodynamic change caused by a landslide in the right side slope of the basin in July 2007...|$|R

Based on the model’s projections, the decoupled floodplain was predicted to have more areas of high potential denitrification during mean and <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge,</b> but with more sites dominated by incomplete denitrification, resulting in higher N 2 O emission. In the restored floodplain, frequently inundated, the model predicted that lower rates of denitrification would occur at lower river discharge levels, dominated by complete denitrification, resulting in N 2 rather than N 2 O production. During an annual flood (5300 m 3 s– 1), flooding both floodplains, the restored floodplain was predicted to have more areas of high potential denitrification activity than the decoupled floodplain. The model outputs suggest that floodplains subject to frequent inundations can effectively and efficiently use nitrate input from the main river channel, resulting in complete denitrification.

Experimental manipulations of food {{quality and quantity}} were achieved by diluting riverine suspended particulate matter (seston) to obtain a range of food concentrations and by amending natural seston with laboratory-grown Scenedesmus acutus. Bosmina experienced food limitation during periods of <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> when the P content of seston was low (C: P. 600). Growth rates covaried with body RNA and P contents (R 2 5 0. 96 and 0. 86, respectively; content expressed as percent of dry mass), {{which is consistent with}} the hypothesis that high growth rates require increased allocation to P-rich ribosomal RNA and that high seston C: P induces P limitation in riverine Bosmina. P limitation arises in riverine consumers of riverine seston when hydrologic conditions favor terrestrial inputs, sediment resuspension, and low algal productivity, thereby resulting in seston fractions dominated by P-poor materials. During low discharge, riverine seston was P-rich relative to Bosmina requirements and growth rates were decoupled from body P content. Bosmina RNA content was strongly and linearly related to growth over a broad range of resource conditions, suggesting that it may be a useful surrogate to assess dietary sufficiency of food resources in natural settings...|$|E

Peak mortality of inshore dolphins and dugongs followed sustained periods of <b>elevated</b> freshwater <b>discharge</b> (9 months) and low air temperature (3 months).

40|$|Rapid {{growth of}} the economy in China has been coupled with {{increasing}} environmental pollution. The coastal and estuarine ecosystems in China are now facing increasing metal pollution pressures because of the <b>elevated</b> metal <b>discharges</b> from various sources. Industrial and domestic sewage discharges, mining, smelling, e-wastes recycling are important sources contributing to coastal pollution in China. In this review, status of metal contamination along China's coasts is assessed by a comprehensive review of metal concentrations recorded in sediments and marine organisms over the past ten years. Studies show that metal contamination in the coastal environments is closely associated with accelerated economic growth in the past decades. High metal contents can be detected in the sediments collected across the coasts in China. Alarmingly high metal concentrations are observed in the sediments, water and organisms collected from the heavily industrialized areas. Metal levels observed in marine bivalves also consistently reflect the elevated metal contamination. Elevated levels of metal contamination along China's coastal environment can increase the risk of metal exposure to humans by seafood consumption, raising the alarm for more stringent control of discharge of metals into environment.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the load of Escherichia coli transferred via drainage waters from drained and undrained pasture following a grazing period. Higher concentrations (ranging between 104 and 103 CFU g- 1) of E. coli persisted in soil for up to 60 days beyond the point where cattle were removed from the plots, but these eventually declined in the early months of spring to concentrations less than 102 CFU g- 1. The decline reflects the combined effect of cell depletion from the soil store through both wash-out and die-off of E. coli. No difference (P  0. 05) was observed in E. coli loads exported from drained and undrained plots. Similarly, no difference (P  0. 05) was observed in E. coli concentrations in drainage waters of mole drain flow and overland plus subsurface interflow. Intermittent periods of <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> associated with storm events mobilised E. coli at higher concentrations (e. g. in excess of 400 CFU ml- 1) than observed during low flow conditions (often < 25 CFU ml- 1).

40|$|Parkinsonism {{leads to}} various {{electrophysiological}} {{changes in the}} basal ganglia-thalamocortical system (BGTCS), often including <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> rates of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and the output nuclei, and reduced activity of the globus pallidus external segment (GPe). These rate changes have been explained qualitatively {{in terms of the}} direct/indirect pathway model, involving projections of distinct striatal populations to the output nuclei and GPe. Although these populations partly overlap, evidence suggests dopamine depletion differentially affects cortico-striato-pallidal connection strengths to the two pallidal segments. Dopamine loss may also decrease the striatal signal-to-noise ratio, reducing both corticostriatal coupling and striatal firing thresholds. Here we present a mean-field model of the BGTCS with structure and parameter estimates closely based on physiology and anatomy. Changes in firing rates due to modeled dopamine loss are compared with experiment. Our results suggest that a stronger indirect pathway, possibly combined with a weakened direct pathway, is compatible with empirical evidence. However, altered corticostriatal connection strengths are probably not solely responsible for substantially increased STN activity often found. A lower STN firing threshold, weaker intracortical inhibition, and stronger striato-GPe inhibition help explain the relatively large increase in STN rate. Changes in cortex, GPe, and STN help normalize the cortical rate, also in accord with experiments. The model integrates the basal ganglia into a unified framework along with an existing thalamocortical model that accounts {{for a wide range of}} electrophysiological phenomena.

40|$|In the {{previous}} {{studies on the}} neural control of saccade initiation using the countermanding paradigm, movement and visuomovement neurons in the frontal eye field were grouped as movement-related neurons. The activity of both types of neurons was modulated when a saccade was inhibited {{in response to a}} stop signal, and this modulation occurred early enough to contribute to the control of the saccade initiation. We now report a functional difference between these two classes of neurons when saccades are produced. Movement neurons exhibited a progressive accumulation of discharge rate following target presentation that triggered a saccade when it reached a threshold. When saccades were inhibited with lower probability in response to a stop signal appearing at longer delays, this accumulating activity was interrupted at levels progressively closer to the threshold. In contrast, visuomovement neurons exhibited a maintained <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> rate following target presentation that was followed by a further enhancement immediately before the saccade initiation. When saccades were inhibited in response to a stop signal, the late enhancement was absent and the maintained activity decayed regardless of stop-signal delay. These results demonstrate that the activity of movement neurons realizes the progressive commitment to the saccade initiation modeled by the activation of the go unit in computational models of countermanding performance. The lack of correspondence of the activity of visuomovement neurons with any elements of these models indicates that visuomovement neurons perform a function other than the saccade preparation such as a corollary discharge to update visual processing...|$|E
40|$|The frontal eye field (FEF) and {{superior}} colliculus (SC) contribute to saccadic eye movement generation, {{and much of}} the FEF's oculomotor influence may be mediated through the SC. The present study examined the composition and topographic organization of signals flowing from FEF to SC by recording from FEF neurons that were antidromically activated from rostral or caudal SC. The first and most general result was that, in a sample of 88 corticotectal neurons, the types of signals relayed from FEF to SC were highly diverse, reflecting the general population of signals within FEF rather than any specific subset of signals. Second, many neurons projecting from FEF to SC carried signals thought to reflect cognitive operations, namely tonic discharges during the delay period of a delayed-saccade task (delay signals), <b>elevated</b> <b>discharges</b> during the gap period of a gap task (gap increase signals), or both. Third, FEF neurons discharging during fixation were found to project to the SC, although they did not project preferentially to rostral SC, where similar fixation neurons are found. Neurons that did project preferentially to the rostral SC were those with foveal visual responses and those pausing during the gap period of the gap task. Many of the latter neurons also had foveal visual responses, presaccadic pauses in activity, and postsaccadic increases in activity. These two types of rostral-projecting neurons therefore may contribute to the activity of rostral SC fixation neurons. Fourth, conduction velocity was used as an indicator of cell size to correct for sampling bias. The outcome of this correction procedure suggested that among the most prevalent neurons in the FEF corticotectal population are those carrying putative cognitive-related signals, i. e., delay and gap increase signals, and among the least prevalent are those carrying presaccadic burst discharges but lacking peripheral visual responses. Fifth, corticotectal neurons carrying various signals were biased topographically across the FEF. Neurons with peripheral visual responses but lacking presaccadic burst discharges were biased laterally, neurons with presaccadic burst discharges but lacking peripheral visual responses were biased medially, and neurons carrying delay or gap increase signals were biased dorsally. Finally, corticotectal neurons were distributed within the FEF as a function of their visual or movement field eccentricity and projected to the SC such that eccentricity maps in both structures were closely aligned. We conclude that the FEF most likely influences the activity of SC neurons continuously from the start of fixation, through visual analysis and cognitive manipulations, until a saccade is generated and fixation begins anew. Furthermore, the projection from FEF to SC is highly topographically organized in terms of function at both its source and its termination...|$|R

A comparison of two 65 -year data sets (1876 – 1940 and 1941 – 2005) of average daily flows did not show any significant change in the basic statistical characteristics of the Danube river discharge. The analysis of the long-term average monthly Danube discharges revealed, that in the last 25 years the discharge rates increased in the winter half-year, while a decline was observed between June and August.

The pristine soil (silty clay loam) was characterized by a low hydraulic conductivity, but the agricultural practice first, and then the rooting system increased the permeability of the top soil. This was confirmed by the <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> in the outflow ditch and by the elevated hydraulic conductivity values determined via slug tests. The groundwater residence time was monitored, once the rooting system was completely developed, via Rhodamine-WT injection in the inflow ditch.

In addition, a three-dimensional flow and transport model (MODFLOW and MT 3 DMS) was calibrated using piezometric heads, groundwater fluxes and Rhodamine-WT concentrations. The CXTFIT model overestimated the dispersivity and underestimated velocity respect to MT 3 DMS. This study shows that residence time can decrease respect to the value expected from the hydraulic conductivities of the pristine soils and that one-dimensional analytical models can give a false impression compared with soil parameters respect to three-dimensional flow and transport models.

Neuroanatomic studies have demonstrated free and encap-sulated nerve endings in facet joints as well as nerves containing substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide. Neurophysiologic studies have shown that facet-joint capsules contain low-threshold mechanoreceptors, mechani-cally sensitive nociceptors, and silent nociceptors. Inflammation leads to decreased thresholds of nerve endings in facet capsules as well as <b>elevated</b> baseline <b>discharge</b> rates. Recent biomechanical studies suggest that rear-end motor-vehicle impacts give rise to excessive deformation of the capsules of lower cervical facet joints. Still unre-solved is whether this stretch is sufficient to activate nociceptors in the joint capsule. To answer this question, recent studies indicate that low stretch levels activate proprioceptors in the facet-joint cap-sule. Excessive capsule stretch activates nociceptors, leads to prolonged neural afterdischarges, and can cause damage to the capsule and to axons in the capsule. In instances in which a whiplash event is severe enough to injure the joint capsule, facet capsule overstretch is a possible cause of persistent neck pain.

40|$|Background-—B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is {{a marker}} for heart failure (HF) severity, but its {{association}} with hospital readmission is not well defined. Methods and Results-—We identified all hospital discharges (n= 109 875) with a primary diagnosis of HF in the Veterans Affairs Health Care System from 2006 to 2009. We examined the association between admission (n= 53 585), discharge (n= 24 326), and change in BNP (n= 7187) and 30 -day readmission for HF or other causes. Thirty-day HF readmission was associated with elevated admission BNP, <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> BNP, and smaller percent change in BNP from admission to discharge. Patients with a discharge BNP ≥ 1000 ng/L had an unadjusted 30 -day HF readmission rate over 3 times as high as patients whose discharge BNP was ≤ 200 ng/L (15 % vs. 4. 1 %). BNP improved discrimination and risk classification for 30 -day HF readmission when added to a base clinical model, with discharge BNP having the greatest effect (C-statistic, 0. 639 to 0. 664 [P< 0. 0001]; net reclassification improvement, 9 % [P< 0. 0001]). In contrast, 30 -day readmission for non-HF causes {{was not associated with}} BNP levels during index HF hospitalization. Conclusions-—In this study of over 50 000 veterans hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of HF, BNP levels measured during hospitalization were associated with 30 -day HF readmission, but not readmissions for other causes. These data may help guide future study aimed at identifying the optimal timing for hospital discharge and help allocate high-intensity, HF-specific transitional care interventions to the patients most likely to benefit.

40|$|Dry land {{salinisation}} is {{a significant}} cause of land and water degradation in Australia. Changing land use from annual to perennial crops has been widely proposed {{as a means to}} reduce land degradation and increase the productivity of saline land. However, in many areas annual crops are financially more attractive than perennial crops. Increases in perennial crops might also reduce local stream flows with adverse effects on in-stream values. As such salinity control is likely to involve significant tradeoffs between public and private costs and benefits. This paper considers the impact of planting differing areas of pastoral and woody perennials on farm profitability (P), and water (W) and salt (S) exports from the Little River catchment in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The analysis uses two linear programming (LP) models. The first model represents a mixed crop and sheep system and the outputs of this model are integrated to provide inputs to a second catchment level model. The structure of the LP models is described and an analysis of the potential for perennials to assist in salinity management is presented. The implications of the analysis for farm systems and catchment scale changes in land use are considered. The study highlighted the importance of targeting management decisions to individual sub-catchments and of using relatively detailed farm level models as part of a catchment level study. The potential for perennials to contribute to profitable and robust farm systems and to reduce degradation to land from salt scalds and to streams arising with <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge</b> and wash-off of salt is demonstrated.

40|$|Wildfires alter land {{surfaces}} and land-atmosphere interactions, causing enhanced runoff and debris flows. The current study evaluates hydrologic behavior and recovery for three watersheds in the {{burned in the}} 2010 Bull Fire in the southern Sequoia National Forest. One unburned watershed was selected outside the fire perimeter for a control. The effects of wildfires have been extensively analyzed, but these studies typically focus on debris flows immediately following the fire and vegetation recovery on a plot-scale. This study attempts to evaluate hydrologic recovery through in-situ instruments in areas analyzed by a United States Forest Service Burned Area Emergency Response team. Many agencies attempt to predict post-fire runoff peaks and volumes to identify values-at-risk and determine if protective measures must be implemented. The four study sites are instrumented with tipping buckets and pressure transducers to measure precipitation and discharge throughout the approximate two year study period. Stream discharge is measured at five-minute intervals, the tipping buckets are event-based to track storm duration and intensity, and channel cross-sections are measured every two months to detail sediment deposition or scour that accompany rainfall-runoff events. Precipitation {{was found to be}} consistent between the study areas, but a link between precipitation and cross-section area changes was not determined. Geomorphic parameters were evaluated with an area-normalized discharge to determine correlations. Aspect, soil type, and watershed shape were found to be the controlling factors in <b>elevated</b> <b>discharge.</b> To judge watershed recovery, the response lag, lag-to-peak, and runoff ratio were calculated for 13 selected storms across all study sites. Variability of each parameter was determined to depend on the precipitation tipping bucket location and the time between storms. Recovery was unable to be determined based on the three rainfall-runoff hydrograph parameters. Future work involves relating a remote sensing vegetation index with the storm parameters to couple vegetation recovery with hydrologic recovery and gain insight into watershed recovery on a storm-by-storm basis...|$|E
40|$|Loudness recruitment, an {{abnormally}} {{rapid growth}} of perceived loudness with sound level, is a common symptom of sensorineural hearing loss. Following acoustic trauma, auditory-nerve rate responses are reduced, and rate grows more slowly with sound level, which seems inconsistent with recruitment (Heinz et al., J. Assoc. Res. Otolaryngol. 6 : 91 – 105, 2005). However, rate-level functions (RLFs) in {{the central nervous system}} may increase in either slope or saturation value following trauma (e. g., Salvi et al., Hear. Res. 147 : 261 – 274, 2000), suggesting that recruitment may arise from central changes. In this paper, we studied RLFs of neurons in ventral cochlear nucleus (VCN) of the cat after acoustic trauma. Trauma did not change the general properties of VCN neurons, and the usual VCN functional classifications remained valid (chopper, primary-like, onset, etc.). After trauma, non-primary-like neurons, most noticeably choppers, exhibited <b>elevated</b> maximum <b>discharge</b> rates and steeper RLFs for frequencies at and near best frequency (BF). Primary-like neurons showed the opposite changes. To relate the neurons’ responses to recruitment, rate-balance functions were computed; these show the sound level required to give equal rates in a normal and a traumatized ear and are analogous to loudness balance functions that show the sound levels giving equal perceptual loudness in the two ears of a monaurally hearing-impaired person. The ratebalance functions showed recruitment-like steepenin...|$|R
40|$|Background: This report {{builds on}} a {{previous}} analysis examining {{the long-term effects of}} a placebo period on a group of inpatients with chronic schizophrenia. In the present analysis, outcome was evaluated through the use of the Psychiatric Adverse Events Rating Scale. Methods: This retrospective analysis examined adverse events for 55 patients with chronic schizophrenia who were placed in a double-blind placebo study on the inpatient units of the National Institute of Mental Health Neuropsychiatric Research Hospital. The number and severity of adverse events experienced by these patients during baseline, placebo, and discharge periods were analyzed. Results: The frequency and severity of adverse events for this group of patients were modest. Most patients did not experience a statistically significant increase in adverse events during their placebo phase; however, a subgroup of patients who were hospitalized for less than 2 months after antipsychotic medications were restored did experience a statistical elevation in adverse events, and that frequency remained statistically <b>elevated</b> at <b>discharge.</b> Conclusions: The results confirm the findings from our previous analysis. Regardless of whether outcome is measured by a behavioral rating scale or by an adverse event scale, given a sufficiently lengthy recovery period, patients with chronic schizophrenia who go through a placebo phase return to baseline.

40|$|Working {{memory has}} been linked to <b>elevated</b> single neuron <b>discharge</b> in monkeys and to oscillatory changes in the human EEG, but the {{relation}} between these effects has remained largely unexplored. We addressed this question by measuring local field potentials and single unit activity simultaneously from multiple electrodes placed in extrastriate visual cortex while monkeys were performing a working memory task. We describe a significant enhancement in theta band energy during the delay period. Theta oscillations had a systematic effect on single neuron activity, with neurons emitting more action potentials near their preferred angle of each theta cycle. Sample-selective delay activity was enhanced if only action potentials emitted near the preferred theta angle were considered. Our results suggest that extrastriate visual cortex is involved in short-term maintenance of information and that theta oscillations provide a mechanism for structuring the recurrent interaction between neurons in different brain regions that underlie working memory...|$|R
