5|$|The {{internal}} {{volume is}} commonly quoted {{in most countries}} using the metric system. This information is required by ISO13769 to be stamped on the cylinder shoulder. It can be measured easily by filling the cylinder with fresh water. This {{has resulted in the}} term 'water capacity', abbreviated as WC which is often stamp marked on the cylinder shoulder. It's almost always expressed as a volume in litres, but sometimes as mass of the water in kg. Fresh water has a density close to one kilogram per litre so the numerical values are effectively identical at one <b>decimal</b> <b>place</b> accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Three of {{the stable}} {{isotopes}} {{are found in}} three of the four major decay chains: lead-206, lead-207, and lead-208 are the final decay products of uranium-238, uranium-235, and thorium-232, respectively. These decay chains are called the uranium series, the actinium series, and the thorium series. Their isotopic concentration in a natural rock sample depends greatly on the presence of these three parent uranium and thorium isotopes. For example, the relative abundance of lead-208 can range from 52% in normal samples to 90% in thorium ores; for this reason, the standard atomic weight of lead is given to only one <b>decimal</b> <b>place.</b> As time passes, the ratio of lead-206 and lead-207 to lead-204 increases, since the former two are supplemented by radioactive decay of heavier elements while the latter is not; this allows for lead–lead dating. As uranium decays into lead, their relative amounts change; this is the basis for uranium–lead dating.|$|E
5000|$|In his {{numerical}} approximation, he correctly computed 2π (or [...] ) to 9 sexagesimal digits in 1424, and he converted this {{estimate of}} 2π to 16 <b>decimal</b> <b>places</b> of accuracy. This {{was far more}} accurate than the estimates earlier given in Greek mathematics (3 <b>decimal</b> <b>places</b> by Ptolemy, 150 CE), Chinese mathematics (7 <b>decimal</b> <b>places</b> by Zu Chongzhi, 480 Ad) or Indian mathematics (11 <b>decimal</b> <b>places</b> by Madhava of Sangamagrama, c. 1400). The accuracy of al-Kashi's estimate was not surpassed until Ludolph van Ceulen computed 20 <b>decimal</b> <b>places</b> of π 180 years later. Al-Kashi's goal was to compute the circle constant so precisely that the circumference of the largest possible circle (ecliptica) could be computed with highest desirable precision (the diameter of a hair).|$|R

25|$|Informally, non-terminating {{decimals}} {{are easily}} understood, {{because it is}} clear that a real number can be approximated to any required degree of precision by a terminating decimal.

25|$|Rounding {{a number}} twice in {{succession}} to different levels of precision, with the latter precision being coarser, is not guaranteed to give the same result as rounding once to the final precision except {{in the case of}} directed rounding. For instance rounding 9.46 to one decimal gives 9.5, and then 10 when rounding to integer using rounding half to even, but would give 9 when rounded to integer directly. Borman and Chatfield discuss the implications of double rounding when comparing data rounded to one <b>decimal</b> <b>place</b> to specification limits expressed using integers.|$|E

25|$|The {{similarity}} of the Roman abacus to the Chinese one suggests {{that one could}} have inspired the other, as {{there is some evidence}} of a trade relationship between the Roman Empire and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the {{similarity of}} the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and Japanese) has 4 plus 1 bead per <b>decimal</b> <b>place,</b> the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.|$|E

In the 2004 Season 4 DVD commentary for this episode, show runners Mike Reiss and Al Jean reveal that they did not like Carter, although they would vote for him ahead of George W. Bush. Kwik-E-Mart operator Apu testifies in a courtroom scene in the episode that he is able to recite 40,000 decimal places of the number pi. He correctly notes that the 40,000th digit is the number one. The episode's writers prepared for this scene by asking David H.
