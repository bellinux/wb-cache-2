25|$|A small {{attack on}} Arrow Head Copse <b>failed,</b> <b>part</b> of ZZ Trench {{into the village}} from the north was taken and the French {{captured}} Angle Wood. The attack on 21 August failed and the plan for 24 August, was changed late on 22 August. The French would attack from the Somme to Maurepas, the 35th Division would conform but stop short of the German second position and the 20th Division would take the north edge of Guillemont and the south-west of Ginchy. A German artillery bombardment and counter-attack late on 23 August, led to the cancellation of the XIV Corps attack, except {{on the right of}} the 35th Division, the French attack mostly being repulsed. On 25 August, Rawlinson announced a series of divisional reliefs, which delayed the attack to the end of August, when it was arranged that XIV Corps would attack the German second position, from Falfemont Farm to Guillemont. Heavy rain began to fall on 25 August and turned the ground into a swamp, preventing the digging of assembly trenches, blocking routes to the front line and severely slowing the flow of supplies. The bombardment opened in the morning of 29 August and the attack was postponed again to 1 September, then postponed again to 3 September, because of a thunderstorm on 29 August.|$|E
2500|$|By the {{afternoon}} of Friday, September 22, 1905, the sea seemed to have become more tranquil, so Captain Hansen took Harrison {{back out into the}} ocean to make the run to Alsea. [...] Arriving at Alsea, the improved sea conditions led Captain Hansen to decide to take the vessel in. [...] However, in crossing the bar, Harrison struck ground hard, and was driven onto the sand spit {{on the south side of}} the bay entrance, about one-quarter mile from shore.

40|$|We study static repair {{priorities}} {{in a system}} consisting of one repair shop and one stockpoint, where spare parts of multiple repairables are kept on stock to serve an installed base of technical systems. Demands for ready-for-use parts occur according to Poisson processes, and are accom-panied by returns of <b>failed</b> <b>parts.</b> The demands are met from stock if possible, and otherwise they are backordered and fulfilled as soon as possible. Returned <b>failed</b> <b>parts</b> are immediately sent into repair. The repairables are assigned to static priority classes. The repair shop is modelled as a single-server queue, where the <b>failed</b> <b>parts</b> are served according to these priority classes. We show that under a given assignment of repairables to priority classes, optimal circulation stock levels follow from Newsboy-type equations. Next, we develop fast and effective heuristics for the assignment of repairables to priority classes. Subsequently, we compare {{the performance of the}} system under these static priorities to the case with a First-Come First-Served (FCFS) service discipline. We show that in many cases static priorities reduce total inventory holding and back-ordering costs by more than 40 %. Finally, we analyse the effect of the number of priority classes. We show that 2 priority classes suffice to obtain 90 % of the maximal savings via static priorities...|$|R
50|$|Another cost {{advantage}} with rotational molding is the minimal {{amount of material}} wasted in production. There are no sprues or runners (as in injection molding), no off-cuts (thermoforming), or pinch off scrap (blow molding). What material is wasted, through scrap or <b>failed</b> <b>part</b> testing, can usually be recycled.|$|E
50|$|The {{facility}} was opened in April, 1967. However, within {{several months of}} being commissioned the azimuth bearing of the antenna suffered a catastrophic failure. GEC were contracted to repair the bearing and devised a system to replace the <b>failed</b> <b>part</b> while leaving the 400 tonne dish ostensibly in-place.|$|E
50|$|Because of this {{sensitivity}} to logistics, militaries {{have sought to}} make their logistics operations as effective as possible, focusing effort on operations research and optimal maintenance. Maintenance has been simplified {{by the introduction of}} interchangeable modules known as line-replaceable units (LRUs). LRUs make it possible to quickly replace an unserviceable (<b>failed)</b> <b>part</b> with a serviceable (working) replacement. This makes it relatively straightforward to repair complex military hardware, at the expense of having a ready supply of spare parts.|$|E

50|$|Cooper's {{flight was}} delayed for 24 hours {{due to a}} {{malfunction}} in the Bermuda FPS-16 radar's antenna data system. The radar set failed a CADFISS test, where all the stations in the network had to transmit information to NASA to ensure accurate information could be obtained. The <b>failed</b> <b>part</b> was replaced within 3 hours, but when the Capsule communicator asked for a realistic estimate, he was told 24 hours. The mission was immediately scrubbed for one day.|$|E
50|$|At most institutions, {{the system}} allows {{a small amount}} of discretion. A {{candidate}} may be elevated to the next degree class if his or her average marks are close to (or the median of their weighted marks achieves) the higher class, and if they have submitted several pieces of work worthy of the higher class. However, even students with a high average mark may be unable to take honours if they have <b>failed</b> <b>part</b> of the course and so have insufficient credits.|$|E
5000|$|Economically, {{there is}} a {{tradeoff}} between the cost of ordering a replacement part {{and the cost of}} repairing a <b>failed</b> <b>part.</b> When the cost of repair becomes a significant percentage of the cost of replacement, it becomes economically favorable to simply order a replacement part. In such cases, the part is said to be [...] "beyond economic repair" [...] (BER), and the percentage associated with this threshold is known as the BER rate. Analysis of economic tradeoffs is formally evaluated using Level of Repair Analysis (LORA).|$|E

50|$|Analysis of a <b>failed</b> <b>part</b> {{can be done}} using {{destructive}} testing or non-{{destructive testing}}. Destructive testing involves removing a metal component from service and sectioning the component for analysis. Destructive testing gives the failure analyst the ability to conduct the analysis in a laboratory setting and perform tests on the material that will ultimately destroy the component. Non destructive testing is a test method that allows certain physical properties of metal to be examined without taking the samples completely out of service. NDT is generally used to detect failures in components before the component fails catastrophically.|$|E

5000|$|Tandem's {{products}} for this market {{began with the}} Integrity line in 1989, using MIPS processors and a [...] "NonStop UX" [...] variant of Unix. It was developed in Austin TX.

[...] Some other version of Integrity used 4x [...] "pair and spares" [...] redundancy. Pairs of processors ran in lock-step to check each other. When they disagreed, both processors were marked untrusted and their workload {{was taken over by}} a hot-spare pair of processors whose state was already current. In 1995, the Integrity S4000 was the first to use ServerNet and moved toward sharing peripherals with the NonStop line.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{research}} {{involves the}} combination of spare parts management and reverse logistics. At {{the end of the}} product life cycle, products in the field (so called installed base) can usually be serviced by either new parts, obtained from a Last Time Buy, or by repaired <b>failed</b> <b>parts.</b> This paper, however, introduces a third source: the phase-out returns obtained from customers that replace systems. These returned parts may serve other customers that do not replace the systems yet. Phase-out return flows represent higher volumes and higher repair yields than <b>failed</b> <b>parts</b> and are cheaper to get than new ones. This new phenomenon has been ignored in the literature thus far, but due to increased product replacements rates its relevance will grow. We present a generic model, applied in a case study with real-life data from ConRepair, a third-party service provider in plant control systems (mainframes). Volumes of demand for spares, defects returns and phase-out returns are interrelated, because the same installed base is involved. In contrast with the existing literature, this paper explicitly models the operational control of both failed- and phase-out returns, which proves far from trivial given the nonstationary nature of the problem. We have to consider subintervals within the total planning interval to optimize both Last Time Buy and control policies well. Given the novelty of the problem, we limit ourselves to a single customer, single-item approach...|$|R
