Releases were done at three distances; either at 5 m from one trap, or at 50 or 200 m from five traps, placed in a line perpendicular to the current wind direction.

A total of 1729 males were released, and 80 % of them took flight. Males took off significantly faster {{in the presence of}} pheromone. Grooming was significantly more frequent in presence of pheromone compared with control. In all pheromone experiments significantly more males displayed grooming, wing fanning and take-off towards the wind compared with the control. Weather data was simultaneously collected at the study site. Wing fanning was negatively correlated with wind speed. Grooming was not influenced by wind speed.

40|$|Abstract: The <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffr.) (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae), is {{a serious}} pest of pine {{plantations}} and ornamentals. Chemical pesticides used to control this pest have a detrimental effect on the environment. The Neodiprion sertifer nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NsNPV) frequently causes considerable decreases in the populations but doses not harm other animals or plants. In this study, we tested five different concentrations of NsNPV against the larvae of N. sertifer and showed viral infection using Giemsa staining. When a viral concentration of 5 x 109 PIB/ml (Polyhedral Inclusion Body) was utilized, larval mortality started {{on the fourth day}} and reached 90. 4 % on the ninth day of the bioassay. However, lower viral concentrations, 5 x 109, 5 x 108 and 5 x 107 PIB/ml, showed the same mortality, but the infection periods occurred on different days. This study shows that NsNPV can be effectively used against N. sertifer as a safe biological control agent in Turkey...|$|E

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Neodiprion sertifer (Geoffroy) (Hymenoptera: Diprionidae), is a {{widespread}} and economically important forest insect. The sex pheromone communication system of this species has been previously investigated in North America, Japan and Europe, with the acetate or propionate of the alcohol (2 S, 3 S, 7 S) - 3, 7 -dimethyl- 2 -pentadecanol (diprionol) shown {{to be the main}} pheromone component. In some locations, male attraction either increased or decreased by the addition of the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -diprionyl acetate isomer. However, these studies were made with different batches of synthetic pheromones, with different types of traps and according to different procedures, so the observed differences might not reflect true geographic variation. Here we investigate the geographic pattern of male sawfly response by using identical chemicals, traps and experimental procedures at eight field sites ranging from Japan in the east to Canada in the west. We found an increased inhibitory effect of the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -isomer from Japan and Siberia to Europe. At the eastern sites, increasing amounts of the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -isomer up to and equal to the amount of the (2 S, 3 S, 7 S) -isomer, did not influence the trap catch, whereas at sites in Europe, as little as 1 % of the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -isomer almost completely inhibited the attraction. The response of the North American population was intermediate. The only site in which the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -isomer was essential for the attraction of males was in Siberia. A similar pattern was found for the (2 S, 3 R, 7 S) -isomer. Both the acetate and the propionate form of the (2 S, 3 S, 7 S) -isomer were attractive by themselves in Japan, Europe and North America, and neither the (2 S, 3 R, 7 S) -isomer nor the (2 S, 3 R, 7 R) -isomer alone were attractive, in the acetate or propionate form.

40|$|Evidence for cross-induction of {{systemic}} resistance or susceptibility in plant–fungus–herbivore interactions is mostly derived from herbaceous model systems and not perennial woody plants.

40|$|Abstract. Knowledge about {{large-scale}} {{and long-term}} dynamics of (natural) populations {{is required to}} assess the efficiency of control strategies, the potential for long-term persistence, and the adaptability to global changes such as habitat fragmentation and global warming. For most natural populations, such as pest populations, large-scale and long-term surveys cannot be carried out at a high resolution. For instance, for population dynamics characterised by irregular abundance explosions, i. e. outbreaks, {{it is common to}} report detected outbreaks rather than measuring the population density at every location and time event. Here, we propose a mechanical-statistical model for analysing such outbreak occurrence data and making inference about population dynamics. This spatio-temporal model contains the main mechanisms of the dynamics and describes the observation process. This construction enables us to account for the discrepancy between the phenomenon scale and the sampling scale. We propose the Bayesian method to estimate model parameters, pest densities and hidden factors, i. e. variables involved in the dynamics but not observed. The model was specified and used to learn about the dynamics of the <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Neodiprion sertifer Geoffr., an insect causing major defoliation of pines in northern Europe) based on Finnish sawfly data covering the years 1961 – 1990.

40|$|The <b>European</b> <b>Pine</b> <b>Sawfly</b> (Neodiprion sertifer) {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{defoliators}} of Scots pine in northern Europe. We studied the pattern in the regional occurrence of the outbreaks of N. sertifer in Finland in years 1961 – 90, and made predictions about the outbreak pattern to the year 2050 after predicted winter warming. We tested whether minimum winter temperatures and forest type and soil properties could explain the observed outbreak pattern. We analysed outbreak patterns at two different spatial levels: forest board- and municipal-level. The proportion of coniferous forests on damage susceptible soils (dry and infertile sites) explained a significant part of the variation in outbreak frequency at small spatial scale (municipalities) but not at large spatial scale (forest boards). At the forest board level the incidence of minimum temperatures below – 36 °C (= the critical value for egg mortality) explains 33 % of the variation in the outbreak pattern, and at the municipal level the incidence of cold winters was also the most significant explaining variable in northern Finland. Egg mortality due to cold winters seems to be the most parsimonious factor explaining why there have been so few N. sertifer outbreaks in northern and northeastern Finland. We predict that climate change (increased winter temperatures) may increase the frequency of outbreaks in eastern and northern Finland in the future. Part I Climate Chang...|$|E

Males were released 5 m downwind from one trap, or downwind from five traps, 50 m or 200 m away. The average capture rates after 24 hr were 21. 5 %, 17. 7 % and 3. 8 %, respectively. The capture rate was highest at moderate wind speeds (1 - 2 m/sec) in the 50 m experiments, whereas it decreased above wind speeds of 1. 5 m/sec in the 200 m experiments. With no precipitation and > 13. 5 degreesC during overcast, wind speed is presumably the most important climatic factor for N. sertifer males flying upwind to a pheromone source. Travel time, the elapsed time form take-off to landing on the trap, varied considerably, and the shortest recorded travel times were 1, 6 and 45 min for the 5, 50, and 200 m experiments, respectively. The trap efficiency i. e., number of captured males per number of males that landed on the trap, was estimated at 52 % in the 5 m experiments.

40|$|Population {{densities of}} forest defoliating insects may be {{regulated}} by small mammal predation on the pupae. When outbreaks do occur, they often coincide with warm, dry weather and at barren forest sites. A proposed {{reason for this}} is that weather and habitat affect small mammal population density (numerical response) and hence pupal predation. We propose an alternative explanation: weather and habitat affect small mammal feeding behaviour (functional response) and hence the outbreak risks of forest pest insects. We report results from laboratory and field-enclosure experiments estimating rates of pupal predation by bank voles (Myodes glareolus) on an outbreak insect, the <b>European</b> <b>pine</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Neodiprion sertifer), at different temperatures (15 and 20 A degrees C), in different microhabitats (sheltered and non-sheltered), and with or without access to alternative food (sunflower seeds). We found that the probability of a single pupa being eaten at 20 A degrees C was lower than at 15 A degrees C (0. 49 and 0. 72, respectively). Pupal predation was higher in the sheltered microhabitat than in the open one, and the behaviour of the voles differed between microhabitats. More pupae were eaten in situ in the sheltered microhabitat whereas in the open area more pupae were removed and eaten elsewhere. Access to alternative food did not affect pupal predation. The results suggest that predation rates on pine sawfly pupae by voles are influenced by temperature- and habitat-induced variation in the physiology and behaviour of the predator, and not necessarily solely through effects on predator densities as previously proposed...|$|E
