500|$|Yoshizawa placed greater {{emphasis}} on story {{as opposed to the}} arcade version, and he wrote and designed the plot that included over 20 minutes of cinematic cutscenes – the first time an NES game contained such sequences. Tecmo called the cutscene system [...] "Tecmo Theater", in which the game reveals the storyline between Acts through the usage of animated sequences. These sequences are used {{at the beginning of each}} Act to introduce new characters such as Irene Lew, Walter Smith, and the Jaquio. This feature uses techniques such as close-ups, alternate camera angles, differing background music, and sound effects. It was used to make the game more enjoyable for players. Unlike earlier titles such as Final Fantasy, the cutscenes consisted of large anime art on the top half of the screen with dialogue on the bottom half. This made the artistic style more reminiscent of other manga titles such as LupinIII and Golgo13. Dimitri Criona, TecmoUSA's <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>sales</b> and marketing, said that the advantages of console games over arcade games allowed the creation of a longer game and the inclusion of cutscenes, which Tecmo trademarked as [...] "cinema screens"; he noted the lack of motivation to drop quarters that has allowed this on home consoles, which required a different reward structure than in arcade games. The game contains a feature that was originally a glitch but left in the final game intentionally, according to Masato Kato. When losing to any of the final three bosses in the game, the player is sent back to the beginning of the sixth act.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the boom}} years of World War I, Baldwin's {{business}} would decline as the Great Depression gripped the country and diesel engines became the growth market on American railways {{at the end of}} the 1930s. During the 1920s the major locomotive manufacturers had strong incentives to maintain the dominance of the steam engine. Nevertheless, ALCO, while remaining committed to steam production, pursued R strategies in the 1920s and '30s that would ensure its competitiveness in the event that diesel locomotives would predominate. In contrast, Baldwin in the 1930s discounted the possibility that diesel could replace steam. In 1930 Samuel Vauclain, Chairman of the Board, stated in a speech that advances in steam technology would ensure the dominance of the steam engine until at least 1980. Baldwin’s Vice President and <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Sales</b> stated in December 1937 that [...] "Some time in the future, when all this is reviewed, it will be found that our railroads are no more dieselized than they electrified". Baldwin had deep roots in the steam locomotive industry, and may have been influenced by heavy investment in its Eddystone plant.|$|E
