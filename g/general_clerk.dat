40|$|Graduation date: 1985 The Purpose of the Study: The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to compare the {{clerical}} office occupations teachers' and business employers' perceptions of the competencies important for a high school graduate to possess for an entry-level clerical office job in Oregon. A secondary purpose was to determine the best instructional strategy for preparing a high school student enrolled in clerical office occupations program. The major objectives were to compare (1) the teachers' and employers' responses, (2) small and large business employers' responses, and (3) the responses from rural and urban counties. Procedures: A mail questionnaire containing ten demographic items and 153 competencies was used to collect the data. The F statistic with the critical value set at. 05 was used to compute the analysis of variance. Chi-Square was used to test the hypothesis that the teachers' and employers' responses were independent of each other. Selected Findings and Conclusions: The five criteria business employers consider when hiring beginning clerical office workers were (1) personal interview, (2) attitude, (3) personal appearance, (4) cooperative work experience, and (5) personality. The five clerical office occupations for which business employers in Oregon most frequently hire high school graduates without prior full-time work experience were (1) <b>general</b> <b>clerk,</b> (2) clerk typist, (3) receptionist, (4) mail clerk, and (5) switchboard operator. The top five clerical office occupations employers in Oregon anticipated will be in the greatest demand in five years included: <b>general</b> <b>clerk,</b> clerk typist, receptionist, word processor, and general bookkeeping. Although the teachers and employers in the sample basically agreed on the competencies important for an entry-level clerical office job, they statistically disagreed on the extent of importance. The small urban business employers rated the record-keeping competencies at a higher level of importance than the others in the group. There was no statiscally significant rural or urban effect in the teachers' and employers' responses. The two groups had different opinions concerning the instructional strategy for individual competencies. The teachers and employers favored a combination of formal course work and cooperative work experience as the best instructional strategy for preparing a student enrolled in the clerical office occupations program...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to analyze the available pesticide poisoning data in Oregon from 1994 to 1998 in order to obtain a descriptive account of general incident information and of occupational exposures. These data were to be used by the Pesticide Analytical and Response Center for planning preventive strategies to reduce pesticide poisonings. Specific data from the five-year period were retrieved from two different software systems, dBaseIV and SPIDER, a National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health Institute program. They were then reconciled to each other, and analyzed with SPSS Version 10 for frequency information. Percentages from frequencies, and in some cases, population-based rates, were then calculated. Results indicated that the population usually affected by pesticides each year was non-Hispanic, female, and 40 to 49 years old. More pesticide poisonings took place in non-occupational settings than occupational settings for the five-year period as a whole. However, when reviewing each year, there were more occupational cases than non-occupational cases in 1994, 1996, and 1998. Marion and Multnomah counties experienced a higher number of poisonings than other counties. However, when rates per 100, 000 people were calculated, Wheeler and Wasco, which are both rural, were the top two ranking counties, with rates of 12. 7 and 4. 4 respectively. Organophosphate insecticides were involved in poisonings more than other pesticides, with chlorpyrifos as the active ingredient most frequently seen for the five-year period. The target organs more frequently affected were those of the central nervous system, followed by the gastrointestinal system. Occupational incidence information showed that the top three occupations with greater frequencies of pesticide poisonings were <b>general</b> <b>clerk,</b> registered nurse, and farm worker. It was determined that all occupations were potentially at some risk of pesticide poisoning. Some occupations had work tasks that provided more exposure to pesticides and could be classified as high-risk, such as farm workers. Other typically low-risk occupations, such as nurses and general clerks, were exposed to pesticides from patients who were poisoning victims or exposed to unacceptable levels of residue as a result of structural spraying. Non-Hispanics were shown to have experienced the majority of pesticide poisonings for the five-year period, with almost 62...|$|E
