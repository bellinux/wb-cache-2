25|$|In {{the fiscal}} year 2004 and over most of {{the fiscal year}} 2005, the pound depreciated against the US dollar. Since {{the second half of the}} fiscal year 2006 until the end of the fiscal year 2007, the pound {{gradually}} appreciated to EGP 5.69 per USD. While it was likely to continue appreciating in the short-term, given the skyrocketing oil prices and the weakening US economy, the advent of the global economic crisis of 2008, and resulting behavior of foreign investors exiting from the stock market in Egypt increased the dollar exchange rate against the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>pound,</b> which rose by more than 4% since Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy. As the demand pressure from exiting foreign investors eases, the dollar exchange rate against the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>pound</b> is expected to decline. It stands at EGP 7.00 per USD as of 18 June 2013. Due to the rising power of the US dollar, as of January 2015 one dollar equals 7.83 Egyptian pounds.|$|E

2500|$|Alexandria's dialect (west Delta) {{is noted}} for certain shibboleths {{separating}} its speech {{from that of}} Cairo (south Delta). The ones most frequently commented on in popular discourse are {{the use of the}} word falafel as opposed to ṭa`meyya for the fava-bean fritters common across the country, and the pronunciation of the word for the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>pound</b> as , rather than the Cairene [...] (closer to the pronunciation of the origin of the term, the British guinea).

The name also forms the basis for the Arabic word for the <b>Egyptian</b> <b>pound</b> الجنيه [...] , as a sum of 100 qirsh (one pound) was worth approximately 21 shillings {{at the end of the}} 19th century.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2014, {{conspiracy}} to kill charges were dismissed by the Cairo Criminal Court on a technicality. The court also cleared Mubarak of corruption charges. [...] On 13 January 2015, Egypt's Court of Cassation overturned Mubarak's and his sons' embezzlement charges, {{the last remaining}} conviction against him, and ordered a retrial. A retrial on the corruption charges led to a conviction and sentencing {{to three years in}} prison in May 2015 for Mubarak, with four-year terms for his sons, Gamal and Alaa. It was not immediately clear whether the sentence would take into account time already served – Mubarak and his sons have already spent more than three years in prison, so potentially will not have to serve any additional time. Supporters of Mubarak jeered the decision when it was announced in a Cairo courtroom on 9 May. [...] The sentence also included a 125 million <b>Egyptian</b> <b>pound</b> (US$16.3 million) fine, and required the return of 21 million embezzled Egyptian pounds (US$2.7 million).
