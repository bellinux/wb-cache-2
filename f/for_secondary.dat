5|$|Holmboe's {{significant}} impact on mathematics in the fledgling Norway was his textbook in two volumes <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> schools.

5|$|In October 1963, {{three young}} boys {{turned up at}} a senior {{athletics}} meet in Geelong, Victoria.

A few months later, Billingham held a coaching camp <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> school students. His camp had a lot of primary school students in attendance.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the honeybee. This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico. Other introductions include 18 species of ant, {{one of the most}} abundant taxa in leaf litter habitats.|$|E

5|$|Arcona {{served in}} all three German navies {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. She served both with the fleet and abroad during her career in the Imperial Navy in the early 1900s. In World War I, she was used as a coastal defense ship and then as a support vessel for the U-boat {{campaign}} in the Atlantic. After the war, she served briefly in the Reichsmarine before being withdrawn and used <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> duties. After the German Navy became the Kriegsmarine in 1935, it rebuilt Arcona as a floating anti-aircraft battery and used her to defend several German ports during World War II. She was scuttled in the final days of the war, and broken up for scrap in 19481949.|$|E
5|$|At any time, {{there are}} four or five people working at the control center: two monitor the ATC system, one {{monitors}} passenger information, and one is responsible <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> systems, such as power supply.

5|$|At the university, Holmboe again met Christopher Hansteen, who {{had become}} a {{professor}} there in 1816. In 1835, Hansteen published his own mathematics textbook <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> schools. A reaction to Holmboe's books and method of teaching, it was more practically oriented. Holmboe wrote {{a review of the}} book for the newspaper Morgenbladet, in which he advised schools not to use it. A public debate followed, with contributions from other mathematicians. It has been claimed that this was the first debate on the subject of school textbooks in Norway. Hansteen's textbook was not reprinted.|$|E
5|$|Both ships served {{abroad for}} the {{majority}} of their careers, primarily in Germany's African colonies and in Asia and the Pacific. Their service lives were generally uneventful, apart from the normal routine of colonial policing. They were both sent to German East Africa to help put down the Abushiri Revolt in 188990, and Schwalbe joined the Eight Nation Alliance against the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1900. Both ships were decommissioned by 1911 and were thereafter used <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> roles: Schwalbe as a training ship and Sperber as a target ship. After World War I, both vessels were sold and broken up for scrap by 1922.|$|E
5|$|For {{safety and}} water quality reasons, the lake has {{different}} zones for different activities. The eastern extremity is zoned for primary contact water activities such as swimming and water skiing. The East and Central Basins, closer to populated areas, are zoned <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> contact water sports such as sailing or rowing. West Lake and Tarcoola Reach, which covers the area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point, is the primary recreational area of the lake, and both primary and secondary contact water sports are permitted. Yarramundi Reach near Scrivener Dam has a marked rowing course, and is zoned as secondary, although primary contact activities are also allowed.|$|E

5|$|Frequent {{and often}} {{contradictory}} directives were issued by Reich Minister of the Interior Wilhelm Frick, Bernhard Rust of the Reichserziehungsministerium (Ministry of Education) {{and various other}} agencies regarding content of lessons and acceptable textbooks for use in primary and secondary schools. Books deemed unacceptable to the regime were removed from school libraries. Indoctrination in National Socialist thought was made compulsory in January 1934. Students selected as future members of the party elite were indoctrinated {{from the age of}} 12 at Adolf Hitler Schools for primary education and National Political Institutes of Education <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> education. Detailed National Socialist indoctrination of future holders of elite military rank was undertaken at Order Castles.|$|E
5|$|Gil {{was born}} in Salvador, an {{industrial}} city in the northeast of Brazil, though {{he spent much of}} his childhood in nearby Ituaçu.

5|$|Prinzess Wilhelm {{returned}} to Germany in 1899 and was modernized in 1899–1903. Irene followed her sister back to Germany in 1901, and was similarly modified in 1903–1905. Both ships remained in service until early 1914, {{when they were}} retired from front-line service and used <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> duties. Irene was converted into a submarine tender. She served in this capacity until 1921, when she was sold for scrap and broken up the following year. Prinzess Wilhelm {{was reduced to a}} mine hulk in February 1914 and ultimately broken up for scrap in 1922.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} repairs are the {{grinding}} of the wheels; more complicated repairs {{are made by}} replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer. By having components in reserve, trains can have shorter maintenance times. The center also has the system's work trains, including a diesel locomotive that can fetch broken trains. At any time, there are four people working at the control center.

5|$|The six Siegfried class {{ships were}} used in fleet {{maneuvers}} throughout the 1890s, until they were reconstructed {{at the end of}} the decade. The modernization included re-boilering and lengthening, both of which improved the ships' speed. They were mobilized at the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, but remained on active service for only a year; in August 1915, they were withdrawn and used <b>for</b> <b>secondary</b> roles, primarily as barracks ships. All of the ships, save , were scrapped after the end of the war. Frithjof was converted into a merchant ship instead, and operated until 1930, when she too was broken up for scrap.|$|E
