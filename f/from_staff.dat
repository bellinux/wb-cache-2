5|$|Matsuno, the game's {{producer}} and director, preferred {{to create a}} new game title from scratch and use design ideas <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> collaborations, rather than reusing popular characters and designs that are found in sequels. Vagrant Story is regarded as a mixture of genres, as it contains elements of role-playing in its battles and platform games when in the field map. Matsuno explained that the development team was not eager to place Vagrant Story into a specific genre, preferring to create the game with a genre of its own.|$|E
5|$|As the {{visibility}} of LGBT comic book creators and characters has increased, comic book fandom has taken notice. Panels discussing LGBT topics occur regularly at comic book and LGBT conventions such as Comicon and Gaylaxicon, and conventions also feature stands dedicated to LGBT comics. Ted Abenheim, event chair of Prism Comics said in 2008, “We’re in our sixth year of exhibiting at Comic-Con, presenting a larger booth and more panels and events than ever before.” A number of websites dedicated to LGBT comic book fandom and featuring content <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> writers exist, such as Prismcomics.org, Pinkkrytonite.com and Gayleague.com.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of L.A. Noire began in 2004 following {{the founding of}} its developer Team Bondi. Rockstar Games published L.A. Noire on 17 May 2011 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 8 November 2011 for Microsoft Windows; a re-release for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One is scheduled for 14 November 2017. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, the work was shared between the core team and multiple Rockstar studios around the world. L.A. Noire was delayed numerous times through its seven-year development, which included a change of publisher and platforms. The working hours and managerial style of the studio during development was met with public complaints <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> members. L.A. Noire was formally announced in 2005; it was heavily promoted through video trailers and press demonstrations.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of Red Dead Redemption began in 2005. Rockstar Games published Red Dead Redemption on May 18, 2010 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. One of their studios, Rockstar San Diego, oversaw the work, {{sharing it with}} other studios around the world. The development team considered the game a spiritual successor to Red Dead Revolver. Red Dead Redemption was delayed numerous times through its four-year development, often attributed to technological problems. The working hours and managerial style of the studio during development was met with public complaints <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> members. Red Dead Redemption was officially announced in 2009; it was heavily promoted and widely anticipated.|$|E
5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions that it would be better to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E
5|$|On {{designing}} the battle system, Kitao {{said that his}} two main aims were creating something never before seen in an RPG and designing something accessible yet challenging. Adjustments to the battle system went on all through development, with some changes being made {{at the very last}} minute. The gun customization system was originally a puzzle-based system, but was later converted to a diagram set-up. Weapons were originally going to be represented in three-dimensions, but technical issues prevented this. On the whole, the development was a taxing one for him. The most difficult part about incorporating guns into the system was creating a workable system that did not rely on first-person and third-person shooter mechanics. The two types of damage and various special moves in the game were born from the team's discussions about how the three playable characters might be directed to work in unison, dealing different types of attacks. Being able to attack while moving was inspired by a suggestion <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> members stemming from more traditional action games and scenes from Hollywood action films. For the camera, the team decided to balance it between limited control during player turns and a more dynamic feel during attacks.|$|E

40|$|Many {{rostering}} methods first create shifts <b>from</b> some given <b>staffing</b> levels, {{and after}} that create rosters from the set of created shifts. Although such a method has some nice properties, it also has some bad ones. In this paper we outline a method that creates rosters directly <b>from</b> <b>staffing</b> levels. We use a Branch-and-Price (B&P) method to solve this rostering problem and compare it to an ILP formulation of the subclass of rostering problems studied in this paper. The two methods perform almost equally well. Branch-and-Price, though, {{turns out to be}} a far more flexible approach to solve rostering problems. It is not too hard to extend the Branch-and-Price model with extra rostering constraints. However, for ILP this is much harder, if not impossible. Next to this, the Branch-and-Price method is more open to improvements and hence, combined with the larger flexibility, we consider it better suited to create rosters directly <b>from</b> <b>staffing</b> levels in practice...|$|R
5|$|The {{syndicated}} version's potential contestants, {{depending on}} tryouts, {{are required to}} pass an electronically scored test comprising a set of thirty questions which must be answered within a 10-minute time limit. Contestants who fail the test are eliminated, while those who pass are interviewed for an audition by the production staff, and those who impress the staff the most are then notified by postal mail {{that they have been}} placed into a pool for possible selection as contestants. At the producers' discretion, contestants from said pool are selected to appear on actual episodes of the syndicated program; these contestants are given a phone call <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> and asked to confirm the information on their initial application form and verify that they meet all eligibility requirements. Afterwards, they are given a date to travel to the show's taping facilities to participate in a scheduled episode of the show. Unlike its ABC counterpart, the syndicated version does not offer transportation or hotel accommodations to contestants at the production company's expense; that version's contestants are instead required to provide transportation and accommodations of their own.|$|E
5|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} on 4 August 1914, Gellibrand offered his {{services}} to the commandant of the 6th Military District (Tasmania). On 20 August 1914, he {{was appointed to the}} Australian Imperial Force (AIF) as a captain, and given the post of Deputy Assistant Quartermaster General (DAQMG) {{on the staff of the}} 1st Division. Staff college graduates like Gellibrand were scarce in Australia; only six Australian Army officers had graduated <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> colleges. There were also four of the British Army's graduates on secondment. For the 1st Division's General Staff (G) Branch, the division commander, Major General William Bridges, chose two of Gellibrand's Camberley classmates, Lieutenant Colonel Brudenell White from the Australian Army, and Major Duncan Glasfurd from the British Army, and Captain Thomas Blamey, an Australian Army officer who had graduated from the Staff College, Quetta. The Administration (A) Branch was headed by the AA & QMG, Colonel Victor Sellheim. Lieutenant Colonel W. G. Patterson was his deputy, the DAA & QMG. As DAQMG, Gellibrand was responsible for logistics; Major Cecil Foott, an Australian 1913 Camberley graduate, was the Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG), responsible for personnel matters. On 23 September 1914 Gellibrand was promoted to major, the usual rank for his post.|$|E
5|$|While Final Fantasy XIII was in production, the {{development}} of Crystal Tools caused significant problems and delays. The programmers spent much time on taking all demands <b>from</b> <b>staff</b> into account. Based on this feedback, Murata's team tried to adapt the engine {{to the needs of}} several game projects, which proved to be virtually impossible and prevented the engine's specifications from being finalized. Furthermore, as separate groups were working on the individual tools of the engine, there was no comprehensive software documentation to ensure usability and compliance. Unable to wait any longer, the Final Fantasy XIII team {{had no choice but to}} begin creating assets to keep to the game's production schedule. However, the lack of specifications resulted in these assets being incompatible with the engine. In the end, it was decided that Final Fantasy XIII was to be the principal focus of Crystal Tools and the game's team began cooperating with the Research and Development Division more closely to receive the required tools and specifications. While preliminary support of Crystal Tools was developed for the Wii, the console did not fully support all components. In 2008, Murata said that Square Enix might license the engine out to other companies at some point in the future, although the limited documentation and the impracticality of supporting licensees posed great problems in doing so. Two years later, Final Fantasy XIII producer Yoshinori Kitase stated that developing an engine from scratch to go with a new game may have been a mistake and a likely cause for the long period between the title's announcement and release.|$|E
