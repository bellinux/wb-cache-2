5|$|The Master and Mistress take Lad {{on their}} annual fall camping {{trip to the}} {{mountains}} for two weeks. During the trip, Lad playfully teases a bear, leading to a fight, which the master ends by scaring off the bear. At {{the end of the}} trip, Lad is accidentally left tied to a tree at the camp site. While his owners are returning to find their missing dog, Lad is trapped by a forest fire. When the bear he fought earlier rushes past with singed fur, Lad chews through his rope and follows the other animals of the forest to sit in a nearby lake. When his owners arrive, he runs through the burning fire to join them, blistering <b>his</b> <b>paws</b> on some coals.|$|E
5|$|As many {{as eight}} males will be at a mating site, staying in close {{vicinity}} to the receptive female. The female seems to choose the male she mates with, and the males compete {{for the attention of}} the female with a significant amount of vocalization and antagonistic interactions. The female may choose to mate with several of the males, and her choice of mate {{does not seem to have}} any correlation to the physical appearance of the males. To stimulate the male to mount her, she gives a series of mewling vocalizations. The male mounts from behind, resting his body on her slightly off-center, a position requiring delicate balance; if the female were to stand, the male would have significant difficulty continuing. He places <b>his</b> <b>paws</b> on her shoulders or grasps her around the waist and often licks her neck. Mating may last for nearly three hours. This unusually lengthy mating is due to the physical nature of the male's erect penis, which has backwards-pointing spines along most of its length. Fossa mating includes a copulatory tie, which may be enforced by the male's spiny penis. The tie is difficult to break if the mating session is interrupted. Copulation with a single male may be repeated several times, with a total mating time of up to fourteen hours, while the male may remain with the female for up to an hour after the mating. A single female may occupy the tree for up to a week, mating with multiple males over that time. Also, other females may take her place, mating with some of the same males as well as others. This mating strategy, whereby the females monopolize a site and maximize the available number of mates, seems to be unique among carnivores. Recent research suggests that this system helps the fossa overcome factors which would normally impede mate-finding, such as low population density and lack of den use.|$|E
25|$|Jaypaw {{is upset}} that he can't compete, and while staying behind at the camp, {{he has a}} vision. He is choking on earth, and he smells badger and fox. He is scrabbling desperately with <b>his</b> <b>paws,</b> until realizes that he is seeing through Lionpaw's eyes. It turns out that, while competing, Lionpaw and Breezepaw fell into a {{collapsing}} fox den. Luckily, Jaypaw got there in time to save them along with Crowfeather. The leaders decide that since every Clan won at something, {{there would be a}} tie and no Clan would win.|$|E

25|$|From 1883 {{the school}} was {{accustomed}} {{to use as a}} coat of arms the version of the Wilson shield used by Edward Wilson, probably without authority. In 1985 the then Chairman of Governors, Lt. Col. W. R. Bowden, obtained a Grant of Arms from the College of Arms. The new officially authorised Arms introduced to the previous form a silver bar between the wolf and the objects above, together with a gold border. Additionally, a crest is added above the helm {{in the form of a}} black wolf holding a silver fleur-de-lys in <b>his</b> <b>paws</b> with a black and gold mantle.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Wiarton Willie {{lived to}} the advanced age of 22, {{and was found}} dead only two days before Groundhog Day in 1999. The organizers were {{unable to find a}} replacement, and instead marked Groundhog Day by revealing [...] "Willie" [...] in a coffin. He had been dressed in a tuxedo, had coins over his eyes, and a carrot between <b>his</b> <b>paws.</b> The real Willie had in fact decomposed, and the body in the coffin was that of an older, stuffed groundhog. The Associated Press was obliged to issue a retraction on its wires.|$|E
2500|$|The regimental {{coat of arms}} was {{approved}} on 10 November 1924 and its distinctive unit insignia {{was approved}} on 8 January 1925. The distinctive unit insignia consisted of a standing grizzly bear holding a garland of oak leaves and acorns tied with a ribbon in <b>his</b> <b>paws</b> over a gold background. The regimental motto, [...] "Tiens ta Foi" [...] (Hold thy Faith) was attached on a ribbon scroll below the insignia. The yellow represented cavalry, the bear was from the Seal of Missouri, and the wreath from the Seal of Arkansas, the two state to which the 321st was allocated. The coat of arms was of a similar design except that it omitted the motto and included the Organized Reserve Minuteman crest above the shield.|$|E
