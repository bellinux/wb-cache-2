5|$|Enrollment dropped {{every year}} since the program's {{inception}} such that, when compounded by dropouts, the program was below half-capacity three years later. UW President Glenn Frank had warned of decreased enrollment in August 1928 and of its consequences for the college. UW College of Letters and Science Dean George Sellery offered support conditional on codified discipline and uniform final exams, which Meiklejohn refused. Sellery later refused to allow transfer students into the college. Meiklejohn wrote letters to Wisconsin high schools in April 1929 that acknowledged the college's stereotypes and welcomed demographic change, but the campaign backfired. He sent an adviser to tour the state and solve {{what he saw as}} a communication issue. The adviser found high school seniors largely interested in vocational training, and that the prospect of traditional college excited students {{to the point where they}} did not consider improvements upon that model. The adviser found students uninterested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Experimental</b> College's prospects.|$|E
5|$|Linda Hopper—a {{native of}} Marietta, Georgia—was {{a member of}} the late 1970s/early 1980s music scene in Athens, Georgia, where she befriended fellow University of Georgia student Michael Stipe in an art design class. Stipe went on to form R.E.M. and Hopper joined him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> music group Tanzplagen along with Stipe's sister, Lynda, and other local musicians. After the group folded, Stipe and Hopper formed Oh-OK, whose line-up later {{included}} Matthew Sweet and David McNair. That project ended in 1984 and Hopper briefly belonged to a Washington, D.C. band named Holiday, who released their only EP in 1987.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experiment}} {{was to determine the}} influence of humic substances, garlic (Allium sativum L.), wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) and walnut (Juglans regia) on growth performance and mortality of broiler chickens. A total of 60 Ross 308 broiler chickens were divided into 3 groups (n= 20). The control group of chickens was fed with complete feed mixtures without any additives. Chickens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>experimental</b> group E 1 were fed a diet containing 1. 5 % of humic substances, 0. 4 % of garlic powder and 0. 1 % of wormwood. Chickens <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>experimental</b> group E 2 were fed a diet containing 1. 5 % of humic substances, 0. 4 % of garlic powder and 0. 1 % of walnut. The body weight, feed intake, feed conversion and total mortality were recorded in 42 day of fattening. At the end of the experiment was average body weight significantly higher (P≤ 0. 01) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>experimental</b> group compared to the control group (values <b>in</b> <b>the</b> order of the groups: 1801. 04 ± 166. 25; 1928. 26 ± 226. 37 and 1850. 24 g±SD). The feed intake was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control group 3. 59 kg per chicken, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>experimental</b> group E 1 3. 58 kg per chicken and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>experimental</b> group E 2 3. 45 kg per chicken. Feed conversion was in control group 1. 95 kg, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first <b>experimental</b> group E 1 1. 87 kg and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> second <b>experimental</b> group E 2 1. 84 kg with no significant different (P≥ 0. 05) compared to the control group.

5|$|Murphy {{developed}} his eponymous anastomotic button for a sutureless anastomosis of the gallbladder to the duodenum (his preferred treatment for acute cholecystitis), {{but it was}} equally suitable for intestinal anastomoses. He developed it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> animal laboratory in a barn behind his house and first used it {{less than a week}} after developing it on a dog. The Murphy button can be credited as the forerunner of the modern end-to-end stapling instrument after having become the method of choice for operations at the Mayo Clinic and elsewhere in the United States for over twenty years.|$|E
5|$|The {{pre-production}} Griffon I {{shared the}} R engine's bore and stroke, but was otherwise {{a completely new}} design that first ran <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Experimental</b> Department in November 1939. Although this single engine was never flown, the production version, the Griffon II, first flew in 1941 installed in the Fairey Firefly. A {{significant difference between the}} R and the production Griffon was the re-location of the camshaft and supercharger drives {{to the front of the}} engine to reduce overall length. Another length-reducing measure was the use of a single magneto (the R had two, mounted at the rear), this again was moved to the front of the engine.|$|E
5|$|Quatermass II {{received}} positive newspaper {{reviews in}} the Daily Mail and the Daily Express, although the BBC's Radio Times listings magazine published letters of both praise and criticism for the serial. The serial was also criticised internally at the BBC by Cecil McGivern, who felt {{it to be}} {{not as good as}} the original. One letter received by the production team before the transmission of episode five came from a woman in Haverfordwest who was concerned that she would never find out what happened in the end as the week before the final episode's transmission she was due to move to Ireland {{to spend the rest of}} her life in a convent; she wondered if the BBC could possibly write to her and let her know how the story resolved. After some debate as to whether the letter was a journalistic trick to uncover advance story details, Kneale eventually decided that it was genuine, and allowed Cartier to send a reply outlining the storyline's conclusion. Following episode six, some viewers wrote in to the BBC concerned at Quatermass's survival, as he had not been seen to definitely return to Earth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> rocket ship.|$|E

5|$|Several {{recent studies}} attempt {{to examine the}} effects of chronic low-dose {{manganese}} overexposure on child development. The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240–350µg Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300µg Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400µg Mn/L by the World Health Organization, the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610µg Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160µg Mn/L well. Children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>experimental</b> group showed increased hyperactive and oppositional behavior.|$|E
