30|$|According to the {{literature}} related to CRNs, previous study on dynamic spectrum access (DSA) can be categorized as sensing-based access model, leasing-based access model, and <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based access model. In sensing-based CRNs [2 – 5], SUs acquire the information of spectrum holes through spectrum sensing and freely access the unoccupied licensed channels, without paying any leasing fees to primary system. The primary system is ignorant of SUs, and the quality-of-service (QoS) of PUs should be protected by a specific spectrum sharing mechanism. In leasing-based CRNs [6], the secondary system dynamically leases spectrum from primary system and owns exclusive right to access the leased spectrum. However, the spectrum leasing is not performed in real time and the SUs will keep the exclusive right until the lease term expires, which may cause a great QoS degradation to primary system once the PUs' services grow abruptly. The <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based CRN proposed in [7] is widely {{considered to be a}} viable market option that benefits both the primary and the secondary systems. The primary system can make extra profit via spectrum leasing (unlike in sensing-based CRNs) and SUs have full flexibility in utilizing the spectrum holes (unlike in leasing-based CRNs). SUs pay the primary system the channel leasing fees only for opportunistic access. The <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based model enables more flexible integration of DSA in the licensed spectrum via real-time spectrum leasing.|$|R
30|$|In this article, {{we study}} the spectrum-sharing {{mechanisms}} in <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based CRNs, which benefit both {{the primary and}} the secondary systems. The authors in [8] proposed a preemptive spectrum-sharing mechanism in <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based CRNs. This preemptive mechanism {{is the same as}} the traditional spectrum-sharing mechanism in sensing-based CRNs [2 – 5], which has the basic requirement that the PUs are not affected by the SUs' opportunistic spectrum utilization. A SU has to vacate the channel promptly when a PU returns and handoff to another spectrum hole. When no spectrum hole is available, the SU's ongoing transmission is terminated and the SU is preempted. In the preemptive mechanism, PUs have preemptive priorities over SUs. The preemptive mechanism causes significant force-termination probability for SUs [2]. That is not only a waste of resources (power and frequency), but also insufferable for SUs, especially for the SUs who lease spectrum for some guarantees of QoS. We originally present a non-preemptive (NP) spectrum-sharing mechanism, in which PUs have no preemptive priorities over SUs. A PU would wait for a period of time until the completion of the SU's ongoing transmission when no spectrum hole is available. No SU would forcibly be terminated by PUs. A QoS tradeoff will be achieved between the primary and the secondary systems. We focus on the performance analysis of spectrum-sharing mechanisms, which not only gives the evaluation of the spectrum-sharing mechanisms, but also provides a clue for future researches on strategies of primary and secondary systems in <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based CRNs.|$|R

30|$|In this article, a non-preemptive (NP) {{mechanism}} is {{proposed to improve}} the quality-of-service (QoS) of secondary users (SUs) in <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based cognitive radio networks (CRNs). In this spectrum-sharing mechanism, a primary user (PU) could not forcibly terminate a SU with ongoing transmission. Both the typical preemptive and the proposed NP mechanisms are modeled by multi-dimensional Markov chains with three state variables. A decomposition-approximated method is used to derive the closed-form solutions of the steady-state probabilities in the Markov chains. The analytical results are verified by numerical results. System parameters that affect performance metrics are also investigated in these two mechanisms. The simulation results show that in the proposed mechanism the performance metrics of SUs such as force-termination probability and mean system delay are improved significantly, with an acceptable loss of PUs' QoS in terms of mean waiting time and blocking probability. A QoS tradeoff can be achieved between the primary and the secondary systems. For QoS improvement of SUs, the proposed NP mechanism outperforms the preemptive mechanism in <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based CRNs.|$|R
30|$|This rest of {{the article}} is {{organized}} as follows. In Section 2, we first present the system model of a <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based CRN, and introduce the preemptive and the NP mechanisms based on three-dimensional Markov chains. We then derive the closed-form solutions of the steady-state probabilities in the Markov chains by decomposition approximation. In Section 3, we give the expressions of performance metrics. To verify the analytical solution, simulation results are carried out and the two spectrum-sharing mechanisms are compared and discussed in Section 4. Finally, conclusion is drawn in Section 5.|$|R

30|$|In the <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based CRN, {{the primary}} system leases its {{spectrum}} usage rights of shared channels to secondary system, and gets payoff from the secondary system as SUs opportunistically access the shared channels by sensing. Different from traditional sensing-based CRNs, QoS guarantee for SUs {{has to be}} considered in spectrum-sharing mechanism design. In this article, we propose a NP spectrum-sharing mechanism in the <b>joint</b> <b>leasing</b> and sensing-based CRN. We have modeled both the NP mechanism and the preemptive mechanism based on multi-dimensional Markov chains. The closed-form solutions of steady-state probabilities in the two mechanisms are derived approximately by a one-dimensional decomposing method. The expressions of performance metrics including mean system delay of SU and mean waiting time of PU are also described. The approximate analytical results are verified by simulation results, which demonstrate that the closed-form solutions of the steady-state probabilities can be used to estimate the performance of the spectrum-sharing mechanisms. With the analytical solutions, the performance metrics can easily be obtained. In addition, we have discussed the impacts of system parameters such as arrival rate, service time, buffer size, and number of available channels on performance metrics. For comparison, the performance of traditional preemptive spectrum-sharing mechanism has also been analyzed and the results show that the proposed NP mechanism significantly improves the SUs' QoS with an acceptable QoS degradation of PUs. According to the performance analysis, the system parameters have impacts on the QoS tradeoff between PUs and SUs. How to balance the QoS tradeoff between PUs and SUs by setting the system parameters in designing spectrum leasing strategy will be an interesting topic for future study.|$|R

50|$|Construction {{began in}} the winter of 1871 but was plagued with problems, {{including}} undercapitalization, frequent disagreements among the seven directors, and, at one point, an inability to meet payroll that resulted in the layoff of the railroad's workmen. In spite of these issues, the line was completed by the spring of 1872. Ultimately, however, the railroad's problems proved too great to overcome, and it would never officially open. The only train to pass over the route carried the railroad's officials as they inspected the completed work. The main reason cited for the railroad's failure was a lack of funds; however, other underlying issues also contributed. Chief among these underlying issues was that neither the Worcester and Nashua Railroad nor the Fitchburg Railroad ever exercised their lease agreements of the Lancaster Railroad in part due to disagreements over the details of the <b>joint</b> <b>lease.</b> Adding to the list of the Lancaster Railroad's problems was a lawsuit on June 22, 1872 alleging that the railroad had damaged a dam of the Holmes Manufacturing Estate in Hudson.|$|E
