5|$|Burnet made {{significant}} contributions to <b>influenza</b> research; he developed techniques to grow and study the virus, including hemagglutination assays. He worked on a live vaccine against <b>influenza,</b> but the vaccine was unsuccessful when tested during World War II. His interest in the <b>influenza</b> receptor led him to discover the neuraminidase that is secreted by Vibrio cholerae, which later provided the foundation for Alfred Gottschalk's significant work on glycoproteins and the neuraminidase substrate, sialic acid. Between 1951 and 1956, Burnet worked on the genetics of <b>influenza.</b> He examined the genetic control of virulence and demonstrated that the virus recombined at high frequency; this observation was not fully appreciated until several years later, when the segmented genome of <b>influenza</b> was demonstrated.|$|E
5|$|Burnet's major {{achievements}} in microbiology included discovering the causative agents of Q-fever and psittacosis; developing assays for the isolation, culture and detection of <b>influenza</b> virus; describing the recombination of <b>influenza</b> strains; demonstrating that the myxomatosis virus {{does not cause}} disease in humans. Modern methods for producing <b>influenza</b> vaccines are still based on Burnet's work improving virus growing processes in hen's eggs.|$|E
5|$|<b>Influenza</b> spreads {{around the}} world in a yearly outbreak, {{resulting}} in about three to five million cases of severe illness and about 250,000 to 500,000 deaths. In the Northern and Southern parts of the world, outbreaks occur mainly in winter while in areas around the equator outbreaks may occur at any time of the year. Death occurs mostly in the young, the old and those with other health problems. Larger outbreaks known as pandemics are less frequent. In the 20th century, three <b>influenza</b> pandemics occurred: Spanish <b>influenza</b> in 1918 (~50 million deaths), Asian <b>influenza</b> in 1957 (two million deaths), and Hong Kong <b>influenza</b> in 1968 (one million deaths). The World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a new type of <b>influenza</b> A/H1N1 to be a pandemic in June 2009. <b>Influenza</b> may also affect other animals, including pigs, horses and birds.|$|E
2500|$|Historically Haemophilus <b>influenzae</b> (H. <b>influenzae)</b> {{has been}} a {{significant}} cause of infection and both H. <b>influenzae</b> and S. pneumoniae {{can be found in the}} human upper respiratory system. A study of competition in vitro revealed [...] S. pneumoniae overpowered H. <b>influenzae</b> by attacking it with [...] hydrogen peroxide. However, in a study adding both bacteria to the nasal cavity of a mouse within 2 weeks only H. <b>influenzae</b> survives; further analysis showed that neutrophils exposed to dead H. <b>influenzae</b> were more aggressive in attacking S. pneumoniae.|$|R
50|$|Clinical {{diagnosis}} of H. <b>influenzae</b> is typically performed by bacterial culture or latex particle agglutinations. Diagnosis is considered confirmed when the organism is isolated from a sterile body site. In this respect, H. <b>influenzae</b> cultured from the nasopharyngeal cavity or sputum would not indicate H. <b>influenzae</b> disease, because these sites are colonized in disease-free individuals. However, H. <b>influenzae</b> isolated from cerebrospinal fluid or blood would indicate H. <b>influenzae</b> infection.|$|R

5|$|A {{pandemic}} is {{a worldwide}} epidemic. The 1918 flu pandemic, which lasted until 1919, was a category 5 <b>influenza</b> pandemic {{caused by an}} unusually severe and deadly <b>influenza</b> A virus.

40|$|Filter matings between E. coli K- 12 strains {{carrying}} an F'::Tn 5,Tn 9 factor with H. <b>influenzae</b> Rd strains {{gave rise to}} kanamycin-chloramphenicol-resistant H. <b>influenzae</b> strains at a frequency of approximately 10 (- 6). Transfer of the F' factor to H. <b>influenzae</b> was verified by expression of unselected markers in H. <b>influenzae</b> (lac+ or cotransfer of the nonselected antibiotic resistance), physical presence of a high-molecular-weight plasmid in recipient H. <b>influenzae</b> cells, and detection by Southern hybridization analysis of DNA sequences specific for the F' factor replication and partition functions in recipient H. <b>influenzae</b> cells. H. <b>influenzae</b> (F' Tn 5,Tn 9) strains were capable of transferring kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistances to other H. <b>influenzae</b> strains and were capable of mobilizing H. <b>influenzae</b> chromosomal markers at a low frequency. Insertion of a Tn 5 element in the H. <b>influenzae</b> genome near the novobiocin resistance gene increased the frequency of transfer of novobiocin resistance about 30 -fold. Transfer of other chromosomal markers also increased, although to a lesser extent, and ordered transfer of chromosomal markers could be demonstrated.

40|$|The sodC gene {{has been}} {{reported}} to be a useful marker for differentiating nontypeable (NT) Haemophilus <b>influenzae</b> from Haemophilus haemolyticus in respiratory-tract samples, but discrepancies exist as to the prevalence of sodC in NT H. <b>influenzae.</b> Therefore, we used a microarray-based, “library-on-a-slide” method to differentiate the species and found that 21 of 169 (12. 4 %) NT H. <b>influenzae</b> strains and all 110 (100 %) H. haemolyticus strains possessed the sodC gene. Multilocus sequence analysis confirmed that the 21 NT H. <b>influenzae</b> strains were H. <b>influenzae</b> and not H. haemolyticus. An inactive sodC gene {{has been reported}} in encapsulated H. <b>influenzae</b> strains belonging to phylogenetic division II. Capsule-specific Southern hybridization and PCR and a lack of copper/zinc-cofactored superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) expression indicated that 6 of the 21 sodC-containing NT H. <b>influenzae</b> strains in our study were likely capsule-deficient mutants belonging to phylogenetic division II. DNA sequence comparisons of the 21 H. <b>influenzae</b> sodC genes with sodC from H. haemolyticus or encapsulated H. <b>influenzae</b> demonstrated that the sodC genes of the six H. <b>influenzae</b> capsule-deficient mutants were, on average, 99 % identical to sodC from encapsulated H. <b>influenzae</b> but only 85 % identical to sodC from H. haemolyticus. The sodC genes from 2 / 15 NT H. <b>influenzae</b> strains were similarly more closely related to sodC from encapsulated strains, while sodC genes from 13 NT H. <b>influenzae</b> strains were almost 95 % identical to sodC genes from H. haemolyticus, suggesting the possibility of interspecies recombination in these strains.

People following organ transplantation or those otherwise-immunocompromised present high rates of cytomegalovirus pneumonia.

Subtraction identified 36 PCR fragments unique to strain G 622, which were used in a preliminary screen of 48 middle ear isolates and 46 nasopharyngeal and throat isolates to identify genes found more frequently among middle ear isolates. These experiments identified a PCR fragment with high homology to the lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis gene lic 2 B (originally identified in an H. <b>influenzae</b> type b strain) among 52 % {{of the middle ear}} isolates and 9 % of nasopharyngeal and throat isolates.
