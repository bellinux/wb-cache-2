40|$|We have {{established}} ex situ assurance colonies of two endangered Panamanian <b>harlequin</b> <b>frogs,</b> Atelopus certus and Atelopus glyphus, but observed that males fought {{with each other}} when housed as a group. Housing frogs individually eliminated this problem, but created space constraints. To evaluate the potential stress effects from aggressive interactions when grouping frogs, we housed male frogs in replicated groups of one, two, and eight. We measured aggressive behavioral interactions and fecal glucocorticoid metabolite (GC) concentrations as indicators of stress in each tank. In both small and large groups, frogs initially interacted aggressively, but aggressive interactions and fecal GCs declined significantly after the first 2 weeks of being housed together, reaching the lowest levels by week 4. We conclude that aggressive interactions in same-sex groups of captive Atelopus may initially cause stress, but the frogs become habituated {{within a few weeks}} and they can safely be housed in same-sex groups for longer periods of time...|$|R
40|$|Pounds et al. {{recently}} {{argued that}} the dramatic, fungal pathogen-linked extinctions of numerous <b>harlequin</b> <b>frogs</b> (Atelopus spp.) in upland rainforests of South America mostly occurred immediately following exceptionally warm years, implicating global warming as a likely trigger for these extinctions. I tested this hypothesis using temperature data for eastern Australia, where at least 14 upland-rainforest frog species have also experienced extinctions or striking population declines attributed to the same fungal pathogen, and where temperatures have also risen significantly in recent decades. My analyses provide little direct support for the warm-year hypothesis of Pounds et al., although my statistical power to detect effects of small (0. 5 °C) temperature increases was limited. However, I found stronger support for {{a modified version of}} the warm-year hypothesis, whereby frog declines were likely to occur following three consecutive years of unusually warm weather. This trend was apparent only at tropical latitudes, where rising minimum temperatures were greatest. Although much remains uncertain, my findings appear consistent with the notion that global warming could predispose some upland amphibian populations to virulent pathogens...|$|R

50|$|Very few {{fossils of}} early salientians have been found, which makes {{defining}} {{the characteristics of}} the group and their taxonomic relationships difficult. The arrangement of pectoral elements and the number of vertebrae are some guides, but the degree of vertebral articulation and the arrangement of the bones in the leg have not been found to be reliable indicators. The early proto-frogs developed from temnospondylid ancestors in which some of the elements of their vertebrae remained separate. The structure of the salientian pelvis and hind limb was probably developed for swimming rather than jumping. From the structure of the vertebrae, the group appears not to be monophyletic. The evolution of salientians seems to have been rapid and radiative. The essential features of recent groupings seem to have been established during the Mesozoic or early Tertiary. The families Alytidae, Pipidae, and Pelobatidae are ecologically isolated, the <b>harlequin</b> <b>frogs,</b> restricted to a neotropical range in Central and South America, and the Ranidae and Bufonidae probably radiated from tropical regions of Africa and Asia.|$|R
50|$|The <b>harlequin</b> poison <b>frog</b> {{lives on}} the forest floor. The male calls from a low perch to {{advertise}} his presence and the female lays eggs among the leaf litter. When the eggs hatch, a parent transports the newly hatched tadpoles to a tiny water reservoir (often in the axil of a bromeliad). The mother returns periodically and lays unfertilized eggs, on which the tadpoles feed until ready to metamorphose and exit the water. The larva is an obligate egg-feeder and will starve without this form of nutrition.|$|R
40|$|<b>Harlequin</b> <b>frogs</b> (Bufonidae: Atelopus) are a species-rich genus of Neotropical toads {{that have}} {{experienced}} disproportionately severe population declines and extinctions {{caused by the}} amphibian chytrid fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (Bd). The genus Atelopus is of high conservation concern, but relatively {{little is known about}} the population dynamics and life history of the majority of species. We examined the demography of one population of Atelopus zeteki and two populations of A. varius in central Panama using three to six years of mark-recapture data collected prior to and during an outbreak of Bd. We estimated male survival probabilities prior to the arrival of Bd and sex-specific population sizes for these three populations using state-space Bayesian population models. Prior to the arrival of Bd, monthly apparent survival probabilities were higher for A. varius males than for A. zeteki males, and recaptures among years were low in both species. Abundance of both species varied over time and declined rapidly after the arrival of Bd. Male densities were generally greater than female densities, though female densities were higher or equivalent to males after the arrival of Bd. Estimates of survival and abundance over time may be explained by differences in the use of stream habitat by the two sexes and three populations, both during and between breeding seasons. These estimates provide key baseline population information that can be used to inform reintroductions from captive assurance colonies and studies of extant Atelopus populations as part of conservation and management programs...|$|R

40|$|The {{disturbance}} vicariance hypothesis (DV) {{has been}} proposed to explain speciation in Amazonia, especially its edge regions, e. g. in eastern Guiana Shield <b>harlequin</b> <b>frogs</b> (Atelopus) which are suggested to have derived from a cool-adapted Andean ancestor. In concordance with DV predictions we studied that (i) these amphibians display a natural distribution gap in central Amazonia; (ii) east of this gap they constitute a monophyletic lineage which is nested within a pre-Andean/western clade; (iii) climate envelopes of Atelopus west and east of the distribution gap show some macroclimatic divergence due to a regional climate envelope shift; (iv) geographic distributions of climate envelopes of western and eastern Atelopus range into central Amazonia but with limited spatial overlap. We tested if presence and apparent absence data points of Atelopus were homogenously distributed with Ripley's K function. A molecular phylogeny (mitochondrial 16 S rRNA gene) was reconstructed using Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference to study if Guianan Atelopus constitute a clade nested within a larger genus phylogeny. We focused on climate envelope divergence and geographic distribution by computing climatic envelope models with MaxEnt based on macroscale bioclimatic parameters and testing them by using Schoener's index and modified Hellinger distance. We corroborated existing DV predictions and, for the first time, formulated new DV predictions aiming on species' climate envelope change. Our results suggest that cool-adapted Andean Atelopus ancestors had dispersed into the Amazon basin and further onto the eastern Guiana Shield where, under warm conditions, {{they were forced to}} change climate envelopes. © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{incredible}} diversity of lowland tropical rainforests; {{we still have}} limited understanding of the drivers of speciation in these ecoregions. In these difficult-to-access habitats that maintain a significant reservoir of the world’s biodiversity, it is widely accepted that {{a vast amount of}} species would remain undescribed and that some of them will likely go extinct before {{they have a chance to}} be properly described and studied. The present work studies the ecological, phenotypic and genetic diversification of Neotropical <b>Harlequin</b> poison <b>frogs</b> of the genus Oophaga, a group of organisms where a perplexing variation in colouration and patterns have led to taxonomic uncertainty. First, in order to investigate the relative contribution of geographical and environmental factors to the diversification of these frogs, I combined phylogenetic methods with detailed geographic data and environmental niche modelling (ENM) to test the role of geographic isolation, climatic niche divergence and altitudinal gradients. Overall, my results suggested that speciation along climatic gradients on a structured landscape has been a major evolutionary force behind the diversification of Oophaga poison frogs. Second, by using an integrative taxonomy framework and different lines of evidence derived from environmental data and intrinsic biological attributes (phenotypic variation, genetics), I statistically tested competing lineage-boundary hypothesis within the currently known Oophaga histrionica species. I found that diversity within the complex has been underestimated and proposed the existence of at least three independent evolutionary lineages of Oophaga poison frogs that should be further studied as they potentially represent new species to science. These results have important conservation implications as some of its members are considered amongst the most endangered species of all amphibians. Third, I hypothesized that the genes, pathways, and/ or gene networks potentially associated with colouration, alkaloid metabolism, transport and storage, should be highly expressed in skin tissue. Then, by taking advantage of the high coverage offered by Next Generation sequencing (NGS), I investigated the common transcriptional profiles of five Oophaga lineages. To my knowledge, this represent the first transcriptome dataset for Dendrobatid frogs where a functional annotation and comparative analyses allowed the identification of potential candidate genes in important adaptive traits. The identification of more than 250 orthologous contigs across lineages allowed testing the current phylogenetics hypothesis for this group. Overall, in this part of my work I provide an important molecular resource not only for the study of aposematism within Dendrobatids but for the future assembling and annotation of Dendrobatid genomes. Finally, <b>Harlequin</b> poison <b>frogs</b> represent an excellent group, yet underexplored, to study the ultracellular structural basis of colour variation and the role of candidate genes in colour variation. In this final part of my dissertation, I report the basis of histological-cellular components of colouration and provide initial hypothesis of the functional effect of mutations at the Melanocortin- 1 receptor gene (MC 1 R) and the genetic mechanisms of colour variation in this frogs. One of the most interesting findings was the observation of similar phenotypes appearing independently in nature as a consequence of different mutations of the same gene, a classical example of convergent phenotypic evolution and genetic repeatability. Broadly, I provided evidence to suggest that variation at the MC 1 R receptor could potentially be a major factor responsible for the high phenotypic variation of aposematic signals of <b>Harlequin</b> poison <b>frogs...</b>|$|R
