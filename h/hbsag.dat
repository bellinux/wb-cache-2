25|$|Screening {{consists}} of a blood test that detects hepatitis B surface antigen (<b>HBsAg).</b> If <b>HBsAg</b> is present, a second test – usually done on the same blood sample – that detects the antibody for the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg) can differentiate between acute and chronic infection. People who are high-risk whose blood tests negative for <b>HBsAg</b> can receive the hepatitis B vaccine to prevent future infection.|$|E
25|$|Humoral {{responses}} after {{a single}} DNA injection {{can be much}} longer-lived than after a single injection with a recombinant protein. Antibody responses against hepatitis B virus (HBV) envelope protein (<b>HBsAg)</b> have been sustained for up to 74 weeks without boost, while lifelong maintenance of protective response to influenza haemagglutinin was demonstrated in mice after gene gun delivery. Antibody-secreting cells migrate to the bone marrow and spleen for long-term antibody production, and generally localise there after one year.|$|E
25|$|Vertical {{transmission}} {{is a significant}} contributor of new HBV cases each year, with 35–50% of transmission from mother to neonate in endemic countries. Vertical transmission occurs largely via a neonate's exposure to maternal blood and vaginal secretions during birth. While the risk of progression to chronic infection is approximately 5% among adults who contract the virus, it {{is as high as}} 95% among neonates subject to vertical transmission. The risk of viral {{transmission is}} approximately 10–20% when maternal blood is positive for <b>HBsAg,</b> and up to 90% when also positive for HBeAg.|$|E
500|$|If {{the host}} {{is able to}} clear the infection, {{eventually}} the <b>HBsAg</b> will become undetectable and {{will be followed by}} IgG antibodies to the [...] surface antigen and core antigen (anti-HBs and anti HBc IgG). The time between the removal of the <b>HBsAg</b> and the appearance of anti-HBs is called the window period. A person negative for <b>HBsAg</b> but positive for anti-HBs either has cleared an infection or has been vaccinated previously.|$|E
500|$|The DNA {{polymerase}} is encoded by gene P. Gene S is {{the gene}} that codes for the surface antigen (<b>HBsAg).</b> The <b>HBsAg</b> gene is one long open reading frame but contains three in frame [...] "start" [...] (ATG) codons that divide the gene into three sections, pre-S1, pre-S2, and S. Because of the multiple start codons, polypeptides of three different sizes called large (the order from surface to the inside: pre-S1, pre-S2, and S [...] ), middle (pre-S2, S), and small (S) [...] are produced. The function of the protein coded for by gene X is not fully understood but it {{is associated with the}} development of liver cancer. It stimulates genes that promote cell growth and inactivates growth regulating molecules.|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{surface antigen}} (<b>HBsAg)</b> is most {{frequently}} used to screen {{for the presence of}} this infection. It is the first detectable viral antigen to appear during infection. However, early in an infection, this antigen may not be present and it may be undetectable later in the infection as it is being cleared by the host. The infectious virion contains an inner [...] "core particle" [...] enclosing viral genome. The icosahedral core particle is made of 180 or 240 copies of the core protein, alternatively known as [...] core antigen, or HBcAg. During this 'window' in which the host remains infected but is successfully clearing the virus, IgM antibodies specific to the [...] core antigen (anti-HBc IgM) may be the only serological evidence of disease. [...] Therefore, most [...] diagnostic panels contain <b>HBsAg</b> and total anti-HBc (both IgM and IgG).|$|E
500|$|Individuals {{who remain}} <b>HBsAg</b> {{positive}} {{for at least}} six months are considered to be [...] carriers. Carriers of the virus may have chronic hepatitis B, which would be reflected by elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and inflammation of the liver, if they are in the immune clearance phase of chronic infection. Carriers who have seroconverted to HBeAg negative status, in particular those who acquired the infection as adults, have very little viral multiplication and hence may be at little risk of long-term complications or of transmitting infection to others.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{appearance}} of the <b>HBsAg,</b> another antigen called [...] e antigen (HBeAg) will appear. Traditionally, the presence of HBeAg in a host's serum is associated with much higher rates of viral replication and enhanced infectivity; however, variants of the [...] virus do not produce the 'e' antigen, so this rule does not always hold true. During the natural course of an infection, the HBeAg may be cleared, and antibodies to the 'e' antigen (anti-HBe) will arise immediately afterwards. This conversion is usually associated with a dramatic decline in viral replication.|$|E
500|$|... virus (HBV) is {{a member}} of the {{hepadnavirus}} family. The virus particle (virion) consists of an outer lipid envelope and an icosahedral nucleocapsid core composed of protein. These virions are 30–42nm in diameter. The nucleocapsid encloses the viral DNA and a DNA polymerase that has reverse transcriptase activity. The outer envelope contains embedded proteins that are involved in viral binding of, and entry into, susceptible cells. The virus is one of the smallest enveloped animal viruses. [...] The 42nm virions, which are capable of infecting liver cells known as hepatocytes, are referred to as [...] "Dane particles". In addition to the Dane particles, filamentous and spherical bodies lacking a core can be found in the serum of infected individuals. [...] These particles are not infectious and are composed of the lipid and protein that forms part of the surface of the virion, which is called the surface antigens (<b>HBsAg),</b> and is produced in excess during the life cycle of the virus.|$|E
500|$|... virus DNA [...] {{persists}} {{in the body}} after infection, and in some people the disease recurs. Although rare, reactivation is seen most often following alcohol or drug use, or in people with impaired immunity. HBV goes through cycles of replication and non-replication. Approximately 50% of overt carriers experience acute reactivation. Males with baseline ALT of 200 UL/L are {{three times more likely}} to develop a reactivation than people with lower levels. Although reactivation can occur spontaneously, people who undergo chemotherapy have a higher risk. [...] Immunosuppressive drugs favor increased HBV replication while inhibiting cytotoxic T cell function in the liver. The risk of reactivation varies depending on the serological profile; those with detectable <b>HBsAg</b> in their blood are at the greatest risk, but those with only antibodies to the core antigen are also at risk. The presence of antibodies to the surface antigen, which are considered to be a marker of immunity, does not preclude reactivation. [...] Treatment with prophylactic antiviral drugs can prevent the serious morbidity associated with HBV disease reactivation.|$|E
500|$|Transmission of [...] virus {{results from}} {{exposure}} to infectious blood or body fluids containing blood. It is 50 to 100 times more infectious than HIV. Possible forms of transmission include sexual contact, blood transfusions and transfusion with other human blood products, re-use of contaminated needles and syringes, and vertical transmission from mother to child (MTCT) during childbirth. Without intervention, a mother who is positive for <b>HBsAg</b> has a 20% risk of passing the infection to her offspring {{at the time of}} birth. This risk is as high as 90% if the mother is also positive for HBeAg. HBV can be transmitted between family members within households, possibly by contact of nonintact skin or mucous membrane with secretions or saliva containing HBV. However, at least 30% of reported [...] among adults cannot be associated with an identifiable risk factor. Breastfeeding after proper immunoprophylaxis does not appear to contribute to mother-to-child-transmission (MTCT) of HBV. The virus may be detected within 30 to 60 days after infection and can persist and develop into chronic hepatitis B. The incubation period of the hepatitis B virus is 75 days on average but can vary from 30 to 180 days.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{record of}} an epidemic caused by [...] virus was made by Lurman in 1885. An outbreak of smallpox occurred in Bremen in 1883 and 1,289 shipyard employees were vaccinated with lymph from other people. After several weeks, and up to eight months later, 191 of the vaccinated workers became ill with jaundice and were diagnosed as suffering from serum hepatitis. Other employees who had been inoculated with different batches of lymph remained healthy. Lurman's paper, now regarded as a classical example of an epidemiological study, proved that contaminated lymph {{was the source of}} the outbreak. Later, numerous similar outbreaks were reported following the introduction, in 1909, of hypodermic needles that were used, and, more importantly, reused, for administering Salvarsan for the treatment of syphilis. The virus was not discovered until 1966 when Baruch Blumberg, then working at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), discovered the Australia antigen (later known to be [...] surface antigen, or <b>HBsAg)</b> in the blood of Australian aboriginal people. Although a virus had been suspected since the research published by Frederick MacCallum in 1947, David Dane and others discovered the virus particle in 1970 by electron microscopy. By the early 1980s the genome of the virus had been sequenced, and the first vaccines were being tested.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{leap forward}} in {{research}} was a serendipitous one by Dr. Baruch Blumberg, {{a researcher at}} the NIH who did not set out to research hepatitis, but rather studied lipoprotein genetics. [...] He travelled across the globe collecting blood samples, investigating the interplay between disease, environment, and genetics with the goal of designing [...] targeted interventions for at-risk individuals that could prevent them from getting sick. [...] He noticed an unexpected interaction between the blood of a patient with hemophilia that had received multiple transfusions and a protein found in the blood of an Australian aborigine. [...] He named the protein the [...] "Australia antigen" [...] and made it the focus of his research. [...] He found a higher prevalence of the protein in the blood of patients from developing countries, compared to those from developed ones, and noted associations of the antigen with other diseases like leukemia and Down Syndrome. [...] Eventually, he came to the unifying conclusion that the Australia antigen was associated with viral hepatitis. [...] In 1970, David Dane first isolated the hepatitis B virion at London's Middlesex Hospital, and named the virion the 42-nm [...] "Dane particle". [...] Based on its association with the surface of the hepatitis B virus, the Australia antigen was renamed to [...] "hepatitis B surface antigen" [...] or <b>HBsAg.</b> [...] Blumberg continued to study the antigen, and eventually developed the first hepatitis B vaccine using plasma rich in <b>HBsAg,</b> for which he received the Nobel Prize in Medicine in 1976.|$|E
5000|$|Hepatitis B: Two periods may be {{referred}} to as window period in hepatitis B infection: 1) the period that elapses during <b>HBsAg</b> to HBsAb seroconversion, i.e. between the disappearance of surface antigen (<b>HBsAg)</b> from serum and the appearance of HBsAb (anti-HBs), and 2) the period between infection and appearance of <b>HBsAg.</b> During the window of <b>HBsAg</b> to HBsAb seroconversion, IgM anti-core (HBc-IgM) is the only detectable antibody. HBV DNA may be positive as well. This window period does not occur in persons who develop chronic hepatitis B, i.e. who continue to have detectable HBV DNA for greater than 6 months (<b>HbsAg</b> remains positive), or in people who develop isolated HBcAb positivity, i.e. who lose <b>HBsAg,</b> but do not develop HBsAb (HBV DNA may or may not remain positive).|$|E

Afterward an immune system antibody to <b>HBsAg</b> is established in the bloodstream. The antibody is known as anti-HBs. This antibody and immune system memory then provide immunity to HBV infection.|$|E
50|$|Screening {{consists}} of a blood test that detects hepatitis B surface antigen (<b>HBsAg).</b> If <b>HBsAg</b> is present, a second test - usually done on the same blood sample - that detects the antibody for the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBcAg) can differentiate between acute and chronic infection.

50|$|Nitazoxanide {{alone has}} shown {{preliminary}} evidence of efficacy {{in the treatment}} of chronic hepatitis B over a one-year course of therapy. Nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily resulted in a decrease in serum HBV DNA in all of 4 HBeAg-positive patients, with undetectable HBV DNA in 2 of 4 patients, loss of HBeAg in 3 patients, and loss of <b>HBsAg</b> in one patient. Seven of 8 HBeAg-negative patients treated with nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily had undetectable HBV DNA and 2 had loss of <b>HBsAg.</b> Additionally, nitazoxanide monotherapy in one case and nitazoxanide plus adefovir in another case resulted in undetectable HBV DNA, loss of HBeAg and loss of <b>HBsAg.</b> These preliminary studies showed a higher rate of <b>HBsAg</b> loss than any currently licensed therapy for chronic hepatitis B. The similar mechanism of action of interferon and nitazoxanide suggest that stand-alone nitazoxanide therapy or nitazoxanide in concert with nucleos(t)ide analogs have the potential to increase loss of <b>HBsAg,</b> which is the ultimate end-point of therapy. A formal phase Ⅱ study is being planned for 2009.|$|E
