She has argued {{for the importance of}} the Critique of Judgment to Kant’s theory of cognition [...] and for the internal unity of the Critique of Judgment, which she sees as grounded in a notion of purposiveness as normativity. [...] Within Kant’s aesthetics, she has proposed a controversial <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgments</b> of beauty as self-referential judgments which claim their own universal validity. [...] This “austere” [...] account rests on a distinctive notion of normativity - a normativity not based on rules or concepts -- which also figures in her interpretation of Kant’s theory of biology.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper has}} the broad goal of inquiring {{into the role}} of empathy in {{contemporary}} <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> as enlarged mentality. Specifically, it puts Hannah Arendt in dialogue with Karl Jaspers, her mentor and friend, on this question. While a disagreement (or even a conversation) on this issue never seemed to emerge between the two, I argue that they offer differing <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> enlarged mentality and specifically of the role of empathy within it. Arendt is skeptical of empathy and unfavorably contrasts it with imagination {{when it comes to their}} role in enlarged mentality. Jaspers, on the other hand, offers an understanding of empathy as fundamental for communication and understanding of the other. It is, for him, a dialectic process of bracketing and drawing from one’s own experience. While Hannah Arendt did consider Jaspers' thought as a bright example of enlarged mentality, I argue that she underplayed the role of empathy, and of idiosyncratic, non-necessarily cognitive elements in Jaspers' own formulation of it...|$|R

40|$|The {{time needed}} for human adults to {{identify}} the numerically larger of two digits was studied. In Exp. I, the digits to be compared were presented in succession at two different exposure durations. In Exp. II, a single visually presented digit was compared with another digit held in memory. In both experiments, the larger the numerical difference, the faster the identification. The time needed {{to identify the}} numerically larger of two digits depends upon their numerical difference (Moyer & Landauer, 1967). In general, the larger the numerical difference, the shorter {{the time required to}} make the discrimination. A variety of reasons have compelled us to replicate the Moyer and Landauer finding. First, the result is of considerable theoretical importance for what it may imply about the general storage and use of numerical information. Second, we were surprised that college students, having had 15 or more years of experience with such decisions, would still take longer to decide that " 5 " is numerically larger than " 4 " than they do to decide, for example, that " 7 " is numerically larger than " 4. " Third, the error rate in the Moyer and Landauer experiment covaried strongly with judgment time. Using their published graphs, we have calculated a Spearman rank-order correlation of. 80 between error rate and judgment time. As a number of people have suggested, such a strong relationship between error rate and judgment time raises some obstacles to the unambiguous <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> <b>judgment</b> times (Egeth & Smith, 1967; Smith, 1968).

30|$|Coding valence {{presents}} {{another type}} of challenge. All previous studies agreed on using a one-dimensional scale to represent valence—either a numerical scale (e.g., Bradley and Lang 1999 used a 9 -point scale; Khoo et al. (2015) used a 7 -point scale) or a scale with ordered categories (e.g., positive, negative, and neutral in Baccianella et al. (2010)). Nonetheless, the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> a valence <b>judgment</b> is still unclear. In most studies, the valence scale is interpreted as a continuum from “positive” to “negative,” via “neutral” in the middle. However, in the seminal work that produced the ANEW (Affective Norms for English Words) database, Bradley and Lang (1999) asked participants to rate a word {{on a scale of}} “pleasantness.” Their methodology was replicated in a number of subsequent studies that built similar databases for other languages, e.g., Spanish (Redondo et al. 2007) and French (Monnier and Syssau 2014). Regardless of how the valence scale is labeled, the <b>interpretation</b> <b>of</b> a valence <b>judgment</b> can be ambiguous, as the perceived valence of a word may be either a <b>judgment</b> <b>of</b> the emotional experience encoded by the word (i.e., {{from the perspective of the}} experiencer) or an attitude toward the encoded emotion (i.e., from the perspective of a reporter). In the current study, by including both valence and the word’s emotional content (emotion type and intensity) in the rating task, we hope to unveil the distinction between the two perspectives.|$|R

Physicians generated hypotheses for case histories with two plausible diagnoses, one having a higher population base rate but less severe clinical consequences than the other. Case information {{indicative of the}} two diagnoses was varied. Generation proportions for the two diagnoses and confidence judgments both deviated from the predictions of a Bayesian belief model, but in different ways. Generation of a hypothesis increased with diagnosis-consistent information and diagnosis base rates, but was not reduced by diagnosis-inconsistent information. Confidence was sensitive to both consistent and inconsistent information, but was not very sensitive to diagnosis base rates. Physician characteristics also affected hypothesis generation and confidence differentially. Female doctors had lower confidence in their diagnoses than male doctors, yet there were no gender differences in hypothesis generation. Experience affected hypothesis generation monotonically via the increased availability of previously diagnosed cases, while confidence first increased and then decreased with doctors experience.

The aim of {{this thesis}} is to probe the alleged grounds of post-metaphysical thought in order to unearth its foundations. This genetic-systematic inquiry thus not only aims to scrutinize {{possible}} <b>interpretations</b> <b>of</b> the <b>judgment</b> the tribunal <b>of</b> reason {{is said to have}} passed on itself qua reason, but, more importantly, to revise the very judgment itself and to question the legitimacy of the tribunal. Apart from the fact that self-administered justice rarely results in convictions, the process seems ill-conceived from the start. The thesis sets in with an analysis of Quentin Meillassoux's recent invigorating and highly original re- discovery of post-metaphysical thought's unreason and a close reading of Kant's relevant pre- critical and critical works: while judgment was indeed passed in the name of "pure reason", it was not passed on reason itself but merely on its "logical" use. Only reason's usus logicus, not its usus realis were indicted by reason. In other words, the judgment has been misunderstood. The reason for this misunderstanding is located in Kant's philosophical presuppositions, which thus emerge as the very unreason of post-metaphysical thought. Since such unreason cannot [...] ...|$|R
