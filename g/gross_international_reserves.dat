40|$|We {{evaluate}} {{the global financial}} crisis (GFC) and the structural changes of recent years that {{have been associated with}} new patterns of hoarding <b>international</b> <b>reserves.</b> We confirm that the determining factors of <b>international</b> <b>reserves</b> are evolving with developments in the global economy. From 1999 – 2006, the pre-GFC period, gross saving is associated with higher <b>international</b> <b>reserves</b> in developing and emerging markets. An outward direct-investment effect is consistent with the view of diverting international assets from the <b>international</b> <b>reserve</b> account, the “Joneses’ effect” lends support to the rivalry hoarding motivation, and commodity price volatility induces hoarding against uncertainty. During the 2007 – 2009 GFC, those variables became insignificant or displayed the opposite effect, probably reflecting the frantic market conditions that prevent a normal economic relationship to hold. Nevertheless, the propensity to continue to trade displays a strong positive effect. The 2010 – 2012 post-crisis results are dominated by factors that have been mostly overlooked in earlier decades. While the effects of swap agreements and gross saving are in line with expectations, we find a change in the link between outward direct investment and <b>international</b> <b>reserves</b> in the pre- and post-crisis period. The macro-prudential policy is found to complement <b>international</b> <b>reserve</b> accumulation. Developed countries display very different demand behaviors for <b>international</b> <b>reserves.</b> Higher <b>gross</b> saving has been associated with lower <b>international</b> <b>reserve</b> holding because developed countries are more likely to deploy their savings in the global capital market.

In 2011, Ghana was the fastest growing economy in the world at 20.15% for the first half of the year and 14.4% at the end of the financial year according to the International Monetary Fund and EconomyWatch.com. Moreover, Ghana's budget deficit was reduced to 2% of the Gross Domestic Product during his tenure compared to 14.5% of GDP in 2008, just before he was elected as the President of Ghana. There was also a huge improvement in Ghana's <b>gross</b> <b>international</b> <b>reserves</b> and foreign direct investments (FDI) highlighting exceptional macroeconomic performance. The Mills government also implemented the Single Spine Salary system which increased compensation levels of all public sector workers. In a bid to improve the efficiency in revenue collection, Mills established the Ghana Revenue Authority which integrated Value Added Tax (VAT), Customs Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Under his governance, Ghana met three out of the four primary convergence criteria for the proposed common currency, Eco of the West African Monetary Zone.

40|$|Traditionally, two {{alternative}} explanations {{have been}} offered for the behavior of <b>international</b> <b>reserves</b> through time.
