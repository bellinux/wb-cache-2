The {{benefits of this}} method were proved for the sintering of refractory metals as well as conductive carbide or nitride powders. The starting boron-carbon or silicon-carbon powders were placed in an electrically <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> and compressed by two rods which also served as electrodes for the current. The estimated sintering temperature was 2000 °C.|$|E
50|$|Lava usually {{leaves the}} point of {{eruption}} in channels. These channels tend to stay very hot as their surroundings cool. This means they slowly develop walls around them as the surrounding lava cools and/or as the channel melts its way deeper. These channels can get deep enough to crust over, forming an <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> that keeps the lava molten {{and serves as a}} conduit for the flowing lava. These types of lava tubes tend to be closer to the lava eruption point.|$|E

5000|$|The fuse holder, {{also called}} the [...] "fuse tube" [...] or [...] "door", an <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> which {{contains}} the replaceable fuse element. When the contained fuse melts ("blows"), the fuse holder drops out of the upper contact, breaking the circuit, and hangs from a hinge on its lower end. This hanging fuse holder provides a visible indication that the fuse has operated and assurance that the circuit is open. The circuit can also be opened manually by pulling out the fuse holder using a hot stick.|$|E
5000|$|The {{design of}} the {{ball-pen}} probe {{is shown in the}} schematic picture. The probe consists of a conically shaped collector (non-magnetic stainless steel, tungsten, copper, molybdenum), which is shielded by an <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> (boron nitride, Alumina). The collector is fully shielded and the whole probe head must be oriented perpendicularly to the magnetic field lines. It is necessary to find the sufficient retraction of the ball-pen probe collector in order to reach , which strongly depends on the magnetic field's value. The physics of the ball-pen probe are not yet fully understood, but the collector retraction should be roughly below the ion's Larmor radius.

50|$|A coaxial igniter {{consists}} of a fully insulated conductor, covered by four strips of aluminum foil. All of this is further insulated in a tube about 1.6 cm in diameter that is perforated with small holes. The idea is to use an electrical flow through the conductor and then exploding the flow into vapor and then breaking it down into plasma. Consequently, the plasma escapes through the constant perforations throughout the <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> and initiates the surrounding propellant. A TCPI igniter is fitted in individual propellant cases for each piece of ammunition. However, TCPI is no longer considered a viable method of propellant ignition because it may damage the fins and does not deliver energy as efficiently as a FLARE igniter.|$|E

A negative temperature gradient, cold at the top and warm at the bottom, is found in <b>insulated</b> <b>tubes,</b> while the outside environment has a reverse gradient. This is explainable by the influence of gravity. These test results strengthen the suggestions of Loschmidt, and contradict the statements of Boltzmann and Maxwell...|$|R

The device includes a network of thermally <b>insulated</b> <b>tubes</b> for carrying a fluid {{which is used to}} produce smoke.

50|$|Circuit {{diagrams}} {{are pictures}} with symbols that have differed {{from country to}} country and have changed over time, but are now to a large extent internationally standardized. Simple components often had symbols intended to represent some feature of the physical construction of the device. For example, the symbol for a resistor shown here dates back to the days when that component was made from a long piece of wire wrapped in such a manner as to not produce inductance, which would have made it a coil. These wirewound resistors are now used only in high-power applications, smaller resistors being cast from carbon composition (a mixture of carbon and filler) or fabricated as an <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> or chip coated with a metal film. The internationally standardized symbol for a resistor is therefore now simplified to an oblong, sometimes with the value in ohms written inside, instead of the zig-zag symbol. A less common symbol is simply a series of peaks {{on one side of the}} line representing the conductor, rather than back-and-forth as shown here.|$|E
5000|$|Temistocle Calzecchi-Onesti's {{experiments}} with tubes of metal filings, {{as reported in}} [...] "Il Nuovo Cimento" [...] in 1884, {{led to the development}} of the first radio wave detector, the coherer, by Branly some years later. It was the first widely used detector for radio communication. This consisted of iron filings contained in an <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> with two electrodes that will conduct an electric current under the action of an applied electrical signal. The operation of the coherer is based upon the large resistance offered to the passage of electric current by loose metal filings, which decreases when direct current or alternating current is applied between the terminals of the coherer at a predetermined voltage. The mechanism is based on the thin layers of oxide covering all the filings, which is highly resistive. The oxide layers are broken down when a voltage is applied of the right magnitude, causing the coherer to [...] "latch" [...] into its low-resistance state until the voltage is removed and the coherer is physically tapped.|$|E
50|$|The {{golden eagle}} is not {{threatened}} at the species level but efforts {{need to be}} taken to prevent extinctions from many northern countries. The primary efforts undertaken to conserve the species have been, in order of prevalence from highest to lowest: conservation education and awareness, policy protection, directed land management, legislation and law enforcement and the provision of indentures. In Scotland, only 3 out of 16 regions in Scotland occupied by golden eagles since 1982 have been deemed favorable for conservation status, based upon the extent of local persecution, prey abundance and habitat change. The United Kingdom has put in place deterrent legislation to prevent behavior around the nest with the potential to cause harm and acts of willful harm to white-tailed eagles and some have advocated using the same policies for golden eagles. Education in this region mainly is undertaken by the Royal Society for Protection of Birds (RSPB). To curb the destructive practice of afforestation, some locals have switched to planting native Caledonian pine forests instead, likely resulting in much less harm to the native fauna possibly including golden eagles. While conservation efforts in Scotland have previously included the setting aside Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs), these are usually too small to benefit golden eagles. More recently, the United Kingdom government has instead taken from governmental policies enacted in Continental Europe the idea of Special Protection Areas (SPAs), which offers strong legal protection of single species. Potentially more than 7000 km2 may be set aside in Scotland as SPA for golden eagles. Some education of mountain-climbers in country holding breeding golden eagles has been undertaken by the Mountaineering Council of Scotland. Within the United States, the golden eagle is legally protected by the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act. In the United States, many studies of the effects of industrialization and development have been undertaken by the very companies attempting to develop near areas holding golden eagles, in order to understand and hopefully minimize harmful effects. For example, Swan Falls electric power-plant in southern Idaho has funded research into the effects of reconstruction activities on breeding raptors (including the golden eagles), the Arch Mineral Corporation has funded studies attempting to test and successfully relocate golden eagle nests and KENETECH Windpower and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory have funded research into the effects of turbine-based wind energy on golden eagles. In the 1970s in the United States, bounds were made {{to reduce the number of}} golden eagles to die from electrocution and wire-collisions. The primary change has been to raise the central insulator more than 1 m above the cross-arm and to position the ground-wire at a lower height on the pole, both likely to reduce the probability of golden eagles striking the wires with their wings. Also, the power company may place an <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> from 1 to 2 m on either side of the pole attachment or, especially if the previous modifications are not feasible, install raised perches at the top of the power pole. In Spain, the issue of electrocutions is more intractable because all pylons were made out of metal, which makes them much more dangerous to wildlife flying into them.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{systematic}} analysis {{of the effect of}} radial deformation on the atomic and electronic structure of zigzag and armchair single wall carbon nanotubes using the first principle plane wave method. The nanotubes were deformed by applying a radial strain, which distorts the circular cross section to an elliptical one. The atomic structure of the nanotubes under this strain are fully optimized, and the electronic structure is calculated self-consistently to determine the response of individual bands to the radial deformation. The band gap of the <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> is closed and eventually an insulator-metal transition sets in by the radial strain which is in the elastic range. Using this property a multiple quantum well structure with tunable and reversible electronic structure is formed on an individual nanotube and its band-lineup is determined from first-principles. The elastic energy due to the radial deformation and elastic constants are calculated and compared with classical theories. Comment: To be appear in Phys. Rev. B, Apr 15, 200...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Two {{electroplating}} {{test cells}} {{have been proposed}} and tested to analyze the performance of plating solutions by studying the reaction distribution on the cathode during deposition of copper electrolyte. The first one is a modified Mohler cell composed of a rectangular electrolytic cell with forced electrolyte flow and two flat electrodes (an insulating separator is inserted between the cathode and anode). This screen modifies the electric field distribution, and leads to a non-uniform current distribution or deposit thickness on the cathode panel. The other is a rotating cylinder Hull cell consisting of an inner rotating cylinder electrode coaxial with a stationary outer <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> to produce a non-uniform current distribution {{along the length of}} a cylinder cathode. These kinds of cells are developed to overcome the absence of a controlled mass transport condition associated with the tradition Hull cell. From the experimental results, it appears that the rotating cylinder Hull cell is a better device to characterize and control electrolytic bath, while the experimental errors of the continuous Mohler cell were accounted for using simulation...|$|E

50|$|Knob-and-tube wiring (sometimes {{abbreviated}} K&T) is {{an early}} standardized method of electrical wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s. It consisted of single-insulated copper conductors run within wall or ceiling cavities, passing through joist and stud drill-holes via protective porcelain <b>insulating</b> <b>tubes,</b> and supported along their length on nailed-down porcelain knob insulators. Where conductors entered a wiring device such as a lamp or switch, or were pulled into a wall, they were protected by flexible cloth insulating sleeving called loom. The first insulation was asphalt-saturated cotton cloth, then rubber became common. Wire splices in such installations were twisted together for good mechanical strength, then soldered and wrapped with rubber insulating tape and friction tape (asphalt saturated cloth), or made inside metal junction boxes.|$|R

40|$|A {{high pulse}} and average power low-induction load with a {{built-in}} divider is described in this report. The load has a nominal resistance of 25 Ohm and is designed to operate with a repetition rate of up to 50 Hz at a pulse duration (FWHM) of 100 ns, a rise/fall time of 50 ns and pulse amplitude of up to 50 kV. In this mode the dissipated energy is equal to about 10 J per pulse and average power is up to 500 W. At such a short pulse mode there is practically no heat removing from the load resistant layer during one pulse.

The load has a nominal resistance of 25 Ohm and is designed to operate with a repetition rate of up to 50 Hz at the pulse duration (FWHM) of 100 ns, at the rise/fall time of 50 ns and pulse amplitude of up to 40 kV. In this mode the dissipated energy is equal to about 6. 4 J per pulse and average power is equal up to 320 W.

40|$|The {{theory of}} the {{electromagnetic}} blood flow measuring technique is extended from the well known case (conductive liquid flowing through an <b>insulating</b> <b>tube)</b> to more realistic situations. First the conductivity of the vessel is taken into account, and the electric potentials in both liquid and vessel wall are calculated. The potential difference V between two points {{on the outside of}} the vessel and on an axis at right angles to both magnetic field B and the flow v is computed. The comparison is made with the classical flowmeter result V = 2 Ba[UNK] (a = inner radius of vessel, [UNK] = mean flow velocity). For an average artery, with a ratio of inside diameter to outside diameter of 0. 85, the error is found to be in the order of - 7 per cent. The blood is assumed to be four times as conductive as the wall tissue. The induced potentials are then calculated in the liquid, in the vessel wall, and in a thin liquid conductive layer surrounding the artery. A film of serous fluid which is likely to exist between a blood vessel and the applied flowmeter sleeve creates an additional shunt. The voltage between the flowmeter electrodes deviates from the expected result by - 10 to - 15 per cent if the film thickness is 3 per cent of the outside radius of the tube. The evidence is therefore established that flowmeter cuffs should fit the blood vessels accurately to minimize errors...|$|E

The procedure {{was based on}} a rapid (2. 5 min) microwave-assisted solubilization of biomaterial with tetramethylammonium hydroxide, simultaneous quantitative ethylation-extraction of the mercury species into hexane (15 min) and flash isothermal separation (15 - 30 s) using a multicapillary regular column (100 cm) or a minicolumn (22 cm). The chromatographic hardware necessary for sample introduction into a microwave induced plasma was downscaled to a split injection port and a 20 × 20 × 10 cm compartment (housing the 1 m column) or a 22 cm × 1 cm od thermally <b>insulated</b> <b>tube</b> (housing the minicolumn) maintained at a constant temperature and connected directly to the detector. No dilution of the GC eluent (60 - 120 ml min- 1) with make-up gas was necessary to achieve optimum sensitivity.

40|$|The {{formation}} of dry ice particles in a jet flow {{has been studied}} experimentally. The particles were produced by rapid expansion of liquid carbon dioxide through a nozzle, based on the Joule–Thomson effect. Their size distribution was measured by a laser diffraction method. The experimental {{results showed that the}} primary dry ice particles ejected from the nozzle were about 1 μm in mass median diameter. However, they grew initially in the jet flow and then became smaller due to sublimation. As a result, a bimodal size distribution was formed at increased distances from the nozzle outlet. The presence of a thermally <b>insulated</b> <b>tube</b> at the outlet of the expansion nozzle enhanced the agglomeration of the particles, whereby agglomerates of about 100 μm in mass median diameter were recorded. The agglomeration process is considered to take place by the simultaneous processes of particle deposition and reentrainment; i. e. agglomerated particles are reentrained from the layer of dry ice particles deposited on the tube walls. The agglomerate size decreased with increasing flow velocity, due to the greater detachment force applied to the deposition layer. Therefore, the flow velocity was found to be an important parameter influencing the agglomeration of dry ice particles...|$|R
40|$|An {{improvement}} {{has been}} made to the design of the hollow cathode geometry that was created for the rare-earth electron emitter described in Compact Rare Earth Emitter Hollow Cathode (NPO- 44923), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 34, No. 3 (March 2010), p. 52. The original interior assembly was made entirely of graphite in order to be compatible with the LaB 6 material, which cannot be touched by metals during operation due to boron diffusion causing embrittlement issues in high-temperature refractory materials. Also, the graphite tube was difficult to machine and was subject to vibration-induced fracturing. This innovation replaces the graphite tube with one made out of refractory metal that is relatively easy to manufacture. The cathode support tube is made of molybdenum or molybdenum-rhenium. This material is easily gun-bored to near the tolerances required, and finish machined with steps at each end that capture the orifice plate and the mounting flange. This provides the manufacturability and robustness needed for flight applications, and eliminates the need for expensive e-beam welding used in prior cathodes. The LaB 6 insert is protected from direct contact with the refractory metal tube by thin, graphite sleeves in a cup-arrangement around the ends of the insert. The sleeves, insert, and orifice plate are held in place by a ceramic spacer and tungsten spring inserted inside the tube. To heat the cathode, an <b>insulating</b> <b>tube</b> is slipped around the refractory metal hollow tube, which can be made of high-temperature materials like boron nitride or aluminum nitride. A screw-shaped slot, or series of slots, is machined in the outside of the ceramic tube to constrain a refractory metal wire wound inside the slot that is used as the heater. The screw slot can hold a single heater wire that is then connected {{to the front of the}} cathode tube by tack-welding to complete the electrical circuit, or it can be a double slot that takes a bifilar wound heater with both leads coming out the back. This configuration replaces the previous sheathed heater design that limited the cycling-life of the cathode...|$|E
40|$|Air {{condensed}} water ammonia absorption chillers are attractive for solar cooling {{because of low}} parasitic consumption and high thermal COP. The main drawback {{is the need for}} medium temperature heat (200 °C above ambient temperature). Heat storage at medium temperature is expensive and, fortunately, not necessary in solar cooling. Instead, cool can be stored in order to compensate for the intermittent availability of solar radiation. Based on this concept, two demonstration plants have been erected within the MEDISCO project. The first one makes use of a high concentration ratio (about 25) linear focusing Fresnel reflector, with highly <b>insulated</b> (vacuumed) absorber <b>tubes.</b> On the contrary, the second one relies on a low concentration ratio (16. 5) PTC, with glass covered atmospheric absorber tubes. The apparent contrast existing between the two solar technologies was the motivation for this study. Is the low concentration ratio PTC coupled with atmospheric absorber tubes an optimal choice from an efficiency point of view, at the temperature of interest for solar cooling? If so, would this still be the optimal choice with high performing vacuumed tubes available on the market nowadays? To answer these questions, optical and thermal characteristics of PTC are reviewed and a design optimization method for PTC is proposed. A PTC design optimization method is proposed along with the analytical formulation of collector efficiency and intercept factor. According to proposed method, PTC design for temperature difference above ambient in the order of 200 °C will be sensitive to the insulation level of absorber tube. Market available PTC with non <b>insulated</b> <b>tube</b> are optimally designed for the temperature range of interest.
