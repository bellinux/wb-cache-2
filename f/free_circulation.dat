The magazine focused on news of theatre design and its technology. Theatre Crafts began with a <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> to high school and college drama instructors. Geared towards the offstage performers, the magazine featured “how-to” articles from theatre designers of costumes, lighting, sets, and more.|$|E
25|$|The acrimony between Cristina Kirchner's {{government}} and the national media was exacerbated {{by a series of}} lock-ins carried out by the truck drivers' union led by Pablo Moyano, son of Hugo Moyano, a close ally of the Kirchner government. During the lock in, the country's most widely circulated newspapers (Clarín and La Nación) were prevented by force and threats of violence from distributing papers to newsstands. On 7 November 2009, the Association of Newspaper Editors of Buenos Aires (AEDBA) issued a statement in which it claimed that the truck drivers' unions' actions had been the fiercest attack on the <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> of newspapers the country had seen since its return to democratic rule in 1983.|$|E

25|$|Two of the {{original}} core objectives of the European Economic Community were {{the development of a}} common market, subsequently becoming a single market, and a customs union between its member states. The single market involves the <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU, and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market. Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally. The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union. Half the trade in the EU is covered by legislation harmonised by the EU.|$|E
500|$|Barkatullah {{himself had}} become closely {{associated}} with Krishna Varma during a previous stay in London, and his subsequent career in Japan put him {{at the heart of}} Indian political activities there. Myron Phelp, an acquaintance of Krishna Varma and an admirer of Swami Vivekananda, founded an [...] "India House" [...] in Manhattan in New York in January 1908. Amidst a growing Indian student population, erstwhile members of the India House in London succeeded in extending the nationalist work across the Atlantic. The Gaelic American reprinted articles from the Indian Sociologist, while liberal press-laws allowed <b>free</b> <b>circulation</b> of the Indian Sociologist. Supporters could ship such nationalist literature and pamphlets freely across the world. New York increasingly became an important centre for the Indian movement, such that Free Hindustan— a political revolutionary journal closely mirroring the Indian Sociologist and the Gaelic American published by Taraknath Das— moved in 1908 from Vancouver and Seattle to New York. Das established extensive collaboration with the Gaelic American with help from George Freeman before it was proscribed in 1910 under British diplomatic pressure. This Irish collaboration with Indian revolutionaries resulted in some of the early but failed efforts to smuggle arms into India, including a 1908 attempt on board a ship called the SS Moraitis which sailed from New York for the Persian Gulf before it was searched at Smyrna. The Irish community later provided valuable intelligence, logistics, communication, media, and legal support to the German, Indian, and Irish conspirators. Those involved in this liaison, and later involved in the plot, included major Irish republicans and Irish-American nationalists like John Devoy, Joseph McGarrity, Roger Casement, Éamon de Valera, Father Peter Yorke and Larry de Lacey. These pre-war contacts effectively set up a network which the German foreign office tapped into as war began in Europe.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to the study implementation of the Circular Letter of Directorate General of Correction Nomber E. PR. 06. 10 - 70 on <b>Free</b> Money <b>Circulation</b> at The Correction Institution and State Prisons in Jurisdiction of The Department of Law Human Rights of Central Java. The research is a sociological research based on the fifth concept of law. It is also a diagnostic – evaluatif. The data of {{the research}} were quatitatif - qualitatively and logically analyzed. Based on the results of research, it can be concluded that the circular letter of Directorate General of Correction Number E. PR. 06. 10 - 70 on <b>Free</b> Money <b>Circulation</b> in The jurisdiction studied has not be applicable. This is mainlycaused by : (1) legal structure : the number of human resources(legal apparatus) and adequate facilities and infrastructures is limited if compared to the number of prisoners; the coupon used as ID for prisoners is different from one prison to the another. This is causes a problem when a prisoners is transferrred from one prison to another; (2) legal substance : there is no manual that can be referred to in the implement of the circular letter; there is also no punishment for violation of the circular by either prisoner or officer; (3) legal culture : there is a felling of bondage among the prisoners and authorities that leads to bribery, blackmailing and collusion in the correction institution and state prison. This research suggests a need to evaluate the implementation of the circular by improving its implementation mechanism; the coupon usecd should be one type and the <b>Free</b> Money <b>Circulation</b> should be managed for the betterment of the prisoners during in the correction institution or after they are released back to the society. The implementation of the circular should also be followed by improvement in the facilities and infrastructure of the correction institution and state prison. Improvement in the human resources and incentive should also be taken. Finally, there should be harsh punishment for those who violate the circular. ...|$|R

All round the walls inside of this apartment moss was piled to the depth of twelve inches to exclude the cold, and this object was further gained by the spreading of a layer of moss on the deck above. The cabin hatchway was closed, and the only entrance was at the farther end, through the hold, by means of a small doorway in the bulkhead, to which was attached a sort of porch, with a curtain of deer-skins hung in front of it. In the centre of the floor stood an iron cooking-stove, which served at once the purpose of preparing food and warming the cabin, which was lighted by several small oil-lamps. These were kept burning perpetually, for there was no distinction between day and night in midwinter, either in the cabin or out-of-doors.|$|R
