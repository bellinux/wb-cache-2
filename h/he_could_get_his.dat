5|$|Todd's {{identical}} twin brother, Victor Lord, Jr. (Trevor St. John), {{whom he had}} never known, is physically altered and brainwashed {{to believe that he}} is Todd. From May 2003 to August 2011, he assumes Todd's identity. In 2003, the presumed dead Irene Manning had ordered a hit on the real Todd to keep him from exposing her agency. She had Todd strapped to a chair and made him uncover every detail of his life. She originally gave Victor Todd's scar, but then had Victor's face altered with reconstructive surgery to make him look like Mitch Laurence's long lost brother, Flynn Walker Laurence. Irene sent Victor away in Todd's place, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> share of the inheritance as Victor Lord Sr.'s heir, and unknowingly help the agency. She kept the real Todd locked up, instead of following through with the original plan to kill him. She eventually admits to these facts after Todd escapes and returns home. Todd struggles with losing eight years of his life, and blames Victor for stealing his children, including the daughter he had with Téa, Danielle (Dani). He plans to kill Victor and is the top suspect when Victor is gunned down. He claims his innocence and convinces Starr to help him escape jail to keep Irene from killing the family for Victor's fortune. Although Irene wounds him, Todd kills her. Téa's brother, Tomás (Ted King), takes credit for allowing a wounded Todd to escape. Todd begins having vivid memories of killing Victor. Before Tomás is sentenced, Todd confesses to Irene's murder; Téa gets the charges reduced to self-defense. Todd locates the gun used to kill Victor and uses it to frame Tomás as revenge for initially bringing him to Irene. Todd and a rogue CIA agent force Tomás into a false confession. Todd faces difficulty bonding with Jack, who only accepts Victor as his father, but he continues to bond with Starr and assists her with various issues. He also helps Cole Thornhart fake his death so he can live with Starr and their daughter, Hope, in California. Todd is later arrested for Victor's murder.|$|E

After his junior year at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he {{enrolled}} in a five-year program where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> bachelor’s and master’s after two more years. Guth obtained a bachelor’s and master’s degree in 1969 and a doctorate in 1972. In 1971, he married Susan Tisch, his high school sweetheart. They have two children: Lawrence (born 1977) and Jennifer (born 1983).|$|E
25|$|Price withdrew south, and Pleasonton pursued {{him into}} Kansas. He {{caught up with}} Price's army as it camped {{on the banks of}} the Marais des Cygnes River, near Trading Post in Linn County, Kansas. After an {{artillery}} bombardment that began at 4:00 a.m., Pleasonton's men launched a furious assault. Price ordered his troops to cross the swollen river, leaving Fagan to hold off the Federals until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> wagon train across. Although the Union captured two cannon and several prisoners, they were unable to prevent the escape of Price's force. Pleasonton continued his pursuit of Price, catching up with him again later that morning at Mine Creek.|$|E

25|$|My dad was not {{the monster}} my lying brother said he was; he was strict, but my father never beat us black and blue, and my brother Gary was a vicious, no-good liar for saying so. I have nothing but fond {{memories}} of Dad, going to studios with him, family vacations at our cabin in Idaho, boating and fishing with him. To my dying day, I'll hate Gary for dragging Dad's name through the mud. He wrote Going My Own Way out of greed. He wanted to make money and knew that humiliating our father and blackening his name {{was the only way}} he could do it. He knew it would generate a lot of publicity. That was the only way <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> ugly, no-talent face on television and in the newspapers. My dad was my hero. I loved him very much. He loved all of us too, including Gary. He was a great father.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{that the}} New York Central now {{depended}} heavily on connecting lines to reach Midwestern cities like Chicago, Cleveland, Detroit, and St. Louis, Vanderbilt decided to add Amasa Stone to the Central's board of directors. Stone was first {{appointed to the}} board in 1867, and probably served until December 1868. In April 1868, Stone {{played a major role}} in bringing together Cornelius Vanderbilt and the oil magnate John D. Rockefeller. Vanderbilt very much wanted the New York Central to carry both raw and refined oil being shipped by Rockefeller. On April 18, 1868, Vanderbilt asked Rockefeller (then visiting New York City) to meet with him. Rockefeller refused, sending only his business card. He believed Vanderbilt would try to charge him high freightage rates, and Rockefeller knew <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> oil to refineries and consumers without Vanderbilt. Vanderbilt persisted, however, and later that afternoon sent Amasa Stone to visit Rockefeller at Rockefeller's hotel. The two Clevelanders spoke for several hours, and Stone convinced Rockefeller to see Vanderbilt. The two men met that evening, and began a long and fruitful business relationship.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Conrad, {{during his}} 1914 visit to Poland just as World War I was {{breaking}} out, [...] "delighted in his beloved Prus" [...] and read everything by the ten-years-older, recently deceased author that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> hands on. [...] He pronounced The New Woman (the first novel by Prus that he read) [...] "better than Dickens"—Dickens being a favorite author of Conrad's. Miłosz, however, thought The New Woman [...] "as a whole... an artistic failure..." [...] Zygmunt Szweykowski similarly faulted The New Womans loose, tangential construction; but this, in his view, was partly redeemed by Prus' humor and by some superb episodes, while [...] "The tragedy of Mrs. Latter {{and the picture}} of [...] Iksinów are among the peak achievements of [...] novel-writing." ...|$|E

500|$|Later that year, Captain Sheldon gave Roddenberry an {{additional}} position as technical adviser {{for a new}} television version of Mr. District Attorney. Having spent the intervening years dissecting any scripts <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> hands on, and comparing them to the television output, Roddenberry advised {{the head of the}} studio's story department that he could write scripts as good as the ones they were using. He submitted his first script on October 22, 1953, under his pseudonym [...] "Robert Wesley". It went into production as episode 9b, [...] "Defense Plant Gambling". On December 1, he made a further request to the LAPD for a second job as a free-lance writer and adviser. This time it was approved. He later said, during the production of the second season of Star Trek, that the pseudonym was used after a fortune cookie revealed a message saying: [...] "A change of name will bring you fame." ...|$|E
500|$|In June 1661, he was {{admitted}} to Trinity College, Cambridge, {{on the recommendation of}} his uncle Rev William Ayscough, who had studied there. He started as a subsizar—paying his way by performing valet's duties—until he was awarded a scholarship in 1664, guaranteeing him four more years until <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> MA. At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, whom Newton supplemented with modern philosophers such as Descartes, and astronomers such as Galileo and Thomas Street, through whom he learned of Kepler's work. He set down in his notebook a series of [...] "Quaestiones" [...] about mechanical philosophy as he found it. In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that later became calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained his BA degree in August 1665, the university temporarily closed as a precaution against the Great Plague. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation.|$|E

According to Rimmer, games were not competitive there, and everyone won a [...] "you're really special" [...] trophy on sports day. He said that his sex life had been a [...] "shambles" [...] ever since one of Rimmer's brothers told him sex advice at school {{that the most important}} thing was the clitoris; Rimmer misheard it as [...] "to spit on her wrist".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{had several}} years of {{repairing}} and re-building guitars under his belt, Dean set out to create a guitar that would sound better and equally important, play better than what he had experienced testing all the brands <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> hands on in the repair business. [...] In the 1970s Gibson Guitars had a factory in Kalamazoo Michigan, where they used to provide tours for people. [...] Dean took one such tour to learn what machinery one would {{need in order to}} accomplish setting up a production run of their own designs. [...] Unimportant to the design of guitars, he later prevaricated his actions. [...] After two trips to the Kalamazoo factory, this quick study yielded a plan to seek out similar equipment to start his own company.|$|E
2500|$|Red {{attempted}} to demonstrate creative and often humorous ways to tackle relatively common tasks, such as {{taking out the}} trash or making use of derelict cars, or to create something extravagant out of whatever <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> hands on. Memorable examples included a paddlewheeler made out of a van on pallets and a revolving door, a jetpack made from two propane tanks, a hybrid car from recycled golf carts and satellite dishes, and a kiddie ride made from a bar stool attached to the agitator of a washing machine. Duct tape, [...] "the handyman's secret weapon," [...] was almost always the fastener of choice. In one episode, he tried to duct tape the Ontario-Quebec border as a potential solution to Quebec separatism.

2500|$|Although he was imprisoned, {{his natural}} {{abilities}} {{allowed him to}} develop extraordinary skills within the prison's walls. [...] He read as many books as <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> hands on, {{spent most of his}} spare time body building in the prison's gym, developed his own form of meditation, and learned to fight in the merciless school of prison life. Because of the cultural and supposed geographical location of Santa Prisca, Bane knew how to speak English, Spanish, Portuguese and Latin. [...] Despite his circumstances, he found teachers of various sorts during his incarceration, ranging from hardened convicts to an elderly Jesuit priest, under whose tutelage he apparently received a classical education. [...] Bane murdered this priest upon his return to Santa Prisca years later. [...] He committed his first murder at the age of eight, stabbing a criminal who wanted to use him to gain information about the prison.

2500|$|The 1906 Springboks became [...] "the first {{national}} team {{to utilize the}} 3-4-1 formation". South Africans credit Springbok Fairy Heatlie for developing the 3-4-1 formation in 1901 at the Villagers Rugby Club in Cape Town, fellow Villager Paddy Carolin for applying it on the 1906 South African tour of Britain, and Stellenbosch coach [...] "Oubaas Mark" [...] Markötter for perfecting it afterwards. [...] Under Markötter's instigation, {{and that of his}} protegé Danie Craven, South Africa had by 1949 perfected the 3-4-1 scrum formation. The hooker bound very loosely, and could swing his body so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>get</b> <b>his</b> feet to the ball {{as soon as it was}} fed into the scrum. The two locks would not push on the hooker, but their props, to make this easier. This made it very difficult for the opposition to get anywhere near the ball before it was hooked to the back of the scrum. It was at this time the terms loosehead and tighthead entered rugby terminology. Ever since the team feeding the ball has had a significant advantage, and won their own ball much more frequently.|$|E
