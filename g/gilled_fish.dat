40|$|The {{exchange}} of sodium and protons across the <b>gills</b> of <b>fishes</b> {{has long been}} associated with osmoregulatory and acid-base regulatory mechanisms in both freshwater and marine fishes. This thesis identifies several types of sodium/proton exchangers in the <b>gills</b> of <b>fishes</b> from different taxonomic classes. In addition, {{it was observed that}} the expression of sodium/proton exchanger messenger RNA was upregulated for 24 hours following induced metabolic acidosis in the Atlantic hagfish suggesting that sodium/proton exchangers have functioned in acid/base regulation from early in vertebrate history...|$|R
50|$|Though {{little is}} known about the {{conservation}} status of this species, it is believed that both overfishing and overexploitation are exeting a negative effect on natural populations. The Hebrew volute may occur in shallow water, which tends to facilitate its harvesting by the locals. Thus it is currently not observed in many areas in which it was known to be numerous before. It is not uncommon for Hebrew volutes to be accidentally caught in bottom <b>gill</b> <b>fishing</b> nets and traps set by commercial fishing boats.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis article {{presents}} an automatic system for assessing water quality based on <b>fish</b> <b>gills</b> microscopic images. As <b>fish</b> <b>gills</b> {{are a good}} biomarker for assessing water quality, the proposed system uses <b>fish</b> <b>gills</b> microscopic images in order to detect water pollution. The proposed system consists of three phases; namely pre-processing, feature extraction, and classification phases. Since the shape is the main characteristic of <b>fish</b> <b>gills</b> microscopic images, the proposed system uses shape feature based on edge detection and wavelets transform for classifying the water-quality degree. Furthermore, it implemented Principal Components Analysis (PCA) along with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) algorithms for feature extraction and water quality degree classification. The datasets used for experiments were constructed based on real sample images for <b>fish</b> <b>gills.</b> Training dataset is divided into four classes representing the different histopathological changes and the corresponding water quality degrees. Experimental {{results showed that the}} proposed classification system has obtained water quality classification accuracy of 95. 41 %, using the SVMs linear kernel function and 10 -fold cross validation with 37 images per class for training...|$|R

50|$|Recent {{research}} {{has revealed that}} C. geographus uses a form of insulin {{as a means of}} stunning its prey. This insulin is distinct from its own (with shorter chains) and appears to be a stripped down version of those found in fish. Once passing through their <b>gills,</b> <b>fish</b> experience hypoglycaemic shock, essentially stunning them and allowing for ingestion by the snail. This poison mixture has been referred to as nirvana cabal. Along with the tulip cone snail C. tulipa, no other species (with the exception of humans) is known to have used insulin as a weapon.|$|R

50|$|In <b>fish</b> <b>gills</b> {{there are}} two types of {{lamellae}}, primary and secondary. The primary gill lamellae come out of the interbranchial septum at the <b>fish</b> <b>gill</b> filament to increase the contact area between the water and the blood capillaries that lie in the <b>fish</b> <b>gill</b> filaments. The secondary gill lamellae are small lamellae that come out of the primary ones and are used to further increase the contact area. Both types of lamellae are used to increase the amount of oxygen intake of the blood. Both types of lamellae contain huge amounts of capillaries and are the sites where the exchange of oxygen from the water and carbon dioxide from the blood occurs.|$|R

Symptoms include mucus build-up on the <b>gills</b> of infected <b>fish</b> and hyper-plastic lesions, causing white spots and eventual deterioration of the <b>gill</b> tissue. <b>Fish</b> will show signs of dyspnoea such as rapid opercular movements and lethargy. Although usually recognised by hyperplastic and proliferative gill lesions, the effects of AGD occur before oxygen transfer across the gill is severely compromised.

Such effects result in compensatory changes in heart shape to improve its efficiency at pumping blood.|$|R

5000|$|However, {{tuna and}} {{mackerel}} sharks are warm-blooded: they can regulate their body temperature. Warm-blooded fish possess organs near their muscles called retia mirabilia that {{consist of a}} series of minute parallel veins and arteries that supply and drain the muscles. As the warmer blood in the veins returns to the gills for fresh oxygen it comes into close contact with cold, newly oxygenated blood in the arteries. The system acts as a counter-current heat exchanger and the heat from the blood in the veins is given up to the colder arterial blood rather than being lost at the gills.
