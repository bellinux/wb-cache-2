50|$|Notable {{species with}} limited {{distributions}} found here include the <b>horned</b> <b>curassow</b> (Pauxi unicornis), hummingbirds (Metallura theresiae, Heliangelus regalis), the long-whiskered owlet (Xenoglaux loweryi) and the Marañón poison frog (Dendrobates mysteriosus).|$|E
50|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>curassow</b> is {{threatened}} by habitat loss. Until 2004 the <b>horned</b> <b>curassow</b> was classified as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List due to a small and declining population, but was changed to Endangered in 2005 due to an estimated smaller range and greater rinsk from human activities. In Bolivia the potential habitat of subspecies P. unicornis unicornis may cover an area of 4,000 km2 including the national parks: Amboró, Carrasco and Isiboro Sécure. Despite concentrated fieldwork there are many parts of this potential habitat in which no individuals have found, for example the most north west 2,000 km2.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —The Cracidae {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{endangered}} and distinctive bird families in the Neotropics, yet the higher relationships among taxa remain uncertain. The molecular phylogeny of its 11 genera was inferred using 10, 678 analyzable sites (5, 412 from seven different mitochondrial segments and 5, 266 sites from four nuclear genes). We performed combinability tests to check conflicts in phyloge-netic signals of separate genes and genomes. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the unrooted tree of ((<b>curassows,</b> <b>horned</b> guan) (guans, chachalacas)) was favored by most data partitions and that different data partitions provided support for different parts of the tree. In particular, the concatenated mito-chondrial DNA (mtDNA) genes resolved shallower nodes, whereas the combined nuclear sequences resolved the basal connections among the major clades of <b>curassows,</b> <b>horned</b> guan, chachalacas, and guans. Therefore, we decided that for the Cracidae all data should be combined for phylogenetic analysis. Maximum parsimony (MP), maximum likelihood (ML), and Bayesian analyses of this large data set produced similar trees. The MP tree indicated that guans are the sister group to (<b>horned</b> guan, (<b>curassows,</b> chachalacas)), whereas the ML and Bayesian analysis recovered a tree where the horned guan is a sister clade to curassows, and these two clades had the chachalacas as a sister group. Parametric bootstrapping showed that alternative trees previously proposed for the cracid gener...|$|R
50|$|The Sira curassow is {{very similar}} morphologically to the <b>horned</b> <b>curassow,</b> however the casque is less erect and more rounded (ellipsoidal instead of {{elongated}} cone). Additionally the outer tail feathers have narrower white tips and the four central tail feather completely lack white colouring.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>curassow</b> or {{southern}} {{helmeted curassow}} (Pauxi unicornis) is {{a species of}} bird in the Cracidae family found in humid tropical and subtropical forests. It was first described by James Bond and Rodolphe Meyer de Schauensee in 1939 from a specimen collected in Bolivia, and further birds that were described by Weske & Terborgh from Peru in 1971 {{were thought to be}} a subspecies. However, the taxonomical position of this 1971 species or subspecies is unclear and {{further research is needed to}} clarify the position. The <b>horned</b> <b>curassow</b> as originally described is endemic to Bolivia. It is a large, predominantly black bird with a distinctive casque on its forehead. It is an uncommon bird with a limited range and is suffering from habitat loss, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated its conservation status as being [...] "critically endangered".|$|E
50|$|In 1969 {{another two}} birds, {{a male and}} female were {{discovered}} which resembled <b>horned</b> <b>curassow.</b> However they were found in Peru {{a long way from}} the previous P. unicornis discoveries in Bolivia. These Peruvian specimens were described by John Weske and John Terborgh in 1971 as a new subspecies of P. unicornis which they named in honour of Maria Koepcke.|$|E
50|$|It {{is a large}} {{terrestrial}} {{black curassow}} with a small head, large bluish grey casque on forehead, red bill, white-tipped tail feathers, greenish glossed mantle and breast feathers, and white below. Both sexes are similar. Length in adult birds can vary from 80 to 100 cm. The male, at 3.6 kg (8 lbs), {{is larger than the}} female, at 2.6 kg (5.8 lbs). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 36.3 to 42.7 cm, the tail is 30.4 to 36.2 cm and the tarsus is 8.9 to 11.2 cm. Some rare rufous morph female has a black barred and reddish brown plumage. For some time, it also contained the <b>horned</b> <b>curassow</b> taxa as subspecies. Nowadays its southern congener is considered a distinct species P. unicornis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>horned</b> <b>curassow</b> {{is among}} the largest cracid species. It {{measures}} 85 to 95 cm in length. Body mass in large males is up to 3.7 to 3.9 kg and only the great curassow is heavier amongst the cracids, although the black curassow and the closely related helmeted curassow are around the same length. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38.1 to 40.2 cm, the tail is 31 to 34.8 cm and the tarsus is 10 to 10.8 cm. It has a distinctive horn or casque on the forehead which projects for over 6 cm. The plumage is generally black, but lacks a blue sheen in primary feathers, and has a white belly, thigh tufts and under-tail coverts. The tail also has white tips.|$|E
