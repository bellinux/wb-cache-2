25|$|Diethylstilbestrol is a nonsteroidal {{estrogen}} that is {{no longer}} used medically. It {{is a member of the}} stilbestrol group. Other stilbestrol estrogens that have been used clinically include benzestrol, dienestrol, dienestrol acetate, <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> fosfestrol, hexestrol, and methestrol dipropionate. Chlorotrianisene, methallenestril, and doisynoestrol are nonsteroidal estrogens structurally distinct from the stilbestrols that have also been used clinically.|$|E
50|$|<b>Diethylstilbestrol</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (brand names Agostilben, Biokeral, Clinestrol, Cyclen, Estilbin, Estril, Neobenzoestrol, Orestol, Oroestrol, Ostregenin, Prostilbene, Stilbestriol DP, Stilboestrolum Dipropionicum, Stilboestrol, Synestrin, Willestrol, others), or {{diethylstilbestrol}} dipropanoate, {{also known}} as stilboestrol dipropionate (BANM), is a synthetic, nonsteroidal estrogen of the stilbestrol group that was formerly marketed widely throughout Europe. It is an ester of diethylstilbestrol with propionic acid, and is more slowly absorbed in the body than diethylstilbestrol. The drug {{is one of the}} most potent estrogens known.|$|E

To {{compensate for the}} diversity of growth rates among different cell lines in this report we describe a computerized kinetic chemosensitivity assay based on quantification of biomass by staining cells with crystal violet. As a prerequisite four human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB- 231, MCF- 7, T- 47 -D and ZR- 75 - 1) were characterized with regard to oestrogen and progesterone receptor content, modal chromosome number and proliferation kinetics depending {{on the number of}} passages in culture. With prolonged time in culture for ZR- 75 - 1 exposed to various concentrations of cisplatinum a dose-related increase in drug effect was observed. Owing to a correction of the T/C values for the initial cell mass (at the time when drug is added) a sharp distinction between cytostatic and cytocidal drug effects becomes obvious in plots of corrected T/C values versus time of incubation. The influence of the untreated control on the corrected T/C values and possible time courses of theoretical inhibition profiles (reflecting cytostatic, transient cytotoxic or cytocidal drug effects as well as development of resistance) and their relationship to the corresponding growth curves of drug-treated cells are discussed. Chemosensitivity assays with <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> <b>dipropionate,</b> tamoxifen, melphalan, cisplatinum, vinblastine, Adriamycin and 5 -fluorouracil prove the theoretical considerations to be true for MDA-MB- 231, MCF- 7, T- 47 -D and ZR- 75 - 1 human breast cancer cell lines in practice...|$|E
40|$|Eight {{pregnant}} rhesus monkeys were {{injected with}} 100 /Lg <b>diethylstilbestrol</b> <b>dipropionate</b> (DESDP) from the 40 th day of gestation until term, a long-term treatment. Male (n = 3) and female (n = 5) offspring were obtained. Five other pregnant females were injected with DESDP begin-ning on the 115 th day of gestation and continuing until either the 140 th day or term-a relatively short-term treatment. Five female infants {{were obtained from}} these short-term treatments. Monkeys from the treated preg-nancies were assigned randomly to mother-infant social groups containing untreated male and female infants the same age. They were observed in their peer groups each weekday from 3 to 12 months of age, and the display of mounting and play behavior was recorded for each subject. Results showed that DESDP significantly in-creased the frequency of display of these juvenile behav-iors only in long-term-treated females. However, one of the aspects of mounting that is characteristic of males (the ratio of complete to abortive mounts) was unaf-fected even by the long-term treatment. Thus, DESDP-treated females displayed a Iimited behavioral masculini-zation. Whether this limitation was due to dosage and/ or timing or to a selective action of DESDP was not de-termined. DESDP-treated males were not altered in any measurable way compared to untreated males.
