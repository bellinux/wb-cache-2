5|$|Test cricket {{returned}} from its hiatus in 1920 with the English touring Australia. Collins, also a selector, {{was one of}} six AIF XI players to make his début in the First Test of that series. The First Test was played on Collins's home ground, the Sydney Cricket Ground and Collins had reason to <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home,</b> scoring 70 and 104. Collins was only the fifth Australian to make a century on Test début. Collins scored another century in the Third Test at the Adelaide Oval, batting 258 minutes for 162, helping Australia to a 119 run victory. Over the 1920–1921 series, Collins made 557 runs {{at an average of}} 61.88.|$|E
5|$|Born in Stettin, Germany (now Szczecin, Poland), to assimilated Jews, Döblin {{moved with}} his mother and {{siblings}} to Berlin when he was ten years old after his father had abandoned them. Döblin would live in Berlin for the almost all of the next forty-five years, engaging with such key figures of the prewar and Weimar-era German cultural scene as Herwarth Walden and the circle of Expressionists, Bertolt Brecht, and Thomas Mann. Only a few years after his rise to literary celebrity with the 1929 publication of Berlin Alexanderplatz, Döblin was forced into exile by the rise of the Nazi dictatorship. He spent 1933–1940 in France and then was forced to flee again {{at the start of the}} Second World War. Like many other German émigrés he spent the war years in Los Angeles, where he converted to Catholicism. He moved to West Germany after the war but did not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in postwar Germany's conservative cultural climate and returned to France. His final years were marked by poor health and financial difficulties, and his literary work was met with relative neglect.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, {{she also}} played {{the lead role}} in The Magnificent Cuckold, based on the Belgian play Le Cocu magnifique. She was {{at the height of}} her sensuality at the time, but later the film only brought back {{unpleasant}} memories for her as she experienced little empathy with the producer Antonio Pietrangeli, while the male star Ugo Tognazzi tried to seduce her. In 1965, Cardinale appeared in Visconti's Vaghe stelle dell'Orsa, known as Sandra (Of a Thousand Delights) in the USA and Of These Thousand Pleasures in the UK, playing a Holocaust survivor who may have had an incestuous relationship with her brother. Later that year, she starred opposite Rock Hudson in Universal Pictures's Blindfold, the last film to be directed by Philip Dunne. Filming began on 22 February 1965 on location in Ocala, Florida. Diane Bond doubled for Cardinale in the film. Cardinale became good friends with Hudson, who proved to be very protective of her, knowing her discomfort outside of Italy. While in Hollywood, Cardinale also became friends with Barbra Streisand, Elliott Gould, and Steve McQueen, but she never managed to <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> there.|$|E

25|$|Baker, the character's recast, {{acknowledged}} {{the challenge of}} taking over a prominent character.

Before landing the role, Baker was screen tested with actors who often interact with the character (Jacob Young, who portrays JR Chandler and Bobbie Eakes, portrayer of the character's mother, Krystal). A few days after her audition, she received a phone call informing her that she had won the part.

25|$|The {{students}} of the University enjoy an unusual family tradition designed to make new students <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> and build relationships within the student body. Traditionally, a Bejant or Bejantine acquires academic parents who are at least in their third year as students. These older students act as informal mentors in academic and social matters {{and it is not}} uncommon for such academic family ties to stretch well beyond student days. Tradition has it that a Bejant may ask a man to be his Senior Man but must be invited by a woman who is prepared to be his Senior Woman. Similarly, a Bejantine may ask a male to be her Senior Man but there is no overt rule regarding how she acquires a Senior Woman. The establishment of these relationships begins at the very start of the first semester – with the aim of being in place ahead of Raisin Weekend.|$|E

500|$|Environment {{plays a role}} in all of the Shannara novels: [...] "Environment is a {{character}} in my story and almost always {{plays a major role in}} affecting the story's outcome. I have always believed that fantasy, in particular, because it takes place in an imaginary world with at least some imaginary characters, needs to make the reader <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in the setting. That means bringing the setting alive for the reader, which is what creating environment as {{a character}} is really all about." [...] However, Brooks believes that Sword was more about behavioral issues and personal sacrifice.|$|E
500|$|Whence, in {{the name}} of Count Buffon and Baron Cuvier, came those dogs that I saw in Typee? Dogs!—Big hairless rats rather; all with smooth, shining, {{speckled}} hides—fat sides, and very disagreeable faces. Whence could they have come? That they were not the indigenous production of the region, I am firmly convinced. Indeed they seemed aware of their being interlopers, looking fairly ashamed, and always trying to hide themselves in some dark corner. It was plain enough they did not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in the vale—that they wished themselves well out of it, and back to the ugly country from which they must have come.|$|E
500|$|During the {{creation}} of [...] God of War, the game's director David Jaffe attempted to create a version of Kratos that looked brutal but had a different appearance from what {{is considered to be}} the traditional Greek hero. The character's traditional armor was removed to show the character's individualism, and details such as hair and other [...] "flowing things" [...] were removed. Jaffe said of his final version of the character, that while [...] " [...] may not totally <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E

I wanted him to <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> with us, to feel wanted." [...] Washington won Boston fans over immediately. His acceptance was aided by a glowing article Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe wrote on the player after researching his life and spending some time with him. After the season, Washington took less money to re-sign with the Celtics over the Denver Nuggets.|$|E

500|$|Lost creators Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse were fans of Akinnuoye-Agbaje's work on HBO's Oz, {{and asked}} him to portray the character. Although Akinnuoye-Agbaje was not {{initially}} interested in joining the cast, he was persuaded by Cuse and Lindelof, but for a shorter period than they had in mind. Akinnuoye-Agbaje had a lot of influence on his character, changing the character's name and making adjustments to Eko's personality. After appearing on the show for one season, Akinnuoye-Agbaje asked Cuse and Lindelof to write his character out of the show because he did not <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Hawaii.

500|$|Charlie Wen, {{director}} of visual development on God of War and God of War II, {{is responsible for}} designing Kratos. Wen said that his direction for designing Kratos was as much influenced by similarly themed films as it was by pop culture, which led him to sketch a series of images of Kratos on napkins at a restaurant, introducing {{the idea of the}} double-chained blades and eventually Kratos' iconic design. Double-chained blades were chosen as Kratos' signature weapon because they emphasized the character's animal nature while also allowing combat to remain fluid. Jaffe said of the final version of [...] the character, [...] " [...] may not totally <b>feel</b> <b>at</b> <b>home</b> in Ancient Greece from a costume standpoint, I think he achieves the greater purpose which is to give players a character who they can play who really does just let them go nuts and unleash the nasty fantasies that they have in their head." ...|$|E
500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter.
