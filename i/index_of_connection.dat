However, the poor facility scale and layout around subway stations in practice usually cause the inconvenience of transfer and low transfer efficiency, which causes the declination of travel efficiency and even loose of subway passengers. Taking subway stations as the study objects, this paper has emphasis on the connection characters between various traffic modes and subway stations. Considering the attraction region, the total transfer time, transfer distance, and connection cost were selected to form the efficiency <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> layout of subway stations.

This study examined the trend in price movements and market integration for onion in rural-urban markets in Oyo state. Monthly retail prices in N/kg covering a period of eight years (2003 to 2010) were obtained from Oyo State Agricultural Development Programme (OYSADEP). Data were analysed using discriptive statistics, Augmented Dicker Fuller (ADF) test, Cointegration test, Granger causality test and <b>index</b> <b>of</b> market <b>connection</b> (IMC). Price trend analysis result revealed that price onion peaked in November and December. Lowest price was obtained in March (N 82. 40 /kg) and April (N 84. 14 /kg) for rural and urban markets respectively. ADF test revealed that prices were all integrated of order one I (1).

Both long-run market integration and short-run market integration for the main agricultural products are tested and analysed. The study also calculates the <b>Index</b> <b>of</b> Market <b>Connection</b> (IMC) to measure the degree of market integration of the main agricultural products. The study reveals that the major agricultural product markets in China are integrated in long-run, but the degree of short-run market integration is very low. Therefore, in agricultural product markets, the transmission of price information is very slow and price changes across regions are not responsive. Based on the research results, the study also discusses some policy implications to improve the degree of market integration of agricultural products in China. ...|$|R

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) offers an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> the <b>connections</b> between brain regions (via tractography) and of the white matter properties <b>of</b> these <b>connections</b> (via fractional anisotropy, FA). The reported studies generally show that lower FA values in left temporoparietal and frontal areas are indicative of poorer reading ability or dyslexia. Second, most {{studies have indicated that}} these regions coincide with the left arcuate fasciculus and corona radiata, with fewer studies suggesting a role for the posterior part of the corpus callosum or for more ventral tracts such as the inferior longitudinal fasciculus or the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus. Finally, a quantitative activation likelihood estimation (ALE) meta-analysis on all reported studies that used a voxel-based approach reveals a cluster located close to the left temporoparietal region (x=- 29, y=- 17, z= 26).

An integrated vegetable market will permit low spatial and intertemporal variation in prices, implying that commodity market prices will be functionally related. Vegetables are important sources of nutrients and income. The study assessed market integration between urban and rural markets of Amaranthus cruentus L, Corchorus olitorius L, and okra [Abelmoschus esculentus (L.) Moench] in South-western Nigeria. Data on monthly prices from 2004 to 2009 was collected from the Oyo State, Nigeria, Agricultural Development Project. Data were analyzed using augmented Dicker-Fuller and Granger causality tests and the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> market <b>connection</b> (IMC). Prices <b>of</b> A. cruentus and C. olitorius were stationary at its level, and the price of okra was stationary by the first difference. Johansen co-integration analysis indicated that rural and urban vegetable market prices are co-integrated and form part of the same market, indicating a flow of market price information. The Granger causality test suggested that urban and rural prices of Corchorus have a causal relationship. Rural okra and C. olitorius exhibited a bidirectional causal relationship. The IMCs for Amaranthus, Corchorus, and okra were 0. 64, 0. 26, and 3. 32, respectively, indicating that Amaranthus and Corchorus markets exhibit high short-run market integration, whereas okra exhibited low short-run market integration. There is quick transmission of prices between urban and rural markets for Amaranthus and Corchorus, whereas there is slow transmission of prices between urban and rural markets for okra because the flow of information regarding okra prices is not efficient. The policy implication of the study is that market price information should be made available to farmers through various agricultural programs and a market infrastructure including transportation and communication facilities should be developed.
