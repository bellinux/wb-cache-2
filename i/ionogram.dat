An ionosonde sweeps a range of frequencies, usually from 0.1 to 30nbsp&MHz, transmitting at vertical incidence to the ionosphere. As the frequency increases, each wave is refracted less by the ionization in the layer, and so each penetrates further before it is reflected. Eventually, a frequency is reached that enables the wave to penetrate the layer without being reflected. For ordinary mode waves, this occurs when the transmitted frequency just exceeds the peak plasma, or critical, frequency of the layer.

40|$|A {{variety of}} ground based radio {{techniques}} have provided new {{information relating to}} the nature of mid-latitude F-region irregularities responsible for frequency spreading on <b>ionograms.</b> Firstly, an analysis of <b>ionograms</b> covering a restricted frequency band indicates that frequency spreading is primarily caused by duplicate traces which are often unresolved in group path on standard <b>ionograms.</b> Furthermore, where angle of arrival information is available, the duplicate traces are shown to represent reflections from markedly different directions and the spread in critical frequencies is therefore indicative of a horizontal gradient in the peak electron density over a scale size of the order of many tens of kilometres. Secondly, the individual duplicate traces themselves are shown to comprise quasi-horizontal trace (QHT) segments which are unresolved on conventional <b>ionograms</b> and contribute to the diffuse appearance of spread-F traces on those <b>ionograms.</b> Difficulties in attributing these observations to the widely held view that scattering from small scale structures is the causative mechanism are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The IONORT-ISP system (IONOspheric Ray-Tracing – IRI-SIRMUP-PROFILES) was {{recently}} developed and tested {{by comparing the}} measured oblique <b>ionograms</b> over the radio link between Rome (41. 89 ºN, 12. 48 ºE), Italy, and Chania (35. 51 ºN, 24. 02 ºE), Greece, with the IONORT-ISP simulated oblique <b>ionograms</b> (Settimi et al., 2013). The present paper describes an upgrade of the system to include: a) electron-neutral collision have been included by using a collision frequency model that consists of a double exponential profile; b) the ISP three dimensional (3 -D) model of electron density profile grid has been extended down to the altitude of the D-layer; c) the resolution in latitude and longitude of the ISP 3 -D model of electron density profile grid has been increased from 2 °x 2 ° to 1 °x 1 °. Based on these updates, a new software tool called IONORT-ISP-WC (WC means with collisions) was developed, and a database of 33 IONORT-ISP-WC synthesized oblique <b>ionograms</b> calculated for single (1 -hop paths) and multiple (3 -hop paths) ionospheric reflections.

50|$|The {{time delay}} between {{transmission}} and reception is translated into effective ionospheric layer altitude. Vertical incident sounding uses a collocated {{transmitter and receiver}} and involves directing a range of frequencies vertically to the ionosphere and measuring {{the values of the}} reflected returned signals to determine the effective ionosphere layer altitude. This technique is also used to determine the critical frequency. Oblique sounders use a transmitter at one end of a given propagation path, and a synchronized receiver, usually with an oscilloscope-type display (<b>ionogram),</b> at the other end. The transmitter emits a stepped- or swept-frequency signal which is displayed or measured at the receiver. The measurement converts time delay to effective altitude of the ionospheric layer.

In contrast to the POLAN procedure, the technique introduced in this paper to pass from true to virtual heights is not based on any arithmetical operation related to changes of integration variables.

40|$|The use of {{ray tracing}} in the {{analysis}} of certain daytime <b>ionograms</b> recorded at Grahamstown is discussed in this thesis. A computer program has been modified and used to trace rays in the frequency range 1 - 30 MHz. Vertical, short distance oblique, and long distance oblique <b>ionograms</b> have been synthesized from the results and compared with experimental <b>ionograms</b> for Grahamstown, the Alice - Grahamstown transmission path (64 km), and the SANAE - Grahamstown transmission path (4470 km) respectively. Ray paths have been calculated and related in detail to the models of the ionosphere and geomagnetic field. The main features of the vertical and short distance oblique <b>ionograms</b> can, in general, be reproduced using spherically stratified ionosphere models with electron density profiles derived from vertical <b>ionograms.</b> A suitable model for the geomagnetic field is a tilted dipole equivalent to the actual field at Grahamstown. The two-hop mode is shown to be, usually, the lowest on the long distance oblique records. The ionosphere model is the principal limiting factor in reproducing such <b>ionograms,</b> and the most satisfactory results have been those obtained with a model in which electron density is assumed to vary linearly with latitude between the profiles at SANAE and Grahamstown.

40|$|We {{present a}} new method for the {{analysis}} of ionograms that evolves from methods developed for image analysis and utilizes techniques based on the concepts of fuzzy segmentation and connectedness. <b>Ionogram</b> traces (herein referred to as signals) are often not “crisply ” defined and it is demonstrated here {{that it is possible to}} approximate them as fuzzy subsets within the two-dimensional space defined by the time-of-flight (converted to virtual height in km) and the radio frequency. A real number between 0 and 1 is assigned to each pixel in an <b>ionogram,</b> thereby defining the membership of that pixel to each of the fuzzy subsets and creating a ‘gray scale ’ <b>ionogram.</b> In this manner, <b>ionogram</b> analysis becomes a problem in fuzzy geometry. Various geometrical properties, including the topological concepts of connectedness, adjacency, height, width, and major axis, will be defined in the context of <b>ionogram</b> analysis. Not only does the fuzzy segmentation process separate signals from the chaotic noise background that often characterizes ionograms, but it can also be applied to classify ionospheric echoes according to standard nomenclature, e. g. normal E, F, or Es layers. Furthermore, in reference to skeleton or thinning extraction in imaging processing, the fuzzy connectedness between echoes in selected segments can be used to determine the primary layers that are characteristic of vertical incidence ionospheric reflection. This information can be provided as input to automatic scaling or true-height inversion routines, which can then be used to derive either the standard set of ionospheric parameters or the electron density distribution in the overhead ionosphere.
