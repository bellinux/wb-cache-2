He signed a one-year deal with Stevenage, with the option of a second year. On joining the club he said [...] "I wasn't particularly looking for another club and I didn't {{have any interest in}} any other clubs at the time, so I thought I'd still be at Accrington next season. However, the manager got <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> agent and discussed the offer and when I thought I had the chance of playing League One football I decided to sign for Stevenage". Edwards was assigned the number six shirt ahead of the 2011–12 season. He made his Stevenage debut {{on the first day of}} the 2011–12 season, playing the whole match in a 0–0 home draw against Exeter City. Edwards made 13 starting appearances for the club, as well as a further 14 appearances from the substitute's bench, during the first half of the club's first ever League One campaign.|$|E

The pregnancy and other circumstances in her life inspired her to record a solo album. After contributing to fellow Fugees member Wyclef Jean's 1997 solo record The Carnival, Hill took time off from touring and recording due to her pregnancy and cases of writer's block. This pregnancy, however, renewed Hill's creativity, as she recalled in an interview several years later: [...] "When some women are pregnant, their hair and their nails grow, but for me it was my mind and ability to create. I had the desire to write in a capacity that I hadn't done in a while. I don't know if it's a hormonal or emotional thing... I was very <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> feelings at the time." [...] Of the early writing process, Hill said, [...] "Every time I got hurt, every time I was disappointed, every time I learned, I just wrote a song." ...|$|E

[...] "I will not lie to you; it was not a path of roses. It was painful at times to come up with two albums, to write more than 60 songs and to fight my own insecurities and doubts." [...] While speaking about the difference about expressing herself in Spanish and English, Shakira told, [...] "When I express myself in Spanish, I find elements that help me express an idea in perhaps a different way than when I do it in English. There are different aesthetics, but there is a certain style to the way I write my own songs, a particular way of describing feelings and emotions that I have developed over all these years making songs. I have gotten <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own gift - I am sure, 10 years ago, I was not half as good as I can say I am today, and I am still not good enough.

My writing was of the Middle Border, and must continue to be so. Its spirit was mine. All of my immediate relations were dwellers in the west, and as I had also definitely set myself the task of depicting certain phases of mountain life, it was inevitable that I should ultimately bring my workshop to Chicago which was my natural pivot, the hinge on which my varied activities would revolve.

It is not possible to name all of them here but I greatly acknowledge their efforts and contributions in every possible way. Foremost, I would like to express my sincere gratitude, to my supervisor Dr. Michael Feiginov, for providing me the opportunity to pursue my doctorate under his guidance. I am extremely indebted to him in many ways. First, I would like to thank him for providing me with his constant intellectual support and motivation for the past years. Second, I am grateful to him for his several critical reviews on my thesis draft. The many scientific discussions I had with him, during the course of my PhD, were always helpful to me to clarify my knowledge in the field of solid state electronics. Moreover, his penetrating insight in solving research problems was always a source of motivation for me. I am also grateful to Prof. Peter Meissner for referring my PhD dissertation and staying <b>in</b> constant <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> research work during the tenure of my PhD. Actually, I consider myself extremely fortunate to have two supervisors who are strict at the same time amiable. I am thankful to Prof. Hans. L.

In 1988, Wilson said that [...] "Dr. Landy doesn't like me to be <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> family too much. He thinks it's unhealthy." [...] Landy responded to the charges that he exerted too much control on the songwriter: [...] "He's got a car phone in his car. If he wants to call somebody, he calls somebody... He can go anywhere, on his own, anytime he wants." [...] Regarding Wilson's relationship to the Beach Boys at that time, Wilson added: [...] "Although we stay together as a group, as people we're {{a far cry from}} friends. One time we were doing an interview together, and the interviewer asked Carl what it was between him and me. He goes, 'Well, Brian and I don't have to talk to each other.

I must see <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own eyes; I must <b>in</b> a manner <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> own hands, not only the fixed, but momentary circumstances, before I could venture to suggest any political project whatsoever. I must know the power and disposition to accept, to execute, to persevere. I must see all the aids and all the obstacles. I must see the means of correcting the plan, where correctives would be wanted. I must see the things: I must see the men. Without a concurrence and adaptation of these to the design, the very best speculative projects might become not only useless but mischievous. Plans must be made for men. People at a distance must judge ill of men. They do not always answer to their reputation when you approach them. Nay, the perspective varies, and shows them quite other than you thought them. At a distance, if we judge uncertainly of men, we must judge worse of opportunities, which continually vary their shapes and colours, and pass away like clouds." [...] Our admiration at such words is quickly stifled when we recall the confident, unsparing, immoderate criticism which both preceded and followed this truly rational exposition of the danger of advising, in cases where we know neither the men nor the opportunities. Why was savage and unfaltering denunciation any less unbecoming than, as he admits, crude prescriptions would have been unbecoming? ...|$|R

JoJo says [...] "'Take the Canyon' is about cheating, and it's about only having a window of time to be with that lover and needing to get there as soon as possible for this illicit rendezvous. It's about taking the canyon–Beverly Glen or Laurel Canyon or whatever it may be." [...] The fourth track is titled [...] "Billions" [...] and was originally written about an old lover.
