50|$|There was {{worldwide}} {{shock at}} the huge loss {{of life and the}} procedural errors that had led to it. Public inquiries in Britain and the United States led to major improvements in maritime safety. One of their most important legacies was the establishment in 1914 of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS), which still governs maritime safety today. Additionally, several new wireless regulations were passed around the world in an effort to learn from the many missteps in wireless communications—which could have saved many more passengers.Primary to these improved regulations were the installation of radio equipment on ALL ships, fixed <b>Distress</b> <b>frequencies</b> and 24-hour watch on those frequencies.|$|E

The Animorphs are put in a cell, and they are freed by one of Visser One's Hork-Bajir; Visser One and Visser Three are rivals, and Visser One wanted to disgrace Visser Three. The Animorphs reach an escape pod and return to Earth. Marco's father returns to work.

5000|$|Ships in {{distress}} {{or the public}} reporting an accident should make a Mayday call on MF radio, marine VHF radio channel 16, or by dialling 999 or 112 on a telephone. The Coastguard MRCCs continuously monitor all the maritime <b>distress</b> <b>frequencies</b> (including the international VHF distress frequency 156.8 MHz) and have access to satellite based monitoring systems. The Coastguard MRCC then co-ordinates the emergency response. This normally involves requesting the launch of a local RNLI lifeboat (the RNLI being an independent organization), launching an independent lifeboat, deploying a local Coastguard unit, or a search and rescue helicopter, making broadcasts and requesting assistance from vessels in the area. Depending on the circumstances of each incident, the Coastguard MRCC may also request for other emergency services to be deployed to the incident or to meet other units returning from the incident, for example {{in the case of}} a medical emergency.

50|$|When {{sending a}} {{distress}} signal, the DSC device will at minimum include the ship's MMSI number. It will {{also include the}} coordinates if available and, if necessary, the channel for the following radiotelephony or radiotelex messages. The distress can be sent either as a single-frequency or multi-frequency attempt. In the former, a distress signal is sent on one band and the system will wait up to four minutes for a DSC acknowledgment from a coast station. If none is received, it will repeat the distress alert up to five times. In a multi-frequency attempt, the distress signal is sent on the MF and all the HF <b>distress</b> <b>frequencies</b> in turn. As this requires retuning the antenna for each sending, {{without waiting for an}} acknowledgment, a multi-frequency attempt should only be done if {{there are only a few}} minutes until the ship's batteries are under water. As the distress message can only be sent on one of the bands, many ships and coast stations may be listening to a band without the message, and will after five minutes relay the distress signal to a coast station.|$|E
