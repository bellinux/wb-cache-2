[...] This suggested that Howe would follow Washington if he went north to assist in the defence of the Hudson. [...] Howe, however, sailed from New York on 23 July. [...] On 30 August, shortly after his arrival at Head of Elk, Howe wrote to Germain that he would be unable to assist Burgoyne, citing a lack of Loyalist support in the Philadelphia area.|$|E
500|$|Heskey's {{international}} appearances under manager Steve McClaren were limited, {{although he}} was recalled to the England squad in September 2007 for the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers as cover for the injured Rooney against Israel and Russia, {{on the recommendation of}} Michael Owen, after stating that he wanted to play alongside Heskey. He started the match against Israel and {{played an important role in}} the England attack, and by featuring he became the first England player to be capped for England whilst playing for Wigan Athletic. Heskey also started the next match against Russia, fighting off competition from Peter Crouch for a place in the team, during which he created an assist for Owen's second goal. He was widely praised for his performances in the two matches, with former England international Alan Shearer commenting, [...] "Never in a million years did <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> be discussing whether Emile Heskey should keep his place ahead of Wayne Rooney but the Wigan striker was outstanding over both matches." ...|$|E

500|$|On January 7, 1986, John Poindexter {{proposed}} {{to the president}} a modification of the approved plan: instead of negotiating with the [...] "moderate" [...] Iranian political group, the United States would negotiate with [...] "moderate" [...] members of the Iranian government. Poindexter told Reagan that Ghorbanifar had important connections within the Iranian government, so {{with the hope of}} the release of the hostages, Reagan approved this plan as well. Throughout February 1986, weapons were shipped directly to Iran by the United States (as part of Oliver North's plan, without the knowledge of President Reagan) and none of the hostages were released. Retired National Security Advisor McFarlane conducted another international voyage, this one to Tehran; bringing with him a gift of a bible having a handwritten inscription by Ronald Reagan; and, according to George Cave a cake baked {{in the shape of a}} key. Howard Teicher described the cake as a joke between North and Ghorbanifar. He met directly with Iranian officials associated with Rafsanjani that sought to establish U.S.-Iranian relations in an attempt to free the four remaining hostages. [...] The American delegation comprised McFarlane, North, Cave (a retired CIA agent who worked in Iran in the 1960s–70s), Teicher, an Israeli diplomat Amiram Nir and a CIA translator [...] arrived in Tehran in an Israeli plane carrying forged Irish passports on 25 May 1986. This meeting also failed. Much to McFarlane's disgust, he did not meet ministers, and instead met in his words [...] "third and fourth level officials". At one point, an angry McFarlane shouted: [...] "As I am a Minister, <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> meet with decision-makers. Otherwise, you can work with my staff". The Iranians requested concessions such as Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which the United States rejected. More importantly, McFarlane refused to ship spare parts for the Hawk missiles until the Iranians had Hezbollah release the American hostages whereas the Iranians wanted to reverse that sequence with the spare parts being shipped first before the hostages were freed. The differing negotiating positions led to McFarlane mission going home after four days. After the failure of the secret visit to Tehran, McFarlane advised Reagan not to talk to the Iranians anymore, advice that was disregarded.|$|E

Bogard, who in 1924 founded the American Baptist Association, the two were often at odds. Bogard claimed that Norris was vain and prone to exaggerate Norris' ministerial success. Though he accused Norris of failing to preach the fundamentals of the faith, the two in time developed a begrudging friendship.

2500|$|Heller, a 1978 Boston University graduate, was heir to {{the capital}} of the Foreston Group, a family-owned {{conglomerate}} founded in 1906 that was the largest independent coal mining and distribution operation in the US, then valued at $150 million. In 1985, reviving the remnants of his family's real estate subdivision, Heller began developing residential real estate. During the years 1985-1990, he built some 1,500 apartments, including Le Chambord, a 23-story luxury condominium building at 350 East 72nd Street. About architecture, Heller expressed admiration of the iconic apartment houses of Rosario Candela. He founded Heller Macaulay Equities in 1989 with partner Duncan Macaulay. Of 1049 5th Avenue, Heller said, [...] "Never again in my lifetime do <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> see the chance to build a great building on or within a few steps of Fifth Avenue".|$|E

She {{was the first woman}} who ever represented the press at an international council. When she and her companion presented themselves at the council room, the French official refused them tickets of admission. “But, madam, you are a woman,” he said in explanation. “Yes, and in monsieur, <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find a gentleman,” she answered. The official went on to explain that a woman had never sat at such a gathering, and that it was impossible for him to allow her to enter. With characteristic persistency, Sullivan stuck to her point. she said,” do you not think that Paris should establish a precedent?” She and her companion were given tickets of admission. At the exposition, the President of France wanted to put her in a somewhat subordinate position at some great function held in Paris. She refused as representative of the American press to take it and through a telegram to James G. Blaine, then Secretary of State, she was given the place of honor.|$|E

They will be under my orders as Commander–in–Chief of the Allied Expeditionary Force, and shall communicate my orders to them through my Chief Political Officer. I am not extending the existing Occupied Enemy Territory Administration to places east of Jordan in the [...] "B" [...] area, such as Es Salt and Amman, but until such time as an Arab administration be formed later, I am merely appointing a British officer to safeguard the interests of the inhabitants. As regards the [...] "A" [...] area, notably the city of Damascus, I shall recognize the local Arab administration which <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> find in existence, and shall appoint French liaison officers as required. My communication with the French Political Mission will continue to be through my Chief Political Officer. I hope by the above procedure to safeguard French and Arab interests, while ensuring that supreme control remains in my own hands as Commander–in–Chief." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first prefrontal leucotomy on American {{soil was}} {{performed}} at the George Washington University Hospital on 14 September 1936 by the neuropsychiatrist Walter Freeman and his friend and colleague, the neurosurgeon, James W. Watts. Freeman had first encountered Moniz at the London-hosted Second International Congress of Neurology in 1935 where he had presented a poster exhibit of the Portuguese neurologist's work on cerebral angiography. Fortuitously occupying a booth next to Moniz, Freeman, delighted by their chance meeting, formed a highly favourable impression of Moniz, later remarking upon his [...] "sheer genius". According to Freeman, {{if they had not}} met in person {{it is highly unlikely that}} he would have ventured into the domain of frontal lobe psychosurgery. Freeman's interest in psychiatry was the natural outgrowth of his appointment in 1924 as the medical director of the Research Laboratories of the Government Hospital for the Insane in Washington, known colloquially as St Elizabeth's. Ambitious and a prodigious researcher, Freeman, who favoured an organic model of mental illness causation, spent the next several years exhaustively, yet ultimately fruitlessly, investigating a neuropathological basis for insanity. Chancing upon a preliminary communication by Moniz on leucotomy in the spring of 1936, Freeman initiated a correspondence in May of that year. Writing that he had been considering psychiatric brain surgery previously, he informed Moniz that, [...] "having your authority <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> go ahead". Moniz, in return, promised to send him a copy of his forthcoming monograph on leucotomy and urged him to purchase a leucotome from a French supplier.|$|E
