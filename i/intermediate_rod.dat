40|$|Since 1997 {{numerous}} fires {{have been}} reported to the Food and Drug Administration involving cylinder valves installed on medical use oxygen cylinders sold and operated within the United States. All of the cylinder valves in question had polychlorotrifluoroethylene (PCTFE) valve seats. Subsequent failure analysis showed that the main seat was the primary source of ignition. A review of the incidents involving cylinder valve fires indicated three possible ignition mechanisms: contaminant promotion, flow friction, and resonance. However, gas purity analysis showed that uncombusted, residual oxygen was within specification. Infrared and energy dispersive spectroscopy further showed that no contaminants or organic compounds were present in the remaining, uncombusted valve seat material or on seat plug surfaces. Therefore, contaminant-promoted ignition {{did not appear to be}} responsible for the failures. Observations of extruded material along the outer edge of the coined or loaded seat area produced by cylinder overuse or poppet overload led to concerns that accelerated gas flow across a deformed seat surface could generate enough localized heating to ignite the polymeric seat. Low molecular weight or highly amorphous quick-quenched PCTFE grades might be expected to be especially prone to this type of deformation. Such a failure mechanism has been described as flow friction; however, the corresponding mechanistic parameters are poorly understood. Subsequent revelation of low-temperature dimensional instability by thermomechanical analysis (TMA) in a variety of PCTFE sheet and rod stock samples led to new concerns that PCTFE valve seats could undergo excessive expansion or contraction during service. During expansion, additional extrusion and accompanying flow friction could occur. During contraction, a gap between the seal and adjacent metal surfaces could form. Gas flowing past the gap could, in turn, lead to resonance heating and subsequent ignition as described in ASTM Guide for Evaluation Nonmetallic Materials for Oxygen Service (G 63). Attempts to uncover the origins of the observed dimensional instability were hindered by uncertainties about resin grade, process history, and post-process heat history introduced by machining, annealing, and sample preparation. An approach was therefore taken to monitor property changes before and after processing and machining using a single, well-characterized lot of Neoflon CTFE. 1 M 400 H resin. A task group consisting of the current PCTFE resin supplier, two molders, and four valve seat manufacturers was formed, and phased testing on raw resin, <b>intermediate</b> <b>rod</b> stock, and finished valve seats initiated. The effect of processing and machining on the properties of PCTFE rod stock and oxygen gas cylinder valve seats was then determined. Testing focused on two types of extruded rod stock and one type of compression-molded rod stock. To accommodate valve seat manufacturer preferences for certain rod stock diameters, two representative diameters were used (4. 8 mm (0. 1875 in.) and 19. 1 mm (0. 75 in.)). To encompass a variety of possible sealing configurations, seven different valve seat types with unique geometries or machining histories were tested. The properties investigated were dimensional stability as determined by TMA, specific gravity, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), compressive strength, zero strength time, and intrinsic viscosity. Findings are discussed in the context of polymer structure-process-property relationships whenever possible...|$|E

40|$|NEUTROPHILS {{generate}} potent microbicidal molecules via the oxygen-dependent pathway, {{leading to}} the generation of reactive oxygen <b>intermediates</b> (<b>ROD,</b> and via the non-oxygen dependent pathway, consisting in the release of serine proteinases and metalloproteinases stored in granules. Over the past years, the concept has emerged that both ROI and proteinases {{can be viewed as}} mediators able to modulate neutrophil responses as well as the whole inflammatory process. This is well illustrated by the oxidative regulation of proteinase activity showing that oxidants and proteinases acts is concert to optimize the microbicidal activity and to damage host tissues. ROI and proteinases can modify the activity of several proteins involved in the control of inflammatory process. Among them, tumour necrosis factor-z and interleukin- 8, are elective targets for such a modulation. Moreover, ROI and proteinases are also able to modulate the adhesion process of neutrophils to endothelial cells, which is a critical step in the inflammatory process.

Since <b>rod</b> domains alone in vitro do not form filaments, the non-helical head and tail domains are necessary for filament formation.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the marginal misfit between intermediate and micro-unitmetal cylinder, by varying {{the angle of}} the implants, using two different types of material and different molding techniques. METHODS: A model was made with three implants (one perpendicular to the horizontal plane and two inclined) using micro-unit <b>intermediates.</b> A <b>rod</b> attached to the master model served as a control condition to {{evaluate the}} suitability of the twenty specimens, carried out {{with the help of an}} optical stereomicroscope (Pantec, Brazil; Materials Testing Laboratory, São Leopoldo Mandic, Campinas, São Paulo). RESULTS: Evaluator reliability was assessed using theIntraclass Correlation Coefficient, obtaining 99. 6 % (excellent). There were significant differences between groups, and the Mann-Whitney test compared groups in pairs for a more accurate result. CONCLUSION: The group which presented the best behavior was open tray and condensation silicone and the worst result, that needed to be cast several times, was closed tray and condensation silicone...|$|R

5000|$|The {{other type}} of {{light-sensitive}} cell in the eye, the rod, has a different response curve. In normal situations, when light is bright enough to strongly stimulate the cones, rods play virtually no role in vision at all. On the other hand, in dim light, the cones are understimulated leaving only the signal from the rods, resulting in a colorless response. (Furthermore, the rods are barely sensitive to light in the [...] "red" [...] range.) In certain conditions of <b>intermediate</b> illumination, the <b>rod</b> response and a weak cone response can together result in color discriminations not accounted for by cone responses alone. These effects, combined, are summarized also in the Kruithof curve, that describes the change of color perception and pleasingness of light as function of temperature and intensity.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Two short-wavelength cone opsins, frog (Xenopus laeVis) {{violet and}} mouse UV, were {{expressed}} in mammalian COS 1 cells, purified in delipidated form, and studied using cryogenic UV-vis spectro-photometry. At room temperature, the X. laeVis violet opsin has an absorption maximum at 426 nm when generated with 11 -cis-retinal and an absorption maximum of 415 nm when generated with 9 -cis-retinal. The frog short-wavelength opsin has two different batho intermediates, one stable at 30 K (ìmax 446 nm) {{and the other}} at 70 K (ìmax 475 nm). Chloride ions do not affect the absorption maximum of the violet opsin. At room temperature, mouse UV opsin has an absorption maximum of 357 nm, while at 70 K, the pigment exhibits a bathochromic shift to 403 nm with distinct vibronic structure and a strong secondary vibronic band at 380 nm. We have observed linear relationships when analyzing the energy difference between the initial and bathochromic intermediates and the normalized difference spectra of the batho-shifted <b>intermediates</b> of <b>rod</b> and cone opsins. We conclude that the binding sites of these pigments change from red to green to violet via systematic shifts {{in the position of}} the primary counterion relative to the protonated Schiff base. The mouse UV cone opsin does not fit this trend, and we conclude that wavelength selection in this pigment must operate via a different molecular mechanism. We discuss the possibility that the mouse UV chromophore is initially unprotonated...|$|R
40|$|Traditionally it was {{considered}} necessary for molecules to be either rod or disc shaped to full] the requirements necessary for liquid crystalline phase formation. However, recent moves away from these traditional theories {{have led to the}} discovery of molecules possessing geometries such as tetrahedral and even octahedral producing mesogenic phases. One molecular geometry not yet shown to display liquid crystalline behaviour is trigonal pyramidal. Group V elements exhibit such geometry. This thesis reports the synthesis of a number of novel phosphorus(IIl) molecules and an investigation into their possible liquid crystalline phase behaviour. Trigonal pyramidal phosphines together with the corresponding tetrahedral phosphine oxides, with three alkoxybiphenyl groups attached to a central phosphorus atom, were synthesised with varying alkyl chain lengths between C 1 -C 22. Investigation into liquid crystalline behaviour by both sets of compounds failed to demonstrate any mesophase formation. However, tri(nonyloxybiphenyl) phosphine oxide did show evidence of crystal to crystal transitions, often seen as a precursor to liquid crystaffine behaviour. Conversion of the phosphorus molecules into a more traditional linear shape by the replacement of an alkoxybiphenyl group with a smaller alkyl or phenyl group was also undertaken to investigate possible liquid crystalline behaviour, although none was observed. Attempts were also made to extend the length of the groups attached to the phosphorus atom to a tri-phenyl ring system incorporating an azo linking unit, which has often been shown to demonstrate mesophase behaviour. This led to the synthesis of a new series of compounds, phenyl (4 -alkoxyphenylazo) benzoates, which demonstrated both nematic and smectic C liquid crystalline phases. Unfortunately, synthesis of the desired phosphorus was not achieved. Di(alkoxybiphenyl) phosphine oxides separated by an alkyl spacer group, were synthesised in an attempt to produce H-shaped molecules, an arrangement that would be <b>intermediate</b> between <b>rod</b> and disc shaped molecules. Again, liquid crystalline behaviour was not observed. A series of mixed butyl and methyl phosphonium nonadecafluorodecanoates were shown to produce lyotropic liquid crystalline phases in accordance with those observed for the equivalent ammonium compounds...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Freshly {{isolated}} retinal photoreceptors of goldfish {{were studied}} microspectrophotometrically. Absolute absorptance spectra obtained from dark-adapted cone outer segments reaffirm {{the existence of}} three spectrally distinct cone types with absorption maxima at 455 4 - 3, 530 :- 3, and 625 + 5 nm. These types were found often recognizable by gross cellular morphology. Side-illuminated cone outer segments were dichroic. The measured dichroic ratio for the main absorption band of each type was 2 - 3 : 1. Rapidly bleached cells revealed spectral and dichroic transitions in regions near 400 - 410, 435 - 455, and 350 - 360 nm. These photoproducts decay about fivefold {{as fast as the}} <b>intermediates</b> in frog <b>rods.</b> The spectral maxima of photoproducts, combined with other evidence, indicate that retinene 2 is the chromophore of all three cone pigments. The average specific optical density for goldfish cone outer segments was found to be 0. 0124 0. 0015 /,m. The spectra of the blue-, and green-absorbing cones appeared to match porphyropsin standards with halfband width A = 4, 832 + 100 cm-'. The red-absorbing spectrum was found narrower, having Av = 3, 625 100 cm-l. The results are consistent with the notion that visual pigment concentration within the outer segments is about the same for frog rods and goldfish cones, but that the blue-, and greenabsorbing pigments possess molar extinctions of 30, 000 liter/mol cm. The redabsorbing pigment was found to have extinction of 40, 000 liter/mol cm, assuming invariance of oscillator strength among the three cone spectra...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Oxidative {{stress is}} {{involved}} in retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and retinal damage by light, characterized by Reactive Oxygen <b>Intermediates</b> (ROI) production. <b>Rod</b> Outer Segments (OS), display a mitochondria-like activity, producing ATP and consuming oxygen through {{the expression of the}} electron transfer chain (ETC) complexes Iâ€“IV and F 1 Fo-ATP synthase. As the ETC is a major source of ROI generation, here we investigated the ultimate ROI source in the OS after blue light (BL) or ambient light irradiation. Methods Samples were: purified bovine OS and organotypic model of photoreceptors (from C 57 BL/ 6 mice) irradiated with BL (peak, 405 nm). Histochemical assays were conducted on unfixed eye culture sections. To test ROI, 5 -(and- 6) -chloromethyl- 2 â€², 7 â€²-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate was used both for cyofluorimentric assay in purified OS and for live staining of retinas explanted from eye cultures. Oxidative metabolism was investigated by ATP synthesis and oximetry in purified OS. Malondialdehyd (MDA) concentration in OS homogenates was evaluated. Results Under BL stress, ROI and MDA production increased while O 2 consumption and ATP synthesis were impaired in OS after 6 h BL treatment. Impairment of respiratory Complexes I and II after BL exposure, both in the OS and IS was found. In ambient light, purifed OS, {{even in the absence of}} respiring substrates, produced a consistent amount of ROI, while in the dark, OS ATP synthesis is negligible. Conclusions Likely, severe malfunctioning of OS aerobic respiratory capacity after BL treatment is secondary to a self-induced damage after initial over-functioning of both phototransduction and respiratory chain, with ROI production. Correlation among ROI production and phototransduction activity as well as possible antioxidant supplementation are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Comparison of monocular and {{binocular}} critical flash intensities {{for recognition}} of flicker, using a centrally fixated square image subtending ca. 6. 13 ° {{on a side}} (white light), shows that for the cone segment of the response contour the inflection point of the probability integral correlating flash frequency F (for symmetrical flicker) and log mean critical flash intensity Im is with the binocular measurements exactly intermediate between those for each eye separately. This {{does not mean that}} in general the data are intermediate; they are not; the binocular asymptotic Fmax. agrees with or lies above the greater one of the two uniocular curves. The entire contour must be considered for valid intercomparisons, as is also true if homologous curves for different observers are to be compared. For the measurements in the predominantly rod region the binocular data are more or less <b>intermediate.</b> The <b>rod</b> curves result, however, from the integrative interplay of rod and cone effects for which the intrinsic curves overlap. The resultant rod curve as measured is determined by the partial inhibition of rod effects by cone effects, and by the summation of the remaining rod contributions with those labelled cone in origin. It is pointed out that in this respect, as in others, it is desirable to consider the rôles of retinal area, and location, from the standpoint of integration of neural effects. These phenomena are essentially independent of the light-time fraction and of the spectral (λ) quality of the light used. For binocular, as for uniocular excitation, the normal probability summation provides an efficient general description, under diverse conditions of size and location of retinal image, wave-length composition of light, light-time cycle-fraction, and kind of animal. It is pointed out that this is the only function abstractly likely to exhibit this kind of efficiency. That a summation of veritable effects independently generated by simultaneous, symmetrical uniocular excitation does occur in the recognition of flicker is specifically demonstrated by the fact that for a given mean critical flash intensity the associated variation is lower for binocular than for either or the average of the single-eyed presentations,—and in the ratio not statistically different from 1 : 1. 41; the relative scatter of the binocular indices of dispersion is also reduced below the uniocular. Since the mean variation of the critical intensity is statistically in a constant ratio to Im, in appropriately homogeneous series, independent for example of the brightness level and of the light-time fraction, this signifies an essential doubling of the effectiveness (potential) of each of the elements concerned in the discrimination of flicker when binocular excitation is concerned, although the total number of these elements is only slightly or not at all affected. The potential in question is not exclusively correlated with subjective brightness-at-fusion, which is, however, increased with binocular regard...|$|R
