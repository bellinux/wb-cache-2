5|$|While {{the actual}} pitched battle was short, the French infantry, under Marshal Marmont, {{and most of}} all the cavalry, under General Emmanuel de Grouchy, {{launched}} a relentless pursuit that rode down the enemy. Retreating in slow-moving square formations in broad daylight and along some excellent cavalry terrain, the Coalition forces suffered very heavy losses, with several squares broken by the French cavalry. At nightfall, combat ceased and Blücher opted for an exhausting night march <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> his remaining forces to safety.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Gilbert de Greenlaw, Bishop of Aberdeen, in 1421, Lichton was chosen as his successor, and was {{translated}} to the diocese of Aberdeen in early April 1422, on the authority of Pope Martin V. Pope Martin delegated authority to Robert de Cardeny, Bishop of Dunkeld, and William Stephen, Bishop of Dunblane, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Lichton's oath to the Papal see without forcing him to travel to Rome. It is of note that Lichton had already been in possession of the prebend of Kinkell in the Aberdeen diocese, a former possession of the Knights Hospitaller but attached to Aberdeen Cathedral by Lichton's time.|$|E

Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: {{he seems to have}} thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E

5|$|Gunfights {{are a major}} {{gameplay}} mechanic in Red Dead Redemption. The {{player can}} take cover, target a specific person or animal, blindfire, and free aim. Individual body parts can also be targeted, <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> targets down non-lethally. When the player shoots an enemy, the game engine uniquely creates the AI reactions and movements depending on where they were hit. The player character can choose from period-accurate weapons including revolvers, pistols, lever or bolt-action rifles, shotguns, sniper rifles, knives, explosives, lassos, mounted Gatling guns, and cannons. Duels utilize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic known as Dead Eye. Dead Eye is a targeting system that is used in a bullet time-like manner, allowing the player to slow down time to place a precise shot or paint in multiple shots. When the targeting sequence ends, Marston automatically fires to all marked locations in extremely quick succession.|$|E
5|$|Idris' {{government}} was increasingly unpopular {{by the latter}} 1960s; it had exacerbated Libya's traditional regional and tribal divisions by centralising the country's federal system <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> advantage of the country's oil wealth, while corruption and entrenched systems of patronage were widespread throughout the oil industry. Arab nationalism was increasingly popular, and protests flared up following Egypt's 1967 defeat in the Six-Day War with Israel; allied to the Western powers, Idris' administration was seen as pro-Israeli. Anti-Western riots broke out in Tripoli and Benghazi, while Libyan workers shut down oil terminals in solidarity with Egypt. By 1969, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency was expecting segments of Libya's armed forces to launch a coup. Although claims have been made that they knew of Gaddafi's Free Officers Movement, they have since claimed ignorance, stating that they were monitoring Abdul Aziz Shalhi's Black Boots revolutionary group.|$|E

5|$|In March 2005, Underoath {{participated in}} the inaugural Taste of Chaos tour, and shortly after, {{embarked}} on their first headlining tour. The band premiered two brand-new songs during {{the length of the}} tour. They played a part of the Warped Tour, but declined to perform for the entirety of the tour <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> time to record another album. Underoath made their first covers of national magazines appearing on CCM Magazine in July 2005 and then Alternative Press in September, and in October, They're Only Chasing Safety was re-released in a two-disc set with four formerly unreleased songs. Also included was re-mastered album artwork by Jacob Bannon of Converge, and a DVD with over two hours of footage of the band touring in support of the album. As of 2005, They're Only Chasing Safety has sold more than 218,000 copies, with the re-release selling an additional 279,000 copies, making a combined sales of more than 500,000 copies in the US alone.|$|E
5|$|In November 1992, President Yeltsin {{handed the}} two {{recorder}} containers to Korean President Roh Tae-Woo, {{but not the}} tapes themselves. The following month, the ICAO voted to reopen the KAL007 investigation <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the newly released information into account. The tapes were handed to ICAO in Paris on January 8, 1993. Also handed over {{at the same time}} were tapes of the ground to air communications of the Soviet military. The tapes were transcribed by the Bureau d'Enquêtes et d'Analyses pour la sécurité de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) in Paris in the presence of representatives from Japan, The Russian Federation, South Korea, and the United States.|$|E
5|$|In early 1943, {{along with}} the rest of the 9th Division, the {{battalion}} was brought back to Australia <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> part in fighting against the Japanese in the Pacific. This was the final stage in the withdrawal of the 2nd AIF divisions from the Middle East, as the Australian Army's focus had shifted to operations in the Pacific theatre against the Japanese. As part of this process the 6th and 7th Divisions had been brought back to Australia earlier the previous year. Embarking upon the transport Aquitania on 27 January 1943, the battalion sailed as part of a large convoy established as part of Operation Pamphlet; this convoy included the transports Ile de France, Nieuw Amsterdam, and the armed merchant cruiser Queen of Bermuda, and was escorted by HMS Devonshire and several destroyers. The voyage lasted a month, with the troops arriving in Sydney on 27 February.|$|E
50|$|This {{includes}} not performing {{an activity that}} could carry risk. An example would be not buying a property or business <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> not <b>take</b> on the legal liability that comes with it. Another would be not flying <b>in</b> <b>order</b> not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> {{the risk that the}} airplane were to be hijacked. Avoidance may seem the answer to all risks, but avoiding risks also means losing out on the potential gain that accepting (retaining) the risk may have allowed. Not entering a business to avoid the risk of loss also avoids the possibility of earning profits. Increasing risk regulation in hospitals has led to avoidance of treating higher risk conditions, in favor of patients presenting with lower risk.|$|R

5|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the spacecraft's orbit and facilitate maneuvers, sixteen Sun sensors – eight primaries and eight backups – are placed around the spacecraft to calibrate solar direction relative to the orbiter's frame. Two star trackers, digital cameras used to map the position of catalogued stars, provide NASA with full, three-axis knowledge of the spacecraft orientation and attitude. A primary and backup Miniature Inertial Measurement Unit (MIMU), provided by Honeywell, measures changes to the spacecraft attitude as well as any non-gravitationally induced changes to its linear velocity. Each MIMU is a combination of three accelerometers and three ring-laser gyroscopes. These systems are all critically important to MRO, as it must be able to point its camera to a very high precision <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the high-quality pictures that the mission requires. It has also been specifically designed to minimize any vibrations on the spacecraft, so as to allow its instruments to take images without any distortions caused by vibrations.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, 207. Infanteriedivision was for {{the first}} time {{committed}} to battle at the Grebbeberg itself when two battalions of its 322. Infanterieregiment attacked the Stop Line. The first wave of German attackers was beaten back with serious losses, but a second wave managed to fragment the trench line, which then was taken after heavy fighting. The regiment subsequently proceeded to mop up the area to the west, delayed by resistance from several Dutch command posts. It withdrew in the late afternoon, just as the SS battalions further north, to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment, shifted to a more western position. After redeployment the Germans intended to renew their attack <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the Rhenen fall-back line and the village of Achterberg. However, these preparations would prove to be superfluous: the Dutch had already disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Burns sends hired goons to the Simpson house <b>in</b> <b>order</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> Homer back to Mr. Burns' Manor to negotiate. While Mr. Burns {{is setting}} {{the agenda for}} the discussion, Homer is struck by the urgent need to use the rest room. Homer asks Mr. Burns where the rest room is and {{immediately}} leaves, leading Mr. Burns to conclude that Homer is a tough negotiator who is unwilling to even hear him out. At a later union meeting, Homer tries to resign, tired of meeting with Mr. Burns. The union misunderstands his frustration, and the members nearly unanimously decide to strike. Mr. Burns is undeterred by the strike and tries several methods of breaking it up, but fails. On an edition of Kent Brockman's talk show Smartline, Mr. Burns is allowed an opening tirade and he threatens dire events if the strike is not concluded.|$|E
