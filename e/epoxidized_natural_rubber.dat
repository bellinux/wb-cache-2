All the blends were prepared by melt-blending and self-healing behavior was studied in ballistic puncture tests. Self-healing behavior of each material was evaluated by observing the impact zones under a stereo-optical microscope and the micrographic results were further supported by the fluid flow test in the punctured zones. Interestingly, ENR 50 blends of sodium ion containing ionomers exhibited complete self-repairing behavior while zinc ion containing ionomer showed limited mending but EMNa/ENR 25 and EMNa/PISP blends did not show any self-healing behavior following the damage. On the other hand, a composition dependent healing behavior was observed in the EMNa/PVAcE blends where healing was observed up to 30 wt% PVAcE containing blends. The chemical structure studied by FTIR analysis showed that both ion content of ionomer and functionality of ENR have significant influence on the self-repairing behavior of blends.

The degradation mechanism is investigated by many spectroscopic methods, for example, FT-IR and NMR.

The tensile property of unaged and aged ENR vulcanizates was determined by using U-CAN electron tensile testing machine. Results indicate that {{tensile strength}} and elongation at break of unaged ENR 25 and ENR 40 vulcanizates increase gradually with increasing concentration of calcium stearate up to about 1 phr of calcium stearate and after which, the tensile strength and elongation at break drop with a further increase in calcium stearate loading. For a similar alcium stearate concentration, the tensile strength and elongation at break of ENR 40 vulcanizates exhibits a consistently higher value than that of ENR 25 vulcanizates, {{which is due to}} the higher crosslink density of ENR 40 which contains more epoxide groups than ENR 25.

In synthesizing TPNR several routes can be adopted, but with <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> grafting is one of the distinguished route. Practically all methods that have been adopted for the general synthesis of graft copolymers can be used for the synthesis of graft copolymers of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> This paper is intended to give a general idea on methods which can be utilised specifically for the synthesis of well defined and well characterized graft copolymers of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|Constant {{viscosity}} <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> {{has been}} prepared using mercaptan. The accelerated storage tests {{indicate that the}} storage hardening phenomenon of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> can be inhibited by mercaptan. The amount of mercaptan (2 -mercaptobenzothiazole) of 0. 14 phr is sufficient to prepare constant viscosity <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> and the storage hardening numbers of constant viscosity NR in both Mooney viscosity and Wallace plasticity are less than 4. The processing properties and anti-oxidative behavior of CV-NR can be improved, although the mechanical properties of vulcanizates decreased slightly as compared to those of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber.</b> The results further {{support the hypothesis that}} the abnormal groups in <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> molecules are aldehyde groups and are responsible for the hardening of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{development}} of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports and analyze the competitiveness of Indonesian <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in the International market. The data used in this study was a secondary data export raw <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> Indonesia, Thailand, and Malaysia during the period 1996 - 2010. The data was taken from the value and volume of exports of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> in the International market. The analytical method used was the Revealed Comparative Advantage (RCA) and Constant Market Share (CMS). The results of this study indicate that the development of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports tend to increase every year. The level of the comparative advantage of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports relatively higher than Malaysia. Meanwhile during the period 1996 - 2006, the level of the comparative advantage of Indonesia was lower than Thailand. While during the period 2007 - 2010, the level of the comparative advantage of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> is relatively higher than Thailand. This data indicated that Indonesia has a comparative advantage exports of <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> were getting better every year. From the CMS analysis note that the competitiveness of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports more influenced by standard growth and competitiveness effects. This represents an increase of Indonesia 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports more influenced by the growth of the world 2 ̆ 7 s <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> exports. Additionally, Indonesia also exports <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> has high competitiveness due to the excellence of product quality or better price...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{deals with}} {{the investigation of the}} self-healing behavior after ballistic damage of ethylene-methacrylic acid ionomers and theirs blends with <b>epoxidized</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (ENR). The self-healing capability was studied by ballistic puncture tests under different experimental conditions as sample thickness, bullet speed, diameter and shape. Bullet speed ranging from few hundreds meters per second to few km/s were employed. The healing efficiency was evaluated by applying a pressure gradient trough the plates and by checking for possible flow at the damage zone. A morphology analysis of the impact area was made observing all samples by scanning electron microscope...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Thermoplastic {{vulcanizates}} (TPVs) {{based on}} <b>epoxidized</b> <b>natural</b> <b>rubber</b> (ENR) and polypropylene (PP) were prepared in an internal mixer at 180 °C. The effects of curing systems (i. e., sulfur and peroxide) on morphological, rheological, thermal and mechanical properties were studied. It is {{found that the}} sulfur cured TPVs show higher tensile strength, tear strength and elongation at break than those cured with the DCP systems. The rheological analysis indicates that TPVs cured with DCP system show lower apparent shear viscosity than those with sulfur system. SEM studies show that TPVs vulcanized with DCP system exhibit smaller and finely dispersed rubber domains, which provides it higher thermal stability than sulfur cured TPVs...|$|E
