40|$|This two-part article {{addresses}} the “Who?” {{question in the}} hate speech debate: namely, which characteristics, social identities or statuses {{should or should not}} be treated as protected characteristics within a body hate speech laws? Using United Kingdom <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> hatred laws as a focal point, the article outlines and critically appraises five broad approaches to specification. Part 1 deals with consistency specification, which highlights norms of consistency both within <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> hatred law itself and in relation to other laws, practical specification, which focuses on the ostensible goals or apparent aims of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> hatred laws, and formal specification, which looks at the formal qualities of the characteristics themselves and to the different forms of people’s relationships with those characteristics. And Part 2 considers functional specification, which concentrates on the underlying or real functions, purposes or objectives of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> hatred laws, and democratic specification, which appeals to democratic procedures as well as to democratic values, norms and principles that speak to the proper scope of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> hatred laws. Along the way I shall also critically assess a range of substantive arguments about which particular characteristics should or should not be covered by <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> hatred laws given the aforementioned approaches. My main conclusion shall be that each of the approaches has its strengths and weakness and that, partly because of this, no single approach is adequate by itself as a tool for specifying the proper scope of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> hatred laws, but also, by the same token, no approach should be ruled out entirely. Instead, the best strategy is one that combines together all five approaches in reasonable ways given the law, the characteristic and the context...|$|R

40|$|The inchoate {{crime of}} direct and public <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> commit {{genocide}} was first recognised under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (1948). The {{creation of the}} crime was {{a direct result of}} the horrific effects of acts of incitement before and during the Second World War. Today the crime is firmly established under international law and is also criminalised in many domestic legal systems. History shows that <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> crime and violence against a specific group is a precursor to and catalyst for acts of genocide. Consequently, the goal of prevention lies at the core of the prohibition of direct and public <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> genocide. However, it may be said that this preventative objective has thus far been undermined by a general lack of prosecutions of the crime, especially at the domestic level. This prosecutorial void is rather conspicuous in the light of the new vision of international criminal justice under which domestic legal systems (including that of South Africa) bear the primary responsibility for the enforcement of the law of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (Rome Statute), which in Article 25 (3) (e) includes the crime of direct and public <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> commit genocide. This article provides a brief historical and teleological overview of the crime of direct and public <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> commit genocide under international law, as well as the definitional elements thereof as interpreted and applied by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR). Thereafter it examines the criminalisation of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> genocide in contemporary South African law in order to assess South Africa’s capacity <b>to</b> prosecute <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> genocide at the domestic level. In this regard there are, in theory, various 'legal avenues' for the prosecution of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> commit genocide in South Africa, namely: as a crime under the Riotous Assemblies Act 17 of 1956; as a crime under the Implementation of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act 27 of 2002 (the ICC Act); or as a crime under customary international law pursuant to section 232 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa, 1996. The article reflects critically on the viability of prosecuting <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> genocide in terms of each of these alternatives. The article highlights a number of practical and legal problems as regards the prosecution of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> commit genocide under the Riotous Assemblies Act as well as under customary international law. It is argued that the prosecution of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> genocide in terms of the ICC Act is preferable, as this would respond directly to an international consensus as regards the unique and egregious nature of genocide by providing for a limited form of extraterritorial criminal jurisdiction. Prosecution under the ICC Act would also reflect the objectives of the Rome Statute pursuant to which South Africa has certain international legal obligations. However, it is submitted that legislative amendment of the ICC Act is needed, since the crime is not explicitly provided for thereby at present. It is submitted that the legislative amendment must provide for the distinct crime of direct and public <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> genocide in terms of South African criminal law. Such an amendment will remove the existing legal obstacles to the domestic prosecution of <b>incitement</b> <b>to</b> genocide and enable effective prosecution thereof at the domestic level. The proposed amendment will have the effect of strengthening the alignment between South African law and the objectives of the Rome Statute and may have preventative benefits in the long run. ...|$|R
