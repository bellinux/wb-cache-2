40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that since privatization involves the transfer of public ownership to private sector, it thereby reflects a contraction of public administration role in society. Despite the rights and wrongs of this assertion, the 1980 s and 1990 s have witnessed the hegemony of the anti-government political and economic thought. This hegemony has resulted in policies directed mainly toward strengthening the market and reducing the public sector role (In this article the terms public administration, public sector and government are used as synonymous). But not all types of privatization policies affect equally {{the size of the}} public sector. However, the major theoretical contention of this article is that privatization does not necessarily and inevitably leads to reduction in government size or its scope of public administration as measured by the resources put at the <b>disposable</b> <b>of</b> government...|$|E
40|$|In {{comparative}} analysis, we {{know that}} shape of income distribution are variable and broadly related to typesf welfare capitalism. Here, we expand on the socio-economic regimes literature and show almost perfect similarity between varieties of capitalism (VoC) and varieties of distributions (VoD). Utilising a new tool for income analysis, the isograph, and when we consider three stages of distributions by country-period: 'before' taxes and redistributions, 'after' (equivalized <b>disposable</b> <b>of</b> incomes) and the shape of 'effort' between, the empirical clustering of countries are strongly related to what is theoretically known of welfare capitalism. We extend this relation to over 30 countries (LIS datasets) and then compare transformations over time, {{and then to the}} 183 LIS datasets having pre and post transfer incomes. We specifically detect, in particular in the lower percentiles of Nordic countries, but in other countries too, an increasing problem of massive inequality 'before': a strong decline of market incomes {{at the bottom of the}} distribution is balanced by more generous transfers, but the risk is to generate poverty and dependence traps that contradicts the initial concept of the Social-Democratic welfare regime...|$|E

40|$|Groundwater quality {{receives}} increasing {{attention in}} water management in India. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to highlight the emerging issues of groundwater quality in the Ramganga Sub-Basin (RSB), a tributary joining the Ganga River from the northern plains, which extends over 30, 839 Sq. km and covers 15 districts in both Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh. The groundwater in most of the districts of the RSB has high concentration of nitrate, iron, salinity and fluoride, which exceed the standards prescribed for drinking water by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and World Health Organization (WHO). Arsenic contamination in groundwater is an emerging issue in few groundwater development blocks. Moreover, groundwater with substantial hardness, high sulfate, and high manganese is emerging issue in some districts. Additionally, shallow aquifers have high concentration of ions. In the RSB, the quality of groundwater, especially in the shallow aquifers, is influenced by the contamination of poor quality surface water, due mainly to poor sanitation, improper <b>disposable</b> <b>of</b> domestic sewage water, manures and irrigation return flows. To reduce deterioration of water quality further, the RSB requires proper sanitation facilities, efficient usage of agrochemicals, as well as an awareness program of water-related disease...|$|E
40|$|The {{number of}} {{airborne}} bacteria-carrying {{in the operating}} room is considered an indicator of the risk of infections to the patients undergoing surgery susceptible to infections. Today when the supply air {{in the operating room}} is HEPA-filtered, the main source of airborne microorganisms is people (patient and personnel). The filtration efficacy of the fabric in operating clothing systems plays an important role. The design of the clothing system also affects the number of particles emitted from people to the air of the operating room. In operating rooms for surgery susceptible to infections, the selection of clothing systems for the operating personnel should no longer only be considered in terms of comfort but also in terms of patient safety. Today clothing and clothing systems for cleanrooms and associated controlled rooms such as ultraclean operating rooms are mainly tested with regard to material properties, such as particle generation, particle filtration, resistance to wear and comfort. The dispersal chamber or "body-box" has been used for studying the protective efficacy of clothing systems in use. A modified dispersal chamber has been installed at Chalmers University of Technology, Göteborg. Tests and comparative studies have been performed in the dispersal chamber on four selected clothing systems, three <b>disposable</b> <b>of</b> non-woven material and one reusable system of mixed (cotton/polyester) material. The results show clearly that the clothing systems of disposable non-woven material have better protection efficiency than that of mixed material...|$|E
40|$|Background: DOTS is {{the most}} {{effective}} strategy available today for tuberculosis control. Objectives: To fi nd out patients knowledge and opinion about DOTS programme of Nepal. Methods: The prospective study was conducted in tuberculosis patients attending DOTS programme in Nepal. Questionnaires are used to collect patient knowledge and opinion. Results: Tuberculosis was most (73 %) commonly found in economically active age group (21 - 50 years old). The incidence of tuberculosis was found higher in male than in female, most of them were married (55 %). Tuberculosis cases were commonly found in rural areas 59 %, most of them were illiterate 27 % and farmers 23. 6 % respectively. Majority of patients (72 %) family size was large 5 - 7 persons. Knowledge about DOTS programme, majority of the patients (58. 3 %) answered correctly.

40|$|Esta dissertação tem como objeto de análise a tematização da subjetividade masculina afetiva sexual em textos das revistas Universo Masculino e Men&# 8223;s Health. Nosso objetivo central é descrever e interpretar o tema da subjetividade masculina nos discursos de afetividade e sexualidade materializados nas práticas discursivas destas revistas. A {{principal}} questão norteadora da pesquisa é a problematização do modo como a discursividade destas duas revistas possibilita compreender os efeitos de sentido produzidos sobre o masculino na atualidade. Na perspectiva do trajeto temático, aspecto central no tratamento de corpus na pesquisa em análise do discurso francesa, percorremos, nas matérias das revistas, uma arqueogenealogia do masculino, a partir de um dispositivo de afetividade-sexualidade específico de nossa cultura midiática. Nosso percurso analítico permite concluir que o trajeto temático da subjetividade masculina afetiva sexual produz um trajeto semântico que reafirma ideais hegemônicos e heteronormativos, mais do que propõe novas performances nas vivências subjetivas masculinas. Em seus efeitos de verdade, esta prática discursiva midiática busca ligar certos saberes afetivo sexuais aos modos de vida do sujeito masculino na atualidade, a partir de escolhas temáticas, modalidades enunciativas e estratégias discursivas específicas desta mídia masculina. This dissertation has {{the thematic}} {{of the sexual}} affection of the masculine subjectivity within texts of Universo Masculino and Men&# 8223;s Health magazines as object of analysis. The central objective was to describe and interpret the theme on the masculine subjectivity in discourses about the affection of sexuality materialized in discourse practices in those magazines. The main point of the research matters how the discourse structures of texts in those magazines {{make it possible to}} comprehend the meanings produced about the masculinity nowadays. On the perspective of the thematic trajectory what consists the main aspect that concerns the leading of corpus in the research under the French discourse analysis, we have searched, in reports of those magazines, an arch-genealogy of masculinity, from a specific sexual-affection <b>disposable</b> <b>of</b> our mediate culture. The analytic trajectory enables us to conclude that the thematic trajectory about the sexual affection of the masculine subjectivity produces a semantic way that confirms hegemony and hetero-normative ideals, rather than what proposes new performances on the masculine subjectivity experiences. In its real effects, such mediate discourse practice pursues to link certain sexual affection knowledge to the male individual&# 8223;s lifestyle today, from the thematic choices, enunciation modalities and discourse strategies which are specific to the masculine medi...|$|E
