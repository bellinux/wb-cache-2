25|$|One {{specific}} cause Clinton advocated {{almost from}} the start of her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women. In September 2010, she announced a partnership with the United Nations Foundation to provide some 100million such stoves around the world within the next ten years, and in subsequent travels she urged foreign leaders to adopt policies encouraging their use.|$|E

If solar power {{is used as}} a heat source, regular solar mirrors and solar dishes may be utilised. The use of Fresnel lenses and mirrors has also been advocated, for example in planetary surface exploration. Solar powered Stirling engines are increasingly popular as they offer an <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> option for producing power while some designs are economically attractive in development projects.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{challenge}} the assumptions prominent in the Anglo-American context that the objective of a business is to increase its profits or/and that managers have to make 'the business case' in order to implement <b>environmentally</b> <b>sounder</b> solutions or other sustainability considerations into their business decisions. The paper argues that these assumptions are not presented as a human construction or agreement, instead they are treated as though they are a given, a prerequisite to a business system. By comparing qualitative statements in a cross-cultural study the paper highlights different ways in which economic rationality could be conceptualised...|$|R

40|$|Policy {{initiatives}} have highlighted {{the importance of}} environmental innovations {{as a solution to}} environmental problems, and looked into ways to promote them. Based on empirical cases in the Nordic pulp and paper industry, this report explores <b>environmentally</b> <b>sounder</b> technological innovations and their relation to societal and economic drivers. The cases studied include the use of production by-products for energy, new products in the core business areas and new product value chains. The report shows that public policy has directly influenced environmental innovation in the P&P industry through providing public R&D support, funding development projects and encouraging cooperation. It has also facilitated the crucial stage of demonstration by creating or enforcing markets for environmental innovations. The success of policy-created markets in supporting innovation is, however, crucially dependent on other market changes that push the development towards improved environmental performance. Environmental policies alone are seldom sufficient drivers for innovations...|$|R
25|$|Collocation of a waste {{generator}} with a waste-to-ethanol plant {{can reduce the}} waste producer's operating cost, while creating a more-profitable ethanol production business. This innovative collocation concept is sometimes called holistic systems engineering. Collocation disposal elimination {{may be one of}} the few cost-effective, <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound,</b> biofuel strategies, but its scalability is limited by availability of appropriate waste generation sources. For example, millions of tons of wet Florida-and-California citrus peels cannot supply billions of gallons of biofuels. Due to the higher cost of transporting ethanol, it is a local partial solution, at best.|$|E

25|$|Tourism {{became a}} major industry, {{especially}} in the Myrtle Beach area. With its semitropical climate, cheap land and low construction costs (because of low wages), the state became a developer's dream. Barrier islands, such as Kiawah and Hilton Head, were developed as retirement communities for wealthy outsiders. The state's attempts to manage coastal development in an orderly and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> manner have run afoul of federal court decisions. The U.S. Supreme Court (in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council) ruled that the state, in forbidding construction on threatened beachfront property, had, in effect, seized the plaintiff's property without due process of law. The rush to build upscale housing along the coast paid its price in {{the billions of dollars}} of losses as Hurricane Hugo swept through on September 21–22, 1989. Charleston was more used to hurricanes; historical preservation groups immediately stepped in to begin salvage and reconstruction, with the result that one year after Hugo, the city was virtually returned to normal.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 {{the state}} of New York {{introduced}} a green building tax credit, the first one {{of its kind in}} the United States, that has allowed some developers of environmentally friendly buildings to write off as much as $6 million on their tax bill. The city's Department of Design and Construction developed a set of guidelines in 1999 that encourage <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> building methods for municipal projects. The guidelines had led to approximately $700 million in green city construction projects by the end of 2005. In 2005, New York City mandated that nonresidential public buildings costing $2 million or more be built to standards set by Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED), which grade buildings in areas like energy and water consumption, indoor air quality and use of renewable materials. The legislation also applies to private projects that receive $10 million or more in public funds or half of whose budgets come from public money.|$|E

500|$|Clinton {{spent her}} initial days as Secretary of State telephoning dozens of world leaders and {{indicating}} that U.S. foreign policy would change direction: [...] "We {{have a lot}} of damage to repair." [...] She advocated an expanded role in global economic issues for the State Department and cited the need for an increased U.S. diplomatic presence, especially in Iraq where the Defense Department had conducted diplomatic missions. Clinton announced the most ambitious of her departmental reforms, the Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review, which establishes specific objectives for the State Department's diplomatic missions abroad; it was modeled after a similar process in the Defense Department that she was familiar with from her time on the Senate Armed Services Committee. The first such review was issued in late 2010 and called for the U.S. leading through [...] "civilian power" [...] as a cost-effective way of responding to international challenges and defusing crises. It also sought to institutionalize goals of empowering women throughout the world. A cause Clinton advocated throughout her tenure was the adoption of cookstoves in the developing world, to foster cleaner and more <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> food preparation and reduce smoke dangers to women.|$|E
500|$|A Tulsa-area {{supervisor}} {{with the}} U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) commented upon environmental issues {{pertaining to the}} Creek Turnpike in a 19-page letter to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dated February 9, 1990. USACE was responsible for issuing three essential permits (which OTA had applied for on November 6, 1989) that would allow construction to continue, and was required to consider input from the service. In the letter, supervisor Stephen Forsythe recommended that the permits be denied and further studies conducted into alternate routes for the turnpike and the environmental impact on roads that connected to the turnpike. However, USACE only {{had the authority to}} review the impacts the Creek Turnpike itself made on wetland areas. Governor Bellmon publicly criticized Forsythe for focusing on concerns beyond USACE's jurisdiction. Bellmon's Transportation Secretary, Neal McCaleb, publicly stated [...] "I think [...] is out of line and would say so to Mr. Forsythe." [...] Bellmon and McCaleb discussed the letter in a private meeting with the Secretary of the Interior, Manuel Lujan, although Lujan neither commented nor committed to any action regarding the letter. In response to Bellmon's criticism of the letter, Tulsans Against Turnpikes issued a public statement, saying [...] "Running behind closed political doors like that demonstrates the governor is an environmental hypocrite," [...] contrasting his statements with a letter he wrote assuring a constituent in Jenks that the project would be [...] "the most aesthetically pleasing and <b>environmentally</b> <b>sound</b> facility that can be constructed".|$|E

40|$|Agriculture {{is one of}} {{the main}} drivers of {{biodiversity}} loss as a result of the intensification of cultivation practices and the transformation of natural habitats into farmed areas. Intensified production achieved through the use of agrochemicals has had a detrimental effect on ground flora and insect population, reducing their numbers and diversification, which in turn has led to a reduction of food accessible to mammals, reptiles and birds and, thus, has had a negative impact on habitats and wildlife present on the cultivated land. This trend has also been observed in Italian olive production. Olive culture is of particular interest considering it is home of biodiversity rich habitats when plants are cultivated with traditional methods. Further, it accounts for the third largest land use in Italian agriculture. One of the tools available to governments in order to reduce negative impacts is to integrate environmental concerns into agricultural policies. However, top-down governance does not portray the full spectrum of tools implemented in order to steer producers towards more <b>environmentally</b> <b>sounds</b> practices. Different types of strategies ranging from economical to informational and organizational have been implemented and other actors, such as retailers, consumers or non-governmental organizations, have developed different tools in this regard. The goal of this research will be to compare different biodiversity integration strategies and evaluate their contribution to reducing the use of agrochemicals that have proven to have a negative impact on biodiversity...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} {{impacts of}} climate change on existing coastal hazards are likely to increase. During this century our coastline {{is likely to be}} impacted by climate change. Impacts such as sea level rise and an increase in frequency and severity of storm events are likely to lead to a greater coastal inundation and erosion. Hard approach protection has been used despite the expensive cost and less environmentally friendly. It is necessary to develop an eco-protection concept using vegetation or combination of vegetation with civil structures. Combined model is likely to be cheaper and is <b>environmentally</b> <b>sounder.</b> This paper presents the results of experimental research on the performance of mangroves as shore protection (Thaha, 2003) combined with a low crested rubble mount breakwater by Seabrook & Hall (1998) in Pilarczyk KW et al. (2003). The results showed a maximum wave transmission can be reduce 48 % up to 85 % for tidal ranges of 2. 00 m for a 50 m width of composite structures with mangrove relative roots density in the range of 0. 009 to 0. 073. The increase of transmitted wave height throught the LB-BW (without mangroves) due to the sea level rise can be reduced by combining it with mangrove forests where the mangrove wave damping capacity will increase by the growing of mangrove roots density. The combined equation of wave transmission coefficients consisting of both mangrove roots and low crest breakwater parameter is presented {{at the end of this}} paper...|$|R
