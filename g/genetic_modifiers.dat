5|$|Most {{cases of}} Alzheimer's disease do not exhibit autosomal-dominant {{inheritance}} and are termed sporadic AD, in which environmental and genetic differences may act as risk factors. The best known genetic risk {{factor is the}} inheritance of the ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE). Between 40 and 80% of people with AD possess at least one APOEε4 allele. The APOEε4 allele {{increases the risk of}} the disease by three times in heterozygotes and by 15 times in homozygotes. Like many human diseases, environmental effects and <b>genetic</b> <b>modifiers</b> result in incomplete penetrance. For example, certain Nigerian populations do not show the relationship between dose of APOEε4 and incidence or age-of-onset for Alzheimer's disease seen in other human populations. Early attempts to screen up to 400 candidate genes for association with late-onset sporadic AD (LOAD) resulted in a low yield. More recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have found 19 areas in genes that appear to affect the risk. These genes include: CASS4, CELF1, FERMT2, HLA-DRB5, INPP5D, MEF2C, NME8, PTK2B, SORL1, ZCWPW1, SlC24A4, CLU, PICALM, CR1, BIN1, MS4A, ABCA7, EPHA1, and CD2AP.|$|E

40|$|Endogenous retroviruses and retrotransposons {{contribute}} functional {{genetic variation}} in animal genomes. In mice, Intracisternal A Particles (IAPs) are a frequent source of both new mutations and polymorphism across laboratory strains. Intronic IAPs can induce alternative RNA processing choices, including alternative splicing. We previously showed IAP I∆ 1 subfamily insertional mutations are suppressed by a wild-derived allele {{of the major}} mRNA export factor, Nxf 1. Here we show that a wider diversity of IAP insertions present in the mouse reference sequence induce insertion-dependent alternative processing that is suppressed by Nxf 1 CAST alleles. These insertions typically show more modest gene expression changes than de novo mutations, suggesting selection or attenuation. Genome-wide splicing-sensitive microarrays and gene-focused assays confirm specificity of Nxf 1 <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> activity for IAP insertion alleles. Strikingly, CRISPR/Cas 9 -mediated genome editing demonstrates that a single amino acid substitution in Nxf 1, E 610 G, is sufficient to recreate a quantitative <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> in a co-isogenic background...|$|R

40|$|The Notch {{receptor}} is {{the central}} element in a cell signaling mechanism controlling {{a broad spectrum of}} cell fate choices. <b>Genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> screens in Drosophila and subsequent molecular studies have identified several Notch pathway components, but the biochemical nature of signaling is still elusive. Here, we report the results of a <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> screen of the bristle phenotype of a gain-of-function Notch allele, Abruptex 16. Abruptex mutations interfere with lateral inhibition/specification events that control the segregation of epidermal and sensory organ precursor lineages, thus inhibiting bristle formation. Mutations that reduce Notch signaling suppress this phenotype. This screen of approximately 50, 000 flies led to the identification of a small number of dominant suppressors in seven complementation groups. These include known components in the pathway, Notch, mastermind, Delta, and Hairless, as well as two novel mutations. The first, A 122, appears to interact with Notch only during bristle development. The other, M 285, displays extensive genetic interactions with the Notch pathway elements and appears, in general, capable of suppressing Notch gain-of-function phenotypes while enhancing Notch loss-of-function phenotypes, suggesting that it {{plays an important role in}} Notch signaling...|$|R

50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that ALP is present at {{the first stage of}} myofibrilogenesis where it is bound to alpha actinin-2, and this {{association}} remains intact in mature myofibrils where ALP is localized to Z-discs and intercalated discs. Alpha actinin-2 is however not required for targeting ALP to Z-lines. Studies in ALP knockout mice {{have shown that}} ALP facilitates the cross-linking of actin filaments by alpha actinin-2, and absence of ALP induces abnormal right ventricular chamber formation, dysplasia and cardiomyopathy. Further studies using right ventricular epicardial systolic strain and geometric remodeling analysis in these animals unveiled that absence of ALP diminishes right ventricular contractile function and alters the pattern of cardiac hypertrophic remodeling.

Knowledge of such <b>genetic</b> <b>modifiers</b> offers novel therapeutic targets and improved understanding of the pathways involved in the disease process. Our method integrates different data types to identify genes that have a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) disrupting a transcription factor binding site that modifies the outcome of BIPF.

40|$|Huntington's disease (HD) is a fatal {{neurodegenerative}} condition {{caused by}} {{expansion of the}} polyglutamine tract in the huntingtin (Htt) protein. Neuronal toxicity in HD is thought to be, at least in part, a consequence of protein interactions involving mutant Htt. We therefore hypothesized that <b>genetic</b> <b>modifiers</b> of HD neurodegeneration should be enriched among Htt protein interactors. To test this idea, we identified a comprehensive set of Htt interactors using two complementary approaches: high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity pull down followed by mass spectrometry. This effort led to the identification of 234 high-confidence Htt-associated proteins, 104 of which were found with the yeast method and 130 with the pull downs. We then tested an arbitrary set of 60 genes encoding interacting proteins {{for their ability to}} behave as <b>genetic</b> <b>modifiers</b> of neurodegeneration in a Drosophila model of HD. This high-content validation assay showed that 27 of 60 orthologs tested were high-confidence <b>genetic</b> <b>modifiers,</b> as modification was observed with more than one allele. The 45 % hit rate for <b>genetic</b> <b>modifiers</b> seen among the interactors is an order of magnitude higher than the 1 %- 4 % typically observed in unbiased genetic screens. <b>Genetic</b> <b>modifiers</b> were similarly represented among proteins discovered using yeast two-hybrid and pull-down/mass spectrometry methods, supporting the notion that these complementary technologies are equally useful in identifying biologically relevant proteins. Interacting proteins confirmed as modifiers of the neurodegeneration phenotype represent a diverse array of biological functions, including synaptic transmission, cytoskeletal organization, signal transduction, and transcription. Among the modifiers were 17 loss-of-function suppressors of neurodegeneration, which can be considered potential targets for therapeutic intervention. Finally, we show that seven interacting proteins from among 11 tested were able to co-immunoprecipitate with full-length Htt from mouse brain. These studies demonstrate that high-throughput screening for protein interactions combined with genetic validation in a model organism is a powerful approach for identifying novel candidate modifiers of polyglutamine toxicity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{development}} of COPD {{in subjects with}} alpha- 1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency {{is likely to be}} influenced by modifier genes. Genome-wide association studies and integrative genomics approaches in COPD have demonstrated significant associations with SNPs in the chromosome 15 q region that includes CHRNA 3 (cholinergic nicotine receptor alpha 3) and IREB 2 (iron regulatory binding protein 2). We investigated whether SNPs in the chromosome 15 q region would be modifiers for lung function and COPD in AAT deficiency. Methods The current analysis included 378 PIZZ subjects in the AAT <b>Genetic</b> <b>Modifiers</b> Study and a replication cohort of 458 subjects from the UK AAT Deficiency National Registry. Nine SNPs in LOC 123688, CHRNA 3 and IREB 2 were selected for genotyping. FEV 1 percent of predicted and FEV 1 /FVC ratio were analyzed as quantitative phenotypes. Family-based association analysis was performed in the AAT <b>Genetic</b> <b>Modifiers</b> Study. In the replication set, general linear models were used for quantitative phenotypes and logistic regression models were used for the presence/absence of emphysema or COPD. Results Three SNPs (rs 2568494 in IREB 2, rs 8034191 in LOC 123688, and rs 1051730 in CHRNA 3) were associated with pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent of predicted in the AAT <b>Genetic</b> <b>Modifiers</b> Study. Two SNPs (rs 2568494 and rs 1051730) were associated with the post-bronchodilator FEV 1 percent of predicted and pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio; SNP-by-gender interactions were observed. In the UK National Registry dataset, rs 2568494 was significantly associated with emphysema in the male subgroup; significant SNP-by-smoking interactions were observed. Conclusions IREB 2 and CHRNA 3 are potential <b>genetic</b> <b>modifiers</b> of COPD phenotypes in individuals with severe AAT deficiency and may be sex-specific in their impact. </p...|$|E

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} (CNS) hemangioblastomas are highly-vascularized tumors {{occurring}} in sporadic form or as {{a manifestation of}} von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL). The VHL protein (pVHL) regulates various target genes, one of which is the CCND 1 gene, encoding cyclin D 1, a protein that plays a critical role in the control of the cell cycle. Overexpression of cyclin D 1 is found in many cancers. The CCND 1 gene contains a common G [...] > A polymorphism (870 G > A) that enhances alternative splicing of the gene. CCND 1 genotype is associated with clinical outcome in a number of cancers although prognostic significance varies with tumor type. In VHL disease, CCND 1 genotype has been suggested as a <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> that influences susceptibility to hemangioblastomas. In order to analyze whether CCND 1 genotype plays a role in sporadic CNS hemangioblastomas, we investigated CCND 1 genotype in tumor tissue of 17 sporadic and also in five VHL-related CNS hemangioblastomas. In addition, in these tumors the extent and localization of cyclin D 1 expression was investigated by immunohistochemistry. We found no deviation in CCND 1 genotype distribution and allele frequencies from expected values. Also, there was no correlation between age at onset and CCND 1 genotype. The expression of cyclin D 1 as detected by immunohistochemistry was highly variable within and between tumors, without a clear correlation with CCND 1 genotype. We conclude that, whereas variable but sometimes high cyclin D 1 expression is a feature of sporadic hemangioblastomas, CCND 1 genotype is unlikely to be an important <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> in the oncogenesis of these tumors...|$|R

Genetic variants at TMEM 106 B influence risk for the most common neuropathological subtype of FTLD, characterized by inclusions of TAR DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (FTLD-TDP). Previous reports have shown that TMEM 106 B is a <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> of FTLD-TDP caused by progranulin (GRN) mutations, with the major (risk) allele of rs 1990622 associating with earlier age at onset of disease. Here we report that rs 1990622 genotype affects age at death in a single-site discovery cohort of FTLD patients with C 9 orf 72 expansions (n= 14), with the major allele correlated with later age at death (p= 0. 024). We replicate this modifier effect in a 30 -site international neuropathological cohort of FTLD-TDP patients with C 9 orf 72 expansions (n= 75), again finding that the major allele associates with later age at death (p= 0. 016), as well as later age at onset (p= 0. 019). In contrast, TMEM 106 B genotype does not affect age at onset or death in 241 FTLD-TDP cases negative for GRN mutations or C 9 orf 72 expansions. Thus, TMEM 106 B is a <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> of FTLD with C 9 orf 72 expansions. Intriguingly, the genotype that confers increased risk for developing FTLD-TDP (major, or T, allele of rs 1990622) is associated with later age at onset and death in C 9 orf 72 expansion carriers, providing an example of sign epistasis in human neurodegenerative disease...|$|R

40|$|ObjectivesWe {{investigated}} {{the role of}} nitric oxide 1 adaptor protein (NOS 1 AP) as a <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> of long QT syndrome (LQTS). BackgroundLQTS risk stratification {{is complicated by the}} phenotype variability that limits prediction of life-threatening arrhythmic events based on available metrics. Thus, the identification of new markers is desirable. Recent studies have shown that NOS 1 APvariations in the gene modulate QT interval in healthy and 1 LQTS kindred, and occurrence of cardiac events in healthy subjects. MethodsThe study included 901 patients enrolled in a prospective LQTS registry. Three NOS 1 APmarker SNPs (rs 4657139, rs 16847548, and rs 10494366) were genotyped to assess the effect of variant alleles on QTc and on the incidence of cardiac events. We quantified the association between variant alleles, QTc, and outcomes to assess whether NOS 1 APis a useful risk stratifier in LQTS. ResultsVariant alleles tagged by SNPs rs 4657139 and rs 16847548 were associated with an average QTc prolongation of 7 and 8 ms, respectively (p < 0. 05; p < 0. 01); whereas rs 4657139 and rs 10494366 were associated with increased incidence of cardiac events (25. 2 % vs. 18. 0 %, p < 0. 05 and 24. 8 % vs. 17. 8 % p < 0. 05). Cox multivariate analysis identified rs 10494366 minor allele as an independent prognostic marker among patients with QTc < 500 ms (hazard ratio: 1. 63; 95 % confidence interval: 1. 06 to 2. 5; p < 0. 05) but not in the entire cohort. ConclusionsOur results provide the first demonstration, to our knowledge, of a risk-conferring <b>genetic</b> <b>modifier</b> in a large LQTS cohort. Subject to confirmation in additional cohorts, we suggest that the NOS 1 APtag SNP genotype may provide an additional clinical dimension, which helps assess risk and choice of therapeutic strategies in LQTS...|$|R
