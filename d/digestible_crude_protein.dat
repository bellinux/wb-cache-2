This is the report of some experiments successively made on the feeding values of beet top silage, sun-cured beet tops, beet pulp silage and beet pulp. The results obtained are summarized as follows: 1) The beet top silage made without any additive had a good value of pH 3. 7, and contained 3. 6 per cent lactic acid and 0 per cent butyric acid. Pro-vitamin A content of the beet top silage was 1 - 2 mg. per 100 g. The silage was found to be a favourite feed with live-stock. Beet top silage contained 544 mg. oxalic acid per 100 g. The nutrient loss in fermentation process was 24 per cent in organic matter and 9 per cent in crude protein. The results of digestion experimets on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 78 per cent; the <b>digestible</b> <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> was 2 per cent and the total digestible nutrient 10. 4 per cent(cf. Table 9). 2) The beet tops lost 24 per cent of organic matter, 17 per cent of crude protein and 86 per cent of carotene during 10 days of sun-curing. The results of digestion experiments on rabbits showed that the digestibility coefficient of organic matter was 66 per cent, lower than that of fresh beet tops or beet top silage. The sun-cured beet tops were less palatable to rabbits than the fresh beet tops or the beet top silage. The contents of <b>digestible</b> <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> and total digestible nutrient were 8. 4 per cent and 42. 0 per cent respectively. 3) A good silage was able to be prepared from beet pulp. Furthermore, addition of morea in silage-making with the beet pulp was effective and the morea added silage was palatable to live-stock; it had the following properties: pH 4. 15, lactic acid 1. 89 per cent. acetic acid 0. 25 per cent and butyric acid 0 per cent.

Semi-natural grass is based on a station in the area of Zdarske Vrchy.

The soil of the experimental area was classified as distroferric Red Latosol (Oxisol). The experimental design was in randomized blocks, in a factorial scheme (4 × 4), with five replications.

40|$|We {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} fertilization with 0, 50, 100 and 200 kg/ha of N, applied in each four growth intervals in the winter/spring season on dry matter yield in 30 days (DMY), leaf chlorophyll index (LCI) and total <b>digestible</b> nutrients (TDN), <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> (CP), neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF) and lignin contents, and correlation equations of LCI with DMY and CP content in the marandu and ruziziensis grasses after intercrop arrangements with corn in Red Latosol (Oxisol) under irrigation. The major DMY occurred with photoperiod increasing, however, there were different responses to this attribute over of growth intervals, between and among the grasses with the N fertilization. In irrigated croplivestock integration under savannah soil is technicality viable the cultivation of marandu and ruziziensis grasses, established by intercrop with corn at sowing or at the N fertilization.

However, after the corn harvest, the N fertilization increase the DMY and improves the chemical composition, increasing the LCI, and CP and TDN contents, and decreasing NDF and ADF contents in the winter/spring season.

It deals with a requirement of the energy, individual nutrients, minerals and vitamins. Also it deals with a technology of the feeding horses at each period of the training. The own work is interested in classification of the intake of the energy and amount of the nutrients in the feeding rations at the season of the training, season of the races and at time of the rest in the winter. The feeding rations are assessed {{in a group of}} nine horses of the various breeds, age, weight and performance.

40|$|The {{historical}} background to protein feeding {{standards in the}} UK and the shortcomings of <b>digestible</b> <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> and available protein as standards for the future are considered. The proposed ARC protein system, which takes into account contributions from microbial protein and dietary protein undegraded in the rumen, and the derivation of the three linear equations necessary for computation of the protein requirements is explained. The system is of particular value in predicting the situations in which non-protein N can be successfully used. The method of computing standards for the pre-ruminant calf is also presented, {{as well as some}} aspects of the contribution of microbial protein to tissue protein needs in relation to metabolisability of the gross energy of the diet and to breed size.

40|$|The {{energy and}} protein value for Guinea pigs (GP) of 9 forages (7 dicots and 2 grasses) and 5 hay-based diets was determined. The {{apparent}} faecal digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and energy was measured on GP housed in metabolic cages. The forages and the diets were digested in vitro using pepsin and pancreatin hydrolysis and gas fermentation test to simulate stomach, small intestine and large intestine, respectively. Most of the dicots had high <b>digestible</b> <b>crude</b> <b>protein</b> content (152 – 201 g/kg DM) and the 2 grasses showed lower values (80 – 85 g/kg DM). Digestible energy {{content of the}} forages ranged between 5. 79 to 13. 08 MJ/kg DM. None of the forage species or hay-based diets provided sufficient energy to supply the 11. 7 MJ/kg metabolic energy requirements. The influence of intestinal fermentation on energy and protein values was highlighted by correlations (P< 0. 05) between in vivo and in vitro data, including gas fermentation.

As rações, à base de milho e farelo de soja, foram isolisinas, isocálcicas e isofosfóricas. O delineamento experimental foi o de blocos ao acaso, com quatro tratamentos em esquema fatorial 2 x 2, com dois níveis de LRSD (7 % ou 14 %) e duas formas físicas das rações (farelada ou peletizada) com quatro repetições e nove animais por unidade experimental. Não foram observados efeitos dos níveis de LRSD nas rações sobre o consumo diário de ração, ganho diário de peso, conversão alimentar e custo da ração por quilograma de ganho de peso vivo. As rações peletizadas proporcionaram maior ganho de peso, redução no consumo diário de ração, melhora na conversão alimentar, redução no custo em ração do quilograma de peso vivo ganho e reduziram o consumo diário e o consumo por quilograma de peso vivo ganho, de energia digestível, proteína bruta, lisina e metionina+cistina.

Isolysine, isocalcic and isophosphoric diets were used, based on corn and soybean meal. The experimental design was of randomized blocks, with four treatments in 2 x 2 factorial scheme, using two SCYSD inclusion levels (7 % and 14 %) and two physical forms of diets (meal and pelleted) with four replications and nine animals per experimental unit. There were no effects of SCYSD inclusion levels in diets on feed intake, daily weight gain and feed/gain ratio or on cost of feed per kilogram of live weight gain.
