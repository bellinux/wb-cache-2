500|$|Originally, the Tabqa Dam was {{conceived}} as a dual-purpose dam. The dam would include a hydroelectric power station with eight turbines capable of producing 824MW in total, and would irrigate an area of [...] {{on both sides of}} the Euphrates. Construction of the dam lasted between 1968 and 1973, while the accompanying power station was finished in 1977. Total cost of the dam was US$340million of which US$100million was in the form of a loan by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union also provided technical expertise. [...] During construction, up to 12thousand Syrians and 900 Russian technicians worked on the dam. They were housed in the greatly <b>expanded</b> <b>town</b> near the construction site, which was subsequently renamed Al-Thawra. To facilitate this project, as well as the construction of irrigation works on the Khabur River, the national railway system (Chemins de Fer Syriens) was extended from Aleppo to the dam, Raqqa, Deir ez-Zor, and eventually Qamishli. The fourthousand-some Arab families who had been living in the flooded part of the Euphrates Valley were resettled in other parts of northern Syria. This resettlement was part of an only partially implemented plan to establish an [...] "Arab belt" [...] along the borders with Turkey and Iraq in order to separate Kurds living in Syria from Kurds living in Turkey and Iraq.|$|E
