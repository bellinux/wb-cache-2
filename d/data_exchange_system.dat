40|$|This demo {{shows how}} usage {{information}} buried in query logs {{can play a}} central role in data integration and <b>data</b> <b>exchange.</b> More specifically, our system U-Map uses query logs to generate correspondences between the attributes of two different schemas and the complex mapping rules to transform and restructure data records from one of these schemas to another.

40|$|The {{notion of}} {{representation}} systems describes structures that are algebraically closed under queries. It {{has recently been}} realized that representation systems are highly relevant also {{in the context of}} <b>data</b> <b>exchange.</b> We extend the notion of representation <b>system</b> to encompass <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> map-pings and their composition. Seen through this lens, two major classes of representation systems emerge, namely ho-momorphic <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> and strong <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems.</b> The homomorphic “OWA ” systems encompass the “classical ” part of <b>data</b> <b>exchange.</b> Reasoning is modulo ho-momorphic equivalence (CQ-equivalence), and only unions of conjunctive queries and monotone <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> map-pings are supported. We then develop some new technical tools that allow us to prove that there is a class of ‘”CWA ” strong representation systems in which reasoning is modulo isomorphic equiva-lence. These systems are based on conditional tables, and they support first order queries and non-monotonic data ex-change mappings specified by a large class of second or-der dependencies. We achieve this by showing that, un-der a CWA-interpretation, conditional tables are chaseable with the aforementioned class of second order dependencies, and that the class is closed under composition in the CWA-setting. We also introduce a stricter notion of composability, and show that the class of (first order) source-to-target tuple generating dependencies is closed under the stricter notion of composability...|$|R

We {{present a}} {{semantics}} and answer set programs for relational peer <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems.</b> When a peer answers a query, it <b>exchanges</b> <b>data</b> with other peers {{in order to}} supplement or modify its own data source. The <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> relationships between peers are specified by logical sentences called <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> constraints and trust relationships, which together determine how data is moved around (in order to keep them satisfied). This process determines virtual, alternative instances for a peer that can be specified as the models of an answer set program. The peer consistent answers to a query that are returned by a peer {{are those that are}} invariant under all these instances. The logic program can be used to compute peer consistent answers. ...|$|R

We propose and {{investigate}} a semantics for peer <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> (or peer <b>data</b> management systems) where different peers are pairwise {{related to each}} other by means of <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> constraints and trust relationships. These two elements plus the data at the peers’ sites and the local integrity constraints for a peer are made compatible via the proposed semantics by determining a set of solution instances, which are the intended virtual instances for the peer. The semantically correct answers from a peer to a query, called its peer consistent answers, are defined as those answers that are invariant under all its different solution instances. We show that solution instances can be specified as the models of logic programs with a stable model semantics. ...|$|R

50|$|With a {{postdoctoral}} student, Polly Wheeler, Ninio {{developed a}} three-layer taxonomy and coding system of verbal-communicative acts in mother-infant interaction, distinguishing speech acts, talk interchanges, and discourse functions. The taxonomy {{was built on}} the theoretical writings of Speech Act theorists such as John Searle and sociologists such as Erving Goffman, as well as on mothers' descriptions of videotaped interaction sessions in which they had participated. An abridged version of it (Inventory of Communicative Acts-Abridged, INCA-A), was prepared by Ninio for use by Catherine Snow, Barbara Pan, and colleagues at Harvard University in the research project “Foundations for Language Assessment in Spontaneous Speech” funded by the National Institutes of Health. The abridged version has been adopted as the official communicative coding system of the Child Language <b>Data</b> <b>Exchange</b> <b>System</b> (CHILDES) project. INCA-A has the same speech act codes but a less detailed repertoire of talk interchange codes than the full Ninio and Wheeler version. Both versions of the Ninio and Wheeler system are widely used in projects on English as well as Hebrew, Dutch, German, Irish, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, Romanian, Turkish, Japanese, Korean, Mandarin Chinese, and others. They are also used in research involving young adults, second language learners, peer conversations, children in the Head Start program, aphasics, autistic children, visually impaired children, and more.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. <b>Data</b> <b>exchange</b> is {{concerned}} with the transfer of data between databases with dif-ferent schemas, whereby certain integrity constraints have to be observed. Given a source database, a target database fulfilling all the integrity constraints is called a ”solution ” to the <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> problem. In general, a source database admits a big number of solutions, which may significantly differ in size. The most compact one among the most general (universal) solutions is called the core. Fagin et al. gave convincing arguments that, in many cases, the core is the pre-ferred solution to a <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> problem. Moreover, Gottlob and Nash showed that the core can be computed in polynomial time under very general conditions. Nevertheless, core computation has not yet been incorporated into existing <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> tools. The aim {{of this paper is to}} address the principal obstacles to the practical feasibility of core computation and to make a big step forward towards the integration of core computation into <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems.</b> 1 Technische Universität Wie...|$|R

40|$|<b>Data</b> <b>exchange</b> is {{the process}} of {{converting}} an instance of one schema into an instance of a different schema according to a given specification. Recent <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> have largely dealt with the case where the schemas are given a priori and transformations can only migrate data from the first schema to an instance of the second schema. In particular, the ability to perform data-metadata translations, transformation in which data is converted into metadata or metadata is converted into data, is largely ignored. This paper provides a systematic study of the <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> problem with data-metadata translation capabilities. We describe the problem, our solution, implementation and experiments. Our solution is a principled and systematic extension of the existing <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> framework; {{all the way from the}} constructs required in the visual interface to specify data-metadata correspondences, which naturally extend the traditional value correspondences, to constructs required for the mapping language to specify data-metadata translations, and algorithms required for generating mappings and queries that perform the exchange. 1...|$|R

40|$|Flexible and {{high-performance}} <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> {{is becoming}} increasingly important. This trend {{is due in part}} to the growing interest among high-performance researchers in tool- and component-based approaches to software development. In trying to reap the well-known benefits of these approaches, the question of what communications infrastructure should be used to link the various application components arises. Traditional HPC-style communication libraries such as MPI offer good performance, but are not intended for loosely-coupled systems. Object- and metadata-based approaches like XML offer the needed plug-and-play flexibility, but with significantly lower performance. We observe that the flexibility and baseline performance of <b>data</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>systems</b> are strongly determined by their "wire formants," or by how they represent data for transmission in the heterogeneous environments.
