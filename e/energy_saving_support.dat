Existing ubiquitous computing systems, which aim at helping people to save energy, usually give feedback about their users energy consumption. But these systems do not take into account age or gender of the users coming with different attitudes and motivation. Since we are considering user awareness as important factor for the success of pervasive <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>support</b> systems, we are going to develop a system on our own. In this paper, we investigate what requirements our system must meet and how it should be designed. We explore peoples knowledge about energy efficiency and the motivation to save energy. Then, we investigate the impact of age on these aspects. The target g roups are female, divided into two age groups ranging from 13 to 15 years and 23 to 30 years. Finally, we draw conclusions how to design our user-adaptive <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> <b>support</b> system...|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that these standards have saved American taxpayers over $300 Billion in <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> Overall these standards have reduced total American energy use by 3.6%, or about 3.6 quadrillion BTU"s every year. Due to the fact that Americans have billions of more dollars every year to reinvest into other sectors of the economy, which they otherwise would not have had without these standards, millions of jobs have been created. It is estimated that these <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> <b>supported</b> 340,000 American jobs in 2010. The electricity industry does not support a lot of jobs compared to the amount of revenue it takes in. So, when people reinvest their <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> into other sectors of the economy that support more jobs per dollar of revenue, jobs are created. These 340,000 jobs created by energy standards represent 0.2% of American jobs a small but beneficial percentage.|$|R
40|$|The UK is in {{the process}} of {{implementing}} the Green Deal, a finance-based energy efficiency policy. It is aimed, initially, at the domestic sector, but with plans to extend the scheme to the commercial and public sectors. The Green Deal represents a fundamental reorganisation of policy because it places a considerable reliance on the role of markets to deliver the required <b>energy</b> <b>savings.</b> <b>Support</b> programmes have been curtailed or removed completely and role of government restricted to capacity building, accreditation and compliance monitoring. Will the Green Deal succeed? This paper reviews the history of energy efficiency policy and programmes in the UK from 1973 to the present day, taking account of the political environment and of the wider context of energy and climate policy development. This information is then analysed to draw out what is generally considered to be effective policy, and applies this to the current policy landscape. </p...|$|R

40|$|<b>Energy</b> <b>savings</b> in {{the rental}} housing sector may {{contribute}} to the reduction of global greenhouse gas emission. However, emissions have gone up since the early nineties despite of large <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> potentials. In general the effects of <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> regulations and <b>support</b> programmes were overestimated. Unfortunately, these programmes ignore market specific restraints. Markets do not provide optimal incentives to prevent emissions since the costs of greenhouse gas emissions are not fully internalised in fuel prices. Special characteristics of rental housing market in Germany enhance this deficit. Consequently profitable measures of <b>saving</b> <b>energy</b> are neglected. Overall the effectiveness of regulations and support programmes suffers. Therefore it is necessary to strengthen <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> incentives.

Since 2012, {{the introduction of the}} utility’s On-Bill Financing (OBF) option to the ESG program has allowed ESG to more effectively engage hard-to-reach customers with small margins to commit to more expensive projects with a longer payback period. Together, ESG and PG&E have successfully leveraged this financing option to increase the comprehensiveness of energy efficiency projects, resulting in deeper savings on a larger scale. This paper will focus on how ESG integrated OBF into a target market approach for grocery stores in order to increase the size and scope of individual projects, thereby overcoming financial barriers to drive more complex measure adoption. ESG has built a program on a high-touch market engagement model that targets the entire community of market partners (e. g. contractors, manufactures, distributors and industry associations) and utilizes available resources, such as financing, to deliver high volume and comprehensive <b>energy</b> <b>savings</b> that <b>support</b> market transformation...|$|R

A tool, known as e-Genie, was developed to engage workplace occupants with energy data and support them {{to take action to}} reduce energy use. Building on research insights within the field, e-Genie’s novel approach encourages users to make plans to meet <b>energy</b> <b>saving</b> goals, <b>supports</b> discussion, and considers social energy behaviours (e. g. discussing energy issues, taking part in campaigns) as well as individual actions. A field based study of e-Genie indicated that visualisations of energy data were engaging and that the discussion ‘Pinboard’ was particularly popular. Pre- and post survey (N = 77) evaluation of users indicated that people were significantly more concerned about energy issues and reported engaging more in social energy behaviour after ~two weeks of e-Genie being installed. Concurrently, objective measures of electricity use decreased over the same period, and continued decreasing over subsequent weeks.
