5000|$|LTSs {{simply the}} {{compliance}} requirements of fiduciary trustees and financial advisers as they usually include a standard set of documents (including {{the form of}} the global note), an information memorandum or prospectus, and a term sheet. The approval of the CSD is critical to this process; all instruments are verified before the issue of an ISIN number and the creation of the <b>dematerialised</b> <b>security</b> is handled by the CSD. The criteria for acceptance are quite strict. [...] IRS regulations stipulate particular requirements for tradable securities. These generally describe the characteristics necessary for an LTS (according to IRS definitions, at least).|$|E

50|$|Dematerialisation {{involves}} {{dispensing with}} paper instruments and certificates altogether. <b>Dematerialised</b> <b>securities</b> exist {{only in the}} form of electronic records. The legal impact of dematerialisation differs in relation to bearer and registered securities respectively.|$|R
50|$|Indeed, except rare exceptions, any {{chain of}} <b>dematerialised</b> <b>securities</b> {{contains}} {{at least four}} degrees: (1) the issuer, (2) the Central Securities Depository of the issuer ("CSD"), (3) the final intermediary and (4) the investor. In each subscription of a new security, {{each one of these}} actors forwards the security to the immediate lower level by a debit of its account and a credit of the account of its correspondent.|$|R
5000|$|Converting {{physical}} {{records of}} investments into electronic records is called [...] "dematerialising" [...] of securities.In order to <b>dematerialise</b> physical <b>securities,</b> investors must fill in a Demat Request Form (DRF), {{which is available}} with the DP and submit the same along with physical certificates. Every security has an ISIN (International Securities Identification Number). A separate DRF must be filled for every ISIN.|$|R
40|$|Despite the pre-eminence of the City of London as the worldâ€™s leading {{financial}} centre, around 10 {{million people}} in the UK continue to hold their shares in paper form, usually at home or occasionally with their bank or solicitor. The main intermediaries involved in this process, particularly the broker community and the registrars, have expressed their intention to move this process to a paperless, electronic approach. The key problem is an inefficient, archaic and paper-based process involving share certificates and transfer forms. Additionally the industry believes in providing the opportunity for all shareholders to be treated equally. It was thought that both issues could be addressed by the industry and a working group comprising members from the broker community, the registrars and industry associations and bodies was established to design a consensus based solution to <b>dematerialise</b> <b>securities</b> and enfranchise shareholders. This document puts forward the case for a reform and outlines the high-level principles, including the need for legislation, required to address the issues o...|$|R
5000|$|The {{ownership}} aspects concerning securities {{are governed}} in the United States by Article 8 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC). This Article 8, actually a text of about thirty pages, has undergone an important recasting in 1994. Since 1994, Article 8 of the UCC considers {{that the majority}} of the <b>dematerialised</b> <b>securities</b> that are registered on an account with intermediaries are only reflections of their respective initial issue registered by the two American central securities depositories, respectively the Depository Trust Company (DTC) for the securities issued by corporates and the Federal reserve for the securities issued by the Treasury Department. In this centralised system, the title transfer of the securities does not take place at the time of the registration on the account of the investor, but within the systems managed by the DTC and/or by the Federal reserve. This centralisation would not be shocking if it were also accompanied by a centralised register of the investors/owners of the securities, like what is done today in Sweden and in Finland(so-called [...] "transparent systems"). But the DTC and the FED hold no individual register of the transfers of property, so that the possibility for an investor of proving the property of its securities relies entirely on the good replication of the transfer recorded by the DTC and FED at the lower tiers of the holding chain of the securities.|$|R
