25|$|At {{the time}} C. S. Lewis wrote Miracles, quantum {{mechanics}} (and physical indeterminism) {{was only in}} the initial stages of acceptance, but still Lewis stated the logical possibility that, if the physical world was proved to be indeterministic, this would provide an entry (<b>interaction)</b> <b>point</b> into the traditionally viewed closed system, where a scientifically described physically probable/improbable event could be philosophically described as an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality. He states, however, that none of the arguments in his book will rely on this. It should also be noted that, while some interpretations of quantum mechanics consider wave function collapse to be indeterminate, in others this event is defined and deterministic.|$|E

40|$|During 1994 {{tests were}} made to {{evaluate}} the possibility of operating LEP with four equidistant bunch trains in each beam during 1995. A train will consist of up to four bunches with a bunch spacing of some 75 m. The bunch trains collide head-on. They are separated at the parasitic collision points {{on either side of}} the <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> by vertical electrostatic separator bumps. The accumulation of bunch trains in a single beam was studied with magnetically simulated bumps. Following the installation of additional separators late in 1994, the parasitic encounters of the bunch trains near the <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> were studied for one train of electron bunches colliding with one train of positron bunches in two diametrically opposite <b>interaction</b> <b>points.</b> The higherorder mode losses in the superconducting RF cavities were measured for several arrangements of beams, trains and bunches.

2500|$|The Pixel Detector, the {{innermost}} {{part of the}} detector, contains three concentric layers and three disks on each end-cap, {{with a total of}} 1,744 [...] modules, each measuring 2centimetres by 6centimetres. [...] The detecting material is 250µm thick silicon. [...] Each module contains 16 readout chips and other electronic components. The smallest unit that can be read out is a pixel (50 by 400micrometres); there are roughly 47,000pixels per module. [...] The minute pixel size is designed for extremely precise tracking very close to the <b>interaction</b> <b>point.</b> [...] In total, the Pixel Detector has over 80 million readout channels, which is about 50% of the total readout channels of the whole experiment. Having such a large count created a considerable design and engineering challenge. Another challenge was the radiation to which the Pixel Detector is exposed because of its proximity to the <b>interaction</b> <b>point,</b> requiring that all components be radiation hardened in order to continue operating after significant exposures.|$|E
2500|$|The ATLAS {{detector}} {{consists of}} a series of ever-larger concentric cylinders around the <b>interaction</b> <b>point</b> where the proton beams from the LHC collide. [...] It can be divided into four major parts: the Inner Detector, the calorimeters, the Muon Spectrometer and the magnet systems. [...] Each of these is in turn made of multiple layers. [...] The detectors are complementary: the Inner Detector tracks particles precisely, the calorimeters measure the energy of easily stopped particles, and the muon system makes additional measurements of highly penetrating muons. [...] The two magnet systems bend charged particles in the Inner Detector and the Muon Spectrometer, allowing their momenta to be measured.|$|E
2500|$|Particles {{that are}} {{produced}} in accelerators {{must also be}} observed, {{and this is the}} task of particle detectors. While interesting phenomena may occur when protons collide {{it is not enough to}} just produce them. Particle detectors must be built to detect particles, their masses, momentum, energies, lifetime, charges, and nuclear spins. In order to identify all particles produced at the <b>interaction</b> <b>point</b> where the particle beams collide, particle detectors are usually designed in layers like an onion. The layers are made up of detectors of different types, each of which is designed to observe specific types of particles. [...] The different traces that particles leave in each layer of the detector allow for effective particle identification and accurate measurements of energy and momentum. (The role of each layer in the detector is discussed below.) As the energy of the particles produced by the accelerator increases, the detectors attached to it must grow to effectively measure and stop higher-energy particles. ATLAS is the largest detector ever built at a particle collider.|$|E

40|$|The {{luminosity}} at {{the four}} <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> of the Large Hadron Collider must be continuously monitored {{in order to provide}} an adequate tool for the control and optimization of the collision parameters and the beam optics. At both sides of the <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> absorbers are installed to protect the super-conducting accelerator elements from quenches causes by the deposited energy of collision products. The luminosity detectors will be installed in the copper core of these absorbers to measure the electromagnetic and hadronic showers caused by neutral particles that are produced at the proton-proton collision in the <b>interaction</b> <b>points.</b> The detectors have to withstand extreme radiation levels (10 ^ 8 Gy/yr at the design luminosity) and their long-term operation has to be assured without requiring humain intervention. In addition the demand for bunch-by-bunch luminosity measurements, i. e. 40 MHz detection speed, puts severe constraints on the detectors. Polycrystalline CdTe detectors have a high potential to fulfill the requirements and are considered as LHC luminosity monitors. In this paper the interaction region is shown and the characteristics of the CdTe detectors are presented...|$|R

40|$|While well {{studied in}} the absence of beam–beam and while colliding head-on, the {{stability}} of the LHC beams can be very critical in intermediate steps. During the squeeze, the long-range beam–beam interaction becomes a critical component of the beam’s dynamics. Also, while the trans-verse separation at the <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> is collapsed, the beam–beam forces change drastically, possibly deteriorat-ing the beam’s stability. Finally, during luminosity produc-tion, the configuration of the LHC in 2012 included few bunches without head-on collision in any of the <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> having different stability properties.

40|$|Left {{and right}} {{of each of}} the four LEP <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> superconducting low-beta {{quadrupole}} magnets are installed to squeeze the vertical beam size at the <b>interaction</b> <b>points.</b> These magnets are the dominant source of vertical closed orbit drifts at LEP because of their strength, the large vertical beta function and their support. Hydrostatic Levelling Systems and resistor-based position sensors were installed to measure the vertical movements of these magnets continuously. The correlation between the mechanical movements and closed orbit variations has been studied. The analysis has shown that the orbit can be kept stable by acting on one correction dipole per low-beta quadrupole pair. This has led to a feed-back system which uses the mechanical measurements to correct the closed orbit and to prevent large orbit variations...|$|R

40|$|In {{software}} systems, different {{software applications}} often {{interact with each}} other through specific interfaces by exchanging data in string format. For example, web services {{interact with each other}} through XML strings. Database applications interact with a database through strings of SQL statements. Sometimes these interfaces between different software applications are complex and distributed. For example, a table in a database can be accessed by multiple methods in a database application and a single method can access multiple tables. In this paper, we propose an approach to understanding software application interfaces through string analysis. The approach first performs a static analysis of source code to identify <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> (in the form of interface-method-call sites). We then leverage existing string analysis tools to collect all possible string data that can be sent through these different <b>interaction</b> <b>points.</b> Then we manipulate collected string data by grouping similar data together. For example, we group together all collected SQL statements that access the same table. Then we associate various parts of aggregated data with <b>interaction</b> <b>points</b> in order to show the connections between entities from interacting applications. Our preliminary results show that the approach can help us understand the characteristics of interactions between database applications and databases. We also identify some challenges in this approach for our future work...|$|R
