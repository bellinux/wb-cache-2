5|$|The Victor B.1 was {{powered by}} an {{arrangement}} of four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines. The engines were embedded in pairs into the aircraft's wing root; {{because of the high}} mounted position of the wing, the tail had to adopt a high mounting to maintain clearance of the jet turbulence, however the airbrakes were ideally situated {{to take advantage of this}} phenomenon. Difficulties were encountered with the Sapphires when stationed in tropical environments; several engines were destroyed by the turbine blades striking the outer <b>engine</b> <b>casing.</b> The Victor B.2 adopted the newer Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan; the Conway at one point held the distinction of being the most powerful non-afterburning engine outside of the Soviet Union, and were significantly more powerful than the preceding Sapphire engines employed upon on the B.1.|$|E
25|$|First class {{passengers}} had {{quarters in}} the midship {{house on the}} bridge and shelter decks with access to a saloon lighted by a skylight and dinging room. Some rooms had private lavatories, but lavatories for men and another for women were located aft of the <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> on the shelter deck with another set {{in the center of}} the bridge deck accommodations. The upper deck was fitted for either light cargo or steerage passengers and, in the event of Chinese steerage passengers, had provision for a Chinese galley and wash area.|$|E
25|$|On 20 April 2010, an ADF MRH90 {{suffered}} a single engine failure near Adelaide, landing safely at RAAF Base Edinburgh. NHI Industries sent personnel to Australia {{to investigate the}} failure. On 18 May the ADF announced that the MRH90 fleet was grounded due to engine issues since the April incident. The cause of the failure was determined as the compressor blade contacting the <b>engine</b> <b>casing,</b> leading to new preventative inspections; flights resumed in July 2010. In June 2011, the NFH variant lost to the Sikorsky MH-60R in competition to replace the Royal Australian Navy S-70B Sea Hawks.|$|E

2500|$|Designed by Charles B. Franklin, the Scout was {{introduced}} in October 1919 as a 1920 model.

2500|$|After {{his second}} victory, Geschwaderkommodore Johann Schalk warned Zorner {{for leaving the}} Do217s idle. On Zorner's next flight, he {{operated}} the type. Zorner claimed his third victory on 19 February, north of Norderney at 20:34. The bomber was recorded as a Douglas A-20 Havoc. During the engagement Zorner's Dornier sustained a hit in the wing and one through the starboard <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> causing an oil leak, necessitating a forced landing on one engine. Although Zorner claimed a probable, an anti-aircraft artillery battery had witnessed the enemy bomber flying just above the sea before it disappeared into the mist. Since its recovery was deemed impossible, he was granted the victory. Zorner's victim was Vickers Wellington II, BJ919 OW-P of No. 426 Squadron RAF piloted by Sergeant J. O. R. Gauthier. [...] Sergeants H. R. Bailey, F. Ruzycki, R. C. Ramsay, Flight Sergeant R. W. Ferrier and Pilot Officer C. A. McKinnon, all of RCAF, were posted missing in action. The aircraft has never been found, and likely crashed into the North Sea. On the night of 26 February Zorner claimed a Short Stirling northwest of Schiermonnikoog at 20:46.|$|E
2500|$|Production {{aircraft}} were {{powered by}} various {{models of the}} Rolls-Royce Avon engine. This power-plant was initially rated as capable of generating [...] of dry thrust, but when employing the four-stage afterburner this increased to a maximum thrust of [...] Later models of the Avon would feature, in addition to increased thrust, a full-variable reheat arrangement. A special heat-reflecting paint containing gold was used to protect the aircraft's structure from the hot <b>engine</b> <b>casing</b> which could reach temperatures of 600°C. Under optimum conditions, a well-equipped maintenance facility would take four hours to perform an engine change so specialised ground test rigs were developed to speed up maintenance and remove the need to perform a full ground run of the engine after some maintenance tasks. The stacked engine configuration complicated maintenance work, and the leakage of fluid from the upper engine was a recurring fire hazard. The fire risk was reduced, but not eliminated, following remedial work during development. For removal the lower No.1 engine was removed from below the aircraft, after removal of the ventral tank and lower fuselage access panels, by lowering the engine down, while the upper No.2 engine was lifted out from above via removable sections in the fuselage top.|$|E

40|$|The {{finite element}} {{analysis}} of individual components of aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>casings</b> provides high accuracy and a good agreement with the measured response data. However, when these components are assembled, the accuracy of such predictions can significantly deteriorate since models describing stiffness and friction properties of joints are linearized. A full nonlinear analysis of the casing flanges is required to fully include {{the influence of the}} bolted joints, model the flexibility in the contact interface, and consider the nonlinear behavior of the contact due to partial slip and separation. In this paper different nonlinear models of casings are investigated with an available nonlinear analysis tool: A parametric study of the contact interface meshes is conducted to identify a satisfying analysis approach. The dynamic flange behavior is analyzed in detail, including effects of the bolt and normal load distribution. A comparison of the introduced nonlinear modeling with more traditional rigid or linear-elastic flange joint models is carried out to evaluate the effect of the nonlinear approach. The study demonstrates the nonlinear nature of a casing flange joint and highlights the need to include them in the analysis. The detailed modeling of the contact interaction of joints gives an insight in the nonlinear contact behavior of flanges of aircraft <b>engine</b> <b>casings,</b> and the predictive capabilities for the nonlinear analysis of gas turbine engine...|$|R
