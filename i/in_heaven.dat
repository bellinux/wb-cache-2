5|$|At {{the present}} {{there are many}} debates going on in Sri Lanka {{questioning}} {{the accuracy of the}} Buddhagosha's work. This is because of the changes in Vissuddhimagga from the original scripts. As indicated by the monastic S.Dhammika, Buddhagosha had not attained any state of Nibbana (sowan, sakrudhagami, anagami or arhath) but wished to be reborn <b>in</b> <b>heaven.</b> Therefore, it is not advisable to follow these texts rather than the pure original scripts of Dhamma which has been written by Arhaths.|$|E

An act of kindness {{does not seem to}} make him happier, but Bart takes Krusty to the synagogue, where Rabbi Krustofski's favorite Rabbi recites Krusty's jokes on religion. Krusty therefore deduces that his father did find him funny, and sees him again in Jewish Heaven, where Jesus turns Dangerfield's water into a Bloody Mary.|$|E

5|$|In Jainism, God has no {{role to play}} in an individual's destiny; one's {{personal}} destiny is {{not seen}} as a consequence of any system of reward or punishment, but rather {{as a result of its}} own personal karma. A text from a volume of the ancient Jain canon, Bhagvati sūtra 8.9.9, links specific states of existence to specific karmas. Violent deeds, killing of creatures having five sense organs, eating fish, and so on, lead to rebirth in hell. Deception, fraud and falsehood leads to rebirth in the animal and vegetable world. Kindness, compassion and humble character result in human birth; while austerities and the making and keeping of vows leads to rebirth <b>in</b> <b>heaven.</b>|$|E

He also cited a verse in the New Testament that said there would not be marriage <b>in</b> <b>heaven.</b> In addition, he required members to adopt similar clothing and haircuts, possibly to reinforce that they were a non-sexual family.|$|E
