After several iterations the approach taken was to extend the ISA S88 Part 1 State Model concept to the Packaging Industry. Later in the development process, the concept of PackTags was introduced to provide a uniform set of naming conventions for data elements used within the state model. PackTags are used for machine-to-machine communications; for example between a Filler and a Capper. In addition, PackTags were designed to address OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculations. PackTags can be used to provide data exchange between machines and higher level information systems like Manufacturing Operations Management and Enterprise Information Systems.|$|E

For this purpose, member companies agreed to support a common technical concept for production (i.e. discrete or factory automation) and process automation. First, the complex communication protocol Profibus FMS (<b>Field</b> <b>bus</b> Message Specification), which was tailored for demanding communication tasks, was specified. Subsequently in 1993, the specification for the simpler and thus considerably faster protocol PROFIBUS DP (Decentralised Peripherals) was completed. Profibus FMS is used for (non-deterministic) communication of data between Profibus Masters. Profibus DP is a protocol made for (deterministic) communication between Profibus masters and their remote I/O slaves.|$|E

50|$|The oldest {{commonly}} used <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> technology is Bitbus. Bitbus {{was created by}} Intel Corporation to enhance use of Multibus systems in industrial systems by separating slow i/o functions from faster memory access. In 1983, Intel created the 8044 Bitbus microcontroller by adding <b>field</b> <b>bus</b> firmware to its existing 8051 microcontroller. Bitbus uses EIA-485 at the physical layer, with two twisted pairs - one for data {{and the other for}} clocking and signals. Use of SDLC at the data link layer permits 250 nodes on one segment with a total distance of 13.2 km. Bitbus has one master node and multiple slaves, with slaves only responding to requests from the master. Bitbus does not define routing at the network layer. The 8044 permits only a relatively small data packet (13 bytes), but embeds an efficient set of RAC (remote access and control) tasks and the ability to develop custom RAC tasks. In 1990, the IEEE adopted Bitbus as the Microcontroller System Serial Control Bus (IEEE-1118).|$|E
40|$|CAN bus is a {{recommended}} fieldbus at CERN. It {{is widely}} used in the control systems of the experiments to control and monitor large amounts of equipment (IO devices, front-end electronics, power supplies). CAN nodes are distributed over busses that are interfaced to the computers via PCI or USB CAN interfaces. These interfaces limit the possible evolution of the Detector Control Systems (DCS). For instance, PCI cards are not compatible with all computer hardware and new requirements for virtualization and redundancy require dynamic reallocation of CAN bus interfaces to different computers. Additionally, these interfaces cannot be installed at a different location than the front-end computers. Ethernet based CAN interfaces resolve these issues, providing network access to the <b>field</b> <b>busses.</b> The Ethernet-CAN gateways from Analytica (GmbH) were evaluated {{to determine if they}} meet the hardware and software specifications of CERN.
