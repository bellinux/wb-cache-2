40|$|The {{research}} was conducted to characterize the fermentation of aquatic plants ensiled with and without additives and to determine the digestibility of dried and ensiled aquatic plants by lambs. Aquatic plants ensiled {{with the addition of}} organic acids, corn or haylage produced silages of undesirable quality. Additions of haylage to sterilized aquatic plants before ensiling resulted in a silage of more desirable quality. Dry matter and crude protein digestibilities for sheep fed diets that contained either Myriophyllum exalbescens or Potamogeton pectinatus were lower than for lambs fed dehydrated alfalfa. However, energy digestibility was highest for lambs fed Myriophyllum exalbescens. Mydiophyllum exalbescens appeared to be more palatable than Potamogeton pectinatus, but both were inferior to dehydrated alfalfa. Dry matter intakes of lambs fed ensiled aquatic plants, aquatic plants plus corn or aquatic plants plus haylage were lower than lambs fed either haylage or haylage plus corn diets. Additions of corn and haylage significantly increased aquatic plant organic matter digestibility. Energy and nitrogen digestibilities were lower for lambs fed diets that contained aquatic plants than for lambs fed haylage diets. The palatability of aquatic plants is a limiting factor in their use as a <b>forage.</b> <b>Drying</b> or ensiling {{do not appear to be}} satisfactory procedures for improving palatability.

Forages {{are low in}} fatty acids (FA) but these FA are rich in linolenic acid; it can thus be thought that forages are a valuable source of polyunsaturated FA for ruminants; however their ruminal {{metabolism and}} their digestibility are not well known. Aseries of 4 experiments was carried out on 4 forages (2 cocksfoots, red clover, perennial ryegrass) as fresh grass, silage and hay (or haylage) on cannulated sheep. <b>Forage</b> <b>drying</b> resulted in a decrease in FA content and {{in the proportion of}} linolenic acid. Hydrogenation was also reduced by drying, so that the amount of absorbable FA was only slightly modified. Ruminal metabolism produced a large variety of 18 -carbon trans monounsaturated isomers, of which transvaccenic acid was the main one, and very limited amounts of conjugated linoleic acids (CLA). This suggests the post-ruminal origin of meat and milk CLA, by desaturation of transvaccenic acid. Fatty acid digestibility was slightly higher for fresh grass and silage than for haylage and hay. An in vivo trial was carried out on cannulated steers receiving perennial ryegrass, white or red clover, and the mixtures of ryegrass and each of the clovers. Hydrogenation of linolenic acid was lower for red clover, alone or mixed with ryegrass. This effect of red clover could be due to its high content in polyphenol oxidase (PPO). This hypothesis has been studied in vitro, with a classical line rich in PPO, a line poor in PPO and the same line in which PPO was inactivated. Plant-induced lipolysis was reduced by high PPO content. These experiments improved the knowledge on FA digestion for forages. However, the specificities of red clover remain to be better known.

40|$|The goats {{raised in}} the barn are usually fed on fresh grass. As <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> can be stored for long periods in large amounts, <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding makes it {{possible}} to feed large numbers of goats in barns. This review explains the physiological factors involved in suppressing <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake and the cause of drinking following <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. Ruminants consume an enormous amount of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> in a short time. Eating rates of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> rapidly decreased in the first 40 min of feeding and subsequently declined gradually to low states in the remaining time of the feeding period. Saliva in large-type goats is secreted in large volume during the first hour after the commencement of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. It was elucidated that the marked suppression of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake during the first hour was caused by a feeding-induced hypovolemia and the loss of NaHCO 3 due to excessive salivation during the initial stages of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. On the other hand, it was indicated that the marked decrease in feed intake observed in the second hour of the 2 h feeding period was related to ruminal distension caused by the feed consumed and the copious amount of saliva secreted during <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. In addition, results indicate that the marked decreases in <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake after 40 min of feeding are caused by increases in plasma osmolality and subsequent thirst sensations produced by <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. After 40 min of the 2 h <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding period, the feed salt content is absorbed into the rumen and plasma osmolality increases. The combined effects of ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality accounted for 77. 6 % of the suppression of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake 40 min after the start of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding. The results indicate that ruminal distension and increased plasma osmolality are the main physiological factors in suppression of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> intake in large-type goats. There was very little drinking behavior observed during the first hour of the 2 h feeding period most water consumption occurring in the second hour. The cause of this thirst sensation during the second hour of <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> feeding period was not hypovolemia brought about by excessive salivation, but rather increases in plasma osmolality due to the ruminal absorption of salt from the consumed feed.

Thus, the study aimed to determine the variability and the linear and special correlations between the plant and soil attributes in order to select and indicate good representation of soil physical quality for forage productivity. In the growing season of 2006, on the Fazenda Bonança in Pereira Barreto (SP), the productivity of autumn corn forage (FDM) in an irrigated no-tillage system and the soil physical properties were analyzed. The purpose was to study the variability and the linear and spatial correlations between the plant and soil properties, to select an indicator of soil physical quality related to corn forage yield. A geostatistical grid was installed to collect soil and plant data, with 125 sampling points {{in an area of}} 2, 500 m².

In order to evaluate of morphphysiological characteristics and selection of superior accessions in tall fescue on 36 accessions a lattice square design with three replications was carried out in agricultural and natural resources research centre of Zanjan province. Result analysis of variance showed that different types of tall fescue had significant differences in wet and <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield, heading and flowering dates, panicle length, 1000 -grain weight and seed maturity. Accessions of 6000 - 71 (Borujen-Iran origin) and 1061 (Belgium origin) had the most wet matter. In contrast 6000 - 70 (Borujen-Iran origin) was the lowest value. Moreover, 078 (California origin) had the highest and 6000 - 71 (Borujen-Iran origin), VIII (Russia origin), Sabalan (Ardabil origin) had the lowest total dry matter. Phonotypical correlation coefficient showed significant positive correlation between flowering date with heading date, date of seed maturity (r= 0. 618 **), (r= 0. 456 *), respectively, and between wet and <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield (r= 0. 437 *). Wet forage yield (0. 437) and panicle length (0. 217) had the most direct and positive effects on <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield. In opposite, plant height had lower direct and positive effect (0. 051). Therefore, selection based on wet forage yield and panicle length is recommended for increasing <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield. Cluster analysis characterized accessions in three groups. At first group accessions located with high plant height but moderate wet and <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield. Accessions with least wet, <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield and panicle length settled in the second group. Third group had higher wet and <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield and moderate panicle length...|$|R

Two male cattle breeds consisted of indigenous cattle (Ongole Crossbred = OC) with average body weight of 78. 48 ± 7. 69 kg and Fries Holland Crossbred (FHC) with body weight of 83. 93 ± 17. 67 kg were kept in individual cages of 1 x 1. 2 m and they were given four kinds of Napier Grass subtituted with SRSC of 0, 25, 50 and 75 percent of <b>forage</b> <b>dry</b> matter. Therefore, factorial experiment of 2 x 4 was used in {{this research}}. The dry matter ratio of forage and concentrate was maintained at 50 : 50 % with total dry matter intake 3 % of body weight. Total Volatil Fatty Acid (VFA) production were influenced by the breed of cattle and the body weight, but there was no significant effect of breed on the N-NH 3. Both average of VFA (122. 92 ± 3. 22 mM/l) and N-NH 3 (4. 14 ± 0. 4 mM/l) were still in the optimum range for rumen micoorganisme activities. Regression analysis showed that the digestibility of crude fiber had same pattern with acetate (C 2), propionate (C 3), butirate (C 4), and valerate (C 5). It can be concluded that SRSC can be used to substite fresh Napier Grass up to 75 percent of <b>forage</b> <b>dry</b> matter in the diets of male cattle both OC and FHC...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the optimum plant density and nitrogen rate in maize (Zea mays L.) under the ecological conditions of the Southern Marmara Region. For this purpose, maize was grown at different plant densities and was fertilized with different rates of nitrogen during 2006 and 2007. The <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield, plant height, first ear height, stem diameter, leaf number plant- 1, ear number plant- 1, leaf ratio, stem ratio, ear ratio, ear diameter, leaf area index, and light interception were measured for all the treatments applied. The values of each parameter mentioned above were reorganized without regard to treatments or {{with regard to the}} highest and lowest values of plant density and nitrogen rates and were evaluated to determine the relationships between the <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield and yield-related components. For this purpose, the direct and indirect effects of the corresponding components on <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield were determined by using correlation and path analyses methods. The data averaged over two years, regardless of the treatment effects indicated that the relationship between the <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield and each yield component except for stem ratio was positively significant. Path analysis revealed that most of the yield components had direct effects on the <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield. According to this study, greater priority must be given to first ear height, leaf ratio and light interception to optimize silage maize yield. When the highest and the lowest plant densities and nitrogen rates were considered, it was understood that the nitrogen application had a greater effect on the <b>dry</b> <b>forage</b> yield than the plant density did...|$|R
40|$|The {{forage yield}} and quality traits and their {{heritability}} estimates over 2003 and 2004 in India were observed. Two hundred pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan) germplasm lines were planted at ICRISAT, Patancheru, Andhra Pradesh, India during kharif (rainy) season of 2003 and 2004, with 157 lines grown in both years. The lines were evaluated in a randomized block design with three replications, and harvested at 50 % flowering by cutting the plants about 2 feet aboveground. The tested pigeonpea lines showed large genetic variability for <b>forage</b> <b>dry</b> matter yield, nitrogen content, in vitro organic matter digestibility and condensed tannins content in 2003 and 2004. The five best lines for forage yield in rainy season 2003 (8. 8 - 10. 5 tonnes/ha) and 2004 (7. 0 to 7. 8 tonnes/ha) with forage nitrogen content, in vitro organic matter digestibility and condensed tannins content are presented. ICP 2098 {{was the most}} promising for forage yield with relatively superior quality in both years. <b>Forage</b> <b>dry</b> matter yield and forage quality traits were unrelated in the 2003 rainy season. However, in the 2004 rainy season, forage yield was positively associated with forage nitrogen content (r = 0. 32) and negatively with condensed tannins content (r=- 0. 18). Estimates of broad sense heritability (h 2) for forage yield, nitrogen, condensed tannins and in vitro digestibility were 0. 27, 0. 51, 0. 70 and 0. 34, respectively. Mean nitrogen content in the pigeonpea forage was 3. 4 and 3. 6 % in 2003 and 2004, respectively, suggesting that pigeonpea forage can serve as an effective supplement to nitrogen deficient feedstuffs...|$|R
