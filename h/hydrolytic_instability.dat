The degradation process is erosive and appears to take place in two steps during which the polymer is converted back to its monomer glycolic acid: first water diffuses into the amorphous (non-crystalline) regions of the polymer matrix, cleaving the ester bonds; the second step starts after the amorphous regions have been eroded, leaving the crystalline portion of the polymer susceptible to hydrolytic attack. Upon collapse of the crystalline regions the polymer chain dissolves.|$|E

40|$|Covalent organic {{frameworks}} (COFs) are {{an emerging}} class of crystalline two- or threedimensional polymers, discovered in 2005, {{with the ability}} to reliably incorporate functionality within high surface area scaffolds. Early COF literature primarily focused on structural elucidation of boron-based systems and typically alluded to a myriad of applications where the structural precision offered by COFs would be useful. However, these early systems suffered from <b>hydrolytic</b> and oxidative <b>instability</b> which precluded their use in applications. This dissertation describes a recent trend in COFs away from boron-based systems to more inherently robust nitrogen containing frameworks (Chapter 1). We illustrate this by discussing the development of the first redox-active COF which brought COFs into a new application space, namely electrochemical energy storage (Chapter 2). Initially, the performance of the COF was limited by its isolation as in insoluble powder and low electrical conductivity. However, we have addressed these issue through rational design first by targeting thin films (Chapter 3) and subsequently by examining the performance of a COF / conducting polymer hybrid (Chapter 4). We then applied the same electrochemical reasoning of COFs to a less ordered amorphous porous polymer where we expanded the energy density by controlling the cation of the electrolyte (Chapter 5). This work will serve as a roadmap for the design of future framework materials for electrochemical energy storage. i 2021 - 05 - 3...|$|R

30|$|The oleochemical esters are {{a growing}} {{interest}} {{with respect to}} the base lubricants industry. Their advantages compared to mineral base oil include low toxicity, higher biodegradability, renewability, high flash point, low volatility, high additive solvency power, high added value, good lubricity (due to molecule polarity), high viscosity index due to the double bonds and molecular linearity. However, the main disadvantages of these organic compounds are oxidative instability, <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>instability,</b> low temperature properties. These disadvantages can be minimized by additives, but the biodegradability, toxicity and the price can be endangered. Thus, the chemical synthesis of these compounds seems to be a veritable choice towards eco-friendly basestocks.

A basic objective of this study has been to gain a more complete understanding of the mechanisms and interactions of moisture in urethane systems to guide the development of reversion resistant materials for connector potting and conformal coating applications in high humidity environments.

The best interaction between titanocene structures and cyclodextrins was obtained in the case of β- and γ-cyclodextrin, having the hydrophobic moieties oriented to the secondary face of cyclodextrin. The hydrophobicity of titanocenes (log P) correlate with the titanocene-cyclodextrin interaction parameters, especially with the titanocene-cyclodextrin interaction energy; the compatible geometry and the interaction energy denote that the titanocene/β- and γ-cyclodextrin complex can be achieved. Valuable quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs) were also obtained in the titanocene class by using the same log P as the main parameter for the in vitro cytotoxic activity against HeLa, K 562, and Fem-x cell lines. Conclusions According to our theoretical study, the titanocene/cyclodextrin inclusion compounds can be obtained (high interaction energy; the encapsulation is energetically favourable). Further, the most hydrophobic compounds are better encapsulated in β- and γ-cyclodextrin molecules and are more stable (from energetically point of view) in comparison with α-cyclodextrin case. This study suggests that the titanocene / β- and γ-cyclodextrin complexes (or synthetically modified cyclodextrins with higher water solubility) could be experimentally synthesized and could have enhanced cytotoxic activity and even lower toxicity. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} of cis-platin {{in the treatment}} of cancer there has been a considerable exploration on the antitumoral activity of other transition metal complexes. One of the main problems about the application of transition metal complexes for chemotherapy is their potential toxicity. Recently the attention has been focused on titanium based complexes, which could have significant potential effect against solid tumor. The advantage of Ti (IV) complexes is their relative biological compatibility, which mostly leads to mild and revisable side effects. However, the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>instability</b> of known Ti(IV) complexes and formation of different species upon water addition makes their therapeutic application problematic, and raises a strong interest in the development of relatively stable Ti(IV) complexes with well defined hydrolytic behavior that demonstrate appreciable cytotoxic activity.

40|$|New {{types of}} organotrifluoroborate (RBF 3 -) salts are {{described}} in this thesis, primarily made and studied {{for the purpose of}} applying them as electrolytes in electrochemical devices. Electrolytes are an important potential application of ionic liquids (ILs) since their properties are extremely attractive in this role. Their main disadvantage in this application is their typically high viscosity, which limits mass transport rates in the electrolyte media. However, the overall performance of an electrolyte is not solely dependant on the viscosity of the IL. Taking dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSCs) as a currently investigated IL application, overall efficiencies appear to also be dependent on the type of IL. Therefore, the new RBF 3 - salts were synthesized with the aim of producing salts that could potentially exhibit low viscosity liquids or good conductive solids. The salts were also characterised for their electrolyte properties and those with good potential were further studied with the redox couple triiodide/iodide for use in DSSCs. Tribology studies were carried out for a phosphonium-based RBF 3 - that showed relatively good potential as a lubricant.

The structure contains the metal in a CoN 2 O 4 distorted octahedral coordination arrangement with curcumin binding {{to the metal}} in its enolic form. Binding to cobalt(III) increases the hydrolytic stability of curcumin. Complex 2, having a dicationic curcuminoid, shows significant cellular uptake and photoinduced cytotoxicity compared to its curcumin analogue 1. The dicationic cobalt(III) complex 2 has significantly better cellular uptake and bioactivity than the neutral species 1. Complex 2 with mitochondrial localization releases the mitocurcumin dye upon exposure to visible light (400 - 700 nm) in human breast cancer MCF- 7 cells through photoreduction of cobalt(III) to cobalt(II).

40|$|Caged {{compounds}} are a {{class of}} photosensitive reagents used to stimulate cells with spatial control down to a sub-cellular level, and millisecond temporal control. They comprise of biologically important molecule which is modified with a photolabile protecting group. In the absence of light, caged compounds are physiologically silent but irradiation with light induces the release of biologically active species. Illumination under two-photon conditions is particularly advantageous as it enables restriction of the photolysis volume to ~ 1 fL and it provides deeper penetration into scattering samples. This thesis reports {{the development of new}} protecting groups for two-photon uncaging in neuroscience. Mechanistically, the deprotection in these novel groups is designed to operate via an intramolecular photoinduced electron transfer (PeT) between the absorbing unit (electron-donor) and the release module (electron-acceptor). The modular design of these cages ensures separation of absorption and release steps, and allows each process to be tuned and optimized independently. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to the two-photon absorption phenomenon and a historic overview of the uncaging technique. It also discusses recent advances in the development of two-photon sensitive probes used in neuroscience. Chapter 2 describes the exploration of molecular designs for novel protecting groups. A two-photon absorbing dye (electron-donor; fluorene dye) and three different release units (electron-acceptors; nitrobenzyl, pyridinium and phenacyl) were identified as suitable building blocks for the current project. Efficiency of the intramolecular electron transfer between chosen units was evaluated using model dyads which constitute covalently linked electron-donor and acceptor species.

40|$|Fluorescent sensors {{provide a}} {{powerful}} analytical {{tool for the}} intracellular detection of metal cations. In some cases, these fluorescent metal-chelating sensors have helped elucidate the function of metal cations within complicated cellular systems. However, most measure or sense changes in the bulk concentration of a metal species and {{do not respond to}} those involved in a specific cellular event. For instance, misregulated copper and iron are implicated in neurodegenerative disease and cancer because of their ability to catalytically propagate the formation of the hydroxyl radical through reaction with hydrogen peroxide. A fluorescent sensor that is unresponsive to metal binding until activation by intracellular hydrogen peroxide could potentially pinpoint the location of this oxidative reaction and provide an understanding of the relationship between copper/iron and hydrogen peroxide. 	Described here is the development of two fluorescent prochelators that show a selective fluorescence response to iron or copper only in the presence of hydrogen peroxide. A boronic ester masked spirolactam-based prochelator displays a copper-selective turn-on response after oxidation with hydrogen peroxide in organic solvents as determined by absorbance and fluorescence spectroscopy. However, a competing mechanism occurs in aqueous solution due to <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>instability</b> of the masked prochelator and results in a separate copper-dependent turn-on response as verified by liquid chromatography-mass spectroscopy. A second fluorescent prochelator design relies on metal-dependent fluorescence quenching after oxidation of a self-immolative boronic ester in both organic and aqueous solvents. Cellular microscopy studies show that the sensor's fluorescence intensity is unchanged until incubation with exogenous hydrogen peroxide, which resulted in a decreased fluorescent signal that is restored upon competitive chelation. Both of these prochelators provide a template for future applications and designs with improved properties. 	Two additional chapters describe the development of a UV-activated iron prochelator and a new fluorescently tagged metal chelator. The UV-activated prochelator is protected with two nitrophenyl groups that are photolyzed with 350 nm light within 10 minutes to reveal a high affinity iron triazole-base chelator. A chelator of this nature may provide protection from UV-induced iron liberation and oxidative stress. A second triazole-based chelator with an embedded coumarin fluorophore was prepared as a potential metal sensor. However, this design showed off-target fluorescence responses, thus it cannot be utilized in its current form for metal detection. Dissertatio...|$|E
40|$|CONSPECTUS: Curcumin is a polyphenolic species. As {{an active}} {{ingredient}} of turmeric, it is well-known for its traditional medicinal properties. The therapeutic values include antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antiseptic, and anticancer activity {{with the last}} being primarily due to inhibition of the transcription factor NF-kappa B besides affecting several biological pathways to arrest tumor growth and its progression. Curcumin with all these positive qualities has only remained a potential candidate for cancer treatment over the years without seeing any proper usage because of its <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>instability</b> involving the diketo moiety in a cellular medium and its poor bioavailability. The situation has changed considerably in recent years with the observation that curcumin in monoanionic form could be stabilized on binding to a metal ion. The reports from our group and other groups have shown that curcumin in the metal-bound form retains its therapeutic potential. This has opened up new avenues to develop curcumin-based metal complexes as anticancer agents. Zinc(II) complexes of curcumin are shown to be stable in a cellular medium. They display moderate cytotoxicity against prostate cancer and neuroblastoma cell lines. A similar stabilization and cytotoxic effect is reported for (arene) ruthenium(II) complexes of curcumin against a variety of cell lines. The half-sandwich 1, 3, 5 -triaza- 7 -phosphatricyclo- 3. 3. 1. 1]decane (RAPTA) -type ruthenium(II) complexes of curcumin are shown to be promising cytotoxic agents with low micromolar concentrations {{for a series of}} cancer cell lines. In a different approach, cobalt(III) complexes of curcumin are used for its cellular delivery in hypoxic tumor cells using intracellular agents that reduce the metal and release curcumin as a cytotoxin. Utilizing the photophysical and photochemical properties of the curcumin dye, we have designed and synthesized photoactive curcumin metal complexes that are used for cellular imaging by fluorescence microscopy and damaging the cancer cells on photoactivation in visible light while being minimally toxic in darkness. In this Account, we have made an attempt to review the current status of the chemistry of metal curcumin complexes and present results from our recent studies on curcumin complexes showing remarkable in vitro photocytotoxicity. The undesirable dark toxicity of the complexes can be reduced with suitable choice of the metal and the ancillary ligands in a ternary structure. The complexes can be directed to specific subcellular organelles. Selectivity by targeting cancer cells over normal cells can be achieved with suitable ligand design.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{chemically}} modify biomolecules has facilitated {{our ability to}} detect, manipulate, and study them both in vitro and in vivo, {{as well as to}} prepare and tailor the properties of biologics and other pharmaceuticals based on natural products. This thesis describes several projects united around the theme of new methods to chemically modify biomolecules. The bulk of the thesis describes a new method to prepare protein bioconjugates relevant to diagnosis and treatment of human disease, while the last chapter describes {{the development of a new}} research tool to image protein glycosylation in vivo. 	Chapter 1 describes the state of the art in protein modification methods by examining them through the lens of site-specific antibody–drug conjugates. Many methods for site-specific protein modification are now known in the literature, but only the subset that have met stringent requirements with respect to reagent and conjugate stability, minimal side reactivity, fast reaction kinetics, and amenability to structure-activity relationship studies have been seriously considered for use on a commercial scale. Thus, rather than cataloging every known method for site-specific protein modification, this chapter harnesses the collective wisdom of the field in detailing the origins and practical uses of the most popular and well-validated methods for site-specific protein modification. 	Chapters 2 and 3 describe my contributions to the field resulting in a reaction for protein modification known as the Pictet–Spengler ligation. Aldehyde- and ketone-functionalized proteins are appealing substrates for the development of chemically modified biotherapeutics and protein-based materials. Their reactive carbonyl groups are typically conjugated with α-effect nucleophiles, such as substituted hydrazines and alkoxyamines, to generate hydrazones and oximes, respectively. However, the resulting C=N linkages are susceptible to hydrolysis under physiologically relevant conditions, which limits the utility of such conjugates in biological systems. The Pictet–Spengler ligation addresses this problem by providing a means to generate a stable linkage to protein aldehydes and ketones. 	Aside from their <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>instability,</b> another drawback of oxime linkages is that the optimal conditions for their formation are acidic (pH 4. 5), preventing their use with acid-sensitive proteins and post-translational modifications. The work in Chapter 3 describes a variant of the Pictet–Spengler ligation, the hydrazino-Pictet–Spengler ligation, that proceeds quickly near neutral pH. This work was carried out at Redwood Bioscience (now part of Catalent Pharma Solutions), a biotechnology company based in Emeryville, CA that uses aldehyde-functionalized proteins to prepare site-specifically modified antibody-drug conjugates. 	Chapter 4 transitions from protein modification to glycan modification, describing a new method that combines the Bertozzi lab’s longstanding interest in metabolic glycoengineering with recent advances in fluorogenic bioorthogonal reactions to image internal cell-surface glycans in live zebrafish. Vertebrate glycans constitute a large, important, and dynamic set of post-translational modifications that are notoriously difficult to manipulate and image. We have previously used the chemical reporter strategy in conjunction with bioorthogonal chemistry to image glycans on the enveloping layer of live zebrafish embryos; however, the ability to image glycans systemically inside a live organism has remained elusive. This chapter describes a method that combines metabolic incorporation of a cyclooctyne-functionalized sialic acid derivative with a fluorogenic tetrazine ligation reaction, allowing us to image sialylated glycoconjugates within in live zebrafish embryos...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Titanium- 45, a {{candidate}} PET isotope, is under-employed {{largely because of}} the challenging aqueous chemistry of Ti(IV). The propensity for hydrolysis of Ti(IV) compounds makes radio-labeling difficult and excludes 45 Ti from use in bio-conjugate chemistry. This is unfortunate because the physical characteristics are extremely desirable: 45 Ti has a 3 hour half-life, a positron branching ratio of 85 %, a low Eβmax of 1. 04 MeV, and negligible secondary gamma emission. In terms of isotope production, 45 Ti is transmuted from naturally mono-isotopic 45 Sc by low energy proton irradiation. The high cross-section and production rates on an unenriched metal foil target contribute to make 45 Ti an ideal PET radionuclide. In order to bring 45 Ti to even a preclinical plat-form, the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>instability</b> of aqueous Ti(IV) needs to be addressed. Recently, the groups of Edit Tshuva (Hebrew University of Jerusalem) and Thomas Huhn (University of Konstanz) have synthesized several stable Ti(IV) compounds based upon the salan ligand [1, 2]. Additionally, these compounds have shown heightened cyto-toxicity against HT- 29 (human colorectal cancer) cells, amongst others, as compared to traditional metal-based chemotherapeutics such as cisplatin. The aim of our work has been to produce the radioactive analogue of one of these Ti(IV) -salan compounds, Ti-salan-dipic [2], which has hydro-lytic stability on the order of weeks. Not only will this allow us to shed some light on the still un-known mechanism of antiproliferative action of titanium-based chemotherapeutics, but it will also make progress toward bioconjugate 45 Ti PET tracers. In the current abstract, we present some of the methods we are using to separate 45 Ti from irradiated Sc, and subsequent labeling conditions. Material and Methods 45 Ti was produced by proton irradiation of 250 μm scandium foils at currents ranging from 10 - 20 μA on a GE PETTrace. In order to increase production rate in the thin foil, an 800 μm aluminum degrader was used to take the proton energy down from the nominal 16 MeV. The scandium was cooled by contact to a water-cooled silver plate. The activated foil was dissolved in 4 M HCl, dried under argon at 120 oC, and taken back up in 12 M HCl. Here, four (i-iv below) different approaches to removing the Ti from the Sc and labeling were taken with varying success. Briefly: i. 45 Ti was separated on hydroxamate resin, as presented by K. Gagnon [3], only at 12 M acid concentration followed by on-column radiolabeling. ii. 45 Ti was extracted into 1 -octanol [4], stripped with 12 M HCl, and used directly for labeling from the organic phase. iii. 45 Ti was trapped on a C- 18 cartridge that had been pre-loaded with 1 -octanol, similar to ion-pairing, and eluted with isopropanol. iv. 45 Ti was extracted onto a polystyrene based 1, 3 diol resin (RAPP polymers) and labeling commenced on the column. Radiolabeling was slightly different in each condition, but in general the salan and dipic ligands were added to the 45 Ti in pyridine and reacted at elevated temperature (60 – 100 oC) for several (10 – 30) minutes. Reaction progression and radiochemical purity were assessed with silica TLC in chloroform : ethyl acetate (1 : 1). Results and Conclusion The trap, release, and yields for the four methods listed above are shown in TABLE 1. The best result was with the 1, 3 diol resin which had the added advantage of reacting on-column. Further optimization is underway including a test of a solid supported 1, 2 diol, and preclinical imaging with HT- 29 xenografts. We conclude that hydrolytically stable 45 Ti com-pounds can be synthesized in high yield, and hope that this advances the radiochemistry and use of 45 Ti toward more widespread applications...|$|E
