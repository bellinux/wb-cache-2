40|$|Who are you? And <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> say in {{choosing}} who you are? Identity {{is a complicated}} issue, it is both individualistic and necessarily relies on your environment and peers. I believe that as it stands, your identity may {{be a result of}} both solitary and societal thinking. However, I think that society and government act as the sole authenticators of an individual’s identity. I do not believe this is how an individual’s life ought to be treated. Thus, I am arguing in this thesis that the individual has the capacity to choose their own identity, and that society and government ought to authenticate the decisions made by individuals. In order to prove my claim I will first specify the types of identity I will be discussing in this thesis. I will then explore the theories of three philosophers: Anthony Appiah, Ian Hacking, and Charles Taylor. In chapters 2 2 ̆ 6 3, I will first analyze Anthony Appiah, who in arguing against the existence of race posits several ideas about identity including a theory of identity. Second, in chapter 4, I will analyze Ian Hacking, who presents a theory of identity creation, named labeling theory, and then presents a counter-theory of identity creation. Third, in chapter 5, I will analyze Charles Taylor’s claims about the effect recognition has on identity formation. Continuing to analyze Taylor in chapter 5, I will also analyze the importance of championing the politics of difference both to the individual and towards my claim. I will then provide examples of how my claim may be actualized in chapter 6, alongside counterarguments to my claims. Last, I will conclude my thesis in chapter 7...|$|E

30|$|The US National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) is {{a longstanding}} grading system widely used for {{evaluating}} {{an array of}} adverse events in cancer treatment. There is a growing awareness {{of the importance of}} patients’ self-reporting of symptoms using patient-reported outcome (PRO) tools in addition to professional assessments [1 – 3]. In order to improve the accuracy and efficiency of collecting and grading adverse event data, the NCI has established the Patient-Reported Outcomes version of the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (PRO-CTCAE) measurement system [4 – 7]. The PRO-CTCAE item library contains 124 items reflecting 78 symptomatic adverse events drawn from the CTCAE version 4.0. The PRO-CTCAE was developed to be used in conjunction with the CTCAE [7]. PRO-CTCAE symptom attributes include frequency (F) (e.g., “In the last 7 days, how often did you have nausea?”), severity (S) (e.g., “In the last 7 days, what was the severity of your pain?”), interference with daily activities (I) (e.g., “How much did fatigue interfere with your usual or daily activities?”), and presence/absence/amount (P) (e.g., “In the last 7 days, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> bed sores?”). PRO-CTCAE scores range from 0 to 4, corresponding to the response choices. The recall period for each question is the previous 7 days [8]. Content validation and a psychometric evaluation of the PRO-CTCAE measurement system have already been performed [6, 9] and their feasibility investigated in a multicenter oncology trial [10]. In addition, cognitive interview-based validation was performed in an adolescents-with-cancer population [11] and a pediatric and prosy version of the PRO-CTCAE is also being developed [12]. As part of the development of PRO-CTCAE, the NCI has collaborated on the development of versions of PRO-CTCAE in multiple other languages, such as Spanish [13], German [14], and Danish [15] language versions. A Japanese-language version was also created, in a joint endeavor by Tohoku University, The University of Tokyo, and the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG). The purpose of the Japanese translation is to encourage the use of PRO-CTCAE among Japanese-speaking cancer patients living in the USA, as well as those in Japan [16].|$|E
40|$|A Clinical Paper Submitted in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Nursing - Family Nurse Practitioner [...] University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, 2008 Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death in women and the primary cause of women's {{disability}} in the U. S. today. Acute coronary syndrome is inadequate blood flow through the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle. This can result in damage to the heart muscle or death. In the past, studies generally excluded the female population. Recent studies have shown that there are some significant differences between men and women regarding clinical presentation, signs and symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of coronary artery disease (CAD). The purpose of this qualitative, phenomenological study was to describe the lived experiences of women prior to the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This study provided information to better understand the prodromal and acute symptoms that women have prior to ACS. The theoretical framework for this study was based on Newman's 1999 nursing theory of Health as Expanding Consciousness. Nurse practitioners from a northeastern Wisconsin clinic helped to identify SUbjects who fit the criteria and who were willing to participate in the study. Data were collected through unstructured interviews that asked adult female participants to respond to the follOWing open-ended questions: 1. Tell me about your experience when you had your heart attack. 2. How was your life before you had your heart attack? 3. <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> new or unusual symptoms prior to your heart attack that you believe were associated with your heart attack? 4. What symptoms did you experience during your heart attack and how severe were these symptoms? 5. Has your life changed since this experience? The participants were interviewed either in their home or in the clinic office. The participants decided on the location. The researcher explained the study and obtained written consent prior to the interview process. The interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. The researcher also developed a demographic questionnaire that was given to each participant to complete immediately prior to the interview. The interviews lasted approximately 1 hour...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Medically treated {{injuries}} {{have been}} shown to increase with increasing body mass index (BMI). Information is lacking on the frequency and type of injuries and illnesses among overweight and obese adults who engage in regular physical activities as part of weight loss or weight gain prevention programs. Methods Sedentary adults with BMIs between 25 and 40 kg/m 2 (n = 397) enrolled in one of two randomized clinical trials that emphasized exercise as part of a weight loss or weight gain prevention program. Interventions differed by duration of the exercise goal (150, 200, or 300 minutes/week or control group). Walking was prescribed as the primary mode of exercise. At six month intervals, participants were asked, "During the past six months, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>any</b> injury or illness that affected your ability to exercise?" Longitudinal models were used to assess the effects of exercise and BMI on the pattern of injuries/illnesses attributed to exercise over time; censored linear regression was used to identify predictors of time to first injury/illness attributed to exercise. Results During the 18 -month study, 46 % reported at least one injury/illness, and 32 % reported at least one injury that was attributed to exercise. Lower-body musculoskeletal injuries (21 %) were the most commonly reported injury followed by cold/flu/respiratory infections (18 %) and back pain/injury (10 %). Knee injuries comprised one-third of the lower-body musculoskeletal injuries. Only 7 % of the injuries were attributed to exercise alone, and 59 % of the injuries did not involve exercise. BMI (p ≤ 0. 01) but not exercise (p ≥ 0. 41) was significantly associated with time to first injury and injuries over time. Participants with higher BMIs were injured earlier or had increased odds of injury over time than participants with lower BMIs. Due to the linear dose-response relationship between BMI and injury/illness, any weight loss and reduction in BMI was associated with a decrease risk of injury/illness and delay in time to injury/illness. Conclusions Overweight and obese adults who were prescribed exercise as part of weight loss or weight gain prevention intervention were not at increased risk of injury compared to overweight adults randomized not to participate in prescribed exercise. Since onset of injury/illness and pattern of injuries over time in overweight and obese individuals were attributed to BMI, weight reduction may be an avenue {{to reduce the risk of}} injury/illness in sedentary and previously sedentary overweight and obese adults.
