This {{was done by}} condensing urea (an animal waste product) with <b>diethyl</b> <b>malonate</b> (an ester derived from the acid of apples). There are several stories about how the substance got its name. The most likely story is that Baeyer and his colleagues went to celebrate their discovery in a tavern where the town's artillery garrison were also celebrating the feast of Saint Barbara– {{the patron saint of}} artillerymen. An artillery officer is said to have christened the new substance by amalgamating Barbara with urea. [...] Another story holds that Baeyer synthesized the substance from the collected urine of a Munich waitress named Barbara. No substance of medical value was discovered, however, until 1903 when two German scientists working at Bayer, Emil Fischer and Joseph von Mering, discovered that barbital was very effective in putting dogs to sleep. Barbital was then marketed by Bayer under the trade name Veronal. It is said that Mering proposed this name because the most peaceful place he knew was the Italian city of Verona.|$|E

Dynamic mechanical analysis and differential scanning calorimetry were used to investigate the viscoelastic mechanical and thermal film properties of the blends. All the investigated plasticizers reduced the glass-transition temperature of PLA, and the plasticization effect was better for the plasticizers of low molar mass. However, the amorphous domains of PLA became saturated with plasticizer at a certain concentration, and phase separation occurred. A higher molar mass of the plasticizer caused this saturation to occur at lower plasticizer concentrations. Subsequently, the aging of the blends at the ambient temperature for 4 months induced phase separation in the blends containing DBM, whereas those with an oligomeric plasticizer were stable and remained compatible with PLA within the aging period.

40|$|Poly(lactic acid), PLA, was {{blended with}} monomeric and {{oligomeric}} plasticizers {{in order to}} enhance its flexibility and thereby overcome its inherent problem of brittleness. Differential scanning calorimetry, dynamic mechanical analysis, transmission electron microscopy, and tensile testing were used to investigate the properties of the blends. Monomeric plasticizers, such as tributyl citrate, TbC, and <b>diethyl</b> bishydroxymethyl <b>malonate,</b> DBM, drastically decreased the T-g of PLA, but the blends showed no morphological stability over time since rapid cold crystallization caused a size reduction of the amorphous domains in PLA. Consequently, the ability of PLA to accommodate the plasticizer diminished with the increase in crystallinity and migration of the plasticizer occurred. Increasing the molecular weight of the plasticizers by synthesizing oligoesters and oligoesteram ides resulted in blends that displayed T-g depressions slightly smaller than with the monomeric plasticizers. The compatibility with PLA was dependent on the molecular weight of the oligomers and on the presence or not of polar amide groups that were able to positively interact with the PLA chains. Aging the materials at ambient temperature revealed that the enhanced flexibility as well as the morphological stability of the films plasticized with the oligomers could be maintained {{as a result of the}} higher molecular weight and the polar interactions with PLA...|$|R
