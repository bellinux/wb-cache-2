40|$|The LCLS x-ray FEL has {{recently}} achieved its 1. 5 -Angstrom lasing and saturation goals upon first trial. This was achieved {{as a result}} of a thorough pre-beam checkout, both traditional and beam-based component alignment techniques, and high electron beam brightness. The x-ray FEL process demands very tight tolerances on the straightness of the electron beam trajectory (< 5 {micro}m) through the LCLS undulator system. Tight, but less stringent tolerances of {approx} 100 {micro}m rms were met for the transverse placement of the individual undulator segments with respect to the beam axis.

Most of the alignment requirements are well {{within the range of}} proven traditional alignment techniques. Alignment of the undulator section is the most demanding. State-of-the-art equipment and procedures will be needed to meet the positioning requirements. The alignment coordinate system will be the existing Cartesian right-handed system, which was implemented for the SLC project and was also used for the PEPII project. The alignment network will consist of four parts: a small surface network to better integrate the remote hall into the global coordinate system, and three tunnel networks for linac, undulator and transport lines / experimental areas alignment. The network geometry is driven by the tunnel and machine layout and should permit observation of each target point from at least three stations. The design philosophy is based on a 3 -D monument design providing the best possible positional accuracy. For the undulator hall network, a triplet of monuments is placed in the tunnel cross-section at each quadrupole location. The other networks are constructed similarly but with fewer monuments.

40|$|A {{model of}} a ductile fault zone is {{incorporated}} into a forward 3 -D earthquake model to better constrain fault-zone hydraulics. The conceptual framework of the model fault zone was chosen such that two distinct parts are recognized. The fault core, characterized by a relatively low permeability, is composed of a coseismic fault surface embedded in a visco-elastic volume that can creep and compact. The fault core is surrounded by, and mostly sealed from, a high permeability damaged zone. The model fault properties correspond explicitly {{to those of the}} coseismic fault core. Porosity and pore pressure evolve to account for the viscous compaction of the fault core, while stresses evolve in response to the applied tectonic loading and to shear creep of the fault itself. A small diffusive leakage is allowed {{in and out of the}} fault zone. Coseismically, porosity is created to account for frictional dilatancy. We show in the case of a 3 -D fault model with no in-plane flow and constant fluid compressibility, pore pressures do not drop to <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>levels</b> after a seismic rupture, leading to an overpressured weak fault. Since pore pressure plays a key role in the fault behaviour, we investigate coseismic hydraulic property changes. In the full 3 -D model, pore pressures vary instantaneously by the poroelastic effect during the propagation of the rupture. Once the stress state stabilizes, pore pressures are incrementally redistributed in the failed patch. We show that the significant effect of pressure-dependent fluid compressibility in the no in-plane flow case becomes a secondary effect when the other spatial dimensions are considered because in-plane flow with a near-lithostatically pressured neighbourhood equilibrates at a pressure much higher than <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>levels,</b> forming persistent high-pressure fluid compartments. If the observed faults are not all overpressured and weak, other mechanisms, not included in this model, must be at work in nature, which need to be investigated. Significant leakage perpendicular to the fault strike (in the case of a young fault), or cracks hydraulically linking the fault core to the damaged zone (for a mature fault) are probable mechanisms for keeping the faults strong and might play a significant role in modulating fault pore pressures. Therefore, fault-normal hydraulic properties of fault zones should be a future focus of field and numerical experiment...|$|R
