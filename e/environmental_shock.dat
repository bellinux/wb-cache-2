40|$|Natural {{disasters}} or <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks</b> {{have the}} potential to disrupt local agricultural systems as well as distant agricultural systems through cascading effects. In this work we selected two distinct <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks</b> and traced their cascading effects on land use change. Quantifying cascading effects is a salient issue because climate change forecasts indicate an increase in frequency and intensity of global <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks.</b> This study incorporated the concept of telecoupled systems involving interrelating ecological, economic and political/social components. A telecoupled framework involving cascading effects was implemented using three approaches. The first approach involved using bilateral agricultural trade matrix data to analyze time-based production/consumption changes of agricultural systems directly and by using Input-Output. Next, we employed time-based network analysis to identify regions vulnerable to <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks</b> through globalization of agricultural trade. Land use changes associated with <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks</b> that occurred in telecoupled regions were delineated using image processing software to quantify the impacts of affected regions. Based on two selected <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks,</b> empirically-based case studies were developed that provided insight on cascading effects. Case study 1 linked a drought in the US to economic/trade changes that influenced land use changes in Paraguay releasing 128, 950. 4 Mg of stored Carbon. Case study 2 linked a typhoon in Malaysia to economic/trade changes that influenced land use changes in Colombia releasing 544, 212 Mg of stored Carbon. These findings provide implications for future impact assessments of <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks.</b> The ongoing research should focus on quantifying and refining of global land use change impacts attributed to <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks...</b>|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse South African pension fund {{conversions}} from defined benefit to defined contribution structures and to develop a model for dealing with environmental change. Design/Methodology/Approach: Qualitative research methodology was used. Industry experts were interviewed to obtain a macro view of the phenomenon and specific manifestations of the phenomenon were also considered in case studies. Feedback from semi-structured interviews was categorised into several emergent themes. Within-case and cross-case analyses were conducted. Findings: Results indicated that an <b>environmental</b> <b>shock</b> exerted a substantial influence on the course of events. Under these: Various factors combined to drive organisational evolution (i. e. adaptation to the environment). Adaptation speed was inappropriate and exceeded that which was required for sufficient thought. Uncertainty and vacuum circumstances arose leading to consequences that require redress. The relative power of the stakeholders changed and influenced the strategic outcome. An imbalance in stakeholder interests arose and ethical factors became consequential. Business acted to restore certainty for itself. Implications: This paper provides insight into organisational behaviour during periods of <b>environmental</b> <b>shock.</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>shock</b> can be defined as "a condition that arises where business or societal rules are inadequate, or do not exist, to deal with unfolding events". An <b>environmental</b> <b>shock</b> has greater magnitude than a competitive shock, and can include several competitive shocks. Originality/Value: Analysis of pension fund conversions revealed organisational behaviour during periods of <b>environmental</b> <b>shock</b> and the emerging model can be applied in other instances of <b>environmental</b> <b>shock,</b> such as broad-based black economic empowerment (B-B BEE), land redistribution, sanctions and constitutional development. </p...|$|E

In this study, a simulation methodology is used to examine how different sequences in changes to strategy, structure, and resource allocation affect the success of the adaptation process. Results show that the choice of change sequence leads to varying outcomes in organizational maneuverability, competence, and effectiveness. However, no one sequence is optimal for all scenarios; the best sequence choice depends on the goals of the change process as well as the content and direction of change.

In this context, with tremendous societal implications, this research draws on institutional theory and the strategic management literature to consider whether <b>environmental</b> <b>shock</b> alters the relationship between strategic conformity and firm performance. In doing so, this research also examines the contingency of board capital, arguing that <b>environmental</b> <b>shock</b> creates {{an opportunity for the}} board of directors to exert greater influence on the firm?s strategy-setting and ultimately its performance. These predictions are tested using a sample of 348 banks who were required to report financial information to the Federal Reserve from 2005 to 2013, augmented by information on over 7, 000 of these banks? directors. While the results do not support the assertion that strategic deviation becomes more valuable during crisis, I do find evidence that board composition affects the strategic conformity of the firm. Further, the industry experience of board members is associated with higher firm performance over a multi-year period following a shock. The results also indicate that other related expertise obtained outside of the industry can also prove useful to the firm during periods of <b>environmental</b> <b>shock.</b> In addition to contributing a greater understanding of when and how board capital can affect firm outcomes, this research also provides a deeper understanding {{of one of the most}} disruptive economic events of the modern era...|$|E

In an effort to answer these questions, this paper analyses the asset dynamics of Ethiopian and Honduran households in the wake of severe <b>environmental</b> <b>shocks.</b> While the patterns are different across countries, both reveal worlds in which the poorest households struggle most with shocks, adopting coping strategies which are costly in terms of both short term and long term well-being.
