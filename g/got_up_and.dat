5|$|After that, Finlay faced Rey Mysterio. Both men {{performed}} many offensive maneuvers {{through the}} match, but Mysterio gained the advantage when he kicked Finlay as he {{hung from the}} ropes, followed by a Leg drop, sending Finlay to ringside area and striking his head. In result of an injury, Finlay was stretchered out of the ring, and Mysterio followed. Finlay, however, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> attacked Mysterio, ending the match in a no contest.|$|E
60|$|My mother <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{suddenly}} <b>and</b> {{went and}} kissed Lettie fervently.|$|R

60|$|Allie <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> shyly <b>and</b> with {{difficulty}} disengaged {{her hand from}} Neale's.|$|R
5|$|Joe Shea <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> started calmly with {{a report}} {{on the state of the}} investigation. But within a minute, he was rambling, and in another thirty seconds, he was incoherent. I looked at him and saw my father, in the grip of {{dementia}} praecox. It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{injuries}} {{also made}} him permanently unable {{to sit for}} long periods without pain, so when he attended conferences as a politician, he would briefly rise from his seat from time to time. During his talks with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson aboard HMS Tiger in 1966, Smith regularly <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> looked out of a porthole; the British incorrectly interpreted this as Smith feeling intimidated by Wilson, or seasick.|$|E
5|$|During the quarter-finals, Canada {{faced the}} United States with McLeod {{starting}} in goal. In the twelfth {{minute of the}} game, American player Heather O'Reilly made a shot on goal, but it was stopped by McLeod. Angela Hucles then got the rebound and scored for the United States. However, McLeod injured her right knee during the play. She was down for several minutes before she <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> attempted to resume playing. A few minutes later, she was replaced by goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc in the 19th minute. The United States won the game 1–2. It was later revealed that McLeod had torn her right ACL.|$|E
60|$|The fellow <b>got</b> <b>up</b> scowling <b>and</b> {{told the}} lad {{to bring his}} bag.|$|R

5|$|Cleveland rebounded {{from its}} first {{loss of the}} season with a 31–28 victory over the Rockets. The game started slow; Groza's 21-yard field goal was the only score in the first quarter. The Rockets then went ahead by scoring a {{touchdown}} on a long pass from quarterback Vacanti to end Elroy Hirsch. Cleveland, however, piled on the points as Motley ran for a touchdown in the second quarter and Speedie caught a pass from Graham in the third. Jones added two touchdown runs in the fourth quarter, giving Cleveland a 31–14 lead. Chicago almost caught {{up at the end of}} the game, scoring two touchdowns, but the Browns held on to win. Cleveland's third-string players were on the field in the closing minutes when Chicago made its final push. Rockets rookie Ray Ramsey had three touchdowns in the game. Graham had 239 passing yards on 10 completions. Speedie caught half of them, gaining 166 yards. His touchdown came after he dropped to the ground to grab a 17-yard pass from Graham. He faked a backward lateral while on the ground, which drew Chicago's defense away from him, and then <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> ran into the end zone.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a singles match in which WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin defended against the Undertaker. Originally, Shane and Vince McMahon were {{supposed}} to be the guest referees, but due to storyline purposes, Pat Patterson, an accomplice of Vince McMahon, replaced Vince, who had had his ankle broken earlier in the event, in order to prevent Shane from helping The Undertaker. Patterson, however, was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker executed a chokeslam on him. The Undertaker and Austin wrestled inconclusively until Austin hit The Undertaker on the head with a folding chair. As Austin went to cover the Undertaker, Gerald Brisco, another accomplice of Vince, came down to the ring to replace Patterson and officiated the unsuccessful pinfall attempt by Austin. Like his partner Patterson, Brisco was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker attacked him. Vince then came down to the ring as another referee replacement, but when Austin forcefully pulled the Undertaker's head over his shoulders to perform a stunner, Shane prevented him from performing a three count. As Vince and Shane argued, Austin <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> confronted Vince, at which point Shane shoved Vince into Austin, who fell into a roll-up by The Undertaker, and then performed a fast count to give him the victory and the WWF Title.|$|E

25|$|The blow {{failed to}} kill Trotsky instantly; he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> grappled with Mercader.

25|$|As {{they ate}} bread {{together}} there at Mizpah, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and ten men with him <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> struck down Gedaliah son of Ahikam son Shaphan with the sword and killed him, because {{the king of}} Babylon had appointed him governor in the land.|$|E

25|$|I {{should have}} liked to have been there if only to have <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> said, 'If Mr. G's Home Rule Bill had been passed 30 years ago could Ireland have been worse than now? Would it have not been better?' And then fallen dead like Lord Chatham.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the drivers}} said Duggan ran toward him with outstretched arms. The car, a BMW, clipped him with the wing mirror.

25|$|On 2 November 2012, as Henry {{was telling}} the story of how he had injured his finger the {{previous}} day, his co-presenters and crew slowly left the set, until Henry was left sitting on his own at the desk, in the dark. He <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> left, before the show cut to a commercial break, after which everybody had returned.|$|E

25|$|In 1820 Kilmaurs Parish {{had only}} four freeholders {{qualified}} {{to vote and}} Dreghorn had only five, these being the proprietors of Cunninghamhead, Annock Lodge, Langlands (2) and Warwickhill. On Saturday, 3 March 1827 a remarkable snow-storm hit Ayrshire. The snow lay up to twenty feet deep in places and it snowed for twenty-four hours. A strong wind <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> drifts covered even {{the tops of the}} hedges so the roads were all but hidden.|$|E
25|$|Realising his section {{were taking}} heavy fire and {{were likely to}} be killed, Budd <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> rushed {{straight}} through the corn {{in the direction of the}} Taliban, now just 20 metres away. Budd opened up on them in fully automatic mode with his rifle, and contact was immediately lost, but the Taliban fire lessened and allowed the rest of his section to withdraw back to safety so the casualties could be treated.|$|E
25|$|On {{the next}} day, he {{presided over a}} public meeting convened to pray for the good health and {{wellbeing}} of Mahatma Gandhi.

This was the single occasion when Guru had ever prayed in public.|$|E
