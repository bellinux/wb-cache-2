40|$|Providing unambiguous, succinct {{descriptions}} of routes for pedestrians to follow is very challenging. Route descriptions {{vary according to}} many things, such as route length and complexity, availability of easily identifiable landmarks, and personal preferences. It {{is well known that}} the inclusion of a variety of landmarks facilitates route following – either at key decision points, or as a confirmatory cue. Many of the existing solutions, however, behave like car navigation systems and do not include references to such landmarks. The broader ambition of this research is the automatic generation of route descriptions that cater specifically {{to the needs of the}} pedestrian. More specifically this research describes empirical evidence gathered to identify the information requirements for an automated pedestrian navigation system. The results of three experiments helped to identify the criteria that govern the relative saliency of features of interest within an urban environment. There are a large variety of features of interest (together with their descriptions) that can be used as <b>directional</b> <b>aids</b> within route descriptions (for example buildings, statues, monuments, hills, and roads). A set of variables were developed in order to measure the saliency of the different classes of features. The experiments revealed that the most important measures of saliency included name, size, age, and colour. This empirical work formed the basis of the development of a pedestrian navigation system that incorporated the automatic identification of features of interest using the City of Edinburgh as the study area. Additionally the system supported the calculation of the saliency of a feature of interest, the development of an intervisibility model for the route to be navigated to determine the best feature of interest to use at each decision point along the route. Finally, the pedestrian navigation system was evaluated against route descriptions gathered from a random set of individuals to see how efficiently the system reflected the more natural and richer route description that people typically generate. This work shows that modelling features of interest is the key to the automatic generation of route descriptions that can be readily understood and followed by pedestrians...|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} types of IAPs: {{precision}} approach (PA), approach with vertical guidance (APV), and nonprecision approach (NPA). A PA uses a navigation system that provides course and glidepath deviation. Examples include precision approach radar (PAR), instrument landing system (ILS), and GBAS landing system (GLS). An APV also uses a navigation system for course and glidepath deviation, just not to the same standards as a PA. Examples include baro-VNAV, localizer type <b>directional</b> <b>aid</b> (LDA) with glidepath, LNAV/VNAV and LPV. An NPA uses a navigation system for course deviation but does not provide glidepath information. These approaches include VOR, NDB and LNAV. NPAs are flown to a minimum descent altitude (MDA).|$|R

40|$|Abstract—A sound {{localization}} aid {{based on}} eyeglasses with three microphones and four vibrators was {{tested in a}} sound-treated acoustic test room and in an ordinary office. A digital signal-processing algorithm provided a determination of the source angle, which was transformed into eight vibrator codes each corresponding to a 45 ˚ sector.

5000|$|A {{localizer}} type <b>directional</b> <b>aid</b> (LDA) {{is a type}} of localizer-based {{instrument approach}} to an airport. It is used in places where, due to terrain and other factors, the localizer antenna array is not aligned with the runway it serves. In these cases, the localizer antenna array may be offset (i.e. pointed or aimed) {{in such a way that}} the approach course it projects no longer lies along the extended runway centerline (which is the norm for non-offset and non-LDA localizer systems). If the angle of offset is thirty degrees or less, the facility is classified as an offset localizer. If the offset angle is greater than thirty degrees, the facility is classified as a localizer-type <b>directional</b> <b>aid</b> (LDA). As a [...] "directional aid," [...] and only a Category I (CAT I) approach, rather than a full-fledged instrument landing system (ILS), the LDA is more commonly used to help the pilot safely reach a point near the runway environs, where he or she hopefully can see the runway, at which point he or she will proceed and land visually, as opposed to (for example) full Category III (CAT III) ILS systems that allow a pilot to fly, without visual references, very close to the runway surface (usually about 100ft) depending on the exact equipment in the aircraft and on the ground. [...] An LDA uses exactly the same equipment to create the course as a standard localizer used in ILS. An LDA approach also is designed with a normal course width, which is typically 3 to 6 degrees. (At each [...] "edge-of-course," [...] commonly 1.5 or 3 degrees left and right of course, the transmitted signal is created in such a way as to ensure full-scale CDI needle deflection at and beyond these edges, so the pilot will never falsely believe that he is intercepting the course outside of the actual course area. The area between these full-scale needle deflections is what defines the course width.) An LDA approach (considered a non-precision approach) may have one or more marker beacons, perhaps a DME, and in rare instances a glide slope, just as other precision approaches have, such as ILS approaches.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{two types}} of hearing aids were used. Both aids had the same {{frequency}} characteristics for frontal sound, but one employed an omnidirectional microphone {{and the other a}} directional microphone. The frequency characteristics of both hearing aids were measured for five azimuths on KEMAR and in situ in 12 normal-hearing subjects. For these subjects we also determined the speech reception threshold (SRT) with background noise in two rooms with different reverberation times. The direction of the speech stimuli was always frontal; the direction of the noise was varied. Additionally, directional hearing was measured with short noise bursts from eight loudspeakers surrounding the subject. In the less reverberant room, sounds coming from behind were less amplified by the hearing <b>aid</b> with the <b>directional</b> microphone than by the one with the omnidirectional microphone. In this room the monaural SRT values were largely determined by the level of the background noise. For the <b>directional</b> hearing <b>aids</b> there was an extra binaural advantage which depended on the direction of the background noise. Only for low-frequency noise bursts was directional hearing better with <b>directional</b> hearing <b>aids.</b> In the more reverberant room, no distinct differences between the frequency characteristics of the two hearing aid types were measured.

While they offer substantial improvements in SNR over conventional <b>directional</b> hearing <b>aids,</b> the benefits (and possible limitations) of these devices in realistic, complex listening situations have not yet been fully explored. In this study we evaluated the performance of two experimental binaural beamformers. Design: Testing was carried out using a horizontal loudspeaker array. Background noise was created using recorded conversations. Performance measures included speech intelligibility, localization in noise, acceptable noise level, subjective ratings, and a novel dynamic speech intelligibility measure. Study sample: Participants were 27 listeners with bilateral hearing loss, fitted with BTE prototypes that could be switched between conventional directional or binaural beamformer microphone modes. Results: Relative to the conventional directional microphones, both binaural beamformer modes were generally superior for tasks involving fixed frontal targets, but not always for situations involving dynamic target locations.

40|$|Abstract. The oil {{industry}} uses geomagnetic field informa-tion to <b>aid</b> <b>directional</b> drilling operations when {{drilling for oil}} and gas offshore.

Although the most ac-curate method of achieving this is through a gyroscopic sur-vey, this can be time consuming and expensive. An alterna-tive method is a magnetic survey, where measurements while drilling (MWD) are made along the well by magnetometers housed in a tool within the drill string. These MWD mag-netic surveys require estimates of the Earth’s magnetic field at the drilling location to correct the downhole magnetome-ter readings.

30|$|The robotic {{drive system}} worked well, with {{the search and}} <b>directional</b> {{functions}} <b>aiding</b> with set-up and re-acquisition of signal if {{it needed to be}} optimized. The algorithms for these two functions appeared to work well, finding the optimal angle and position of insonation. This, in the author’s opinion, was a massive “time-saver”, preventing the need to loosen the head-band or drives and manually adjust the TCD probe. Especially important in patients with numerous monitors in situ, where repeated loosening and manipulation could potentially lead to disruption of {{one or more of these}} other monitors. This advantage cannot be overstated, as the presence of automated robotic adjustment of the probe both during the initial set-up phase and during episodes of frame shift is invaluable. With this step forward in technology, the ability to obtain extended duration, mostly uninterrupted, CBFV recordings is achievable. This allows for continuous non-invasive assessment of various aspects of cerebrovascular physiology using this technology. This includes continuous measures of CBFV, pulsatility index, and cerebrovascular reactivity (in the presence of finger-cuff based continuous non-invasive blood pressure), to name a few. As robotic TCD device technology continues to improve, we are likely to see further widespread application across various pathologies, obtaining longer and higher quality recordings. This is a step towards more non-invasive means of continuous cerebral monitoring.|$|R
