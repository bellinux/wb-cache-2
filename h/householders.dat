5|$|The {{inscriptions}} in South India suggest sallekhana {{was originally}} an ascetic practice which later extended to Jain <b>householders.</b> Its importance {{as an ideal}} death in the spiritual life of <b>householders</b> ceased by about the 12th century. The practice was revived in 1955 by the Digambara monk Acharya Santisagara.|$|E
5|$|Brahmacharya (Chastity)Abstinence {{from sex}} and sensual pleasures for Jain monks, {{faithfulness}} to one's partner for Jain <b>householders.</b>|$|E
5|$|In Jainism, both ascetics and <b>householders</b> (śrāvaka) have {{to follow}} five major vows (vratas). Ascetics observe these fives vows more {{strictly}} and therefore observe complete abstinence.|$|E
50|$|Alston Scott <b>Householder</b> (Rockford, Illinois, USA, 5 May 1904 - Malibu, California, USA, 4 July 1993) was an American {{mathematician}} {{who specialized}} in mathematical biology and numerical analysis, inventor of the <b>Householder</b> transformation and of <b>Householder's</b> method. Married to Belle <b>Householder</b> (died 1975), children: John, Jackie and remarried 1984 to Heidi <b>Householder,</b> née Vogg.|$|R
50|$|In linear algebra, a <b>Householder</b> {{transformation}} (also {{known as}} <b>Householder</b> reflection or elementary reflector) is a linear transformation that describes a reflection about a plane or hyperplane containing the origin. The <b>Householder</b> transformation {{was introduced in}} 1958 by Alston Scott <b>Householder.</b>|$|R

5|$|While Sallekhana is {{prescribed}} for both <b>householders</b> and ascetics, Jain texts describe conditions {{when it is}} appropriate. It should not be observed by a householder without guidance of a Jain ascetic.|$|E
5|$|Chhinnamasta is {{typically}} worshipped at midnight {{along with the}} other Mahavidyas at Kali Puja, the festival of Kali. However, <b>householders</b> are cautioned not to worship her. The Bakhrabad area of Cuttack district and the 86 Palli pandal of Kolkata have unique traditions of worshipping Chinnamasta, instead of Kali, on Kali Puja.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{was also}} {{carried out in}} Giffnock, between 1850 and 1926. The coal {{produced}} was of a very poor quality and was of little value to <b>householders.</b> The main use of Giffnock coal was with commercial and industrial customers such as Busby Gas Works.|$|E
25|$|According to the 2007–2011 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, {{there are}} 13,395 households, 42.8% are married couples living together, 2.6% have a male <b>householder</b> with no wife present, and 22.5% have a female <b>householder</b> with no husband present. 32.2% are non-family households, with 28.4% have a <b>householder</b> living alone and 3.8% having a <b>householder</b> not living alone.|$|R

5|$|Sallekhana is a vow {{available}} to both for Jain ascetics and <b>householders.</b> Historic evidence such as nishidhi engravings suggest sallekhana was observed by {{both men and}} women, including queens, in Jain history. However, in the modern era, death through sallekhana has been a relatively uncommon event.|$|E
5|$|The custom {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 1800, with subsequent accounts {{of it being}} produced into the early twentieth century. According to these, the Mari Lwyd was a tradition performed at Christmas time by groups of men. They would form into teams to accompany the horse on its travels around the local area, and although the makeup of such groups varied, they typically included an individual to carry the horse, a leader, and individuals dressed as stock characters such as Punch and Judy. The team would carry the Mari Lwyd to local houses, where they would request entry {{through the medium of}} song. The <b>householders</b> would be expected to deny them entry, again through song, and the two sides would continue their responses to one another in this manner. If the <b>householders</b> eventually relented, then the team would be permitted entry and given food and drink.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{returned}} to the custom in his 1804 work Letters Written During a Tour Through South Wales, in the year 1803, and at Other Times. Here he provided a clearer discussion than before, making it apparent that teams accompanying a man dressed as a horse or bull toured the local area from Christmas until after Twelfth Day, {{and that they were}} given food or money to leave the <b>householders</b> alone.|$|E
50|$|<b>Householder</b> Franchise or census {{suffrage}} {{is where}} a homeowner {{has the right to}} vote in an election. This is a limited form of suffrage, but different from equal voting because, to borrow a dictum, <b>householder</b> franchise is one Household, one vote because it entitles only the <b>householder</b> one vote.|$|R

In 1996, <b>Householder</b> ran for State Representative of Ohio’s 78th district, challenging incumbent democrat Mary Abel of Athens. <b>Householder</b> defeated Abel with 55.03% of the vote. He would be elected three more times.|$|R
5|$|Over the Hedge is set {{immediately}} after {{the events of the}} animated film. Gladys Sharp, president of the homeowners' association, plans to bulldoze the forest in order to build a swimming pool. She has been joined by a new character, the taxidermist. The animals decide to lure endangered species to the forest in order to have it declared a protected habitat, preventing its destruction. The <b>householders</b> have been warned about RJ and company's intentions, and have created traps from everyday objects to repel the thieves.|$|E
5|$|Some hymns narrate that Chinnamasta likes {{blood and}} thus is offered blood sacrifices at some shrines. The Shaktisamgama Tantra says that only brave souls (viras) should follow Vamamarga worship to the goddess. The Shakta Pramoda warns that {{improper}} worship brings severe consequences, with Chhinnamasta beheading the person and drinking his blood. Further, it explains the worship rituals {{to be followed by}} <b>householders</b> and those to be followed by renouncers. The Todala Tantra mentions that, as part of Chhinnamasta's worship, Shiva or his fierce form, Bhairava, be worshipped as Kabandha ("headless trunk") as the goddess's consort.|$|E
5|$|The Chintpurni ("She who {{fulfills}} one's wishes"), Himachal Pradesh {{temple of}} Chhinnamastika, {{is one of}} the Shakti Peethas (considered the holiest goddess temples) and is where the goddess Sati's forehead (mastaka) fell. Here, Chhinnamasta is interpreted as the severed-headed one as well as the foreheaded-one. The central icon is a pindi, an abstract form of Devi. While <b>householders</b> worship the goddess as a form of the goddess Durga, ascetic sadhus view her as the Tantric severed-headed goddess.|$|E
5000|$|When {{incumbent}} state Representative Bill Hayes {{decided to}} run for Licking County Prosecutor in 2016, <b>Householder</b> decided to try and take his old seat back, renamed district 72 after redistricting. [...] Facing Coshocton councilmember Cliff N. Biggers, Coshocton being a county <b>Householder</b> never represented, <b>Householder</b> won the Republican nomination with almost 64% of the vote.|$|R
40|$|The <b>Householder</b> {{transformation}} {{is considered to}} be desirable among various unitary transformations due to its superior computational efficiency and robust numerical stability. Specifically, the <b>Householder</b> transformation outperforms the Givens rotation and the modified Gram-Schmidt methods in numerical stability under finite-precision implementations, as well as requiring fewer arithmetical operations. Consequently, the QR decomposition based on the <b>Householder</b> {{transformation is}} promising for VLSI implementation and real-time high throughput modern signal processing. In this paper, a recursive complex <b>Householder</b> transformation with a fast initialization algorithm is proposed and its associated parallel/pipelined architecture is also considered. Then, a complex <b>Householder</b> transformation based recursive least-squares algorithm with a fast initialization is presented. Its associated systolic array processing architecture is also considered...|$|R
50|$|There were 2,409 {{households}} out {{of which}} 31.6% had {{children under the age}} of 18 living with them, 60.2% were married couples living together, 3.8% had a male <b>householder</b> with no wife present, 9.0% had a female <b>householder</b> with no husband present, and 27.0% were non-families. Of all households 21.8% had a <b>householder</b> that lived alone and 8.4% had a <b>householder</b> that lived alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.66 and the average family size was 3.13.|$|R
5|$|The eastern {{market for}} {{ice in the}} U.S. was also changing. Cities like New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia saw their {{population}} boom {{in the second half}} of the century; New York tripled in size between 1850 and 1890, for example. This drove up the demand for ice considerably across the region. By 1879, <b>householders</b> in the eastern cities were consuming two thirds of a ton (601kg) of ice a year, being charged 40 cents ($9.30) per 100 pounds (45kg); 1,500 wagons were needed just to deliver ice to consumers in New York.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 Hindley, her grandmother, and Brady were rehoused {{as part of}} {{the post-war}} slum {{clearances}} in Manchester, to 16Wardle Brook Avenue in the new overspill estate of Hattersley. Brady and Hindley became friendly with Patricia Hodges, an 11-year-old girl who lived at 12Wardle Brook Avenue. Hodges accompanied the two on their trips to Saddleworth Moor to collect peat, something that many <b>householders</b> on the new estate did to improve the soil in their gardens, which were full of clay and builder's rubble. She remained unharmed; living only a few doors away, her disappearance would have been easily solved.|$|E
5|$|The {{period after}} {{the defeat of}} the Spanish Armada in 1588 brought new {{difficulties}} for Elizabeth that lasted until the end of her reign. The conflicts with Spain and in Ireland dragged on, the tax burden grew heavier, and the economy was hit by poor harvests and the cost of war. Prices rose and the standard of living fell. During this time, repression of Catholics intensified, and Elizabeth authorised commissions in 1591 to interrogate and monitor Catholic <b>householders.</b> To maintain the illusion of peace and prosperity, she increasingly relied on internal spies and propaganda. In her last years, mounting criticism reflected a decline in the public's affection for her.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} <b>Householder</b> {{reduction of}} a rectangular sparse matrix to small band upper triangular form. Using block <b>Householder</b> transformations gives good orthogonality, is computationally efficient, and has good potential for parallelization. The algorithm {{is similar to}} the standard dense <b>Householder</b> reduction used as part of the usual dense SVD computation. For the sparse algorithm, the original sparse matrix is accessed only for sparse matrix dense matrix (SMDM) multi-plications. For a triangular bandwidth of k + 1, the dense matrices are the k rows or columns of a block <b>Householder</b> transformation. Using an initial random block <b>Householder</b> transformation allows re-liable computation of a collection of largest singular values. Some other potential applications are in finding low rank matrix approximations and in solving least squares problems. ...|$|R

5|$|Following the war, {{millions}} of returning soldiers were still {{not entitled to}} vote. This posed another dilemma for politicians since they could {{be seen to be}} withholding the vote from the very men who had just fought to preserve the British democratic political system. The Representation of the People Act 1918 attempted to solve the problem, enfranchising all adult males {{as long as they were}} over 21 years old and were resident <b>householders.</b> It also gave the vote to women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. The enfranchisement of this latter group was accepted as recognition of the contribution made by women defence workers, though the actual feelings of members of parliament (MPs) at the time is questioned. In the same year the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918 allowed women over 21 to stand as MPs.|$|E
5|$|In 1832 the Great Reform Act enfranchised {{those who}} owned or leased land worth £10 {{or more and}} the Second Reform Act {{extended}} this to all <b>householders</b> paying £10 or more in rent per annum, effectively enfranchising the skilled working class, so by 1868 the percentage of voters in Peterborough had risen to about 20% of the population. The Third Reform Act extended {{the provisions of the}} previous act to the counties and the Fourth Reform Act widened suffrage further by abolishing practically all property qualifications for men and by enfranchising women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. This system, known as universal manhood suffrage, was first used in the 1918 general election. However, full electoral equality wouldn't occur until the Fifth Reform Act ten years later.|$|E
5|$|The Act also {{extended}} the franchise. In county constituencies, {{in addition to}} forty-shilling freeholders, franchise rights were extended to owners of land in copyhold worth £10 and holders of long-term leases (more than sixty years) on land worth £10 and holders of medium-term leases (between twenty and sixty years) on land worth £50 and to tenants-at-will paying an annual rent of £50. In borough constituencies all male <b>householders</b> living in properties worth at least £10 a year were given {{the right to vote}} – a measure which introduced to all boroughs a standardised form of franchise for the first time. Existing borough electors retained a lifetime right to vote, however they had qualified, provided they were resident in the boroughs in which they were electors. In those boroughs which had freemen electors, voting rights were to be enjoyed by future freemen as well provided their freemanship was acquired through birth or apprenticeship and they too were resident.|$|E

50|$|Other {{orthogonalization}} algorithms use <b>Householder</b> transformations or Givens rotations. The algorithms using <b>Householder</b> transformations {{are more}} stable than the stabilized Gram-Schmidt process. On the other hand, the Gram-Schmidt process produces the th orthogonalized vector after the th iteration, while orthogonalization using <b>Householder</b> reflections produces all the vectors only at the end. This makes only the Gram-Schmidt process applicable for iterative methods like the Arnoldi iteration.|$|R
