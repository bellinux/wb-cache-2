40|$|A {{simple method}} is {{described}} for the rapid quantitative analysis of N-acetyl-p-amino-phenol (APAP) in urine. APAP and its conjugates {{present in the}} urine following the ingestion of acetophenetidin, APAP or acetanilid, are hydrolyzed with acid to p. aminophenol. This compound is coupled with phenol {{in the presence of}} hypobromite to form an <b>indophenol</b> <b>dye</b> whose concentration is determined spectrophotometrically. Application of this method to a study of 3 human subjects treated with acetopheneti-din is described. HE 1) ESPIIEAD USE of analgesic drugs, such as acetophenetnhn and N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), which give rise to conjugated APAP in the urine, has stimulated an interest for a simple and rapid method which could be routinely used in clinical laboratories for the detection and quantitation of these drugs and their metabolites. The need for such a test has been pointed out by recent reports indicating that the abuse of certain of ti 1 ese analgesic drugs may Iea(l to Iheph-ropathies (1, 2). The method previously described by Brodie and Axel-rod (3, 4) for the determination of conjugated APAP involves acid hydrolysis followed by extraction of tile resulting p-aminophenol into ethyl ether and then its extraction from the organic solvent into dilute acid. The p-aminophenol was then reacted with phenol in the presence of sodium hypobromite to form an <b>indophenol</b> <b>dye</b> whose concentration was determined in a spectrophotometer. The method presented here for the determination of APAP in urine is simple enough for routine use in the clinical laboratory.

Linearity was obeyed in the range of 2. 00 - 125. 00 ng mL- 1 of ammonia. The detection limit of the method was 1. 00 ng mL- 1 of ammonia. The interference effect of some common ions was also tested.

40|$|Science Fund for Creative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China [41121091]An {{automated}} calorimetric {{method for}} the on-line determination of trace ammonium in seawater was established using a flow injection technique {{coupled with a}} 2. 5 -m liquid waveguide capillary cell. Using low ammonium seawater as a carrier, a sample was injected into the carrier and mixed with reagents to form <b>indophenol</b> blue <b>dye,</b> which was monitored at a wavelength of 690 nm. Different strategies of reagent injection were investigated to obtain a lower reagent blank and a higher detection sensitivity. Experimental parameters were optimized using a univariate experimental design, and the matrix effect of seawater was preliminarily investigated. The proposed method had high sensitivity with a detection limit of 3. 6 nmol. L- 1. The linearity was 10 to 500 nmol. L- 1 and the upper limit could be extended to 30 mu mol. L- 1 by choosing a less sensitive detection wavelength or lower reaction temperature. The recoveries were between 95. 0 and 104. 3 % and the relative standard deviation was 4. 4 % (n = 7) for an aged seawater sample spiked with 50 nmol. L- 1 ammonium. The sample throughput was 22 h(- 1). The analytical results obtained with the proposed method showed good agreement with those using reference fluorescence methods. Compared with the normal indophenol blue (off-line) method, the proposed method was superior due to its lower reagent consumption, greater convenience, higher sample throughput, wider linear range (10 nmol. L- 1 to 30 mu mol. L- 1), as well as higher sensitivity. The method was applied in-field in Wuyuan Bay for 24 h on-line monitoring of ammonium concentrations in the surface seawater. In addition, it was also used to analyze surface seawater samples collected from the South China Sea {{for the study of}} ammonium distribution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

These included five systems, with an Eh range from + 0. 454 v. to – 0. 288 v., a total range of 0. 742 v. When proper regard was given to buffering against acidity changes, and concentration changes of Na or K ions in the oxidized and reduced forms, no significant effect upon the bioelectric potential was found: 1. When an oxidant or reductant (K ferri- or ferrocyanide) was applied instead of an equivalent normality of an "indifferent" salt (KCl). 2. In changing from a given oxidant to its corresponding reductant (ferri- to ferrocyanide; oxidized to leuco-dye, etc.). 3. When a mixture of 2 <b>dyes,</b> (<b>indophenol</b> with positive E' 0, and safranin with negative E' 0) was oxidized and reduced, to give better poising at the extremes.

Paracetamol reacts with sodium hypochlorite forming N-acetyl-p-benzoquinoneimine which then reacts with sodium salicylate in sodium hydroxide solution yielding a blue <b>indophenol</b> <b>dye</b> which was measured at 640 nm in the pH range of 9. 5 - 10. 0.

The vitamin C and total lipids contents were also titrated with 2, 6 dichlorophenol <b>indophenol</b> <b>dye</b> and extracted with hexane in a soxhlet apparatus for 6 h, respectively. The moisture content was estimated by drying in an oven at 105 °C until constant weight. The beta-carotene contents of dried steamed squashes were 2834. 75 ± 11. 22; 3043. 91 ± 1. 65 and 5917. 83 ± 720. 49 μg/ 100 g serving of C. pepo, C. moshata and C. maxima, respectively. The vitamin C contents ranged from 5. 70 ± 0. 32 μg/ 100 g serving (C. moshata) to 11. 81 ± 0. 19 μg/ 100 g serving (C. maxima). Total lipids ranged from 6. 22 ± 0. 00 g/ 100 g serving (C. pepo) to 7. 09 ± 0. 11 g/ 100 g serving (C. moshata) and the water remaining ranged from 6. 39 ± 1. 18 g/ 100 g serving (C. maxima) to 8. 19 ± 0. 70 serving (C. pepo).

In the developed method, successive passage of the complex, previously formed in the flowing stream, and eluent through the flow cell and continuous monitoring of the process provided the analytical information needed to determine pyridoxine. Pharmaceutical samples containing Vitamin B 6 were previously dissolved in 0. 1 mol l− 1 phosphate buffer solution (pH 7. 5) and a sample volume of 235 μl was injected directly into carrier stream consisting of a mixture of methanol and 0. 1 mol l− 1 phosphate buffer solution adjusted to pH 7. 0 (1 + 1, v/v). The blue <b>indophenol</b> <b>dye</b> produced from the reaction between pyridoxine and N,N-diethyl p-phenylenediamine after oxidation by potassium hexacyanoferrate(III) was quantitatively retained on C 18 support and the spectrophotometric detection was performed simultaneously at 633 nm. The retained complex was quickly eluted from C 18 material with the eluent stream consisting of a mixture of methanol and 0. 01 mol l− 1 HCl (6 + 4, v/v). The {{results showed that the}} proposed method is simple, rapid and the analytical response is linear in the concentration range of 0. 5 – 10 and 0. 2 – 4 mg l− 1 using 235 and 860 μl of sample, respectively.

Electron diffraction techniques indicated that isolated Ag structures were composed of a single crystalline phase or were multiply-twinned, both having a lattice constant of 4. 05 A;Adsorption of iodide and bromide ions on the silver surface was monitored by surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy. A characteristic halide-metal stretching vibration was observed at 112 cm- 1 for I- and at 156 cm- 1 for Br-. Extinction spectra of the halide-modified Ag colloids showed a frequency-shift and damping of the surface plasmon resonance band assigned to particle aggregation. This was confirmed using two dimensional arrays of particles in which the surface-modifier caused only damping with no change in the plasmon frequency;Addition of cytochrome c to the halide-modified colloid resulted in the reduction of the protein. Competitive binding of I- ions between cytochrome c and the metal necessitated the use of a redox active <b>indophenol</b> <b>dye</b> for quantitative measurements of reduction efficiencies. Two distinct processes were identified: reduction at iodide coverages up to one monolayer on the Ag surface and reduction in the presence of excess I- in solution. The latter was characterized by I- reacting with silver in a 1 : 1 stoichiometry to form molecular AgI. The former, which resulted in only 5 % reduction of the electron acceptors, was a consequence of partial charge transfer from I- to the metal, producing a unique iodide-Ag surface complex different than molecular AgI;Raman spectra of the complex excited at 413 nm and at temperatures less than 150 K contained a strong vibrational progression with a fundamental band at 123 cm- 1 and up to six overtones.
