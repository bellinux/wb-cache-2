Previous studies of traffic modeling in cellular networks {{have tended to}} derive distributions to fit the measured data for the arrival rate and call holding processes or derive expressions for call blocking on the {{air interface}} for different handover and channel assignment procedures.

However, there have not been a large number of studies published on how accurate or otherwise (and under what circumstances) the <b>Erlang</b> <b>B</b> model is in modeling air interface call blocking in practical cellular networks. In this paper call blocking measurements of the air interface of a “real ” cellular network are presented. A statistical analysis is undertaken which shows that the measured data is correctly modeled by <b>Erlang</b> <b>B</b> at a level of significance of 0. 05 when the number of channels are greater than 12 and the blocking experienced is greater than 1 %.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new Gaussian approximations for {{the cumulative}} distribution function P(A¿ = s) of a Poisson random variable A¿ with mean ¿. Using an integral transformation, we first bring the Poisson distribution into quasi-Gaussian form, which permits evaluation {{in terms of the}} normal distribution function F. The quasi-Gaussian form contains an implicitly defined function y, which is closely related to the Lambert W-function. A detailed analysis of y leads to a powerful asymptotic expansion and sharp bounds on P(A¿ = s). The results for P(A¿ = s) differ from most classical results related to the central limit theorem in that the leading term F(ß), with ß = (s - ¿) /v¿, is replaced by F(a), where a is a simple function of s that converges to ß as s tends to 8. Changing ß into a turns out to increase precision for small and moderately large values of s. The results for P(A¿ = s) lead to similar results related to the <b>Erlang</b> <b>B</b> formula. The asymptotic expansion for <b>Erlang's</b> <b>B</b> is shown to give rise to accurate approximations; the obtained bounds seem to be the sharpest in the literature thus far...|$|R

Following this way, we get explicit formulas for PDAC problem. The proposed formulas deliver high-performance computing of network resources assignment under PDAC requirements. Thus, an efficient method for proportional differentiated admission control implementation has been provided.|$|R
40|$|Relay {{deployment}} in orthogonal {{frequency division}} multiple access (OFDMA) based cellular networks helps in coverage extension and/or capacity improvement. To quantify capacity improvement, blocking probability of voice call is typically calculated using <b>Erlang</b> <b>B</b> formula. This calculation {{is based on the}} assumption that all users require same amount of resources to satisfy their rate requirement. However, in an OFDMA system, each user requires different number of subcarriers to meet its rate requirement. This resource requirement depends on the signal to interference ratio (SIR) experienced by a user. Therefore, the <b>Erlang</b> <b>B</b> formula can not be employed to compute blocking probability in an OFDMA network. In this paper, we determine an analytical expression to compute the blocking probability in a relay based cellular OFDMA network. We determine an expression of the probability distribution of the user's resource requirement based on its experienced SIR. Then, we classify the users into various classes depending upon their subcarrier requirement. We consider the system to be a multi-dimensional system with different classes and evaluate the blocking probability using the multi-dimensional Erlang loss formulas. This model is useful in the performance evaluation, design, planning of resources and call admission control in a relay based cellular OFDMA networks like long term evolution...|$|R

For example, in a system where there is no queuing, the GoS may be that no more than 1 call in 100 is blocked (i.e., rejected) due to all circuits being in use (a GoS of 0.01), which becomes the target probability of call blocking, Pb, when using the <b>Erlang</b> <b>B</b> formula.|$|R

40|$|The {{overflow}} priority classification approximation (OPCA) and Erlang&# 039;s fixed-point approximation (EFPA) {{are distinct}} methods for estimating blocking probabilities in overflow loss networks. Mounting numerical evidence {{has indicated that}} OPCA provides superior accuracy than EFPA in many circumstances. Furthermore, it has been proven that P EFPA ≤ P OPCA for a symmetric overflow loss network called the distributed server model, where P x is the blocking probability estimate yielded by approximation x {EFPA, OPCA}. The distributed server model is an ideal "proving ground" because the exact blocking probability, P exact, can be calculated with the <b>Erlang</b> <b>B</b> formula, yet the state dependencies caused by mutual overflow are retained. The present article proves the OPC Conjecture, P OPCA ≤ P exact. This new result establishes that OPCA is always equally or more accurate relative to EFPA for the distributed server model and suggests OPCA has utility in more general overflow loss networks. The proof of P OPCA ≤ P exact {{turned out to be}} challenging, since OPCA is remarkably close to the exact solution, requiring delicate inequality arguments on the Maclaurin series of both solutions. Another contribution is the derivation of new tight bounds and limiting regimes for the blocking probabilities yielded by OPCA and EFPA in the case of critical loading. The simple and tight lower bound derived for OPCA can serve as a tight lower bound for the <b>Erlang</b> <b>B</b> blocking probability in the case of critical loading...|$|R
