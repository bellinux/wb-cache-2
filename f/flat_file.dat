5|$|The EMBL Nucleotide Sequence Database uses a <b>flat</b> <b>file</b> {{plaintext}} {{format to}} represent and store data which is typically {{referred to as}} EMBL-Bank format. EMBL-Bank format uses a different syntax to the records in DDBJ and GenBank, though each format uses certain standardised nomenclature, such as taxonomies {{as defined by the}} NCBI Taxon database. Each line of an EMBL-format file beings with a two-letter code, such as AC to label the accession number and KW for a list of keywords relevant to the record; each record ends with //.|$|E

2500|$|The Macintosh {{originally}} {{used the}} Macintosh File System (MFS), a <b>flat</b> <b>file</b> system {{with only one}} level of folders. This was quickly replaced in 1985 by the Hierarchical File System (HFS), which had a true directory tree. Both file systems are otherwise compatible. An improved file system named HFS Plus ("HFS+" [...] or [...] "Mac OS Extended") was announced in 1997 and implemented in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Data storage became better {{organized}} {{after the}} development of relational database software that allowed data to be stored in different tables. [...] For example, a theoretical airline may have numerous tables such as: airplanes, employees, maintenance contractors, caterers, flights, airports, payments, tickets, etc. each containing a narrower set of more specific information than would a <b>flat</b> <b>file,</b> such as a spreadsheet. [...] These tables are related by common data fields called keys. (See: Relational model) Data can be retrieved in various specific configurations by posing a query without having to pull up a whole table. [...] This, for example, {{makes it easy to}} find a passenger's seat assignment by a variety of means such as ticket number or name, and provide only the queried information. [...] See: SQL ...|$|E
2500|$|Byrne {{left the}} college in 1973 without graduating. He broke into comics with a [...] "Fan Art Gallery" [...] piece in Marvel's promotional {{publication}} FOOM in early 1974 and by illustrating a two-page story by writer Al Hewetson in Skywald Publications' black-and-white horror magazine Nightmare #20 (Aug. 1974). He then began freelancing for Charlton Comics, making his color-comics debut with the E-Man backup feature [...] "Rog-2000", starring a robot character he'd {{created in the}} mid-1970s that colleagues Roger Stern and Bob Layton named and began using for spot illustrations in their fanzine CPL (Contemporary Pictorial Literature). A Rog-2000 story written by Stern, with art by Byrne and Layton, had gotten the attention of Charlton Comics editor Nicola Cuti, who extended Byrne an invitation. Written by Cuti, [...] "Rog-2000" [...] became one of several alternating backup features in the Charlton Comics superhero series E-Man, starting with the eight-page [...] "That Was No Lady" [...] in issue #6 (Jan. 1975). While that was Byrne's first published color-comics work, [...] "My first professional comic book sale was to Marvel, a short story called Dark Asylum' ... which languished in a <b>flat</b> <b>file</b> somewhere until it was used as filler in Giant-Size Dracula #5 , long after the first Rog story." [...] The story was plotted by Tony Isabella and written by David Anthony Kraft.|$|E

50|$|One {{criticism}} often raised {{against the}} XML format {{as a way}} to perform mass data transfer operations is that file size is significantly larger than that of <b>flat</b> <b>files,</b> which is generally reduced to the bare minimum.
