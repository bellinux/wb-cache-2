5|$|Another peace {{agreement}} between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans lasted until 1552, when Suleiman decided to attack Eger. The siege proved futile, and the Habsburg victory reversed a period of territorial losses in Hungary. Their retention of Eger gave the Austrians <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that Hungary was still contested ground and the Ottoman campaign in Hungary ended, until its revival in 1566.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{generally recognized}} that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> believe that memories were generally not the result of new neuron production. With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.|$|E
5|$|On 24 April 1952, {{a letter}} {{appeared}} in Sydney's Daily Mirror from Jacob Raith, a baker from Stanmore in Sydney, {{in response to}} a letter from Barnes's friend Stacy Atkin, which condemned the board for vetoing Barnes's selection.

5|$|Social {{rigidification}} {{became a}} common feature of Soviet society. During the Stalin {{era in the}} 1930s and 1940s, a common labourer could expect promotion to a white-collar job if he studied and obeyed Soviet authorities. In Brezhnev's Soviet Union {{this was not the}} case. Holders of attractive positions clung to them as long as possible; mere incompetence was not seen as a <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> dismiss anyone. In this way, too, the Soviet society Brezhnev passed on had become static.|$|E
5|$|The {{details of}} Bede's story, and in {{particular}} of the miraculous nature of Cædmon's poetic inspiration, are not generally accepted by scholars as being entirely accurate, but there seems no <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> doubt {{the existence of a}} poet named Cædmon. Bede's narrative has to be read {{in the context of the}} Christian belief in miracles, and it shows at the very least that Bede, an educated and intelligent man, believed Cædmon to be an important figure in the history of English intellectual and religious life.|$|E
5|$|The first {{indication}} {{of a change in}} weather was the sudden collapse of the market for specialized AI hardware in 1987.

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to change one's coat of arms, with or without adopting or appending a new surname, by Royal Licence, {{that is to say}} a licence {{in the form of a}} warrant from the Crown directed to the Kings of Arms instructing them to exemplify the transferred arms or a version of them to the licensee in his or her new name. Royal Licences are issued on the advice of Garter King of Arms and are usually dependent on there being some constraining circumstances such as a testamentary injunction (a requirement in a will) or a <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> wish to perpetuate a particular coat of arms. The Royal Licence is of no effect until and unless the exemplification is issued and recorded in the College. Royal Licences are gazetted and make a deed poll unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|Patton {{personally}} pinned a Silver Star on Leclerc, {{and brought}} with him another six Silver Stars and 25 Bronze Star Medals for {{other members of the}} 2e DB. Patton then gave Leclerc his next objective: the town of Baccarat and the bridge there over the Meurthe River. The bridge was captured before the Germans could destroy it. Haislip's XV Corps was transferred to the Seventh United States Army on 29 September, and Leclerc feared that 2e DB would be transferred to Général d'armée Jean de Lattre de Tassigny's French First Army. Leclerc regarded the First Army as being full of traitors who had supported Vichy France. Moreover, de Lattre had sacked Général de division Edgard de Larminat for Gaullist sentiments, and Leclerc had <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> fear that he might meet a similar fate.|$|E
40|$|For {{free will}} theorists, {{the problem of}} luck has been a {{constant}} source of consternation. Peter van Inwagen presents a version immune to even agent-causal conceptions of free will. However, van Inwagen’s version of the problem can be avoided if there are true propositions taking the form of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom. There are <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> think that there are, and no comparably <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> think that there are not.

For the skeptheist, we cannot know (or have <b>good</b> <b>reasons</b> <b>to</b> believe) that God exists, since there can be neither conceptual (a priori) nor empirical (a posteriori) evidence for the existence of God...|$|R

5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including testing positive for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was <b>good</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> hold the government liable.|$|E

25|$|Under the {{principles}} of stare decisis (judicial precedent), the High Court is bound by decisions of the Court of Appeal.
