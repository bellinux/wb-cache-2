25|$|With the {{beginning}} of <b>digitalization,</b> Intel launched in 1971 its first microcomputer, MCS 4, and in 1972 Hewlett Packard launched {{one of the first}} pocket calculators, HP 35. The requirements for capacitors increased in terms of lowering the equivalent series resistance (ESR) for bypass and decoupling capacitors. The manganese dioxide type of electrolyte should be better.|$|E
25|$|According to Information Minister, Sontaya Kunplome, MCOT is {{expected}} to fully complete its <b>digitalization</b> in 2012 {{as part of its}} three-year restructuring process. Each household, once equipped with the necessary equipment (set-top box or iDTV set) {{is expected}} to receive up to 19 channels, seven of which fall under MCOT and the rest for private broadcasters such as BEC-TERO which owns its channels such as TV3. Thus far, besides simulcasting Modernine TV and Television of Thailand, MCOT is test-airing MCOT 1, MCOT 2 and MCOT 3 exclusively on the digital TV platform, transmitted at UHF channel 44, modulated at 64QAM. MCOT was also expected to launch regional channels for each province and/or territory in Thailand, making it 80 MCOT television channels. BEC-TERO was expected to commence trials in March 2009.|$|E

2500|$|Interactivity {{has become}} a term {{for a number of}} new media use options {{evolving}} from the rapid dissemination of Internet access points, the <b>digitalization</b> of media, and media convergence. In 1984, Rice defined new media as communication technologies that enable or facilitate user-to-user interactivity and interactivity between user and information. Such a definition replaces the [...] "one-to-many" [...] model of traditional mass communication with the possibility of a [...] "many-to-many" [...] web of communication. Any individual with the appropriate technology can now produce his or her online media and include images, text, and sound about whatever he or she chooses. Thus the convergence of new methods of communication with new technologies shifts the model of mass communication, and radically reshapes the ways we interact and communicate with one another. In [...] "What is new media?" [...] Vin Crosbie (2002) described three different kinds of communication media. He saw Interpersonal media as [...] "one to one", Mass media as [...] "one to many", and finally New Media as Individuation Media or [...] "many to many".|$|E
2500|$|Mosterín {{acquired}} {{his initial}} logical formation at the Institut für mathematische Logik und Grundlagenforschung in Münster (Germany). He published {{the first modern}} and rigorous textbooks of logic [...] and set theory [...] in Spanish. He has worked on topics of first and second order logic, axiomatic set theory, computability and complexity. He has shown how the uniform <b>digitalization</b> of each type of symbolic object (such as chromosomes, texts, pictures, movies or pieces of music) can be considered to implement a certain positional numbering system. This result gives a precise meaning {{to the notion that}} the set of natural numbers constitutes a universal library and indeed a universal data base. Mosterín has edited the first edition of the complete works of Kurt Gödel in any language. Together with Thomas Bonk, he has edited an unpublished book of Rudolf Carnap on axiomatics (in German). He has also delved in the historical and biographical aspects of the development of modern logic, as shown in his original work on the lives of Gottlob Frege, Georg Cantor, Bertrand Russell, John von Neumann, Kurt Gödel and Alan Turing, intertwined with [...] a formal analysis of their main technical contributions.|$|E
