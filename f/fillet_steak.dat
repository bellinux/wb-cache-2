40|$|In most {{countries}} along with various food products, fish sausage is supplied in different formulas. Unfortunately, {{in our country}} because of different reasons, production and supply of fish sausage in industrial level {{has not yet been}} successful and some efforts taken, has also been doomed to failure or not welcomed. Fat fish is a rich source of poly unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and co- 3. In this research, efforts have been made to produce and enrich sausage with fish oil and maintenance of fatty acids has also been experimented using gas chromatography along with heating process. The stages of producing ground fish and fish sausage are as the following: Transferring and preparing fish, washing the cleared fish, filleting, separating <b>fillet</b> <b>steak,</b> washing and drying them, Refining meat, Producing and homogenizing mixture from basic ingredients in a cutter, filling, knotting and heat processing. The fish sausage produced by this method tried and welcomed by the subjects. In the product in which fish meat was used, the subjects was not recognized fish flavor and taste and when in addition to fish meat, fish oil was used during enrichment, the flavor and taste of fish was considered as highly acceptable. TVN measurement of the produced fish sausage was kept in the refrigerator in two month was at a maximum of 16. 5, the amount of peroxide was at a maximum 1. 5 % after the period of two months. During this period the Colony count was at maximum of 19. 5 x 104, the high maximum of the number of coliforms was 10 /gr, and for mold and yeast 83 /gr, but Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella and Clostridium perfringens were not found. The protein of the resulting product was 15 - 18 %, lipid at about 11 - 15 % and moisture 60 - 65 %. Comparing fatty acids, including unsaturated fatty acids in ground and oil fish used in producing fish sausage with those of fish sausage showed that the heat used in processing had the least effect on fatty acids of the meat and oil used here and the resulting fish sausage is considered as food for good health...|$|E

50|$|Veal {{has been}} an {{important}} ingredient in Italian, French cuisine and other mediterranian cuisine from ancient times. The veal is often in the form of cutlets, such as the Italian cotoletta or the famous Austrian dish Wiener Schnitzel. Some classic French veal dishes include fried escalopes, fried veal Grenadines (small, thick <b>fillet</b> <b>steaks),</b> stuffed paupiettes, roast joints, and blanquettes. Because veal is lower in fat than many meats, care must be taken in preparation to ensure that it does not become tough. Veal is often coated in preparation for frying or eaten with a sauce. Veal Parmigiana is a common Italian-American dish made with breaded veal cutlets.|$|R

40|$|Master's thesis in Industrial economicsThis study {{analyses}} {{price transmission}} from Norwegian export prices of fresh salmon to retail prices of consumer salmon products in France and UK. For different reasons, changes in salmon export prices {{do not need}} to be fully transmitted to retail prices of salmon products based on Atlantic salmon from Norway. This study tries to shed light on these price links between different levels in the value chain. Specifically, this study attempts to quantify the degree of price transmission on a broader set of consumer salmon products than has been analyzed in earlier studies. Moreover, this is the first study that analyzes differences in price transmission between branded products and supermarkets’ private label salmon products. The results from this study show a high degree of price transmission from Norwegian export prices to retail prices of natural fresh products such as <b>fillets,</b> <b>steaks</b> and whole. However, price transmission to retail prices decreases as more processing are involved; for fresh whole salmon price transmission is complete, while in highly value added products such as fresh ready main meal the price transmission can be close to zero. The econometric results further suggest that the transmission is higher from the Norwegian export price to the retail prices of private label salmon products compared to prices of branded salmon products. Again, this is an indicator that there are higher marketing costs for branded products. The increasing range of salmon products marketed to satisfy the different consumer tastes therefore reduces transmission from salmon export price to retail prices. Nonetheless, supermarkets’ private label products appear to have the opposite effect on price transmission...|$|R

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, the Hamburg steak became popular on the menus of many {{restaurants}} in the port of New York. This kind of fillet was beef minced by hand, lightly salted and often smoked, and usually served raw in a dish along with onions and bread crumbs. The oldest document that refers to the Hamburg steak is a Delmonico's Restaurant menu from 1873 which offered customers an 11-cent plate of Hamburg steak that had been developed by American chef Charles Ranhofer (1836–1899). This price was high for the time, twice {{the price of a}} simple <b>fillet</b> of beef <b>steak.</b> However, {{by the end of the}} century the Hamburg steak was gaining popularity because of its ease of preparation decreasing cost. This is evident from its detailed description in some of the most popular cookbooks of the day. Documents show that this preparation style was used by 1887 in some U.S. restaurants and was also used for feeding patients in hospitals; the Hamburg steak was served raw or lightly cooked and was accompanied by a raw egg.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{province}} of Tucumán, Argentina, it enjoys great popularity. This sandwich is called [...] "sánguche de milanesa" [...] or [...] "milanga" [...] in Tucumán, and is sold in [...] "sangucherías" [...] and food carts. Sangucherías are a type of fast food restaurant that sells milanesa sandwiches, along {{with other types of}} sandwich such as [...] "lomito"(which is almost identical to the Milanesa sandwich, but replaces the milanesa with a thin rib <b>steak</b> <b>fillet,</b> hence the name [...] "lomito", which is the name of that cut in Spanish). Sangucherías do not usually form fast food chains, although there are a few exceptions. They are mostly family owned. The main difference between this variety of the sandwich and others prepared in the country is that it is always eaten warm. The sandwich is prepared in the presence of its consumer, who can oversee its preparation. The lettuce is always shredded in small bits, and the addition of onions(cooked or raw, soaked in vinegar) and ají(hot chili pepper sauce) is usually encouraged. The bread used is soft but usually toasted for a few seconds before being eaten, making it a bit crunchy in the outside. The milanesas are always fried, and might be accompanied with ham, cheese and fried eggs for a higher price.|$|R
40|$|Research PaperThe {{introduction}} of new frozen processed products such as Marine Stewardship Council certified New Zealand hoki into the UK market is providing consumers with options away from the standard choices of cod and haddock. Resource managers all {{have a stake in}} successful product endeavors since new exotic seafood choices could reduce the pressure on stocks currently being overfished. In light of the overwhelming number of products available for retail purchase, it is important that producers key in on the attributes which most appeal to consumers. An objective of the analysis is to determine the relative value of different attributes, such as species and MSC label, on retail prices for frozen processed whitefish in the UK market. A hedonic framework is employed to analyze the retail market using scanner data purchased from IRI, Inc. The data were collected weekly from January 2002 to February 2005. Approximately 130 distinct products are evaluated on the basis of five major attribute groupings, including species, brand (including private label and brands such as Bird's Eye), coating, cut (<b>steaks,</b> <b>fillets,</b> fishcakes, fingers, etc), and package size, encompassing a total of 29 categories. Additionally, the data is disaggregated into two geographical regions within the UK which enables the analysis to treat the areas as distinctly different markets and examine any regional disparities. In addition, we are able to distinguish between some MSC-labeled hoki and non-MSC labeled hoki to determine if there is a premium paid for MSC products...|$|R
40|$|Resumo: A conservação da polpa de corvina (Micropogon furníeri) e castanha (Umbrina canosai), em temperatura de - 30 °C, por 150 dias, e os efeitos da adição de trípolifosfato de sódio, cloreto de sódio e acido ascórbico foram estudados através da determinação de quatro testes: bases voláteis totais, valor "TBA", capacidade de retenção de água e "drip". As amostras tratadas com 0, 1 % de acido ascórbico apresentaram menor oxidação, enquanto que as adicionadas de cloreto de sódio a 1 % mostraram maior capacidade de retenção de água e menor perda de água na descongelação. O teor de bases voláteis totais aumentou de forma idêntica para todas as amostras. Foram preparados hambúrgueres da mesma polpa, misturadas com proteína de soja texturizada a 3 / 3 e 4, 2 % em base seca, e com carne bovina moída na relação 1 : 1. Os hambúrgueres preparados com proteína de soja texturizada e polpa de pescado sem carne bovina apresentaram melhores resultados na avaliação sensorial feita por sete degustadores. Concluímos que a polpa de pescado pode ser utilizada tanto como um substituto de parte da carne bovina em produtos como hambúrgueres tradicionais, como na elaboração de um produto só de pescado. A soja texturizada substitui os outros ingredientes normalmente usados para ligar as partículas de carne e manter o produto coeso, quando cozido, bem como apresenta a vantagem de aportar razoável enriquecimento protéico ao produto finalAbstract: The under {{utilization}} of fish catches {{and the increased}} demand for fish as food has lead us to the scarcity of the oceans. The machine separation of flesh from the bones and skin offers {{a new source of}} a good r aw material for new products, that have a good potential for the introduction of fish of species of low or medium commercial value, in institutional food markets. Two species of fish of this type, Corvina (Micropogon furníeri) and castanha(Umbrina canosai) represent about 30 % of the total catch landed in Rio Grande, RS. The flesh of these non very fatty fish is white with red spots. These are processed as frozen <b>fillets,</b> frozen <b>steaks,</b> and as eviscerated and salted fish. The conservation of a fish paste of corvina and castanha, with and without additives, such as 1 % sodium chloride, 0, 1 % sodium tripolyphosphate, and 0, 1 % ascorbic acid were studied during 150 days of storage at - 30 °C. The samples were analyzed by four tests: total volatile basis, TBA test, water holding capacity, and drip. The first show a uniform deterioration of samples. The TBA test indicates that the 0, 1 % ascorbic acid retard the oxidation of the meat. The samples treated with 1 % sodium chloride denoted the best water holding capacity and less drip, than the samples treated with sodium tripolyphosphatet. The fish paste with texturized soy protein added and with and without beef in teh relation fish-beef (1 : 1) was used to prepare a hamburger. The composition of the hamburgers was as follows; fish and beef - 66 and 60 %; texturized soy protein - 3, 3 and 4, 2 %(dry basis); pork fat - 22, 5 %; salt - 1, 5 %. The hamburger was tested by a 7 member panel trained to prove a tradicional beef hamburbuer. The fish made hamburger rated better that those prepared with fish and beef, it seems that fish paste {{can be used as a}} substitute of part of beef in tradicional hamburger or as the unique animal protein source in a new product, apparently with the same acceptability by the consumer...|$|R
