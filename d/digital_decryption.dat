Prior to the close {{down of the}} analogue channels, the package consisted of Disney Channel and four C More Entertainment TV channels. When the analogue transmitters were closed down, a new multiplex launched bringing Kino TV, Nickelodeon, Discovery Channel and MTV to the package. Kino TV is exclusive was exclusive to Canal Digital, while the others were also sold by its competitor, PlusTV. The erotic channel Canal 69 is added on 1 October 2007.|$|R

The applet can be used for ISO 7816 [1] compliant <b>digital</b> signatures, <b>decryption</b> and authentication. This thesis assesses the correctness of the on-card implementation by means of model based testing. The host application is not considered in this thesis. This thesis explains how the applet was modelled, and how model based testing was used to validate that the Javacardsign applet is correct and secure. The methodology used in this thesis could be used to test other smart cards that are a component of a Public Key Infrastructure. 3...|$|R

Previously that conversion had required expensive equipment to retain all six channels of audio rather than having it downmixed to stereo. In the <b>digital</b> method, the <b>decryption</b> is done by a commercial software player which has been patched to allow access to the unprotected audio.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{networked}} video applications, {{to protect}} the multimedia content after <b>decryption,</b> <b>digital</b> fingerprinting {{can be used to}} trace the illegal redistribution of multimedia by uniquely labelling each distributed copy. It is crucial to efficiently distribute the uniquely fingerprinted copies without disclosing the secrecy of the embedded fingerprints. This paper investigates the bandwidth efficient transmission of fingerprinted video. To reduce the communication cost, we explore the special structure of the fingerprint design and propose a joint fingerprint design and distribution scheme, where some fingerprinted coefficients that are shared by a subgroup of users are securely multicasted to them. From the simulations, the proposed scheme reduces the bandwidth requirement by 61 % to 87 %, depending on the number of users and the characteristics of video sequences. I...|$|R
40|$|Security is an {{essential}} part of network communication. The advances in cryptography have provided solutions to many of the network security requirements. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is the foundation of the cryptography applications. The main objective of this research is to design a model to simulate a reliable, scalable, manageable, and high-performance public key infrastructure. We build a model to simulate the NASA public key infrastructure by using SimProcess and MatLab Software. The simulation is from top level all the way down to the computation needed for encryption, <b>decryption,</b> <b>digital</b> signature, and secure web server. The application of secure web server could be utilized in wireless communications. The results of the simulation are analyzed and confirmed by using queueing theory...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This paper makes simple {{observation}} {{on security}} of the net-worked cryptographic device resilient to capture that was developed to protect user’s private keys by software-only techniques. That scheme provided valuable features for secure generation of <b>digital</b> signatures or <b>decryption</b> of messages in a way of retaining a password-protected pri-vate key in a user-controlled device. The key idea was to exploit network connectivity rather than tamper-resistance of the device for securing the private key in software. However, we have found a few weak points that are not negligible in some sense. It was difficult to protect the private key in software even with provable security. So, we will describe such dif-ficulties and provide possible solutions in this paper. Also the networked cryptographic devices will be augmented in that fashion. ...|$|R

While technological advances have dramatically decreased the cost of building and launching these satellites, the cost and complexity of accessing their data for commercial use are still prohibitively high. This paper describes Reconfigurable Gateway Systems which provide, to a broad spectrum of existing and new data users, affordable telemetry data acquisition, processing and distribution for real-time remotely sensed data at rates up to 300 Mbps. These Gateway Systems are based upon reconfigurable computing, multiprocessing, and process automation technologies to meet a broad range of satellite communications and data processing applications.

40|$|Abstract — Data {{security}} and encryption {{are now a}} days playing major role in Information Technology [IT] sector. Security problem generated creates exertion to the firm. They are several Digital Signature Algorithms which are useful in providing security for the issues generated. Elgamal Digital Signature [EDS] Algorithm which is used in wide applications had proved its efficiency in safe guarding the data. However due to different choppers the data is not firmly reaching the safe side. The previous methods proposed using this EDS Algorithm had given appropriate measures using several methods in protecting the data. But there are some flaws which made EDS Algorithm efficiency poor. In this paper, we are proposing an advanced EDS Algorithm with keys generated through statistical approach which consists of combination of random numbers and prime numbers blend with an Exclusive OR (⊕) operation to enhance the complexity for the key to be generated. We know that EDS Algorithm also ensures {{security and}} time complexity of improved signature. This proposed method can give us an authentication with a <b>Digital</b> Signature for <b>decryption</b> of the data at the receiver side very sanctuary...|$|R

Using TGPay, PTGPA performs analyses of payment protocols under two scenarios in full automation. An Alpha-Scenario is one in which a candidate protocol runs in a perfect environment without attacks from any intruders. The candidate protocol is correct if and only if all pre-conditions and post-conditions are met. PTGPA models actions and knowledge sets of intruders in a second, modified protocol that represents an attack scenario. This second protocol, called a Beta-Scenario, is obtained mechanically from the original candidate protocol, by applying a set of elementary capabilities from a Dolev-Yao intruder model. This thesis includes a number of case studies to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the proposed framework. Automated analyses of real-world bank card payment protocols as well as newly proposed contactless mobile payment protocols are presented. Security flaws are identified in some of the protocols; their causes and implications are addressed. by Enyang Huang. Thesis (Ph.
