40|$|Appendix G (10 CFR 50 App. G) prescribes the pressure-temperature (P-T) {{limits for}} light water power {{reactors}} by incorporating American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) Boiler & Pressure Vessel Code, Section XI, Appendix G (ASME App. G) by reference. The P-T limits in ASME App. G {{are based on}} the fracture toughness of the vessel limiting material accounting for irradiation effects. The fracture toughness of the limiting material is determined based on the plane strain fracture toughness, KIc, indexed to the material reference temperature, RTNDT. Prior to the 2000 Addenda of ASME App. G, fracture toughness was based on the arrest fracture toughness, KIa, but the approval of Code Case N- 640 [1] in 1998 changed the fracture toughness basis to KIc. In addition to the P-T limits determined by ASME App. G, 10 CFR 50 App. G sets additional minimum temperature requirements that limit the operating pressure based on other factors such as the minimum unirradiated reference temperature, RTNDT(u), of the material in the closure <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> region. This paper presents an analysis of the closure <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> region minimum temperature requirements based on both KIa and KIc. Recommendations for potential alternative minimum temperature requirements are made for normal operation and hydrostatic test conditions...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIntroductionImpingement is {{a factor}} of failure in total hip {{replacement}} (THR), causing instability and early wear. Its true frequency is not known; cup-retrieval series reported rates varying from 27 to 84 %. HypothesisThe hypothesis was that a large continuous series of THR cup removals would help determine the frequency of component impingement. ObjectivesThe hypothesis was tested on a continuous retrospective series of cups removed in a single center, with a secondary objective of identifying risk factors. Materiel and methodsMacroscopic examination looked for component impingement signs in 416  cups retrieved by a single operator between 1989 and 2004. Risk factors were investigated by uni- and multivariate analyses in the 311  cases for which there were complete demographic data. In these 311  cases, removal was for aseptic loosening (131  cases), infection (43  cases), instability (56  cases), osteolysis (28  cases) or unexplained pain (48  cases); impingement was explicitly implicated in only five cases (1. 6 %), always with hard-on-hard bearing components. ResultsImpingement was found in 214 of the 416  cups (51. 4 %) and was severe (notch> 1 mm) in 130 (31. 3 %). In the subpopulation of 311  cups, impingement was found in 184  cases (59. 2 %) and was severe in 109 (35 %). Neither duration of implant use nor cup diameter or frontal orientation emerged as risk factors. On univariate analysis, impingement was more frequently associated with revision for instability, young patient age at THR, global hip range of motion > 200 ° or use of an extended femoral <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> (or of an elevated antidislocation rim liner), and was more severe in case of head/neck ratio< 2. On multivariate analysis, only use of an extended <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> (RR 3. 2) and revision for instability (RR 4. 2) remained as independent risk factors for impingement. DiscussionComponent impingement is frequently observed in cups after removal, but is rarely found as a direct indication for revision, except in case of hard-on-hard friction couples (polyethylene being the most impingement-tolerant material). Systematic use of extended head flanges and elevated antidislocation rims {{is not to be}} recommended, especially in case of excessive ROM. A good head/neck ratio should be sought, notably by increasing the head diameter in less impingement-tolerant hard-on-hard friction couples. Although not identified as a risk factor in the present study, implant orientation should be checked; computer-assisted surgery can be useful in this regard, for adaptation to the patient's individual range-of-motion cone.

40|$|The {{overpressure}} {{fragility of}} a Mark I {{boiling water reactor}} drywell was performed by detailed finite element (FE) analysis. The drywell overpressure capacity {{is controlled by the}} onset of leakage in the bolted <b>head</b> <b>flange</b> connection once separation exceeds the capacity of the silicone rubber O-ring seals. The FE analysis was conducted at 6 discrete accident temperatures, ranging from 150 to 425 °C. The overpressure evaluation used an axisymmetric model of the drywell head region for computational efficiency, and verified it by comparing to results from one FE model which used 3 D solid elements. The mechanical properties of the steel materials were defined as temperature-dependent linear-elastic. The median overpressure capacity at each temperature was determined using a 2 -step thermal-stress analysis procedure. First, a steady-state heat transfer analysis was conducted to map out the temperature distribution in the drywell wall, which is exposed to the accident temperature on the inside and ambient temperature on the outside. Second, a quasi-static multi-step stress analysis was performed. The vertical differential movement between the flange surfaces was monitored and compared to the O-ring rebound capacity to define the pressure at the onset of leakage. After leakage occurred, the relationship between leakage area and increased pressure was recorded. The evaluation predicted the median overpressure capacity and the lognormal standard deviation for uncertainty in O-ring rebound capacities, bolt preload, and model sophistication, in addition to the median pressure-leak area relationship...|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea behind}} solid {{material}} {{is to use}} metals which cannot be punched out of sheets but are still cheap to produce. These gaskets generally have a much higher level of quality control than sheet gaskets and generally can withstand much higher temperatures and pressures. The key downside is that a solid metal must be greatly compressed {{in order to become}} flush with the <b>flange</b> <b>head</b> and prevent leakage. The material choice is more difficult; because metals are primarily used, process contamination and oxidation are risks. An additional downside is that the metal used must be softer than the flange [...] - [...] {{in order to ensure that}} the flange does not warp and thereby prevent sealing with future gaskets.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} neutron {{irradiation}} on the steel reactor vessel for the modular high-temperature gas-cooled reactor (MHTGR) are being investigated, primarily because the operating temperatures are low [121 to 288 °C (250 - 550 °F) ] {{compared to those}} for commercial light-water reactors (LWRs) [~ 288 °C (550 °F) ]. The need for design data on the reference temperature (RTNDT) shift necessitated the irradiation at different temperatures of A 533 grade B class 1 plates, A 508 class 3 forging, and welds used for the vessel shell, vessel closure <b>head,</b> and vessel <b>flange.</b> This paper presents regular- and mini-tensile, Automated Ball Indentation (ABI) and Charpy V-notch (CVN) impact test results from five irradiation capsules of this program. The first four capsules were irradiated in the University of Buffalo Reactor (UBR) to an effective fast fluence of 1. 1 × 1018 neutrons/cm 2 [0. 7 × 1018 neutrons/cm 2 (> 1 MeV) ] at temperatures of 288, 204...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In the {{construction}} of composite bridge structures, various types of shear connectors are usually used to provide an efficient load transfer and the composite action {{of two or more}} different materials. In the previous work conducted by authors, a new type of the shear connector was introduced, which is the perforated shear connector with <b>flange</b> <b>heads</b> (T-shaped perforated shear connector), and the structural behavior of the shear connector was discussed {{based on the results of}} push-out tests. For the practical design of new shear connector, it is necessary to develop the equation for the prediction of the load carrying capacity of the shear connector. In this study, the existing design equations for the Perfobond shear connector were briefly analyzed and the equation for the prediction of the shear capacity of T-shaped perforated shear connector was suggested empirically. By comparing the results obtained by the suggested equation, the existing equations for the Perfobond shear connector, and the experiment, the applicability and effectiveness of the suggested equation was estimated...|$|R
40|$|If {{the contact}} between the wheel and rail occurs at the flange, {{a high degree of}} slip is inherent. This can result in {{excessive}} wear and the potential for rolling contact fatigue cracking. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the bogie and track characteristics that may lead to flange contact occuring. However, {{there is a shortage of}} experimental tools available to validate such models or to assist in vehicle and track condition monitoring. In this study, the feasibility of a new approach is investigated. The method is based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel. The concept is that the sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected back at the flange and picked up by the same sensor. If flange contact takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced. The amount by which this signal reduces indicates how much flange contact occurs. Test specimens were cut from sections of wheel and rail, and a 2 MHz ultrasonic contact transducer was bonded onto the wheel in a position best suited to detect the flange contact. The specimens were pressed to together in a bi-axial loading frame to generate differing degrees of <b>head</b> and <b>flange</b> contact. The reflected signal was monitored as the normal and lateral loads were varied. It proved possible not only to detect the onset of flanging, but also to record a signal that varied monotonically with both normal and lateral applied load. A map of reflected ultrasound against the applied loading is presented...|$|R
40|$|Wheel/rail {{contact is}} {{critical}} to the successful operation of a railway network. Contact occurs at the wheel tread/rail head and wheel flange/rail gauge corner. Contact conditions are more severe in the latter, which occurs mainly at curves. The contact is small and supports large loads; therefore, high contact stresses are generated. These, combined with the slip in the contact, are primarily responsible for driving the processes that lead to wheel and rail damage, whether by deformation, wear or a fatigue process. Multi-body dynamics software is useful for predicting the wheel/rail contact characteristics; however, {{there is a shortage of}} experimental tools available. In this study, the feasibility of an approach based on an ultrasonic sensor mounted on the wheel is investigated. The sensor emits an ultrasonic pulse which is designed to impinge on the wheel flange. If there is no contact the pulse is fully reflected back at the flange and picked up by the same sensor. If flange contact takes place, a proportion of the pulse amplitude will be transmitted into the rail. The signal reflected back to the sensor is therefore reduced. The amount by which this signal reduces indicates how much flange contact has occurred. This work had two aspects. First, a standard ultrasonic ray-tracing software package was used to establish what it is possible to measure with sensors mounted in the wheel and to determine the best location and orientation. The second aspect was an experimental study to determine whether such measurements are feasible. Test specimens were cut from sections of wheel and rail, and a 2 [*]MHz ultrasonic contact transducer was bonded onto the wheel in a position best suited to detect the flange contact. The specimens were pressed together in a bi-axial loading frame to generate differing degrees of rail <b>head</b> and <b>flange</b> contact. The reflected signal was monitored as the normal and lateral loads were varied. It proved possible not only to detect the onset of flanging, but also to record a signal that varied monotonically with both normal and lateral applied load. A map of reflected ultrasound against the applied loading is presented. The technology, while not currently suitable for full field implementation could be very useful in laboratory studies on, for example, a full-scale wheel/rail rig...|$|R
