40|$|Understanding the {{evolution}} of the mid-Cenozoic Melanesian arc is critical for our knowledge of the regional tectonic development of the Australian-Pacific plate margin, yet there have been no recent studies to constrain the nature and timing of magmatic activity in this arc segment. In particular, there are currently no robust absolute age constraints at the plate margin related to either the initiation or cessation of subduction and arc magmatism. We present the first combined U–Pb zircon geochronology and geochemical investigation into {{the evolution}} of the Melanesian arc utilizing a comprehensive sample suite from the Simuku Igneous Complex of West New Britain, Papua New Guinea. Development of the embryonic island arc from at least 40 Ma and progressive arc growth was punctuated by <b>distant</b> <b>collision</b> of the Ontong Java Plateau and subduction cessation from 26 Ma.

The contemporaneous emplacement of both 'normal' arc volcanics and adakite-like porphyry intrusives may provide avenues for future research into the origin of diverse styles of arc volcanism. Not only is this one of few studies into the geology of the Melanesian arc, it is also among the first to address the distant tectono-magmatic effects ofmajor arc/forearc collision events and subduction cessation on magmatic arcs, and also offers insight into the tectonic context of porphyry formation in island arc settings...|$|E

The dynamics is described theoretically by Time-Dependent Density-Functional Theory (TDDFT) {{at the level of}} Local Density Approximation (LDA) augmented by a self interaction correction term and a quantum collision term in Relaxation-Time Approximation (RTA). We evaluate the separate contributions to the total excitation energy, namely energy exported by electron emission, potential energy due to changing charge state, intrinsic kinetic and potential energy, and collective flow energy. The balance of these energies is studied as function of the laser parameters (frequency, intensity, pulse length) and as function of system size and charge.

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{describe}} {{an extension of}} the convolution approximation for the ionization probability and energy loss straggling {{as a function of the}} impact parameter for swift ions. Analytical formulas for these quantities are derived and compared to full first order Born calculations. The physical inputs of the model are the electron density and oscillators strengths of the target as well as the screening function of the projectile in the case of dressed ions. A very good agreement is obtained for all impact parameters. In addition, we propose a general schema to add contributions from <b>distant</b> and close <b>collisions.</b> In this way physical processes arising from large and small impact parameters can be easily included into a single expression valid for all impact parameters. This model is then used to investigate the projectile charge q dependence of ionization, stopping and straggling cross section...|$|R
