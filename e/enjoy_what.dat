The institution prevails in order that others might improve their heads, hearts, and hands." [...] The university's vice president recalled her legacy: [...] "During Mrs. Bethune's time, this was the only place in the city of Daytona Beach where Whites and Blacks could sit in the same room and <b>enjoy</b> <b>what</b> she called 'gems from students'—their recitations and songs. This is a person who was able to bring Black people and White together." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{became a}} bestseller, {{and in its}} first four months on the market, it sold 173,000 copies, making Bleed American Jimmy Eat World's most {{successful}} album. Lind said that these sales were [...] "definitely {{a big deal to}} the band because it shows how the fanbase is growing.

[...] The album was certified gold in the United States in March 2002, and it had reached platinum status by August. It peaked at number 54 on the Billboard 200 on August 11, 2001. The album produced four singles: [...] "Bleed American", [...] "The Middle", [...] "Sweetness", and [...] "A Praise Chorus". The album's most successful single was [...] "The Middle".

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of HitFix {{praised the}} episode structure, writing [...] "The quick {{transitions}} and constant back-and-forth movement among subplots generated more energy that, {{when combined with}} several characters we either didn't know before or hadn't {{seen in a long}} time, made [...] "The Broken Man" [...] feel livelier." [...] Similarly, Ed Power of The Daily Telegraph also praised the episode, noting, [...] "Once again there was a sense Game of Thrones was steeling itself for battles - and expensive set-pieces - chugging down the track. A storm is brewing - for now, we were invited to <b>enjoy</b> <b>what</b> remains of the calm." [...] Jen Chaney of Vulture also felt the episode was more of a set up episode for storylines to be resolved in the close of the season, writing [...] "Although two bombs get dropped in this week's episode of Game of Thrones, it's an hour focused on putting the narrative chess pieces into place. [...] "The Broken Man" [...] doesn't finish off any of its major moves. Those bold turns are yet to come." ...|$|E
500|$|In early 2010, it was {{announced}} that three new characters; Doug Harris (Mahesh Jadu), Michael Williams (Sandy Winton) and Natasha Williams were to join Neighbours in the following months. Novakovic, a performing arts college graduate, was cast in the role of Natasha. The actress had been studying architecture at university, before she chose to move into acting. Shortly after her casting {{was announced}}, Novakovic revealed that the role of Natasha was her first acting job and that while she would always be interested in architecture, she really wanted to enjoy the experience on Neighbours. Novakovic moved from Sydney to Melbourne, where Neighbours is filmed, for the role. She is three years older than the character she portrays. In 2011, Novakovic revealed she is still happy with the career choice she made, stating [...] "I <b>enjoy</b> <b>what</b> I'm doing now a lot more than studying, because this is where I want to be.

500|$|It {{was widely}} {{expected}} that Southern Rhodesia {{would eventually be}} incorporated into the Union of South Africa as its fifth province. It was generally considered part of South Africa geographically and in colonial terms, part of the British expansion into the region that had begun with the 1820 Settlers. Representatives from Rhodesia had participated in the South African National Convention of 1908 and section 150 of the South Africa Act 1909 made specific provision for the accession of BSAC territories. Coghlan had represented the interests of the Rhodesian people at the Convention, although his contribution was insignificant. The presence of the Rhodesian delegation had been supported - and even secured - by Louis Botha, who was keen to win the trust of the settlers. In November 1909, at a banquet for Lord Selborne, the departing High Commissioner in Cape Town, Coghlan spoke of the BSAC and the people of Southern Rhodesia working together towards entering the Union, though some settlers wished to <b>enjoy</b> <b>what</b> he called [...] "an artificial stage of responsible government" [...] first. Indeed, the order in council of 1898 had provided Southern Rhodesia with a constitution that resembled that of a Crown Colony with responsible government and the South Africa Act made no changes to the territory's administrative framework.|$|E

Separate videos were recorded for each set of lyrics.|$|E

They had proposed a system of [...] "triage" [...] that would end food aid to [...] "hopeless" [...] countries such as India and Egypt. In Population Bomb, Ehrlich suggests that [...] "there is no rational choice except to adopt some form of the Paddocks' strategy as far as food distribution is concerned." [...] Had this strategy been implemented for countries such as India and Egypt, which were reliant on food aid at that time, they would almost certainly have suffered famines. Instead, both Egypt and India have greatly increased their food production and now feed much larger populations without reliance on food aid.|$|E
