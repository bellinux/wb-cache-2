Following the visit, she sailed to Manila. When she arrived in February 1877, an {{accident}} occurred as the crew were preparing a gun salute for her entrance to the harbour. As the crewman loaded the charge into one of the guns, it detonated, throwing him from the ship and killing him. The crewman was subsequently buried in the city.

Sam tells Lois the only reason he has been lenient with her is because she is his daughter, while he does love her the planet will always come first over his family and threatens to make her disappear forever if she continues. Lois returns to the Daily Planet under cover of night and explains all to Perry. She points out the whole paper is at risk and everyone connected to it if her exposé runs.

500|$|In season eight, Mary Alice {{appears in}} several flashbacks {{and as a}} ghost.

500|$|In 1955, O'Hara {{made her}} fourth picture with Ford, The Long Gray Line, which she {{considered}} being [...] "by {{far the most}} difficult" [...] due to declining relations with John Ford. John Wayne had originally intended co-starring, but due to a conflicting schedule O'Hara recommended Tyrone Power in replacement. Malone notes that the Irish accents by O'Hara and Power are overdone, {{and that there is}} little trace of a Donegal accent in it. The film production marked the lowest point of O'Hara's relationship with Ford, and each day he would <b>greet</b> <b>her</b> with [...] "Well, did Herself have a good shit this morning?". He would ask the crew if she was in a good mood, and if that was the case, he would say [...] "then we're going to have a horrible day" [...] and vice versa. He would provoke her by telling her to [...] "move her fat Irish ass". Their relationship deteriorated further when O'Hara reportedly saw him kissing an actor on set, and Ford knew that she thought he was a closeted homosexual. In The Magnificent Matador, O'Hara played a spoiled, wealthy American who {{falls in love with a}} brooding, tormented, about-to-retire matador (Anthony Quinn) in Mexico. Ava Gardner, who was dating a bullfighter in real life, Luis Miguel Dominguín, and Lana Turner were considered for O'Hara's part of Karen Harrison. The film was panned by the critics. One of her best-known roles came later year, playing Lady Godiva in Lady Godiva of Coventry. Contrary to what Universal claimed to the press, O'Hara was not nude in the film, wearing a [...] "full-length body leotard and underwear that was concealed by my long tresses".|$|E

[...] More than ten thousand {{people showed up}} to <b>greet</b> <b>her</b> upon her arrival, and at a reception the poet Louis-Honoré Fréchette read a poem that he had written in her honour. Her first operatic performance in Canada came on 13 February 1883 in Toronto, at the Grand Opera House where she performed in Lucia di Lammermoor. On 15 July 1884 in London she sang the role of Brunehild in Ernest Reyer's opera Sigurd {{and the role of}} Juliette in Gounod's Roméo et Juliette in the same season.|$|E

2500|$|The Soviet Union {{was one of}} {{the first}} nations to extend {{diplomatic}} recognition to the newly created state of Israel in 1948. However, when the Israeli ambassador Golda Meir arrived in the USSR, Stalin was angered by the Jewish crowds who arrayed to <b>greet</b> <b>her.</b> He was further angered by Israel's growing alliance with the U.S. After Stalin fell out with Israel, he launched an anti-Jewish campaign within the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. In November 1948, he abolished the JAC, and show trials took place for some of its members.

2500|$|In 1797, {{she insisted}} on {{skipping}} the protocol at the reception of her daughter-in-law, Frederica of Baden. The etiquette demanded that as Queen Dowager, she should not <b>greet</b> <b>her</b> daughter-in-law at the stair of the royal palace {{with the rest of}} the royal family, but wait for her in her own salon, but she refused: [...] "I know myself how I suffered, when I arrived to Sweden, and how painfully I reacted to the cold reception I was given by Queen Louisa Ulrika. As for my daughter-in-law, I have decided to spare her from having to experience such bitter emotions!" [...] During the reign of her son, she seldom showed herself at court except on Sundays and at court presentations, and preferred to stay at her estate. She regularly met her son and his family on family visits, but she did not participate in court life.|$|E
