5000|$|A <b>jack</b> <b>post</b> (telepost, {{adjustable}} steel column) is a steel post used in {{the construction}} trades for temporary support of ceilings, walls and trenches (shoring). The term [...] "jack post" [...] {{is one of many}} describing the same system, other names include any assortment of [...] "adjustable", [...] "steel", [...] "jack" [...] and [...] "shoring" [...] with [...] "post", [...] "column" [...] and [...] "prop", depending on their precise construction - the [...] "jack" [...] refers to examples with a jack screw to adjust the precise length of the post. They are also known by any number of trade names, notably [...] "lally column" [...] and [...] "Acrow prop". <b>Jack</b> <b>posts</b> are widely standardized.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jack</b> <b>posts</b> are {{telescopic}} {{tubular steel}} props {{consisting of two}} primary parts, {{the main part of}} the <b>post,</b> and the <b>jack</b> screw or other adjustable fitting on the end. Both ends are normally fitted with flat metal plates on the end, providing additional support area. Most <b>jack</b> <b>posts</b> are split in two near the middle, with the upper end carrying the jack designed to slide within the lower portion. Gross adjustment for length is first made by pulling a pin and sliding the two sections within each other until they almost fill the gap, inserting the pin to lock them, then using the screw to close any remaining gap. Other designs used two threaded pipes instead of sliding sections, clamping sections, or other similar concepts to lock the system at a specific length.|$|R

50|$|A house jack, {{also called}} a screw jack, is a {{mechanical}} device primarily used to lift buildings from their foundations for repairs or relocation. A series of jacks is used and then wood cribbing temporarily supports the structure. This process is repeated until the desired height is reached. The house jack {{can be used}} for jacking carrying beams that have settled or for installing new structural beams. On the top of the jack is a cast iron circular pad that the <b>jacking</b> <b>post</b> rests on. This pad moves independently of the house jack so that it does not turn as the acme-threaded rod is turned with a metal rod. This piece tilts very slightly, but not enough to render the post dangerously out of plumb.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jack</b> <b>posts</b> {{are mostly}} used for shoring: {{temporary}} supports during building repair or alteration work, rather than scaffolding: access platforms for workers. A typical use {{is to support}} an existing horizontal beam while its original masonry supports are removed or repaired. When masonry itself is to be supported, holes are first knocked through the brickwork and a strong 'needle' or 'strongboy' is placed through the hole. A pair of props are then used, one under each end. Existing windows or doorways may also be supported directly, or via needles. As the plates {{on the end of}} the posts are typically small, they offer little sideways support. If there is any sideways force, props should be strutted or 'laced' with scaffolding poles.|$|R

50|$|Despite his {{successful}} {{transition from a}} first baseman slugger to a young phenom pitcher, the New York baseball Giants allowed the Chicago White Sox to purchase Harshman's contract. Jack made his White Sox debut against the Cleveland Indians on April 14, 1954. He started the game, but only lasted 3 innings after being tagged for 4 earned runs on 8 hits. After another poor 2 innings start on April 19, Harshman was demoted to the bullpen. He continued to struggle until he was given another start on June 6. He responded by throwing a 7-hit shutout against the Washington Senators. On July 25, he struck out 16 Red Sox hitters, including the great Ted Williams in a complete game for a 5-2 win. At {{the time it was}} the most strikeouts in the long history of Fenway Park. The record would stand for 32 years until a young flamethrower named Roger Clemens fanned a Major League best 20 batters. After that, Jack settled down and had a largely successful season overall, including an exceptional performance for the month of August. <b>Jack</b> <b>posted</b> a 6-0 record with 47 strikeouts and a microscopic 0.77 ERA. His first full season posted some impressive numbers: A 14-8 win-loss record, a 2.95 ERA, 4 complete game shut-outs, and 134 strikeouts, which was good enough for 5th in the American League.|$|R
