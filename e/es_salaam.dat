5|$|In mid-October 1905, Seeadler sent {{a landing}} party ashore at Samanga {{to protect the}} coastal {{telegraph}} line there. By mid-December, she had returned to Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> before proceeding to Kilwa on 17 January 1906. The cruiser was back in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> on 24 January. Another overhaul at Cape Town followed from 10 February to 16 March. By this time, the situation in East Africa had calmed, and the light cruiser , which had also been sent to suppress the Maji-Maji uprising, {{was sent back to}} Germany. Seeadler nevertheless remained in the region, and was formally assigned to the East Africa Station in early 1907. In October 1907, then-Korvettenkapitän (Lieutenant Commander) Hugo Meurer served as the ship's commanding officer. He would hold the position until June 1909.|$|E
5|$|On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda {{teams in}} Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> Tanzania, {{attacked}} the cities' U.S. embassies simultaneously with truck bombs. In Nairobi, the explosion collapsed the nearby Ufundi Building and destroyed the embassy, killing 213 people, including 12 Americans; another 4,000 people were wounded. In Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> the bomber {{was unable to}} {{get close enough to}} the embassy to demolish it, but the blast killed 11 Africans and wounded 85. Bin Laden justified the high-casualty attacks, the largest against the U.S. since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombings, by claiming they were in retaliation for the deployment of U.S. troops in Somalia; he also alleged the embassies had devised the Rwandan Genocide and a supposed plan to partition Sudan.|$|E
5|$|A year later, in 1963, FRELIMO set up {{headquarters}} in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> Tanzania, {{under the leadership}} of sociologist Eduardo Mondlane, and began to call for independence from Portugal.After two years of organisation and failing political manoeuvres in an attempt to seek a peaceful independence, Mondlane began in 1964 a campaign of guerrilla warfare in an attempt to achieve independence for Mozambique.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} in Europe {{rose in the}} aftermath of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria, Looff decided to abandon the normal peacetime training schedule and returned to Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> on 24 July to replenish his coal and other stores. He also made efforts to organize a coast watcher network to report enemy ships and to protect German shipping in the area. On 27 July, Looff received a message from the Admiralstab (Admiralty Staff) informing him of the worsening political situation in Europe. Concurrently, the cruisers of the British Cape Squadron, , , and , arrived with the intention of bottling up Königsberg at the colony's capital Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> Looff got his ship ready to sail and left port on the afternoon of 31 July 1914, with the three slower British ships shadowing him. Looff used a rain squall and his ship's superior speed to break contact with his British pursuers the following day. Königsberg steamed off Aden until 5 August, when word of the outbreak of hostilities between Britain and Germany belatedly reached the ship.|$|E
5|$|Matlock's next {{assignment}} was as Deputy Chief of Mission {{in the capital}} of Tanzania, Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> Even in Africa, knowledge of Soviet Affairs proved useful. With Leonid Brezhnev in power, Soviet foreign policy as of 1968 was dictated by the Brezhnev Doctrine, which held that, once a country became Communist, it was never to leave the Soviet sphere of influence.|$|E
5|$|He {{joined the}} Foreign Service in 1956, {{and served in}} Vienna, Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Moscow, Accra, Zanzibar, and Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> He was Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department (1971–74), Diplomat in Residence at Vanderbilt University (1978–79), and Deputy Director of the Foreign Service Institute (1979–80). He served as U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia (1981–83) and as Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and Senior Director for European and Soviet Affairs on the National Security Council Staff (1983–86).|$|E
5|$|On February 3, 1969, Eduardo Mondlane {{was killed}} by {{explosives}} smuggled into his locale. Many sources state that, {{in an attempt to}} rectify the situation in Mozambique, the Portuguese secret police assassinated Mondlane by sending a parcel to his office in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> Inside the parcel was a book containing an explosive device, which detonated upon opening. Other sources state that Eduardo was killed when an explosive device detonated underneath his chair at the FRELIMO headquarters, and that the faction responsible was never identified.|$|E
5|$|The airline was {{wholly owned}} by the Government of Kenya until , and it was privatised in 1996, {{becoming}} the first African flag carrier to successfully do so. Kenya Airways is currently a public-private partnership. The largest shareholder is the Government of Kenya (29.8.%), followed by KLM, which has a 26.73% stake in the company. The rest of the shares are held by private owners; shares are traded on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, the Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> Stock Exchange, and the Uganda Securities Exchange.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, John Ingle, {{the former}} captain of Pegasus, was tasked with {{clearing}} wrecks from the harbor in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> At that time, {{he bought the}} salvage rights to Königsberg {{for the price of}} £200; he sent divers to extract non-ferrous scrap metal from the wreck and in turn sold the rights. Salvage work continued into the 1930s, and by the 1940s the hull had rolled over to her starboard side. As late as 1965, salvage work continued, but in 1966 the wreck collapsed and finally sank into the riverbed. Three of the ship's 10.5cm guns are preserved, one in Pretoria, South Africa, one in Jinja, Uganda, and one in Mombasa, along with a gun from Pegasus.|$|E
5|$|In 1945 Paton began {{construction}} of a wool factory at Darlington and a Rayon factory at Carrickfergus, both jobs were completed in 1951. In 1946 Paton {{was put in charge}} of an economic survey of Syria which required him to traverse the country by aircraft and car. The report, issued in 1947, recommended port, water infrastructure and irrigation improvements and the {{construction of}} a hydroelectric power station on the Euphrates River. Paton undertook a similar survey in Lebanon from 1947 to 1948. He was also involved in a report on the possibility of running a railroad from Northern Rhodesia to Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> Mtwara and Nyasaland.|$|E
5|$|The cruiser then {{returned}} to the Rufiji River so work could begin on overhauling her engines; the parts would need to be transported overland to the shipyard in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> where they could be rebuilt. While moored in the town of Salale, the ship was heavily camouflaged and defensive arrangements were erected. These included positioning soldiers and field guns to defend the approaches to the cruiser and establishing a network of coast watchers and telegraph lines to watch for hostile ships. An improvised minefield was also laid in the delta to keep the British ships from entering the river.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War I, Königsberg was ordered to attack British commerce around {{the entrance to the}} Red Sea. A lack of coal hampered Looff's efforts; the British prevented his collier Koenig from leaving Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> and purchased all the coal in Portuguese East Africa to deny it to Königsberg. Looff then radioed the German steamer Zieten to warn her against using the Suez Canal, where she would have been confiscated. Königsberg chased after the German freighter Goldenfels, whose officers mistook the ship for a British cruiser and refused to stop. Königsberg was forced to fire a warning shot across the bow of Goldenfels to force the ship to stop so that Looff could warn her captain of the state of war.|$|E
5|$|Later that day, {{the crew}} {{returned}} to haul down the ship's flag and gave three cheers for the Kaiser. The guns and other usable equipment were salvaged from the wreck starting the following day. The guns were converted into field artillery pieces and coastal guns; {{together with the}} ship's crew, {{they went on to}} see service in the East African land campaign under Lettow-Vorbeck. All ten guns were repaired in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> over the next two months; one was mounted on the converted ferry Götzen of the inland Lake Tanganyika fleet. The surviving sailors, organized as the Königsberg-Abteilung (Königsberg-Detachment), eventually surrendered on 26 November 1917 and were interned in British Egypt. In 1919, after the war, the men took part in a parade through the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin to celebrate their service and that of their ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{chestnut}} sparrow {{is found}} in East Africa in mostly lower country from Darfur through Kordofan, South Sudan, Somalia, Uganda, and Kenya to north-central Tanzania. Its range also extends northeast into the southwest and Great Rift Valley of Ethiopia. Like the golden sparrows, it is sometimes nomadic when not breeding. Vagrants have been recorded as far from their breeding range as Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> It is found mostly in dry savanna and in fields and villages, but unlike its relations the golden sparrows, it is sometimes found in swamps of papyrus (certain Cyperus spp.). Its population has not been quantified, but {{it appears to be}} common across a very large range and it is assessed by the IUCN Red List as Least Concern for global extinction.|$|E
5|$|The rise of African {{nationalism}} {{generated a}} white backlash in Southern Rhodesia, with the right-wing Rhodesian Front winning the December 1962 general election. The new government sought to preserve white minority rule by tightening security and establishing full {{independence from the}} United Kingdom. Mugabe met with colleagues at his house in Salisbury's Highbury district, where he argued that as political demonstrations were simply being banned, {{it was time to}} move towards armed resistance. Both he and others rejected Nkomo's proposal that they establish a government-in-exile in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam.</b> He and Hayfron skipped bail to attend a ZAPU meeting in the Tanganyikan city. There, the party leadership met Tanganyika's President, Julius Nyerere, who also dismissed the idea of a government-in-exile and urged ZAPU to organise their resistance to white minority rule within Southern Rhodesia itself.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Russo-Japanese War in February 1904, Seeadler was recalled to Tsingtau to be prepared for any possible hostilities involving Germany. During this period, Cormoran was replaced by Condor; the two cruisers were joined by Seeadlers old consort from East Africa, the survey vessel Möwe. In early 1905, Seeadler conducted goodwill visits to the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia), before returning to Tsingtau in April. On 28 June, with the Russo-Japanese War winding down following the decisive Japanese victory at the Battle of Tsushima, Seeadler was detached from the East Asia Squadron, permitting her return to the South Seas Station. While en route to her station area, Seeadler received an order to return to Africa during a stop at Ponape on 20 August. Her presence was necessary there to help put down a major uprising, the Maji Maji Rebellion, that had broken out in July. Seeadler ran aground twice, at Labuan and Singapore, on her way to East Africa, but neither incident resulted in damage to the ship. She arrived in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> on 1 October.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, British {{warships}} bombarded Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> {{and destroyed}} the German wireless station there. By this time, Königsbergs engines required a thorough overhaul, and Looff {{needed to find}} a secluded area where the work could be completed. He settled on the Rufiji Delta, which had recently been surveyed by the survey ship Möwe. On 3 September 1914 at high tide, Königsberg passed over {{the bar at the}} mouth of the Rufiji and slowly made her way up the river. Coast watchers were stationed {{at the mouth of the}} river and telegraph lines were run to ensure the Germans would not be surprised by British ships searching for them. Zimmer, who was sending small coastal steamers to resupply Königsberg, observed a British cruiser—Pegasus—patrolling the coast for two weeks. He deduced that the ship would likely have to coal at Zanzibar on Sundays, and so Looff decided to attack the ship in port before he began his overhaul. He considered the action justified, since Britain had rejected a German proposal to keep central Africa neutral according to the Congo Act of 1885.|$|E
5|$|Pułaski resumed her Indian Ocean service {{when she}} left Durban on 21 January 1945, headed for Kilindini. She visited Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> {{for the first time}} in April, and {{departed}} from her first visit to Madras on Victory in Europe Day, 8 May 1945. Headed to Akyab, Burma, she started the first of five India–Burma roundtrips through July. Over the next months, she shuttled between Rangoon, Calcutta (where she was docked on Victory over Japan Day), Chittagong, Madras, and Colombo, arriving at the latter port for the final time on 12 September. From Colombo she sailed into the Western Pacific for Singapore where she arrived for the first of several visits on 14 September, two days after the Japanese garrison there surrendered. Through the end of 1945, Pułaski continued sailing between Singapore and India, making additional stops at Port Swettenham, Chittagong, Sourabaya, and Batavia.|$|E
5|$|The {{cease-fire}} ended abruptly on 6 April 1994, when President Habyarimana's {{plane was}} shot down near Kigali Airport, killing both Habyarimana and the new President of Burundi, Cyprien Ntaryamira. The pair were returning home from a regional summit in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> at which the leaders of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania had urged Habyarimana to stop delaying {{the implementation of the}} Arusha accords. The attackers remain unknown. Prunier, in his book written shortly after the incident, concluded that it was most likely a coup d'État carried out by extreme Hutu members of Habyarimana's government. This theory was disputed in 2006 by French judge Jean-Louis Bruguière, and in 2008 by Spanish judge Fernando Andreu. Both alleged that Kagame and the RPF were responsible. At the end of 2010 the French government ordered a more thorough judicial inquiry, which employed ballistics experts. This report reaffirmed the initial theory that Hutu extremists assassinated Habyarimana.|$|E
5|$|To improve Britain's {{cultural}} influence abroad, Wheeler {{had been}} urging {{the establishment of}} a British Institute of History and Archaeology in East Africa, touring East Africa itself in August 1955. In 1956 the Academy requested £6,000 from the Treasury to fund this new institution, to which they eventually agreed in 1959. The Institute was initially established in Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> in 1961, although later relocated to Nairobi. Meanwhile, Wheeler had also been campaigning for {{the establishment of a}} British Institute of Persian Studies, a project which was supported by the British Embassy in Tehran; they hoped that it would rival the successful French Institute in the city. In 1960, the Treasury agreed, with the new institution being housed on the premises of the University of Tehran. He further campaigned {{for the establishment of a}} British Institute in Japan, although these ideas were scrapped amid the British financial crisis of 1967.|$|E
5|$|With her {{reconditioning}} complete, West Cheswald {{arrived in}} New York from Baltimore on 23 March. Although {{she may have}} been scheduled to begin her African service as early as 29 March, she sailed from New York on 11 April for the Cape Verde Islands, and from there, to Cape Town, where she arrived on 15 May. Beginning the next day, West Cheswald visited Port Elizabeth, East London, Durban, Mombasa, Tanga, and Zanzibar through 11 June. She returned to Tanga, then sailed from Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam</b> to Zanzibar and back on 23 and 24 June. She next made her way to Lourenço Marques, where she arrived on 3 July. From Lourenço Marques, she sailed back to Durban and Cape Town, before she began her transatlantic journey to Trinidad on 18 July. After calling at that Caribbean port, she returned to New York to complete her first circuit on 18 August.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October, Fort Stikine {{departed}} from Aden with Convoy AKD3. The unescorted convoy, consisting eighteen merchant vessels, arrived at Durban, South Africa on 29 October. She left the convoy at Beira, Mozambique, arriving on 26 October. Fort Stikine sailed on 11 November and joined Convoy DKA6. The unescorted convoy, consisting 20 merchant ships in total, had {{departed from}} Durban five days earlier {{and arrived at}} Aden on 28 November, but Fort Stikine had put into Dar <b>es</b> <b>Salaam,</b> Tanganyika, where she arrived on 17 November. She sailed on 20 November for Mombasa, Kenya, arriving the next day. She sailed a week later for Aden, from where she departed on 9 December for Suez and Port Said, arriving at the latter port on 19 December. Fort Stikine {{was a member of}} Convoy GUS25, which departed from Port Said on 16 December. The convoy, consisting 106 merchant ships escorted by sixteen warships over its duration, arrived at the Hampton Roads on 17 January 1944. One merchant vessel was lost to enemy action. Fort Stikine left the convoy at Gibraltar, where she arrived on 28 December 1943.|$|E
