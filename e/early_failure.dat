5|$|Planning for dental {{implants}} {{focuses on}} the general health condition of the patient, the local health condition of the mucous membranes and the jaws and the shape, size, and position of {{the bones of the}} jaws, adjacent and opposing teeth. There are few health conditions that absolutely preclude placing implants although there are certain conditions that can increase the risk of failure. Those with poor oral hygiene, heavy smokers and diabetics are all at greater risk for a variant of gum disease that affects implants called peri-implantitis, increasing the chance of long-term failures. Long-term steroid use, osteoporosis and other diseases that affect the bones can increase the risk of <b>early</b> <b>failure</b> of implants.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{called for}} Hubble to be {{serviced}} in February 2005, but the Columbia disaster in 2003, {{in which the}} orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions {{had to be able}} to reach the safe haven of the International Space Station should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled. This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk. HST's planned successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST. The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an <b>early</b> <b>failure,</b> only makes these concerns more acute. On the other hand, many astronomers felt strongly that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget.|$|E

40|$|Aim. To {{investigate}} {{whether there is}} a correlation between <b>early</b> dental implant <b>failure</b> and low serum levels of vitamin D. Methods. All patients treated with dental implants in a single centre, in the period 2003 – 2015, were considered for enrollment in this study. The main outcome was <b>early</b> implant <b>failure.</b> The influence of patient-related variables on implant survival was calculated using the Chi-square test. Results. 822 patients treated with 1625 implants were selected for this study; 27 <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> (3. 2 %) were recorded. There was no link between gender, age, smoking, history of periodontitis, and an increased incidence of <b>early</b> <b>failures.</b> Statistical analysis reported 9 <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> (2. 2 %) in patients with serum levels of vitamin D > 30 [*]ng/mL, 16 <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> (3. 9 %) in patients with levels between 10 and 30 [*]ng/mL, and 2 <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> (9. 0 %) in patients with levels < 10 [*]ng/mL. Although there was an increasing trend in the incidence of <b>early</b> implant <b>failures</b> with the worsening of vitamin D deficiency, the difference between these 3 groups was not statistically significant (P= 0. 15). Conclusions. This study failed in proving an effective link between low serum levels of vitamin D and an increased risk of <b>early</b> implant <b>failure.</b> Further studies are needed to investigate this topic...|$|R

25|$|When a {{concrete}} structure is designed, it is usual {{to specify the}} concrete cover for the rebar (the depth of the rebar within the object). The minimum concrete cover is normally regulated by design or building codes. If the reinforcement {{is too close to}} the surface, <b>early</b> <b>failure</b> due to corrosion may occur. The concrete cover depth can be measured with a cover meter. However, carbonated concrete incurs a durability problem only when there is also sufficient moisture and oxygen to cause electropotential corrosion of the reinforcing steel.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this presentation is to gain insight into possible failure mechanisms in BaTiO 3 -based ceramic capacitors that {{may be associated with}} the reliability degradation that accompanies a reduction in dielectric thickness, as reported by Intel Corporation in 2010. The volumetric efficiency (microF/cm 3) of a multilayer ceramic capacitor (MLCC) has been shown to not increase limitlessly due to the grain size effect on the dielectric constant of ferroelectric ceramic BaTiO 3 material. The reliability of an MLCC has been discussed with respect to its structure. The MLCCs with higher numbers of dielectric layers will pose more challenges for the reliability of dielectric material, which is the case for most base-metal-electrode (BME) capacitors. A number of MLCCs manufactured using both precious-metal-electrode (PME) and BME technology, with 25 V rating and various chip sizes and capacitances, were tested at accelerated stress levels. Most of these MLCCs had a failure behavior with two mixed failure modes: the well-known rapid dielectric wearout, and so-called 'early failures. " The two failure modes can be distinguished when the testing data were presented and normalized at use-level using a 2 -parameter Weibull plot. The <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> had a slope parameter of Beta > 1, indicating that the <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> are not infant mortalities. <b>Early</b> <b>failures</b> are triggered due to external electrical overstress and become dominant as dielectric layer thickness decreases, accompanied by a dramatic reduction in reliability. This indicates that <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> are the main cause of the reliability degradation in MLCCs as dielectric layer thickness decreases. All of the <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> are characterized by an avalanche-like breakdown leakage current. The failures have been attributed to the extrinsic minor construction defects introduced during fabrication of the capacitors. A reliability model including dielectric thickness and extrinsic defect feature size is proposed in this presentation. The model can be used to explain the Intel-reported reliability degradation in MLCCs with respect to the reduction of dielectric thickness. It {{can also be used to}} estimate the reliability of a MLCC based on its construction and microstructure parameters such as dielectric thickness, average grain size, and number of dielectric layers. Measures for preventing <b>early</b> <b>failures</b> are also discussed in this document...|$|R
25|$|The character's {{overseas}} debut, now as Edna Everage, was in {{the early}} 1960s at comedian Peter Cook's nightclub, The Establishment, in London's West End, where she received a poor review from Bamber Gascoigne, then the drama critic for The Spectator. Barry Humphries cites Cook as being instrumental in launching Edna's UK career. While her first appearances at the Establishment Club was a flop, the mousy Edna being too quiet to please that raucous crowd, a 2016 interviewer William Cook saw the <b>early</b> <b>failure</b> as a blessing, so that Humphries spent the sixties as a jobbing actor rather than as a pampered star.|$|E
25|$|Sulfates (SO4) in {{the soil}} or in groundwater, in {{sufficient}} concentration, can react with the Portland cement in concrete causing the formation of expansive products, e.g., ettringite or thaumasite, {{which can lead to}} <b>early</b> <b>failure</b> of the structure. The most typical attack of this type is on concrete slabs and foundation walls at grades where the sulfate ion, via alternate wetting and drying, can increase in concentration. As the concentration increases, the attack on the Portland cement can begin. For buried structures such as pipe, this type of attack is much rarer, especially in the eastern United States. The sulfate ion concentration increases much slower {{in the soil}} mass and is especially dependent upon the initial amount of sulfates in the native soil. A chemical analysis of soil borings to check for the presence of sulfates should be undertaken during the design phase of any project involving concrete in contact with the native soil. If the concentrations are found to be aggressive, various protective coatings can be applied. Also, in the US ASTM C150 Type 5 Portland cement can be used in the mix. This type of cement is designed to be particularly resistant to a sulfate attack.|$|E
500|$|A {{result of}} the enshrinement debate was that the Ministry of the Interior {{concentrated}} on distinctions of [...] "religion" [...] and [...] "doctrine", stating that [...] "Shinto rituals (shinsai) are performed by the state whereas religious doctrines (kyōhō) are {{to be followed by}} individuals and families." [...] Through this logic, Shinto rituals were a civic responsibility which all Japanese subjects were expected to participate in, whereas [...] "religious" [...] Shinto was a matter of personal faith and subject to freedom of religion. This debate marked an <b>early</b> <b>failure</b> in crafting of a unified national Shinto practice, and led to a sharp decline in both state grants to Shinto shrines and to the appointment of Shinto priests to government positions. The Ministry of Home Affairs took responsibility for shrines in 1877, and began to separate Shinto religious practices from indoctrination. In 1887, the Ministry stopped financial support for most shrines, aside from select Imperial shrines tied to state functions.|$|E

2500|$|After its {{introduction}} to service, reports of unserviceability of the M3 commenced in February 1944 with stateside units in training, who reported <b>early</b> <b>failure</b> of the cocking handle/bolt retraction mechanism on some weapons. [...] Similar reports later came from U.S. forces in Britain who were issued the M3. [...] An investigation revealed several {{deficiencies in the}} construction of the M3's bolt retraction mechanism, together with issues concerning barrel removal and retention as well as easily bent rear sights. [...] As a result, several product improvements were incorporated into all new M3 production, including a new design retracting pawl with improved heat treatment, a new spring stop fitted to the right-hand brace of the retracting lever, a modified ejector featuring a cocking lever trip, a larger ratchet pad with improved heat treatment to more securely retain the barrel assembly, and strengthening gussets fitted to the sides of the fixed 'L' rear sight. [...] After new complaints were raised about accidental magazine releases and failure of the wire buttstock to remain in place in the collapsed position, two additional changes were made to M3 production and approved by Ordnance on 31 August 1944. [...] This included a small sheet metal guard around the magazine release button, and the inclusion of a stop between the two rods forming the wire stock at the butt end.|$|E

2500|$|By 2010, {{reports in}} the {{orthopaedic}} literature increasingly cited the problem of <b>early</b> <b>failure</b> of metal on metal prostheses in {{a small percentage of}} patients. Failures may relate to release of minute metallic particles or metal ions from wear of the implants, causing pain and disability severe enough to require revision surgery in 1–3% of patients. Design deficits of some prothesis models, especially with heat-treated alloys and a lack of special surgical experience accounting for most of the failures. Surgeons at leading medical centers such as the Mayo Clinic have reported reducing their use of metal-on-metal implants by 80 percent over the last year in favor of those made from other materials, like combinations of metal and plastic. The cause of these failures remain controversial, and may include both design factors, technique factors, and factors related to patient immune responses (allergy type reactions). In the United Kingdom the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency commenced an annual monitoring regime for metal-on-metal hip replacement patients from May 2010. [...] Data which are shown in The Australian Orthopaedic Association's 2008 National Joint replacement registry, a record of nearly every hip implanted in that country over the previous 10 years, tracked 6,773 BHR (Birmingham Hip Resurfacing) Hips and found that less than one-third of one percent may have been revised due to the patient's reaction to the metal component. [...] Other similar metal-on-metal designs have not fared as well, where some reports show 76% to 100% of the people with these metal-on-metal implants and have aseptic implant failures requiring revision also have evidence of histological inflammation accompanied by extensive lymphocyte infiltrates, characteristic of delayed type hypersensitivity responses. It is not clear to what extent this phenomenon negatively affects orthopedic patients. However, for patients presenting with signs of an allergic reactions, evaluation for sensitivity should be conducted. Removal of the device that is not needed should be considered, since removal may alleviate the symptoms. [...] Patients who have allergic reactions to cheap jewelry {{are more likely to have}} reactions to orthopedic implants. [...] There is increasing awareness of the phenomenon of metal sensitivity and many surgeons now take this into account when planning which implant is optimal for each patient.|$|E
