25|$|Digital {{data can}} be encoded and {{transmitted}} via FM by shifting the carrier's frequency among a predefined set of frequencies representing digits - for example one frequency can represent a binary 1 and a second can represent binary 0. This modulation technique is known as <b>frequency-shift</b> keying (FSK). FSK is widely used in modems and fax modems, and {{can also be used}} to send Morse code. Radioteletype also uses FSK.|$|E
25|$|A numbers {{station is}} a shortwave radio station {{characterized}} by broadcasts of formatted numbers, which {{are believed to}} be addressed to intelligence officers operating in foreign countries. Most identified stations use speech synthesis to vocalize numbers, although digital modes such as phase-shift keying and <b>frequency-shift</b> keying, as well as Morse code transmissions, are not uncommon. Most stations have set time schedules, or schedule patterns; however, other stations appear to broadcast at random times. Stations {{may or may not have}} set frequencies in the HF band.|$|E

40|$|The ideal Penning trap {{consists}} of a uniform magnetic field and an electrostatic quadrupole potential. Cylindrically-symmetric deviations thereof are parametrized by the coefficients Bn and Cn, respectively. Relativistic mass-increase aside, the three characteristic eigenfrequencies of a charged particle stored in an ideal Penning trap are independent of the three motional amplitudes. This three-fold harmonicity is a highly-coveted virtue for precision experiments that rely on the measurement {{of at least one}} eigenfrequency in order to determine fundamental properties of the stored particle, such as its mass. However, higher-order contributions to the ideal fields result in amplitude-dependent <b>frequency-shifts.</b> In turn, these <b>frequency-shifts</b> need to be understood for estimating systematic experimental errors, and eventually for correcting them by means of calibrating the imperfections. The problem of calculating the <b>frequency-shifts</b> caused by small imperfections of a near-ideal trap yields nicely to perturbation theory, producing analytic formulas that are easy to evaluate for the relevant parameters of an experiment. In particular, the <b>frequency-shifts</b> can be understood on physical rather than purely mathematical grounds by considering which terms actually drive them. Based on identifying these terms, we derive general formulas for the first-order <b>frequency-shifts</b> caused by any perturbation parameter Bn or Cn. Comment: 18 pages, 1 figure, 0 tables.

25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds to the mark condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct <b>frequency-shift</b> keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according to the mark or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E
500|$|The {{shaping of}} {{a signal to}} convey {{information}} is known as modulation. Modulation {{can be used to}} represent a digital message as an analog waveform. This is commonly called [...] "keying" [...] – a term derived from the older use of Morse Code in telecommunications – and several keying techniques exist (these include phase-shift keying, <b>frequency-shift</b> keying, and amplitude-shift keying). The [...] "Bluetooth" [...] system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to exchange information between various devices. In addition, there are combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called (in the jargon of the field) [...] "quadrature amplitude modulation" [...] (QAM) that are used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.|$|E

Instead of the traditional <b>frequency-shift</b> keying, the information is transmitted by patterns of polarity-reversals (sometimes called 180-degree phase shifts). PSK31 was enthusiastically received, and its usage grew like wildfire worldwide, lending a new popularity and tone to the on-air conduct of digital communications. [...] Due to {{the efficiency of the}} mode, it became, and still remains, especially popular with operators whose circumstances do not permit the erection of large antenna systems, the use of high power, or both.|$|E
2500|$|A {{radio station}} at Rugby was first {{operated}} by the Post Office from 1926, with the call-sign GBR. From 19 December 1927, it broadcast a 15.8kHz time signal from the Royal Observatory which could be received worldwide. It consisted of 306 pulses in the five minutes {{up to and including}} 10:00 and 18:00 GMT, with a longer pulse at the start of each minute. <b>Frequency-shift</b> keying was added in 1967, making the signal harder to use as a frequency reference. The time signals, preceded by the callsign [...] "GBR GBR TIME" [...] in morse code, were transmitted during the 5 minutes preceding 03:00, 09:00, 15:00 and 21:00. Transmitter GBZ on 19.6kHz was used as a reserve, when GBR was off-air for maintenance. Eventually, time signals from GBR were terminated in November 1986 and it is no longer used as a frequency reference.|$|E
