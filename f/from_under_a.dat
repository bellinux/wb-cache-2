The standard procedure in these operations is to expose the thyroid gland so that a pathologist can take a sample, analyze it looking for carcinogenic cells, and then decide whether it needs to be removed. In Kirchner's case, this step was omitted and the gland was removed directly. After the operation, it was revealed that she had been misdiagnosed and did not have cancer. On 5 October 2013, doctors ordered Kirchner to rest for a month after they found blood on her brain caused by a head injury she received on 8 August 2012. She was re-admitted to hospital and had successful surgery on 8 October 2013 to remove blood <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> membrane covering her brain.|$|E

The match was long and intense, as Suzuki rode Rutten for most of their exchanges in the bout, and actually managed to force him to spend a rope escape with a tight kneebar. Rutten held his own through his defensive acumen, occasionally countering with guillotine chokes and a surprising rolling kneebar from standing, until the match came to its last minutes.

500|$|A further {{inspiration}} {{came from}} a story in Charlie Chaplin's autobiography; while touring with a British musical theatre, he stayed at a tenement home.

The son ("a half man with no legs, an oversized, blond, flat-shaped head, a sickening white face, a sunken nose, a large mouth," [...] according to Chaplin) [...] "flopp around" [...] while they sang and danced. Morgan used this incident within the screenplay, although at Wong's suggestion they changed the character to the boy's mother. It took some time for the concepts to come together into a story; elements {{first appeared in the}} second season episode [...] "Humbug", written by Morgan's brother Darin and featuring a cast of circus sideshow performers.

500|$|The {{symptoms}} of rhabdomyolysis depend on its severity and whether kidney failure develops. Milder forms may not cause any muscle symptoms, and {{the diagnosis is}} based on abnormal blood tests {{in the context of}} other problems. More severe rhabdomyolysis is characterized by muscle pain, tenderness, weakness and swelling of the affected muscles. If the swelling is very rapid, as may happen after someone is released <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> collapsed building, the movement of fluid from the bloodstream into damaged muscle may cause low blood pressure and shock. Other symptoms are nonspecific and result either from the consequences of muscle tissue breakdown or from the condition that originally led to the muscle breakdown. Release of the components of muscle tissue into the bloodstream causes electrolyte disturbances, which can lead to nausea, vomiting, confusion, coma or abnormal heart rate and rhythm. The urine may be dark, often described as [...] "tea-colored", due to the presence of myoglobin. Damage to the kidneys may give rise to decreased or absent urine production, usually 12 to 24hours after the initial muscle damage.|$|E

[...] Owen showed up the next day and, when Maulbetsch used him to illustrate blocking fundamentals, Owen threw a block into Maulbetsch that threw him five yards through the air. [...] Maulbetsch was satisfied, and Owen had a spot on the team. [...] Because Phillips was not part of a conference, it was not subject to any eligibility limitations, an advantage Maulbetsch was accused of exploiting.

[...] He discreetly removed hair <b>from</b> <b>under</b> <b>a</b> carpet and tried to flush it down the toilet, but the police stopped him; forensics later determined the hair to be Ng's.
