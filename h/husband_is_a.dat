25|$|Arthur Huntingdon, Helen's abusive and {{alcoholic}} <b>husband,</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Byronic {{figure of}} great fascination {{but also of}} barely concealed moral failings. His abusive behaviour impels Helen {{to run away from}} him, but nevertheless when he becomes ill (after falling from his horse when drunk and injuring his leg badly), Helen returns to Grassdale to take care of him. Unwilling to stop drinking alcohol, Huntingdon deteriorates in health and eventually dies. He is widely thought to be loosely based on the author's brother, Branwell, but some critics have argued that, apart from their masses of red hair, they have little in common. Along with Lord Lowborough, Huntingdon bears far stronger resemblance to two types of drunkards outlined in Robert Macnish's The Anatomy of Drunkenness.|$|E

And when it's the guy doing everything she just did in the previous scenes, it becomes all too familiar—which is Beyoncé's point." ...|$|E

Another writer felt that the interactions between Stan and Francine were inferior to previous episodes of the series and wrote, [...] "It breaks away from Francine and Stan's fun relationship and veers into the more conventional cartoon relationship, where the <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> buffoon and the wife has to keep him check." ...|$|E

The film (which marked the directorial debut of Rensil D'Silva) featured Kapoor as Avantika Ahuja, a woman who is confined to house arrest after discovering that her <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> terrorist. Describing the film as [...] "an emotionally draining experience", Kapoor explained that it was difficult to disconnect from her character.

Gaurav Malani of The Economic Times commented that after a long time the actress was given [...] "a role of substance that brings her performing potential to the fore", while Subhash K.

[...] Waters' <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> stockholder and former director of OneUnited Bank and the bank's executives were major contributors to her campaigns. In September 2008, Waters arranged meetings between U.S. Treasury Department officials and OneUnited Bank, so that the bank could plead for federal cash. [...] It had been heavily invested in Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and its capital was [...] "all but wiped out" [...] after the U.S. government took them over. The bank received $12 million in Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) money.

[...] Businessman and POW advocate Ross Perot paid for Carol's medical care, and she remained grateful, later remarking: [...] "The military families are in Ross's heart and in his soul...There are millions of us who are extremely grateful to Ross Perot".

2500|$|The novella {{begins with}} the droogs sitting in their {{favourite}} hangout, the Korova Milk Bar, and drinking [...] "milk-plus" [...] — a beverage consisting of milk laced with the customer's drug of choice — {{to prepare for a}} night of mayhem. They assault a scholar walking home from the public library; rob a store, leaving the owner and his wife bloodied and unconscious; beat up a beggar; then scuffle with a rival gang. Joyriding through the countryside in a stolen car, they break into an isolated cottage and terrorise the young couple living there, beating the husband and raping his wife. In a metafictional touch, the <b>husband</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> writer working on a manuscript called [...] "A Clockwork Orange", and Alex contemptuously reads out a paragraph that states the novel's main theme before shredding the manuscript. Back at the Korova, Alex strikes Dim for his crude response to a woman's singing of an operatic passage, and strains within the gang become apparent. At home in his parents' futuristic flat, Alex plays classical music at top volume, which he describes as giving him orgasmic bliss before falling asleep.|$|E
