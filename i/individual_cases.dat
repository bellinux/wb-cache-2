5|$|A {{number of}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} are recognized. Despite this, {{many people have}} overlapping symptoms that can make the classification difficult in <b>individual</b> <b>cases.</b> All types have partial forms.

5|$|Red foxes are {{the most}} {{important}} rabies vector in Europe. In London, arthritis is not uncommon in foxes, being particularly frequent in the spine. Foxes may be infected with leptospirosis and tularemia, though they are not overly susceptible to the latter. They may also fall ill from listeriosis and spirochetosis, as well as acting as vectors in spreading erysipelas, brucellosis and tick-born encephalitis. A mysterious fatal disease near Lake Sartlan in the Novosibirsk Oblast was noted among local red foxes, but the cause was undetermined. The possibility was considered that it was caused by an acute form of encephalomyelitis, which was first observed in captive bred silver foxes. <b>Individual</b> <b>cases</b> of foxes infected with Yersinia pestis are known.|$|E
50|$|Through the {{procedure}} of casuistry, Toulmin and Jonsen identified three problematic situations in moral reasoning: first, the type <b>case</b> fits the <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> only ambiguously; second, two type cases {{apply to the}} same <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> in conflicting ways; third, an unprecedented <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> occurs, which cannot be compared or contrasted to any type case. Through the use of casuistry, Toulmin demonstrated and reinforced his previous emphasis on the significance of comparison to moral arguments, a significance not addressed in theories of absolutism or relativism.|$|R
5000|$|Casuistry employs absolutist principles, called [...] "type cases" [...] or [...] "paradigm cases," [...] {{without resorting}} to absolutism.

An <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> is then compared and contrasted with the type <b>case.</b> Given an <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> that is completely identical to the type case, moral judgments can be made immediately using the standard moral principles advocated in the type <b>case.</b> If the <b>individual</b> <b>case</b> differs from the type case, the differences will be critically assessed in order {{to arrive at a}} rational claim.|$|R
