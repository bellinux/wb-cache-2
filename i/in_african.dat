This KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) based study investigates hypertension, glomerulonephritides and the {{rarity of}} IgA Nephropathy (IgAN) <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> <b>in</b> {{association}} with the Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA). A retrospective hypertensive study found a positive association with HLA-B 40 (P c< 0. 05) and HLA-B 15 (Pc< 0. 02) <b>in</b> Indians and <b>Africans</b> respectively. No association was found in Whites. A prospective study showed glomerulonephritides to be positively associated with HLA-A 33 in Indians (Pc 0. 049). No associations were found with glomerulonephritides <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> and Whites. Combined Race groups show no HLA associations. HLA-A 30; HLA-A 34; HLA-A 29; HLA-B 42; HLA-B 58; HLA-B 70 and HLA-DR 11 were extremely significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> compared to Indians and Whites (all P< 0. 0001). In conclusion, HLA-B 40 and I 1 LA-B 15 are possible disease susceptibility markers <b>in</b> Indian and <b>African</b> hypertensives; HLA-A 33 is a possible disease susceptibility marker for glomerulonephritides in Indians and alleles in linkage might {{be responsible for the}} rarity of IgAN <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> but further studies need to be employed...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVEdMetabolic risk andmetabolic {{syndrome}} (MetSyn) prevalence {{were compared}} <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> who {{immigrated to the}} U. S. and African Americans. If MetSyn were an effective pre-dictor of cardiometabolic risk, then the group with a worse metabolic risk profile would have {{a higher rate of}} MetSyn. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdCross-sectional analyses were performed on 95 men (39 Africans, 56 African Americans, age 38 6 6 years [mean 6 SD]). Glucose tolerance was determined by oral glucose tolerance test, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) was determined by computerized tomography, and MetSyn was determined by the presence of three of five factors: central obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of HDL cholesterol, hypertension, and fasting hyperglycemia. RESULTSdMetSyn prevalence was similar <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> and African Americans (10 vs. 13 %, P = 0. 74), but hypertension, glycemia (fasting and 2 -h glucose), and VAT were higher <b>in</b> <b>Africans.</b> CONCLUSIONSdAfrican immigrants have a worse metabolic profile than African Ameri-cans but a similar prevalence of MetSyn. Therefore, MetSyn may underpredict metabolic risk <b>in</b> <b>Africans...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background This study {{compared}} NT-proBNP {{levels and}} the association with cardiovascular markers between Africans and Caucasians from South Africa. Methods This cross-sectional study involved 201 Africans and 255 Caucasians from the North West province, South Africa. Serum NT-proBNP concentrations, blood pressure, pulse wave velocity and arterial compliance were measured. Results NT-proBNP levels {{were significantly higher}} (P < 0. 001) <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> than Caucasians, also after adjusting for gender, body mass index (BMI) and pulse wave velocity (P = 0. 008). This significant difference became borderline significant after adjusting for systolic blood pressure (SBP) (P = 0. 060), and non-significant after adjusting for arterial compliance (P = 0. 35). In single regression, a significant positive correlation of NT-proBNP with SBP (r = 0. 26; P < 0. 001) and pulse pressure (PP) (r = 0. 28; P < 0. 001) were shown for Africans only. After multiple adjustments, the associations of NT-proBNP with SBP and PP remained significant <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> (SBP: β = 0. 187, P < 0. 01; PP: β = 0. 234, P < 0. 001), with no significant associations in Caucasians. Conclusions NT-proBNP levels were higher <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> than Caucasians, independently of BMI and gender. This difference was partly driven by higher SBP and lower arterial compliance <b>in</b> <b>Africans.</b> NT-proBNP was persistently associated with SBP and PP <b>in</b> <b>Africans,</b> but not <b>in</b> Caucasians. These associations may suggest early vascular changes contributing to cardiac alterations <b>in</b> <b>Africans.</b> [URL]...|$|R
5|$|CYP2C9 polymorphisms explain 10% of {{the dose}} {{variation}} between patients, mainly among Caucasian patients as these variants are rare <b>in</b> <b>African</b> American and most Asian populations.

5|$|Cerebral malaria {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of {{neurological}} disabilities <b>in</b> <b>African</b> children. Studies comparing cognitive functions before and after treatment for severe malarial illness continued to show significantly impaired school performance and cognitive abilities even after recovery. Consequently, severe and cerebral malaria have far-reaching socioeconomic consequences that extend beyond the immediate effects of the disease.|$|E
5|$|EEHV1A (originally just {{known as}} EEHV1) {{was the first}} species/type identified, which causes an acute hemorrhagic disease with a very high {{mortality}} rate in Asian elephants. This form of the virus was originally believed to occur naturally <b>in</b> <b>African</b> elephants (occasionally producing skin nodules), and to be transmitted to Asian elephants within captivity, but more extensive studies have since largely disproved this concept because several other species/types of EEHV (e.g. EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6) instead have been identified <b>in</b> <b>African</b> elephants. A second lethal subtype, EEHV1B, was identified in Asian elephants in 2001. EEHV3, EEHV4 and EEHV5 have also each {{been responsible for the}} deaths of at least one Asian elephant calf.|$|E
40|$|The risk of {{cardiovascular}} disease is dramatically increasing <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> (black). The prothrombotic stress response contributes to atherothrombotic disease and is modulated by depressive symptoms. We examined coagulation reactivity to acute mental stress {{and its relation to}} psychological well-being <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> relative to Caucasians (white). A total of 102 African and 165 Caucasian school teachers underwent the Stroop Color-Word Conflict test. Circulating levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) antigen, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were measured before and after the Stroop. Cardiovascular reactivity measures were also obtained. All participants completed the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 and the General Health Questionnaire- 28 for the assessment of depressive symptoms and total psychological distress, respectively. After controlling for covariates, resting levels of VWF, fibrinogen, and D-dimer were higher <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> than <b>in</b> Caucasians (all p-values ≤ 0. 006). Depressive symptoms and psychological distress were not significantly associated with resting coagulation measures. Stress reactivity in VWF (p< 0. 001) and fibrinogen (p= 0. 016), but not in D-dimer (p= 0. 27), were decreased <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> relative to Caucasians with Africans showing greater reactivity of total peripheral resistance (p= 0. 017). Depressive symptoms, but not general psychological distress, were associated with greater VWF increase (p= 0. 029) and greater fibrinogen decrease (p= 0. 030) <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> relative to Caucasians. <b>In</b> conclusion, <b>Africans</b> showed greater hypercoagulability at rest but diminished procoagulant reactivity to acute mental stress when compared with Caucasians. Ethnic differences in the vascular adrenergic stress response might partially explain this finding. Depressive symptoms were associated with exaggerated VWF reactivity <b>in</b> <b>Africans</b> relative to Caucasians. The clinical implications of these findings for Africans need further study...|$|R
