25|$|Also {{during the}} 1810s, St. Louis merchants began facing {{the problem of}} too little bullion {{currency}} {{and an increase in}} the supply of unreliable paper currency issued by banks in Kentucky and Ohio. To improve upon the de facto barter economy of St. Louis, in December 1816 a group of merchants formed the Bank of St. Louis, which was chartered by the territorial legislature and accepted furs as collateral. However, the bank failed as a result of mismanagement and fraud on the part of its cashier. In early 1817, another group of merchants formed the Bank of Missouri, which initially was successful and became a United States <b>depository</b> <b>bank</b> with $150,000 in guaranteed deposits. However, the Second Bank of the United States contracted its currency policy in late 1818, causing the Panic of 1819 and the eventual closure of the Bank of Missouri.|$|E

50|$|The Dodd-Frank Act {{addressed}} these elements, {{but stopped}} short of breaking up the largest banks, which grew larger due to mergers of investment banks {{at the core of}} the crisis with <b>depository</b> <b>banks</b> (e.g., JP Morgan Chase acquired Bear Stearns and Bank of America acquired Merrill Lynch in 2008). Assets of five largest banks as a share of total commercial banking assets rose then stabilized in the wake of the crisis. During 2013, Senators John McCain (Republican) and Elizabeth Warren (Democratic) proposed a bill to separate investment and <b>depository</b> <b>banking,</b> to insulate <b>depository</b> <b>banks</b> from higher risk activities. These were separated prior to the 1999 repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act.|$|R

5000|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>depository</b> <b>banks,</b> investment banks generally obtain funds from sophisticated investors and often make complex, risky investments with the funds, speculating either {{for their own}} account or {{on behalf of their}} investors. They also are [...] "market makers" [...] in that they serve as intermediaries between two investors that wish to take opposite sides of a financial transaction. The Glass-Steagall Act separated investment and <b>depository</b> <b>banking</b> until its repeal in 1999. Prior to 2008, the government did not explicitly guarantee the investor funds, so investment banks were not subject to the same regulations as <b>depository</b> <b>banks</b> and were allowed to take considerably more risk.|$|R

50|$|The crisis hit a {{critical}} point in September 2008 with the failure, buyout or bailout of the largest entities in the U.S. shadow banking system. Investment bank Lehman Brothers failed, while Merrill Lynch was purchased by Bank of America. Investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley obtained <b>depository</b> <b>bank</b> holding charters, which gave them access to emergency lines of credit from the Federal Reserve. Government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were {{taken over by the}} federal government. Insurance giant AIG, which had sold insurance-like protection for mortgage-backed securities, did not have the capital to honor its commitments; U.S. taxpayers covered its obligations instead in a bailout that exceeded $100 billion.|$|E

50|$|Unlike <b>depository</b> <b>banks,</b> {{investment}} banks raise capital to fund underwriting, market-making and trading {{for their own}} account or their clients; they {{are not subject to}} the same oversight or capital requirements. Large {{investment banks}} {{at the center of the}} crisis in September 2008, such as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch, were not subject to the same capital requirements as <b>depository</b> <b>banks</b> (see the section on the shadow banking system below for more information). The ratio of debt to equity (a measure of the risk taken) rose significantly from 2003 to 2007 for the largest five investment banks, which had $4.1 trillion in debt by the end of 2007.|$|R

5000|$|However, <b>depository</b> <b>banks</b> {{had moved}} sizable amounts of assets and {{liabilities}} off-balance sheet, via complex legal entities called special purpose vehicles. This allowed the banks to remove these amounts from the capital requirements computation, allowing them to take on more risk, but make higher profits during the pre-crisis boom period. When these off-balance sheet vehicles encountered difficulties beginning in 2007, many <b>depository</b> <b>banks</b> were required to cover their losses. Martin Wolf wrote in June 2009: [...] "...an enormous part of what banks did {{in the early part}} of this decade - the off-balance-sheet vehicles, the derivatives and the 'shadow banking system' itself - was to find a way round regulation." ...|$|R
5000|$|Shadow {{institutions}} {{typically do}} not have banking licenses; they do not take deposits as a <b>depository</b> <b>bank</b> would and therefore {{are not subject to}} the same regulations. [...] Complex legal entities comprising the system include hedge funds, structured investment vehicles (SIV), special purpose entity conduits (SPE), money market funds, repurchase agreement (repo) markets and other non-bank financial institutions. Many shadow banking entities are sponsored by banks or are affiliated with banks through their subsidiaries or parent bank holding companies. The inclusion of money market funds in the definition of shadow banking has been questioned in view of their relatively simple structure and the highly regulated and unleveraged nature of these entities, which are considered safer, more liquid, and more transparent than banks.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial / <b>Depository</b> <b>bank</b> corporations: The {{earnings}} {{reported by}} major banks are {{adversely affected by}} defaults on various asset types, including loans made for mortgages, credit cards, and auto loans. Companies value these assets (receivables) based on estimates of collections. Companies record expenses {{in the current period}} to adjust this valuation, increasing their bad debt reserves and reducing earnings. Rapid or unexpected changes in asset valuation can lead to volatility in earnings and stock prices. The ability of lenders to predict future collections is a complex task subject to a multitude of variables. Additionally, a bank's mortgage losses may cause it to reduce lending or seek additional funds from the capital markets, if necessary to maintain compliance with capital reserve regulatory requirements. Many banks also bought mortgage-backed securities and suffered losses on these investments.|$|E

50|$|Another major banking regulation, the Glass-Steagall Act from 1933, was {{effectively}} repealed in 1999.

25|$|Fed chair Ben Bernanke {{explained}} in 2010 that vulnerabilities {{in the global}} financial system built up {{over a long period}} of time, and then specific triggering events set the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis into motion. For example, vulnerabilities included failure to regulate the risk-taking of the non-depository banking sector, the so-called shadow banks such as investment banks and mortgage companies. These companies had outgrown the regulated <b>depository</b> <b>banking</b> sector, but did not have the same safeguards. Further, financial connections were established between the <b>depository</b> <b>banks</b> and shadow banks (e.g., via securitization and special purpose entities) that created dependencies that were not well understood by regulators. Certain types of derivatives, essentially bets on the performance of other securities, remained largely unregulated and were another opaque source of dependencies.|$|R
