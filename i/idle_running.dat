50|$|Bernoulli's principle, {{which is}} a {{function}} of the velocity of the fluid, is a dominant effect for large openings and large flow rates, but since fluid flow at small scales and low speeds (low Reynolds number) is dominated by viscosity, Bernoulli's principle is ineffective at <b>idle</b> or slow <b>running</b> and in the very small carburetors of the smallest model engines. Small model engines have flow restrictions ahead of the jets to reduce the pressure enough to suck the fuel into the air flow. Similarly the <b>idle</b> and slow <b>running</b> jets of large carburetors are placed after the throttle valve where the pressure is reduced partly by viscous drag, rather than by Bernoulli's principle.

40|$|Annoyance {{response}} to vehicle noise is commonly reported. The impact reduction measures {{must therefore be}} measured scientifically. A scientific system for describing and defining annoyance is therefore required. There is furthermore a need to reduce the annoying components of the sound of vehicles. The engine of a vehicle {{is one of the}} predominant sources of vehicle noise which cause annoyance. The sounds of engines heard outside of engines at <b>idling,</b> <b>running</b> and accelerating conditions have been reported to cause annoyance throughout the world. This study of sound quality focuses on noise heard outside vehicles, termed external vehicle noise, and which is outside the interior of the car, in free field conditions. The objectives of the study are a) the development of new descriptors and annoyance prediction models at <b>idling</b> and <b>running</b> conditions, b) comparison of several rating methods, c) testing of several recording and reproduction techniques, d) testing of the long-term repeatability of annoyance judgement obtained in tests, and e) comparison of the combustion process of various fuels in terms of annoyance. An annoyance prediction model for idling engine sound was developed using multivariate analysis {{on the basis of a}} new parameter which is termed "Ear Reasoning Range". Two further psychoacoustic descriptors, loudness and impulsiveness were also defined in the model. The sound spectrum which caused least annoyance was obtained by subjective adjustments to an idling engine sound. The quality of the sound was validated by subjective judgements, by test persons, and by objective measurements. An annoyance index for heavy-duty engine noise was developed on the basis of three psychoacoustic descriptors: loudness, sharpness, and harmonic ratio. The model was validated internally and externally and gave good predictions of annoyance judgement of 6 -cylinder inline engine noise. Three rating techniques known as the method of paired comparisons, the method of equal-appearing intervals and the method of successive intervals were investigated with respect to annoyance judgements of engine noise in free field conditions. The method of successive intervals was shown to be useful for annoyance judgements of engine noise for a large number of samples. The annoyance {{response to}} engine sounds recorded by an artificial head did not differ significantly from that recorded by an orthostereophonic technique. The variance in annoyance response for headphone reproduction was higher than that for loundspeaker reproduction. It was found that both recording techniques gave similar predictions of annoyance. Subjects preferred loudspeaker reproduction to headphone reproduction. There was no significant difference in annoyance judgements between experienced and naive listeners. Annoyance judgements of engine noise were shown to be consistent when subjects were asked to judge the same stimuli on two occasions 10 - 20 days apart. A comparison of multivariate analysis and neural networks for modeling annoyance of engine noise in free field conditions was investigated. Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression and Neural Networks were used to develop the annoyance prediction models on the basis of loudness, sharpness and harmonic ratio (rumble noise). PLS regression and Neural Networks gave similar prediction of annoyance for engine noise but neural networks gave greater prediction accuracy than did PLS regression. Annoyance judgements of engine sounds in respect to six different fuels were investigated by forty subjects. The annoyance judgements were found to be consistent with the annoyance index based on loudness, sharpness and harmonic ratio. Engine sounds due to ethanol fuel with 9 % beraid were rated as least annoying whereas engine sounds due to a mixture of diesel and ethanol fuels were rated as most annoying.

This paper proposes an {{analytical}} model to describe rock drilling processes using drag bits and rotary drills, and to induce relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke).

40|$|AbstractTo {{evaluate}} the {{unconfined compressive strength}} (UCS) of rocks from drilling data is a promising in-situ method and has been studied by many researchers. In most studies, experimental methods {{have been used to}} determine the relationship between UCS and drilling data. In this paper, an analytical model is proposed to describe rock drilling processes using drag bits and rotary drills, and to deduce the relations among rock properties, bit shapes, and drilling parameters (rotary speed, thrust, torque, and stroke). In this model, a drilling process is divided into cycles, each of which includes two motions: feeding and cutting. Feeding is treated as an indentation motion. There is a linear relation between indentation pressure (thrust) and the indentation depth (penetration rate). The cutting forces and friction forces of both the rake surface and the flank surface are examined. Also, a virtual base is set to the model to simulate the contact surface between the flank surface of the bit and the rock. According to this model, drilling torque consists of four parts respectively generated from cutting, friction, feeding, and <b>idle</b> <b>running.</b> Torque caused by friction and <b>idle</b> <b>running</b> is ineffective for drilling, whereas that caused by cutting and indentation is effective. Similar to torque, specific energy also has four parts respectively from cutting, friction, feeding, and <b>idle</b> <b>running.</b> For the purposes of this study, effective specific energy is defined as the sum of specific energy consumed by cutting and feeding. Effective specific energy is independent of the penetration rate. Since it is proportional to the UCS of the rocks, it is not influenced by the penetration rate, and is more useful in the evaluation of UCS than other parameters. Some laboratory and field tests were conducted, and the results verified the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed model...|$|E

Even though these computers see little {{use in the}} course of the day, they often remain powered, even when idle. Leaving <b>idle</b> PCs <b>running</b> is not only wasteful, but with rising energy costs it is increasingly more expensive. We propose partial migration of idle desktop sessions into the cloud to achieve energyproportional computing. Partial migration only propagates the small footprint of state that will be needed during idle period execution, and returns the session to the PC when it is no longer idle. We show that this approach can reduce energy usage of an idle desktop by up to 50 % over an hour and by up to 69 % overnight. We show that idle desktop sessions have small working sets, up to an order of magnitude smaller than their allocated memory, enabling significant consolidation ratios. We also show that partial VM migration can save medium to large size organizations tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars annually. ...|$|R

I like to watch the great ships standing out to sea or coming home richly laden, the active little steam-tugs confidently puffing with them to and from the sea- horizon, the fleet of barges that seem to have plucked their brown and russet sails from the ripe trees in the landscape, the heavy old colliers, light in ballast, floundering down before the tide, the light screw barks and schooners imperiously holding a straight course while the others patiently tack and go about, the yachts with their tiny hulls and great white sheets of canvas, the little sailing-boats bobbing to and fro on their errands of pleasure or business, and--as it is the nature of little people to do--making a prodigious fuss about their small affairs. Watching these objects, I still am under no obligation to think about them, or even so much as to see them, unless it perfectly suits my humour. As little am I obliged to hear the plash and flop of the tide, the ripple at my feet, the clinking windlass afar off, or the humming steam-ship paddles further away yet. These, with the creaking little jetty on which I sit, and the gaunt high-water marks and low-water marks in the mud, and the broken causeway, and the broken bank, and the broken stakes and piles leaning forward as if they were vain of their personal appearance and looking for their reflection in the water, will melt into any train of fancy. Equally adaptable to any purpose or to none, are the posturing sheep and kine upon the marshes, the gulls that wheel and dip around me, the crows (well out of gunshot) going home from the rich harvest-fields, the heron that has been out a-fishing and looks as melancholy, up there in the sky, as if it hadn't agreed with him.

The traction forces difference-steering asymmetric radial bogies are referred to as TFDA-bogies, in which the difference of longitudinal creep forces between front and rear wheels produces radial steering of both wheelsets. The concept of traction difference is incorporated into guiding control and bogie structure is also simplified in the form of asymmetrical radial bogies.

This paper provides a novel formulation for this scheduling puzzle, in which an optimal solution is computed through a sequence of Binate Covering Problems, hinged within a Bounded Model Checking paradigm. In this approach, each covering instance, providing a min-cost trace for a given schedule depth, can be solved with several strategies, resorting to Minimum-Cost Satisfiability solvers or Pseudo-Boolean Optimization tools. Unfortunately, all direct resolution methods show very low efficiency and scalability. As a consequence, we introduce a specialized method to solve the same sequence of problems, based on a traditional all-solution SAT solver. This approach follows the "circuit cofactoring" strategy, as it exploits a powerful technique to capture a large set of solutions for any new SAT counter-example. The overall method is completed with a branch-and-bound heuristic which evaluates lower and upper bounds of the schedule length, to reduce the state space that has to be visited.
