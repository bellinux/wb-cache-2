5|$|While the {{batteries}} were playing, {{a man was}} perceived on the breach, advancing and waving his hand. The guns ceased firing for a while, and the man came into {{the batteries}}: he {{proved to be a}} Ghoorkha, whose lower jaw had been shattered by a cannon shot, and who came thus <b>frankly</b> to solicit assistance from his enemy.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, Frank was {{admitted}} to the bar in Massachusetts. While in state and local government, he taught, part-time, at the University of Massachusetts Boston, the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and at Boston University. He published numerous articles on politics and public affairs; in 1992, he published Speaking <b>Frankly,</b> an essay on the role the Democratic Party should play in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Parliamentary {{privilege}} protects contentious {{views expressed}} by MPs {{in the course}} of parliamentary proceedings in the interest of their constituents or the general public, and thus effectively buoys the right of free speech and expression. Members can speak freely and express themselves <b>frankly</b> in Parliament without fearing legal consequences because they are immune from any civil or criminal proceedings, arrest, imprisonment or damages for what they have said.|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite <b>frankly</b> I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or to be caught with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Radford {{reported}} to Pensacola, Florida, for flight training, and {{was promoted to}} lieutenant soon thereafter. During the 1920s and 1930s his sea duty alternated among several aircraft squadrons, fleet staffs, and tours in the U.S. with the Bureau of Aeronautics. It was during this time, while he served under Rear Admiral William Moffett, that he frequently interacted with politicians {{and picked up the}} political acumen that would become useful later in his career. While he did not attend the Naval War College, as other rising officers did, Radford established himself as an effective officer who would speak his mind <b>frankly,</b> even to superiors.|$|E
5|$|In January 1917, {{a second}} mounted division– the Imperial Mounted Division– was formed from the 3rd and 4th Light Horse Brigades and the British 5th and 6th Yeomanry Brigades. A British regular army officer fresh from {{experience}} in the Senussi Campaign, Major General Sir H. W. Hodgson, was appointed to command, with an all-British staff. The deliberate mixing of Australian and Imperial troops was done with Chauvel's approval but was contrary to {{the policy of the}} Australian Government, which soon registered its displeasure, sending Brigadier General Sir Robert Anderson to Cairo to discuss the matter <b>frankly</b> with Chauvel and his superiors. As a result, the Imperial Mounted Division was renamed the Australian Mounted Division.|$|E
5|$|The Thousand-Year Door {{contains}} several characters, {{the majority}} of whom are not playable. Progression in the game is sometimes dependent on interaction with non-player characters, although many {{are used in the}} game's various subquests. In particular, the Goomba Professor <b>Frankly,</b> who knows the most about the mysteries relating to Rogueport, must be visited every time Mario retrieves a Crystal Star. The game continues the tradition of Paper Mario, in which Mario can be accompanied by one assistant character at a set time. There are seven party members in total: Goombella the Goomba, Koops the Koopa, Madame Flurrie the wind spirit, a Yoshi (named by the player), Vivian the Shadow Siren, Admiral Bobbery the Bob-omb, and Ms. Mowz, who is available as an optional character.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from South Africa, Harvey embarrassed the Board of Control when he <b>frankly</b> discussed his financial situation during a television interview. He {{revealed that the}} players earned only £85 per Test {{and that he was}} almost broke, despite being an automatic selection for Australia. Ten years of making time for cricket had disrupted his working life, so he was contemplating a move to South Africa, the homeland of his wife, Iris. Consequently, Harvey received a job offer to work as a sales supervisor for a glass manufacturer in Sydney, so he moved to New South Wales and gave up the Victorian captaincy. As a new player to NSW, he was behind vice-captain Richie Benaud in the state's pecking order, despite being the Test vice-captain, ahead of Benaud. Fatefully, Craig was unfit {{for the start of the}} 1958–59 season, due to the after-effects of hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens with}} an {{introduction}} about a seaside town which was damaged by a cataclysm and consequently {{sunk into the}} depths of the earth. A town named Rogueport was later built at this site, with the fortunes of the lost kingdom fabled to exist behind the eponymous Thousand-Year Door, located in the ruins of the old town. Mario becomes involved when Princess Peach contacts him about a treasure map that she bought in Rogueport, but becomes part of a larger adventure after learning that Peach has gone missing. With the help of Goombella and Professor <b>Frankly,</b> Mario learns that the map can potentially reveal the location of the 7 legendary Crystal Stars, which are required to unlock the Thousand-Year Door. Under the assumption that Peach herself is trying to find the Crystal Stars, he uses the map in an attempt to locate her.|$|E
5|$|Under the Kingdom, Sicily's {{products}} went to {{many different}} lands. Among these were Genoa, Pisa, the Byzantine Empire, and Egypt. Over {{the course of}} the 12th century, Sicily became an important source of raw materials for north Italian cities such as Genoa. As the centuries went on, however, this economic relationship became less advantageous to Sicily, and some modern scholars see the relationship as <b>frankly</b> exploitative. Furthermore, many scholars believe that Sicily went into decline in the late Middle Ages, though they are not agreed on when this decline occurred. Clifford Backman argues that {{it is a mistake to}} see the economic history of Sicily in terms of victimization, and contends that the decline really began in the second part of the reign of Frederick III, in contrast to earlier scholars who believed that Sicilian decline had set in earlier. Where earlier scholars saw late medieval Sicily in continuous decline, Stephen Epstein argued that Sicilian society experienced something of a revival in the 15th century.|$|E
25|$|She {{was also}} {{actively}} bisexual {{in her early}} life and <b>frankly</b> detailed her physical encounters with women in her autobiography Intimate Memories (1933).|$|E
25|$|And {{would be}} {{directly}} affected by this legislation. And I was astonished to find that it's proposed they be banned and, <b>frankly,</b> so were very many gay men.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though most}} of his motets use <b>frankly</b> Renaissance contrapuntal idiom, he often used the basso continuo, a {{relatively}} recent innovation of the early Baroque, and also used instrumental doublings of the vocal parts.|$|E
25|$|Mark Twain's sarcastic {{summation}} of Rhodes ("I admire him, I <b>frankly</b> confess it; {{and when his}} time comes I shall buy {{a piece of the}} rope for a keepsake"), from Chapter LXIX of Following the Equator, still often appears in collections of famous insults.|$|E
25|$|Considered racy at the time, Kerouac's {{writings}} are {{now considered}} mild. On the Road mentions Neal Cassady's bisexuality without comment, while Visions of Cody confronts it. However, the first novel does show Cassady as <b>frankly</b> promiscuous. Kerouac's novels feature an interracial love affair (The Subterraneans), and group sex (The Dharma Bums). The relationships among men in Kerouac's novels are predominantly homosocial.|$|E
25|$|Most {{mutations}} are disasters, {{but perhaps}} some inspired few are not. Can mutations be inspired? Here is the ideological watershed, {{the division between}} atheistic evolution and theistic evolution, and <b>frankly</b> it lies beyond science to prove the matter {{one way or the}} other. Science will not collapse if some practitioners are convinced that occasionally there has been creative input in the long chain of being.|$|E
25|$|A {{large number}} of variant {{annotation}} tools are available for variant annotation {{but in some cases}} the prediction by the tools does not agree since the way the rules have been defined differ slightly between each application. It is <b>frankly</b> impossible to perform a perfect comparison of the tools. Not all the tools have same input and output and function. Here is a table of major annotation tools and it's functional area.|$|E
25|$|In 1946 {{he was one}} of the BBC radio {{commentary}} {{team for}} the Tests between England and India. In 1953 he gave a 3-hour interview to the BBC which was edited down to 30 minutes for the programme <b>Frankly</b> Speaking. In 1955, he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews for the fifth episode of the new television show This Is Your Life. Amongst the friends gathered to relive his best moments were Jack Hobbs and Sydney Barnes.|$|E
25|$|Many such {{societies}} exist which {{operate as}} honoraries on one campus, and {{which may have}} been at one time actual meeting societies, and which are kept alive by one or two dedicated local alumni or an alumni affairs or Dean's office person, who see to it that an annual initiation are held every year. Some of these <b>frankly</b> state that they are honoraries, other seek to perpetuate the image of a continuing active society where there is none.|$|E
25|$|In April 1938, Papadima {{signed a}} congratulatory article {{addressed}} to the justice system. This came after a tribunal ordered avant-garde writer Geo Bogza to be imprisoned for publishing some <b>frankly</b> erotic poems. On the occasion, Papadima furnished a list of other writers who, he claimed, were guilty of that offense: Aderca, H. Bonciu, and Max Blecher. The text referred to the former two solely under their Jewish names (respectively, Froim Aderca and Haimovici Bonciu), which neither were using in their literary careers.|$|E
25|$|Around 1500, Mouton {{seems to}} have {{become more aware of}} chords and {{harmonic}} feeling, probably due to his encounter with Italian music. At any rate this was a period of transition between purely linear thinking in music, in which chords were incidental occurrences as a result of correct usage of intervals, and music in which the harmonic element was foremost (for example in lighter Italian forms such as the frottola, which are homophonic in texture and sometimes have <b>frankly</b> diatonic harmony).|$|E
25|$|Thomas Eakins {{was a man}} {{of great}} character. He {{was a man of}} iron will and his will to paint and to carry out his life as he thought it should go. This he did. It cost him heavily but in his works we have the {{precious}} result of his independence, his generous heart and his big mind. Eakins was a deep student of life, and with a great love he studied humanity <b>frankly.</b> He was not afraid of what his study revealed to him.|$|E
25|$|The Official Story can be {{considered}} alongside a group of other films that {{were the first to}} be made in Argentina after the downfall in 1983 of the last Argentine dictator, General Galtieri, and his autocratic regime. These films deal <b>frankly</b> with the repression, the torture, and the disappearances during Argentina's Dirty War in the 1970s and early 1980s; they include Funny Dirty Little War (1983) and Night of the Pencils (1986). A second group of films, which includes Verónico Cruz (1988) uses metaphor and hints at wider socio-political issues.|$|E
25|$|The {{desirability}} of hiring directors over 60 is fairly diminished in this marketplace. At the same time, I hadn't had a good-sized hit {{in quite a}} while. And, <b>frankly,</b> I went {{through a couple of}} experiences that left me pretty disgusted with it all, and I was thinking the time had passed. I was just sitting at home reading magazines and looking out the window — a couple of projects I had had just fallen apart — when I got a call from Sly, who had sent me a script.|$|E
25|$|But {{after seven}} months I {{dropped out of}} Dune, by then Rudy Wurlitzer {{had come up with}} a first-draft script which I felt was a decent {{distillation}} of Frank Herbert's. But I also realised Dune was {{going to take a lot}} more work—at least two and a half years' worth. And I didn't have the heart to attack that because my older brother Frank unexpectedly died of cancer while I was prepping the De Laurentiis picture. <b>Frankly,</b> that freaked me out. So I went to Dino and told him the Dune script was his.|$|E
25|$|Cleland's {{obituary}} in the Monthly Review {{said that}} he had been granted a government annuity of one hundred pounds to prevent his writing further obscenity for pay. However, no record of this has been found, and it is <b>frankly</b> doubtful. It is more likely that the report was invented by his eulogist. However, Cleland was celebrated for the quality of Fanny Hill, even if the work was no longer for sale in a legal edition in its entirety. Cleland became friends with David Garrick, and James Boswell sought out his company.|$|E
25|$|Schoenberg did {{not arrive}} {{immediately}} at the serial method. His first chamber work, the string sextet Verklärte Nacht, was mostly a late German romantic work, {{though it was}} bold in its use of modulations. The first work that was <b>frankly</b> atonal was the second string quartet; the last movement of this quartet, which includes a soprano, has no key signature. Schoenberg further explored atonality with Pierrot Lunaire, for singer, flute or piccolo, clarinet, violin, cello and piano. The singer uses a technique called Sprechstimme, halfway between speech and song.|$|E
25|$|Albert Einstein {{was widely}} known during his {{lifetime}} for his work with the theory of relativity and physics in general. His political opinions were of public interest {{through the middle of}} the 20th century due to his fame and involvement in political, humanitarian and academic projects around the world. He was often called upon to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. Einstein's visible position in society allowed him to speak and write <b>frankly,</b> even provocatively, {{at a time when many}} people were silenced due to the rise of the Nazi movement.|$|E
25|$|Harmison {{disappointed}} with {{the ball on the}} 2004–05 England tour of South Africa, taking just 9 wickets in the Test series at the extremely high average of 73.22. During this series, he spoke <b>frankly</b> about his homesickness on foreign tours. However, his solid performances with the bat, including an innings high score of 42 in the 3rd Test, led some commentators to note, not altogether jokingly, that he was now making a case to be considered a tail all-rounder. Despite these disappointments, he was still named as one of five cricketers of the year by Wisden Cricketer's Almanack in 2005.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, {{he opened}} the New York Daily Mirror, a racy tabloid <b>frankly</b> imitating the New York Daily News, Among his other {{holdings}} were two news services, Universal News and International News Service, or INS, the latter of which he founded in 1909. He also owned INS companion radio station WINS in New York); King Features Syndicate, which still owns the copyrights {{of a number of}} popular comics characters; a film company, Cosmopolitan Productions; extensive New York City real estate; and thousands of acres of land in California and Mexico, along with timber and mining interests inherited from his father.|$|E
25|$|Judging {{others by}} themselves, the English, who are blinded by their loyalty, have {{always thought that}} the Germans did not abide by their pledges inscribed in the Versailles Treaty because they had not <b>frankly</b> agreed to them...We, on the contrary, believe that if Germany, far from making the {{slightest}} effort {{to carry out the}} treaty of peace, has always tried to escape her obligations, it is because until now she has not been convinced of her defeat...We are also certain that Germany, as a nation, resigns herself to keep her pledged word only under the impact of necessity.|$|E
25|$|In May 1568 Mary, Queen of Scots fled to England, {{and flung}} herself on Elizabeth's protection. She had found refuge in Carlisle Castle, and the {{delicate}} duty of {{taking charge of}} the fugitive was entrusted jointly to Knollys and to Henry Scrope, 9th Baron Scrope of Bolton. On 28 May Knollys arrived at the castle, and was admitted to Mary's presence. At his first interview he was conscious of Mary's powerful fascination. But to her {{requests for an interview}} with Elizabeth, and for help to regain her throne, he returned the evasive answers which Elizabeth's advisers had suggested to him, and he <b>frankly</b> drew her attention to the suspicions in which Darnley's murder involved her.|$|E
25|$|According to Percival Serle, Denison {{was a man}} of high {{character}} and a good administrator. In his early days in Tasmania he spoke too <b>frankly</b> about the colonists in communications which he regarded as confidential, and this accentuated the feeling against him {{as a representative of the}} colonial office during the anti-transportation and responsible government movements. He showed great interest in the life of the colony, and helped to foster education, science and trade, during the period when Tasmania was developing into a prosperous colony. In New South Wales his task was easier, and he had no difficulty in coping adequately with the problems that arose during the early days of responsible government in Australia.|$|E
25|$|We don't give a {{damn about}} no white man law if you attack what we love. And <b>frankly,</b> it ain't none of your {{business}}. What do you got to say about it? Did you teach Malcolm? Did you make Malcolm? Did you clean up Malcolm? Did you put Malcolm out before the world? Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the hell business is it of yours? You just shut your mouth, and stay out of it. Because in the future, we gonna become a nation. And a nation gotta {{be able to deal with}} traitors and cutthroats and turncoats. The white man deals with his. The Jews deal with theirs.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{from the}} {{impression}} that even thus the comic element needed strengthening, or from the very natural desire to provide a good part for Mr. Denny, the author has introduced, in the M'Crankie, a figure which, though wholly unnecessary {{to the development of}} the plot, and in his surprising mixture of Scottish characteristics scarcely credible in any period, will probably have as much to say to the success of the new piece as any of the characters. It is true that the absurdities of the part would be more acceptable in one of the <b>frankly</b> extravagant inventions of the older librettist than in a more professedly historical, and one which presents in all other respects, faithful pictures of the place and period chosen.|$|E
25|$|The French {{victory in}} the Battle of Montenotte was {{completed}} on 12 April when French commander Napoleon Bonaparte concentrated about 25,000 troops near Carcare. To oppose them, Argenteau's division only had 9,000 scattered men and Giovanni Marchese di Provera was nearby with 2,000 more. Bonaparte directed Laharpe with 7,000 French troops to attack from Monte Negino while Masséna with 4,000 advanced from the south. After the defeat on the 12th, Argenteau <b>frankly</b> reported to Beaulieu that he was beaten and only had 700 men left. Having missed the day's combat, Rukavina was in Dego {{when he heard the}} bad news. On the morning of 14 April, he relinquished command of Dego because of his injury and retired to Acqui Terme, missing the Second Battle of Dego which began later that day.|$|E
