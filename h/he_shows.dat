5|$|Following {{the artist}} and amateur naturalist Abbott Handerson Thayer, Cott {{explains}} countershading with diagrams, photographs of models and examples of real animals. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> how helpful {{it would be for}} military camouflage with drawings of gun barrels.|$|E
5|$|In {{both that}} work and here, <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> himself {{wearing a red}} turban similar to that seen in the {{possible}} self-portrait Portrait of a Man, of 1433.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{begins by}} showing that an animal's surface and volume (or weight) {{increase}} with the square and cube of its length, respectively, and deducing simple rules for how bodies will change with size. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> {{in a few short}} equations that the speed of a fish or ship rises with the square root of its length. He then derives the slightly more complex scaling laws for birds or aircraft in flight. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> that an organism thousands of times smaller than a bacterium is essentially impossible.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>showed</b> him {{the shops}} of the china ware, [...] And of silk and sendal also, And <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> him the baths and the waterpipes [...] On arches aloft that go.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Widden nodded. [...] "Tuesday evening <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> her how <b>he</b> upset a man {{once and}} stood {{him on his}} head," [...] he said, irritably. [...] "I was what <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> her with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What did <b>he</b> <b>show</b> you?' asked Mr Boffin, {{putting his}} hands behind him, and eagerly {{advancing}} his head. 'Did <b>he</b> <b>show</b> you boxes, little cabinets, pocket-books, parcels, anything locked or sealed, anything tied up?' ...|$|R
5|$|A {{large crowd}} gathers outside the Verona Arena in Italy, with eager fans queuing {{to watch the}} {{performance}} of Jordan (Ranbir Kapoor), a rock musician. Despite being mobbed, Jordan manages to escape and reach the arena. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> a complete disregard for his fans, storms onto the stage {{in a fit of}} rage and starts strumming angrily on his guitar.|$|E
5|$|Artemis Fowl II– The protagonist; a 12-year-old genius, he {{uses his}} {{intelligence}} to obtain massive wealth through various illegal business ventures; this stems from his family, who have been criminals for generations. While he seems cold and distant at the beginning, his character develops throughout, and <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> remorse, guilt, and passion for his family at the end.|$|E
5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention to moral themes. For example, <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
60|$|Beasley {{rose to his}} feet. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> no {{disappointment}} or chagrin, but {{the bold}} pleasantness left his face, and, slight as that change was, it stripped him of the only redeeming quality <b>he</b> <b>showed.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{exhibited}} at the Royal Academy between 1777 and 1793. The first piece <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> was a Design for a Lunatic Asylum, but after that <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> mostly portraits. <b>He</b> won a silver medal in 1782.|$|R
50|$|His later studies centred {{mainly on}} the theory of {{differentiable}} economies, where <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that, in general, aggregate excess demand functions vanish at {{a finite number of}} points - basically, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that economies have a finite number of price equilibria.|$|R
5|$|Conspiracy theorist Alan Krumwiede (Jude Law) posts videos {{about the}} virus on his popular blog. In one video, <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> himself sick and later claims he {{recovered}} using a homeopathic cure derived from forsythia. In a panic, people seeking forsythia overwhelm pharmacies, spreading and accelerating the contagion as the infected {{come into contact}} with healthy people.|$|E
5|$|Eggs {{are what}} Thompson calls simple solids of revolution, varying from the nearly spherical eggs of owls through more typical ovoid eggs like chickens, to the {{markedly}} pointed eggs of cliff-nesting birds like the guillemot. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> that {{the shape of}} the egg favours its movement along the oviduct, a gentle pressure on the trailing end sufficing to push it forwards. Similarly, sea urchin shells have teardrop shapes, such as would be taken up by a flexible bag of liquid.|$|E
5|$|Glenda {{arrives at}} the farm with the Imperial, and urges him to leave with her for Freegate to do the show. On their way back, Deke confesses to Glenda that his real surname is Tompkins. Deciding to {{disclose}} his past, they drive to Allen City, to the Woodbine cemetery, where <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> her the Tomb of Deke Rivers. He explains that when the orphanage he lived in burned down eleven years earlier, he decided to bury his past, and took Rivers' name.|$|E
50|$|Subsequently, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> with Peter Tatistcheff.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>showed</b> at Société des Artistes Indépendants in 1911.|$|R
50|$|With Matthew Foreman <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> {{that the}} Banach-Tarski {{decomposition}} is possible with pieces with the Baire property, solving {{a problem of}} Marczewski that remained unsolved for more than 60 years.With Chris Freiling and Ken Zeger, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that linear codes are insufficient to gain the full advantages of network coding.|$|R
5|$|He is {{also present}} in the {{spin-off}} fighting games Dissidia Final Fantasy and Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy, wherein he is voiced by Shigeru Chiba (Dave Wittenberg in English localization). As well as these appearances, <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> up in Theatrhythm Final Fantasy, Final Fantasy Artniks, and Final Fantasy All the Bravest as an enemy boss character.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Victor and {{his mother}} scream at each other because she had had sex with Oscar, {{and because of that}} Victor had {{informed}} the police about Oscar's drug dealing; Victor is then thrown out of his parents' home. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> up at Linda's apartment and apologizes for having had her brother killed, but says Linda is partially to blame since she hung around with creeps. This angers Linda, who repeatedly screams that Victor should just go kill himself.|$|E
5|$|The Simpsons visit a {{high-tech}} gadget store and Bart buys a gimmicky utility belt from Comic Book Guy for $4. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> off its features to his classmates {{until he is}} beaten up by Dolph, Jimbo and Kearney, who steal the belt. In response, Homer decides {{to talk with the}} bullies' fathers at Moe's Tavern, but he is also beaten; however, they are unnerved when they cannot even knock Homer down, and are then chased away by a shotgun-wielding Moe.|$|E
5000|$|In 2017 {{he had an}} {{exposition}} in Museum Voorlinden in the Netherlands titled Say Cheese. In {{this exhibition}} <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> a wall with 1000 broccoli prints in various colors, he filled a room with blue balloons for walking through. In another room <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> many metronomes were ticking at different speeds.|$|R
50|$|In 1899, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that {{bicycles}} {{could be}} self stable.|$|R
50|$|At the Gijon (active) tournament of 1988, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>he</b> {{was a fine}} {{player of}} rapid chess too, {{finishing}} joint first with Anatoly Karpov.|$|R
5|$|The {{theme of}} suicide is also {{important}} in several of his earlier films. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> how the desire to self-harm is often counteracted by humanity {{and the need to}} help others in the face of death. This illustrates the ongoing life force and the power of life over death.|$|E
5|$|Thompson {{considers}} the laws governing {{the shapes of}} cells, at least in simple cases such as the fine hairs (a cell thick) in the rhizoids of mosses. He analyses the geometry of cells in a frog's egg when it has divided into 4, 8 and even 64 cells. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> that uniform growth can lead to unequal cell sizes, and argues that the way cells divide {{is driven by the}} shape of the dividing structure (and not vice versa).|$|E
5|$|As Mulder {{arrives in}} the fields, he {{inadvertently}} drives over a patch of mushrooms which releases a cloud of hallucinogenic spores. Mulder—unbeknownst to the viewer—begins to hallucinate. He soon discovers Wallace and Angela in a cave, and the two claim they were abducted by aliens, who covered up their disappearance with false skeletons. Later, Scully arrives at Mulder's apartment and he explains to Scully what happened. <b>He</b> <b>shows</b> her an alien that he captured at Brown Mountain. Scully, however, accepts his reasoning without question and Mulder begins to doubt his surroundings. Eventually, after seeing the yellow substance, much like Angela saw, Mulder awakens in the cave he followed Wallace into earlier, covered in the yellow secretion, being digested alive.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>showed</b> her the {{headlines}} {{of the newspaper}} he was carrying.|$|R
60|$|This time Mr. Wentworth was surprised--genuinely so, and <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> it.|$|R
50|$|<b>He</b> <b>showed</b> {{himself an}} unfaithful husband, cheated {{frequently}} on his wife.|$|R
5|$|As the Griffin family {{attend the}} county fair, Stewie announces {{that he has}} bred a winning {{pedigree}} pig for the local Quahog Clam Day. Revealing to Brian that he got the pig from a parallel universe, <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> him a remote control that allows access to the various parallel universes. Each universe depicts Quahog {{in the same time}} and place but under different conditions. Deciding to test the device, they both visit a universe where Christianity never existed (despite the existence of the Sistine Chapel in that universe), leading an impressed Brian to ask whether the remote can take them to other alternative realities. Stewie guides them both through several more parallel universes, about half of which have their own portrayals of the Griffin family. As time passes, Brian begins to lose his amazement for the device and eventually comes to realize that Stewie has no idea how to return home.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not particularly interested in hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E
5|$|Fàbregas {{was linked}} with a {{move away from}} the London after he was an unused {{substitution}} in the 2016–17 Premier League opener against West Ham. On 20 August 2016, Fàbregas once again started on the bench against Watford, entering the match in the second half to replace Nemanja Matić and creating an assist for Diego Costa, who scored the winner in a 2–1 victory. In the post-match press conference, Fàbregas earned the praise of manager, Conte, for his inspiring performance in the comeback win as well as the attitude <b>he</b> <b>shows</b> during training sessions. Fàbregas's first two goals of the season came in an EFL Cup tie against Leicester City on 20 September, both coming within two minutes of each other in extra time to win the game 4–2, the victory moving Chelsea on to the Round of 16.|$|E
50|$|Euler's work {{in number}} theory {{included}} many results about primes. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> the infinite series 1/2 + 1/3 + 1/5 + 1/7 + 1/11 + … is divergent.In 1747 <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> that the even perfect numbers are precisely the integers {{of the form}} 2p−1(2p − 1), where the second factor is a Mersenne prime.|$|R
60|$|So saying, <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> {{the whale}} tooth he had {{received}} from Erirola.|$|R
60|$|Nasmyth {{was startled}} and <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> it, but {{afterward}} he looked thoughtful.|$|R
