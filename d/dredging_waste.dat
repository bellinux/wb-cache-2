40|$|Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs), the {{information}} tools that summarise data on complex environmental issues to show overall status and trends, {{are becoming increasingly}} significant as port authorities come under more pressure to demonstrate compliance with legislation and to justify their credentials or licence to operate. Environmental Performance Indicators can be particularly useful both to the authority and {{to a wide range}} of stakeholders in providing evidence of progress and the achievement of environmental objectives. In addition, the use of effective EPIs may contribute to cost and risk reduction, review of the effectiveness of an authority’s Environmental Management System, and act as an early warning system. The thesis identifies a comprehensive inventory of existing Environmental Performance Indicators in use in the seaport sector for monitoring performance of operational (e. g. dust, noise, <b>dredging,</b> <b>waste),</b> managerial (e. g. certification, compliance, complaints) and environmental condition (e. g. air, water, soil, sediment and ecosystems). Specific examples are given of practicable, informative, and representative indicators of portspecific issues. These indicators have been filtered against specific criteria and have been assessed and evaluated by port stakeholders in order to obtain a final set of indicators suitable to be implemented at EU level. A user friendly tool has been developed specifically to assist port authorities in calculating and reporting the proposed indicators. European port authorities were encouraged to adopt this tool as a part of their environmental management and to provide data on their environmental performance. The results confirm the general feasibility and acceptability of the proposed indicators and provide a benchmark performance of the European port sector. The thesis demonstrates that a culture of monitoring and reporting environmental indicators is in place and the sector could readily be encouraged to populate the proposed European Port Observatory with meaningful EPI data...|$|E

40|$|Since {{contaminated}} river-bed sediments in Haiphong Harbor (Vietnam) {{are regularly}} dredged and disposed on land, an {{understanding about the}} influences of key parameters such as pH and oxidation on the leachability of As, Cu, Pb and Zn is necessary for management and treatment of these <b>dredged</b> <b>wastes.</b> A 96 h pHstat-leaching test examining the leaching behaviors of elements at pre-set pH values (2, 4, 6, 8 (natural), 9 and 11), is performed on a freshly-collected wet sediment and a 2 month-ripened dry sediment. Additionally, a BCR 3 - step extraction {{is also used to}} clarify the differences in leachability between 2 types of sediment. The results indicate that the pH-dependent leaching behavior reflects a concave curve with the lowest value at pHs 6 or 8 and the highest value at pH 2 in case of Cu, Pb and Zn, or at pH 11 in case of As. Generally, due to oxidation, the leachability of As and Zn has decreased considerably at highly-acid and highly-alkaline pHs (2 – 4 and 9 – 11) while, for Cu and Pb, it has increased at acid pHs (2 – 6), but decreased at highly-alkaline pHs (9 – 11). As shown by results of BCR 3 -step extraction, for As and Zn,there is a transfer from easily-soluble exchangeable & carbonate fraction to hardly-soluble reducible fraction through oxidation. As a consequence, the smaller exchangeable & carbonate fraction in the oxidized sediment is the cause for the lower leachability of As and Zn at almost all pH values. In contrast, for Cu and Pb, there is a transfer from the oxidizable fraction to the reducible fraction. Therefore, the more important reducible fraction in the oxidized sediment contributes to the higher leachability of Cu and Pb at acid pHs (2 – 4) while the smaller oxidizable fraction contributes to their lower leachability at alkaline pHs (9 – 11) if compared with the fresh sediment. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The harbour {{land fill}} in Halmstad has been {{described}} in the news {{as one of the}} most polluted areas in Halland County based on the a survey from the Swedish environmental protection agency. In order to identify the extent and severity of the situation several environmental investigations have been performed in this area. This report is based on available data from investigations and environmental reports from WSP, Höganäs AB, HEM and Halmstad municipality. This investigation focus on an “Area C” within the land fill where the main land fill material is i. a. slag from a steel work, construction <b>waste,</b> <b>dredge</b> spoil, <b>waste</b> from glass production and a casting shop. Of these material the focus have been on the metal rich slag from the steel work and its possible environmental impact. The environmental exposure of Hg, Pb, Cd, Cr, Zn, Ni, Mo and V have been calculated as an annual load from Area C. Unfortunately the data available for this investigation has not been complete, e. g. slag concentration data with corresponding leachate data was only obtained for one year. The groundwater data and land fill metal concentrations have been measured only once. This made it impossible to investigate e. g. annual variations like ageing effects of the material or weather variations, variation in the properties of the deposed slag material and statistical significance in differences could not be calculated. Further characterisation of the land fill would be worthwhile in order to be able to draw some conclusions. Calculations of the environmental load has been performed based on concentration in the slag, the land fill, the leachate data of the slag and groundwater concentrations. A model has been developed to calculate the weighted land fill metal concentration. The partitioning coefficient, Kd; between soil and liquid has been calculated and used to estimate the environmental load. It was assumed that the groundwater data was the most reliable data, which indicated that the exposure may be higher than from common soil, especially for Pb and Mo. Relating the environmental exposure values with guideline values based on MKM (less sensitive land use) -land using HQ (hazard quotient) indicates a decreasing risk in the order Pb>V>Mo. However, the exposure is well below that from MKM soil which could be assumed, according to Swedish environmental protection agency guideline values, to be an acceptable exposure...|$|R
40|$|Although human-modified {{habitats}} often {{result in}} a loss of biodiversity, some have been found to serve as habitat refuges for threatened species. Given the globally declining status of amphibians, understanding why some species are found in heavily modified environments is of considerable interest. We used the endangered green and golden bell frog (Litoria aurea) as a model to investigate the factors influencing their distribution toward industrial areas within a landscape. The number of permanent waterbodies within a kilometer of surveyed sites was the best predictor of L. aurea occupancy, abundance and reproduction. It appears that industrial activities, such as <b>dredging</b> and <b>waste</b> disposal inadvertently created refuge habitat for L. aurea to fortuitously persist in a heavily modified landscape. Future conservation plans should mimic the positive effects of industrialization, such as increasing the number of permanent waterbodies, especially in areas containing ephemeral or isolated waterbodies and threatened with drought. Our findings also suggest that despite amphibians being relatively small animals, some species may require a larger landscape than anticipated. Recognizing life history traits, in combination with a landscape-based approach toward species with perceived limited motility, may result in more successful conservation outcomes. Identifying why threatened species persist in heavily disturbed landscapes, such as industrial sites, can provide direction toward future conservation efforts to prevent and reverse their decline...|$|R

The hydration kinetics, products and microstructure are studied to explain changes in cement properties such as compressive strength development and workability. The flash-calcined dredging sediments show clear pozzolanic activity which surpasses that of typical coal combustion siliceous fly ash (V, EN 197 - 1). This is manifested in (1) the rate of compressive strength development, (2) reduced portlandite and (3) increased ettringite and bound water contents.

Over 14 × 106 m 3 of sewage sludge, <b>dredge</b> spoils, acid <b>wastes,</b> and cellar dirt are discharged into this area each year. Large populations of Bacillus sp. resistant to 20 μg of mercury per ml were observed in Bight sediments contaminated by these wastes. Resistant Bacillus populations were much greater in sediments containing high concentrations of Hg and other heavy metals than in sediments from areas further offshore where dumping has never been practiced and where heavy-metal concentrations were found to be low. Ampicillin resistance due mainly to β-lactamase production was significantly (P < 0. 001) more frequent in Bacillus strains from sediments near the sewage sludge dump site than in similar Bacillus populations from control sediments. Bacillus strains with combined ampicillin and Hg resistances were almost six times as frequent at the sludge dump site as in control sediments. This observation suggests that genes for Hg resistance and β-lactamase production are simultaneously selected for in Bacillus and that heavy-metal contamination of an ecosystem can result in a selection pressure for antibiotic resistance in bacteria in that system.

Characterization of bottom deposits {{is an important factor}} in the study of water quality because they are responsible for transporting a significant proportion of many contaminants, particularly nutrients. They also mediate their uptake, storage, release and transfer between environmental compartments. Most sediment in surface waters derives from surface erosion and comprises a mineral component, arising from the erosion of bedrock, and an organic component arising during soil-forming processes. An additional organic component may be added by biological activity within the water body. Sediment quality also nearly always complicates sediment management. Enormous volumes of sediments have to be dredged worldwide for both maintenance and also environmental reasons.

The results of chemical analyses confirmed the literary information that the concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in chosen sediment samples is diverse due to irregular sediment deposition in the reservoir and increases with proportion of the finest particle fraction.

Dredging activities to extend, deepen and maintain access to harbours generate significant volumes of <b>waste</b> <b>dredged</b> material. Some ways are investigated to add value to these sediments. One solution described here is their use in road construction following treatment with hydraulic binders. This paper presents the characterisation of four sediments, in their raw state and after 90 days of curing following stabilisation treatment with lime and cement, {{using a combination of}} novel and established analytical techniques to investigate subsequent changes in mineralogy. These sediments are classified as fine, moderately to highly organic and highly plastic and their behaviour is linked to the presence of smectite clays. The main minerals found in the sediments using X-rays diffraction (XRD) and automated mineralogy are quartz, calcite, feldspars, aluminium silicates, pyrite and halite. Stabilisation was found to improve the mechanical performances of all the sediments. The formation of cementitious hydrates was not specifically detected using automated mineralogy or XRD. However, a decrease in the percentage volume of aluminium silicates and aluminium-iron silicates and an increase of the percentage volume of feldspars and carbonates was observed.

40|$|Dredging is the {{operation}} of removing material {{from one part of}} the water environment and relocating it to another, with the general purpose of offshore construction, maintenance of waterways and reclamation. The large amount of dislodged materials known as dredged soils, are generally considered a waste and dumped into open sea, causing environmental concerns. On the other hand, steel slag is an industrial waste resulting from the process of steelmaking, destined for disposal in landfills too. As such, this study is about the mixing of a dredged marine soil with activated steel slag, with the aim of determining the effectiveness of the slag in solidifying the soil. The dredged soil was collected from Melaka waters, categorized as a high plasticity silt (MH), with natural moisture content 130. 7 %, specific gravity 2. 53, liquid limit 66 % and plastic limit 51. 6 %. The steel slag was first ground to particles smaller than 2 mm for mixing with the soil. It was activated with a range of different molarity NaOH, with only the optimum molarity resulting in maximum improvement of the soil being used throughout the study. 3 predetermined ratios of clay: activated steel slag were examined, i. e. 3 : 7, 5 : 5 and 7 : 3, and the soil-slag specimens were left to cure up to a month. The specimens were subjected to the unconfined compressive strength (UCS), vane shear and bender element tests at the respective ages. It was found that greater strength and stiffness improvement were produced by higher steel slag content and longer curing periods. The steel slag addition also helped reduce moisture in the originally wet soil. Overall it can be concluded that activated steel slag from Malaysian steel-making industry can be potentially used to solidify the otherwise <b>waste</b> <b>dredged</b> marine soils for reuse as a sound geomaterial...|$|R
40|$|Coastal {{areas are}} {{home to more than}} half of the world's {{population}} and many of its most populated urban areas. Coastal urbanism remains very much in demand despite major risk factors such as sea level rise, longterm shoreline erosion, storm surges, land liquefaction, and subsidence. City-building on reclaimed land is an ambitious form of development yet prevalent around the world, especially where an economic growth agenda is pursued aggressively against the availability of land resources. This thesis develops a critical design agenda to respond to how pro-growth forces and environmental change can be negotiated towards a reconsidered coastal urbanism. The thesis argument is that coastal urban and territorial form should not follow a static master plan based on a risk model; instead, it should employ/follow a dynamic gradient of permanence and ephemerality in multiple time scales, following coastal succession as a design analogy. Tokyo Bay is the site of experimentation. The world's largest metropolitan area has a long history of land reclamation debates and projects, which resulted in a highly articulated urban coast with reclaimed shorelines, and near- and off-shore artificial islands with a mix of uses. The on-going construction of the urban archipelago is an outcome of urban and regional metabolisms, where incinerated solid <b>waste,</b> <b>dredged</b> sediment, excavated soil, and demolished buildings are deposited to make new land. Demand for post-industrial urban development and land reclamation is still alive in coastal Tokyo despite the vulnerabilities of flooding and seismic events. Large waterfront sites are now available for new development. The construction of permanent and temporary facilities in Tokyo Bay for the 2020 Summer Olympics offers an opportunity to develop a succession- based design strategy-not only for the 2020 peak condition, but also in anticipation of future transformations. The design exploration establishes, via strategic cartography, a resiliency district framework based on a gradient of permanence and flexibility in the ground condition. The sharply delineated boundary between land and sea is rethought as a dynamic frontier zone of flexibility that adapts to flooding and sea level rise and as an active site for coastal deposition and submersion. A second, elevated ground level is proposed to serve as a pedestrian and emergency thoroughfare, as well as an extension of transportation and logistics infrastructure. The Metabolist imaginary envisioned Tokyo Bay as a site of continuous urban growth towards a mega-scale climax state; ground was taken for granted and the possibilities of urban decline or reconstruction were hardly considered within the same design utopia. This project argues for a New Metabolism in which the ground is conceived as an indeterminate landscape of change. The uncertainties of the ground are addressed by an 'artificial land' infrastructure which organizes and facilitates transformation over time. by Caner Oktem. Thesis: S.
