40|$|Construction of {{a second}} theater {{underground}} at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis required a quiet, non-intrusive means of rock removal, capable of cutting the vertical walls of the theater down {{to a depth of}} 4. 5 meters, within a vertical accuracy of 2. 5 cm. A low pressure (35 MPa) abrasive laden waterjet was developed for this; and, also modified as an abrasive waterjet drill to emplace 25 mm diameter resin-bonded rock bolts in the rock walls. The main volume of the rock within the room was concurrently excavated using a method known as CUSP, where the rock is drilled to a depth of 70 cm, split using a DARDA rock splitter, and the resulting crack grown out to delineate 400 kg blocks using a 7. 5 kw <b>impact</b> <b>breaker</b> attached to 743 series Bobcat. This system proved effective in breaking out blocks in rock ranging from plain dolomite to layers which included beds of chert several inches thick. Production rates within the room were constrained by the limited space available, but exceeded 5 cub [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} part of {{the construction}} of a second theater in the underground museum complex, below the Gateway Arch in St Louis. Given the needs for relatively quiet, non-intrusive rock removal, and yet precise cutting within the museum complex a method of using low pressure (35 MPa) abrasive laden waterjets was developed for cutting the vertical walls of the theater down to a depth of 4. 5 m., within an accuracy of 5 cm. (2 cm. was sustained in most cases). In order to emplace 2. 5 cm diameter resinbonded rock bolts an abrasive waterjet drill was also developed and field tested. The main volume of the rock within the room was concurrently excavated using a method known as CUSP, where the rock is drilled to a depth of 0. 6 m., split using a DARDA rock splitter, and the resulting crack grown out to delineate 450 kg. blocks using an 7. 5 kw <b>impact</b> <b>breaker</b> attached to 743 series Bobcat.

In this work we focus on two specific 5 -amino acids long β-sheet breakers, namely the LPFFD Soto peptide, already known in the literature, and the LPFFN peptide recently designed and studied by our team. We provide evidence that both β-sheet breakers are effective in reducing the Aβ(1 − 40) aggregation propensity, even in the presence of metal ions...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{contribution}} of SF 6 losses {{to the impact of}} high-voltage SF 6 circuit breakers on global warming is evaluated. Two air-insulated circuit breakers and two gas-insulated circuit breakers are studied over 20 years. SF 6 losses due to leakage in service, plus losses during manufacturing and commissioning, are taken into account. For these circuit breakers, it can be seen in this study that SF 6 losses due to leakage in service or during manufacture and commissioning are not the major contribution of circuit breakers to global warming. In fact, reducing the SF 6 emissions of these circuit breakers may focus on the reduction of losses occurring during maintenance. It may be possible to reduce the global <b>impact</b> of circuit <b>breakers</b> on global warming by reducing energy losses during the life of the apparatus...|$|R
40|$|Following the October 1987 {{stock market}} collapse, {{interest}} in the effect and <b>impact</b> of circuit <b>breakers</b> on market volatility has grown among practitioners, academics and regulators. Circuit breakers are market tools designed to control prices from falling in times of panic selling by providing a short cooling-down period to prevent non- rational overreaction and avoid stock market crashes. They have been recommended as a mechanism to stabilize trading activities and to reduce stock market volatility. Hence, many stock markets have adopted circuit breakers to temporarily control trading after large and rapid price changes. Although many research papers investigate the issue of circuit <b>breakers,</b> the critical <b>impact</b> of circuit <b>breakers</b> on the operation of markets is still uncertain whether in academia or industry. Studies that support the implementation of circuit breakers point out their importance in managing settlement risk and reducing volatility by giving traders some time to think rationally during times of panic trading. On the other side, opponents argue that circuit breakers increase volatility and interfere with trading, liquidity and price discovery. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to give an empirical examination of the effect of one type of circuit breaker rules - price limits - on the daily stock return volatility in Amman Stock Exchange(ASE). Whether price limits reduce or increase the stock price volatility is a question that has long attracted research interest. By comparing the volatility level in the ASE market before and after the price limit hit days, the study will show the effectiveness of adopting the price limit rule. This study will investigate the behavior of stock price volatility around the price limit hit for a sample of 25 Securities listed in Amman Stock Exchange in both the first and second markets representing different sectors for the period between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2006. Overall, the study arrives at the result of price limits effectively reducing stock market volatility by acting as a market stabilizer and providing a time out for investors to think rationally with less emotion during times of panic trading...|$|R
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} breaker for construction machinery generally {{used for the}} destroying and disassembling of buildings, crashing road pavement, breaking rocks at quarry and so on. So the measurement of the impact energy of a {{hydraulic breaker}} is very important thing to prove its capability to manufacturers and customers. In this study, the test system for measuring the impact energy of a hydraulic breaker was designed and constructed. The test system was consisted with hydraulic cylinders for mounting a <b>breaker,</b> <b>impact</b> absorbing base and frames, pressure and flow sensors, high speed and accurate data acquisition system, diesel engine driven hydraulic power pack and etc. The test process of the developed system was carried by measuring guide for tool energy rating for hydraulic breakers which {{was developed by the}} CIMA (Construction Industry Manufacturers Association) USA. The developed test system can be applied to measure the impact energy for various kind of hydraulic breakers...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is demonstrated}} {{to exploit the}} polarization sensitivity of high-resolution radar measurements to interpret and quantify upper ocean dynamics. This study particularly illustrates the potential of quad-polarization synthetic aperture radar (SAR) measurements. The analysis relies on essential characteristics of the electromagnetic scattering mechanisms and hydrodynamical principles. As the relaxation scale of centimeter-scale ocean surface scatters is typically small, radar signal anomalies associated with surface manifestations of the upper ocean dynamics on spatial scales exceeding 100 m are mostly dominated by nonresonant and nonpolarized scatters. These “scalar” contributions can thus efficiently trace local breaking and near-breaking areas, caused by surface current variations. Using dual copolarized measurements, the polarized Bragg-type radar scattering is isolated by considering the difference (PD) between vertically and horizontally polarized radar signals. The nonpolarized (NP) contribution associated with wave breaking is then deduced, using the measured polarization ratio (PR) between polarized signals. Considering SAR scenes depicting various surface manifestations of the upper ocean dynamics (internal waves, mesoscale surface current features, and SST front), the proposed methodology and set of decompositions (PD, PR, and NP) efficiently enable the discrimination between surface manifestation of upper ocean dynamics and wind field variability. Applied to quad-polarized SAR images, such decompositions further provide unique opportunities to more directly assess the cross-polarized (CP for HV or VH) signal sensitivity to surface roughness changes. As demonstrated, such an analysis unambiguously demonstrates and quantitatively evaluates the relative <b>impact</b> of <b>breakers</b> on cross-polarized signals under low to moderate wind conditions...|$|R
40|$|Price {{limits are}} {{actively}} employed by many futures exchanges as a regulatory mechanism directed at reducing volatility and improving price discovery process. The {{aim of this}} paper is to investigate whether price limits achieve these goals without affecting market liquidity for a number of agricultural futures contracts. We employ models of changing volatility in order to show that price limits do not appear to significantly reduce market volatility. In addition, we find evidence confirming the hypothesis that price limits delay price discovery instead of facilitating it. Our results also suggest that the impact of price limits on volatility and price reversals, found in previous studies, are mainly due to the properties inherent to the futures returns, such as volatility clustering. Finally, although trading decreases significantly due to the price limits, traders do not seem to switch from the contracts affected by price limits to other maturities in order to minimize the <b>impact</b> of circuit <b>breakers...</b>|$|R
40|$|Wave surfing is {{existing}} and becoming more attractive in the Netherlands. However natural wave conditions are not suited {{to encourage the}} sport. To improve the surf conditions of the local waves, Artificial Surf Reefs are potential solutions. As a part of intentions to optimise the design of Artificial Surf Reefs, this thesis is aimed at gaining insight into the wave-induced circulations and the wave-current interactions around an artificial reef. Impacts of the channel width on these processes were assessed by varying {{the width of the}} channel. Several surf-ability parameters were measured or observed to verify the performance of the proposed design. The surface currents {{on either side of the}} reef show a decrease in intensities and dimensions resulting in less intense wave-current interactions around the structure. It was found that rip currents with a Froude number smaller than 0. 1 do not cause negative <b>impact</b> on the <b>breaker</b> shapes. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In this paper, several {{numerical}} {{aspects of}} an existing model for fully nonlinear waves are improved and validated to study ware breaking due to shoaling over a gentle plane slope and wave breaking induced by a moving lateral boundary. The model is based on fully nonlinear potential flow theory and combines a higher-order Boundary Element Method (BEM) for solving Laplace's equation {{at a given time}} and Lagrangian Taylor expansions for the time updating of the free surface position and potential. An improved numerical treatment of the boundary conditions at the intersection between moving lateral boundaries and the free surface (corner) is implemented and tested in the model, and the free surface interpolation method is also improved to better model highly curved regions of the free surface that occur in breaking waves. Finally, a node regridding technique is introduced to improve the resolution of the solution dose to moving boundaries and in breaker jets. Examples are presented for solitary wave propagation, shoaling, and breaking over a 1 : 35 slope and for wave breaking induced by a moving vertical boundary. Using the new methods, both resolution and extent of computations are significantly improved compared to the earlier model, for similar computational efforts. In all cases computations can be carried out up to <b>impact</b> of the <b>breaker</b> jets on the free surface. ...|$|R
40|$|Objectives To {{determine}} the extent of hand transmitted vibration exposure problems, particularly hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS), among construction workers in Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on a construction site in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 243 workers were recruited. Questionnaire interviews and hand examinations were administered to 194 respondents. Vibration magnitudes for concrete breakers, drills and grinders were measured using a 3 -axis accelerometer. Clinical outcomes were compared and analysed according to vibration exposure status. Results Vibration total values for concrete <b>breakers,</b> <b>impact</b> drills and grinders were 10. 02 ms(- 2), 7. 72 ms(- 2) and 5. 29 ms(- 2), respectively. The mean 8 h time-weighted hand transmitted vibration exposure, A(8), among subjects on current and previous construction sites was 7. 52 (SD 2. 68) ms(- 2) and 9. 21 (SD 2. 48) ms(- 2), respectively. Finger tingling, finger numbness, musculoskeletal problems of the neck, finger coldness, abnormal Phalen's test and abnormal light touch sensation were significantly more common in the high vibration exposure group (n= 139) than the low-moderate vibration exposure group (n= 54). Mean total lifetime vibration dose among exposed subjects was 15. 2 (SD 3. 2) m(2) h(3) s(- 4) (In scale). HAVS prevalence was 18 and the prevalence ratio of stage 1 and higher disease in the high vibration exposure group versus the low-moderate vibration exposure group was 4. 86 (95 CI 1. 19 to 19. 80). Conclusions Hand transmitted vibration is a recognisable problem in tropical countries including Malaysia. The current study has identified clinical symptoms and signs suggesting HAVS among construction workers exposed to hand transmitted vibration in a warm environment...|$|R
40|$|The dynamic {{response}} of a vertical breakwater to breaking waves {{has been studied}} by the authors with prototype tests on two breakwaters in Genoa Voltri and one in Brindisi. The tests were interpreted by Mass Spring Dash-pot elements connected among {{them in order to}} represent the Array structure typical of a breakwater (MSDA model). The model is similar to the classical MSD one, except that it also considers the force exchanged by adjacent caissons through the foundation. The objective of this note is to present an analysis of the caisson interaction and to study and compare the different responses to <b>breaker</b> <b>impacts</b> on average European and Japanese caisson breakwaters. These represent typical section shapes using two areas with scaling rules relating caisson dimensions to the incident design significant wave height. Inertia, foundation stiffness and added masses are quite different for the two types of structures and their effect is analyzed. The dynamic response is presented in terms of a static equivalent response factor given {{as a function of the}} ratio between impact load duration and the main structure oscillation period, of the ratio between caisson length and width and of the fraction of the total mass represented by foundation added mass (the latter being the essential difference between European and Japanese design). Although the modeling of the array structure is essential to interpret the oscillations measured in the prototype, and is obviously important to study the effects of a load that varies along the breakwater, the prediction of the classical approach is similar in terms of maximum load on the foundations whenever the applied forcing is longitudinally homogeneous...|$|R
