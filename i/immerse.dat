30|$|In China, {{research}} on <b>immersed</b> tube tunnels started late but {{progress has been}} rapid. Research on an <b>immersed</b> tube tunnel was conducted in Shanghai in the early 1960 s, and an underwater sewage tunnel was built in 1976 [63]. Research was also conducted in Guangzhou on <b>immersed</b> tube tunnels in 1974 [63]; the road tunnel crossing Victoria harbor was built in Hong Kong in 1972, and the Gaoxiong <b>immersed</b> tube tunnel was built in Taiwan in 1984 [63]. The Guangzhou Zhujiang tunnel, built in 1993, was the first underwater tunnel for a city road and railway using the <b>immersed</b> tube method in China, and set a precedent for large <b>immersed</b> tube tunnels [64]. The second <b>immersed</b> tube tunnel was built in Ningbo Yongjiang in 1995, a project that overcame the disadvantages of a soft soil foundation and used the piecewise connection of precast method [65]. The Ningbo Changhong tunnel, built in 2002, used pile foundations required by the special geological hydrology conditions, providing insights on <b>immersed</b> tube tunnel construction in soft soil [66]. The successful construction of the Shanghai outside ring tunnel took <b>immersed</b> tube tunnel construction technology {{to a new level}} [67]. The <b>immersed</b> tube tunnel of the Hongkong–Zhuhai–Macao bridge project has a length of 6.753  km, and is the longest <b>immersed</b> tube tunnel in the world. This tunnel adopts sectional tubes of long lengths, buried under deep water, with a soft and uneven soil foundation [68].|$|R

5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually {{linked to the}} periods he spent living in different places across Europe. He was inclined to <b>immerse</b> himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E
5|$|When first {{introduced}} {{to the rest of}} the pride, the cubs initially lack confidence when confronted with adult lions other than their mother. They soon begin to <b>immerse</b> themselves in the pride life, however, playing among themselves or attempting to initiate play with the adults. Lionesses with cubs of their own are more likely to be tolerant of another lioness's cubs than lionesses without cubs. The tolerance of the male lions toward the cubs varies – sometimes, a male will patiently let the cubs play with his tail or his mane, whereas another may snarl and bat the cubs away.|$|E
5|$|Chronologically, it is {{difficult}} to establish guidelines that illustrate the evolution of Gaudí's style faithfully. Although he moved on from his initially historicist approach to <b>immerse</b> himself completely in the modernista movement which arose so vigorously in the last third of the 19th century in Catalonia, before finally attaining his personal, organic style, this process did not consist of clearly defined stages with obvious boundaries: rather, at every stage there are reflections of all the earlier ones, as he gradually assimilated and surpassed them. Among the best descriptions of Gaudí's work was made by his disciple and biographer Joan Bergós, according to plastic and structural criteria. Bergós establishes five periods in Gaudí's productions: preliminary period, mudéjar-morisco (Moorish/mudéjar art), emulated Gothic, naturalist and expressionist, and organic synthesis.|$|E

40|$|A novel <b>immersed</b> {{boundary}} {{method for}} three-dimensional, time-dependent flows {{is presented in}} this work and applied to simulating the behaviour of an individual fibre in various flow regimes. The fibre is placed in a periodic box and has either a fixed position or is allowed to move freely (including translation and rotation) through the domain. The <b>immersed</b> boundary method mirrors the velocity field along the normal of the local triangulated <b>immersed</b> boundary segment to guarantee that the fluid {{takes into account the}} <b>immersed</b> body accurately. As a result of the procedure, there is a fictitious velocity field inside the <b>immersed</b> boundary, mirroring the boundary layer. Care is taken to solve the velocity field {{in such a way that}} the mass is conserved in the cells containing the <b>immersed</b> boundary. The method applied is second-order accurate and is intended to be used for fully resolving the flow field around arbitrary moving bodies <b>immersed</b> in a fluid. The <b>immersed</b> boundary method is employed on a selection of different fibre shapes, aiming at predicting the behaviour of real fibres in realistic flow situations. The force exerted by the fluid is directly calculated by integrating the pressure and viscous forces over the objects <b>immersed.</b> The resulting coarse-grained drag and lift force functions can be employed in larger scale calculations of fluid-fibre flows...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>immersed</b> {{boundary}} {{method is}} a general technique for modeling elastic boundaries <b>immersed</b> within a viscous, incompressible fluid. The method {{has been applied to}} several biological and engineering systems, including large scale models of the heart and cochlea. These simulations have the potential to improve our basic understanding of the biological systems they model and aid in the development of surgical treatments and prosthetic devices. Despite the popularity of the <b>immersed</b> boundary method and the desire to scale the problems to accurately capture the details of the physical systems, parallelization for large scale distributed memory machine has proven challenging. The primary reason is a classic locality and load balance tradeoff that arises in distributing the <b>immersed</b> boundary data structure across processors. In this paper we describe a parallelized algorithm for the <b>immersed</b> boundary method that is designed for scalability on distributed memory multiprocessors and clusters of SMPs. It is implemented using the Titanium language, a Java-based high performance scientific computing. Our software package, called IB, takes advantage of the object-oriented features of Titanium to provide a framework for simulating <b>immersed</b> boundaries that separates the generic <b>immersed</b> boundary method code from the specific application features that define the <b>immersed</b> boundary structure and the forces that arise from those structures. Our results demonstrate the scalability of our design and the feasibility of large scale <b>immersed</b> boundary computations with the IB package. 1...|$|R
5|$|New to the Forza {{series is}} a feature known as Autovista. It is {{designed}} to allow players to walk around and explore inside cars. This feature allows players to view minute details such as brake pads, engine components, and interior details. The player can point at certain features, such as headlights, wheels and the engine for further information about them via audio recording. It can be controlled via Kinect or a game controller. Only 24 cars in the game support the Autovista feature, as it is primarily for sports cars, classic cars, and dream cars. The graphics used to create these cars are formed using image-based lighting which allowed the developers to create perfect reflections, and would better <b>immerse</b> {{the car in the}} environment both when racing on a track or in the garage or Top Gear studio when viewing a car.|$|E
5|$|The game's water effects {{received}} substantial upgrades {{because of}} the large role naval battles play in The Battle for Middle-earth II. The developers endeavored to make the surface of oceans and lakes look realistic by using techniques similar to those applied in films when creating computer-generated ocean water. The digital water simulates deep ocean water by reflecting its surroundings on the surface, and wave technology was used to create large waves along coastlines to <b>immerse</b> the player in the game experience. Lost towns, corals, and fish were added underwater to add to the effect. Water was chosen as the first graphical component of The Battle for Middle-earth II to take advantage of DirectX 9 programmable shaders. These additions were part of an overall Electronic Arts strategy to continue the Lord of the Rings experience that began with the trilogy film series.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{left the}} Academy in 1847 at age 16 and began {{attending}} {{classes at the}} University of Edinburgh. He {{had the opportunity to}} attend the University of Cambridge, but decided, after his first term, to complete the full course of his undergraduate studies at Edinburgh. The academic staff of Edinburgh University included some highly regarded names; his first year tutors included Sir William Hamilton, who lectured him on logic and metaphysics, Philip Kelland on mathematics, and James Forbes on natural philosophy. He did not find his classes at Edinburgh University very demanding, and was therefore able to <b>immerse</b> himself in private study during free time at the university and particularly when back home at Glenlair. There he would experiment with improvised chemical, electric, and magnetic apparatus, but his chief concerns regarded the properties of polarised light. He constructed shaped blocks of gelatine, subjected them to various stresses, and with a pair of polarising prisms given to him by William Nicol, viewed the coloured fringes that had developed within the jelly. Through this practice he discovered photoelasticity, which is a means of determining the stress distribution within physical structures.|$|E

In the IBM, the necessity of an accurate interpolation scheme satisfying the no-slip condition on the <b>immersed</b> boundary is important because the grid lines generally do not coincide with the <b>immersed</b> boundary.

5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully <b>immerse</b> the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken that sticks and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
5|$|Setting out {{to write}} {{something}} on an epic scale, Martin projected to write three books of 800 manuscript pages {{in the very early}} stages of the series. His original 1990s contract specified one-year deadlines for his previous literary works, but Martin only realized later that his new books were longer and hence required more writing time. In 2000, Martin planned to take 18 months to two years for each volume and projected the last of the planned six books to be released five or six years later. However, with the Ice and Fire series evolving into the biggest and most ambitious story he has ever attempted writing, he still has two more books to write as of 2016. Martin said he needed to be in his own office in Santa Fe, New Mexico to <b>immerse</b> himself in the fictional world and write. As of 2011, Martin was still typing his fiction on a DOS computer with WordStar 4.0 software. He begins each day at 10am with rewriting and polishing the previous day's work, and may write all day or struggle to write anything. Excised material and previous old versions are saved to be possibly re-inserted at a later time.|$|E
5|$|Uncharted {{uses the}} Cell {{microprocessor}} to generate dozens of layered character animations to portray realistic expressions and fluid movements, which allow for responsive player control. The PlayStation 3's graphics processing unit, the RSX Reality Synthesizer, employed several functions to provide graphical details that helped <b>immerse</b> the player {{into the game}} world: lighting models, pixel shaders, dynamic real-time shadowing, and advanced water simulation. The new hardware allowed for processes which the team had never used in PlayStation 2 game development and required them to quickly familiarize with the new techniques; for example, parallel processing and pixel shaders. While Blu-ray afforded greater storage space, the team became concerned with running out of room several times—Uncharted used more and bigger textures than previous games, and included several languages on the disc. Gameplay elements requiring motion sensing, such as throwing grenades and walking across beams, were implemented {{to take advantage of}} the Sixaxis controller. A new PlayStation 3 controller, the DualShock 3, was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show, and featured force feedback vibration. Uncharted was also on display at the show with demonstrations that implemented limited support for vibration.|$|E
