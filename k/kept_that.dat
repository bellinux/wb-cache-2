5|$|In 1911, {{following}} the accession of George V, the florin regained the shields and sceptres design {{it had in}} the late Victorian Era, and <b>kept</b> <b>that</b> motif until 1937, when the national emblems were placed on it. The florin retained such a theme for the remainder of its run, though a new design was used from 1953, {{following the}} accession of Elizabeth II. In 1968, prior to decimalisation, the Royal Mint began striking the ten pence piece. The old two shilling piece remained in circulation until the ten pence piece was made smaller, and earlier coins, including the florin, were demonetised.|$|E

5|$|Originally, {{the story}} of a woman {{separated}} from her husband when the plane crashes was going to be used for Kate, but when Kate's role in the series changed the producers <b>kept</b> <b>that</b> story for Rose. Much of the couple's story prior to the plane crash was based on the events of Caldwell's life; she married her husband even though he was dying. Due to Caldwell and Anderson having other acting commitments, the writers found it difficult finding time when both actors could appear together in the show, resulting in neither character featuring in most of season three. Critics reacted positively to the couple, often hoping they would appear more frequently, and both actors were praised for their work.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} year, at 20years of age, Richard {{was promoted}} to the Cocoa Astros of the Florida State League in high-A minor league baseball. Richard again compiled a low hits per nine innings (H/9IP) ratio by giving up only 67hits in 109 total innings pitched. Despite his 4–11 win–loss record, Richard finished {{the season with a}} 2.39ERA and even threw a no-hitter against the Daytona Beach Dodgers. During the season, Richard was able to throw an accurate fastball which occasionally exceeded 100miles per hour, and his slider 93miles per hour, faster than those of most major-league pitchers. During the 1970–71 off-season, the Astros again promoted Richard: this time to Class-AAA baseball, one step below the major leagues, with the Oklahoma City 89ers of the now-defunct American Association. Richard wore number50 and <b>kept</b> <b>that</b> number {{for the rest of his}} minor-league and major-league career. Richard started all but one of the games he pitched that season. He pitched eight complete games and led the league with 202strikeouts in 173innings of work. He ended the season with twelvewins and sevenlosses before being called up by the Houston Astros.|$|E

The earliest settlements in the area date to the 1600s, however the earliest recorded land transfer was in 1719.
