5|$|A {{consequence}} of describing electrons as waveforms {{is that it}} is mathematically impossible to simultaneously derive the position and momentum of an electron. This became known as the <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> after the theoretical physicist Werner Heisenberg, who first described it and published it in 1927. This invalidated Bohr's model, with its neat, clearly defined circular orbits. The modern model of the atom describes the positions of electrons in an atom in terms of probabilities. An electron can potentially be found at any distance from the nucleus, but, depending on its energy level, exists more frequently in certain regions around the nucleus than others; this pattern is referred to as its atomic orbital. The orbitals {{come in a variety of}} shapes-sphere, dumbbell, torus, etc.-with the nucleus in the middle.|$|E

25|$|Scientists {{are not in}} {{agreement}} about how much energy is contained in the vacuum. Quantum mechanics requires the energy to be large as Paul Dirac claimed it is, like a sea of energy. Other scientists specializing in General Relativity require the energy to be small enough for curvature of space to agree with observed astronomy. The <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> allows the energy to be as large as needed to promote quantum actions {{for a brief moment}} of time, even if the average energy is small enough to satisfy relativity and flat space. To cope with disagreements, the vacuum energy is described as a virtual energy potential of positive and negative energy.|$|E
25|$|Zero-point {{energy is}} {{fundamentally}} {{related to the}} <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle.</b> Roughly speaking, the uncertainty principle states that complementary variables (such as a particle's position and momentum, or a field's value and derivative {{at a point in}} space) cannot simultaneously be specified precisely by any given quantum state. In particular, there cannot exist a state in which the system simply sits motionless at the bottom of its potential well: for, then, its position and momentum would both be completely determined to arbitrarily great precision. Therefore, instead, the lowest-energy state (the ground state) of the system must have a distribution in position and momentum that satisfies the uncertainty principle−−which implies its energy must be greater than the minimum of the potential well.|$|E
25|$|In 1927, Bohr drew {{attention}} to a consequence of non-separability. The evolution of the system, {{as determined by the}} Schrödinger equation, does not display particle trajectories through space–time. It is possible to extract trajectory information from such evolution, but not simultaneously to extract energy–momentum information. This incompatibility is expressed in the <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle.</b> The two kinds of information have to be extracted on different occasions, because of the non-separability of the wave function representation. In Bohr's thinking, space–time visualizability meant trajectory information. Again, in Bohr's thinking, 'causality' referred to energy–momentum transfer; in his view, lack of energy–momentum knowledge meant lack of 'causality' knowledge. Therefore Bohr thought that knowledge respectively of 'causality' and of space–time visualizability were incompatible but complementary.|$|E

25|$|In {{a highly}} publicized {{experiment}} in 2012, researchers claimed to have identified the path each particle had taken without any adverse effects {{at all on the}} interference pattern generated by the particles. In order to do this, they used a setup such that particles coming to the screen were not from a point-like source, but from a source with two intensity maxima. However, commentators such as Svensson have pointed out that there is in fact no conflict between the weak measurements performed in this variant of the double-slit experiment and the <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle.</b> Weak measurement followed by post-selection did not allow simultaneous position and momentum measurements for each individual particle, but rather allowed measurement of the average trajectory of the particles that arrived at different positions. In other words, the experimenters were creating a statistical map of the full trajectory landscape.|$|E
25|$|Zero-point energy (ZPE) {{or ground}} state energy {{is the lowest}} {{possible}} energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics, quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state due to the <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle.</b> As well as atoms and molecules, the empty space of the vacuum has these properties. According to Quantum Field Theory the universe {{can be thought of}} not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose quanta are fermions (i.e. leptons and quarks), and force fields, whose quanta are bosons (e.g. photons and gluons). All these fields have zero-point energy. These fluctuating zero-point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an aether in physics, since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However this aether cannot {{be thought of as a}} physical medium if it is to be Lorentz invariant such that there is no contradiction with Einstein's theory of special relativity.|$|E

500|$|Phase {{transition}} {{refers to}} the change of phase of a system, which is brought about by change in an external parameter such as temperature. [...] Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when {{the order of the}} system was destroyed. [...] For example, when ice melts and becomes water, the ordered crystal structure is destroyed. [...] In quantum phase transitions, [...] the temperature is set to absolute zero, and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field, [...] causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by quantum fluctuations originating from the <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle.</b> Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct ground states of the Hamiltonian. [...] Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.|$|E
500|$|Both photons and {{electrons}} create analogous interference patterns when {{passed through}} a double-slit experiment. For photons, this corresponds to the interference of a Maxwell light wave whereas, for material particles (electron), this corresponds to the interference of the Schrödinger wave equation. Although this similarity might suggest that Maxwell's equations describing the photon's electromagnetic wave are simply Schrödinger's equation for photons, most physicists do not agree. For one thing, they are mathematically different; most obviously, Schrödinger's one equation for the electron solves for a complex field, whereas Maxwell's four equations solve for real fields. More generally, the normal concept of a Schrödinger probability wave function {{cannot be applied to}} photons. As photons are massless, they cannot be localized without being destroyed; technically, photons cannot have a position eigenstate , and, thus, the normal <b>Heisenberg</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> [...] does not pertain to photons. A few substitute wave functions have been suggested for the photon, but they have not come into general use. Instead, physicists generally accept the second-quantized theory of photons described below, quantum electrodynamics, in which photons are quantized excitations of electromagnetic modes.|$|E
40|$|About {{twenty years}} ago, we {{proposed}} the mathematical formulation of <b>Heisenberg's</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle,</b> and further, {{we concluded that}} <b>Heisenberg's</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle</b> and EPR-paradox are not contradictory. This is true, however we now {{think that we should}} have argued about it under a certain firm interpretation of quantum mechanics. Recently we proposed the linguistic quantum interpretation (called quantum and classical measurement theory), which was characterized as a kind of metaphysical and linguistic turn of the Copenhagen interpretation. This turn from physics to language does not only extend quantum theory to classical systems but also yield the quantum mechanical world view (i. e., the philosophy of quantum mechanics, in other words, quantum philosophy). In fact, we can consider that traditional philosophies have progressed toward quantum philosophy. In this paper, we first review the linguistic quantum interpretation, and further, clarify the relation between EPR-paradox and <b>Heisenberg's</b> <b>uncertainty</b> <b>principle.</b> That is, the linguistic interpretation says that EPR-paradox is closely related to the fact that syllogism does not generally hold in quantum physics. This fact should be compared to the non-locality of Bell's inequality. Comment: 14 page...|$|R
