5|$|Resolving {{that they}} will never again let their <b>guard</b> <b>down,</b> the group decides {{that they will}} try to reach Fort Benning, the {{alternative}} to the CDC proposed by Shane in the prior season. As in {{the final version of the}} episode, a narration scene with Rick speaking to Morgan on the walkie-talkie was included, but was re-shot with modified dialog that served to replace the above material, allowing the premiere to begin with the group putting Atlanta behind them. Rick sports his full sheriff's wardrobe in the reshoot, whereas in the original version he is wearing the white undershirt he was wearing in the Season 1 finale.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the leaders}} of Kentucky's Confederate {{government}} had remained in Chattanooga, Tennessee, awaiting Governor Hawes' return. They finally departed on September 18, and caught up with Bragg and Smith in Lexington, Kentucky on October 2. Bragg had been disappointed {{with the number of}} soldiers volunteering for Confederate service in Kentucky; wagon loads of weapons that had been shipped to the Commonwealth to arm the expected enlistees remained unissued. Desiring to enforce the Confederate Conscription Act to boost recruitment, Bragg decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort. On October 4, 1862, Hawes was inaugurated as governor by the Confederate legislative council. In the celebratory atmosphere of the inauguration ceremony, however, the Confederate forces let their <b>guard</b> <b>down,</b> and were ambushed and forced to retreat by Buell's artillery.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and dead skin in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its <b>guard</b> <b>down,</b> it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

5|$|When the Newmans {{win their}} lawsuit, Katherine decides to help Victor get Beauty of Nature back for Victor. In May 2011, Tucker {{ends up in}} a coma after being run down by a drunken Abby and Ashley takes the blame. Tucker signed a DNR but Katherine and Ashley keep Tucker from being taken off life support and Katherine is left in charge of McCall Unlimited. Tucker's living will also reveals {{that he has a}} son who stands to inherit 20 million dollars if he is found. Meanwhile, Katherine reverses all of Tucker's most recent {{business}} decisions and he and Ashley marry when he wakes up from his coma. Though Tucker is physically recovered, he lost all of his business sense and Ashley must run the company in secret until he recovers fearing Katherine may try to take his company again. Afterward, Tucker is one of several suspects when Diane is murdered and he fires Devon Hamilton (Bryton James), from his record label. In turn Katherine launches her own record label as a subsidiary of Chancellor Industries and hires Devon to run it. Tucker teams up with Jack again to overturn the sale of Jabot and a shocked Katherine ends up in the hospital after a stroke. Tucker accidentally learns from Jill that Devon is his son, and Devon refuses to accept Tucker as his new father, and disowns Katherine for hiding the truth. Meanwhile, Devon's formerly drug addicted mother, now known as Harmony (Debbi Morgan), returns to Genoa City to explain her reasons for hiding Devon's paternity. Tucker stands in as the godfather of Moses Winters, the son of his longtime friend and confidant, Sofia Dupre (Julia Pace Mitchell). Tucker does his best to build a relationship with his son, but Devon constantly rejects him. He and Ashley later renew their vows and Devon finally lets his <b>guard</b> <b>down</b> and comes to the wedding.|$|E
5|$|In March 1622, {{governor}} of Yucatán Diego de Cardenas ordered captain Francisco de Mirones Lezcano {{to launch an}} assault upon the Itza; he set out from Yucatán with 20 Spanish soldiers and 80 Mayas from Yucatán. His expedition was later joined by Franciscan friar Diego Delgado. The expedition first camped at IxPimienta; in May they moved to Sakalum, southwest of Bacalar, {{where there was a}} lengthy delay while they waited for reinforcements. En route to Nojpetén, Delgado believed that the soldiers' treatment of the Maya was excessively cruel, and he left the expedition to make his own way to Nojpetén with eighty Christianised Maya from Tipuj in Belize. In the meantime the Itza had learnt of the approaching military expedition and had become hardened against further Spanish missionary attempts. When Mirones learnt of Delgado's departure, he sent 13 soldiers to persuade him to return or continue as his escort should he refuse. The soldiers caught up with him just before Tipuj, but he was determined to reach Nojpetén. From Tipuj, Delgado sent a messenger to Kan Ek', asking permission to travel to Nojpetén; the Itza king replied with a promise of safe passage for the missionary and his companions. The party was initially received in peace at the Itza capital, {{but as soon as the}} Spanish soldiers let their <b>guard</b> <b>down,</b> the Itza seized and bound the new arrivals. The soldiers were sacrificed to the Maya gods, with their hearts cut from their chests and their heads impaled on stakes around the town. After the sacrifice of the Spanish soldiers, the Itza took Delgado, cut his heart out and dismembered him; they displayed his head on a stake with the others. The fate of the leader of Delgado's Maya companions was no better. With no word from Delgado's escort, Mirones sent two Spanish soldiers with Bernardino Ek, a Maya scout, to learn their fate. When they arrived upon the shore of Lake Petén Itzá, the Itza took them across to their island capital and imprisoned them. They escaped to a canoe by the lakeshore but the two Spanish, slowed by their bonds, were soon recaptured. Ek escaped and returned to Mirones with the news.|$|E

Soon afterwards, on 27 January 1624, an Itza war party led by AjK'in P'ol caught Mirones and his soldiers off guard and unarmed in the church at Sakalum, and killed them all. Spanish reinforcements arrived too late. A number of local Maya men and women were killed by Spanish attackers, who also burned the town.|$|E

25|$|Now {{stranded}} in Roman territory, the Goths' lack of provisions {{began to take}} its toll. Aurelian, sensing his enemies' desperation, attacked them with {{the full force of}} his cavalry, killing many and driving the remainder westward into Thrace. As winter set in, the Goths retreated into the Haemus Mountains, only to find themselves trapped and surrounded. The harsh conditions now exacerbated their shortage of food. However, the Romans underestimated the Goths and let their <b>guard</b> <b>down,</b> allowing the enemy to break through their lines and escape. Apparently emperor Claudius ignored advice, perhaps from Aurelian, and withheld the cavalry and sent in only the infantry to stop their break-out.|$|E
25|$|The Mongols very {{commonly}} {{practiced the}} feigned retreat, {{perhaps the most}} difficult battlefield tactic to execute. This is because a feigned rout amongst untrained troops can often turn into a real rout if an enemy presses into it. Pretending disarray and defeat {{in the heat of}} the battle, the Mongols would suddenly appear panicked and turn and run, only to pivot when the enemy was drawn out, destroying them at their leisure. As this tactic became better known to the enemy, the Mongols would extend their feigned retreats for days or weeks, to falsely convince the chasers that they were defeated, only to charge back once the enemy again had its <b>guard</b> <b>down</b> or withdrew to join its main formation.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in {{the rest}} of Oostergo and in Westergo {{resistance}} against the Hollanders flared up in many places.

But the matter did not end with a few violent incidents. Around the middle of June there was open insurrection in the area surrounding the city of Leeuwarden, the capital of Oostergo, and in the area directly inland from Staveren. From there it spread like an oil spill over the rest of Oostergo and Westergo.|$|E

25|$|Despite the {{dramatic}} {{ways in which}} they attain food and interact with raptors of their own and other species, the daily life of golden eagles is often rather uneventful. In Idaho, adult male golden eagles were observed to sit awake on a perch for an average of 78% of daylight, whereas adult females sat on nest or perched for an average of 85% of the day. During the peak of summer in Utah, hunting and territorial flights occurred mostly between 9:00 and 11:00 am and 4:00 and 6:00 pm, with the remaining 15 or so hours of daylight spent perching or resting. When conditions are heavily anticyclonic, there is less soaring during the day. During winter in Scotland, golden eagles soar frequently in order to scan the environment for carrion. In the more wooded environments of Norway during autumn and winter, much less aerial activity is reported, since the eagles tend to avoid detection by actively contour-hunting rather than looking for carrion. Golden eagles are believed to sleep through much of the night. Although usually highly solitary outside of the bond between breeding pairs, exceptionally cold weather in winter may cause eagles to put their usual <b>guard</b> <b>down</b> and perch together. The largest known congregation of golden eagles was observed on an extremely cold winter’s night in eastern Idaho when 124 individuals were observed perched closely along a line of 85 power poles.|$|E

500|$|Bragg, {{desiring}} {{to enforce}} the Confederate Conscription Act in the Commonwealth, decided to install the provisional government in the recently captured state capital of Frankfort.
