25|$|The master {{constraint}} programme {{has evolved}} into a fully combinatorial treatment of gravity known as Algebraic Quantum Gravity (AQG). The non-graph changing master constraint operator is adapted in the framework of algebraic quantum gravity. While AQG is inspired by LQG, it differs drastically from it because in AQG there is fundamentally no topology or differential structure – it is background independent in a more generalized sense and could possibly <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about topology change. In this new formulation of quantum gravity AQG semiclassical states always control the fluctuations of all present degrees of freedom. This makes the AQG semiclassical analysis superior over that of LQG, and {{progress has been made in}} establishing it has the correct semiclassical limit and providing contact with familiar low energy physics.|$|E

[...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E

He was invited by the president of the students' debating society, who said [...] "We believe that the only way to get the truth of what the BNP are saying and to combat them is to do it in public in a debate." [...] The move was attacked by anti-racist groups, some of whom refused to participate in the discussion. [...] Griffin said [...] "I am coming up because I was invited by the students at the university because they have a debate on an intelligent subject on which I <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> The people against it are the usual bunch of people who cannot win the argument and refuse to stand on a platform."

Waters told the Associated Press that The Wall Tour will likely be his last, stating: [...] "I'm not as young as I used to be. I'm not like B.B. King, or Muddy Waters.

Nas worked with several musicians, including Amy Winehouse, Mary J. Blige, James Poyser, Anthony Hamilton, Miguel, Large Professor, and Hal Ritson, among others. For the album, Nas wanted the production to complement his lyrics' nostalgic themes with 1980s hip hop influences. He primarily worked with hip hop producers No I.D. and Salaam Remi, a frequent collaborator of Nas. Remi said that he wanted his production [...] "to be something that a mumble-mouth rapper can’t rap on. You better <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and be speaking up." [...] Along with producer Swizz Beatz, No I.D. and Nas related to the latter's lyrics concerning divorce during the recording sessions.

Poppy wants Darren to own up straight away, because {{she feels that}} if he doesn't, she'll be lying to Jodie as well". He explained, [...] "Poppy doesn't want to see Jodie in pain, but she can't keep the secret".

2500|$|Plays {{within this}} group are absurd {{in that they}} focus not on logical acts, {{realistic}} occurrences, or traditional character development; they, instead, focus on human beings trapped in an incomprehensible world subject to any occurrence, no matter how illogical. [...] The theme of incomprehensibility is coupled with the inadequacy of language to form meaningful human connections. According to Martin Esslin, Absurdism is [...] "the inevitable devaluation of ideals, purity, and purpose" [...] Absurdist drama asks its viewer to [...] "draw his own conclusions, make his own errors". Though Theatre of the Absurd {{may be seen as}} nonsense, they <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> and can be understood". Esslin makes a distinction between the dictionary definition of absurd ("out of harmony" [...] in the musical sense) and drama's understanding of the Absurd: [...] "Absurd is that which is devoid of purpose... Cut off from his religious, metaphysical, and transcendental roots, man is lost; all his actions become senseless, absurd, useless".|$|E

And they lost out because one guy in the bungalow didn't get his work done right. Well, you can pretty well guess they're gonna <b>have</b> <b>something</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about that.

2500|$|In {{terms of}} Web 2.0's social impact, critics such as Andrew Keen argue that Web 2.0 {{has created a}} cult of digital narcissism and amateurism, which {{undermines}} the notion of expertise by allowing anybody, anywhere to share and place undue value upon their own opinions about any subject and post any kind of content, regardless of their actual talent, knowledge, credentials, biases or possible hidden agendas. Keen's 2007 book, Cult of the Amateur, argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, Sunday Times reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as [...] "creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels... mistakes, half truths and misunderstandings". In a 1994 Wired interview, Steve Jobs, forecasting the future development of the web for personal publishing, said [...] "The Web is great because that person can't foist anything on you - {{you have to go}} get it.
