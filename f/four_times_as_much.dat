By the early 1960s, the Giants were receiving $175,000 a game under the NFL's television contract with CBS — <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> as small-market Green Bay, {{which was one}} of the most successful teams of the era.

40|$|This study {{presents}} the first climatology of so-called warm conveyor belts (WCBs), strongly ascending moist airstreams in extratropical cyclones that, {{on the time}} scale of 2 days, rise from the boundary layer to the upper troposphere. The climatology was constructed by using 15 yr (1979 – 93) of reanalysis data and calculating 355 million trajectories starting daily from a 18 3 18 global grid at 500 m above ground level (AGL). WCBs were defined as those trajectories that, {{during a period of}} 2 days, traveled northeastward and ascended by at least 60 % of the zonally and climatologically averaged tropopause height. The mean specific humidity at WCB starting points in different regions varies from 7 to 12 g kg 21. This moisture is almost entirely precipitated out, leading to an increase of potential temperature of 15 – 22 K along a WCB trajectory. Over the course of 3 days, a WCB trajectory produces, on average, about <b>four</b> (six) <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> precipitation <b>as</b> a global (extratropical) average trajectory starting from 500 m AGL.

A discounted cash flow analysis demonstrates that, by developing a 50 -year uranium reserve instead of a commercial plutonium and breeder program, Japan could save up to $ 22. 7 billion.

In addition, lysozyme induced {{a large portion}} of the endospore inoculum to revert to the mycelial growth phase. Increasing lysozyme concentrations to 10 or 20 μg/ml prompted a nearly complete reversion of the inoculum to the mycelial phase. Mature endosporulating spherules removed from growth medium and resuspended in a solution of human or HEW lysozyme at 18 μg/ml in distilled water prompted leakage of <b>four</b> to five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> of materials absorbing maximally at 260 nm into the supernatant as untreated control spherules during 90 min of incubation.

40|$|Twenty {{naturally}} occurring strains of Bradyrhizobium japonicum in 11 serogroups were screened for {{the ability to}} take up Mo as bacteroids from soybean root nodules. The strains varied greatly in their ability to take up Mo in a 1 -min period. The best strain was USDA 136, which had an Mo uptake activity of almost 3. 0 pmol/min per mg of bacteroid (dry weight). In contrast, the poorest strain, USDA 62, had an Mo uptake activity of 0. 35 pmol of Mo per min per mg of bacteroid. There were similarities in Mo uptake ability among most of the same serogroup members. The variability in Mo uptake rates between the best (USDA 136 and USDA 122) and poorest (USDA 62 and USDA 140) strains was attributed to their differing affinities for Mo. Double-reciprocal plots of velocity versus substrate indicated a Km for USDA 136 and USDA 122 of 0. 045 and 0. 054 microM, respectively, whereas strains USDA 62 and USDA 140 both exhibited an apparent Km for MoO 42 - of about 0. 36 microM. The two strains with the higher-affinity Mo binding also accumulated <b>four</b> to five <b>times</b> <b>as</b> <b>much</b> Mo over a 30 -min period as the other strains. Soybeans were grown in Mo-deficient and Mo-supplemented conditions after inoculation with the three top-ranking Mo uptake strains and the three poorest Mo uptake strains.

Strain USDA 62 nodule N 2 fixation responded positively to Mo supplementation in one of the two experiments.

The increase in weight of the filter paper was taken {{as a measure of}} sweating {{rate and the}} distilled water eluate from the filter paper was analysed for sodium and potassium. Animals were exposed for 4 h to air temperatures of 20 - 45 °C at 30 % r. h. and for 5 - 7 h to air temperatures of 40 and 45 °C at 40 % r. h. Estimated sweating rates were low by comparison with previously reported values, probably due to rising levels of humidity under the polythene disks during exposure to the skin. B. indicus cross-bred cows had higher sweating rates than B. taurus cows at high air temperatures but the difference between the groups was not significant statistically. Sweating rates were generally highest on the shoulder and lowest on the lumbar region. The amounts of sodium and potassium recovered from filter papers were small and very variable at low air temperatures but increased significantly with air temperature (P < 0. 01). No significant differences in the amounts of electrolyte recovered from filter papers were recorded between the species groups or between different sites of collection.

Then I followed it to the sorting tables and saw the men deftly and swiftly spread it out and brush it about and seize the diamonds as they showed up. I assisted, and once I found a diamond half as large as an almond. It is an exciting kind of fishing, and you feel a fine thrill of pleasure every time you detect the glow of one of those limpid pebbles through the veil of dark sand. I would like to spend my Saturday holidays in that charming sport every now and then. Of course there are disappointments. Sometimes you find a diamond which is not a diamond; it is only a quartz crystal or some such worthless thing. The expert can generally distinguish it from the precious stone which it is counterfeiting; but if he is in doubt he lays it on a flatiron and hits it with a sledgehammer. If it is a diamond it holds its own; if it is anything else, it is reduced to powder. I liked that experiment very much, and did not tire of repetitions of it. It was full of enjoyable apprehensions, unmarred by any personal sense of risk.
