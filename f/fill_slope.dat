40|$|Rainfall is {{the most}} {{important}} cause of slope failure. The variation in stress state of soils due to rise of groundwater level and seepage of groundwater is critical to the deformation and failure of slopes during and after heavy rainfall. The stability of <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> depends not only on the strength of fill material but also the drainage condition of the slope. Proper drainage control can not only limit the height of groundwater level, but also dissipate the build-up of excess pore pressure caused by shearing-induced contraction of soil. The possibility of liquefaction and flow failure of <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> can be reduced consequently. The performance of compacted <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> during rise of groundwater level is investigated by using a fully coupled procedure and the state-dependent dilatancy sand model. The interaction between pore water and soil skeleton including both buoyancy and seepage effects can be precisely taken into account in a fully coupled effective stress approach. The influence of the drainage condition of compacted fill on the stability of slope is examined. The analytical result indicates that the drainage condition in a compacted <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> {{plays an important role in}} controlling the deformation of slope during and after heavy rainfall. Proper drainage control must be provided in remediation of loose fill slopes...|$|E
40|$|Finite {{difference}} {{analyses were}} conducted to explore the possible behaviour of soil nails in loose fill slopes which were formed by strain-softening materials. Numerical models simulating a 20 m high 35 degrees loose <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> were set up. With the use of an undrained strain-softening soil model, the behaviour of a loose <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> reinforced with soil nails subjected to rainfall infiltration was studied. Results indicated that soil nails together with a proper facing structure may reduce the deformation of a loose <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> caused by rainfall infiltration and hence maintain the stability of the slope. Tensile forces in the soil nails were mobilised through the effective connections between the facing structure and the nail heads when a potential slide was being initiated. Through this mechanism, the development of a flow slide at shallow depths could be avoided by the pull out resistance between the soil and the nails at deeper locations of the slope. Results also showed that, if the soil nails were not connected to a facing structure or nail heads at the slope surface, a global failure mechanism involving the development of a flow slide could be observed, which was similar to that of a loose <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> without soil nails.

40|$|Graduation date: 1968 The catchment-filter, {{soil erosion}} gage, macroprofile, and spike and washer {{techniques}} for erosion measurement were compared on six plots along a newly constructed logging {{road in the}} Oregon Coast Range {{during the winter of}} 1965 - 66. Three plots were located on a cut slope; three plots were on a <b>fill</b> <b>slope.</b> Erosion occurred uniformly over each plot.

The data indicate that the soil erosion gage and macroprofile techniques may have application in studying the erosion process, but should not be used to measure amounts of erosion. In this study the spike and washer technique recorded deposition while the other techniques indicated erosion. The techniques were not affected by differences between the two slopes. The steep cut slope eroded three times as much as the gentler <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> during the study period. From limited data frost appeared to have an influence on erosion from steep cut slopes.

40|$|We {{show that}} the {{distance}} between a finite <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> and a reducible <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> on the boundary of a hyperbolic knot manifold is at most one. Let M be a knot manifold, i. e. a connected, compact, orientable 3 -manifold whose boundary is a torus. A knot manifold {{is said to be}} hyperbolic if its interior admits a complete hyperbolic metric of finite volume. Let M(α) denote the manifold obtained by Dehn <b>filling</b> M with <b>slope</b> α and let ∆(α,β) denote the distance between two slopes α and β on ∂M. When M is hyperbolic but M(α) isn’t, we call the corresponding <b>filling</b> (<b>slope)</b> an exceptional <b>filling</b> (<b>slope).</b> Perelman’s recent proof of Thurston’s geometrisation conjecture implies that a filling is exceptional if and only if it is either reducible, toroidal, or Seifert fibred. These include all manifolds whose fundamental groups are either cyclic, finite, or very small (i. e. contain no non-abelian free subgroup). Sharp upper bounds on the distance between exceptional <b>filling</b> <b>slopes</b> of various types have been established in many cases, including: • ∆(α,β) ≤ 1 if both α and β are reducible <b>filling</b> <b>slopes</b> [GL 2] • ∆(α,β) ≤ 1 if both α and β are cyclic <b>filling</b> <b>slopes</b> [CGLS] • ∆(α,β) ≤ 1 if α is a cyclic <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> and β is a reducible <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> [BZ 2] • ∆(α,β) ≤ 2 if α is a cyclic <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> and β is a finite <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> [BZ 1] • ∆(α,β) ≤ 2 if α is a reducible <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> and β is a very small <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> [BCSZ 2] • ∆(α,β) ≤ 3 if both α and β are finite <b>filling</b> <b>slopes</b> [BZ 3] • ∆(α,β) ≤ 3 if α is a reducible <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> and β is a toroidal <b>filling</b> <b>slope</b> [Wu] [Oh] • ∆(α,β) ≤ 8 if both α and β are toroidal <b>filling</b> <b>slopes</b> [Go...|$|R

Surface erosion, surface infiltration and movement of ground water are possible triggering mechanisms of failure in loose <b>filled</b> <b>slope.</b> The variation in stress state of soil due to the rise of ground water level and seepage of ground water is critical to the deformation and failure of slope during and after heavy rainfall. The deformation of slope caused by change of ground water level was investigated by adopting a fully coupled procedure and the state-dependent dilatant sand model. The effect of the rise of ground water level was simulated by increasing the mass density of pore water in the soil elements between the initial and targeted ground water levels.

40|$|The {{application}} of Rubbersoil-Primer to <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> protection against rainfall infiltration was first initiated in 2004. The engineering properties of Rubbersoil-SB, Rubbersoil-LGM and Rubbersoil-Primer were studied {{by the former}} researcher and the capability of Rubbersoils in protecting loose fill slopes were justified by the rainfall model test and a full scale field test in Sau Kei Wan. This thesis serves as a continuation to investigate the function of Rubbersoil-Primer as an interface material for controlling the hydraulic conditions of loose fill slopes and the engineering properties of a new Rubbersoil [...] Rubbersoil-Impermeable Primer were investigated in this thesis. The mechanical and hydraulic properties of Rubbersoil-Primer and Rubbersoil-Impermeable Primer ranging from unconfined compressive strength, saturated and unsaturated permeability, soil water characteristics to confined and unconfined shrinkage were studied {{by a series of}} laboratory tests. The performances of Rubbersoil <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> under hypothetical and real rainfall condition were examined by the rainfall model test, numerical simulation and a full scale field test in Tuen Mun. In {{light of the fact that}} the soil-water characteristic (SWCC) measures the water storage capacity of the soil under a given soil suction and it is an essential hydraulic parameter for computing transient seepage in unsaturated soils, an indirect and a direct test making use of MIP (mercury intrusion porosiometry) and modified pressure plate were conducted to determine the SWCC of Rubbersoil-Primer of various densities. The measured SWCC together with the generated permeability functions were used as an input parameters for simulating the transient seepage analysis. Parametric study on the influences of the density and the thickness of Rubbersoil-Primer, the angle of slope inclination and the rainfall pattern on the pore water pressure distribution were performed. The numerical simulation results show that the matric suction of the loose fill soil can be maintained with the use of Rubbersoil-Primer over the density range from 1300 kg/m 3 to 1700 kg/m 3 and the pore water pressure distribution is found to be insensitive to the thickness of Rubbersoil-Primer. The numerical modeling results suggest that there is a room for reduction to the original design density and thickness of Rubbersoil-Primer.. It is also found that there is no significant change in the pore water pressure distribution with respect to the change in the <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> inclination and the matric suction of the fill soil is maintained under a 10 hour black rain event as well as a real rainfall event which triggered the 1976 Sau Mau Ping landslide. The capability of Rubbersoil-Primer in protecting <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> under rainfall infiltration was also assured by the physical rainfall model test and the full scale field test.

40|$|A plane-strain {{numerical}} {{model has been}} developed to mimic a nailed loose <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> under surcharge loading. The model {{has been used to}} back-analyse a field test that was conducted to examine the behaviour of soil nails in loose fill slopes under surcharge loading. Incremental elasto-plastic analyses coupled with pore water diffusion have been performed to study the internal deformation, water content redistribution in the soil, and the performance of the soil nails during and after the application of surcharge loading. The model parameters describing the mechanical and hydraulic properties of the nailed slope were obtained from field or laboratory tests. Different modelling techniques and boundary conditions for mimicking soil-nail interaction in loose fill material have been examined. Comparisons between numerical predictions and field measurements demonstrate that a new interfacial model, denoted as the embedded bond-slip interface model, is more suitable for mimicking the interfacial behaviour. Despite the simplicity of the {{numerical model}}, the predicted responses are in close agreement with the field test results, in particular the mobilisation and distribution of nail forces in response to surcharge loading. Both the numerical and the field test results suggest that soil nails are capable of increasing the overall stability of a loose <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> for the loading conditions considered in this study. The increase in confining stress along the soil nails near the surcharge area is central to the overall stabilising mechanism. On the contrary, the nail forces mobilised near the nail heads are much smaller, indicating that the beneficial effect of having a structural grillage system at the slope face is limited for the range of surcharge pressures considered in this study. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{principal}} {{objectives of}} this research are to investigate the triggering and failure mechanisms of static liquefaction in loose fill slopes and to study role of soil nails during slope liquefaction. This research consists of three major components, namely centrifuge modeling of static liquefaction of loose fill slopes using Leighton Buzzard (LB) sand, investigation of role of soil nails during liquefaction of loose sand fill slopes in dynamic centrifuge tests and evaluation of liquefaction potential of loose fill slopes using completely decomposed granite (CDG) in both static and dynamic centrifuge tests. In addition, preliminary numerical analyses are carried out {{to assist in the}} explanation of results obtained from the centrifuge model tests. Model slopes were formed by compacting LB sand with water content of 5 % and CDG with water content of 11 % to an initial relative compaction ranging from 65 % to 70 %. In static centrifuge tests, ground water was raised or rainfall infiltration was simulated in initially unsaturated slopes. In dynamic centrifuge tests, sand slopes were shaken after slopes had been subjected to limited shallow seepage failure and was submerged under water and CDG slopes were saturated with viscous fluid and shaken at high g. A sudden and brittle liquefied rapid flow failure was observed and recorded in a 24 ° loose sand <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> with a prototype height of 12. 9 m. This type of failure was only induced by raising the ground water table but was not triggered by rainfall infiltration. During the rapid liquefied flowslide, significant excess positive pore water pressures were measured. It was illustrated that the rapid flowslide was caused by static liquefaction of the loose sand resulting from the strain-softening of the sand under 'undrained' conditions. However, the strain-softening behaviour of loose materials was only a necessary but not sufficient condition to induce static liquefaction failure. A trigger was needed. Based on the numerical analysis, the observed fluidised rapid flowslide was triggered by the sliding of the edge of the crest, which had been induced by a seepage flow failure under 'drained' condition. During the rise of ground water, soil nails helped to reduce wetting-induced volume change in loose sand fill slopes. Shallow seepage failure was not prevented by soil nails. The 15 ° nailed slope with height of 5. 9 m was subjected to a shaking with a peak acceleration of 0. 16 g, which was 8. 8 times that applied to the unreinforced slope. A relatively shallower failure was observed in the nailed slope with the measured maximum excess pore pressure reduced by 17. 5 %, the settlement and the lateral movement of sand mass reduced by 62 % and 41 %, respectively. Soil nails were illustrated and verified to reduce volume contraction of the slope and to resist soil deformation before slope liquefaction. However, with shaking as a trigger, liquefied flowslide cannot be prevented by soil nails. Excessive settlements were measured at the 29 °, 16 m high loose CDG fill slopes during rise of ground water. Surface erosion was induced by heavy rainfall. No flowslide and liquefied flowslide was triggered under both static and dynamic conditions since CDG had a much lower liquefaction potential as compared with that of LB sand. This is consistent with the findings from a 33 °, 4. 5 m high loose CDG <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> subjected to rise of ground water table and rainfall infiltration in the field. It is very unlikely, if not possible to induce liquefied flowslide in loose CDG <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> but shallow non-liquefied flowslide is possible...|$|E

40|$|Chronic {{instability}} of existing railroad track substructures and embankments cause track deflections that require frequent maintenance, slow orders, and overall inefficiency of railroad operations. Substructure instability {{can be caused}} weak subgrade soils, poor-quality ballast, or inadequate thickness of the ballast and subballast layers. Typical problems that develop are subgrade shear failure, ballast pocket formation, and fouled ballast. As these problems develop, drainage becomes inhibited {{and the presence of}} water accelerates the problem. Slope instability problems that affect rail operations include embankment <b>fill</b> <b>slope</b> failures and landslides in natural slopes. Water, or water pressure, is often the primary cause of these types of instability. Trench drains are simple ballast-filled excavations that provide an effective means of draining water from the track substructure, embankment slopes and landslide areas.

They provide several advantages over other stabilization methods currently in use. They are simple to understand, economical to construct, and have proven effective on thousands of sites around the country...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Let M be {{a simple}} 3 -manifold with a toral {{boundary}} component. It is known that if two Dehn fillings on M along the boundary produce re-ducible manifolds, then {{the distance between the}} <b>filling</b> <b>slopes</b> is at most one. This paper gives a remarkably short proof of this result by using x-faces. 1...|$|R
