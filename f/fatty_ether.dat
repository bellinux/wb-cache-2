40|$|Synopsis [...] Specific {{combinations}} of the polyoxyethylene <b>fatty</b> <b>ethers</b> and <b>fatty</b> alcohols or acids exhibit considerable pearlescence or iridescence in aqueous or aqueous aerosol systems. As {{a result of}} the high aesthetic appeal of these systems, they should be useful for the for-mulation of cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. The pearlescence that is produced depends upon the particular polyoxyethylene <b>fatty</b> <b>ethers,</b> <b>fatty</b> alcohols, and fatty acids that are present, and also upon their concentrations and ratios to each other. The pearlescence is sensitive to temperature, and all of the products ultinmtely lose their pearlescence at higher temperatures. The loss of pearlescence occurs over a temperature range rather than at a specific temperature. This behavior in conjunc-tion with the optical properties of these systems, indicates that they belong to the class of substances having mesomorphic or liquid crystalline structures. Acrosols prepared from the aqueous concentrates generally discharge as foamy liquids which subsequently expand into foams. The propellant can affect the pearlescence of the aqueous concentrates, particularly if the molecular complex has some affinity for the pro-pellant...|$|R

Surfactant molecules would interact with SF molecules, resulting in lower critical micelle concentration (CMC).

The mean flux rate of the depression was 53. 2 ± &# 61472; 8. 7 mg CH 4 m- 2 d- 1, whereas the mean flux rate of the dryer rim part of the polygon was 4. 7 ± 2. 5 CH 4 m- 2 d- 1. The quantity of dissolved organic matter (DOM), which represents an important C pool for microbial communities, correlated significant with the total concentrations of phospholipid <b>fatty</b> acids and <b>ether</b> lipids (PLFA and PLEL) a measure for microbial biomass. Although permafrost soils represent a large carbon pool, it was shown, that the reduced quality of organic matter leads to a substrate limitation of the microbial metabolism. This is an important finding for modelling and calculating trace gas fluxes from permafrost environments, because the known models are consider only the total carbon amount. It can be concluded by the presented results firstly that microbial communities in permafrost environments are composed by members of all three domains of life at numbers comparable to temperate soil ecosystems and secondly that the permafrost microorganisms are well adapted to the extreme temperature gradient of their environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{biodegradation}} of <b>fatty</b> alcohol polyglycol <b>ethers</b> was {{studied by}} analyzing the 14 C-labeled intermediates isolated from the effluent of a model continuous-flow sewage treatment plant after dosage of either alkyl- or heptaglycol-labeled stearyl alcohol ethoxylate (SA- 7 EO). In each case, uncharged and carboxylated (mainly dicarboxylated) polyethylene glycols constituted the most prominent metabolites. The results indicate {{that there is a}} faster degradation of the alkyl than the polyethylene glycol moiety and that there are two distinct primary degradation mechanisms acting simultaneously in microbial biocenoses: intramolecular scission of the surfactant as well as omega- and beta-oxidation of the alkyl chain. Characterization of the bulk of 14 C-labeled metabolites as a homologous series of neutral and acidic polyglycol units and identification of several C 2 -fragments accounted for the depolymerization of the hydrophilic part of the surfactant by stepwise cleavage of ether-bound EO units; from additional degradation studies employing either neutral or carboxylated 14 C-labeled polyethylene glycols as model metabolites, it was concluded that hydrolytic as well as oxidative cleavage of C 2 -units is involved. Most of the identified low-molecular-weight 14 C-labeled acids suggest an ultimate degradation of EO monomers by the oxidative dicarbonic acid cycle or the glycerate pathway or both. In addition, the finding of considerable amounts of oxalic and formic acids allow consideration of an additional mineralization route via glyoxylic, oxalic, and formic acids. The simultaneous action of different degradation mechanisms indicates the involvement of several distinct bacterial groups in the biodegradation of fatty alcohol ethoxylates under environmental conditions...|$|R
40|$|An ecotechnological {{approach}} to control crayfish (Procambarus clarkii) infestation in rice {{fields of the}} Lower Mondego River Valley (Central Portugal) has recently been investigated. The application of the biodegradable non-ionic surfactant Genapol OXD- 080, a <b>fatty</b> alcohol polyglycol <b>ether,</b> in rice paddies at a given concentration (50 mg/l) has been considered as a non-harmful chemical method to mitigate damage caused by crayfish digging activities to rice crops. Therefore, an important requirement regarding the ecological viability {{of this approach is}} that populations of non-target species are not significantly affected. A simple mosquitofish (Gambusia holbrooki) population model, in which the relationships with its main food prey were considered, was developed to assess the potential risk to a non-target key species of contaminating the irrigation channels following surfactant application. The model is based on data concerning mosquitofish life cycle and population dynamics, as well as mosquitofish diet and interactions with its main prey species. Quantitative information regarding the acute and sublethal effects of Genapol OXD- 080 on mosquitofish and other non-target organisms was obtained from laboratory experiments. Three concentrations of Genapol OXD- 080 (0. 75, 1 and 2. 5 mg/l) were used to simulate a small amount of contamination in irrigation channels. If contamination occurred, the mosquitofish population would tend to decline dramatically, even when submitted to a very small concentration of Genapol OXD- 080 (e. g. 0. 75 mg/l, 66. 7 times lower than the concentration planned to be used in rice paddies). Thus, Genapol OXD- 080 could potentially cause vast damage to local mosquitofish populations, and therefore should not be used without taking all precautions to avoid contaminating important biological reservoirs, such as the rice field irrigation channels.

40|$|Processed {{foods are}} {{recognized}} {{as a source of}} fat (namely saturated and trans fats), salt and sugar. A high intake of processed foods has been related with an increased risk for the presence of several chronic diseases, such as, obesity, hypertension, stroke, diabetes, cancer. In the last years, the diversity of this type of foods in the global market has increased, due to consumer convenience and demand. This study brings an overview of the current salt and fat (including fatty acids profile) contents of Portuguese processed foods. Between 2013 and 2016, 263 different foods were acquired in food chains and restaurants from Portugal. Charpentier-Volhard’s method was used to evaluate the salt content in the selected samples. Total fat content was determined by acid hydrolysis followed by Soxhlet extraction with petroleum <b>ether.</b> <b>Fatty</b> acids profile was evaluated by gas chromatography coupled to flame ionization detection. The selected foods were distributed into 9 categories (cookies and biscuits, bakery products, cereals products, snacks, nuts and oilseeds, potato products, sauces, fast-food, and ready-to-eat meals). The highest mean values for salt were obtained in sauces, followed by cereals products and fast-food, with 1. 96, 1. 91 and 1. 42 g/ 100 g, respectively. Concerning total fat 56 % of the analysed food categories had contents higher than 20 g/ 100 g. Most of the analysed foods had a low trans fatty acids (TFA) content, confirming that food industry have developed efforts to decrease the levels of TFA in this type of foods. However, it is necessary to take actions to reduce the salt content of processed foods, since some categories still have high values and can represent a health concern.

40|$|PhDThis thesis {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} studies on surfactant adsorption at different interfaces. Particularly, this dissertation focuses on adsorption processes occurring at buried interfaces (solid-liquid and liquid-liquid). Because of complexity in the sample environment, the study of buried interfaces is experimentally challenging. Neutron reflectivity enables the study of adsorption processes at interfaces at atomic length scale. Furthermore, neutrons can be transmitted through solid substrates, permitting the analysis of buried interfaces. The technique was used to describe adsorption processes both qualitatively and quantitatively, delivering information regarding structure of adsorbed layers and adsorbed amount. Different investigations were carried out during the PhD and the results are grouped into two main sections. Investigations at the solid-liquid interface are presented in the first section. Chapter 3 provides an example of structural study of complex multi-layers at the silicon-water interface; a surfactant adsorption study at the technologically relevant metal-oil interface is presented in Chapter 4. The second section discusses a series of neutron reflectivity experiments at the important oil-water interface. The structural study of a series of non-ionic dodecanol ethoxylate surfactants is discussed in Chapter 6. The structure of a lipid monolayer as model for a biological membrane is reported in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 is a comparative study of <b>fatty</b> acid-alkylated azacrown <b>ether</b> co-adsorption at the air-water and oil-water interface. These mixtures are used for metal ion extraction processes. This was the first analysis of a surfactant mixture at the oil-water interface using neutron reflectivity. Some of the studies reported here are the first of their kind and the advances affect different technologically and biologically relevant areas. As a result of this PhD project a number of follow-up studies have been planned and several neutron reflectivity experiments will be performed in the future to further explore these interesting areas of science...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. September 2015. Major: Food Science. Advisor: Roger Ruan. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); ix, 41 pages. Structural analysis of phosphatidylcholine (PC) {{plays an important}} role in omega- 3 fatty acids enriched products assessment, developing structured omega- 3 fatty acids– containing PC, metabolic processes studies and diseases diagnosis. In this thesis, a new positional analysis of PC is described. Its methodology is based on a smart connection between two-dimensional chromatography and in-situ enzymatic hydrolysis. Most characterizations of PC composition happened on a thin layer chromatography (TLC) plate. Firstly, PC was isolated from total lipids by TLC and its purity was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Without further extraction from the TLC plate, PC was hydrolyzed by phospholipases on the plate directly. The key step of the in-situ enzymatic reaction was to promote interactions between PC and phospholipases, because this in-situ enzymatic hydrolysis occurred on a silica gel matrix. These increases can be accomplished via adding a wetting agent consisting of chloroform/ methanol/ water (65 : 24 : 4, v/v/v) onto the reaction area. Free fatty acids (FFAs) released from different positions of PC were then isolated from products mixture by second-dimensional chromatography and were chemically transesterified into <b>fatty</b> acids methyl <b>ethers</b> (FAME). With help of gas chromatography- flame ionization detector (GC-FID), the presented method could reveal relative percentage of each fatty acid on sn- 1 and sn- 2 positions of PC with 91. 59 % and 84. 80 % accuracies, respectively. Therefore, separation of PC from total lipids, enzymatic conversion of PC to FFAs and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), and separation of FFAs from products mixture can be performed on one TLC plate. This will remove the need to extract the separated PC from the TLC plate for the enzymatic reaction, avoid the risk of losing materials during the extraction processes; saving time, labor and cost...|$|R

MethodsThe volatile oils of all plants were extracted by hydrodistillation method and analyzed by GC/MS method. The lipid constituents of plants were obtained by extraction with petroleum ether and fractionated into fatty alcohols, fatty acids and unsapoinfiable matters. Antibacterial activity of T. zanonii extracts and antioxidant activity of different extracts of T. zanonii were also studied. ResultsThe volate oil of B. andreuzziana was found to consists of 20 compounds in which caryophyllin is the main one (63. 1 %), the volatile oil of T. zanonii consists of 74 compounds in which germacrene-D was the main compound, while the volatile oil of V. tenuisecta consists of 13 compounds with 1 -octen- 3 -ol as a major constituent (52. 87 %). The study of antimicrobial activity of different extracts of V. tenuisecta showed that, both methanol and butanol extracts exhibited the highest activity against Mycobactirium phlei (M. phlei) and Candida albicans (C. albicans) respectively, while petroleum <b>ether,</b> <b>fatty</b> alcohols and unsaponifiable fractions had no antimicrobial activity against all the tested microorganisms. Investigation of the antioxidant activity of different extracts of T. zanonii using DPPH method proved that, the ethyl acetate and butanol fractions showed the highest activity where the inhibition percentage (I%) are 93. 6 and 92. 1 respectively. ConclusionsThis is the first report about the volatile oils of these plants where T. zanonii have the highest content and {{the highest number of}} the identified compounds. The study of antioxidant T. zanonii extracts proved that, the ethyl acetate, butanol and aqueous extracts have the highest antioxidant activity.

40|$|Fatty alcohol {{derivatives}} {{are used}} as surfactants and applied in commercial formulations like laundry detergents, cleaning agents or cosmetic products as complex mixtures. Different classes of surfactants are combined in formulations to improve {{the properties of the}} product such as cleaning capacity or foam formation. Furthermore, the individual surfactant classes already consist of a complex mixture of homologues because of the raw materials used and the production process. Due to the complexity of this kind of samples, an analytical method is necessary which can detect all individual substances as well as qualify and quantify them. In this work, {{it has been shown that}} complex mixtures consisting of anionic, nonionic and amphoteric surfactants can be separated with HILIC by substance class. Furthermore, a separation by EO homologues was achieved for the ethoxylated substances while a separation by alkyl chain length distribution was only obtained for the betaines. In addition, the application of a reversed phase material showed a very good separation by alkyl chain length distribution whereas the substance classes could not be separated from each other. The use of different organic mobile phases can also lead to a separation by EO homologues, if needed. But exemplified by a special phase material for the analysis of surfactants, it was shown that the onedimensional separation by substance class, alkyl chain length distribution and EO homologues of a complex surfactant mixture leads to coelutions and a very complicated data evaluation. Since the one-dimensional separation did not lead to the desired result, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography (LCxLC) was implemented. Firstly, the Neue test was carried out for a closer characterization of the reversed phase materials used. While the separation in the first dimension was performed by polar interactions of a HILIC phase, a C 8 diol phase showed the highest orthogonality when used as second dimension. With this column combination, a separation by substance class and EO homologues was achieved in the first dimension, while the separation in the second dimension led to a further separation by alkyl chain length distribution. Finally, the developed method allowed the separation of about 110 individual substances. The LCxLC method was successfully applied to the analysis of several real samples from the home care sector. Furthermore, analyses for the determination of the reproducibility of peak area and retention time showed that the reproducibility of the retention time in the first dimension is dependent on the retention time. Apart from a small sector in the chromatogram where broad signals were obtained, the reproducibility of the retention time in the first dimension resulted in values below 10 %. The retention time in the second dimension showed a very good reproducibility with a relative standard deviation below 7 % for all substances. Concerning the reproducibility of the peak area, a relative standard deviation below 7 % was achieved for fatty alcohol ethoxylates (FAEO), <b>fatty</b> alcohol <b>ether</b> sulfates (FAES) and betaines. For the fatty alcohol sulfates (FAS) and alkyl polyglucoside (AG), higher values were achieved, which is due to an insufficient and non-reproducible ionisation. Regarding the betaines and fatty alcohol ethoxylates, it was shown that a quantification of the surfactants in complex mixtures is possible with an external calibration or the standard addition method...|$|R
