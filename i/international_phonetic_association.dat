5|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association</b> organizes {{the letters}} of the IPA into three categories: pulmonic consonants, non-pulmonic consonants, and vowels.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally {{letters or}} {{diacritics}} are added, removed or modified by the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association.</b> As {{of the most}} recent change in 2005, there are 107 letters, 52 diacritics and four prosodic marks in the IPA. These are shown in the current IPA chart, posted below in this article and at the website of the IPA.|$|E
5|$|The International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) is an {{alphabetic}} {{system of}} phonetic notation {{based primarily on}} the Latin alphabet. It was devised by the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association</b> in the late 19th century as a standardized representation of the sounds of spoken language. The IPA is used by lexicographers, foreign language students and teachers, linguists, speech-language pathologists, singers, actors, constructed language creators and translators.|$|E
40|$|In this article, we {{introduce}} recently released, {{publicly available}} resources, which allow users to watch videos of hidden articulators (e. g. the tongue) during {{the production of}} various types of sounds found in the world’s languages. The articulation videos on these resources are linked to a clickable <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> Alphabet chart ([International <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association.</b> 1999. Handbook of the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> Association: A Guide to the Use of the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> Alphabet. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press]), so that the user can study the articulations {{of different types of}} speech sounds systematically. We discuss the utility of these resources for teaching the pronunciation of contrastive sounds in a foreign language that are absent in the learner’s native language...|$|R

5|$|Since its creation, the IPA has {{undergone}} a number of revisions. After major revisions and expansions in 1900 and 1932, the IPA remained unchanged until the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association</b> Kiel Convention in 1989. A minor revision took place in 1993 {{with the addition of}} four letters for mid central vowels and the removal of letters for voiceless implosives. The alphabet was last revised in May 2005 {{with the addition of a}} letter for a labiodental flap. Apart from the addition and removal of symbols, changes to the IPA have consisted largely of renaming symbols and categories and in modifying typefaces.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong first taught {{phonetics}} in 1917 in Daniel Jones's summer {{course for}} missionaries; even before then, Jones {{had planned to}} give Armstrong a full-time position at the University College Phonetics Department. Those plans were temporarily put on hold when London County Council decided against a budgetary increase for the department in October, but in November 1917, Jones nominated Armstrong to receive a temporary, part-time lectureship, which she started in February 1918. She {{was finally able to}} work full-time {{at the start of the}} 1918–1919 academic year, becoming the Phonetics Department's first full-time assistant. Armstrong became lecturer in 1920, senior lecturer in 1921, and reader in 1937. Her promotion to readership was announced in The Times and The Universities Review. Armstrong also occasionally taught at the School of Oriental Studies. When Jones had to take a leave of absence the first nine months of 1920, Armstrong became acting head of the department in his stead. During this time, she interviewed and admitted students into the department. Other positions she held at University College were Chairman of the Refectory Committee and Secretary of the Women Staff Common Room. Learned societies Armstrong belonged to included the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association,</b> the Modern Language Association, and the International Congress of Phonetic Sciences.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Extensions to the IPA", often {{abbreviated}} as [...] "extIPA" [...] {{and sometimes}} called [...] "Extended IPA", are symbols whose original {{purpose was to}} accurately transcribe disordered speech. At the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association</b> Kiel Convention in 1989, a group of linguists drew up the initial extensions, which {{were based on the}} previous work of the PRDS (Phonetic Representation of Disordered Speech) Group in the early 1980s. The extensions were first published in 1990, then modified, and published again in 1994 in the Journal of the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association,</b> when they were officially adopted by the ICPLA. While the original purpose was to transcribe disordered speech, linguists have used the extensions to designate a number of unique sounds within standard communication, such as hushing, gnashing teeth, and smacking lips. The extensions have also been used to record certain peculiarities in an individual's voice, such as nasalized voicing.|$|E

500|$|The <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association</b> had {{suspended}} {{publication of}} its journal [...] during World War I, but in 1921 it began producing a yearly publication [...] ("Texts for our students"), {{which consisted of}} texts transcribed in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) from various languages, such as English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. Armstrong contributed several transcriptions of English texts throughout its volumes.|$|E
500|$|The 1949 Principles of the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association</b> {{recommends}} using [...] (open tail g) {{for advanced}} voiced velar plosives (denoted by Latin small letter script G) and [...] (loop tail g) for regular ones {{where the two}} are contrasted, but this suggestion was never accepted by phoneticians in general, and today '' is the symbol used in the , with '' acknowledged as an acceptable variant and more often used in printed materials.|$|E

500|$|An IPA symbol {{is often}} {{distinguished}} from the sound {{it is intended to}} represent, since there is not necessarily a one-to-one correspondence between letter and sound in broad transcription, making articulatory descriptions such as 'mid front rounded vowel' or 'voiced velar stop' unreliable. While the Handbook of the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association</b> states that no official names exist for its symbols, it admits the presence of one or two common names for each. The symbols also have nonce names in the Unicode standard. In some cases, the Unicode names and the IPA names do not agree. For example, IPA calls [...] "epsilon", but Unicode calls it [...] "small letter open E".|$|E
500|$|In 1886, a {{group of}} French and British {{language}} teachers, led by the French linguist Paul Passy, formed what would {{come to be known}} from 1897 onwards as the <b>International</b> <b>Phonetic</b> <b>Association</b> (in French, [...] ). Their original alphabet was based on a spelling reform for English known as the Romic alphabet, but {{in order to make it}} usable for other languages, the values of the symbols were allowed to vary from language to language. For example, the sound [...] (the sh in shoe) was originally represented with the letter [...] in English, but with the digraph [...] in French. However, in 1888, the alphabet was revised so as to be uniform across languages, thus providing the base for all future revisions. The idea of making the IPA was first suggested by Otto Jespersen in a letter to Paul Passy. It was developed by Alexander John Ellis, Henry Sweet, Daniel Jones, and Passy.|$|E
