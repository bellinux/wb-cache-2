40|$|The {{present study}} investigates the {{functions}} of gestures in preschoolers’ <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities.</b> Specifically, utilizing McNeill’s growth point theory (1992), I examine how gestures contribute {{to the creation of}} contrast from the immediate context in the spoken discourse of children. When preschool children describe an <b>activity</b> consisting <b>of</b> multiple actions, like playing on a slide, they often begin with the central action (e. g., sliding-down) instead of with the beginning <b>of</b> the <b>activity</b> sequence (e. g., climbing-up). This study indicates that, in <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>activities,</b> gestures may be among the cues the speaker uses for forming a next idea or for repairing the temporal order <b>of</b> the <b>activities</b> described. Gestures may function for the speaker as visual feedback and contribute to the process of utterance formation and provide an index for assessing language development...|$|R

The outcome of which is a system capable of running in real-time, and generating extremely high recognition rates for large lexicons with as little as a single training instance per sign. We demonstrate classification rates as high as 92 % for a lexicon of 164 words with extremely low training requirements outperforming previous approaches where thousands of training examples are required. ...|$|R
