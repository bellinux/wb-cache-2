40|$|Abstract: Reduction {{in plastic}} {{injection}} molding cycle time and increase in part quality are two {{goals that are}} not usually thought of as being compatible. Conformal cooling channels {{are one of the}} technologies that will help achieve both goals. Cooling time is the only phase of the injection molding cycle that has significant time to reduce. Reduction in cooling time usually results in parts with hotter temperatures. This could result in increased part shrinkage and warpage. The key to cycle time reduction and better quality is to cool the parts uniformly and more quickly. This study will show that conformal cooling channels provide better cooling than standard conventional <b>cooling</b> <b>lines.</b> By designing <b>cooling</b> channels around the part’s geometry, more uniform cooling can be achieved compared to standard conventional <b>cooling</b> <b>lines.</b> Rapid tooling is the easiest and most inexpensive method to construct conformal <b>cooling</b> <b>lines</b> in mold inserts. It is important to balance mold strength with <b>cooling</b> concerns. <b>Cooling</b> <b>lines</b> in the inserts reduce the structural integrity of the inserts. Correct placement and design of the cooling channels is needed to reduce the effect of the <b>cooling</b> <b>lines</b> on the structural integrity of the inserts. Computer-Aided-Engineering tools are needed to optimize the mold inserts for cooling and strength. High Density Polyethylene and Polycarbonate were used in this study. The mold and melt temperature differences between the two materials will help to illustrate the difference between the mold materials and <b>cooling</b> <b>line</b> layouts...|$|R

Many of these issues will also apply at some level {{to the design of}} the muon cooling experiment. Although measurements of muon beams have been made for years, the high precision, high intensities, limited access, and large backgrounds associated with the cooling environment may make the required measurements of the muon beam challenging. The primary problems seem to be associated with tuning and operating of the transverse cooling sections. At the upstream end of the <b>cooling</b> <b>line,</b> the total number of secondaries produced at the target will make any measurement of muons difficult, however at the downstream end of the <b>cooling</b> <b>line,</b> once pions and other particles have decayed or been removed by collimation, solenoidal focusing, momentum cuts or absorption, measurements using standard techniques should be much easier.

40|$|Energy and {{environmental}} {{implications of a}} refrigeration cycle are largely conditioned by the choice of condensing system. Conventional solutions transfer heat to water, and recirculated through cooling towers or to atmospheric air through a dry condenser.
