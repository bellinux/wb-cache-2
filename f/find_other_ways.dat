25|$|Sex is not {{considered}} acceptable outside marriage, {{but it is an}} important part of the love and care shown between partners. Sexual relations are forbidden during the time of the woman's period. After her period has ended, she will go to the mikveh (the ritual immersion pool) where she will fully immerse herself and become ritually clean again. Sexual relations may then resume. Married couples need to <b>find</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> of expressing their love for each other during these times, and some say that the time of abstention enhances the relationship.|$|E

He {{realized}} the coming importance of the automobile, and in 1911 he campaigned for a project he called [...] "The Great White Way", a turnpike between Monte Ne and Muskogee, Oklahoma. Harvey Requested that a [...] "Good Roads" [...] meeting be held by the Commercial Club of Rogers; however, they did not feel that it was their meeting because, while fairly well attended, hardly any Rogers businessmen were present. Harvey assessed the project would cost Rogers $5,000 without their permission or consent, and this estimate was far less than what engineers advising the Rogers businessmen believed the cost would be. Ultimately the [...] "Great White Way" [...] project failed, and Harvey blamed the community of Rogers for lack of support.|$|E

500|$|Buddhists {{are not in}} {{agreement}} {{with regard to the}} interpretation, role, and importance of merit. The role of merit-making in Buddhism has been discussed throughout Buddhist history, but much more so in the last centuries. In the nineteenth century, during the rise of Buddhist modernism and the Communist regimes, Buddhists in South and Southeast Asia became more critical about merit-making when it became associated with magical practices, privileging, ritualism and waste of resources. In [...] pre-modern Thailand, {{a great deal of the}} funds of temples were derived from the profits of land that were offered to temples by royalty and nobility. During the period of religious reform and administrative centralization in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, however, Thai temples were no longer supported in this manner and had to <b>find</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> to maintain themselves.|$|E
500|$|Santaolalla {{began work}} on The Last of Us early in its development. Druckmann did not give him {{specific}} directions but offered him the game's stories and themes. Santaolalla appreciated this freedom and felt it assisted his process. He {{felt the need to}} [...] "go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic", when composing. The composer prefers to compose as he records, as he has little knowledge of reading and writing sheet music. To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments that were new to him, giving [...] "an element of danger and innocence". For some tracks, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique sounds, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen. The title track was composed on a variety of charango called a ronroco. The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical for video game action music, stating that it is [...] "relatively low-key", and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it. The game's theme, [...] "The Last of Us", was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed. With the music, the team aimed to [...] "get emotion", as opposed to [...] "horror". Inspired by the sparing use of music in the film No Country for Old Men (2007), the team used music judiciously and tried to <b>find</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> to [...] "make your palms sweaty". The orchestral portions of the score were recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville by the Nashville Scoring Orchestra.|$|E

As editor since 1986, Ian Hislop is reportedly one of the most sued people in Britain. From 1969 to the mid-1980s, the magazine was represented by human rights lawyer Geoffrey Bindman.|$|R

2500|$|Applying this standard, Marshall {{examined}} {{the same two}} justifications that the District Court confrontedchild welfare and counseling noncustodial parents about their obligations. [...] These justifications are defeated because as Marshall explained, Wisconsin could <b>find</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> to achieve the interest without resorting to infringement of a fundamental right, and that the latter reason is defective because it fails to achieve the objectives it sets out to meet (which {{is one of the}} necessities of being narrowly tailored). [...] Accordingly, Marshall affirmed the District Court by focusing the lack of connection and efficacy of the measures Wisconsin advances, rather than confronting the importance of Wisconsin's interests.|$|E

2500|$|With {{federal and}} state sources for {{redevelopment}} generally less available, local governments {{have been forced to}} <b>find</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> to subsidize improvement projects in their localities, without directly raising taxes. One of the tools many states use to take up the slack by lack of {{federal and state}} funding is Tax Increment Financing (TIF), which is a public financing method used for redevelopment and community improvement projects for more than 50 years. [...] Texas utilizes TIF by creating tax increment reinvestment zones (TIRZs) which may be initiated by the city or county or by petition of owners whose total holdings in the zone consist of a majority of the appraised property value.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2010, General Richards {{said there}} was no desire to [...] "open up another front" [...] in the Middle East but {{suggested}} that in future it [...] "might be" [...] necessary. David Cameron told Parliament that Britain would [...] "take every step to cut out the terrorist cancer that lurks in the Arabian Peninsula", but Gen Richards said an intelligence-led approach was the current strategy. Richards added: [...] "Clearly, the primary agencies dealing with this are our intelligence and security agencies. But the military are already helping with their [...] training.

2500|$|Scenes {{shot at the}} United Palace theater {{created new}} {{challenges}} for the series' stunt team due to {{not being able to}} drill holes in the historic building for creating anchors for wire rigs and other complex stunts. The crew had to <b>find</b> <b>other</b> <b>ways</b> to weigh down the equipment to remain safe for the actors and stunt doubles. For the explosion at the restaurant [...] "Genghis Connie's", a practical explosion was created in the storefront on location, which was extended with visual effects to show the destruction of the building. A set showing the inside of the rubble of the destroyed building was then created on a soundstage, while a lot was found that [...] "feels" [...] similar to the original location, where rubble could by piled and fire trucks could be brought to show the exterior. The lot was previously being used to store vehicles that had been seized as evidence, with the production having to negotiate with the NYPD to have the vehicles moved elsewhere. Looking back on the filming style of the season, and comparing it to the previous Marvel Netflix series, Weeks said,"You want it to feel like it's all in the same city, all in the same time frame, but you want each show, each character to feel a little different. Have its own visual identity. Some of that is lighting, and of course, some of that is production design and location work ... We embraced Harlem for exactly what it is. The color, the life, the activity on the streets. There's so much character to the neighborhood… I think it was important to feel that these characters were rooted in the real place". The series' production sound mixer Joshua Anderson, who worked on Daredevil and Jessica Jones as well, worked to capture as much sound on set with boom mics over lavaliers to ground the unbelievable elements of the series in [...] "naturalistic sound". He noted that Ali's Cottonmouth laugh and many of Colter's lines in particular sounded [...] "incredible on the boom". Anderson also talked about Luke Cage adding a new layer of sound that the other series did not—music. The captured sound had to be clear to be properly mixed in with music later, and live performances in Harlem's Paradise had to be recorded for which Anderson and his team had experience after working on the musical series Smash.|$|E

Some years ago, in a mine not owned by the De Beers, a black found what has been claimed to be the largest diamond known to the world's history; and, as a reward he was released from service and given a blanket, a horse, and five hundred dollars. It made him a Vanderbilt. He could buy four wives, and have money left. Four wives are an ample support for a native.
