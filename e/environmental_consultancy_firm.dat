One sector {{that seems to be}} of particular significance is the <b>environmental</b> <b>consultancy</b> industry. It assists public and private actors in developing environmental solutions and ensuring implementation and compliance by providing particular knowledge, management, and assessment skills. However, little {{attention has been paid to}} the environmental authority and agency of companies active in this field. This exploratory study on global <b>environmental</b> <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms</b> is guided by the basic research questions on agency in earth system governance: What is agency?

40|$|As {{a result}} of global dynamics—the {{increasing}} interconnection of people and places—innovations in global environmental governance haved altered the role of cities in shaping {{the future of the}} planet. This book is a timely study of the importance of these social transformations in our increasingly global and increasingly urban world. Through analysis of transnational municipal networks, such as Metropolis and the C 40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, Sofie Bouteligier's innovative study examines theories of the network society and global cities from a global ecology perspective. Through direct observation and interviews and using two types of city networks that have been treated separately in the literature, she discovers the structure and logic pertaining to office networks of environmental non-governmental organizations and <b>environmental</b> <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms.</b> In doing so she incisively demonstrates the ways in which cities fulfill the role of strategic sites of global environmental governance, concentrating knowledge, infrastructure, and institutions vital to the function of transnational actors...|$|R
40|$|The {{finding that}} – within {{the sphere of}} global {{environmental}} governance – links between cities/city networks and multilateral institutions seem to be well established, stimulated to explore what is behind this reality. This paper examines this topic in two ways: first, it looks at the role of local governments. More concretely, it examines how city networks relate to multilateral institutions like UNEP and the World Bank. Various city networks strive for recognition by and cooperation with these organizations. This should enable them to deliver their message and {{to have access to}} expertise. Based on concrete practices, the author reflects on what the inclusion of multilateral institutions in city networks adds to city networks’ functioning. Second, in line with the global cities literature, the paper investigates whether actors in global environmental governance gear their geographical presence to the locations of multilateral institutions involved in global environmental governance. It does so by discussing the location strategies of global environmental NGOs and global <b>environmental</b> <b>consultancy</b> <b>firms.</b> This should reveal whether some cities can be conceptualized as sites of influence or ‘global political cities’ for global environmental governance. The theoretical framework for this explorative discussion on cities, multilateral institutions and global environmental governance consists of publications on networks, flows and global cities (Castells, Mol, Sassen). This literature allows us to evaluate how cities’ contribution to global environmental governance might be changing because of globalization processes. status: publishe...|$|R

At the Open University of the Netherlands, the Virtual Business Learning (VBL) {{concept has}} been {{developed}} {{over a number of}} years. VBL serves as an ‘umbrella’ term that covers concepts from both the education and business worlds.

Concurrently, they have various duties with professional responsibilities, in a realistic business setting the work on authentic tasks.

Finally, the strength of the VBL concept in both implementation modi is discussed and differences are highlighted...|$|E
