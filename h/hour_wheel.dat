60|$|There {{were three}} {{books in the}} room--Jeremy Taylor's 'Holy Living and Dying,' a volume of the Quiver, and a little gilded book on wildflowers. He read in vain. He lay {{and listened to the}} uproar of his {{thoughts}} on which an occasional sound--the droning of a fly, the cry of a milkman, the noise of a passing van--obtruded from the workaday world. The pale gold sunlight edged softly over the bed. He ate up everything on his tray. He even, on the shoals of nightmare, dreamed awhile. But by and by as the <b>hours</b> <b>wheeled</b> slowly on he grew less calm, less strenuously resolved on lying there inactive. Every sparrow that twittered cried reveille through his brain. He longed with an ardour strange to his temperament to be up and doing.|$|R
50|$|An {{electric}} motor (often synchronous, if {{directly connected to}} the AC line) turns two sets of wheels continuously via a reduction gear train: the faster {{at a rate of}} 1 revolution per hour, the slower at a rate of 1 revolution per 24 <b>hours.</b> The <b>wheels</b> move continuously, not in steps.|$|R
50|$|Minute leaves 45 through 59 {{have a small}} tooth {{on their}} left edges, {{pointing}} toward the hour leaves. The purpose of this tooth is as follows: at 45 minutes after the hour, the tooth pushes a small hook that protrudes into the <b>hour</b> <b>wheel</b> area. This hook will catch any falling hour leaf (as mentioned above, it falls from its metal tab {{a few minutes before}} the hour) until it is released by the minute leaf's fall {{at the top of the}} hour.|$|E
50|$|The {{mainspring}} that powers the watch, {{a spiral}} ribbon of spring steel, is inside a cylindrical barrel, with the outer {{end of the}} mainspring attached to the barrel. The force of the mainspring turns the barrel. The barrel has gear teeth around the outside that turn the center wheel once per hour — this wheel has a shaft that goes through the dial. On the dial side the cannon pinion is attached with a friction fit (allowing it to slide when setting the hands) and the minute hand {{is attached to the}} cannon pinion. The cannon pinion drives a small 12-to-1 reduction gearing called the motion work that turns the <b>hour</b> <b>wheel</b> and hand once for every 12 revolutions of the minute hand.|$|E
5000|$|Used in watches, the keyless {{work are}} the gears that wind the {{mainspring}} when the crown is turned, {{and when the}} crown is pulled out allow the hands to be set. The term originated because, before the modern form of keyless work was invented by the French watchmaker Adrien Philippe in 1843, watches were wound and set by inserting a separate key into holes {{in the back and}} turning it. [...] The core of the keyless mechanism is a gear on the watch's winding stem, the clutch (or castle wheel in Britain), with two sets of axial gear teeth on it, which slides in and out. When the stem is pushed in, a lever slides the clutch out, and the outer set of teeth engages a small wheel train which turns the mainspring arbor, winding the mainspring. When the stem is pulled out, the clutch slides in, and the inner teeth engage another wheel, which turns the <b>hour</b> <b>wheel</b> in the motion work, turning the watch's hands.|$|E
60|$|But in the Klondike, {{such was}} its hilarious sorrow at the {{departure}} of its captain, that for twenty-four <b>hours</b> no <b>wheels</b> revolved.

60|$|Winter made a {{great change}} in the plantation, since it not only {{stripped}} the trees of their leaves but swept away all that rank herbage, the fennel included, allowing the grass to grow again. The large luxuriantly-growing annuals also disappeared from the garden and all about the house, the big four-o'clock bushes with deep red stems and wealth of crimson blossoms, and the morning-glory convolvulus with its great blue trumpets, climbing over and covering every available place with its hop-like mass of leaves and abundant blooms. My life in the plantation in winter was a constant watching for spring. May, June, and July were the leafless months, but not wholly songless. On any genial and windless day of sunshine in winter a few swallows would reappear, nobody could guess from where, to spend the bright <b>hours</b> <b>wheeling</b> like house-martins about the house, revisiting their old breeding-holes under the eaves, and uttering their lively little rippling songs, as of water running in a pebbly stream. When the sun declined they would vanish, to be seen no more until we had another perfect spring-like day.|$|R

2500|$|Jeopardy! and Wheel {{have since}} become staples on seven of ABC's eight owned-and-operated {{stations}} (WABC, KABC/Los Angeles, WLS, WPVI/Philadelphia, KGO/San Francisco, WTVD/Raleigh-Durham and KFSN/Fresno). The only exception was KTRK in Houston, {{which has never}} carried both game shows (in part due to an hour-long newscast in the Prime Time Access <b>hour</b> where <b>Wheel</b> would normally broadcast); both game shows have aired on different Houston stations: first on NBC-affiliate KPRC from their respective start dates to 1986 when both shows moved to Tegna-owned CBS affiliate KHOU.

40|$|Excavators are {{commonly}} used in forest harvesting in Brazil as an option to typical forestry harvesters, mainly because of their lower cost and also because some models are being manufactured locally, which means more units sold, facilitating dealer’s support and purchase of parts. Problems with excavators are related to high cost of tracks maintenance and difficulties to operate on steep ground terrain, when compared with wheeled harvesters. This study compared excavators, used as forestry harvesters, with wheeled harvesters to fall Eucalyptus tree plantations located on flat terrain. The productivities of both machines were quite similar, but the higher cost per effective <b>hour</b> of <b>wheeled</b> harvesters, concerned the models utilized in this study, favored the use of excavators, as base machines, to fall trees in a clear-cut system on flat terrain...|$|R

50|$|The Christie tank {{embodied}} {{the ability to}} operate both on tracks and on large, solid-rubber-tired bogie wheels. The tracks were removable to permit operation on wheels over moderate terrain. Also featured was a suspension system of independently sprung wheels. The Christie had many advantages, including the amazing ability, in 1929, to attain speeds of 69 miles per <b>hour</b> on <b>wheels</b> and 42 miles per hour on tracks, although at these speeds the tank could not carry full equipment. To the infantry and cavalry the Christie was the best answer to their need for a fast, lightweight tank, and they were enthusiastic about its convertibility. On the other hand, the Ordnance Department, while recognizing {{the usefulness of the}} Christie, was of the opinion that it was mechanically unreliable and that such dual-purpose equipment generally violated good engineering practice. The controversy over the advantages and drawbacks of Christie tanks raged for more than twenty years, with the convertible principle being abandoned in 1938. But the Christie ideas had great impact upon tank tactics and unit organization in many countries and, finally, upon the US Army as well.|$|R

50|$|Despite {{implementation}} since 1997 of {{road space}} rationing {{by the last}} digit of the plate number during rush hours every weekday, traffic in this 20-million-strong city still experiences severe congestion. According to experts, {{this is due to}} the accelerated rate of motorization occurring since 2003 and the limited capacity of public transport. In São Paulo, traffic is growing at a rate of 7.5% per year, with almost 1,000 new cars bought in the city every day. The subway has only 61 km of lines, though 35 further kilometers are under construction or planned by 2010. Every day, many citizens spend between three up to four <b>hours</b> behind the <b>wheel.</b> In order to mitigate the aggravating congestion problem, since June 30, 2008 the road space rationing program was expanded to include and restrict trucks and light commercial vehicles.|$|R
50|$|Center {{or second}} wheel - which turns once per hour. Its pinion is turned by the teeth on the {{mainspring}} barrel in watches and spring driven clocks, {{and by the}} weight pulley in weight driven clocks. Its arbor projects {{through a hole in}} the face and drives, via a friction coupling, the cannon pinion, which carries the minute hand. It also drives the pinion of the third wheel. In wrist watches with centre seconds, that is with the seconds hand pivoted coaxially with the minute and <b>hour</b> hands, this <b>wheel</b> is positioned off centre to allow the fourth wheel to be placed at the centre of the movement. In this arrangement the wheel is called the second wheel, because it is still the second wheel in the train but no longer at the centre of the movement.|$|R
25|$|Initially, Jeopardy! was relegated by {{managers}} of some television stations to unpopular time slots, {{and it was}} not unusual for both Jeopardy! and Wheel to air either non-consecutively, on different stations, or even against each other. However, the new version built upon early ratings success in Cleveland and Detroit, where it was slotted in the same 7:00–8:00p.m. period (the Prime Time access <b>hour)</b> in which <b>Wheel</b> also appeared. Coinciding with the peak of popularity for Trivial Pursuit and the installation of electronic trivia games (e.g. NTN Buzztime) in pubs and bars, Jeopardy! was slowly becoming a major success despite some markets still airing it in unfavorable time slots. One such market was New York City, the largest in the United States. There, King World sold their new show to WNBC, which had been the home of the original Jeopardy!. When it premiered in the fall of 1984, Jeopardy! initially aired at 1:30a.m. on WNBC, following Late Night with David Letterman.|$|R
50|$|Joining {{these two}} parts into an {{aircraft}} took two people {{a little over}} half an <b>hour.</b> The steering <b>wheel</b> stowed {{in the car and}} the bumper in the rear fuselage, then the car was backed into the fuselage opening and linked to the wings by attaching on each side a single lift strut to a bracket on the lower car body. This positioned the windscreen at the wing leading edge and the side windows enclosed the cabin. Entry was via standard car-type, forward hinged doors. Removing the grille revealed a propeller boss and the propeller was bolted on. The Vespa 400 had been modified so that the front wheels could be swung downward and forward on V struts, forming the Autoplanes's narrow track main undercarriage. Its rear suspension was also modified to allow the wheels to be retracted upwards into the body. After a flight, this procedure was reversed, releasing the car to the road.|$|R
40|$|One {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension, which affects approximately 30 % of astronauts after short duration shuttle missions, is inadequate norepinephrine release during upright posture. We performed a two phased {{study to determine}} the effectiveness of an alpha 1 -adrenergic agonist, midodrine, as a countermeasure to post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension. The {{first phase of the}} study examined the landing day orthostatic responses of six veteran astronauts after oral midodrine (10 mg) administered on the ground within approximately two <b>hours</b> of <b>wheel</b> stop. One female crewmember exhibited orthostatic hypotension in a previous flight but not after midodrine. Five male crewmembers, who did not exhibit orthostatic hypotension during previous flights, also did not show signs of orthostatic hypotension after midodrine. Additionally, phase one showed that midodrine did not cause hypertension in these crewmembers. In the second phase of this study, midodrine is ingested inflight (near time of ignition, TIG) and orthostatic responses are determined immediately upon landing via an 80 degree head-up tilt test performed on the crew transport vehicle (CTV). Four of ten crewmembers have completed phase two of this study. Two crewmembers completed the landing day tilt tests, while two tests were ended early due to presyncopal symptoms. All subjects had decreased landing day stroke volumes and increased heart rates compared to preflight. Midodrine appears to have increased total peripheral resistance in one crewmember who was able to complete the landing day tilt test. The effectiveness of midodrine as a countermeasure to immediate post-spaceflight orthostatic hypotension has yet to be determined; interpretation is made more difficult due to low subject number and the lack of control subjects on the CTV...|$|R
