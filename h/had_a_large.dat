40|$|Recent {{applications}} {{in the field of}} photonics require materials with <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> non-linear response to applied fields. Among the tools that can indicate which organic material <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>large</b> hyperpolarizability, there is vibrational spectroscopy. It is shown here that materials with very <b>large</b> Raman intensities <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> second hyperpolarizability accounted for in terms of relaxation mechanism; it is also suggested that doped materials, which <b>have</b> <b>an</b> anomalously <b>large</b> infrared intensity, can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>large,</b> first hyperpolarizability. Moreover, the relaxation mechanism involved in hyperpolarizabilities can be explained in terms of changes in geometries along the direction of the 'effective conjugation coordinate' R...|$|R
