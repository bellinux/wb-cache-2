5|$|Black mambas breed {{annually}} and mating {{occurs in the}} early spring, when male mambas locate a female by following her scent trail.

5|$|Launceston Castle {{played a}} role in Cornish {{politics}} <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> the 16th century.

5|$|The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued seven bulletins on the storm, {{though the}} system only briefly entered the centre's {{response}} zone before it dissipated. Due to moisture from Nicole {{combined with the}} extratropical storm, the Atlantic Storm Prediction Centre issued heavy rainfall and wind warnings for large portions of the Canadian Maritimes. The remnants of Nicole, combined with a powerful extratropical storm, produced strong winds across the Maritimes, including over 80mph (130km/h) on western Cape Breton. The strong winds uprooted trees and downed power lines, while the winds combined with rough seas cancelled ferry crossings and restricted access to the Confederation Bridge. The storm complex also dropped over 2inches (60mm) of rainfall, causing flooding in eastern Nova Scotia. The storm's passage <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> apple harvest caused troubles for Annapolis Valley.|$|E
