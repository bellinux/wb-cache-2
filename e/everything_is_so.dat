2500|$|Upon {{returning}} to Chadds Ford, he painted {{a series of}} farm scenes for Scribner's, finding the landscape less dramatic {{than that of the}} West but nonetheless a rich environment for his art: [...] "Everything lies in its subtleties, <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> gentle and simple, so unaffected." [...] His painting Mowing (1907), not done for illustration, was among his most successful images of rural life.|$|E
2500|$|Gus van Go {{was known}} for having helmed the debut album by the Stills, whom he managed and whose success felt reassuring for Priestess. Heppner told the Montreal Mirror in December 2005 that he trusted van Go's {{judgment}} and that the producer [...] "had every drum sound and guitar sound already figured out before he even pressed 'record'". The producer employed such things as shakers, tambourines, and vocal treatments, and Heppner has also stated that piano was occasionally used on the album for its [...] "percussive" [...] quality. In particular, cowbell was used on [...] "Run Home". Even though the polished sound of the record was initially welcomed by the band as being something [...] "different" [...] for a hard rock record, the result of van Go emulating the sounds of well-known older metal records, the group came to be rather dissatisfied with it over time. While initially liking the idea, Heppner later described the album as merely being twelve of their songs in recorded form, and not actually intended to represent the group's live sound; the band pride themselves on their concert performances the most. In comparison to Prior to the Fire, the next album Priestess recorded, he said Hello Master is [...] "a really weird sounding album [...] <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> tight and really produced." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jeff Koons rose to {{prominence}} in the mid-1980s {{as part of a}} generation of artists who explored the meaning of art in a media-saturated era. He gained recognition in the 1980s and subsequently set up a factory-like studio in a SoHo loft on the corner of Houston Street and Broadway in New York. It was staffed with over 30 assistants, each assigned to a different aspect of producing his workin a similar mode as Andy Warhol's Factory (notable because all of his work is produced using a method known as art fabrication). Today, he has a [...] factory near the old Hudson rail yards in Chelsea, working with 90 to 120 regular assistants. Koons developed a color-by-numbers system, so that each of his assistants could execute his canvases and sculptures {{as if they had been}} done [...] "by a single hand". [...] "I think art takes you outside yourself, takes you past yourself. I believe that my journey has really been to remove my own anxiety. That's the key. The more anxiety you can remove, the more free you are to make that gesture, whatever the gesture is. The dialogue is first with the artist, but then it goes outward, and is shared with other people. And if the anxiety is removed <b>everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> close, everything is available, and it's just this little bit of confidence, or trust, that people have to delve into." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stephanie Zacharek of the Village Voice stated [...] "Gareth Edwards's new desecration of his (Godzilla) legend {{should make}} him (Godzilla) {{want to eat}} Hollywood for lunch", feeling that the film [...] "hits all the wrong beats" [...] but did praise Juliette Binoche and Bryan Cranston's performances, stating, [...] "Their few brief scenes, {{particularly}} Cranston's, make for the best dramatic moments in the movie" [...] and also praised Alexandre Desplat's score and the scenes involving Godzilla but stated [...] "it's just one tiny beat in an otherwise way-too-big movie that, weirdly, doesn't give us enough of the one big guy we showed up {{to see in the}} first place" [...] and concluded by stating, [...] "Godzilla is one of those generic, omnipresent blockbusters that's undone by the very spectacle it strives to dazzle us with: <b>Everything</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> gargantuan, so momentous, that nothing has any weight." [...] A. O. Scott of the New York Times stated the film [...] "is at once bloated and efficient, executed with tremendous discipline and intelligence and conceived with not too much of either" [...] and found that [...] "it surpasses Roland Emmerich’s 1998 Hollywood version" [...] and praised the film's aftermath destruction scenes, stating, [...] "the vistas of trampled cityscapes are frequently more memorable and always more haunting than the chaotic scenes of smashing and flooding that clutter the film’s climax" [...] but felt the characterization was [...] "thin" [...] and the performances were [...] "squandered" [...] but felt that the [...] "soul" [...] of the film [...] "dwells with the monsters". Matt Zoller Seitz highly praised the film's direction and craftsmanship, giving it three and a half out of four stars and stating that [...] "Godzilla represents some sort of high water mark (pun intended) in Hollywood's nearly forty year crusade to turn once-disreputable genre films into pop art that demands our contemplation, if only because of the wit and skill that its army of technicians lavished on each frame. The long shots of kaiju grappling in ruined cities are gloomily magnificent, like oil paintings of Biblical miracles." ...|$|E

60|$|Here, all {{the light}} clouds {{of the more}} solemn part of the {{proceedings}} passed away; every face shone forth joyously; and nothing was to be heard but congratulations and commendations. <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> beautiful! The lawn in front, the garden behind, the miniature conservatory, the dining-room, the drawing-room, the bedrooms, the smoking-room, and, above all, the study, with its pictures and easy-chairs, and odd cabinets, and queer tables, and books out of number, with a large cheerful window opening upon a pleasant lawn and commanding a pretty landscape, dotted here and there with little houses almost hidden by the trees; and then the curtains, and the carpets, and the chairs, and the sofas! <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> beautiful, so compact, so neat, and in such exquisite taste, said everybody, that there really was no deciding what to admire most.|$|R

60|$|When Mrs. Cliff left Edna and Ralph in San Francisco, {{and went}} home, {{nearly all the}} people in the little town who were worth {{considering}} gathered in and around her house to bid her welcome. They had heard of her shipwreck, but the details had been scanty and unsatisfactory, and the soul of the town throbbed with curiosity to know what had really happened to her. For the first few hours of her return Mrs. Cliff was in a state of heavenly ecstasy. <b>Everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> tidy, <b>everything</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> clean, every face beamed with such genial amity, her native air <b>was</b> <b>so</b> intoxicating, that she seemed to be in a sort of paradise.
