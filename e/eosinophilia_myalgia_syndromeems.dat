40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{preclinical}} and clinical evidence {{regarding the use}} of the dietary supplement 5 -hydroxytryptophan (5 -HTP) for the treatment of depression. In the absence of supplementation with exogenous 5 -HTP, the amount of endogenous 5 -HTP available for serotonin synthesis depends on the availability of tryptophan and on the activity of various enzymes, especially tryptophan hydroxylase, indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase, and tryptophan 2, 3 -dioxygenase (TDO). Factors affecting each of these are reviewed. The amount of 5 -HTP reaching the central nervous system (CNS) is affected by the extent to which 5 -HTP is converted to serotonin in the periphery. This conversion is controlled by the enzyme amino acid decarboxylase, which, in the periphery, can be blocked by peripheral decarboxylase inhibitors (PDIs) such as carbidopa. Preclinical and clinical evidence for the efficacy of 5 -HTP for depression is reviewed, with emphasis on double-blind, placebo-controlled (DB-PC) trials. Safety issues with 5 -HTP are also reviewed, with emphasis on <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> syndrome (EMS) and serotonin syndrome...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} shown that Na(+) -coupled transport of glucose and amino acids across the apical membrane of intestinal absorptive cells {{is accompanied by}} alterations in cytoskeletal structure and altered sieving of small hydrophilic solutes by tight junctions. Here we report that {{in response to the}} essential amino acid L-tryptophan at lumenal concentrations likely to be supraphysiological (1 mM or greater), these responses are so exaggerated as to induce disruption of tight junctions and transepithelial macromolecular leaks. Since these effects of L-tryptophan are energy and Na+ dependent and occur with mucosal but not serosal exposure to L-tryptophan, it appears they are triggered by activation of a Na(+) -nutrient cotransporter in the apical membrane of absorptive cells rather than by the presence of an unidentified trace contaminant. Our findings suggest the possibility that dietary supplementation by L-tryptophan may result in loss of the intestinal epithelial barrier to dietary antigens. We speculate that such a response to supraphysiologic tryptophan may contribute, in part, to the recently recognized curious tryptophan-induced <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> syndrome...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of the <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> syndrome (EMS) remains unclear. Several abnormal constituents {{have been}} found in the L-tryptophan lots responsible for the illness, particularly, 1, 1 -ethylidenebis[L-tryptophan], also called peak E or EBT, and 3 -phenylamino-alanine or peak 5. However, the role of these contaminants in the pathogenesis of EMS and in the development of fibrosis is unknown. We now report that peak E, a dimer of L-tryptophan, is a potent stimulus for human dermal fibroblast DNA and collagen synthesis. Peak E (0. 1 - 1. 0 microM) increased DNA synthesis up to four-fold (P = 0. 0001) in a dose-dependent manner (r = 0. 987). When added to monolayer cultures for 2 to 24 h, peak E (0. 5 to 100 microM) caused a progressive, more than threefold increase in alpha 1 (I) procollagen mRNA levels and collagenous protein. No increase in procollagen mRNA levels was found after the addition of another major L-tryptophan contaminant, peak 5, or with L-tryptophan itself. Transient transfection with a 2. 5 -kb alpha 1 (I) procollagen promoter-luciferase construct showed that peak E causes a twofold upregulation of promoter activity (P = 0. 022). Contraction of collagen gels, consisting of human dermal fibroblasts incorporated into a type I collagen lattice, was enhanced two-fold by exposure to peak E (P = 0. 001). We conclude that a major constituent of contaminated batches of L-tryptophan, peak E, is a potent stimulus for fibroblast activation and collagen synthesis. This stimulatory action of peak E may provide a direct mechanism for the development of fibrosis in EMS...|$|R
40|$|In 1989, the {{development}} of <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> syndrome (EMS) was observed in some patients after the intake of l-tryptophan containing several contaminants, including 1, 1 ′-ethylidenebis[l-tryptophan] (‘peak E’). Since l-tryptophan has been taken particularly by individuals suffering from functional somatic syndromes (FSS), such as fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), we put forward the hypothesis that EMS may have developed preferentially in patients with FSS as an allergic reaction towards the contaminant peak E. We therefore studied the immunological reactivity towards l-tryptophan and peak E in these individuals (n = 12) and compared these data with those obtained in 12 healthy controls and 12 patients with other chronic disorders. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were cultured for 7 days with pure l-tryptophan and peak E. Supernatant fluids were collected at day 7. The type 2 cytokines IL- 4, IL- 5 and IL- 10, and the type 1 cytokines IL- 2 and IFN-γ, were determined by a double sandwich ELISA. PBMC from seven of the 12 FSS patients, but {{only three of the}} 24 controls, produced cytokines after incubation with peak E (P < 0 · 05). Interestingly, six of the seven FSS patients reacting with peak E produced IL- 5 and/or IL- 10. In contrast, PBMC from only one patient with other chronic disorders and one healthy control secreted type 2 cytokines in response to peak E. The observed heightened type 2 reactivity towards the more immunogenic contaminant 1, 1 ′-ethylidenebis[l-tryptophan] in FSS patients may therefore be taken as an additional argument for our concept that EMS may have developed as a kind of drug-induced allergic disease...|$|R
40|$|Outbreak investigations, an {{important}} and challenging component of epidemiology and public health, can help identify the source of ongoing outbreaks and prevent additional cases. Even when an outbreak is over, a thorough epidemiologic and environmental investigation often can increase our knowledge of a given disease and prevent future outbreaks. Finally, outbreak investigations provide epidemiologic training and foster cooperation between the clinical and public health communities. Investigations of acute infectious disease outbreaks are very common, {{and the results of}} such investigations are often published; however, surprisingly little {{has been written about the}} actual procedures followed during such investigations (1, 2). Most epidemiologists and public health officials learn the procedures by conducting investigations with the initial assistance of more experienced colleagues. This article outlines the general approach to conducting an outbreak investigation. The approach applies not only to infectious disease outbreaks but also to outbreaks due to noninfectious causes (e. g., toxic exposure). How Outbreaks Are Recognized Possible outbreaks of disease come to the attention of public health officials in various ways. Often, an astute clinician, infection control nurse, or clinical laboratory worker first notices an unusual disease or an unusual number of cases of a disease and alerts public health officials. For example, staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome and <b>eosinophilia</b> <b>myalgia</b> syndrome were first noted by clinicians (3, 4). Frequently, it is the patient (or someone close to the patient) who first suspects a problem, as is often the case in foodborne outbreaks after a shared meal and as was the case in the investigation of a cluster of cases of apparent juvenile rheumatoid arthritis near Lyme, Connecticut, which led to the discovery of Lyme disease (5). Review of routinely collected surveillance data can also detec...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Introduction Eosinophilic {{fasciitis}} is {{an uncommon}} disorder with unknown etiology and a poorly understood pathogenesis. We present {{the cases of}} two patients with eosinophilic fasciitis with unusual presentation, and describe the clinical characteristics and laboratory findings related to them. Case presentation The first case involves a 29 -year-old Turkish man admitted with pain, edema and induration of his right-upper and left-lower limbs. Unilateral edema and stiffness with prominent pretibial edema was noted upon physical examination. A high eosinophil count {{was found on the}} peripheral smear. The second case involves a 63 -year-old Turkish man who had pain, edema, erythema, and itching on his upper and lower extremities, which developed after strenuous physical activity. He had cervical lymphadenopathy and polyarthritis upon physical examination, and rheumatoid factor and antinuclear antibody upon laboratory examination. Conclusion Eosinophilic fasciitis can present with various symptoms. When patients exhibit <b>eosinophilia,</b> arthralgia and <b>myalgia,</b> eosinophilic fasciitis should be considered as a possible diagnosis. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{the spring}} and summer of 1981, an {{epidemic}} of a new illness now referred to as the toxic oil syndrome occurred in central and northwestern Spain, resulting in some 20, 000 cases, 12, 000 hospital admissions and > 300 deaths in the 1 st year of the epidemic. The initial onset of illness was usuallv acute, and patients presented primarily with a respiratory syndrome involving cough, fever, dyspnea, hypoxemia, pulmonary infiltrates and pleural effusions. While approximately 50 % of patients recovered from this acute phase of the illness without apparent sequelae, the remaining patients developed an intermediate or chronic phase, or both, of illness involving severe <b>myalgia,</b> <b>eosinophilia,</b> peripheral nerve damage, sclerodermiform skin lesions, sicca syndrome, alopecia and joint contractures, among other findings. Epidemiologic and analytic chemical studies have clearly linked the toxic oil syndrome to the ingestion of oil mixtures containing rapeseed oil denatured with aniline. However, the precise identity of the etiologic agent within this oil has never been determined. Aniline itself did not cause the illness, but the causal agent may be a reaction product of aniline with some oil component. Although many aspects of disease activity in the involved patients have lessened with time, the ultimate consequences of their disease are not clear and are the subject of ongoing study. The recently described eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome in the United States clinically resembles the toxic oil syndrome...|$|R
