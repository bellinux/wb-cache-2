[...] Given that Justice Samuel Chase was acquitted by the Senate in his impeachment case on March 1, 1805, the day before the release of the More decision, [...] "ne can imagine John Marshall passing a sigh of relief as he handed down the judgment in More." [...] "he dismissal of More marked the end of Federalist efforts to obtain a Supreme Court ruling, directly or by implication, that the repeal of the 1801 Judiciary Act was unconstitutional. [...] "More is of a piece with Marbury and Stuart v. Laird in its avoidance of an opportunity for an open clash with political critics of the courts.

40|$|The subject <b>of</b> <b>declining</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> {{in private}} {{international}} law is one of enormous practical importance and academic interest. It is also a topic where a comparative approach is particularly revealing. This book contains the 17 national reports and the general report on the subject <b>of</b> `Rules for <b>declining</b> to exercise jurisdiction: Forum Non Conveniens, Lis Pendens'. The Reports were held in Athens/Delphi in August 1994. The list of nations for which a report has been prepared is as follows: Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Quebec, Finland, France, Germany, Great Britain, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, The Netherlands, New Zealand, Sweden, Switzerland, and USA. This book by bringing together all the reports on `Declining Jurisdiction' provides a unique insight into this topic, and, dealing as it does with a key aspect of {{private international law}}, fits very well into the Oxford series of monographs on private international law...|$|R

40|$|After {{the arrest}} of Augusto Pinochet {{more than a decade}} ago, {{universal}} jurisdiction was a political and legal reality and became a white hot subject of global controversy. Universal jurisdiction was hailed as one of the magic bullets in the campaign against impunity. Universal jurisdiction is the doctrine that allows any country to punish certain egregious crimes, regardless of wherever or by whomever they have been committed, even if it has no direct connection with the offense and there is an absence of the traditional grounds for jurisdiction. However Schabas rightly indicate that universal jurisdiction past is mysterious and its future uncertain. Some say there is <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction</b> or even state that there is a demise <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction.</b> Still some other commentators assert that universal jurisdiction simply does not exist. There are those who view the broadening of the scope <b>of</b> universal <b>jurisdiction</b> with extreme skepticism. The critics fear for the slippery slope which could lead to a radical and dangerous encroachment on the sovereignty of nations. Today there are those that see a “backlash” or “downtrend” in the movement for universal jurisdiction especially after the Arrest Warrant case. It is stated that the universal jurisdiction movement appears to be a moving train without its locomotive. Maybe it only lost some of its steam. On the other hand NGO’s assert that there is no question of the growing practice of states in regard to universal jurisdiction and the principle is supposed to be uncontested. Over exaggerated statements expressing support for universal jurisdiction are often found. Notwithstanding that Prof Schabas state that universal jurisdiction is an ideal subject for research; he has nevertheless opined that universal jurisdiction generates more heat than light. Many of the reports describe universal jurisdiction as important component in the struggle against impunity. According to him it is, but a small component or as stated by Bottini: “its application remains negligible. ” Schabas is of the opinion that international tribunals and truth commissions seem a better investment for scarce resources.

When he was about to proceed on his journey northward, the Archbishop of Glasgow, {{at the request of the}} Earl of Eglinton, permitted him to remain in Ayrshire, at Eglinton, where for about two months he preached in the hall and courtyard of the castle.

40|$|Community {{policing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} significant transformations in American policing (Maguire and King, 2004). While many assert that community policing played a significant role in the <b>decline</b> <b>of</b> national index crime over the last decade, research has yet to fully explore the contribution of community policing activities to aggregate crime trends (Eck and Maguire, 2001; GAO, 2005; Levitt, 2004; Zhao and Thurman, 2004). To fill this gap, this study assessed police involvement in eight community policing activities between 1997 and 2000. Focusing on subgroups <b>of</b> <b>jurisdictions</b> determined to be the most different on the basis of index crime rate change between the four year period of study, the research tested whether police involvement in community policing distinguished jurisdictions measuring improvement from those measuring worsened total, property, and violent index crime rates.

40|$|When private {{international}} law lawyers discuss jurisdiction, focus is typically placed primarily on personal jurisdiction, and secondarily on subject matter jurisdiction.

Scope <b>of</b> <b>jurisdiction</b> relates to the appropriate geographical scope of orders rendered by a court that has personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction.
