25|$|The {{simplest}} {{method for}} scan converting (rasterizing) a Bézier curve is to evaluate it at many closely spaced points and scan convert the approximating sequence of line segments. However, {{this does not}} guarantee that the rasterized output looks sufficiently smooth, because the points may be spaced too far apart. Conversely it may generate too many points {{in areas where the}} curve is close to linear. A common adaptive method is recursive subdivision, in which a curve's control points are checked to see if the curve approximates a straight line to within a small tolerance. If not, the curve is subdivided parametrically into two segments, 0 ≤ t ≤ 0.5 and 0.5 ≤ t ≤ 1, and the same procedure is applied recursively to each half.

40|$|Abstract—For {{real-time}} video streaming systems, the video packets arriving after the display deadline of their frames are considered as late-arrival packets, and typically they are discarded. This {{will affect the}} current frame and the following ones due to <b>error</b> <b>propagations.</b> For this reason, in this paper, we propose an approach to exploit the late-arrival and out-of-order packets, which includes two mechanisms. The first mechanism will use these packets to update the reference frames {{to make them more}} consistent with the encoder side, and this will eventually reduce the <b>error</b> <b>propagations.</b> The second mechanism will use these packets to increase the chance of successfully decoding the Reed-Solomon (RS) code. In the proposed approach, a sub-GOP based systematic RS code is used and optimized to exploit these packets, where the size of each sub-GOP and the parity packet number for each sub-GOP are optimally tuned...|$|R

Nigeria stock market prices were collected for the periods of seven hundred and twenty days and grouped into untranslated and translated train, validation and test data. A zero mean unit variance transformation was used to normalize the input variables {{in order to allow}} the same range which makes them to differ by order of magnitude. A 5 -j- 1 network topology was adopted because of five input variables in which variable j was determined by the number of hidden neurons during network selection. The untranslated and translated data served as input into the <b>error</b> back <b>propagation</b> algorithm and regression model which were written in Java Programming Language. The results of both untranslated and translated statements were analyzed and compared. The performance of translated NSMP using regression analysis or <b>error</b> back <b>propagation</b> was more superior than untranslated NSMP. The results also showed that percentage prediction accuracy of <b>error</b> back <b>propagation</b> model on untranslated NSMP ranged for 11. 3 % while 2. 7 % was for translated NSMP. The 2. 7 % percent accuracy as against 11. 3 % indicates the relative stability of translated NSMP prediction as against untranslated NSMP. The mean relative percentage error was very low in all hidden topologies of <b>error</b> back <b>propagation</b> of translated NSMP than untranslated NSMP. This indicates that translated NSMP prediction approach was superior to untranslated NSMP predicition...|$|R
