5|$|In early 1916, the {{battalion}} sailed to Alexandria on the Empress of Britain. From Alexandria, it travelled by train to bivouac at Tall al Kabir. At this time, {{the battalion}} received 367 reinforcements from Australia before undertaking defensive duties around Gebel Habieta, guarding the Suez Canal. In February, the AIF was re-organised and expanded. This saw the veteran battalions split to provide cadres for new battalions {{and as a}} part of this process, the 15th Battalion provided personnel to the 51st Battalion, by transferring the even numbered sections to the new battalion. At this time, the battalion received four Lewis Guns <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> direct fire support.|$|E
5|$|After the war, the Australian Army {{moved away}} from the machine gun {{battalion}} concept and no similar units were raised. The machine gun role was subsumed into the support companies of individual infantry battalions. The idea was arguably misunderstood by Australian commanders throughout the war and this may have influenced the decision {{to move away from the}} concept. When the units had been established, the intent had been for machine gun battalions to provide highly mobile fire support but this only worked where the principles of open warfare worked. Once the focus of Australian Army combat operations shifted to the Pacific, the machine gun battalions were largely misused, being employed in a static defensive capacity against short and medium range targets or for menial tasks, rather than as offensive weapons for long range fire support. The medium machine guns were also largely used in the same manner as light machine guns, such as the Bren. Other reasons identified for the concept's limited use include distrust of overhead fire by some commanders, a preference <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> fire support over attached sub-units, over-estimating the difficulty of transporting Vickers guns in the jungle and a tendency to ignore targets that could not be seen. The difficulties of target acquisition in dense jungle also contributed.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} to {{investigate}} the degradation abilities of various chlorinated aliphatics, benzene and its derivatives in order to treat organic polluted wastewaters efficiently by advanced oxidation processes (AOPs). A thermodynamic method is proposed to calculate the standard molar Gibbs energy of formation <b>for</b> aqueous <b>organic</b> species. Using the method proposed, the standard molar Gibbs energies of formation <b>for</b> 31 aqueous <b>organic</b> species are obtained. Moreover, the molar Gibbs energy change of reaction Δr Gm 0 <b>for</b> the <b>organic</b> species with hydroxyl radicals is calculated from the standard molar Gibbs energy of formation <b>for</b> aqueous <b>organic</b> species to determine the degradation order of ease <b>for</b> the <b>organic</b> species. New photocatalytic experiments are carried out for the model verification. The calculation results of the model agree with the available and new experimental results. This work shows that the thermodynamics of the degradation reaction <b>for</b> the <b>organic</b> pollutants in AOPs can find the corresponding relationships with the degradation reaction rate by experimental measurements. The work in this paper represents a success of thermodynamics for the application in environmental area. Validerad; 2009; 20090114 (ysko...|$|R
5|$|Sovereign {{reveals that}} the Reapers remain outside the Milky Way waiting <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> life to develop and {{discover}} the Mass Relays, before harvesting them when they reach their peak. Afterwards, with the bomb about to explode, Shepard hears that Ashley and Kaidan have both been pinned down, and must choose which one to rescue. Shepard also finds Saren, who claims that his allegiance to Sovereign will save organic life forms by demonstrating their usefulness to the Reapers. Liara is then able to pinpoint the Conduit's location back on the Normandy: a Prothean world known as Ilos. There, Shepard learns that the Citadel Station is actually a huge Mass Relay that the Reapers use to invade the galaxy. During the last extinction cycle, a few Protheans survived on Ilos via cryopreservation and then re-entered the Citadel Station via the Conduit, a reverse-engineered miniature Mass Relay disguised aboard the station as a statue. The Protheans sabotaged the Citadel to prevent the Reapers from remotely activating the Citadel Mass Relay. Saren plans to reach the Citadel by using the Conduit to allow Sovereign to activate the Citadel Mass Relay and trigger the Reaper invasion.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} an {{international}} standard for chemistry was first addressed in 1860 by a committee headed by German scientist Friedrich August Kekulé von Stradonitz. This committee was the first international conference to create an international naming system <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> compounds. The ideas that were formulated in that conference evolved into the official IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry. IUPAC stands as a legacy of this meeting, {{making it one of}} the most important historical international collaborations of chemistry societies. Since this time, IUPAC has been the official organization held with the responsibility of updating and maintaining official organic nomenclature. IUPAC as such was established in 1919. One notable country excluded from this early IUPAC is Germany. Germany's exclusion was a result of prejudice towards Germans by the Allied powers after World War I. Germany was finally admitted into IUPAC during 1929. However, Nazi Germany was removed from IUPAC during World War II.|$|E
5|$|The 2/43rd was {{withdrawn}} to Khassa in Palestine in December and {{took part in}} a divisional parade that month in Gaza, before embarking aboard the Queen Mary, bound for Australia, in January 1943. The Queen Mary formed part of a large convoy established under Operation Pamphlet to transport the 9th Division back to Australia to fight the Japanese in the Pacific. After around a month at sea, the division arrived at Fremantle on 18 February and, after the Western Australian members disembarked, it continued eastwards, reaching Sydney on 27 February. From there, the battalion entrained from Pyrmont, and by 1 March 1943 had arrived in Adelaide, after which members were granted three weeks leave. A welcome-home parade through the city streets was held that month, watched by a crowd of over 200,000, after which the battalion concentrated at Springbank in Adelaide. They entrained for the Atherton Tablelands on 29 March 1943, reaching Kairi, on 6 April 1943. They would remain there for the next four months, training in preparation for jungle warfare against the Japanese in New Guinea. During this time, the battalion was converted to the jungle divisional establishment, which saw the reduction of its authorised strength to about 800 personnel. The number of vehicles allocated to the battalion was also reduced with heavy vehicles being replaced by jeeps. The carrier and anti-aircraft platoons were removed from the battalion's establishment, while a Vickers machine-gun platoon was raised and the number of mortars allocated <b>for</b> <b>organic</b> indirect fire support was increased. A batch of 338 reinforcements arrived to make up for earlier losses and transfers; many of these men came from states other than South Australia, resulting in a more diverse demographic within the battalion.|$|E
