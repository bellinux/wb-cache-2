40|$|We analyze {{possible}} future trends in dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) export by world rivers and associated emissions of nitrous oxide (N 2 O). Our scenarios either assume that current trends continue or that nitrogen (N) inputs to aquatic systems are reduced {{as a result}} of changes in agriculture practices and fuel combustion technologies.

We furthermore calculate that relatively large reductions in NOy deposition rates in Europe (of about 80 %) may reduce DIN export by rivers by a moderate 8 % or less, relative to BAU levels. The potential effect of reduced NOy deposition on riverine DIN export is moderate, because most N in European rivers stems from agriculture, and not from fuel combustion.

We characterized the biogeochemical role of a seasonally flooded tree island during wet season inundation, specifically examining hydrologically mediated flows of nitrogen (N) and N retention by the tree island. We estimated ecosystem N standing stocks and fluxes, soil and litter N transformation rates, and hydrologic fluxes of N to quantify the net ecosystem N mass flux. Results showed that hydrologic sources of N were dominated by surface water loads of nitrate (NO 3) and ammonium (NH 4). Nitrate immobilization by soils and surficial leaf litter was an important sink for surface water dissolved inorganic N (DIN). We estimated that the net annual DIN retention by a seasonally flooded tree island was 20. 5 ± 5. 0 g m− 2 during wet season inundation. Based on the estimated tree island surface water <b>DIN</b> loading <b>rate,</b> a seasonally flooded tree island retained 76 % of imported DIN.

Besides direct excretion, an important pathway of nutrient regeneration {{is through the}} decomposition of feces and pseudofeces, of which mussels can produce large quantities. Information on mussel feces and pseudofeces quality and nutrient regeneration rates is scarce. Feces and pseudofeces, produced in varying proportions, are commonly treated as one pool. We determined nutrient regeneration rates of feces and pseudofeces decomposition in incubations using natural seawater and juvenile Mytilus edulis from spat collectors. Apart from one 1993 trial, our results {{are the first to}} present nutrient regeneration dynamics of feces and pseudofeces separately. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and phosphate regeneration continued at stable rates for approximately 3 wk, after which 13. 1 and 12. 4 % of the available N and 8. 7 and 7. 9 % of the available P was regenerated from feces and pseudofeces, respectively. Rates of silicate regeneration declined continuously, which we attribute to its accumulation in the experimental setup. Coinciding environmental levels of DIN and silicate at growth-limiting levels indicate the potential ecological relevance of biodeposit decomposition. Overall <b>DIN</b> regeneration <b>rates</b> were similar between feces and pseudofeces, but depletion of ammonia was initially more rapid for pseudofeces due to stronger nitrification. Phosphate and silicate regeneration rates were 1. 1 and 1. 4 times greater from feces than pseudofeces, respectively.

An approach to better service our continuance and future generations' livelihoods is being explored by implementing natural systems technologies. Ecological engineering is a mechanism that can provide simple, 'low-tech' design and infrastructure while encouraging the growth and development of nature's complexity as the primary operating system. Ecologically engineered fixed film biological reactors were designed and implemented to remediate freshwater, aquaculture wastewater on Coconut Island, Oahu. The biological reactors principally operate by utilizing the inherent, multifaceted biochemical development of biofilm ecologies. The primary objective of this research was to design 'low-tech' systems that compared naturally occurring media commonly found on Pacific Islands for their use in fixed film biological reactor technology to remove dissolved inorganic nitrogen from the wastewater. The media researched for the comparison study included: coral rubble, lava rock (pumice), bluestone (hydropressurized basalt), coconut fiber, and a synthetic geotextile material. The fixed film filters were connected to one freshwater aquaculture tank containing Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus). Both the influent (fish tank) and the effluents from the five filters were analyzed for total suspended solids, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, and phosphate concentrations. A replicate system was also designed on a small scale to test for data reproducibility and was compared to the Coconut Island system. Overall, ammonium and total suspended solids reduction was marked in all the systems. Therefore in order to compare the media, the removal rate of ammonium + nitrate/nitrite (DIN) was calculated for all the systems and statistical analysis was conducted to determine differences between <b>DIN</b> removal <b>rate</b> efficiencies...|$|R
40|$|Nutrient supply, {{including}} `new' nitrogen (N) added through N 2 -fixation, nutrient {{release from}} sediments and freshwater inflow, can {{be important in}} increasing and sustaining estuarine phytoplankton blooms. In return, dense blooms in shallow water estuaries may affect nutrient recycling by elevating the pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations as well as increasing sedimentation of phytoplankton detritus. My dissertation addressed the interaction between cyanobacterial blooms and biogeochemical nutrient recycling in the tidal-fresh and oligohaline region of the Sassafras River, {{a tributary of the}} Chesapeake Bay, Maryland, USA. When high pH overlying water comes in contact with sediments, the subsequent pH penetration causes desorption of exchangeable ammonium and converts NH 4 + to NH 3 from both porewater and absorbed NH 4 + pools. Alkaline pH and the toxicity of NH 3 may inhibit nitrification in the thin aerobic zone. During massive cyanobacterial blooms in summer, high effluxes of SRP and total ammonium from sediments were associated with reduced nitrification and denitrification rates. Retention of N in the upper estuary and increased dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) release into the water column may facilitate nitrogen assimilation by cyanobacteria in N-limited water. High pH also resulted in a significant increase in soluble reactive phosphate (SRP) flux and lead to relatively high SRP compared to <b>DIN</b> flux <b>rates,</b> which may support the high P demand of diazotrophic cyanobacteria. As N became limiting in summer, the dominant cyanobacterial assemblage changed from non-N 2 fixers (Microcystis spp.) to N 2 fixers (Anabaena spp., Pseudanabaena sp. and Synechococcus sp.). Warm temperatures, high P availability and low salinity are environmental factors associated with high rates of N 2 fixation. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) limitation, high pH, and high DO concentrations, mediated by cyanobacterial photosynthesis, can cause decreases in photosynthetic efficiency and daytime N 2 fixation of the cyanobacterial assemblage. Species succession appears to enable the cyanobacterial assemblage to adapt to changing environmental conditions caused by the bloom, including high pH and DO, and to maintain N 2 fixation for sustained growth...|$|R

40|$|Over half of {{the total}} nitrogen, phosphorus, {{silicate}} and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) loading was discharged from the Wile River into the Thau Lagoon waters within the first five days of what {{was considered to be}} the autumn flash flood period. Such loads represented about 8 % and 3 % of the yearly averaged total nitrogen and phosphorus load in Thau Lagoon, respectively. Although this event affected > 20 % of the total lagoon volume, river trace metal loads contributed apparently only weakly to the increase in labile trace metal concentrations in the lagoon surface waters. Differences between theoretical dilution values and observed values were also noticed for phosphate, silicate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. DOC losses (10 - 50 %) mainly through flocculation, together with the substantial increases in some metallic contaminants such as Zn (from 6 to > 30 mu g L- 1) observed during the flash flood in saline lagoon waters, may have limited the carbon production of bacterial communities. The potential osmotic shock and the increase in turbidity may mainly explain the low phytoplankton C turnover rates (average of 0. 02 h(- 1)) measured in brackish waters (< 30) during periods of heavy flood discharge. The dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NO 3 + NH 4) enrichment measured 12 days after the flash flood event in saline lagoon surface waters (from 22 to 143 mu g N L- 1) led to a substantial increase in phytoplanktonic C production and associated <b>DIN</b> uptake <b>rates</b> (from 2. 6 to 7. 0 mu g C L- 1 h(- 1) and from 0. 5 to 1. 1 mu g N L- 1 h(- 1), respectively). Subsequent accumulation in particulate organic carbon and nitrogen was not observed in the area studied during and after the flash flood period, averaging 549 +/- 50 mu g C L- 1 and 168 +/- 9 mu g N L- 1, respectively.

40|$|Microphytobenthos and macroalgal mats are {{simultaneously}} present in eutrophic lagoons {{and are expected}} to have different direct and indirect effects on nitrogen related processes through uptake and inhibition or stimulation of microbial activity. To assess the relative contribution of different primary producer communities and heterotrophic processes to benthic nitrogen cycling, we studied nitrogen uptake and bacterial denitrification in the eutrophic Sacca di Goro lagoon (northern Italy). Benthic fluxes of oxygen and dissolved inorganic nitrogen (<b>DIN),</b> and <b>rates</b> of nitrification coupled (Dn) and water–nitrate (Dw) denitrification were measured every 30 – 45 days for one year at two shallow sites. Station Giralda is close to the main freshwater inlet, has turbid waters and muddy-organic and bioturbated sediments with microphytobenthos (MPB). Station Gorino is brackish with muddy-sand sediments which are covered by macroalgal mats of the genus Ulva. Here, sediment patches with and without macroalgae (MA) were simultaneously studied. Sediments with MPB were net heterotrophic and regenerated large amounts of ammonium to the water column. At Gorino, sediments with MA were net autotrophic through the year, and DIN fluxes were mainly controlled by macroalgal uptake. On an annual basis, denitrification rates were three fold higher at Giralda (2. 27 ± 0. 06 mol N m− 2 yr− 1) than at Gorino (0. 83 ± 0. 01 mol N m− 2 yr− 1), due to higher nitrate in the water column and nitrification in surface sediments. At Gorino, denitrification was one order of magnitude lower than DIN uptake by macroalgae (10. 39 ± 1. 30 mol N m− 2 yr− 1). Nevertheless, the differences between denitrification rates in sediments with and without MA were unexpectedly negligible, showing that the denitrification capacity was not suppressed by macroalgal competition. Results from this study suggest that in eutrophic lagoons nitrogen cycling seems less affected by MPB compared to more oligotrophic coastal waters and that most of the available DIN flows through benthic macroalgae. However, Ulva is only a temporary N-sink and most of its nitrogen pool can be either rapidly recycled or exported by tidal currents to the open sea...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} factors affecting the uptake of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) by the temperate symbiotic sea anemone, Anemonia viridis. Laboratory experiments were used to test <b>DIN</b> uptake <b>rates</b> of symbiotic and aposymbiotic (alga-free) individuals, to enable the prediction of the magnitude of <b>DIN</b> flux <b>rates</b> in anemones in their natural environment, and to allow the construction of a model of the DIN fluxes in the association. It was also hoped to assess the potential for fully autotrophic growth in this species. Uptake rates were measured by following depletion of DIN from small-volume incubation chambers that had been enriched to produce DIN concentrations across the reported range for temporate coastal waters. At light levels of 190 E. m^- 2, ammonia was taken up by symbiotic anemones from all concentrations tested, whilst aposymbionts lost ammonia to the surrounding sea water. Nitrate was not taken up by any of the anemones. The relationship between the weight-specific ammonia flux rate and ambient ammonia concentration was linear for both symbionts and aposymbionts. In all cases the slope of the relationship was positive, symbionts showing increasing rates of uptake and apsoymbionts showing decreasing rates of efflux with increasing ammonia concentration. There was no evidence of Michaelis-Menten uptake kinetics across the range of concentrations used, despite extending this to 30 g-at NH 3 - N. 1 - 1 in an attempt to show saturation of uptake. In darkness, the elevation of the rate/concentration relationship was depressed for symbionts, but not for aposymbionts, so that symbionts showed efflux of ammonia at concentrations below 4 g-at NH_ 3 -N. 1 ^- 1. The elevation increased with light intensity up to 50 E. m- 2. s- 1, whilst the slope of the relationship remained constant. Above 50 E. m^- 2 the elevation could not increase, but the slope became greater. Feeding the anemones with squid mantle tissue three days prior to experiments had variable effects on ammonia flux rates, but there was a tendency for the elevation of the rate/concentration relationship to drop in recently fed anemones, compared to starved anemones at the same light intensity. Effects are likely to be more marked over the first 24 hours after feeding, and ammonia flux during this period may have significant consequences for the nitrogen balance of the association. Frehsly isolated zooxanthellae took up ammonia, and showed Michaelis-Menten type uptake kinetics, with k_s between 3 and 7 g-at NH 3 -N. 1 - 1, and max between 0. 025 and 0. 043 g-at NH_ 3 -N. (g chla) - 1. h- 1. Uptake rates were not affected by light level, and were an order of magnitude higher than those of the intact association over the range of experimental concentrations used. Incubation of the intact association with 15 NH 3 -enriched sea water resulted in the 15 N being incorporated into the zooxanthellae, and not the host tissue, over 30 minutes exposure to the labelled ammonia. This showed directly that the algae are responsible for the ammonia uptake of the association. The results obtained are consistent with a two-component uptake system, diffusion across the animal cell membrane being driven by a concentration gradient produced by algal ammonia assimilation. The observed kinetics are the result of two antagonistic processes; the catabolic production of ammonia by the animal cell, and the active uptake of ammonia by the algae. It appears that algal ammonia uptake is saturated at irradiances of 50 E. m^- 2. s^- 1 and below, and unsaturated at higher irradiances. Light levels and ammonia concentrations were measured in the vicinity of a natural population of Anemonia viridis in Loch Sween, Argyll. The laboratory experiments were used to predict the net metabolic gain or loss of DIN experienced by anemones under the measured field conditions. Ambient ammonia concentrations were negligible around the anemones in Loch Sween throughout the year, and under such conditions a net loss of nitrogen would have occurred, making a heterotrophic input of nitrogen necessary for growth. Net nitrogen gain may, however, occur at ambient ammonia concentrations that could exist in rockpools further south in Britain, where A. viridis is frequently the dominant animal species. A laboratory experiment was conducted to test for the possibility of autotrophic growth in the presence of adequate levels of DIN. Unfortunately, experimental conditions did not consistently provide high enough concentrations of ammonia for net nitrogen gain to be predicted, but anemones exposed to elevated levels of DIN for 8 weeks lost significantly less weight than anemones kept in sea water with negligible ammonia concentrations The weight loss of the DIN-'fed' anemones corresponded closely to the weight of lost nitrogen predicted from the flux experiments, after conversion to equivalent weight of protein. It remains to be seen if Anemonia viridis can survive and grow autotrophically, but even in the nitrogen-poor environment of a Scottish sea loch, the algae can potentially supply 86 - 90 % of the associations basal nitrogen requirements. The capacity for DIN uptake is clearly an important factor in the success of this species in temperate waters...|$|R

Shifts in benthic community composition to higher soft coral abundances have been reported for many degraded reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific. However, it is not clear to what extent soft coral abundance and physiology are influenced by water quality. In this study, live benthic cover and water quality (i. e. dissolved inorganic nutrients (DIN), turbidity (NTU), and sedimentation) were assessed at three sites (< 20 km north of Jakarta) in Jakarta Bay (JB) and five sites along the outer Thousand Islands (20 – 60 km north of Jakarta). This was supplemented by measurements of photosynthetic yield and, for the first time, respiratory electron transport system (ETS) activity of two dominant soft coral genera, Sarcophyton spp. and Nephthea spp. Findings revealed highly eutrophic water conditions in JB compared to the outer Thousand Islands, with 44 % higher DIN load (7. 65 μM/L), 67 % higher NTU (1. 49 NTU) and 47 % higher sedimentation rate (30. 4 g m− 2 d− 1). Soft corals were the dominant type of coral cover within the bay (2. 4 % hard and 12. 8 % soft coral cover) compared to the outer Thousand Islands (28. 3 % hard and 6. 9 % soft coral cover).

[...] The Essex V6 also formed the base for the 3.4 L Cosworth GAA born in May 1972 and designed by Mike Hall, also responsible for designing Cosworth's famous DFV Engine [...] the GAA with the benefit of 100mm bores, DOHC aluminium alloy heads, Lucas mechanical fuel injection, a dry sump oiling system and a steel crankshaft generated [...] at 9000 rpm and 300 ft/lb of torque, Mike Hall's intention was to design the cylinder heads so that 3 spark plugs per cylinder could be fitted but this idea was dropped since there wasn't any appreciatable increase in power or torque, the original objective was an engine with a minimum of 400 Hp, this objective was exceeded with the engine making 420 Hp in the first test run. This engine was used in the racing version of the Capri RS 3100, competing successfully in the European Touring Car Championship, as well as in Formula 5000 single-seaters. 100 kits were also sold by Ford Motorsport[...]|$|R
40|$|Our data, {{as part of}} the OISO (Ocean Indien Service d'Observation) campaign, {{contributes}} {{to a better understanding of}} the physical and biological factors controlling N 2 fixation in the Southern Indian Ocean and the French Southern and Antarctic lands during Austral summer January and February 2017. We measured N 2 and C fixation as well as NH 4 + and NO 3 - assimilation in 3 - 6 replicates per station. Additionally, we measured diagnostic pigment concentrations to evaluate phtosynthetic community composition. For pigment analysis 4 L water was filtered through 25 mm Whatman GF/F filters (pressure drop < 10 kPa). Samples were stored at - 80 °C until analysis. Pigments were analysed using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Pigment concentration were calculated according to Kilias et al (2013, doi: 10. 1111 /jpy. 12109). N 2 fixation experiments were carried out in three to six replicates for each station. Incubations were done in pre-acid washed polycarbonate bottles on deck with ambient light conditions. All polycarbonate incubation bottles were rinsed with deionized water, and seawater prior to incubation. We used the combination of the bubble approach (Montoya et al., 1996) and the dissolution method (Mohr et al., 2010, doi: 10. 1371 /journal. pone. 0012583) proposed by Klawonn et al. (2015, doi: 10. 3389 /fmicb. 2015. 00769). Bottles were filled up to capacity to avoid air contamination. Incubations were initialized by adding a 10 ml 15 - 15 N gas bubble. Bottles were gently rocked for 15 minutes. Finally, the remaining bubble was removed to avoid equilibration between gas and aqueous phase. after 24 hours a water subsample was taken to a 12 ml exetainer and preserved with 100 µl HgCl 2 solution for later determination of exact 15 N- 15 N concentration. Natural 15 N 2 was determined using Membrane Inlet Mass Spectrometry (MIMS; GAM 200, IPI) for each station. Analysis of 15 N 2 incorporated was carried out by the Isotopic Laboratory at the UC Davis, California campus. We used stable isotope tracers (15 N) to measure dissolved inorganic nitrogen (<b>DIN)</b> assimilation <b>rates.</b> Experiments were initiated by adding a known concentration of 0. 05 of K 15 NO 3 and 15 NH 4 Cl for oligotrophic waters of the IO and 0. 625 µmol L- 1 for HNLC regions in the ACC and PF (Knap et al., 1994, Waite et al., 2007, doi: 10. 1016 /j. dsr 2. 2006. 12. 010) to one litre polycarbonate bottles. For C assimilation experiments, we added 20 µmol L- 1 of NaH 13 CO 3 to one of each of N 2 fixation, NH 4 + and NO 3 - assimilation experiment bottles. For incubation, we followed the same procedure as for N 2 fixation experiments. Findings reveal that N 2 fixation occurs throughout the whole sampling area up to 55 °S latitude. In addition, variations of N 2 fiaxation rates between replicates were relatively high indicating a great heterogeneity of the French Southern and Antarctic waters.

40|$|Spatial {{distribution}} of nitrogen species across the Similan Islands chain from {{west to east}} directions were investigated during a low and high large amplitude internal waves (LAIW) season in December 2010 and March 2011. Periodic water sampling {{was performed on the}} west side Similan reef in a depth of about 15 - 17 meter together with an in situ temperature logged CTD. Temporal samplings were carried out to determine the dominant nitrogen species in the soliton water reaching the Similan island chain. The major inorganic nitrogen species were chosen in order to determine dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) uptake in screlactenian corals. Pocillopora verrucosa (Ellis & Solander, 1786) was assigned as experimental species because of its common presence on both, west and east sides of the Similan Islands and Racha Island. 40 coral nubbins were collected in situ and reared in the PMBC aquarium for the experimental approaches. The corals were incubated in a Red Sea Salt® solution to control the organic and inorganic nutrient background. Normal warm reef temperature (28 °C) and cold LAIW temperature (20 °C) were applied in the incubations with different DIN concentrations (control N, 20 μM NO 3 -, 6 μM NH 4 + 20 and 20 μM NO 3 - & 6 μM NH 4 +) under both dark and light conditions. The incubation period was 2 hours but the water samples were taken as time series after 0, 10, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes respectively. The <b>DIN</b> uptake <b>rates</b> were calculated per coral surface area and time period. Additionally, in order to get information on the micro scale of inorganic nitrogen uptake, labeled 15 NO 3 - and 15 NH 4 + were used in a further incubation run. Nitrate was found to be the dominant DIN in the soliton waters approaching the reefs at the Similan Islands. The NO 3 - uptake experiments under low temperature conditions revealed a significant negative effect on the nitrate uptake rate in both light and dark. However, the concentration-dependent uptake behavior was found in both NH 4 + and NO 3 - enriched experiments. The concentration of DIN present in water had a higher effect on the uptake rates than temperature. High NH 4 + concentration was shown to limit NO 3 – uptake. NH 4 + was more favorable to P. verrucosa than NO 3 -. Light independent uptakes were discovered in both NH 4 + and NO 3 - enriched experiments. The highest uptake rates were found {{at the beginning of the}} incubation experiments (10 minutes after the start) in both NH 4 + and NO 3 - enriched experiments. The labeled DIN experiments showed that the symbiotic algae are the terminal station for both NO 3 - and NH 4 +. Delta 15 N enrichment exhibits similar results in temperature dependence and concentration dependence as found in normal DIN uptake experiments. Interestingly, a higher uptake rate of NH 4 + was found in the zooxanthellae under enriched NH 4 + & NO 3 - combined with low temperature conditions. LAIW seem to be favorable for the symbiotic corals in the Similans with a high inorganic nutrient supply. Even though the low temperature entrained by the LAIW to the reefs suppresses the optimum uptake the higher abundance of DIN has a greater effect on the corals. This denotes differences in the uptake behavior of corals growing on the exposed side of the Similan Islands (west) and the sheltered sides (east). With this study a possible explanation might be visualized to the differences of the framework formations found on the LAIW exposed and sheltered reefs...|$|R
