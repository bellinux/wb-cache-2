I wish to see you—It was {{perfectly}} well when I went to bed—I awoke in the night to give it suck it appeared to be sleeping so quietly that I would not awake it. It was dead then, but we did not find that out till morning—from its appearance it evidently died of convulsions—Will you come—you are so calm a creature & Shelley is afraid of a fever from the milk—for <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> longer a mother now.|$|E
5|$|A plain {{soldier and}} {{business}} man. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> politician, nor have I {{any desire to}} be one. In {{the course of my}} commercial career it has been my fate to have had much experience of politicians and their ways. What I have seen in the course of that experience has given me little respect either for the professional politician or his methods. I am desirous of seeing this country governed in the ways of clear common sense and good sound business principles, and I think that desire of mine is heartily share by {{the vast majority of the}} population.|$|E

I can see past the {{decision}} of this House either for or against me, but whether it be against me or for me, I know, {{and it is no}} vain boast to say so, for even my enemies will admit that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> boaster, that there does not exist in Canada a man who has given more of his time, more of his heart, more of his wealth, or more of his intellect and power, as it may be, for the good of this Dominion of Canada.|$|E

25|$|In a later-2010s emo revival, bands {{have been}} {{inspired}} by the sound and aesthetics of 1990s and early-2000s emo. Mainly underground artists who {{have been part of the}} movement are Modern Baseball, The World Is a Beautiful Place & <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>No</b> Longer Afraid to Die, A Great Big Pile of Leaves, Pianos Become the Teeth, Empire! Empire! (I Was a Lonely Estate), Touché Amoré, Into It. Over It., and the Hotelier. Modern emo bands with a more hardcore punk style include Title Fight and Small Brown Bike.|$|E
25|$|When evening comes, I go back home, {{and go to}} my study. On the threshold, I {{take off}} my work clothes, covered in mud and filth, and I put on the clothes an {{ambassador}} would wear. Decently dressed, I enter the ancient courts of rulers who have long since died. There, I am warmly welcomed, and I feed on the only food I find nourishing and was born to savour. I am not ashamed {{to talk to them}} and ask them to explain their actions and they, out of kindness, answer me. Four hours go by without my feeling any anxiety. I forget every worry. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> longer afraid of poverty or frightened of death. I live entirely through them.|$|E

500|$|Weary {{of ideological}} fealty to Rand's {{philosophy}} of Objectivism, Peart {{has sought to}} remind listeners of his eclecticism and independence in interviews.

500|$|... 2013: Favre's agent Bus Cook {{indicated}} {{early in}} the season that Favre could still play in the NFL. When asked about what his agent said, Favre responded [...] "I am (in shape), but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> way considering playing...The stress level was much, much more (when I played)....The demands are, don't get me wrong, I want to win, but it's not a job." [...] A few weeks later, in late October, the St. Louis Rams called Favre after their starting quarterback Sam Bradford was lost for the season, but Favre declined their offer to bring him out of retirement.|$|E
500|$|Beauregard {{served as}} {{adjutant}} general for the Louisiana state militia, 1879–88. In 1888, {{he was elected}} as commissioner of public works in New Orleans. When John Bell Hood and his wife died in 1879, leaving ten destitute orphans, Beauregard used his influence to get Hood's memoirs published, with all proceeds going to the children. He was appointed by the governor of Virginia to be the grand marshal of the festivities associated with the laying of the cornerstone of Robert E. Lee's statue in Richmond. But when Jefferson Davis died in 1889, Beauregard refused the honor of heading the funeral procession, saying [...] "We have always been enemies. I cannot pretend I am sorry he is gone. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> hypocrite." ...|$|E

500|$|Larter next {{appeared}} as Zerelda Mimms {{in the western}} comedy American Outlaws. Directed by Les Mayfield and co-starring Colin Farrell and Scott Caan, the movie was poorly received by critics and at the box office, garnering US$13 million {{at the end of}} its theatrical run. She also starred in Kevin Smith's Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. That year, Larter appeared on the cover of Maxim magazine and performed in the stage play The Vagina Monologues in New York City. In Spring 2002, Larter moved from Los Angeles to New York. [...] "I was too young and impressionable to handle the pressures of L.A." [...] Larter recalled in an interview, [...] "I'm a woman now. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> longer the little girl who could be easily influenced." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 2009, {{speculation}} arose {{that group}} member Amelle Berrabah {{had left the}} Sugababes following reports of tension with band member Keisha Buchanan. However, it was announced on 21 September 2009 that Buchanan, the sole original member of the group, had officially left the Sugababes. Buchanan clarified the departure on her official Twitter account, writing: [...] "I'm sad to say that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> longer {{a part of the}} Sugababes ... Although it was not my choice to leave, it's time to enter a new chapter in my life ... Sometimes a breakdown in communication and lack of trust can result in many different things." [...] Buchanan was replaced by former Eurovision contestant Jade Ewen. As a result of the line-up change, [...] "Wear My Kiss" [...] was re-recorded for the inclusion of vocals from new member Ewen and the removal of vocals from Buchanan.|$|E
500|$|This {{morning at}} 11 o'clock I have {{attacked}} the enemy.... All my troops have worked wonders, {{but at a}} cost of innumerable losses. Our men got into confusion. I assembled them three times. In the end I was in danger of getting captured and had to retreat. My coat is perforated by bullets, two horses of mine have been shot dead. My misfortune is that I am still living... Our defeat is very considerable: To me remains 3,000 men from an army of 48,000 men. At the moment in which I report all this, everyone is on the run; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> more master of my troops. Thinking of the safety of anybody in Berlin is a good activity... It is a cruel failure that I will not survive. The consequences of the battle will be worse than the battle itself. I do not have any more resources, and—frankly confessed—I believe that everything is lost. I will not survive the doom of my fatherland. Farewell forever! ...|$|E

In October, Abdulmutallab told his father via text message saying {{that he did not want}} to attend business school in Dubai, and wanted instead to study Islamic law and Arabic in Yemen. When his father refused to pay for it, Abdulmutallab said he was [...] "already getting everything for free". He text-messaged his father, saying [...] "I've found a new religion, the real Islam", [...] "You should just forget about me, I'm never coming back", and [...] "Forgive me for any wrongdoing, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> longer your child".

500|$|In {{the short}} story by Graham Greene, May we borrow your husband?, a {{character}} comments on her breasts as, [...] "Everybody could grow them big except me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> Jayne Mansfield, I can tell you." [...] In the 2001 fiction and poetry collection of Zaffi Gousopoulos, The I. V. Lounge Reader, a character tries out lipsticks in Mansfield colors and lifting underwear to emphasize her femininity. [...] "All women aspire to be Jayne Mansfield", says a character in Drake Worthington's 2002 book, St. Vincent's Manhattan, while trying out a bra. In the Seinfeld episode [...] "The Implant" [...] Jerry quips [...] "you know that Jayne Mansfield had some big breasts!" [...] to girlfriend Sidra (Teri Hatcher) {{as he tries to}} figure out if her breasts are in fact real. Mansfield Domes are the unofficial names of two prominent granite mounds located in Yosemite National Park. In Toni Morrison's Beloved a character comments [...] "Yeah, while I'm nursing. I feel like Jayne Mansfield" [...] when her son comments on how big her breasts are.|$|E
500|$|Shackleton {{returned}} to Britain from the Endurance expedition in late May 1917, while World War I was under way. Many {{of his men}} enlisted promptly upon their return. [...] Too old to enlist, Shackleton nevertheless sought {{an active role in}} the war effort, and eventually departed for Murmansk with the temporary army rank of major, as part of a military mission to North Russia. Shackleton expressed his dissatisfaction with this role in letters home: [...] "I feel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> use to anyone unless I am outfacing the storm in wild lands." [...] He {{returned to}} England in February 1919 and began plans to set up a company that would, with the cooperation of the North Russian Government, develop the natural resources of the region. This scheme came to nothing, as the Red Army took control of that part of Russia during the Russian Civil War; to provide himself with an income, Shackleton had to rely on the lecture circuit. During the winter of 1919–20 he lectured twice a day, six days a week, for five months.|$|E

500|$|Love {{has played}} a variety of Fender guitars {{throughout}} her career, including a Jaguar and a vintage 1965 Jazzmaster; the latter was purchased by the Hard Rock Cafe and is on display in New York City. Love is seen playing her Jazzmaster in the music video for [...] "Miss World". Earlier in Hole's career, between 1989 and 1991, Love primarily played a Rickenbacker 425 because she [...] "preferred the 3/4 neck", but she destroyed the guitar onstage at a 1991 concert opening for The Smashing Pumpkins. In the mid-1990s, she often played a guitar made by Mercury, an obscure company that manufactured custom guitars, {{as well as a}} Univox Hi-Flier. Fender's Vista Venus, designed by Love in 1998, was partially inspired by Rickenbacker guitars as well as her Mercury. During her 2010 and more recent tours, Love {{has played a}} Rickenbacker 360 onstage. She has referred to herself as [...] "a shit guitar player", further commenting in a 2014 interview: [...] "I can still write a song, but [...] sounds like shit... I used to be a good rhythm player but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> longer dependable." [...] Love's setup has included Fender tube gear, Matchless, Ampeg, Silvertone and a solid-state 1976 Randall Commander.|$|E
500|$|The term [...] "New Wave" [...] did {{not meet}} with {{universal}} approval among those who were regarded as part of it. [...] Brian Aldiss, for example, wrote to Judith Merril in 1966 that he suspected the term was [...] "a journalistic invention of yours and Mike Moorcock's", and added [...] "I feel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>no</b> part of the New Wave; I was here before 'em, and by God I mean to be here after they've gone (still writing bloody science fiction)!" [...] Merril was a key advocate for the New Wave, and popularized it in her anthology England Swings SF, which appeared in 1968; she spent almost a year in London, living near Moorcock, when researching the anthology in 1966–1967. [...] Merril and writer Christopher Priest were among those who used the term [...] "New Wave" [...] to describe the work being done in New Worlds, but Aldiss {{was not the only}} writer to object to the term, and it never received a generally accepted definition. [...] Critic Brian Attebery characterizes it as a [...] "disruptive, existentially fraught and formally daring" [...] style; Peter Nicholls hesitates to define it but comments that [...] "perhaps the fundamental element was the belief that sf could and should be taken seriously as literature". [...] In a 1967 interview, Ballard, one of the writers most closely associated with the New Wave, described modern U.S. sf as extrovert and optimistic, and contrasted it with [...] "the new science fiction, that other people apart from myself are now beginning to write", which he saw as [...] "introverted, possibly pessimistic rather than optimistic, much less certain of its own territory." ...|$|E
