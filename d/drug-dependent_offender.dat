While most European countries have various QCT options enshrined within their laws 2, {{it is not clear}} if there are any guidelines 3 advising various professionals on the effective use of these measures. The aim of the survey was to provide an overview of existing guidelines on QCT disposals for adult <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders</b> within 35 Member States of the Council of Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{criminal}} justice system is often viewed as a revolving door for <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders</b> due to its failure to recognize the association between addiction and offending, and repeated incarceration of <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders</b> has contributed to prison overcrowding. The authors evaluated the effectiveness of Pennsylvania’s drug and alcohol treatment-based intermedi-ate punishment, Restrictive Intermediate Punishments (RIP/D&A), at {{reducing the risk of}} rearrest. Rearrest was compared at 12, 24, and 36 months postrelease. Offenders who successfully completed treatment had a lower risk of rearrest than tradi-tionally sentenced offenders in general and county jail and probation offenders specifically. However, offenders sentenced to RIP/D&A who did not successfully complete treatment were more at risk for rearrest than traditionally sentenced offenders in general. Also, offenders sentenced to state incarceration had a lower risk of rearrest than RIP/D&A participants, regardless of program completion...|$|R

This article draws on qualitative data from in-depth interviews with professionals and those mandated to treatment by the courts to assess the uses and limitations of two defining features of court-ordered drug treatment in Britain and elsewhere – drug testing and court review hearings – as a means of promoting and monitoring compliance with the conditions of these disposals...|$|R

The design of this study comprises a pre and post measurement of the criminal activity, drug use and situation in different spheres of life of 565 <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders.</b> Two conclusions can be drawn. First, after an alternative sanction or measure is imposed, there is a reduction in the criminal activity of the offender.

40|$|Coercion is controversial. The idea {{of using}} the legal system to get drug users into {{treatment}} tends to polarise debate between those who present it {{as a solution to}} drug-related crime, and others who see it as an abuse of human rights and of the relationship between client and therapist. Protagonists in this debate tend to talk past each other, with their different emphases on crime and civil liberties. In this editorial, we attempt to test these arguments, in the hope of moving the debate beyond mutual incomprehension. Our discussion builds on work we have done for the QCT Europe project, a six-country study of the use of quasi-compulsory treatment for <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders</b> (see www. kent. ac. uk/eiss/projects/qct-europe/) ...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the rapid}} {{expansion}} of options to coerce <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders</b> into treatment - culminating recently in the provisions of the Drugs Act 2005 and the government’s ‘Tough Choices’ agenda - research findings to date are equivocal about their impact in reducing crime. This paper presents UK findings from a pan-European study on this issue. The results – at both national and international levels - reveal that court-mandated clients reported significant and sustained reductions in illicit drug use and offending behaviours, and improvements in other areas of social functioning. Those entering the same treatment services through non-criminal justice routes also reported similar reductions and improvements. The implications of these findings are discussed in the context of recent policy developments...|$|R

40|$|Drug {{offences}} require adequate {{responses from}} the criminal justice system. In most Western European countries, including Belgium, the use of judicial alternative sanctions for drug users is on the increase. The objective of the current research {{was to examine the}} effects of judicial alternatives for drug users in Belgium. The design of this study comprises a pre and post measurement of the criminal activity, drug use and situation in different spheres of life of 565 <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders.</b> Reduced offending was observed following the application of alternative sanctions. On average, the research subjects incurred fewer criminal charges and convictions after the judicial alternative than prior to it. In addition, their involvement in drug offences, property and violent crime decreased. This covaries with a remarkable reduction in problematic drug use and an improvement in other aspects of their life including more supportive social relations and prosocial leisure time...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} three years drug courts have been adopted in several Australian jurisdictions to deal with <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders.</b> The first {{specialist}} drug court to be piloted in Australia commenced in 1999 after the New South Wales parliament passed legislation governing the NSW Drug Court Trial. The NSW Drug Court was broadly modelled on the drug courts which had been operating in the United States of America since the late 1980 ’s. The present report is part of a series of studies conducted by the NSW Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research evaluating the NSW Drug Court Trial. Other reports in this series monitor key aspects of the Drug Court’s operation, examine its cost-effectiveness in reducing re-offending compared with conventional criminal justice sanctions and investigate changes in {{the health and well-being of}} Drug Court participants. This report presents the results of a process evaluation of the Drug Court Trial designed to describe the operation of the Court, identify any problems it encountered and describe how these problems were resolved. Process evaluations are, by definition, not directly concerned with outcomes. They are...|$|R
40|$|This {{report has}} been {{compiled}} as an exploratory review of specialty court programs operating in Australia. It aims {{to document the}} establishment, operation and effectiveness of these programs {{in an effort to}} improve understanding about where they exist, how they function and whether they are successful. This review was supported by a national audit of specialty court programs conducted in conjunction with each Australian state and territory and the Criminology Research Council. The audit identified 19 programs operating across Australia as at 31 December 2004. Of these: • nine were developed for dealing with <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders</b> • six were developed as alternative sentencing options for Indigenous offenders • three were established for dealing with the incidence and perpetrators of family and domestic violence • one program targeted offenders with a mental impairment. Chronology The first specialty court to begin operation was the South Australian Family Violence Court in 1997. This was followed in 1999 by the New South Wales Adult Drug Court and South Australian Mental Impairment and Indigenous Courts. The most recently established specialty court programs were the Northern Territory’...|$|R

40|$|Every £ 100 {{invested}} in drug treatment services prevents a crime being committed, {{according to a}} study released today. A report published by the UK- basd NTA estimates that current drug treatment provision prevents 4. 9 million crimes in England a year, with an estimated saving to society of £ 960 million in costs to the public, business, the criminal justice system and the NHS. The findings in 'Estimating the Crime Reduction Benefits of Drug Treatment and Recovery' are based on statistics from the National Drug Treatment Monitoring System (NDTMS), conviction records from the Police National Computer, and self-reported offences data from the Drug Treatment Outcomes Research Study. The empirical analysis has been endorsed by the Home Office. The report estimates that the average cost of crime for a dependent drug user would be £ 26, 074 every year if they were not in treatment, and that treatment prevents 26 offences for every offender in effective treatment. The overall reduction in crime by 4. 9 million a year translates into an estimated: • 100, 000 fewer burglaries and robberies, saving homes and businesses £ 605 million • 75, 000 fewer car thefts and break-ins, saving motorists and businesses £ 155 million • 350, 000 fewer acts of prostitution • 1. 1 million fewer shoplifting thefts, saving retailers and businesses £ 137 million • 25, 000 fewer bags snatched. The report estimates that these benefits will accrue each year if funding for drug treatment continues at current levels. In addition, it estimates that the accumulated effect of more people sustaining recovery would prevent a further 4. 1 million offences over the next nine years. Central support for drug treatment in England is being maintained at £ 466. 7 m for 2012 - 13, although a recent report from the UK Drug Policy Commission warned that local authorities who supply additional local resources are under pressure. Paul Hayes, NTA Chief Executive, said: "It is well-established that getting <b>drug-dependent</b> <b>offenders</b> into and through treatment cuts crime. Now we can confidently estimate how much that is worth to the taxpayer, to individuals and to society, {{in terms of the number}} of crimes reduced and money saved. "When recovery from addiction is sustained, the benefits to society multiply, and with more users than ever completing treatment successfully and not returning, it makes sense to continue investing in evidence-based drug treatment locally. " Reducing drug-related crime is one of the objectives of the Government's Drug Strategy, as the Home Office estimates that between a third and a half of all acquisitive crimes are committed by heroin or crack cocaine addicts. The NTA report estimates that when not in treatment, every drug user commits an average of two crimes a week...|$|R
