50|$|The Peilgondel was {{developed}} by Paul Jaray {{to act as a}} heavy plumbbob for an airship's radio antenna.

5|$|While many {{versions}} of the tale exist, Ila is usually described as a daughter or son of Vaivasvata Manu and thus the sibling of Ikshvaku, {{the founder of the}} Solar Dynasty. In versions in which Ila is born female, she changes into a male form by divine grace soon after her birth. After mistakenly entering a sacred grove as an adult, Ila is either cursed to change his/her gender every month or cursed to become a woman. As a woman, Ilā married Budha, the god of the planet Mercury and the son of the lunar deity Chandra (Soma), and bore him a son called Pururavas, the father of the Lunar dynasty. After the birth of Pururavas, Ilā is transformed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> again and fathered three sons.|$|E
5|$|The dragon was {{regarded}} as a great lover and seducer of beautiful women, whom he visited by night, entering their houses down the chimney before turning <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man.</b> The women who were visited by a dragon would after a while grow weak, pale and sunken-faced. There were magical methods to repel the dragon from them. It was believed that the children born out of such liaisons were physically and mentally ill, and that they would not live long. In another belief, the dragon would come for his son amidst thunder and lightning, and fly away with him. In the region of Bitola, it was told that such children were born with a tail. After they grew wings, they flew into the sky, from where they shot witches with thunderbolts. There was a belief in the region of Leskovac that the dragon boys, fighters against ale born with the little wings, were offspring of dragons. At the village of Kruševo, Macedonia, people told of an old shepherd named Trail who was a son of a dragon. He was allegedly so strong that he could shatter cliffs, and when he shouted, his voice could be heard from miles away.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Ila, a king cursed by Shiva and Parvati to {{be a man}} one month and a woman the next, appears in several {{traditional}} Hindu texts. After changing sex, Ila loses the memory of being the other gender. During one such period, Ila marries Budha (the god of the planet Mercury). Although Budha knows of Ila's alternating gender, he doesn't enlighten the 'male' Ila, who remains unaware of his life as a woman. The two live together as man and wife only when Ila is female. In the Ramayana version, Ila bears Budha a son, although in the Mahabharata Ila is called both mother and father of the child. After this birth the curse is lifted and Ila is totally changed <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who goes on to father several children with his wife.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the Indiana and Michigan Electric Company {{purchased}} the rights along the East Race canal and began filling it in around 1954. In 1973 the Oliver Chilled Plow Works hydro-electric plant was demolished {{to make room}} for the construction of the Century Center which was completed in 1977. Currently the West Race still exists as a canal North of Jefferson Boulevard and South of Colfax Avenue on the banks of Century Center between Pier Park and Island Park. In the early 1980s, the East Race canal was re-excavated and turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> made whitewater kayaking course known as the East Race Waterway.|$|E

25|$|When he was 11 years old, Plenty Coups had {{a second}} vision {{involving}} the Little People, one that changed the fate of his entire tribe. Plenty Coups' family had moved to be with other bands of Crow lodging in the Beartooth Mountains. All the young men were challenged {{to go into the}} hills to seek visions, and Plenty Coups did so. Plenty Coups walked for two days (fasting as he went) and entered the Crazy Mountains, but had no vision. He returned a few days later with three friends, fasted, and took sweat-baths. He decided to cut off the tip of his left index finger as an offering to the spirits. That night, he dreamt of the chief of the Little People again. The chief introduced Plenty Coups to a buffalo that turned <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> with buffalo-like features (the buffalo-man), who led him underground and down a tunnel or path toward the Pryor Mountains. For two days, he traveled underground among throngs of American bison. Finally, the buffalo-man showed Plenty Coups a vision of endless streams of bison coming out of {{a hole in the ground}} but disappearing. Then a second stream of bison—with different colors (even spots), tails, and sounds—came up out of the ground, and remained on the plains. Plenty Coups had a vision of himself as an old man lodged near the Medicine Rocks, and of a vast forest whose trees had been felled by a great wind. Only a chickadee remained. A voice told Plenty Coups that the day of the Plains Indian was ending, and that white men would swarm over the land like buffalo. But the chickadee remains, because it is a good listener, develops its mind, and survives by its wits.|$|E

500|$|According {{to popular}} {{historian}} Arthur Herman, Murrow's staff edited {{the film to}} show McCarthy behaving in an unflattering [...] way. Herman quotes John Cogley of Commonweal, a McCarthy critic, as stating, [...] "A totally different selection of film would turn McCarthy <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> on a shining white steed—infinitely reasonable, burdened with the onus of single-handedly cleaning out subversives {{in the face of}} violent criticism."

500|$|Palmer {{felt that}} the {{characters}} of Marston and Williamson represented siblings in their former gang, while Dutch {{was more of a}} parental figure. He stated that Williamson is envious of Marston, despite Marston being his [...] "moral anchor". Palmer also felt that, after Marston left the gang, Williamson's life began to [...] "tailspin" [...] uncontrollably. [...] "s John grew <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who conquered by achieving, Bill fell <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> who achieved simply by conquering," [...] said Palmer. The character of Edgar Ross was partly inspired by lawyer and political activist Charles Joseph Bonaparte, while the in-game Mexican Revolution of Nuevo Paraíso was somewhat based on the Plan de San Diego. When developing other characters, the team was inspired by various historical figures of the 20th century, including Frank James, Pearl Hart and Tom Horn. In terms of the random non-player character (NPC) dialogue, Houser felt that Redemption sits between Bully, in which NPCs remember the protagonist, and Grand Theft Auto, in which NPCs are unaware of the protagonist's identity. [...] "here are countryside environments and people are to some extent bored so they're looking for thing to talk about so your actions get spoken about and people are aware of you more," [...] said Houser.|$|E

In one scene of this episode, Kenneth runs <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>man</b> named [...] "Moonvest", and tells him that he got {{an idea for a}} television game show, but Moonvest tells him [...] "Give me your fingernails".
