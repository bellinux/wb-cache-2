50|$|A virtual <b>data</b> <b>room</b> (sometimes {{called a}} VDR) is an online {{repository}} {{of information that}} {{is used for the}} storing and distribution of documents. In many cases, a virtual <b>data</b> <b>room</b> is used to facilitate the due diligence process during an M&A transaction, loan syndication, or private equity and venture capital transactions. This due diligence process has traditionally used a physical <b>data</b> <b>room</b> to accomplish the disclosure of documents. For reasons of cost, efficiency and security, virtual data rooms have widely replaced the more traditional physical <b>data</b> <b>room.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} of mergers and {{acquisitions}} the <b>data</b> <b>room</b> is set up {{as part of the}} central repository of data relating to companies or divisions being acquired or sold. The <b>data</b> <b>room</b> enables the interested parties to view information relating to the business in a controlled environment where confidentiality can be preserved. Conventionally this was achieved by establishing a supervised, physical <b>data</b> <b>room</b> in secure premises with controlled access. In most cases, with a physical <b>data</b> <b>room,</b> only one bidder team can access the room at a time. A virtual <b>data</b> <b>room</b> is designed to have the same advantages as a conventional <b>data</b> <b>room</b> (controlling access, viewing, copying and printing, etc.) with fewer disadvantages. Due to their increased efficiency, many businesses and industries have moved to using virtual data rooms instead of physical data rooms. In 2006, a spokesperson for a company which sets up virtual deal rooms was reported claiming that the process reduced the bidding process by about thirty days compared to physical data rooms.|$|E

50|$|In {{mergers and}} acquisitions, the {{traditional}} <b>data</b> <b>room</b> will literally be a physically secure continually monitored room, normally in the vendor’s offices (or {{those of their}} lawyers), which the bidders and their advisers will visit in order to inspect and report on the various documents and other data made available. Often only one bidder at a time {{will be allowed to}} enter and if new documents or new versions of documents are required these will have to be brought in by courier as hardcopy. Teams involved in large due diligence processes will typically have to be flown in from many regions or countries and remain available throughout the process. Such teams often comprise a number of experts in different fields and so the overall cost of keeping such groups on call near to the <b>data</b> <b>room</b> is often extremely high. Combating the significant cost of physical datarooms is the virtual <b>data</b> <b>room,</b> which provides for the secure, online dissemination of confidential information.|$|E
