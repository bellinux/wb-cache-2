40|$|AbstractThis paper {{provides}} {{the development of}} an axial suspended active magnetic bearing (AMB) experimental bench for load and <b>disturbance</b> <b>tests.</b> This test bench must be capable of levitating a 2 kg steel disc at a stable working distance of 3 mm and a maximum attraction distance of 6 mm. The suspension is accomplished by two electromagnets producing upward and downward attraction forces to support the steel disc. An inductive sensor measures the position of the steel disc and relays this to a PC based controller board (dSPACE® controller). The control system uses this information to regulate the electromagnetic force on the steel disc. The intent is to construct this system using relatively low-cost, low-precision components, and still be able to stably levitate the 2 kg steel disc with high precision. The dSPACE® software (ControlDesk®) was used for data acquisition. In this paper, an overview of the system design is presented, followed by the axial AMB model design, inductive sensor design, actuating unit design and controller development and implementation.

The liquid side in a packed absorption tower is chosen to illustrate the principles involved. The analysis of <b>disturbance</b> <b>testing</b> involves {{the evaluation of the}} moments of the resulting residence time distribution curves. It has in the past been found that this method often produces misleading results due to the magnification of experimental errors. An improved method of moment analysis is introduced in this work in an attempt to lessen this effect. It is also shown that much more useful information can be obtained by measuring the response to a disturbance at a number of selected positions in the bed rather than a single determination at the outlet from the column. Two mathematical models are chosen to describe the observed flow situation.

Power system dynamic {{simulation}} is {{an effective}} way to fully grasp the power system dynamic response, and it is also the basis guiding power system planning, design and operation.

The process depends on the pressurized steam and temperature that circulates through the materials inside a container. Some of the material is sensitive to high temperature where it could harm or alter the compound of the oil and it will decrease the therapeutic value of the essential oil. A proper temperature control technique is {{needed in order to}} maintain the suitable steam temperature to avoid an overheating of the material.

40|$|Heat {{transfer}} contributed {{in almost}} all processes in process industry. In contrast, mass transfer or chemical reaction can be dominant in some processes, while negligible importance in other processes. This major role of heat transfer underlines the importance of devices which function is to transfer heat {{into and out of}} a process. This device is a heat exchanger. Heat exchangers are used to transfer heat between two or more fluids, or between fluid and solid, which have opposite temperature to each other. Shell-and-tube heat exchangers (STHEs) are the most common types o f heat exchangers, covered about 60 % of all heat exchangers used. Temperature process systems especially Shell-and-Tube Heat Exchanger (STHE) have nonlinear characteristic which exhibit oscillatory and long dead-time behavior. Conventional P 1 D controller usually used for slow process such as temperature but having poor control in some specific process [...] Therefore, the main objective of this research is to design and control a new hybrid model reference adaptive fuzzy logic controller (MRAFLC) for temperature control problems in STHE system. In addition, the performances of this new design will be evaluated using certain performance criterion and these performances will be compared to the conventional PID controller and Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC). The designs of MRAFLC consist of two parts which are the FLC part and the model reference part. The design of FLC part consists o f the design of membership function (MF), design of rule bases and design of Fuzzy Inference Structure (FIS). The combination of FLC part and model reference using Gaussian MF and 7 x 7 rule bases for both parts has been chosen as the best MRAFLC designs. The MRAFLC performances have been evaluated during six different set point tests and two different load <b>disturbances</b> <b>tests.</b> These performances have been comparing with PID controller and FLC. The MRAFLC responses exhibit the lowest MO/MU for all set point tests ranging from no MO/MU until 35. 25 % MO/MU. In addition, MRAFLC responses have the most reduced cycles or oscillations as the minimum is zero cycle while the maximum is one cycle. An improved MRAFLC structure has been design to improve the MRAFLC design during set point test from 39 °C to 35 and 43 °C to 35 °C {{in order to have a}} MU within a desirable limit, which is below 20 %. This improved MRAFLC has lowered the MU to 12. 46 % and 10. 08 % respectively. For load <b>disturbances</b> <b>tests,</b> MRAFLC exhibits the lowest decay ratio during 10 % and 20 % load ranging from zero decay ratios to 13. 45 % as PID controller produce the highest decay ratio during both tests. The performances of MRAFLC has significantly importance during step down of 20 % load as it produce below 25 % of decay ratio whereas both PID controller and FLC exhibit response above 25 %, which is not desirable for a temperature control loop. In addition, MRAFLC produces shortest response time, lowest overshoot and less oscillation with one cycle when subjected to noise disturbances. All the findings indicate that the new design of MRAFLC not only improved the performance of conventional PID controller and FLC, but more importantly its performances are within a desirable limit for set point temperature change tests, load and noise <b>disturbances</b> <b>tests...</b>|$|R

In this dissertation, {{the author}} {{presents}} {{the operation and}} development of active magnetic bearings (AMBs), with specific focus on axial M s. The project objective {{is the development of}} an axial AMB system. The electromagnetic design, inductive sensor design, dSpace controller model design and actuating amplifier design are aspects discussed in this dissertation. The physical model constitutes two electromagnets positioned above and beneath a 2 kg steel disc with an air gap of 3 mm {{on either side of the}} disc. The electromagnetic design is done analytically and verified using Quickfield finite element analysis software. Inductive sensors are designed to obtain position feedback from the model. These sensors measure the distance of the air gap between the suspended steel disc and the electromagnets. The dSpace 1104 controller board and software is used for controlling purposes. This dissertation describes the system development from the Simulink model to the real-time model, where the dSpace controller board controls the physical hardware. The dSpace controller sends out control signals via DIA ports to actuating amplifiers. The actuating amplifiers then provide a controlling current to the electromagnets. The steel disc is attracted or released according to the signal provided. The inductive position sensors provide feedback from the model via the AID port of the dSpace controller to close the control loop. The control performance of the model is evaluated through steady state analysis (static load test), dynamic disturbance analysis (downward <b>disturbance</b> <b>test)</b> and step response analyses (amplitude step response test). The step response analysis provide information about the time-to-peak, settling time, percentage overshoot, natural frequency, damping ratio, damping constant and stiffness of the model. The experimental results obtained agree with the expected theoretical norms. Future possible projects can be done on the improvement of the sensor (designing a sensor-less sensor), designing advanced control techniques for the axial AMB model by using the dSpace DS 1 104 controller and designing an axial AMB model for high speed applications.

40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the multiple steady state behavior, an important observation in numerical and experimental studies in natural ventilation systems. The-oretical models are developed and their applications in numerical simulations and ventilation controls are presented. In {{a system with}} multiple steady states, how the system reaches different steady states {{is determined by the}} initial values of the systems and the dynamical system characteristics of the system. Mathematical models are developed to model the dynamical system behavior of a series of ventilation systems, ranging from simple single-zone systems to complex systems with thermal mass. More importantly, we found that the system can transform from one steady state to another under sufficient perturbations (disturbances) when multiple steady states exist. A successful transition is determined by both the magnitudes and durations of the perturbations. The transition dynamics are found to be important in theoretical, computational, and control applications. For example, the actual stability of a mathematically (or locally) stable steady state is highly correlated to the minimum perturbation requirements for a state transition. If two indicative parameters-the minimum perturbation time and the minimum perturbation magnitude-are small for the system to transit from one steady state to another, a mathematically stable steady state can be unstable in actual conditions, where stochastic disturbances exist as "strong perturbations". Further, building thermal mass is also found to have significant impacts on the state transitions between the multiple steady states. With thermal mass, the state transition becomes more difficult to occur. The state transition dynamics can also be applied to numerical simulations. (cont.) We have developed a convenient dynamical simulation method to identify the possible steady states in buildings with complex geometries and test the stabilities of the obtained steady states. The method can determine nearly all the possible steady state the system may reach in a feasible range using different search methods; whether the steady states obtained are stable in an actual environment can also be determined by a <b>disturbance</b> <b>test</b> based on the transition dynamics between the multiple steady states. Further, the state transition dynamics can be strategically applied in hybrid ventilation controls. In the past, designers and engineers have viewed the multiple steady states as negative aspect of ventilation design and have been trying to avoid the multiple steady states as much as possible. In this study, we have developed positive applications of multiple steady states based on a dynamic state transition in real-time to enhance the ventilation efficiency of a hybrid ventilation system and to reduce the energy usage in buildings. A coupled multi-zone airflow and thermal program for transient entire building simulations is also developed in parallel with the study. With the understanding on the multiple steady state issues, the developed program has overcome a few non-trivial numerical problems reported in other similar simulation programs and has shown good numerical performance in coupled airflow and thermal analysis. The program is also used as a tool for identifying the multiple steady states in buildings with complex geometries and for testing the actual stabilities of the obtained steady states in real conditions. by Jinchao Yuan.

H 577 P BSE 2015 Lixxv, 212 pages :illustrationsCompared to chilled {{water-based}} large-scale central {{air conditioning}} (AlC) systems, direct expansion (DX) A/C systems are simpler in configuration, more energy efficient and generally cost less {{to own and}} maintain. Therefore, {{for the last few}} decades, DX A/C systems have found increasingly applications in buildings, particularly in small to medium-scale buildings. However, currently most DX A/C systems are equipped with single-speed compressors and fans, relying on on-off cycling to maintain indoor dry-bulb temperatures only. This results in an uncontrolled equilibrium indoor humidity and possible space over-cooling if indoor humidity level is to be maintained at an acceptable level. These will lead to a reduced level of thermal comfort for occupants, poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and low energy efficiency. The development of variable-speed (VS) technology has made the continuous control of compressor speed and supply fan speed in a DX A/C system more practical, paving the way for achieving simultaneous control of indoor air temperature and relative humidity using DX A/C systems. For a VS DX A/C system, varying its compressor speed and supply fan speed influences on its output sensible and latent cooling capacities, {{which is part of the}} operational characteristics of the VS DX A/C system. Previous extensive experimental studies demonstrated that inlet indoor air temperature and humidity would, however, have also influence on the operational characteristics of a VS DX A/C system, with the extent of influences to be further studied. On the other hand, different attempts have been made to develop control strategies for the simultaneous control of indoor air temperature and humidity using a VS DX A/C system. Each controller developed has however its inadequacy because of both the difficulties of accurately modeling the complex heat and mass transfer between the refrigerant and air in a DX evaporator, and the coupling effects for the control loops for air temperature and humidity. Recently, artificial intelligent control strategies have been widely applied to building heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. Among various artificial intelligent control strategies, fuzzy logic (FL) is promising for achieving improved control of HVAC systems, because FL is very useful when the processes under consideration are too complex to be analyzed by conventional quantitative techniques or when the available sources of information are interpreted qualitatively, inexactly or uncertainly. Furthermore, artificial neural network (ANN) has been proven to be powerful in modeling the dynamic performance of a nonlinear multivariable system without requiring a physical model. Therefore, the application of fuzzy logic or ANN, individually or jointly, helps address the issue of simultaneously controlling indoor air temperature and humidity using a VS DX A/C system. Therefore, in this Thesis, a study to further investigate the operational characteristics of a VS DX A/C system at different inlet air states, and to develop novel controllers that can simultaneously control indoor air temperature and humidity using a VS DX A/C system following fuzzy logic and ANN approaches is reported. The Thesis, first of all, begins with presenting an experimental study on the operational characteristics of a VS DX A/C system at six different inlet air states to the system, which is a follow-up investigation to a previous related experimental study but at only two inlet air states. The study results suggested that different inlet air states to a DX A/C system influenced the operational characteristic of the system, in terms of the Inherent Correlations (IC) between its output total cooling capacity (TCC) and equipment sensible heat ratio (E SHR). Therefore, a further data processing method was developed using regression, by which the ICs of the VS DX A/C system at non-test inlet air states can be predicted with adequate accuracy. This study has therefore, on one hand, provided a further detailed understanding of the operational characteristics of the DX A/C system, and on the other hand, paved way to developing advanced control strategies for indoor thermal environment (i. e., air temperature and humidity) based on the known or predicted ICs within the possible operating ranges of inlet air temperature and humidity to the DX A/C system. Secondly, this Thesis reports on the developments of two novel controllers as two different approaches to solve the same problem of simultaneously controlling indoor air temperature and humidity using a VS DX A/C system. For the first one, based on the obtained ICs of the VS DX A/C system, a novel ANN aided fuzzy logic controller, which combined the complementary merits of fuzzy logic controller and ANN modeling, was developed and experimentally validated. A novel control principle was proposed to decouple the temperature and humidity control loops by introducing two interim variables of sensible output cooling capacity and latent output cooling capacity of the VS DX A/C system. A fuzzy logic system was redesigned to simplify both its calculation and structure by using weights assigned to linguistic variables. To enable ANN models developed to be functional over the normal operational range of indoor air parameters, the obtained ICs of the VS DX A/C system were used for training and testing the ANN models. The novel controller developed was tested using the experimental VS DX A/C system. Both the command following tests and disturbance rejection tests showed that air dry-bulb and wet-bulb temperatures were properly controlled by the controller developed with satisfactory control performances in terms of control accuracy and sensitivity. However, on the other hand, the other controller developed was a novel PD-law based fuzzy logic controller (PFC). To weaken the coupling effect between two control loops, fuzzy logic was deployed. A PD law was used instead of a PID law in the PFC, which could help simplify not only calculation but also the structure of the PFC. The controller developed was also validated by carrying out the controllability tests, including the command following test, disturbance rejection test and the command following with <b>disturbance</b> <b>test,</b> with the experimental conditions covering the normal operational range of a VS DX A/C system. The experimental results of the controllability tests suggested that the novel PFC developed was also capable of realizing the simultaneous control of indoor air temperature and humidity satisfactorily, in terms of control accuracy and sensitivity. Thirdly, this Thesis presents the performance comparisons between the two developed novel controllers, using that of an ON / OFF controller as a benchmark for the VS DX A/C system, in terms of control performance and energy efficiency. Comparison experiments for the three controllers were carried out under different operating conditions using the VS DX A/C system. Both the merits and shortcomings of the developed novel controllers are reported. With this study reported in this Thesis, a better understanding of operational characteristics of a VS DX A/C system has been obtained. Furthermore, novel controllers based on fuzzy logic and ANN have been developed to address the simultaneous control of indoor air temperature and humidity using a VS DX A/C system. The outputs from this study can help improve occupants' thermal comfort level and indoor air quality and enhance the energy efficiency of VS DX A/C systems.

Model free or so called uncalibrated visual servoing {{does not need}} the system calibration (microscope-camera-micromanipulator) and {{the model of the}} observed scene. It is robust to parameter changes and <b>disturbances.</b> We <b>tested</b> its performance in point-to-point positioning and various trajectory following tasks. Experimental results validate the utility of model free visual servoing in microassembly tasks...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In the past, limited {{unsupported}} standing {{has been}} restored in patients with thoracic spinal cord injury through open-loop functional electrical stimulation of paralyzed knee extensor muscles {{and the support of}} intact arm musculature. Here an optimal control system for paralyzed ankle muscles was designed that enables the subject to stand without hand support in a sagittal plane. The paraplegic subject was conceptualized as an underactuated double inverted pendulum structure with an active degree of freedom in the upper trunk and a passive degree of freedom in the paralyzed ankle joints. Control system design is based on the minimization of a cost function that estimates the effort of ankle joint muscles via observation of the ground reaction force position, relative to ankle joint axis. Furthermore, such a control system integrates voluntary upper trunk activity and artificial control of ankle joint muscles, resulting in a robust standing posture. Figures are shown for the initial simulation study, followed by <b>disturbance</b> <b>tests</b> on an intact volunteer and several laboratory trials with a paraplegic person. Benefits of the presented methodology are prolonged standing sessions and {{in the fact that the}} subject is able to maintain voluntary control over upper body orientation in space, enabling simple functional standing.

30|$|In {{this paper}} we {{considered}} full observability, which means there are sufficient measurements from the system, {{and perhaps the}} effect is not pronounced due to this, or {{the simplicity of the}} algorithm for centralized control itself. This study however shows that the cyber system can affect the operation of the LV feeder, specifically as disturbances in the system losses and the node voltage magnitudes. Furthermore, the cyber system <b>disturbance</b> simulation <b>test</b> cases show the importance of considering a backup strategy for the centralized control in case the optimizer does not converge.|$|R

Based on the aerodynamic theory, a simplified model of a high frequency flapping UAV is presented and its average is calculated. Equivalence between the time varying and mean models is shown through averaging theory. Hence, a bounded non linear control, designed using the average model, {{is applied to the}} time varying system to drive the position and orientation to desired values. Finally, the robustness with respect to external <b>disturbances</b> is <b>tested...</b>|$|R

The simulation is performed using different values of crowbar resistances. The variations of rotor current, rotor speed, DC-link voltage, active power and reactive power of the wind farm are investigated. Also, a comparison between the conventional crowbar and the proposed crowbar protection techniques is investigated...|$|R

The method consists of a population of Auto-Disturbance-Rejection Controller(ARDC) that evolve towards an optimal controller {{through the use of}} a genetic algorithm(GA) in handling set point change of the system. The optimal controller is then applied to the robustness <b>tests</b> and <b>disturbance</b> rejection <b>tests.</b> The test results have proved that the method can estimate and compensate the plant perturbations of parameters and external disturbances in the control system, thus improve the transient response and control precision evidently...|$|R

It recommends two tests, one for problems involving positively correlated disturbances {{and one for}} negatively correlated <b>disturbances.</b> Both <b>tests</b> are most powerful invariant {{at a point in}} the alternative hypothesis parameter space that is determined by a function involving the sample size and the number of regressors. Selected bounds for the tests' significance points are tabulated and an empirical comparison of powers demonstrates the overall superiority of the new test for positively correlated moving average disturbances. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{frequent}} {{problem in}} physics and engineering {{is that of}} determining a mathematical model for the dynamic performance of a system. It is particularly useful {{to be able to}} make measurements which enable such a model to follow changes in the system dynamics in the course of normal operation. Linear control theory, although now being replaced by a more general approach, can still form the basis for such system analysis. Cross correlating signals from a linear process can give a great deal of information about the process dynamics without injecting any <b>test</b> <b>disturbances,</b> or, when <b>test</b> signals are possible, cross correlation can be used to recover dynamic information in the presence of considerable background noise. The use of specially constructed test signals can make cross correlation a powerful technique in the identification of dynamic systems...|$|R
40|$|Interpretation of {{laboratory}} {{tests in the}} characterization study of the Bothkennar clay required an assessment {{to be made of}} the effects of <b>disturbance</b> prior to <b>testing.</b> <b>Disturbance</b> is shown to have occurred as a result of tube sampling, sample transport and specimen preparation. The effects of disturbance in the clay are to reduce the mean effective stress in the sample and shrink the initial bounding surface. The consequences of these changes are illustrated for the case of unconsoli-dated undrained triaxial tests, undrained triaxial compression and extension tests after reconsolidation to in situ stress, and oedometer tests. Reduction in peak strength, stiffness, yield stress and post-yield compressibility are shown to be a consequence of disturbance. The evaluation of sample quality on the basis of strains during reconsolidation is examined...|$|R
40|$|A {{field study}} {{involving}} 25 flights into Atlantic tropical <b>disturbances</b> <b>tested</b> the principal hypotheses {{of a new}} model of tropical cyclogenesis, known as the marsupial paradigm. A longstanding challenge for hurricane forecasters, theoreticians, and numerical weather forecast systems is to distinguish tropical waves that will develop into hurricanes from tropical waves that will not. While tropical easterly waves occur frequently over the Atlantic and east Pacific, only a small frac-tion of these waves (~ 20 %; e. g., Frank 1970) evolve into tropical storms when averaged over the hurricane season. The problem was insightfully summarized by Gray (1998) : “It seems unlikely that the formation of tropical cyclones will be adequately understood until we more thoroughly document the physical differences between those systems which develop into tropical cyclones from those prominent tropical disturbances which have a favorable climatological and synoptic environment, look very much like they will develop but still do not. ” The formation of tropical cyclones (TCs) is one of the remaining mysteries of the atmosphere (Emanuel 2005). As for why it remains unsolved, after decades of research, it is unfortunately true that in situ ob-servations are lacking over remote tropical oceans. Recent years have seen several field campaigns aimed at understanding the science of tropical cyclone formation. These include the National Aeronautics an...|$|R
