5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was seen as {{more than just the}} simple renaming of an international tendency that was already in existence. It was argued that the Third International had now degenerated completely and was therefore {{to be seen as a}} counter-revolutionary organisation that would in time of crisis defend capitalism. Trotsky believed that the coming World War would produce a revolutionary wave of class and national struggles, rather as World War <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first confrontation {{between the government and}} the King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against the wishes of the government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives like his father, Albert <b>I,</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic while the government feared that the King was acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of the King was valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E
25|$|If I were {{to drink}} a quart of blood and, concealing what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> come to the {{emergency}} room of any hospital vomiting blood, the behavior of the staff would be quite predictable. If they labeled and treated me as having a bleeding peptic ulcer, I doubt that I could argue convincingly that medical science does not know how to diagnose that condition.|$|E

"That I could not, monsieur," [...] Jeanne {{broke in}} with a smile; [...] "and if I could I would not accept them from you. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> what <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> because <b>I</b> pitied your mother and you, and I am content that if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> broken the rules <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> it with a good purpose." ...|$|R

25|$|Baumeister {{and colleagues}} {{also note that}} volunteers disbelieving in free will are less capable of {{counterfactual}} thinking. This is worrying because counterfactual thinking ("If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> something different...") {{is an important part}} of learning from one's choices, including those that harmed others. Again, this cannot be taken to mean that belief in determinism is to blame; these are the results we would expect from increasing people's belief in fatalism.|$|E
25|$|In 592 {{his troops}} {{retrieved}} Singidunum, which was however {{to be lost}} to the Avars again. Smaller Roman units were involved in policing actions against Slavic raiders in Moesia, reestablishing lines of communication between the Roman cities. Maurice aimed to reestablish a sturdy defense line along the Danube river, as Anastasius <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> a century before. Furthermore, he intended to keep the Avars and Slavs off Balkan territory by counter-invading their homelands, so as to enable Roman troops to increase their pay by pillaging in hostile territory, making these campaigns more attractive.|$|E
500|$|Former Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was {{in exile}} in Doorn, Netherlands, was horrified by the purge. He said, [...] "What would people have said if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> such a thing?". Hearing {{of the murder of}} former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and his wife, he also commented, [...] "We have ceased to live under {{the rule of law and}} {{everyone}} must be prepared for the possibility that the Nazis will push their way in and put them up against the wall!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> for you, O'Moy?" [...] Wellington's slight figure {{stiffened}} perceptibly, {{his face}} and glance were cold and haughty. [...] "You mistake, I think, or else you did not hear. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> solely upon grounds of political expediency. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> no choice in the matter, {{and it was not}} to favour you, or out of disregard for my duty, as you seem to imagine, that I acted as I did." ...|$|R
500|$|... "It was {{the first}} film that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> with Ang that was all in English, and it's Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant — these great, great actors. When you get footage like that, you realise that your job is really not technical. It was my job to look at {{something}} that Emma Thompson had done and say, 'Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead.' And not only was I allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors, I was required to." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{identity}} of the Indians whom Fraser used as models is somewhat uncertain, as Fraser told various and not always consistent stories during the forty years he lived after designing the nickel. In December 1913, he wrote to Mint Director Roberts that [...] "efore the nickel was made <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> several portraits of Indians, among them Iron Tail, Two Moons, {{and one or two}} others, and probably got characteristics from those men in the head on the coins, but my purpose was not to make a portrait but a type." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I think if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me." [...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done." ...|$|E

5000|$|Additive and upward {{counterfactual}} thinking {{focuses on}} [...] "what else could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> to do well?". Subtractive and upward counterfactual thinking focuses on [...] "what shouldn't <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> so <b>I</b> could do well?". In contrast, an additive and downward scenario would be, [...] "If I went drinking last night as well, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> even worse", while a subtractive and downward scenario would be, [...] "if I didn't start studying two days ago, <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> <b>done</b> much worse".|$|R

500|$|Azaria did {{not expect}} to hear from the show again, but they {{continued}} to call him back, first to perform the voice of Chief Wiggum and then Apu Nahasapeemapetilon. He felt that, initially, [...] " [...] didn't seem too pleased with what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done...</b> was very exacting... was kind of impatiently directing me on the ABCs of comedy. But then, much to my surprise, he would still keep having me back every week. But each week, I {{thought it was going to}} be my last week because I really didn't think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> that well." [...] Nevertheless, by the show's second season he was performing multiple recurring voices and so was given a contract and made a permanent member of the main cast. Since he joined later than the rest of the cast, Groening still considered Azaria the [...] "new guy". In addition to Moe, Wiggum and Apu, Azaria provides the voices of Comic Book Guy, Carl Carlson, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Dr. Nick Riviera, Lou, Snake Jailbird, Kirk Van Houten, the Sea Captain, Superintendent Chalmers, Disco Stu, Duffman, the Wiseguy and numerous one-time characters. His co-star in The Simpsons, Nancy Cartwright, wrote that: [...] "The thing about Hank that I most remember is that he started out so unassuming and then, little by little, his abilities were revealed and his contributions to the show escalated. I realized Hank was going to be our breakaway star." ...|$|E
500|$|McQueen and MacGraw {{began an}} affair during production. She would {{eventually}} leave her husband Evans and become McQueen's second wife. Foster {{was worried that}} their relationship could have a potentially {{negative impact on the}} film by causing a [...] scandal. MacGraw got her start as a model, and her inexperience as an actress was evident on the set as she struggled with the role. According to Foster, the actress and Peckinpah got along well, but she was not happy with her performance: [...] "After we had completed The Getaway and I looked at what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> in it, I hated my own performance. I liked the picture, but I despised my own work." ...|$|E
500|$|Shea himself {{accepted}} the reassignment only reluctantly, feeling that [...] "it {{was as if}} NASA was trying to hide me from the Congress for what I might have said". Once in the job, he grew increasingly dissatisfied with a posting that he {{considered to be a}} [...] "non-job", later commenting that [...] "I don't understand why, after everything <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> for the program... I was only one that was removed. That's {{the end of the program}} for me." [...] Only six months after the fire, and some two months after taking his new position, Shea left NASA in order to become a Vice President at the Polaroid Corporation in Waltham, Massachusetts. He had not been called to testify before the congressional inquiry into the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... 'What {{is there}} to laugh at?' said Mr. Dusautoy, putting on a look between merriment and simplicity. 'What else could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done?</b> <b>I</b> should <b>have</b> <b>done</b> the same whoever <b>I</b> <b>had</b> met.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, has he not? What could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done?</b> What ought <b>I</b> to <b>have</b> <b>done?</b> Tell me, Mr. Harcourt. It distresses me beyond {{measure that}} you should think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been to blame." ...|$|R

500|$|Laucke took up snooker, {{and became}} {{competent}} enough by age thirteen {{to gain a}} job as a demonstrator for the Brunswick Corporation, a snooker table manufacturer. Laucke learned billiards from George Chenier, a fellow Montrealer and the North American snooker champion. The two faced each again four years later at the North American snooker championships in Montreal, where Laucke won the championship. Laucke recalled: [...] "Then I decided to leave snooker, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> what I wanted to do... My love for the guitar was overwhelming. There was a lot more money in snooker, but snooker was just a passion, and music was my love." [...] Laucke used his snooker winnings to finance 110trips from Montreal to New York City to study the classical guitar with Franco-Spaniard Rolando Valdés-Blain.|$|E
500|$|... the Lord Robert's wife brake {{her neck}} at Forster's house in Oxfordshire … her gentlewomen being gone forth to a fair. Howbeit {{it was thought}} she was slain, for Sir ----- Varney was there that day and whylest the deed was doing was going over the fair and tarried there for his man, who at length came, and he said, thou knave, why tarriest thou? He answered, should I come before <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done?</b> Hast thou done? quoth Varney. Yeah, quoth the man, I have made it sure. … Many times before it was bruited by the Lord Robert his men that she was dead. … This Verney and divers his {{servants}} used before her death, to wish her death, which made the people to suspect the worse.|$|E
500|$|On November 27, 1956, he {{fled from}} Budapest to Austria with {{his future wife}} Enid, his sister, brother-in-law, {{and a few others}} after the Soviets invaded the city. He had no prior {{intention}} to leave Hungary until he learned from his mother that the Hungarian Secret Police were looking for him. Racz said if they found him, [...] "That would have meant the end of my dreams to become a doctor. Perhaps I would have ended up in prison. Not that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> anything but many other people ended up in prison following 1956 without committing any crime." [...] He arrived in the Austrian town of Eisenstadt where buses were waiting to take refugees to their new homes. Racz chose the bus to England, and he along with his family and other members of his group were transported to a military base in the Midlands.|$|E
6000|$|Then Gudruda spoke: [...] "Strange tales {{are told}} of thee and Eric, Groa's daughter! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with Eric, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>done</b> with thee also. Thou hast thrust thyself here {{against my will}} and, if I may, I would see thy face no more." ...|$|R

500|$|Recording {{sessions}} for the film's songs and soundtrack began on October 2, 1995, at CTS Studios in London. It took almost {{four months to}} record all the songs, which involved creating the music first and then the lyrics. Parker declared {{the first day of}} recording as [...] "Black Monday", and recalled it as a worrisome and nervous day. He said, [...] "All of us came from very different worlds—from popular music, from movies, and from musical theater—and so we were all very apprehensive." [...] The cast was also nervous; Banderas found the experience [...] "scary", while Madonna was [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to recording the songs. [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber... I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> a terrible job", the singer recalled.|$|E
500|$|According to the singer, she {{was very}} nervous during {{the first day of}} recording. She {{allegedly}} found herself [...] "petrified" [...] when it came to doing the song; [...] "I had to sing 'Don't Cry For Me Argentina' in front of Andrew Lloyd Webber [...] I was a complete mess and was sobbing afterward. I thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done</b> a terrible job", she recalled. The final version recorded had much similarities to the original version by Covington, although had a much faster pace and was created as an orchestral pop to cater to the contemporary music scene. According to the sheet music published by Musicnotes.com, Madonna's version of the song is set in common time, with a slow groove tempo of 90 beats per minute. Madonna's vocals on the song span from G3 to C5. The song follows a basic sequence of C–F–C when Madonna sings [...] "It won't be easy, you'll think it strange", and changes to G7–C on the second verse.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written [...] "I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company". When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse rubbing his load against the rocks {{to get rid of it}} … I told them what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>done,</b> and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol." [...] Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.|$|E
