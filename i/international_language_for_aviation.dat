40|$|System {{complexity}} {{is a key}} characteristic {{in aviation}} industry which leads to broad utilization of modeling and simulation in in this global business. Scenario development is {{an important aspect of}} a simulation study. It starts at the very first steps when the operational scenarios are defined with the stakeholders and ends with a successful simulation execution. Although the importance of simulation scenarios has long been well-known, there still exists a lack of common understanding and standardized practices which lead to degraded interoperability and shareability. There is a recent effort coordinated by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Modeling and Simulation Technical Committee (MSTC) towards development of a standard scenario definition <b>language</b> <b>for</b> <b>aviation.</b> This effort is being challenged by the same system complexity.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} some of {{the ways}} in which mathematics was considered as a language around 1900. In the first part of the paper aspects of the creation of an <b>international</b> <b>language</b> <b>for</b> mathematics are considered, and discussed as part of the wider political movements <b>for</b> <b>international</b> <b>languages.</b> This sheds a new light on the multi-national, rather than international, nature of mathematical community. In the second half of the paper the linguistic perspective is used to provide a new view on contemporary debates about the foundations of mathematics. A wide variety of positions were taken about the correct relationship between thought, language, logic, mathematics and the world, sometimes with an intensity that can only be explained on historical and political grounds. The simultaneous searches <b>for</b> a truly <b>international</b> <b>language</b> and <b>for</b> an appropriate <b>language</b> <b>for</b> mathematics with an appropriate foundation not only involved several of the same people, but each raised difficult questions of syntax, semantics, and the relation between syntax and semantics. The paper concludes with some reflections on Hilbert’s philosophy of mathematics, which allowed for multiple interpretations. A number of reasons are given to suggest that it is possible to speak of a distrust of language at the time, and that shifting the emphasis from logic to language allows us to recognise confusions about difficult linguistic issues which deepen our understanding of the old debates about the relationship of logic to mathematics...|$|R

Moreover, people who keep business relation with people from different countries with different languages, use English to communicate among them. In addition, international TV programs are presented in English. Furthermore, tourists who visit different countries from any part of the world know English a mother tongue or as a second language. So it is clear that English is being used all over the globe. Because of the increase of the use of English language in the world, it is of huge importance for all new generations to learn English as a second language. Usually employees are required to speak English as a second language. So peoples who attempt to get a good job need to learn the <b>international</b> <b>language.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, English is being taught in almost all levels of the educational systems; however; the students usually do not achieve the competences established for each level of the educational systems. Consequently, it is necessary to apply efficient strategies in the classroom to improve the teaching- learning process of English.

This aim {{is in line with}} the development of science and technology in the globalization era, in which the role of the Indonesian language as a mean of personal development is inevitably challenged by the rapid changes and the need of <b>international</b> <b>languages.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, it is worried that learners face any negative wash back of the existence of <b>International</b> <b>language,</b> in instance, the lost of their own identity. To this end, the role of Indonesian teaching is getting more and more obviously important. In reality, however, the Indonesian teaching is generally assumed as the easiest subject if it is compared with other subjects. As a result of this case, learners pretend not to learn Indonesian seriously. Ironically, many students get low grade although the Indonesian lesson is seen easily to learn. In fact, elementary school (SD/MI) is regarded as basis for the formation of the noble values of the nation. The study had identified several sources of problems in learning Indonesian both from the educators or learners. Besides, it was revealed that the result of learning was affected by some aspects, such as the goals, materials, methods, school facilities and infrastructure...|$|R
