5|$|Placing {{the engines}} within the wings had the {{advantage}} of a reduction in the risk of <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage,</b> which could seriously damage jet engines. The low-mounted engines and good placement of service panels also made aircraft maintenance easier to perform. However, the Comet's buried engine configuration increased its structural weight and complexity. Armour had to be placed around the engine cells to contain debris from any serious engine failures; also, placing the engines inside the wing required a more complicated wing structure.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 was envisioned to {{fly from}} forward air bases and semi-prepared runways with {{high risk of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> to the engines. The unusual {{location}} of the General Electric TF34-GE-100 turbofan engines decreases ingestion risk, and allows the engines to run while the aircraft is serviced and rearmed by ground crews, reducing turn-around time. The wings are also mounted closer to the ground, simplifying servicing and rearming operations. The heavy engines require strong supports: four bolts connect the engine pylons to the airframe. The engines' high 6:1 bypass ratio contributes to a relatively small infrared signature, and their position directs exhaust over the tailplanes further shielding it from detection by infrared homing surface-to-air missiles. The engines and exhausts are angled upward by nine degrees to cancel out the nose-down pitching moment that would otherwise generate from being mounted above the aircraft's center of gravity and avoids the need to trim the control surfaces to prevent pitching.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} a {{preliminary}} data set including experimental results from fatigue tests on smooth and <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damaged</b> (FOD) aluminium samples coated with WC/C deposited with PVD (physical vapour deposition) technique was considered before testing WC/C-coated spur gears for racing motorcycles under rolling contact fatigue (RCF). The fatigue behaviour {{of the samples}} was correlated with the results obtained with the RCF tests on the coated gears. A special device mounted on a universal testing machine was used {{to carry out the}} RCF tests...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effect of}} a {{physically}} vapor deposited (PVD) WC/C coating on the fatigue behavior of as produced and <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damaged</b> (FOD) solution heat treated and aged 7075 aluminum alloy was studied. Coated and uncoated samples were tested under rotating bending to determine the fatigue strengths between 104 and 106 cycles in both damaged and smooth condition. FOD was produced with single shots of small hard steel spheres impacting at 100 m/s in the minimum cross section. SEM was used to characterize {{the features of the}} fracture surfaces...|$|R
25|$|There were 110 class A {{accidents}} in the 25 years that Canada operated the CF-104 resulting in 37 pilot fatalities. Most {{of these were}} {{in the early part}} of the program centering on teething problems. Of the 110 class A accidents 21 were attributed to <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> (14 of which were birds), 14 were in flight engine failures, 6 were faulty maintenance, 9 were mid air collisions. 32 struck the ground flying at low level in poor weather conditions. Of the 37 fatalities 4 were clearly attributable to systems failures, all of the others were attributable to some form of pilot inattention.|$|E
25|$|The wing also {{incorporated}} {{changes for}} improved aerodynamics. The engines' accessory gearbox was {{moved from the}} 6 o'clock position under the engine to the 4 o'clock position (from a front/forward looking aft perspective). This side-mounted gearbox gives the engine a somewhat triangular rounded shape. Because the engine {{is close to the}} ground, 737-300s and later models are more prone to engine <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> (FOD). The improved CFM56-7 turbofan engine on the 737 Next Generation is 7% more fuel-efficient than the previous CFM56-3 in the 737 classics. The newest 737 variants, the 737 MAX family, are to feature CFM International LEAP-1B engines with a 1.73 m fan diameter. These engines are expected to be 10-12% more efficient than the CFM56-7B engines on the 737 Next Generation family.|$|E
25|$|The PC-24 {{is powered}} by a pair of Williams FJ44-4A {{turbofan}} engines. A unique feature of the FJ44-4A powerplant is the Quiet Power Mode; in addition to providing thrust and main power, standby power is also drawn from the main engines in Quiet Power Mode, in place of a separate auxiliary power unit (APU). An additional 5 per cent is available via an Automatic Thrust Reserve feature. The engines are mounted on the upper portion of the rear fuselage to prevent <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> (FOD) during operations at rough airstrips. Other FOD-reduction measures include the enlarged flaps and chines on the nose wheel of the landing gear. The exhaust ducts of the engines feature an aerodynamic modification, having been shaped so the outflow contributes to the thrust vector during takeoff, reducing the takeoff roll distance.|$|E
40|$|As part of NASAs focused {{technology}} {{programs for}} future reusable launch vehicles, a task is underway {{to study the}} feasibility of using the polymer matrix composite feedlines instead of metal ones on propulsion systems. This is desirable to reduce weight and manufacturing costs. The task consists of comparing several prototype composite feedlines made by various methods. These methods are electron-beam curing, standard hand lay-up and autoclave cure, solvent assisted resin transfer molding, and thermoplastic tape laying. One of the critical technology drivers for composite components is resistance to <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> <b>damage.</b> This paper presents results of an experimental study of the damage resistance of the candidate materials that the prototype feedlines are manufactured from. The materials examined all have a 5 -harness weave of IM 7 as the fiber constituent (except for the thermoplastic, which is unidirectional tape laid up in a bidirectional configuration). The resin tested were 977 - 6, PR 520, SE-SA- 1, RS-E 3 (e-beam curable), Cycom 823 and PEEK.

25|$|During the Vietnam War, the CH-46 {{was one of}} {{the prime}} US troop {{transport}} helicopters in the theatre, slotting between the smaller Bell UH-1 Iroquois and larger Sikorsky CH-53 Sea Stallion. During the 1972 Easter Offensive, Sea Knights saw heavy use to convey US and South Vietnamese ground forces to and around the front lines. CH-46 operations were plagued by major technical problems; the engines, being prone to <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> (FOD) from debris being ingested when hovering close to the ground and subsequently suffering a compressor stall, had a lifespan as low as 85 flight hours; on 21 July 1966, all CH-46s were grounded until more efficient filters had been fitted. By the end of US military operations in Vietnam, over a hundred Sea Knights had been lost to enemy fire.|$|E
2500|$|The C-17 {{is powered}} by four Pratt & Whitney F117-PW-100 {{turbofan}} engines, {{which are based on}} the commercial Pratt and Whitney PW2040 used on the Boeing 757. Each engine is rated at [...] of thrust. The engine's thrust reversers direct engine exhaust air upwards and forward, reducing the chances of <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> by ingestion of runway debris, and providing enough reverse thrust to back the aircraft up on the ground while taxiing. The thrust reversers can also be used in flight at idle-reverse for added drag in maximum-rate descents. In vortex surfing tests performed by C-17s, up to 10% fuel savings were reported.|$|E
2500|$|The Skyknight {{played an}} {{important}} role in the development of the radar-guided AIM-7 Sparrow missile which led to further guided air-to-air missile developments. It also served as an electronic warfare platform in the Vietnam War as a precursor to the EA-6A Intruder and EA-6B Prowler. The aircraft is sometimes unofficially called [...] "Skynight", dropping the second [...] "k". The unusual, portly profile earned it the nickname [...] "Willie the Whale". Some Vietnam War U.S. Marine veterans have referred to the Skyknight as [...] "Drut", whose meaning becomes obvious when read backwards. This may be in reference to its age, unflattering looks or its low-slung air intakes that made it vulnerable to <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> (FOD).|$|E
40|$|Most {{structures}} made of laminated {{polymer matrix}} composites (PMCs) must {{be designed to}} some damage tolerance requirement that includes <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> impact <b>damage.</b> Thus {{from the beginning of}} a part s life, impact damage is assumed to exist in the material and the part is designed to carry the required load with the prescribed impact damage present. By doing this, some processing defects may automatically be accounted for in the reduced design allowable due to these impacts. This paper will present examples of how a given level of impact damage and certain processing defects affect the compression strength of a laminate that contains both. Knowledge of the impact damage tolerance requirements, before processing begins, can broaden material options and processing techniques since the structure is not being designed to pristine properties...|$|R
40|$|Refractory ceramic {{materials}} such as zirconium diborides (ZrB 2) have been excellent candidate materials for application in turbine blades, leading edge surfaces of high mach aircraft and high temperature applications. This is due to their good strength at high temperatures (T 3 ̆e 1800 °C). But questions on their ultimate durability at such temperatures remains an issue, especially with respect to <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> impact <b>damage</b> as well as oxidation. Little characterization of such materials of the impact durability of such materials at very high temperatures has been performed - In this talk an experimental approach for the impact testing of {{ceramic materials}} at elevated temperatures is presented. In this investigation laser sintered specimens of ZrB 2 are impacted with energies 111 J - 194 J at temperatures ranging from 500 °C to 2000 °C. At these temperatures {{it is evident that}} the materials exhibit a degree of ductility. In addition, an approach for using such experiments to calibrate explicit finite element simulations is also presented. ...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the most}} {{critical}} flaws encountered during the service life of a composite component can result from impact <b>damage</b> due to <b>foreign</b> <b>objects</b> (FOD). Impact <b>damage</b> can produce significant degradation of the material’s structural integrity. Destructive sectioning [1] or de-plying [2, 3] of impact damaged laminates has proven that damage is manifested in the form of interlaminar delaminations, each of different size, shape and ply interface orientation through the thickness. Unfortunately, the extent of the delamination damage, especially at low level impact sites, may not be visually identified from surface features. The seriousness of this problem has led to much work in both the nondestructive evaluation and mechanics communities to characterize and assess the effects of such damage...|$|R
2500|$|The F414 {{continues}} to be improved, both through internal GE efforts and federally funded development programs. [...] By 2006 GE [...] had tested an Enhanced Durability Engine (EDE) with an advanced core. [...] The EDE engine provided a 15% thrust increase or longer life without the thrust increase. It has a six-stage high-pressure compressor (down from 7 stages in the standard F414) and an advanced high-pressure turbine. The new compressor should be about 3% more efficient. The new high-pressure turbine uses new materials and {{a new way of}} delivering cooling air to the blades. These changes should increase the turbine temperature capability by about 150°F (83°C). [...] The EDE is designed to have better <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> resistance, and a reduced fuel burn rate.|$|E
2500|$|However, in 1979 Pratt & Whitney {{launched}} its PW2000 engine, claiming 8% better fuel efficiency than the -535C for the PW2037 version. Boeing put Rolls-Royce {{under pressure to}} supply a more competitive engine for the 757, and using the more advanced -524 core as a basis, the company produced the [...] thrust RB211-535E4 which entered service in October 1984. While still not quite as efficient as the PW2037, it was more reliable and quieter. Visible differences include a mixed exhaust nozzle and a bigger fan cone. It {{was also the first}} to use the wide chord fan which increases efficiency, reduces noise and gives added protection against <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage.</b> As a result, {{a relatively small number of}} -535C's were installed on production aircraft, almost all -535Cs are still used with Boeing 757-200s owned by DHL and one aircraft is a charter jet. The majority uses the -535E.|$|E
2500|$|In March 2013, the U.S. Navy was {{considering}} the widespread adoption of conformal fuel tanks, {{which would allow}} the Super Hornet to carry [...] of additional fuel. Budgetary pressures from the F-35C Lightning II and Pacific region operations were cited as reasons supporting the use of CFTs. Flight testing demonstrated CFTs could slightly reduce drag while expanding the combat range by 260 nautical miles. The prototype CFT weighed 1,500lb, while production CFTs are expected to weigh 870lb. Boeing stated that the CFTs do not add any cruise drag but acknowledged a negative impact imposed on transonic acceleration due to increased wave drag. General Electric's enhanced performance engine (EPE), increasing the F414-GE-400's power output from 22,000lb to 26,400lb of thrust per engine, was suggested as a mitigating measure. In 2009, development commenced on several engine improvements, including greater resistance to <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> <b>damage,</b> reduced fuel burn rate, and potentially increased thrust of up to 20%.|$|E
50|$|Due to the accident, on August 25, the United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) ordered {{emergency}} {{inspections of}} wing leading-edge slat tracks on all Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft. The Emergency Airworthiness Directive (EAD) from the FAA requires operators {{to inspect the}} slat track downstop to check for missing parts, ensure proper installation, and check {{the inside of the}} slat can for <b>foreign</b> <b>object</b> debris and <b>damage.</b> The directive requires operators to inspect within 24 days and every 3000 flight cycles thereafter. Following feedback from completed inspections revealing loose parts in several other aircraft and one with a damaged slat can, the FAA issued a new emergency airworthiness directive on August 28. Airlines were then required to perform the inspection on Next Generation Boeing 737 aircraft within 10 days instead of 24 days. In addition, the AD required a one-time torquing of the nut and bolt in the downstop assembly for the slat track within 24 days.|$|R
40|$|Sandwich beams with {{composite}} faces {{sheets and}} foam core {{are widely used}} as lightweight components {{in many of the}} industries such as automotive, marine and aerospace applications due to its high bending stiffness and strength combined with low weight. Thus, it is important to gain knowledge of their flexural behavior under static as well as dynamic loads. Although extensive research has been devoted to the flexural behavior of composite laminates in general, the flexural behavior of sandwich structures is quite and obviously different. Several works treating the dynamic flexural behavior of sandwich beams have also confirmed the marked susceptibility of sandwich structures to damage caused by the low velocity impact of <b>foreign</b> <b>objects.</b> Impacts can <b>damage</b> the face sheets, the core material, and the core face interface. The type of damage usually found in the faces is similar to that observed after impacts on monolithic composites. However, the damage initiation thresholds and damage area depend on the properties of the core material and the relationship between the properties of the core and those of the face sheets. The modelling is done for sandwich beam with create volume option with dimensions known in the software...|$|R

[...] All those functions that on land would require wheeled ground support equipment had a need for a watercraft equivalent. Other vessels were equipped as high speed target tugs, pickets and for range safety. On the creation of the RAF, along with the seaplanes they served, these RNAS vessels and their crews would become the RAF's Marine Craft Section (MCS), However, the Navy was from the start opposed to and did its best to prevent the creation of the new service, of the vessels that were now theoretically part of the RAF some could not be found; others were carried aboard Royal Navy vessels that were not part of the RNAS transfer, and to which the RAF had no option but to acede to their transfer back to the Navy. The MCS officers tasked with carrying out an inventory of the new service's assets concluded that achieving the transfer of 323 vessels was possible.

40|$|The {{ability of}} gamma-TiAl to {{withstand}} potential <b>foreign</b> or domestic <b>object</b> <b>damage</b> is a technical {{risk to the}} implementation of gamma-TiAl in low pressure turbine (LPT) blade applications. In the present study, the impact resistance of TiAl alloy ABB- 2 was determined and compared to the impact resistance of Ti(48) Al(2) Nb(2) Cr. Specimens were impacted with four different impact conditions with impact energies ranging from 0. 22 to 6. 09 J. After impacting, the impact damage was characterized by crack lengths on both the front and backside of the impact. Due to the flat nature of gamma-TiAl's S-N (stress vs. cycles to failure) curve, step fatigue tests were used to determine the fatigue strength after impacting. Impact damage increased with increasing impact energy and led to a reduction in the fatigue strength of the alloy. For similar crack lengths, the fatigue strength of impacted ABB- 2 was similar to the fatigue strength of impacted Ti(48) Al(2) Nb(2) Cr, even though the tensile properties of the two alloys are significantly different. Similar to Ti(48) Al(2) Nb(2) Cr, ABB- 2 showed a classical mean stress dependence on fatigue strength. The fatigue strength of impacted ABB- 2 could be accurately predicted using a threshold analysis...|$|R

The overall {{purpose of the present study}} was to determine the influence of ballistic impact damage on the high cycle fatigue strength of gamma - TiAl simulated LPT blades. Impact and specimen variables included ballistic impact energy, projectile hardness, impact temperature, impact location, and leading edge thickness. The level of damage induced by the ballistic impacting was studied and quantified on both the impact (front) and backside of the specimens. Multiple linear regression was used to model the cracking and fatigue response as a function of the impact variables. Of the impact variables studied, impact energy had the largest influence on the response of gamma - TiAl to ballistic impacting. Backside crack length was the best predictor of remnant fatigue strength for low energy impacts (< 0. 74 J) whereas Hertzian crack length (impact side damage) was the best predictor for higher energy impacts. The impacted gamma - TiAl samples displayed a classical mean stress dependence on the fatigue strength. For the fatigue design stresses of a 6 th stage LPT blade in a GE 90 engine, a Ti- 48 Al- 2 Nb- 2 Cr LPT blade would survive an impact of normal service conditions...|$|R
