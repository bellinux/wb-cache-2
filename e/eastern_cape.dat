5|$|M. kaalae was {{described}} in 2009 {{on the basis of}} a partial skull from the Upper Elliot Formation in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> of South Africa. This species is known from the same time and region as some specimens of M. carinatus. It differs from the type species in the morphology of the braincase, as well as in several other characters of the skull such as the proportions of the premaxilla.|$|E

5|$|The Cape sparrow {{has three}} subspecies. The {{nominate}} subspecies Passer melanurus melanurus {{is found in}} eastern South Africa, east to {{the western part of}} Free State. The subspecies vicinus, which is sometimes included in subspecies melanurus, occurs from Free State east to <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> and Lesotho. The subspecies damarensis ranges from the extreme southern coastal areas of Angola into Namibia, Botswana and southern Zimbabwe, as well as northern South Africa.|$|E
5|$|A. b. caama (Saint-Hilaire, 1803) : Known {{as the red}} {{hartebeest}} or Cape hartebeest. Formerly {{occurred in}} southern Angola; northern and eastern savannahs of Namibia; central, southern and southwestern Botswana; Northern Cape, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape,</b> Western Cape, Free State, Northwest and Gauteng provinces and western KwaZulu-Natal of South Africa. Presently has been eliminated from all these areas except Northern Cape, central and southwestern Botswana and Namibia. Major re-introductions {{have taken place in}} these countries. The population of this hartebeest is on the rise.|$|E
5|$|After {{his arrest}} Biko {{was held in}} custody in Port Elizabeth, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> for several days, during which he was interrogated. During his {{interrogation}} he was severely beaten {{by some of the}} policemen questioning him. He suffered severe injuries, including his brain, and died soon after on 12 September 1977. News of his death spread quickly, and became a symbol of the abuses perpetrated under the apartheid government. Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E

5|$|Ernest Lucas Guest {{was born}} in Grahamstown, Cape Colony (in modern South Africa's <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> province) on 20 August 1882. Guest's {{grandfather}} had moved the family to South Africa in 1861 from Kidderminster, England, {{where they had been}} involved in the printing business for three generations. His grandfather was appointed manager of the Frontier Times, printed and published in Grahamstown. The family resided there until 1889 when Ernest's father, Herbert Melville Guest, moved them to Klerksdorp, Transvaal, after buying the local newspaper and printing business.|$|E
5|$|The Ipsos Pulse of the People survey {{undertaken}} in October and November 2013 {{showed that a}} number of provinces would be closely contested. The ANC will continue to dominate in the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape,</b> Limpopo, North West, Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and Free State. The DA will keep the Western Cape while control of the Northern Cape and Gauteng will be contested between the ANC and DA, with other parties holding the balance of power, so coalitions may be decisive. In Limpopo and North West the EFF could become the official opposition.|$|E
5|$|The {{red-headed}} myzomela {{closely resembles}} the scarlet myzomela, {{though there is}} only a small overlap in their respective ranges, in <b>eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> York Peninsula. The latter species lives in woodlands rather than mangroves. The dusky myzomela resembles the female red-headed myzomela, but is larger and darker brown, and lacks the red markings around the bill. The Sumba myzomela is similar but slightly smaller than the red-headed myzomela and has darker upper parts and a broad black pectoral band.|$|E

5|$|Various {{regions of}} Africa have folkloric tales of beings with vampiric abilities: in West Africa the Ashanti people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling asanbosam, and the Ewe {{people of the}} adze, which can {{take the form of}} a firefly and hunts children. The <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> region of South Africa has the impundulu, which can {{take the form of a}} large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail {{clippings}} of nobles.|$|E
5|$|Black {{wildebeest}} act as hosts to {{a number}} of external and internal parasites. A study of the animal in Karroid Mountainveld (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> Province, South Africa) revealed the presence of all the larval stages of the nasal bot flies Oestrus variolosus and Gedoelstia hässleri. The first instar larvae of G hässleri were found in large numbers on the dura mater of wildebeest calves, specially between June and August, and these later migrated to the nasal passages. Repeated outbreaks of mange (scab) have led to large-scale extinctions. The first study of the protozoa in blue and black wildebeest showed the presence of 23 protozoan species in the rumen, with Diplodinium bubalidis and Ostracodinium damaliscus common in all the animals.|$|E
5|$|Mandela's 90th {{birthday}} was marked {{across the country}} on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at Qunu, and a concert in his honour in Hyde Park, London. In a speech marking the event, Mandela called for the rich {{to help the poor}} across the world. Throughout Mbeki's presidency, Mandela continued to support the ANC, usually overshadowing Mbeki at any public events that the two attended. Mandela was more at ease with Mbeki's successor, Zuma, although the Nelson Mandela Foundation was upset when his grandson, Mandla Mandela, flew him out to the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> to attend a pro-Zuma rally {{in the midst of a}} storm in 2009.|$|E

5|$|The Natal {{red rock}} hare or greater red rock hare (Pronolagus crassicaudatus) is {{a species of}} mammal in the family Leporidae (rabbits and hares). It has a {{slightly}} grizzled, grayish brown head and reddish brown upperparts.The dense fur is thick and rougher than other rock hares. It is endemic to Africa, and found in southeastern provinces of South Africa (<b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape,</b> Mpumalanga, and KwaZulu-Natal), eastern Lesotho, Swaziland (Highveld and Lumbobo), and southern Mozambique (Maputo Province). It is aherbivore, primarily feeding on grass. It breeds throughout the year, {{and one or two}} pups are usually born in the summer. It is rated as a species ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific blue-eye {{is found}} from Narooma in {{southern}} New South Wales {{north to the}} Rocky River in Cape York, though it is uncommon in <b>eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> York. It lives in small, generally slow moving, streams to estuaries, as well as dune lagoons and salt marshes. It {{is also found in}} brackish and marine waters on some Queensland offshore islands such as Hinchinbrook Island, Lizard Island, Low Island and Dunk Island. It has been recorded as far as 300km (185mi) upstream in the Mary and Dawson Rivers in Queensland. Numbers can be prolific in some locations, such as the Mary River. Conversely it is uncommon in the Elliott and Kolan Rivers. Fish species it is commonly found with include Marjorie's hardyhead (Craterocephalus marjoriae), crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi), Australian smelt (Retropinna semoni) and western carp gudgeon (Hypseleotris klunzingeri).|$|E
5|$|When {{targeting}} livestock, {{the spotted}} hyena primarily preys upon cattle, sheep and goats, though hyenas {{in the southern}} parts of Ethiopia's Tigray region preferentially target donkeys. Reports of livestock damage are often not substantiated, and hyenas observed scavenging on a carcass may be mistaken for having killed the animal. The {{rate at which the}} species targets livestock may depend on a number of factors, including stock keeping practices, the availability of wild prey and human-associated sources of organic material, such as rubbish. Surplus killing has been recorded in South Africa's <b>eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> Province. Attacks on stock tend to be fewer in areas where livestock is coralled by thorn fences and where domestic dogs are present. One study in northern Kenya revealed that 90% of all cases of livestock predation by hyenas occurred in areas outside the protection of thorn fences.|$|E

5|$|Alfred John Shout {{was born}} in Wellington, New Zealand, on 8 August 1882. He was the eldest of nine {{children}} to an English-born father, John Richard Shout, and Irish mother, Agnes Mary (née Kelly, formerly McGovern). Information on Alfred Shout's early life is rather scant and the details differ between sources, but according to his First World War attestation form he was privately educated. In early 1900, Shout travelled to South Africa with his elder half-brother, William McGovern. The brothers sought to join one of the colonial contingents then engaged in the Second Boer War; Alfred enlisted in the newly raised Border Horse on 17 February 1900, while William (using the surname Shout) found a place in Bethune's Mounted Infantry. The Border Horse was an irregular colonial force formed in <b>eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> Colony, and Shout was allotted to the unit's No.1 Company with the service number 9216.|$|E
5|$|Bantu Stephen Biko {{was born}} on 18 December 1946, at his grandmother's house in Tarkastad, <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape.</b> The third child of Mzingaye Mathew Biko and Alice 'Mamcete' Biko, he had an older sister, Bukelwa, an older brother, Khaya, and a younger sister, Nobandile. His parents had married in Whittlesea, where his father worked as a police officer. Mzingaye was {{transferred}} to Queenstown, Port Elizabeth, Fort Cox, and finally King William's Town, where he and Alice settled in Ginsberg township. This was a settlement of around 800 families, with every four families sharing a water supply and toilet. Both Bantu African and Coloured people lived in the township, where Xhosa, Afrikaans, and English were all spoken. After resigning from the police force, Mzingaye worked as a clerk in the King William's Town Native Affairs Office, while studying for a law degree by correspondence from the University of South Africa. Alice was employed first in domestic work for local white households, then as a cook at Grey Hospital in King William's Town. According to his sister, it was this observation of his mother's difficult working conditions that resulted in Biko's earliest politicisation.|$|E
5|$|Female copper sharks {{make use}} of shallow inshore habitats, varying from {{stretches}} of open coast to more sheltered bays and inlets, as nurseries. These nurseries provide abundant food and {{reduce the likelihood of}} predation by larger members of the species. Known and suspected nursery areas occur off northern North Island from Waimea Inlet to Hawke Bay for New Zealand sharks, off Albany, in and around Gulf St Vincent, and in Port Phillip Bay for Australian sharks, off Niigata (Japan) for northwestern Pacific sharks, off the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Cape</b> for South Africa sharks, off Rhodes (Greece), Nice (France), and Al Hoceima (Morocco) for Mediterranean sharks, off Río de Oro (Western Sahara) for northwest African sharks, off Rio de Janeiro (Brazil) and Buenos Aires and Bahía Blanca (Argentina) for southwestern Atlantic sharks, and off Paita and Guanape Cove (Peru), in Sebastián Vizcaíno Bay (Mexico), and in and around San Diego Bay for eastern Pacific sharks.|$|E
