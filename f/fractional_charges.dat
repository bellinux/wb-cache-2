40|$|Fermion-number fractionalization without {{breaking}} of time-reversal symmetry was recently demonstrated for a field theory in (2 + 1) -dimensional {{space and time}} that describes the couplings between massive Dirac fermions, a complex-valued Higgs field carrying an axial gauge charge of 2, and a U(1) axial gauge field. Charge fractionalization occurs whenever the Higgs field either supports vortices by itself, or when these vortices are accompanied by half-vortices in the axial gauge field. The <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> is computed by three different techniques. A formula for the <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> is given {{as a function of}} a parameter in the Dirac Hamiltonian that breaks the spectral energy-reflection symmetry. In the presence of a charge ± 1 vortex in the Higgs field only, the <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> varies continuously and thus can take irrational values. The simultaneous presence of a half-vortex in the axial gauge field and a charge ± 1 vortex in the Higgs field re-rationalizes the <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> to the value 1 / 2.

40|$|We examine <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> {{and spin}} errors in self-consistent Green's {{function}} theory within a second-order approximation (GF 2). For GF 2 {{it is known}} that the summation of diagrams resulting from the self-consistent solution of the Dyson equation removes the divergences pathological to second-order Moller-Plesset theory (MP 2) for strong correlations. In the language often used in density functional theory contexts, this means GF 2 has a greatly reduced fractional spin error relative to MP 2. The natural question then is what effect, if any, does the Dyson summation have on the <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> error in GF 2 ? To this end we generalize our previous implementation of GF 2 to open-shell systems and analyze its <b>fractional</b> spin and <b>charge</b> errors. We find that like MP 2, GF 2 possesses only a very small <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> error, and consequently little many electron self-interaction error. This shows that GF 2 improves on the critical failings of MP 2, but without altering the positive features that make it desirable. Furthermore, we find that GF 2 has both less <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> and <b>fractional</b> spin errors than typical hybrid density functionals as well as random phase approximation with exchange...|$|R
40|$|The <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> {{approach}} to Ion-interaction chromatography (IIC) of zwitterions {{was used to}} quantitatively explain their retention behavior {{as a function of}} the Ion Interaction Reagent (H) concentration in the stationary phase and also to account for the influence of the zwitterion ionization degree, according to the mobile phase pH.

40|$|In the Standard Model of {{particle}} physics, the quarks and anti-quarks have <b>fractional</b> <b>charge</b> equal to ± 1 / 3 or ± 2 / 3 of the electron's charge.
