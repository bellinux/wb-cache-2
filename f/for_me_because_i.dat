500|$|I {{like the}} whole dance. It was really {{different}} and weird <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> usually don't, you know, be a crazy person every time. It was so fun to do {{and it was really}} out of the box and it expanded me a lot, because I'm used to competition dances where you're like, [...] "Point your toes!" [...] But this time it was like, you just need to let go and feel it.|$|E
500|$|Upon signing for Sydney FC, Del Piero said, [...] "It's {{a special}} day for me. I {{am happy to}} {{announce}} that I just signed for two years for Sydney FC. This {{is a very big}} moment <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want to continue my career in a new part of the world where I can make a major contribution and help grow the game I love." [...] After the announcement of the transfer to Sydney FC, Juventus wished good luck to their former captain. Francesco Totti and Filippo Inzaghi said they were saddened by his departure.|$|E
500|$|... "I {{just wanted}} to create and do {{something}} different and branch out. At {{the heart of it}} I know it's still Evanescence and it's still me, but structurally it's a lot more fun. We went {{a lot of different ways}} with it instead of constantly sticking to the same structure and the same pop formula. I think it's more mature and more brave all around; it's like the instruments actually go together, the piano and guitar and vocals, since they're written together -- they intertwine. It's definitely even more personal. At least <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was there, it sounds more fun because I was having so much more fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Douglas," [...] she said, [...] "it was <b>because</b> <b>I</b> fancied {{that you}} were {{beginning}} to care <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew that I cared for you that <b>I</b> went away--not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was afraid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She always disliked me," [...] said Rowland. [...] "But {{that does}} n't matter now. I have come here simply <b>because</b> you sent <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can help you. I cannot advise your daughter." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{shook my}} head. [...] "You would not heed me," [...] I {{answered}} sadly. [...] "I dare not tell you. But {{there is one}} thing," [...] I added hastily. [...] "Will you do it <b>for</b> <b>me</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>I</b> ask you?" ...|$|R
500|$|Director Kim Manners {{noted that}} the episode [...] "was a really good show <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had not {{got a chance to}} work with Mitch. And they wrote a great script, you know? It was really {{something}} he could sink his teeth into and he just did a great job. Bill Davis was fabulous in that show too". This was the second episode of the series to not feature Scully, the first being the second season episode [...] "3". Guest actor Morris Panych, portraying the Syndicate assassin The Grey-Haired Man, makes his last appearance in the series in this episode. Panych had previously appeared in [...] "Piper Maru", [...] "Avatar", [...] "Herrenvolk" [...] and [...] "Memento Mori".|$|E
500|$|In the season-ending RAC Rally in Great Britain, Mouton {{continued}} her good performances by running third at half distance, despite having been uncomfortable about competing in a rally where pacenotes and practice are not allowed. However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, {{it was not easy}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> did not have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much." [...] Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers' standings.|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't {{have any kind of}} blow-up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why did I come down?" [...] he {{continued}} in reply to our sad queries. [...] "Why did I come down, do you ask? Because she was wretched, and sent <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>Because</b> if <b>I</b> {{was at the}} end of the world, and she was to say, 'Jack, come!' I'd come." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Last of all," [...] he said, {{and this}} time his voice was not quite so steady, [...] "are you really sure that you care <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> dear, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have loved you so long, and I have wanted love so badly, and it {{is so hard to}} believe--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{beg your}} pardon," [...] he said. [...] "Please don't think me impertinent, but I am really {{curious to know}} whether that young woman was honest or not. She refused to read my hand or look into the crystal <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was a man. Did she treat you in just the same way?" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Good Enough" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee for her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler. It was {{produced}} by Dave Fortman and recorded in Record Plant Studios, Los Angeles. The single was scheduled for release in Germany in a basic and premium format on December 14, 2007, but a release date was never officially announced. While discussing Evanescences then upcoming album, The Open Door, Lee revealed {{that one of the}} tracks would be called [...] "Good Enough". She said, [...] "It's called 'Good Enough,' and it's completely, completely, completely different for me because it sort of [...] happy ending. It's the last song that I wrote for the record, and it's sort of the bravest, I think, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had to tell the truth and the truth is, I feel, good now. The rest of the album is pretty aggressive and dark and everything else, but the last one is like, I got to the good place that I was heading for and I wrote about how good I felt. It turned out amazing, but it's like nothing we've ever done. I just have to write from my heart and be genuine, because I think that's what people loved about our music to begin with, and if that changes, then that changes." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{the casting}} call was issued, there was brief {{speculation}} that the character was a recast for Chance Chancellor, {{who was also a}} war veteran. Later, Burton's name was attached to the role. During an appearance on The Talk the following January, Burton officially confirmed that he was cast as Dylan. The episode of The Talk was described as [...] "phenomenal"; Burton had no idea it would have been [...] "New Year's Eve kinda crazy." [...] After one of the show's co-hosts Julie Chen made the announcement of his casting and welcomed Burton to the CBS family, confetti dropped while another co-host Sheryl Underwood did a [...] "wild happy dance". Burton said, [...] "I had no idea about the CBS badge or the welcome basket, or anything. [...] That’s not how I think. I understood why CBS did it, because it’s a big deal. I get it. It’s so strange <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have never been one for all this publicity. They have been so gracious to me, and it was so overwhelming that they would do something like that." [...] Burton made his first on-screen appearance during the episode dated January 29, 2013. He attributed much of his success going back to the 1990s when he studied acting at Theater Theater in Hollywood, California, coached by Chris Aable.|$|E
2500|$|At a press junket for The Rum Diary {{shortly before}} the film's release, Depp {{said that he would}} like to adapt The Curse of Lono, [...] "The Kentucky Derby Is Decadent and Depraved", and [...] for the big screen: [...] "I'd just keep playing Hunter. There's a great comfort in it <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> get a great visit with my old friend who I miss dearly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And yet {{you come}} to <b>me</b> <b>for</b> favour,--to <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am her friend. You cannot win her yourself, and think I may help you! I {{do not believe in}} your love for her. There! If there were no other reason, and I could help you, <b>I</b> would not, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think your heart is a sham heart. She is pretty, and has money--" ...|$|R
6000|$|He.--Well, I used to {{live with}} people, who took a liking <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> [...] plainly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was gifted with all these qualities to such a [...] rare degree.|$|R
5000|$|... “It {{was really}} an {{experience}} <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> again, <b>I</b> was able to learn that there were whites tha were suffering {{the same way that}} blacks were as it relates to economics. Now, not having access to all of the restrooms, not getting into the lunchroom, they didn’t have those problems. But, actually, they weren’t making any money, and that’s where the problem lies.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Schwahn {{eventually}} {{began to}} change the character's styles, especially in season 4 and up. Burton said, [...] "Peyton's wardrobe has changed quite a bit, which is nice <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am a... In real-life I am , and was wearing T-shirts and jeans, and Converse sneakers for five years." [...] She said that after some time, it weighed on her femininity. With the four-year timeline jump, Peyton got to wear more skirts and dresses, and shorter ones. [...] "Boobs aren't bigger, but legs are out," [...] said Burton.|$|E
2500|$|The film {{initially}} had a [...] "John Hughes vibe" [...] to it, which concerned Reznor at first, {{but after}} meeting with Fincher and trying out different ideas with Atticus Ross, {{it turned out to}} work a lot more smoothly after all. Reznor recalled, [...] "The whole process was fun <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> liked answering to someone I respect and not having to make all the decisions for a change." [...] Reznor and Ross would try sketches of songs, figuring they would have to revise it eventually, only for Fincher to get back to them and say, [...] "I don't have anything bad to say – that's never happened before." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{appearing}} in Sweet Charity, Applegate broke her foot, {{and it was}} announced that the musical would close during previews. She persuaded the producers to rescind their decision and on April 18, 2005, she made her Broadway debut. [...] Because of her injury, Applegate had to wear special shoes to prevent another incident, and in a 2013 interview said that because of what happened, she [...] "actually can't dance anymore. And that is sad <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> always wanted to go back. But I probably won't be able to." [...] She does dance whenever the opportunity presents, but cannot do any more strenuous roles.|$|E
60|$|Of such stuff {{are the men}} of {{my beloved}} Helium, and when I meet another of their kind, of {{whatever}} race or color, {{my heart goes out}} to him as it did now to my new friend who had risked his life <b>for</b> <b>me</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wore the mate to the ring his ruler had put upon his finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to ask {{a great deal of}} you, and remind you of a promise you once made." [...] There was a little tremor in her voice. [...] "You will not think it ungracious if I say there is no one else who can do what seems so necessary, and ask you if you do not {{consider}} that you owe something to my father. It is hard <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> doubt you, but because----" ...|$|R
3000|$|... `I {{like doing}} things where I {{can see what}} I’ve done {{at the end of}} it – like {{colouring}} hair. You know when you get it right…and it makes you feel good. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> that’s learning <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can use it again’ (Emma).|$|R
2500|$|By late 1937, Méliès {{had become}} very ill and Langlois {{arranged}} {{for him to}} be admitted to the Léopold Bellan Hospital in Paris. Langlois had become close to him, and he and Franju visited him shortly before his death. When they arrived, Méliès showed them one of his last drawings of a champagne bottle with the cork popped and bubbling over. He then told them: [...] "Laugh, my friends. Laugh with me, laugh <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> dream your dreams." [...] Georges Méliès died of cancer on 21 January 1938 at age 76 — just hours after the passing of Émile Cohl, another great French film pioneer — and was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.|$|E
2500|$|Nicolodi {{devised the}} {{original}} story concept but received no on-screen credit {{for her work}} on the screenplay. Nicolodi explained {{that she did not}} seek credit because [...] "having fought so hard to see my humble but excellent work in Suspiria recognized (up until {{a few days before the}} première I didn't know if I would see my name in the film credits), I didn't want to live through that again, so I said, 'Do as you please, in any case, the story will talk <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wrote it.'" [...] Working from Nicolodi's original story notes, Argento wrote the screenplay while staying in a New York hotel room with a view of Central Park.|$|E
2500|$|Sirtis {{was delighted}} to {{get the chance to}} do some comedy in Star Trek: First Contact and said, [...] "I loved it because it opened the door to a {{different}} side of Troi we'd never seen before. That door has stayed open and that whole kind of wacky, zany Troi thing has continued into the next movie, which is great <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> like to do things that are different." [...] Sirtis stated of her role in Star Trek: Nemesis, [...] "I sort of had an inkling that I {{was going to have a}} good part in this film because John Logan was such a big fan of the character. So I knew that he would do her some justice." ...|$|E
40|$|Holding {{forth in}} this amphitheater {{is a true}} deja vu {{experience}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> years ago <b>I</b> conducted Grand Rounds many times from the very same podium. I am delighted to {{see that in the}} 18 years since my departure, the Fitkin amphitheater has retained the same threadbare gentility that characterized it during my tenure here as...|$|R
5000|$|Joel Keller of TV Squad {{stated in}} his review [...] "'Chirp' only {{generated}} one really big laugh <b>for</b> <b>me</b> -- probably <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have a dirty mind" [...] despite this he also stated [...] "it was still a decent episode because both Jay and Phil looked utterly human this week." ...|$|R
5000|$|During filming, Dunst {{purposely}} did {{not read}} {{any of the}} non-Ed and Peggy related storylines, saying [...] "Peggy's so in her own world, I didn't want {{to be influenced by}} anything else that was happening in the story. So I just would read things that were happening with Ed and Peg. She's so tunnel-visioned about her goals and what needs to happen that I didn't want to think about the whole show. It makes it more fun <b>for</b> <b>me</b> now, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can watch and enjoy it myself and not know what everyone's going to say." ...|$|R
2500|$|Speaking in January 2010 to noted UK soul writer Pete Lewis of {{the award-winning}} Blues & Soul, Fakir {{confirmed}} {{plans for the}} [...] "new" [...] Four Tops to release a new album, while revealing his personal feelings about the current line-up: [...] "To me the new group is like {{an extension of the}} family, because we've all been very close for so many years... Which makes it easier <b>for</b> <b>ME,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> truly miss Lawrence, [...] "Obie" [...] AND Levi - I'd be lying if I said I didn't - and not one of them could EVER be replaced. But, you know, these new guys do perform well enough for the people to still enjoy the shows and still enjoy the music. So for me, it kinda makes it bittersweet. Because, {{at the end of the}} day, the legacy is still going on and I'm very pleased that it IS!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} track, [...] "Staying Alive", {{was written}} and produced by Jay R Sillona and Keith Martin under Sillona's own recording label, Homeworkz Records. The song uses Auto-Tune, and features rap verses by Q-York and additional back-up vocals by beauty queen Krista Kleiner, who was Sillona's {{partner at the}} time. It marked {{the second time that}} Nina collaborated with Sillona, since their duet of [...] "Muli" [...] in early 2010. The song is described as [...] "another smoking track with bold and powerful lyrics: 'I shouldn't let them knock me down down down... I'm staying alive.'" [...] "However Much Love" [...] is an acoustic flute-driven song, considered as one of Nina's distinctly slow and sentimental ballads in the album. The lyrics speak of steadfast and unconditional love. Philippine Entertainment Portal called it a [...] "standout," [...] stating [...] "Nina's voice heightens the pain and vulnerability evoked by the lyrics and melody." [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] is an inspirational power ballad, written by Jude Gitamondoc. Nina insisted the song's inclusion with the purpose of encouraging her listeners to pursue their goals despite adversities. Its message is about not giving up on your dreams. Nina related the lyrics to her personal struggles, saying [...] "That's important <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>because</b> <b>I,</b> really, almost gave up [...] If this is what you always wanted to do, if this is your dream, don't lose hope. Go for it. Me, I almost gave up and if not for my faith and belief in God, I would have lost the hope that was left. So, just really keep on reaching for your dreams." ...|$|E

5000|$|Two {{months before}} {{composing}} this first component part of Montag aus Licht, Stockhausen said: I {{have had the}} feeling {{for some time that}} Monday will be very different—very new <b>for</b> <b>me</b> too, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> have the feeling Monday is the reverse, because it's the birth. So it's the reverse of everything that I have done up to now. Most probably all the formulas will be upside-down, will be mirrored: like The Woman is in respect to the men. I think all the structural material all of a sudden is going to change drastically in the detail.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ask no forgiveness," [...] she said. [...] "May God torture <b>me</b> <b>for</b> ever, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> killed her; may I {{become a}} brute for ever till {{she comes to}} find me and forgives me! I only want her forgiveness." [...] And wailing in an anguish of the heart so strong that her bodily {{suffering}} seemed to be forgotten, Hendrika, the Baboon-woman, died.|$|R
5000|$|After {{more than}} a year of denials Pratt {{subsequently}} admitted his guilt, acknowledging he and his company, and [...] "rival" [...] company Amcor deliberately broke the law. Pratt was aggrieved by the criminal prosecution and its effect on his reputation, stating:"I feel very angry—Visy is seen as Richard Pratt's company—there is a certain amount of character assassination <b>for</b> <b>me</b> personally <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am a tall poppy in the community; it's a big scalp (for the ACCC). My reputation is something I have been building for 50 years and so I am worried that the general public will now see me as a rich person who has made his money doing something that is wrong in the eyes of the law." ...|$|R
