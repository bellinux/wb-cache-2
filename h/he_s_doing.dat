40|$|Sometimes a {{proposition}} is 'opaque' to an agent: (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> doesn't know it, but (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{know something about}} how coming to know it should affect his or her credence function. It is tempting to assume that a rational agent's credence function coheres {{in a certain way}} with his or her knowledge of these opaque propositions, and I call this the 'Opaque Proposition Principle'. The principle is compelling but demonstrably false. I explain this incongruity by showing that the principle is ambiguous: the term 'know' as it appears in the principle can be interpreted in two different ways, as either basic-know or super-know. I use this distinction to construct a plausible version of the principle, and then to similarly construct plausible versions of the Reflection Principle and the Sure-Thing Principle...|$|R

A scaling analyses reveal several interesting features: strong party political structure and some structure related to the region, gender and age of the signing MPs. Both principal components and classification tree methods produced interpretable models that can successfully assign MPs to their political party. Conversely, only weak structures are found amongst the EDMs and no structure organizing MPs into common signing blocs of MPs and issues was discovered.

40|$|Introduction The new {{generation}} of "notepad" computers as well as electronic whiteboards open a new dimension for designing user interfaces for engineering software. The essential component that makes such computers attractive is the so-called "paper-like" interface in which the user can use handsketches and work {{in a similar way}} as (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> with paper and pen.

Such freehand drawings are called gestures. The main advantage of using gestures is that a single gesture combines both the command name and required parameters. Gestural interfaces are appropriate for pen-based computers because a gesture can be easily sketched with an electronic pen. Gestures may be used for common operations across many application domains...|$|R
40|$|Martin Peters was a {{successful}} footballer whose public persona matched the way he played the game, without fuss or fanfare. A key English player of the 1960 <b>s,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not usually feature in discussions about the connection between fashion and football in that decade. The focus is usually placed on players with celebrity status, especially George Best. This paper, working {{at the intersection of}} sport and fashion history and cultural studies, broadens the discussion by giving consideration to the non-celebrity-type player. This is done via an examination of the off-field dress and style of Martin Peters. The case is made, from studying the sartorial presentation of Peters, that we can recognize a connection between the player and other young men who favoured a low-key identification with the Mod culture of the time. This position supports a shift within the cultural historical study of British youth and masculine identity from the spectacular to the unspectacular...|$|R
40|$|All of Percy’s works {{circle around}} what {{he refers to}} as “the modern malaise” 1 or “post-Christian malaise,” 2 a deep {{transformation}} of the consciousness of modern Western man. Such a malaise is marked by a crippling feeling of limitation, a sense of disorientation, and loss of identity: “People are suffering from a deep dislocation in their lives, alienation from themselves, dehumanization [...] I’m not talking about poverty, racial discrimination, and women’s rights. I’m talking about the malaise which seems to overtake the very people who seem to have escaped these material and social evils. ” 3 To Percy the essence of this transformation is not primarily sociological, although he does not ignore this aspect. Unlike the Agrarians of the 1920 s and 30 <b>s,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not blame the feeling of impoverishment exclusively on the negative impacts of economic and technological progress, on mass society, mechanization, and urbanization. To him the decline has an ontologi-cal quality located at the very root of modern existence. It show...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} learn the nurses' opinion {{concerning}} the work they perform with families {{in the context of}} the Family Health Program and which are the necessary competences to accomplish it. This is an exploratory-descriptive study, of qualitative nature, carried out with 20 nurses who worked at a Family Health Center. The data were collected through a semi-structured interview and the Bardin's referential was used for the analysis of content. The results revealed that the work with families is structured based on the actions and relationships existent between the professionals and the families, because the establishment and maintenance of such relations interfere in the quality of the assistance. Regarding the necessary competences, the importance of the scientific technical knowledge (know-how) and especially the ability to relate with the families and with other team members are emphasized. In addition, commitment, involvement and ethical posture were named, which are aspects easily reached when a person likes what (<b>s)</b> <b>he</b> <b>does...</b>|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} {{the safety of the}} hydroalcoholic extract (HE) of Syzygium cumini (L.) Skeels, Myrtaceae, leaves in rodents. Acute toxicity was evaluated through the determination of a LD 50 in mice and rats (up to 14 days). In mice, the oral administration (p. o.) of the HE (0. 1 at 6 g/kg) did not cause any death. When administered by intraperitoneal route (i. p.) the HE (0. 1 at 1 g/kg) caused death of the animals (LD 50 of 0. 489 g/kg). In rats, the HE (0. 5, 1 and 2 g/kg, p. o.) did not cause any death, while by i. p., only the 2 g/kg dose was lethal to 67 % of the animals. To evaluate chronic toxicity, groups of rats daily received the HE (0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 25 g/kg) through p. o., during 30, 90 or 180 days and the effects on behavior, body weight, feed consumed were measured. Histology, hematology and biochemical parameters were measured {{at the end of the}} treatment. After a 30 -day treatment, the HE caused changes in some biochemical parameters. Histological examination of the liver, kidneys, lungs, heart, stomach, intestine and pancreas showed normal architecture suggesting no morphological disturbances.
