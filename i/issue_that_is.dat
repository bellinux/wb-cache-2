For example, an employee suing a foreign corporation in a state of employment, may enjoy the public policy to protect local employees from foreign abusers.

25|$|I think {{global warming}} is an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} relevant, time sensitive, and {{a symptom of the}} shortsightedness of the U.S. As a broader metaphor, the drowning Statue of Liberty, a revered icon of the U.S., symbolizes the eminent demise of many of the ideals upon which the nation was founded. Civil liberties, freedom of speech, privacy, etc. have been decreasing since 9/11. The sun in the image could either be setting or rising and this ambiguity shows that there is still hope to turn things around... The U.S. is the dominant global force. When things are going wrong in the U.S. they are probably going wrong around the world. I think this image conveys both the U.S. situation and its larger global implications.|$|E
25|$|As {{previously}} mentioned, linear chromosomes face another <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{not seen}} in circular DNA replication. Due {{to the fact that}} an RNA primer is required for initiation of DNA synthesis, the lagging strand is at a disadvantage in replicating the entire chromosome. While the leading strand can use a single RNA primer to extend the 5' terminus of the replicating DNA strand, multiple RNA primers are responsible for lagging strand synthesis, creating Okazaki fragments. This leads to an issue {{due to the fact that}} DNA polymerase is only able to add to the 3' end of the DNA strand. The 3'-5' action of DNA polymerase along the parent strand leaves a short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) region at the 3' end of the parent strand when the Okazaki fragments have been repaired. Since replication occurs in opposite directions at opposite ends of parent chromosomes, each strand is a lagging strand at one end. Over time this would result in progressive shortening of both daughter chromosomes. This is known as the end replication problem.|$|E

Hygiene was difficult to control with these older barrels, and they could develop faults in the wine, including discoloration. These old barrels fell out of favor, replaced by stainless steel fermentation tanks which also controlled temperatures.|$|E

2500|$|The 23(a) {{criteria}} {{are referred to}} as numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy. Numerosity refers to {{the number of people in}} the class. To be certified, the class has to have enough members that simply adding each of them as a named party to the lawsuit would be impractical. There is no bright-line rule to determine numerosity, but classes with hundreds of members are generally deemed to be sufficiently numerous. To satisfy commonality, there must be a common question of law and fact such that [...] "determination of its truth or falsity will resolve an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> central to the validity of each one of the claims in one stroke." [...] The typicality requirement ensures that the claims or defenses of the named plaintiff are typical of those of everyone else in the class. [...] Finally, adequacy requirement states that the named plaintiff must fairly and adequately represent the interests of the absent class members.|$|E
2500|$|In the West, some {{elements}} of determinism {{seem to have been}} expressed by the Presocratics Heraclitus and Leucippus. The first full-fledged notion of determinism appears to originate with the Stoics, as part of their theory of universal causal determinism. The resulting philosophical debates, which involved the confluence of elements of Aristotelian Ethics with Stoic psychology, led in the 1st-3rd centuries CE in the works of Alexander of Aphrodisias to the first recorded Western debate over determinism and freedom, an <b>issue</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> known in theology as the paradox of free will. The writings of Epictetus as well as Middle Platonist and early Christian thought were instrumental in this development. The Jewish philosopher Moses Maimonides said of the deterministic implications of an omniscient god: [...] "Does God know or does He not know that a certain individual will be good or bad? If thou sayest 'He knows', then it necessarily follows that [...] man is compelled to act as God knew beforehand he would act, otherwise God's knowledge would be imperfect.…" ...|$|E
