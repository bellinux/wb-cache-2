25|$|This linear {{theory is}} often used to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> and rough {{estimate}} of wave characteristics and their effects. This approximation is accurate for small ratios of the wave height to water depth (for waves in shallow water), and wave height to wavelength (for waves in deep water).|$|E
500|$|The {{primary purpose}} of the indoor-outdoor {{thermometer}} is to allow the outside temperature to be indicated inside a building, thus removing the need to go outside to take a temperature reading. [...] They are also used in vehicles, and are particularly useful for municipal vehicles involved in snow and ice clearance. Building maintenance engineers can use an indoor-outdoor thermometer that has not been installed to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> reading of air temperature in a location inside a building. [...] This is done by swinging the bulb of the outdoor sensor in the air while still attached to the instrument. This will get a faster reading because the bulb will come up to temperature much more quickly than the indoor sensor built into the instrument.|$|E

50|$|Bentick {{played for}} two years in Victoria's top under-18s competition, the TAC Cup for the Calder Cannons. In that time, he {{established}} himself as a promising mid-fielder who was particularly good at roving the hit-outs and <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> kick out of the packs. Calder dominated the TAC Cup through these years, and under Bentick's captaincy won the 2003 premiership.|$|R
500|$|Hepburn's only {{husband was}} Ludlow Ogden Smith, a socialite-businessman from Philadelphia whom she met while {{a student at}} Bryn Mawr. The couple married on December 12, 1928, when she was 21 and he was 29. Hepburn had Smith change his name to S. Ogden Ludlow {{so that she would}} not be known as [...] "Kate Smith", which she {{considered}} too plain. She never fully committed to the marriage and prioritized her career. The move to Hollywood in 1932 cemented the couple's estrangement, and in 1934, she traveled to Mexico to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> divorce. Hepburn often expressed her gratitude toward Smith for his financial and moral support {{in the early days of}} her career, and in her autobiography called herself [...] "a terrible pig" [...] for exploiting his love. The pair remained friends until his death in 1979.|$|E
2500|$|A {{slug test}} is a {{variation}} on [...] the typical aquifer test where an instantaneous change (increase or decrease) is made, and the effects are observed in the same well. This is often used in geotechnical or engineering settings to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> estimate (minutes instead of days) of the aquifer properties immediately around the well.|$|E
2500|$|In baseball, on {{the other}} hand, the [...] "home" [...] team always bats last. This was not {{originally}} the case. In the early years, the winner of a coin toss could decide whether to bat first or last. The more offence-oriented aspect of the early game might influence a team's decision to bat first and hope to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> lead. This led to the occasional unfortunate situation where the home town crowd would have to watch their team lose a game {{in the last of}} the ninth inning, in [...] "sudden victory" [...] fashion by the visiting team. By the late 1800s, the rule was changed to compel the home team to bat last. At a [...] "neutral" [...] site, such as the College World Series, the [...] "home" [...] team may be decided by coin toss, but that [...] "home" [...] team must bat last.|$|E

6000|$|On {{throwing}} {{these results}} into a common statistical hotch-pot, I first examined into {{the rate at}} which these associated ideas were formed. It took a total time of 660 seconds to form the 505 ideas; that is, at about the rate of 50 in a minute, or 3000 in an hour. This would be miserably slow work in reverie, or wherever the thought follows the lead of each association that successively presents itself. In the present case, much time was lost in mentally taking the word in, owing to the quiet unobtrusive way in which I found it necessary to bring it into view, so as not to distract the thoughts. Moreover, a substantive standing by itself is usually the equivalent of too abstract an idea for us to conceive properly without delay. Thus {{it is very difficult to}} <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> conception of the word [...] "carriage," [...] because there are so many different kinds--two-wheeled, four-wheeled, open and closed, and all of them in so many different possible positions, that the mind possibly hesitates amidst an obscure sense of many alternatives that cannot blend together. But limit the idea to say a laudau, and the mental association declares itself more quickly. Say a laudau coming down the street to opposite the door, and an image of many blended laudaus that have done so forms itself without the least hesitation.|$|E

On May 13, 2007, he was traded to the Florida Marlins for Jorge Julio. As a Marlin, he proved himself as a dependable starter.|$|R
50|$|As {{a partner}} in the group, however, he could not be summarily fired as though he were an employee. The result was a series of {{lawsuits}} in which, at one point - as <b>a</b> ploy to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>quicker</b> settlement from Stigwood - he attempted to block the Bee Gees from using that name, since it was jointly owned by the partners, and he alleged that he had been illegally deprived of his share in the partnership. Petersen remained on good terms with the brothers, especially Robin Gibb, after his initial exit.|$|R
50|$|Eggbeater is used {{in water}} polo because it lets the athletes use their arms to throw the ball. The eggbeater kick is the primary kick that enables the player to support {{themselves}} in the water while passing, shooting, defending, and resting - horizontally and vertically. It is also used for <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick,</b> explosive start, when the player is beginning to swim. Greater elevation of the Polo player is created by a stronger eggbeater kick which results in a better rotation and stronger pass or shot. Overuse of the eggbeater kick has been a cause of knee injuries in water polo players.|$|R

40|$|When I {{first heard}} of {{meta-analysis}} in the mid- 1980 s,I was suspicious. After slaving for 3 {{years on a}} case-control study of renal adenocarcinoma that yielded just 3 papers, the idea of someone else <b>getting</b> <b>a</b> <b>quick</b> publication by quantitatively pooling my findings with other studies seemed parasitic, if not plagiarist. On the other hand, I was aware that reviews of scientific literature often simply bolstered the authorsâ€™ opinions by citing supportive studies and glossing over, dismissing or overlooking unsupportive studies. My suspicion was reduced by Meir Stampferâ€™s important paper pooling results of streptokinase trials. I decided meta-analysis might be appropriate for drug trials. However, I was troubled by {{the conflict between the}} apparent goal of metaanalysis â€“- to achieve statistical significance or tight confidence intervals â€” and Rothmanâ€™s and othersâ€™ criticism of p-values.
