50|$|The Hanfparade {{began at}} 12:00 on August 23, 2003 with a 60-minute {{demonstration}} before the Federal Ministry of Finance at the William route (between Leipziger road and Niederkirchnerstrasse) in Berlin. The parade of 13 <b>floats</b> <b>ran</b> peacefully. There were announcements however due to offenses against the Betäubungsmittelgesetz.|$|R
50|$|In the 1960s BTH {{apprenticeships}} {{were highly}} thought-of, with apprentices exposed to {{production of a}} wide range of industrial products. Each year in Rugby there was a big parade of <b>floats</b> <b>run</b> by its apprentices, many of whom lodged in the nearby Coton House apprentice hostel.|$|R

50|$|The main {{stem and}} some of its tributaries are popular with boaters of various skill levels. Depending on which {{segments}} are being <b>run,</b> <b>floats</b> on these streams vary from Class I (easy) to IV (very difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty.|$|R
50|$|Wall screeds are plumbed {{and ceiling}} screeds leveled. Screeds are narrow strips of plastering, {{carefully}} plumbed and leveled, {{so as to}} form a guide upon which the <b>floating</b> rule is <b>run,</b> thus securing a perfectly horizontal or vertical surface, or, {{in the case of}} circular work, a uniform curve.|$|R
50|$|The Mardi Gras has {{included}} a Wear it Purple {{float in the}} parade in 2011, 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017. The 2017 <b>float</b> was <b>run</b> {{in conjunction with the}} NSW Police Force GLLOs (Gay and Lesbian Liaison Officers). The Australian Pride Network awarded the Wear it Purple stall at Fair Day with Best Fair Day Youth Stall (2014), and Best Community stall (2016). In a 2011 interview, co-founder Scott Williams highlighted the importance of Mardi Gras to young people, and for Wear it Purple to participate and bring visibility to young rainbow people.|$|R
6000|$|... "Grape and canister!" [...] {{the captain}} shouted, and {{broadside}} after broadside swept the decks of the brig, which, hampered by her wreckage, was lying almost motionless in the water. So terrible was the fire, that the privateer's men threw down the axes {{with which they}} were striving to cut away the <b>floating</b> spars, and <b>ran</b> below.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'll leave," [...] muttered the bully, {{and walking}} to the side, he sprang down to the <b>float.</b> Then he <b>ran</b> to the {{boathouse}} and placed the ax inside. [...] "Don't you dare to mention this to anybody!" [...] he shouted as he reappeared. [...] "If you do, you'll get yourself in hot water. My word {{is as good as}} yours." [...] And then he turned and ran towards the school building.|$|R
50|$|After being {{restored}} by trainees {{and volunteers}} from the fishing heritage group STAND, the floating museum {{opened to the public}} in 1999. STAND entered into partnership with the City Council to provide volunteers to maintain and act as tour guides. Today, the <b>floating</b> museum is <b>run</b> entirely by volunteers but supported by Hull City Council. Vessel is open Wednesday, Saturday and Sundays (and Bank Holiday Mondays) from Easter until end of October. Guided tours are free.|$|R
50|$|Gallo {{started as}} an {{enforcer}} and hitman for Joe Profaci in the Profaci crime family. He <b>ran</b> <b>floating</b> dice and high-stakes card games, an extortion racket and a numbers game betting operation. His headquarters was {{an apartment on}} President Street in Brooklyn, where Gallo allegedly kept a pet lion named Cleo in the basement. Within a few years he secretly owned several Manhattan nightclubs and two sweat shops in the Manhattan garment district where 40 or 50 women made fabric for dress suits.|$|R
50|$|The Lyman Run {{area was}} part of the massive lumbering {{operation}} that occurred in most of north central Pennsylvania in the 1880s and 1890s. The land near Lyman Run was purchased by Frank and Charles Goodyear. The Goodyear brothers owned a railroad and lumber company that harvested the old-growth white pine and hemlock. These logs were <b>floated</b> down Lyman <b>Run</b> to the log boom at Williamsport by way of the West Branch of Pine Creek, then Pine Creek itself, and finally the West Branch Susquehanna River.|$|R
50|$|Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation (BSTDC) {{operates}} MV Ganga Vihar from Gandhi Ghat. Ganga Vihar is a River Cruise {{ship with}} restaurant on-board {{also known as}} the <b>floating</b> restaurant. It <b>runs</b> Sunset Cruise and Leisure Cruise/Corporate Cruise with boarding for tourists from the ghat. Another vessel MV Kautilya was added in 2016 which is a cruise boat for tourist rides on river Ganges from Gandhi Ghat. The Tourism Department also plans to keep a floating jetty that would be placed at Gandhi Ghat, from where the two vessels operate.|$|R
50|$|All major Michigan railroads {{operated}} a rail ferry service across Lake Michigan except the Michigan Central. This {{can be attributed}} to MC's most direct route across Southern Michigan from Detroit to Chicago. The Michigan Central also had the best access to Chicago of any Michigan railroad. The Michigan Central did own part of the Mackinac Transportation Company, which operated the SS Chief Wawatam until 1984. The Chief Wawatam was a front-loading, hand-fired, coal-fed steamer. It was the last hand-fired steamer in the free world at its long-overdue retirement in 1984. The Chief Wawatam continued to operate until 2009, cut down to a barge. One Chief Wawatam engine was salvaged and restored by the Wisconsin Maritime Museum. Other artifacts from the ferry, including the whistle, wheel, telegraphs, and furniture, are preserved by the Mackinac Island State Park Commission in Mackinaw City. Car <b>floats</b> also <b>ran</b> across the Detroit River to Windsor, Ontario, for high and wide loads that could not fit through the tunnels.|$|R
50|$|In a <b>floating</b> jungle cafe <b>run</b> by Lola, {{the woman}} who financed Catalan, Adrien learns that Catalan murdered Agnès' father and that Agnès {{is being held in}} a boat. Rushing to the boat, Adrien hangs onto the side as it heads {{upstream}} and finally docks. While Catalan goes to the underground location of the treasure, Adrien kills all of Catalan's accomplices and rescues Agnès. Catalan finds the treasure, but an explosion set off by a nearby demolition crew causes him to be buried with it. Adrien and Agnès flee the jungle and arrive in Paris in time for Adrien to catch his train back to camp.|$|R
5000|$|Alford's {{work during}} the [...] "Tanker War" [...] phase of the Gulf War {{inspired}} development of the user-filled linear cutting family of charges which became known as Dioplex. Alford was invited to attempt the cutting operations of the deformed hulls which, {{by the time he}} got on the scene were either <b>floating</b> or were <b>run</b> up on the shore of Sirri Island. For this he designed linear cutting charges which consisted of strips of plywood, which were glued into elongate rectangular boxes, with a 90-degree steel liner inside. Each charge was closed with glued-on end pieces with holes for detonators or detonating cord and with a plywood lid.|$|R
5000|$|Today, Veracruz has {{the largest}} and best known Carnival in Mexico {{beginning}} with the “quema del mal humor” or the burning of bad mood and ending with the burial of “Juan Carnival.” The quema de mal humor is represented by an effigy of a disliked famous person, either Mexican or foreign. [...] Juan Carnival is another effigy which receives a mock funeral. In between there are the coronation of the Carnival Queen and her court, six parades {{with a minimum of}} thirty <b>floats</b> each that <b>run</b> between Veracruz and Boca del Río, dances, concerts by well-known artists which have included Enrique Iglesias, Espinoza Paz, Paulina Rubio and Cristian Castro and charity events.|$|R
6000|$|Here the glassy {{waters of}} the River Rhine, holding upon its bosom a mimic picture of the blue sky and white clouds <b>floating</b> above, <b>runs</b> {{smoothly}} around a jutting point of land, St. Michaelsburg, rising from the reedy banks of the stream, sweeps up with a smooth swell until it cuts sharp and clear against the sky. Stubby vineyards covered its earthy breast, and field and garden and orchard crowned its brow, where lay the Monastery of St. Michaelsburg--"The White Cross on the Hill." [...] There within the white walls, where the warm yellow sunlight slept, all was peaceful quietness, broken only now {{and then by the}} crowing of the cock or the clamorous cackle of a hen, the lowing of kine or the bleating of goats, a solitary voice in prayer, the faint accord of distant singing, or the resonant toll of the monastery bell from the high-peaked belfry that overlooked the hill and valley and the smooth, far-winding stream. No other sounds broke the stillness, for in this peaceful haven was never heard the clash of armor, the ring of iron-shod hoofs, or the hoarse call to arms.|$|R
40|$|Offshore {{floating}} {{wind turbine}} (OFWT) has been a challenging research spot because of the high-quality wind power and complex load environment. This paper focuses on the research of variable torque control of offshore wind turbine on Spar floating platform. The control objective in below-rated wind speed region is to optimize the output power by tracking the optimal tip-speed ratio and ideal power curve. Aiming at the external disturbances and nonlinear uncertain dynamic systems of OFWT because of the proximity to load centers and strong wave coupling, this paper proposes an advanced radial basis function (RBF) neural network approach for torque control of OFWT system at speeds lower than rated wind speed. The robust RBF neural network weight adaptive rules are acquired based on the Lyapunov stability analysis. The proposed control approach is tested and compared with the NREL baseline controller using the “NREL offshore 5 [*]MW wind turbine” model mounted on a Spar <b>floating</b> platform <b>run</b> on FAST and Matlab/Simulink, operating in the below-rated wind speed condition. The simulation results show a better performance in tracking the optimal output power curve, therefore, completing the maximum wind energy utilization...|$|R
5000|$|However, this boom {{began to}} falter due to {{building}} construction delays and overload on the transport system {{caused by an}} excess of bulky building materials. On January 10, 1926 the Prinz Valdemar, an old Danish warship {{on its way to}} becoming a <b>floating</b> hotel, <b>ran</b> aground and blocked Miami Harbor for nearly a month. Already overloaded, the three major railway companies soon declared an embargo on all incoming goods except food. The cost of living had skyrocketed and finding an affordable place to live was nearly impossible. This economic bubble was already collapsing when the catastrophic Great Miami Hurricane in 1926 swept through, ending whatever was left of the boom. The Category 4 storm was the 12th most costly and 12th most deadly to strike the United States during the 20th century. According to the Red Cross, there were 373 fatalities, but other estimates vary, due to the large number of people listed as [...] "missing". Between 25,000 and 50,000 people were left homeless in the Miami area. The Great Depression followed, causing more than sixteen thousand people in Miami to become unemployed. As a result, a Civilian Conservation Corps camp was opened in the area.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we extend the Murray and Papell (2002) study {{by using a}} {{non-parametric}} bootstrap approach which allows for non-normality, and focusing on quarterly real exchange rate in twenty OECD countries in the post- 1973 <b>floating</b> period. We <b>run</b> Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) regressions, and estimate the half-lives (and confidence intervals) from the corresponding impulse response functions. Further, we use an approximately median-unbiased estimator of the autoregressive parameters, and report the implied point estimates and confidence intervals. We find that accounting for nonnormality results in even higher estimates {{of the degree of}} persistence of PPP deviations, but, as in Murray and Papell (2002), the confidence intervals are so wide that no strong conclusions are warranted on the existence of a PPP puzzle...|$|R
5000|$|On December 29, 2011, tolling {{started on}} the SR 520 <b>floating</b> bridge, which <b>runs</b> between Seattle and the Eastside suburbs. The revenue {{generated}} from the tolls are planned {{to help pay for}} the replacement bridge, which opened in 2016. All tolling is done automatically with no tollbooths. Tolling for people without Good to Go passes is done by license plate and will either be deducted from their Good to Go account along with a processing fee, or billed by mail at extra cost if they have not established an account. The Good to Go system allows users to purchase RFID [...] "passes" [...] for their vehicles and charges a fee to those without the RFID chips to cover the increased billing costs.|$|R
50|$|Since Noatak is a {{national}} preserve, both subsistence hunting by local residents and sport hunting by outsiders are permitted in the preserve. If Noatak was {{a national}} park, only subsistence hunting would be allowed. Float trips on the Noatak River are a popular way to see the preserve. However, most trips on the Noatak River take place high on the river in Gates of the Arctic National Park, typically from Twelve Mile Creek to Lake Matcherak. Longer trips can continue through the preserve, although the lower river's braided stream presents difficulties beyond Noatak village. There are a few rapids on the river of Class II+, {{although most of the}} river is Class I or Class II. <b>Float</b> trip season <b>runs</b> from June or July, when the river thaws, to September. Biting insects are most prevalent in June and July.|$|R
500|$|An {{alternative}} ending {{was made}} for the special which was never broadcast, but was put as an extra on the DVD. In {{this version of the}} ending, when Mac sees Caroline <b>floating</b> away, he <b>runs</b> down the stairs and out of the castle to save her. Caroline begins to descend, and both Mac and Guy grab hold of one her legs to bring her down, but instead they are lifted into the air with her. While the three fly away Caroline exclaims [...] "We're all going to die!", to which Mac quite sternly says [...] "Caroline, there's something I've been meaning to tell you", opening the possibility that Mac is not going to die. Meanwhile, Alan and Joanna, after walking into the sea, are last seen hanging onto a buoy waiting to drown. They are still talking and waiting for the ocean to drown them.|$|R
60|$|When {{it reached}} his chin, {{which it did}} {{in less than a}} quarter of an hour from the time when he had first awoke, he swam across to the loophole, which was now but a few inches above the water, and through which a stream of water still poured. Impossible as it was for any human being to get through the narrow slit, an iron bar had been placed across it. Of this Rupert took hold, and {{remained}} quiescent as the water mounted higher and higher; presently it rose above the top of the loophole, and Rupert now watched anxiously how fast it <b>ran.</b> <b>Floating</b> on his back, and keeping a finger at the water level against the wall, he could feel that the water still rose. It seemed to him that the rise was slower and slower, and at last his finger remained against a point in the stones for some minutes without moving. The rise of the water inside the dungeon had ceased.|$|R
5000|$|An inner-city {{point man}} {{is on the}} run from both the cops and the crooks in this streetwise drama. T (Robert Hooks) is a {{combination}} pool shark, private detective, and all-purpose ghetto fixer who operates out of a billiards parlor in South Central Los Angeles. T has done well for himself—he buys a fancy new car every year, wears expensive suits, and lives in an upscale apartment. But, he also looks out for folks in South Central, has lukewarm connections with both the police and gangsters, and generally knows how to tell the good guys from the bad guys {{on either side of the}} law. T is approached by Chalky (Paul Winfield) and his partner, Pete (Ralph Waite), who <b>run</b> <b>floating</b> dice games in the neighborhood. Chalky tells T they've been ripped off several times by a group of four robbers, and they want to hire him to find out who the masked stick-up men are.|$|R
40|$|The <b>floating</b> point {{computation}} <b>runs</b> at the Central Information and Computing Complex (CICC) {{cluster of}} JINR accommodate requests for traditional sequential applications, parallel computing applications, {{as well as}} Grid applications launched within various virtual organizations. During {{the second half of}} 2008, the CICC JINR comprised a heterogeneous computing array of multicore processors with a total of 560 cores grouped in seven modules. Performance measurements made in 2007 and system exploitation evidenced the existence of bottlenecks which were identified and alleviated. As a result of the implemented optimizations, the system works efficiently for all three abovementioned categories of jobs. Within the Russian Data Intensive Grid (RDIG) consortium, which comprises, besides the CICC JINR, 14 Russian computing centres, our cluster covered a sizeable part of the RDIG share to the LHC projects during 2007 – 2008. Performance measure-ments using the High Performance LINPACK Benchmark showed relative figures {{at the level of the}} best results reported in the June 2008 TOP 500 edition of the most performing computers in the world...|$|R
40|$|Tests {{of three}} {{different}} inner breakwaters to protect the repair basin and inner harbor from waves entering through the existing harbor entrance were run this month. Two were located on Jade and Southern Shoals and one on Jade, Southern and Western Shoals. The breakwaters on the shoals reduce the disturbances {{in the areas of}} primary and secondary usage in the repair basin to less than half those occurring with the shoals alone. Combinations of breakwaters and channel fills between the various shoals supplemented the studies and these results are included as well. Tests were also run to compare the effectiveness in the outer harbor of the alternate entrance through Luminao Reef with that of the existing entrance between Spanish Rocks and Orote Point. The alternate entrance is very effective. In addition to the tests described above, induced current studies were made. Many of these were for the purpose of developing the technique of daytime photography of reflector <b>floats.</b> Because test <b>runs</b> {{at the end of the}} month are incomplete and do not comprise a logical unit for presentation, their analysis will appear in next month's report...|$|R
5000|$|In the East Blue, {{the pirate}} El Drago {{and his crew}} are searching for the {{treasure}} {{left behind by the}} legendary [...] "Great Gold Pirate" [...] Woonan, which {{is said to be a}} mountain of gold; El Drago eventually finds a treasure map to Woonan's gold by killing Wonnan's former crew. While traveling to the treasure, El Drago's men rob the Straw Hat Pirates, who have run out of food and are close to starving. Luffy attacks them and accidentally smashes their small boat in the process. El Drago retaliates using his Goe-Goe devil fruit powers, sending a powerful shock-wave that completely destroys the small boat and knocks the Going Merry away. Zoro dives into the sea to save Luffy, separating them from the rest of the Straw Hats, and finds Tobio, a small boy who was forced to work for El Drago. Smelling food, Luffy, Zoro and Tobio use the remains of the boat to travel to a <b>floating</b> oden shop <b>run</b> by Tobio's grandfather, Ganzo. Not having any cash, Luffy and Zoro accidentally perform an eat and run and are chained together by Ganzo.|$|R
