5|$|It {{is known}} McCudden proved remarkably good at {{stalking}} tactics, which {{enabled him to}} get up underneath an opponent, pull down the wing gun and <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> into the German machine. The first the recipients would know of the attack was bullets coming up through {{the bottom of the}} fuselage of the aircraft, often causing death or injury, holing petrol tanks and crippling engines. The gun, being fed by a drum of ammunition, could also be reloaded in its pulled-down position, the pilot having two or more spare drums located in his cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Intermittent deep {{convection}} {{continued to}} <b>fire</b> <b>up,</b> keeping the storm afloat {{for the next}} day and turning it away from the Azores. Danielle also changed direction and meandered slightly to the northwest, away from the Azores, due to very weak steering currents. After holding on as a minimal tropical storm, Danielle finally lost its deep convection due to high upper-level vertical shear and was downgraded to a tropical depression on the afternoon of August 20. The depression turned once again to the north, and continued to lose organization over cooler water. It degenerated into a remnant low on the afternoon of August 21 as the convection was completely sheared away from the center of Danielle. The remnant low remained in the open ocean, remaining devoid of any deep convection, until August 24 when it dissipated west-southwest of the Azores.|$|E
5|$|Transformers: Fall of Cybertron, {{like its}} {{predecessor}} , is a third-person shooter. Players can control each transformer in both its robot and vehicle forms. Instead {{of a traditional}} health system, the game features a system similar to the Halo series of video games. The player character has both a regenerating shield and health, the latter {{of which can be}} replenished by a health pack. The weapon selection in Fall of Cybertron is expanded, with new weapons that can take on very significant upgrades, including one that allows a weapon to <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to 75% faster. These are purchased through Teletran 1 kiosks found throughout the game.|$|E

5|$|Flowers and coins, {{as well as}} stars, are {{scattered}} about the game's stages. These are totaled {{at the end of}} each stage and a score is given depending how many of each were collected (a maximum of 30 stars, 20 red coins and 5 flowers). Sufficiently high scores are required to unlock one of the two sets of secret levels. (the other set being unlocked upon completing the game, similar to the GBA remake of the original game) Special character coins are also introduced. Missing from the game are the power-ups of sorts — like the ability to spit seeds by eating watermelons — which were present in the original. The fire breathing ability is retained though: Yoshi can use it when he snags a torch or fireball with his tongue. This allows him to shoot streams of <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to three times. Keys found in the stages unlock mini-games and doors that would be closed otherwise.|$|E
5|$|Titan uses Jaguar's 200 cabinets, {{covering}} 404 square meters (4,352 ft2), with replaced internals and upgraded networking. Reusing Jaguar's {{power and}} cooling systems saved approximately $20 million. Power is provided to each cabinet at three-phase 480 V. This requires thinner cables than the US standard 208 V, saving $1 million in copper. At its peak, Titan draws 8.2 MW, 1.2 MW more than Jaguar, but runs almost {{ten times as}} fast in terms of floating point calculations. In {{the event of a}} power failure, carbon fiber flywheel power storage can keep the networking and storage infrastructure running for up to 16 seconds. After 2 seconds without power, diesel generators <b>fire</b> <b>up,</b> taking approximately 7 seconds to reach full power. They can provide power indefinitely. The generators are designed only to keep the networking and storage components powered so that a reboot is much quicker; the generators are not capable of powering the processing infrastructure.|$|E

25|$|By contrast, each Gatling gun {{had to be}} hauled by four horses, and {{soldiers}} often had to drag the heavy guns by hand over obstacles. Each of the heavy, hand-cranked weapons could <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to 350 rounds a minute, an impressive rate, but they were known to jam frequently. During the Black Hills Expedition two years earlier, a Gatling gun had turned over, rolled down a mountain, and shattered to pieces.

25|$|The Type 94 37-mm AT gun was {{introduced}} in 1936. The design originated as an improvement to the Type 11 37 mm infantry gun, which was also used as a primitive anti-tank weapon. However, its short bore, low muzzle velocity, short range and slow reloading time gave it a limited capacity against enemy armor. Development of a replacement began in July 1933 and was completed a year later. Initial testing indicated that a trained crew could <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to 30 rounds per minute; however, Army planners felt that the initial design was too heavy. A modified design was tested in 1935, and actual production began in 1936; however, the weapon retained its original “Type 94” (imperial year 2594 = western year 1934) designation. Approximately 3,400 units were produced.|$|E
25|$|A {{well trained}} soldier could <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> to three rounds per minute, {{and the use}} of the platoon {{formation}} by the British army meant that a constant volley of fire could be employed. There was much that could go wrong with the musket– from misfires in wet weather, to the gun firing at random due to sparks which set the powder off. In the heat of battle a soldier may forget to remove the ramrod from the barrel before firing. Nonetheless, the musket proved to be an overall reliable weapon which's performance, especially when used en masse, should not be underestimated. Even though contemporary writers often state that a musket's effective range when firing at an individual target did not go beyond 30 paces, modern test firings at individual human-sized targets suggest that a musket's effective range lies somewhere between 70 and 100 yards.|$|E

25|$|After being {{completely}} dominated until this point, the Raiders offense finally struck back their next possession, advancing 79 yards in 9 plays, and scoring on a 23-yard touchdown pass from Daryle Lamonica to receiver Bill Miller. The score seemed to <b>fire</b> <b>up</b> the Raiders' defense, and they forced the Packers to punt on their next drive. Raiders returner Rodger Bird gave them great field position with a 12-yard return to Green Bay's 40-yard line, but Oakland could only gain 1 yard with their next 3 plays {{and came up}} empty when George Blanda's 47-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts. Oakland's defense again forced Green Bay to punt after 3 plays on the ensuing drive, but this time after calling for a fair catch, Bird fumbled punter Donny Anderson's twisting, left footed kick, and Green Bay's Dick Capp recovered the ball. After 2 incomplete passes, Starr threw a 9-yard completion to Dowler to set up Chandler's third field goal from the 43 as time expired in the first half, giving the Packers a 16–7 lead.|$|E
