"The Independent clergyman," [...] {{she said}} in a low meditative tone, [...] "has only two hundred a year--so I'm told; an' the doctor at the west end has got four hundred, and he keeps a fine house an' servants; an' Sam Balls, the rich hosier, has got six hundred--so they say; and Mrs Gaff, the poor critter, has only got five hundred! That'll do," [...] she continued, with a sudden burst of animation, [...] "shake out the reefs in yer tops'ls, lass, slack off yer sheets, <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm,</b> an' make the most on it while the fair wind lasts." ...|$|E

60|$|The vessel {{felt the}} slight change, and drew faster through the foaming brine, {{bringing}} us, with increasing velocity, nearer to the dreaded point. As {{we came up}} to the promontory the water fell back in spray on the decks, and there was an instant when it appeared as if the wind was about to desert us. Happily the ship had drawn so far ahead as to feel the good effects of a slight change of current that was caused by the air rushing obliquely into the cove; and, as Noah, by <b>easing</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> still more, had anticipated this alteration, which had been felt adversely but a moment before, while struggling to the eastward of the promontory, we drew swiftly past the icy cape, opening the cove handsomely, with the ship's head falling off fast towards the gorge.|$|R
6000|$|A big, foaming sea {{came out}} of the mist; it made for the ship, roaring wildly, and in its rush it looked as mischievous and discomposing as a madman with an axe. One or two, shouting, {{scrambled}} up the rigging; most, with a convulsive catch of the breath, held on where they stood. Singleton dug his knees under the wheel-box, and carefully <b>eased</b> <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> to <b>the</b> headlong pitch of the ship, but without taking his eyes off the coming wave. It towered close-to and high, like a wall of green glass topped with snow. The ship rose to it as though she had soared on wings, and for a moment rested poised upon the foaming crest {{as if she had been}} a great sea-bird. Before we could draw breath a heavy gust struck her, another roller took her unfairly under the weather bow, she gave a toppling lurch, and filled her decks. Captain Allistoun leaped up, and fell; Archie rolled over him, screaming:--"She will rise!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you're right, Griffin. <b>Ease</b> {{her with}} <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> a little, Mr. Yelverton. If Master Yvard stands on his present course an hour longer, Biguglia {{would be too}} far to {{windward}} for him; and as for Bastia, that {{has been out of}} the question from the first. There is a river called Golo, into which he might run; and that, I rather think, is his aim. Four hours, however, will let us into his secret." ...|$|R
6000|$|What a revulsion {{of feeling}} {{came over me}} at this sight! A minute before, and I was {{completely}} isolated; {{cut off from the}} rest of my species, and resigned to a fate that seemed to command my quitting this state of being, without further communion with mankind. Everything was changed. Here was the companion of so many former dangers, the man who had taught me my profession, one that I can truly say I loved, quite near me, and possibly dying for the want of that aid which I might render! I was on deck in the twinkling of an eye; <b>the</b> sheets were <b>eased</b> off, and <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> put up. Obedient to my wishes, the ship fell off, and I soon got a glimpse, from the spot where I stood, at the wheel, of the wreck a little clear of the weather cat-head. By this time, the wind was so light, and the ship had got to be so deep in the water, that the motion of the last was very slow. Even with <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> up, it scarce equalled half a knot; I began to fear I should not be able to reach my goal, after all! ...|$|R
60|$|Having {{applied a}} rope's-end to the {{shoulders}} {{of one of the}} other sleepers, he repeated his orders to <b>ease</b> off <b>the</b> sheets, as the wind was fair, and staggered back to his place at <b>the</b> <b>helm.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Then let her go," [...] and as Jim <b>eased</b> off on <b>the</b> sheet the old craft {{came around}} slowly, {{for she was}} by no means prompt in {{answering}} <b>the</b> <b>helm.</b>|$|R
60|$|The sail swelled {{between the}} {{confining}} ropes, {{there was a}} noise {{on one side of}} the yacht, water foamed along the planks, and she began to swing. It looked as if the steersman were putting up <b>the</b> <b>helm.</b> <b>The</b> peak of the gaff was nearly down; with another good pull they could seize it and lash it to the boom. Then a dazzling flash touched the deck. Marston saw Wyndham run aft and push the Kroo from the wheel, but this was the last he saw clearly for sometime. He imagined the fellow had meant to run the yacht off before the squall; one could <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> strain of a sudden blast like that, but if the squall lasted, they could not shorten sail while she was before the wind. Now she was coming round. Wyndham had put <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> down. It looked as if he were too late.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his first}} acts as bishop, Hanifen {{selected}} St. Mary's Church as the cathedral of the diocese, and launched The Catholic Herald, the monthly diocesan newspaper, in September 1984. He emphasized {{collaboration with the}} laity, appointing them to leadership positions within <b>the</b> diocese to <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> burden of the clergy. He also supported ecumenism and interfaith dialogue, even co-founding the Center for Christian-Jewish Dialogue with Rabbi Howard Hirsch. During Hanifen's nearly two decades as <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> of <b>the</b> diocese, the number of Catholics and parishes nearly doubled.|$|R
50|$|The future {{surrounding}} Ange Postecoglou's {{future at}} the club were ended on 18 March 2011, {{when it was announced}} by both the FFA, who were financially aiding the club after the Roar's license was taken back to <b>ease</b> <b>the</b> burden on the owners, and the club that the reigning Manager of the Year had signed a 2-year addition to his current contract that would see him at <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> for <b>the</b> Roar {{until the end of the}} 2013-14 season, assuring he would coach the team through the 2012 Asian Champions League.|$|R
50|$|As Cold War {{tensions}} <b>eased</b> in <b>the</b> late 1980s {{under the}} liberalising reforms of Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Honecker refused all but cosmetic {{changes to the}} East German political system and was consequently forced to resign by his party in October 1989 as the Communist regime sought to retain its power.

2500|$|Slocum {{normally}} sailed the Spray {{without touching}} <b>the</b> <b>helm.</b> Due to <b>the</b> {{length of the}} sail plan relative to the hull, and the long keel, the Spray was capable of self-steering (unlike faster modern craft), and he balanced it stably on any course relative to the wind by adjusting or reefing the sails and by lashing <b>the</b> <b>helm</b> fast.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Helm</b> Wind of Cross Fell, North Pennines, is England's only named wind. As {{a product}} of the {{particular}} landscape found at Cross Fell, <b>the</b> <b>Helm</b> is a true local wind, and a phenomenon that has come to assume great cultural as well as environmental significance in the region and beyond. In this paper we draw on material from county histories, newspaper archives, and documents relating to investigations of <b>the</b> <b>Helm</b> Wind that were conducted by the Royal Meteorological Society between 1884 and 1889, and by British climatologist Gordon Manley (1908 – 1980), between 1937 and 1939, to document attempts to observe, measure, understand and explain this local wind over a period of 200 years. We show how different ways of knowing <b>the</b> <b>Helm</b> relate to contemporary practices of meteorology, highlighting the shifts that took place in terms of what constituted credible meteorological observation. We also acknowledge the overlapping nature of these ways of knowing and the persistence of multiple testimonies about <b>the</b> <b>Helm</b> and its effects...|$|R
