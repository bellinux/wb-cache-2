5|$|By June 2007, {{the project}} was delayed by half a year. One of the major delays in the project has been the {{development}} of the software for the health sector's communication centers—which consist of emergency wards, casualty wards, emergency dispatch centers and aircraft coordination centers. The system is being developed by Frequentis in Austria, who have stated that they did not receive sufficient specifications. In December 2009, the state granted NOK110 million extra for development of the system. Health workers will therefore be taking the network into use in May 2010, after the police and fire departments in Follo and Østfold. Representatives for the Police Directorate have criticized the <b>implementation</b> <b>model</b> and stated that in most other countries, the system was implemented first just for the police and afterwards taken into use by the fire and paramedic agencies. For instance, Østfold Police District had installed a new center in February 2008, but had to wait 21 months to take it into use while waiting for Public Safety Radio.|$|E

50|$|Many {{implementations}} of Composition filters exists(including SmallTalk and Java Implementations). The {{advantage of}} existing implementations {{is that there}} is no difference between the conceptual and <b>implementation</b> <b>model,</b> which makes it easier to understand the implementation of certain features.

One implementation in Java, namely ComposeJ, addressed this problem by using a compile-time oriented source modification approach.|$|E
40|$|As the {{complexity}} of systems and environments increases, the system developers face difficulties in building distribute virtual environment (DVE) systems. Primary challenges {{that have to be}} addressed by these developers are compensating network latency jitters, maintaining system-wide data consistency, enabling fair resource sharing and interaction between the users, and providing scalability. Recently we have been exploring a new approach towards DVEs, addressing two major concurrency problems, (1) the fair request handling and (2) the system-wide data consistency. The global timestamp based approach is reviewed here together with two different <b>implementation</b> <b>models.</b> To improve the scalability of the approach, two different hierarchical <b>implementation</b> <b>models</b> are considered in this paper and a proof-of-concept system is presented with the measured performance data...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{complete}} scenario for {{the provision of}} interactive multimedia services over the Internet is considered, exploiting emerging software methodologies that implement different aspects of what is called the object web. Initially, web-application design considerations over the years are presented, in parallel to the evolution of the World Wide Web. Then, the study focuses on a distributed multimedia application aiming to deliver, over the Internet, information on children's TV programs and co-productions. Two different object oriented <b>implementation</b> <b>models</b> are described, the HTTP/Microsoft's active server pages (ASP) approach and the Java/common object request broker architecture (CORBA) approach. Finally, experimental results comparing the two <b>implementation</b> <b>models</b> are presented and the advantages gained from the latter are highlighted. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} complexity and heterogeneity of modern System-on-Chip designs demands early consideration and exploration of architectural alternatives, which is hardly practicable {{on the low}} abstraction level of <b>implementation</b> <b>models.</b> In this paper, a system level design methodology based on the SystemC 2. 0 library is proposed, which enables the designer to reason about the architecture on a much higher level of abstraction. Goal of this methodology is to define a system architecture, which provides sufficient performance, flexibility and cost efficiency as required by demanding applications like broadband networking or wireless communications. The methodology also provides capabilities for co-simulating multiple levels of abstraction simultaneously. This enables reuse of the simulation environment for functional verification of synthesizable <b>implementation</b> <b>models</b> against the abstract architecture model...|$|R
