5|$|An inept batsman with {{an average}} of 5.78 in his {{first-class}} career, Toshack managed a Test average of 51.00 on the 1948 tour after being dismissed only once, behind only Arthur Morris, Sid Barnes, Bradman and Neil Harvey. The unbeaten 20 he managed in the Lord's Test was his best first-class score, made in a <b>freewheeling</b> tenth-wicket stand with Johnston.|$|E
5|$|Senator McCarthy's zeal {{to uncover}} {{subversion}} and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers {{of people who}} were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His <b>freewheeling</b> style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings.... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.|$|E
5|$|Toshack's {{performance}} in the First Test at Trent Bridge was a quiet one, taking a single wicket in each innings. England won the toss and elected to bat. Toshack trapped the home captain Norman Yardley leg before wicket with a ball that straightened after pitching, ending with 1/28 as England were bowled out for 165. Toshack then came to the wicket at 9/476 and was involved in an aggressive final wicket partnership of 33 with Johnston, scoring 19runs—his best at Test level to date—in just 18minutes, batting in a carefree and <b>freewheeling</b> manner, before falling lbw to Alec Bedser, ending Australia's innings on 509 with a 344-run lead.|$|E
50|$|Pedaling forces tighten a <b>freewheel</b> {{onto the}} hub, so no tool is {{required}} to install one. The ratcheting mechanism prevents the <b>freewheel</b> being loosened when the sprockets are turned counter-clockwise. A <b>freewheel</b> can {{be removed from the}} hub with one of the many specific <b>freewheel</b> removal tools that engages a spline or set of notches on the outboard end of the <b>freewheel.</b> Removal often requires considerable effort due to the large torque that tightens the <b>freewheel</b> during pedaling, and some <b>freewheels</b> cannot be removed intact. Future removal of a <b>freewheel</b> is facilitated by grease on the <b>freewheel</b> threads before installation.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Freewheel</b> - The {{mechanism}} {{that allows the}} rider to coast {{is not part of}} the hub, it is contained in a separate <b>freewheel</b> body. The hub has threads that allow the <b>freewheel</b> body to be screwed on, and the <b>freewheel</b> body has threads or splines for fitting sprockets, or in the case of most single speed <b>freewheels</b> an integral sprocket. This style of hub was used before the freehub became practical.|$|R
50|$|Various <b>freewheel</b> removers {{are used}} to unscrew <b>freewheels</b> from hubs.|$|R
5|$|After the break, Hassett {{reached his}} century after 305 minutes of batting, his first in Tests in England. He then accelerated, adding a further 37 runs in 49 minutes before being bowled by Bedser, having struck 20 fours and a six. The {{dismissal}} ended an eighth-wicket partnership of 107 with Lindwall, who {{was caught by}} Evans down the leg side four runs later, having scored 42 with seven fours. Australia's last-wicket pair of Johnston and Toshack wagged a further 33 runs in only 18 minutes, batting in a carefree and <b>freewheeling</b> manner, before Bedser trapped Toshack to end the innings at 509, leaving the tourists with a 344-run lead. Australia had batted for 216.2 overs, the longest innings in terms of overs and the highest total in the series. Yardley placed {{the majority of the}} bowling load on his spinners; Young (1/79) and Laker (4/138) delivered 60 and 55 overs respectively. Bedser bowled 44.2 overs, taking 3/113. The part-time seam bowlers, Edrich, Barnett and Yardley, bowled 18, 17 and 17 overs respectively. Australia had scored slowly but they had no need to take risks when there was so much time remaining. Yardley's leg theory tactics failed to coax them into losing their patience.|$|E
25|$|<b>Freewheeling</b> {{unicycle}}, a unicycle {{in which}} the hub has a freewheel mechanism, allowing the rider, to coast or move forward without pedaling, as a common bicycle does. These unicycles almost always have brakes because they cannot stop the way traditional unicycles do. The brake lever is generally mounted {{in the bottom of}} the saddle. These unicycles also cannot go backwards.|$|E
25|$|She {{studied at}} the University of Queensland, where she met and had a brief affair with Zell Rabin, who gave Lillian her first job in America and who became a key {{associate}} of Rupert Murdoch in the early 1960s. She pursued further studies at the University of Sydney from 1949, where she fell in with the <b>freewheeling</b> movement known as the Sydney Push, then congregating at the Lincoln Inn.|$|E
50|$|The major {{disadvantage}} {{of the multiple}} sprocket <b>freewheel</b> design is that the drive-side bearing is located inboard of the <b>freewheel,</b> and as sprockets were added over time, moved the bearing farther from the drive-side axle support. This resulted in more flexing stress being placed on the axle, which can bend or even break. Multiple speed <b>freewheels</b> were common on quality high end bikes until the late 1980s. Suntour — Maeda Industries (Japan) introduced a compact 6 speed <b>freewheel</b> which reduced the spacing between the sprockets and was the same width as a standard 5 speed <b>freewheel</b> but required a narrower chain than the standard. The concept was copied by European <b>freewheel</b> manufacturers Regina (Italy) and Maillard (France). As the number of sprockets on a multiple <b>freewheel</b> increased clusters became physically wider, the freehub design overcame the axle/bearing problem with threaded hubs and began to supersede the <b>freewheel</b> design. Today it is rare to find a <b>freewheel</b> on a new bicycle with more than seven speeds. Some new single-speed — especially BMX and utility bikes — and lower-end multi-geared bicycles continue to be manufactured and sold with <b>freewheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|In {{the older}} style of bicycle, where the <b>freewheel</b> {{mechanism}} {{is included in}} the gear assembly, the system is called a <b>freewheel,</b> whereas the newer style, in which the <b>freewheel</b> mechanism is in the hub, is called a freehub.|$|R
25|$|This {{configuration}} {{consists of}} a left crank arm with a spider and chainring, and a right crank arm without a spider, the opposite of a normal configuration. If used with a screw-on <b>freewheel,</b> a special hub with a left hand thread for a special <b>freewheel</b> must be used , which is also threaded left hand and ratchets {{the opposite direction of}} a normal <b>freewheel.</b> If the <b>freewheel</b> and hub were threaded with right hand threads, the torque applied by pedaling would loosen and unthread the <b>freewheel</b> from the hub.|$|R
25|$|The album {{not only}} helped {{establish}} Danny!'s <b>freewheeling</b> and emotional persona (a sharp contrast from the cynical and extremely sarcastic characteristics he would reveal on subsequent albums), but also helped reiterate the ethic of DIY {{used by many}} emerging underground hip-hop artists at the time, such as Little Brother, Lupe Fiasco and Tanya Morgan, who too would see moderate popularity on the Internet translate into a recording contract with major or independent record labels.|$|E
25|$|They are {{the product}} of a reductive {{abstracting}} process, of an open, <b>freewheeling</b> process of synthesis—where a dialogue between components lead to the liberation from any particular classical foundation. They are combined harmoniously though pictographic imagery rendered in residuum abstractions of apparent mathematical codes. In the case of Metzinger, his prowess in mathematics is well documented. In the case of Picasso, the mathematical association with his paintings has been made through Maurice Princet.|$|E
25|$|Noble hosts his {{own show}} on Dave titled <b>Freewheeling.</b> Described as an anti-travelogue around Britain, {{in the show}} Noble takes the {{freestyle}} philosophy he embraces in his live shows and utilizes his trademark audience participation gimmick and transfers it to television as he rides around the UK on his motorbike taking live requests on Twitter instructing him on where he should go next, making the road trip entirely unpredictable. It airs on October 29.|$|E
50|$|The ISO {{threading}} for <b>freewheels</b> (Single or Multiple Speed) is {{the same}} as for track/fixed cogs. A standard single speed BMX style <b>freewheel</b> can be used on the track threads the hub. Because of the stepped down lock ring threads, not as many threads of the <b>freewheel</b> engage the hub threads as they would if it were threaded to a <b>freewheel</b> threads, however, this is not a problem since the same number of threads are sufficient to secure a track cog. The force applied to a <b>freewheel</b> {{is the same}} as that applied to a fixed cog of the same size, so the missing threads cause no durability issue. Also, there is never any reverse torque on the threads with a <b>freewheel,</b> so a <b>freewheel</b> actually puts less strain on the threads than a fixed cog does.|$|R
5000|$|The Shimano Front <b>Freewheel</b> (FFS) was a {{proprietary}} bicycle drivetrain {{design of the}} 1970s that placed a <b>freewheel</b> between the pedal cranks and the front chainrings [...] - [...] enabling the rider to shift gears while coasting. FFS rear <b>freewheel</b> is different than a standard <b>freewheel</b> because it's [...] "stiff" [...] with more friction than a normal rear <b>freewheel.</b> It will slip if necessary however, to stop the chain in the event of, for example, a clothing tangle [...] - [...] which could otherwise lead to injuries of the leg by the drivetrain, crashing of the bicycle, or both.|$|R
50|$|Most units had Standard Mechanical Transmission. This {{comprised}} a fluid coupling, a <b>freewheel</b> and a four-speed epicyclic pre-selector gearbox. The <b>freewheel</b> facilitated gear-changing {{and also}} had an important safety function. If an engine seized, the <b>freewheel</b> would disengage and give protection against transmission damage and possible derailment.|$|R
25|$|The {{additional}} PN junction blocks {{reverse current}} flow. This means that unlike a MOSFET, IGBTs cannot conduct in the reverse direction. In bridge circuits, where reverse current flow is needed, an additional diode (called a <b>freewheeling</b> diode) {{is placed in}} parallel (actually anti-parallel) with the IGBT to conduct current in the opposite direction. The penalty isn't overly severe because at higher voltages, where IGBT usage dominates, discrete diodes have a significantly higher performance than the body diode of a MOSFET.|$|E
25|$|During this period, Cromwell was {{continuing}} {{to enjoy the}} various invitations coming his way {{as a member of}} the A-list Hollywood social circuit. According to Bob Thomas, in his biography of Joan Crawford, Cromwell was a regular at the Saturday Night dinner parties of his former co-star Franchot Tone and then-wife Crawford. Other guests whom Cromwell dined with there included Barbara Stanwyck and then-husband Frank Fay, and William Haines and Jimmy Rogers. During the <b>freewheeling</b> heyday of West L.A. nightlife in the late 30s, Cromwell is said by author Charles Higham to have carried on a sometime, though obviously very discreet, affair with aviator and businessman Howard Hughes.|$|E
25|$|Lyrical {{abstraction}} shares similarities {{with color}} field painting and abstract expressionism {{especially in the}} <b>freewheeling</b> usage of paint — texture and surface. Direct drawing, calligraphic use of line, the effects of brushed, splattered, stained, squeegeed, poured, and splashed paint superficially resemble the effects seen in abstract expressionism and color field painting. However the styles are markedly different. Setting it apart from abstract expressionism and action painting of the 1940s and 1950s is the approach to composition and drama. As seen in action painting there is an emphasis on brushstrokes, high compositional drama, dynamic compositional tension. While in lyrical abstraction {{there is a sense}} of compositional randomness, all over composition, low key and relaxed compositional drama and an emphasis on process, repetition, and an all over sensibility.|$|E
25|$|Vehicles {{using two}} <b>freewheels.</b> A <b>freewheel,</b> as {{used on a}} pedal bicycle for example, allows a road wheel to rotate faster than the {{mechanism}} that drives it, allowing a cyclist to stop pedalling while going downhill. Some early automobiles had the engine driving two <b>freewheels,</b> one for each driving road wheel. When the vehicle turned, the engine would continue to drive the wheel {{on the inside of}} the curve, but the wheel on the outside was permitted to rotate faster by its <b>freewheel.</b> Thus, while turning, the vehicle had only one driving wheel. Driving in reverse is impossible as is engine braking due to the <b>freewheels.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the lack}} of {{popularity}} for the <b>freewheel,</b> it was not continuously re-engineered to be more useful for several decades. In 1899, American manufacturers developed the “coaster brake,” which allowed riders to brake by pedaling backwards and included the <b>freewheel</b> mechanism. [...] At the turn of the century, bicycle manufacturers within Europe and America included the <b>freewheel</b> mechanism in a majority of their bicycles but now the <b>freewheel</b> was incorporated in the rear sprocket of a bicycle unlike Van Anden’s initial design.|$|R
50|$|If the hub has no <b>freewheel</b> {{mechanism}} {{built into}} it, then a front <b>freewheel</b> is required, which screws onto the crank. These were initially taken from BMX or singlespeed/utility bikes {{and use the}} same threads as screw-on rear hubs. It was found that most BMX <b>freewheels</b> weren't strong enough for trials use {{and for this reason}} trials specific <b>freewheels</b> were designed. Trials <b>freewheels</b> are available with up to 120 clicks per revolution to give excellent drive pickup. Since the torque capacity of the <b>freewheel</b> must be extremely high (Fitted to the crank the <b>freewheel</b> will see the highest torques in the bike drivetrain), instead of making a ratchet with 120 teeth and small ratchet pawls to engage them, the ratchet ring has 40 deep teeth which are less prone to chipping or rounding. These are engaged by 3 ratchet pawls at a time, with 9 in total in the <b>freewheel.</b> Each set of 3 pawls is offset by 1/120 of a revolution from the previous set. This is either achieved by using identical pawls with slight offsets in the machining of the seats for the pawls or by having the pawls in each set of 3 pawls shorter or longer than the other sets of 3.|$|R

25|$|With {{increasing}} Christian missionary {{activity and}} growing European {{settlement in the}} 1830s, and with growing lawlessness in New Zealand, the British Crown acceded to repeated requests from missionaries and some chiefs to intervene. Some <b>freewheeling</b> escaped convicts and seamen, as well as gunrunners and Americans actively worked against the British government by spreading rumours amongst the Māori {{that the government would}} oppress and mistreat them. Tamati Waka Nene, a pro-government chief, was angry that the government had not taken active steps to stop gunrunners selling weapons to rebels in Hokianga. In addition, the French were showing imminent interest in acquiring New Zealand to add to their stake in Polynesia. British immigrants believed that the French Catholic missionaries were spreading anti-British feeling. All of the chiefs who spoke against the Treaty on 5 February 1840 were Catholic. Years after the treaty was signed, Bishop Pompallier admitted that all the Catholic chiefs and especially Rewa, had consulted him for advice.|$|E
25|$|Lyrical Abstraction in {{the late}} 1960s is {{characterized}} by the paintings of Dan Christensen,Ronnie Landfield, Peter Young and others, and along with the Fluxus movement and Postminimalism (a term first coined by Robert Pincus-Witten in the pages of Artforum in 1969) sought to expand the boundaries of abstract painting and Minimalism by focusing on process, new materials and new ways of expression. Postminimalism often incorporating industrial materials, raw materials, fabrications, found objects, installation, serial repetition, and often with references to Dada and Surrealism is best exemplified in the sculptures of Eva Hesse. Lyrical Abstraction, Conceptual Art, Postminimalism, Earth Art, Video, Performance art, Installation art, along with the continuation of Fluxus, Abstract Expressionism, Color Field painting, Hard-edge painting, Minimal Art, Op art, Pop art, Photorealism and New Realism extended the boundaries of Contemporary Art in the mid-1960s through the 1970s. Lyrical Abstraction is a type of <b>freewheeling</b> abstract painting that emerged in the mid-1960s when abstract painters returned to various forms of painterly, pictorial, expressionism with a predominate focus on process, gestalt and repetitive compositional strategies in general.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Freewheels</b> are {{available}} in sizes 13T to 28T {{and in the same}} two different widths as the cogs (3/32" [...] and 1/8"). ACS makes a special [...] "FAT" [...] heavy duty BMX <b>freewheel</b> in 14T and 16T with 3/16" [...] teeth compatible only with 3/16" [...] chains. ACS also makes a 15T <b>freewheel</b> that accepts a 3/32" [...] chain.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>freewheel</b> segment, {{installed}} {{inside the}} rear differential, lets rear wheels rotate faster than front wheels without locking the viscous coupling and preventing ABS from applying brakes to each wheel independently. Because of the <b>freewheel,</b> torque {{can be transferred}} to rear axle only when the vehicle is moving forward. For four-wheel drive to work when reversing, a vacuum-actuated [...] "throttle control element" [...] is installed on the differential case. This device locks the <b>freewheel</b> mechanism when in reverse gear. The <b>freewheel</b> mechanism unlocks when the gear-shift lever is pushed to the right, past the third gear. The <b>freewheel</b> is not unlocked immediately after leaving reverse gear on purpose - this is to prevent the <b>freewheel</b> from cycling from locked to unlocked if the car is stuck and driver is trying to [...] "rock" [...] the car by changing from first to reverse and back.|$|R
50|$|The {{usual way}} to use a {{flip-flop}} hub {{is to have a}} fixed gear on one side, and a single speed <b>freewheel</b> on the other. Ideally, the <b>freewheel</b> sprocket would be one or two teeth larger than the fixed sprocket. This allows for extended hill climbs at a lower ratio than the fixed gear provides. The <b>freewheel</b> in this gear also allows the cyclist to coast on a steep descent.|$|R
500|$|The {{money was}} proffered with few strings attached: J. C. R. Licklider, then the {{director}} of ARPA, believed that his organization should [...] "fund people, not projects!" [...] and allowed researchers to pursue whatever directions might interest them. This created a <b>freewheeling</b> atmosphere at MIT {{that gave birth to}} the hacker culture, but this [...] "hands off" [...] approach would not last.|$|E
500|$|However, {{there was}} another issue: since {{the passage of the}} Mansfield Amendment in 1969, DARPA had been under {{increasing}} pressure to fund [...] "mission-oriented direct research, rather than basic undirected research". Funding for the creative, <b>freewheeling</b> exploration that had gone on in the 60s would not come from DARPA. Instead, the money was directed at specific projects with clear objectives, such as autonomous tanks and battle management systems.|$|E
500|$|Musician {{magazine}} {{said of the}} 1992 CD release: [...] "Of all the Beatles-related esoterica, this 1968 soundtrack {{album is}} one of the choicest treasures... a <b>freewheeling</b> tapestry of music and sound... a pastiche-like head trip with a mind all its own." [...] Billboards reviewer rated it a [...] "Vital Reissue" [...] (signifying a re-release or compilation that merits [...] "special artistic, archival, and commercial interest") and described the album as an [...] "often enchanting sequence of 19 harmonious themes and tone poems" [...] and an [...] "intriguing treat".|$|E
50|$|A <b>freewheel</b> {{mechanism}} {{allows a}} rider to stop pedalling whilst the cycle {{is still in}} forward motion. On a cycle without a <b>freewheel</b> mechanism, the rider has to keep pedalling whenever the cycle is moving.|$|R
50|$|By its nature, a <b>freewheel</b> {{mechanism}} acts as {{an automatic}} clutch, {{making it possible to}} change gears in a manual gearbox, either up- or downshifting, without depressing the clutch pedal, limiting the use of the manual clutch to starting from standstill or stopping. The Saab <b>freewheel</b> can be engaged or disengaged by the driver by respectively pushing or pulling a lever. This will lock or unlock the main shaft with the <b>freewheel</b> hub.|$|R
50|$|Some {{cars have}} a <b>freewheel</b> that {{disengages}} the driveshaft from the driven shaft. This {{happens when the}} driven shaft rotates faster than the driveshaft. For example, Saab used a <b>freewheel</b> system in the Saab 96 V4 and early Saab 99 for better fuel efficiency. It was also used in Saab's two-stroke models {{at the cost of}} engine braking. Some cars, such as the Rover P4, include a manual switch to engage or disengage the <b>freewheel.</b>|$|R
