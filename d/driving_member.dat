50|$|Wrap-spring clutches: These have a helical spring, {{typically}} wound with square-cross-section wire. These {{were developed}} in the late 19th and early 20th century. In simple form the spring is fastened at {{one end to the}} driven member; its other end is unattached. The spring fits closely around a cylindrical <b>driving</b> <b>member.</b> If the <b>driving</b> <b>member</b> rotates in the direction that would unwind the spring the spring expands minutely and slips although with some drag. Because of this, spring clutches must typically be lubricated with light oil. Rotating the <b>driving</b> <b>member</b> the other way makes the spring wrap itself tightly around the driving surface and the clutch locks up very quickly. The torque required to make a spring clutch slip grows exponentially with the number of turns in the spring, obeying the capstan equation.|$|E

50|$|In the {{simplest}} application, clutches connect and disconnect two rotating shafts (drive shafts or line shafts).

While typically the motions involved are rotary, linear clutches are also possible.|$|E

This Union was the first to adopt the cause of female {{suffrage}} in Australia. Bowes was president from 1885-1892, and remained active until her death eight years later. She was regarded as a powerful and engaging speaker. She felt that giving women voting rights would be an excellent means of establishing control over the sale and consumption of liquor. Bowes used contacts from her time in rural districts to set up new regional unions. Thanks to her substantial contribution to the movement, Bowes was voted honorary life president in 1893.|$|E
50|$|Cars use {{clutches}} {{in places}} {{other than the}} drive train. For example, a belt-driven engine cooling fan may have a heat-activated clutch. The driving and driven members are separated by a silicone-based fluid and a valve controlled by a bimetallic spring. When the temperature is low, the spring winds and closes the valve, which lets the fan spin at about 20% to 30% of the shaft speed. As {{the temperature of the}} spring rises, it unwinds and opens the valve, allowing fluid past the valve, makes the fan spin at about 60% to 90% of shaft speed. Other clutches—such as for an air conditioning compressor—electronically engage clutches using magnetic force to couple the <b>driving</b> <b>member</b> to the driven member.|$|E

40|$|These {{challenges}} {{have been}} recognised by the European Commission {{in a recent}} Communication to the European Council and the European Parliament 1 and have been translated into three fundamental policy objectives: (i) sustainability, i. e. environmental objectives, (ii) security of supply and (iii) competitiveness. However, an important question for Europe’s energy policy choices is to what extent trade-offs exist between these objectives. The Commission appears to suggest that all objectives reinforce each other. In contrast, this report points {{out that there are}} important national trade-offs behind these various policy objectives which need to be recognised in order to arrive at a robust framework for analysing the benefits of – and convincing Member States of the need for – a European approach. In this report we provide evidence of individual Member States’ performance in relation to the three objectives. We find that there is considerable heterogeneity in the accomplishment of each objective across Member States. This evidence is consistent with the existence of national trade-offs <b>driving</b> <b>Member</b> States towards different policy choices. Each Member State faces very different exogenous factors as regards geographical location and the availability of domestic primary energy resources, to say nothing of diverse national preferences, such as attitudes to nuclear energy. As a result of this considerable heterogeneity in energy markets, not all objectives can be achieved equally by all Member States. Or at least not at the same cost. National trade-offs exist, and to differing degrees, across Member States. This report provides some direct examples and evidence of national trade-offs. It is important to emphasise that we are not providing a comprehensive list of all possible trade-offs inherent in the three possible objectives. Such a list would depend on precise definition of the objectives. For instance, the objective of ‘competitiveness’ may have several dimensions, which may not all involve the same trade-offs. As discussed below, this report concentrates on one aspect of competitiveness, namely competition. To the extent that competitiveness is a broader concept than competition, more trade-offs need to be taken into account. We think that the correct way to analyse {{the costs and benefits of}} a European energy policy is to set the debate in terms of relaxing national trade-offs. Using this approach we identify five policy areas where national trade-offs could be significantly relaxed by the adoption of a common European approach: the internal market, a network of energy regulators, political framing, the choice of energy mix and a European plan for the development of new technologies. These five fields show that, despite national differences, a European policy can bring substantial added value. Finally, the report asks how a European energy policy can be made acceptable to Member States. We emphasise five priorities: (1) implementing flexible (marketbased) and harmonised incentive systems, (2) dealing with problem Member States, (3) focusing on energy objectives, (4) providing more rigorous impact assessments and (5) appealing to the special responsibility of France and Germany. We conclude by underlining that, if a European approach is not successful, mutually incoherent national policies will prevail. This will have long-lasting negative effects on the global competitiveness of European industry and will be an obstacle to environmental adjustment. In other words, all three objectives identified by the European Commission are at stake...|$|E

50|$|Boston Latin Academy (BLA) {{was founded}} on November 27, 1877, as Girls' Latin School (GLS). The school was founded {{as a result of}} citizen and parent {{participation}} with the intention to give college preparatory training to girls. A plan to admit girls to Public Latin School was formed by an executive committee of the Massachusetts Society for the University Education of Women. Three visionary and <b>driving</b> <b>members</b> of this executive committee, Emily Talbot, Florence Cushing, and Annie Fields deserve much of the credit for the school's founding. Henry Durant, president of Wellesley College {{and one of the most}} brilliant legal minds in Boston, was also greatly instrumental in outlining the legal route for the school to be established. A petition with a thousand signatures was presented to the School Board in September 1877. The board referred the question to the subcommittee on high schools. Meanwhile, Emily Talbot met with the headmaster of Public Latin School and asked that her daughter and another girl be admitted. Although Headmaster Moses Merrill was willing to teach the girls, he thought it best to wait for the subcommittee's decision. Ultimately the subcommittee recommended that a separate Latin School for girls be established.|$|R

This was {{followed}} by what was considered a radically different sounding second album, Hyperactive, which although gaining great reviews, the band were unable to capitalise on due to a lack of support from management or record company. Finally the band disbanded in 1986, resurfacing in 1995 at the request of fans during the height of Grunge releasing their third album Holy Wars, once again to critical acclaim. Albums followed in 1998, Babylon, and 2001, Xtreme Machine. A protracted hiatus then followed, fuelled by significant personal and family issues that were impacting all members of the band. The band resurfaced in 2011 with a new album Sons of Malice, again receiving significant critical acclaim with founding and <b>driving</b> <b>members</b> Chris Bradley and Andy Dawson, joined by Kris Bradley (Chris's son and Andys nephew) on guitar and Mark Nelson on drums.
