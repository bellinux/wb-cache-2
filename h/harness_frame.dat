40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{a class of}} high-speed airjet weaving machines that is characterized by excessive <b>harness</b> <b>frame</b> vibration, resulting in premature failure. This problem is tackled through addition of an auxiliary, input torque balancing mechanism: a centrifugal pendulum, of which the pendulum motion is imposed by an internal cam. While earlier work by the same authors focused on the design, optimization and robustness analysis of this mechanism, the current paper presents experimental results. The considered setup is an industrial weaving machine a blanc equipped with a centrifugal pendulum prototype. Below a critical speed, the prototype functions as predicted and signicantly improves the machine dynamics: the drive speed uctuation is reduced {{by a factor of}} 2. 5 and the vibration level of the harness frames is halved. Above the critical speed, however, torsional resonance dominates the machine dynamics. This phenomenon is veried on simulation by extending the rigid-body setup model, on which the centrifugal pendulum design is based, with a torsional degree of freedom...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} of {{open source software}} (OSS) has changed the philosophy and practice of software development, implementation and ownership; a phenomenon which also has influenced interpretations, actions and behaviors of organizational members. This research explicates the interpretations and subsequent actions of key stakeholder groups towards OSS during the implementation of an OSS-based IS in a public sector organization in Ethiopia. Drawing upon the technological frames analytical framework, the study shows that the key stakeholder groups interpreted openness of the software and the community model of software implementation differently leading them to entertain divergent actions. Users were keen to solving operational problems via readymade IS with a third party support, while the management and technologists were focusing on the strategic importance of OSS not only to their own organization {{but also to the}} nation in general. Perception differences led to alliance formation, political processes, and change of management style. The study shows that as multiple interrelated elements shape the technological frames of groups, the relationship between frame incongruence and implementation is also complex and contextual. The study proposes technological frame analysis {{as an integral part of}} OSS implementation and a carefully crafted intervention to <b>harness</b> <b>frame</b> incongruence, if any...|$|E

The board swings in an arc which is a similar movement to riding a half pipe. The incorporation of a <b>harness</b> and <b>frame</b> allows the rider to perform turns spins all while flying though the air.|$|R
5000|$|The Power line all use {{the same}} seat <b>harness</b> and <b>frame</b> assembly. Most models also use the Solo 210 engine, {{combining}} it with different diameter propellers and protection cages to create higher thrust models. The model numbers correspond to the propeller diameter in centimetres and also indicate the maximum pilot weight in kilograms. The Power 70 model uses direct drive, but the 95, 115 and 30 models all use a reduction drive. These can be converted from one model to another more powerful one by mounting a larger propeller and protection cage to accommodate heavier pilot weights. Standard fuel is [...]|$|R

5000|$|Ašvieniai are divine {{twins in}} the Lithuanian mythology, {{identical}} to Latvian Dieva deli and the Baltic counterparts of Vedic Ashvins. Both names {{derive from the}} same Proto-Indo-European root for the horse - *ek'w-. Old Lithuanian ašva and Sanskrit ashva mean [...] "horse". Ašvieniai are represented as pulling a carriage of Saulė (the Sun) through the sky. Ašvieniai, depicted as žirgeliai or little horses, are common motifs on Lithuanian rooftops, placed for protection of the house. Similar motifs {{can also be found}} on beehives, <b>harnesses,</b> bed <b>frames,</b> and other household objects. Ašvieniai are related to Lithuanian Ūsinis and Latvian Ūsiņš (cf. Vedic Ushas), gods of horses.|$|R

50|$|Grassland is a {{historic}} house at Annapolis Junction, Anne Arundel County, Maryland. It was built in 1853, and is a three-part brick structure constructed in a telescoping manner. Other structures on the property are the one-story frame slave house with brick-nogged walls, a small stone smokehouse, {{the remains of a}} summer kitchen, and a <b>frame</b> <b>harness</b> shed, storage shed, and the ruins of a bank barn. The outbuildings are known to have been erected between 1852 and 1854 by the plantation slaves.|$|R
40|$|Glottal-synchronous speech {{processing}} {{is a field}} of speech science where the pseudoperiodicity of voiced speech is exploited. Traditionally, {{speech processing}} involves segmenting and processing short speech frames of predefined length; this may fail to exploit the inherent periodic structure of voiced speech which glottal-synchronous speech frames {{have the potential to}} <b>harness.</b> Glottal-synchronous <b>frames</b> are often derived from the glottal closure instants (GCIs) and glottal opening instants (GOIs). The SIGMA algorithm was developed for the detection of GCIs and GOIs from the Electroglottograph signal with a measured accuracy of up to 99. 59 %. For GCI and GOI detection from speech signals, the YAGA algorithm provides a measured accuracy of up to 99. 84 %. Multichannel speech-based approaches are shown to be more robust to reverberation than single-channel algorithms. The GCIs are applied to real-world applications including speech dereverberation, where SNR is improved by up to 5 dB, and to prosodic manipulation where the importance of voicing detection in glottal-synchronous algorithms is demonstrated by subjective testing. The GCIs are further exploited in a new area of data-driven speech modelling, providing new insights into speech production and a set of tools to aid deployment into real-world applications. The technique is shown to be applicable in areas of speech coding, identification and artificial bandwidth extension of telephone speechEThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
50|$|Firefighting {{equipment}} in the United States is based on lightweight materials developed for the U.S. Space Program. NASA and the National Bureau of Standards created a lightweight breathing system including face mask, <b>frame,</b> <b>harness,</b> and air bottle, using an aluminum composite material developed by NASA for use on rocket casings. The broadest fire-related technology transfer is the breathing apparatus for protection from smoke inhalation injury. Additionally, NASA’s inductorless electronic circuit technology led to lower-cost, more rugged, short-range two-way radio now used by firefighters. NASA also helped develop a specialized mask weighing less than 3 oz to protect the physically impaired from injuries to the face and head, as well as flexible, heat-resistant materials—developed to protect the space shuttle on reentry—which are being used both by the military and commercially in suits for municipal and aircraft-rescue firefighters.|$|R
