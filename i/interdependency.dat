5|$|The 2010 {{eruption}} of Eyjafjallajokull in Iceland highlighted {{the impacts of}} volcanic ash fall in modern society and our dependence on the functionality of infrastructure services. During this event the airline industry suffered business interruption losses of €1.5-2.5 billion from the closure of European airspace for six days in April 2010 and subsequent closures into May 2010. Ash fall from this event is also known to have caused local crop losses in agricultural industries, losses in the tourism industry, destruction of roads and bridges in Iceland (in combination with glacial melt water), and costs associated with emergency response and clean-up. However, across Europe there were further losses associated with travel disruption, the insurance industry, the postal service, and imports and exports across Europe and worldwide. These consequences demonstrate the <b>interdependency</b> and diversity of impacts from a single event.|$|E
5|$|The provincial presidents were {{appointed}} by the national government and were, in theory, charged with governing the province. In practice, however, their power was intangible, varying from province to province based upon each president's relative degree of personal influence and personal character. Since the national government wanted to ensure their loyalty, presidents were, in most cases, sent to a province {{in which they had}} no political, familial or other ties. In order to prevent them from developing any strong local interests or support, presidents would be limited to terms of only a few months in office. As the president usually {{spent a great deal of}} time away from the province, often traveling to their native province or the imperial capital, the de facto governor was the vice-president, who was chosen by the Provincial Assembly and was usually a local politician. With little power to undermine provincial autonomy, the president was an agent of the central government with little function beyond conveying its interests to the provincial political bosses. Presidents could be used by the national government to influence, or even rig, elections, although to be effective the president had to rely on provincial and local politicians who belonged to his own political party. This <b>interdependency</b> created a complex relationship which was based upon exchanges of favors, private interests, party goals, negotiations, and other political maneuvering.|$|E

Biological <b>interdependency</b> takes many forms in the forest, from species relying on other species for pollination and seed dispersal to predator-prey relationships to symbiotic relationships.

25|$|In a large open-air theatre, {{like the}} Theatre of Dionysus in Athens, the {{classical}} masks {{were able to}} create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions. They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself. Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as The Furies in Aeschylus' Eumenides and Pentheus and Cadmus in Euripides' The Bacchae. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged <b>interdependency</b> and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.|$|E
25|$|In this schema, {{three main}} {{prerequisites}} are posited for globalization to occur. The {{first is the}} idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East. Without the traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did. The second is distance. The interactions amongst states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe. With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within close proximity. Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and another phase of globalization was able to occur. The third has to do with <b>interdependency,</b> stability, and regularity. If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other. This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to function. This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization. It is argued that archaic globalization did not function in a similar manner to modern globalization because states were not as interdependent on others as they are today.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCapitalizing on inter-project <b>interdependencies</b> {{is widely}} {{accepted}} as being crucial for Information Technology/Information Systems (IT/IS) project portfolio success. However, handling these <b>interdependencies</b> becomes {{a source of}} increased management complexity as project portfolios get larger, increasingly diverse, and are much influenced by their environments. This then can lead to less predictable situations regarding the portfolio performance as a whole. Though there are many methods available for optimally selecting projects and cross-checking possible synergies and <b>interdependencies</b> among the projects in the portfolio, it remains unclear how one can gain control over the complexity of managing these <b>interdependencies.</b> In this study, we {{address the problem of}} handling many project <b>interdependencies</b> that continuously change and develop within a large IT/IS project portfolio.

The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island.

Social networks operate on many levels, from families up to the level of nations, and {{play a critical role in}} determining the way problems are solved, organizations are run, and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals. An underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society: the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems, from non-local communities to networks of exchange. Drawing theoretically from relational sociology, social network analysis avoids treating individuals (persons, organizations, states) as discrete units of analysis, it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships. In contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour, network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms. On the other hand, recent research by Omar Lizardo also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes. Social network theory is usually defined in formal mathematics and may include integration of geographical data into Sociomapping.|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: Construction {{processes}} require preparation phases where rules, {{agreements and}} arrangements for {{the execution of the}} project are discussed and determined. Detailed information is worked out where among others the construction activities are named and follow up charts are determined. In practice, follow up charts are developed that describe the project in different levels of detail. The quality of these follow up charts depends on the experiences of construction managers. The user has to specify the construction activities and their <b>interdependencies.</b> Some of these <b>interdependencies</b> are of technological nature. The technological <b>interdependencies</b> must be considered whereas other <b>interdependencies,</b> for example restrictions in the availability of resources, might be considered.
