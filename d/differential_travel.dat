It is a low-wing airplane, VW-powered, with a closed or open cockpit large enough to accommodate even very large persons, and a generous baggage compartment. A “T” tail configuration improves rudder effectiveness and prevents the stabilator from interfering with the folded wings.Wing: In order to favor takeoff and climb performance, a high aspect ratio of 8 is used, which in combination with a large diameter, slow turning prop should provide good performance even at high altitude airports. The airfoil is the NACA 633418, which has a mild stall and a good overall performance even at “standard roughness.” The 18% thickness provides a deep spar, high torsional rigidity, and makes possible the simple, compact fittings at the wing folding joint, which are band-sawed from aluminum plate. The chord is constant at 40 in., and there is no washout.The ailerons have <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> to minimize, adverse yaw. They are hinged at the bottom skin with standard piano hinges, as in the PL-1 and 2, providing smooth airflow {{over the top of the}} “down” aileron, and a good gap seal.

The backazimuth of the event is determined by rotating the N-S and E-W component records to the radial and transverse components under the guiding principle that the best angle will minimize the P-wave energy on the transverse component (Jurkevics 1988; Niu and Li 2011). The epicentral distance {{is determined by the}} <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time of S- and P-wave with manually picked direct P- and S-wave arrival time (Additional file 1 : Figure S 5).

Before calculating a <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time using cross-correlation, we applied a Butterworth-type band-pass filter to each waveform, specifying a low-frequency cutoff of 3  Hz and a high-frequency cutoff of 20  Hz, with a filter order of two for our waveforms.

40|$|The {{vigorous}} collision {{between the}} Eurasian plate and Philippine Sea plate in Taiwan causes {{a series of}} imbricate fold and thrust belts to develop at the deformation front. The Chukou Fault (CKF), characterized by a thrust type fault, located in Chiayi County, southwest (SW) Taiwan, is a prominent boundary between the fold-thrust belts and the Western Coastal Plain. Most of the seismicity in SW Taiwan is associated with this fault and its neighboring fault systems. The seismotectonic structures in the CKF zone, especially in the east, are complex due to the interactions among fault systems with distinct slip motions. To gain better insights into the seismogenic characteristics in the CKF zone, we used 1661 microearthquakes recorded by a temporary dense broadband seismic network and the Central Weather Bureau Seismic Network (CWBSN) between 2003 and 2004 to investigate the physical properties of the crust in the CKF zone. A waveform cross-correlation technique was applied to 143086 pairs of waveform data to determine the relative <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time between the P- and S-waves.

40|$|Long-wavelength {{variations}} in geoid height, bathymetry, and SS-S travel times are all relatable to lateral {{variations in}} the characteristic temperature and bulk composition of the upper mantle. The temperature and composition are in turn relatable to mantle convection {{and the degree of}} melt extraction from the upper mantle residuum. Thus the combined inversion of the geoid or gravity field, residual bathymetry, and seismic velocity information offers the promise of resolving fundamental aspects of the pattern of mantle dynamics. The use of <b>differential</b> body wave <b>travel</b> times as a measure of seismic velocity information, in particular, permits resolution of lateral variations at scales not resolvable by conventional global or regional-scale seismic tomography with long-period surface waves. These intermediate scale lengths, well resolved in global gravity field models, are crucial for understanding the details of any chemical or physical layering in the mantle and of the characteristics of so-called 'small-scale' convection beneath oceanic lithosphere. In 1991 a three-year project to the NASA Geophysics Program was proposed to carry out a systematic inversion of long-wavelength geoid anomalies, residual bathymetric anomalies, and <b>differential</b> SS-S <b>travel</b> time delays for the lateral variation in characteristic temperature and bulk composition of the oceanic upper mantle.

40|$|We present seismic {{observations}} of the uppermost layer of the inner core. This was formed most recently, thus its seismic features are related to current solidification processes. Previous studies have only constrained the east-west hemispherical seismic velocity structure in the Earth’s inner core at depths greater than 15  km below the inner core boundary. The properties of shallower structure {{have not yet been}} determined, because the seismic waves PKIKP and PKiKP used for <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time analysis arrive close together and start to interfere. Here, we present a method to make <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time measurements for waves that turn in the top 15  km of the inner core, and measure the corresponding seismic velocity anomalies. We achieve this by generating synthetic seismograms to model the overlapping signals of the inner core phase PKIKP and the inner core boundary phase PKiKP. We then use a waveform comparison to attribute different parts of the signal to each phase. By measuring the same parts of the signal in both observed and synthetic data, we are able to calculate <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time residuals. We apply our method to data with ray paths which traverse the Pacific hemisphere boundary. We generate a velocity model for this region, finding lower velocity for deeper, more easterly ray paths. Forward modelling suggests that this region contains either a high velocity upper layer, or variation in the location of the hemisphere boundary with depth and/or latitude.

40|$|Although much {{progress}} has been made in determining the three dimensional distribution of seismic wave velocities in the Earth, substantially less is known about the three dimensional distribution of intrinsic attenuation. In this study variations in attenuation and shear velocity of the Earth's mantle are constrained using measurements of <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time and attenuation. The data are broadband displacement SH seismograms filtered to have energy in the period range 8 to 20 s. Broadband data are used as they should allow a more accurate estimation of body wave attenuation to be made. The seismograms are obtained from over 600 globally distributed earthquakes of magnitude, Mw, 5. 5 or greater. Two new methods for determining <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> times and differential t* values from multiple S phases are presented. The first of these, referred to as the "waveform fitting method" is used to analyse approximately 4300 SS and S waveforms and around 1000 SSS and SS waveforms resulting in differential SS-S and SSS-SS travel times, and corresponding values of differential attenuation represented by t*. The second method, referred to as the "spectral ratio method" is used to analyse approximately 3200 SS and S and around 900 SSS and SS waveforms. The <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> times and t* values are inverted to obtain models of the lateral variation of shear velocity and lateral variation of q(mu) where q(mu) = 1 /Q(mu). The models explain the data well but have limited depth resolution. The velocity models show good correlation with previous studies, in particular, low velocities are observed underlying spreading ridges and convergent margins and high velocities are observed under continental regions. The q(mu) model shows shield regions to be less attenuating than PREM, with ridges appearing as highly attenuating features. Models of shear velocity and attenuation are also obtained by combining the body wave dataset of this study with the surface wave datasets of Van Heijst (1997) and Selby (1998). N. B.

We compute a number of global dynamic models that incorporate a phase change {{at the base of the}} mantle with different characteristics and transform the resulting temperature field and the distribution of phases to seismic velocities. Over 900 two-dimensional synthetic waveforms are computed for each of the models from which S, ScS, and Scd phases are picked. The distribution of the relative amplitudes and <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time residuals for these phases are statistically compared with the distribution of data from four well studied regions (northern Siberia, Alaska, India, and Central America) in a search for the characteristics of a phase transition that best match these seismic observations. We find that the best fit among the models considered is obtained for phase transitions characterized by a Clapeyron slope of ∼ 6 MPa K− 1 and an elevation above the core-mantle boundary of ∼ 150 km under adiabatic temperature or 127 GPa and 2650 K on a (P,T) diagram. Dynamic models demonstrate that the value of Clapeyron slope and the density difference between the phases can have significant influence on the dynamics of plumes but probably only a minor influence on the dynamics of subducted slabs. We find that the thermal structure of subducted slabs can be important in giving rise to the seismic triplication; the strongest Scd arrivals in our models are observed in the area of subduction. The folding of the slab at the base of the mantle leads to patterns in <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time distributions consistent with seismic observations and suggests that the largest heterogeneity occurs at the top of the D″ layer or just above it. Analysis of the spatial autocorrelation functions of the <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time residuals suggests that their characteristic peaks reflect the patterns of slab folding and may provide constraints on the rheology of slabs at the base of the mantle...|$|E

An appropriate shallow-layer model {{is required for the}} correction. The crust layer effect is uniform in oceans and is not very sensitive to difference in thickness as shown in Fig.  6; therefore, the global crust models such as CRUST 1.0 (Laske et al. 2013) and CRUST 2.0 (Bassin et al. 2000) are useful. Global water depths are documented, based on satellite altimetry and echo sounding by ships (e.g., ETOPO 2.0). Sediment thickness and velocity may be least documented in the shallow-layer. Although the sediment effect is negligible in mid-ocean regions, the effect is significant in regions of sediment thicker than 600  m such as back-arc basins and seas adjacent to continents. In such regions, it is important to obtain the sediment information (e.g., using an airgun) in addition to data from the global crust models.|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} achieve fast and {{selective}} protection in HVDC grids, HVDC circuit breakers and selective fault detection relays are necessary. Although HVDC circuit breakers are not commercially available yet, the development of several HVDC circuit breaker prototypes indicates that interrupting DC currents {{in the order of}} kA can be achieved in just few milliseconds [3, 4, 5]. In the literature, most research on DC protection has focused on developing fast and selective DC protection algorithms, which can be categorized into unit protection [6, 7] and non-unit protection [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Current <b>differential</b> and <b>travelling</b> wave <b>differential</b> algorithms are proposed in [6, 7], respectively, where the first travelling waves are used to distinguish the faulted cable. Non-unit protection algorithms use series inductors at the line terminals to define protection zones, and essentially identify the fault by using information contained in the first voltage/current waves. Due to the reflection by the series inductor at the cable terminal, the first voltage waves at the faulted terminals have distinctive waveforms compared to those at the healthy terminals, and can thus be used for fault discrimination. Although the input signals and discrimination methods of these protection algorithms are different, all algorithms essentially use fault initiated travelling waves to discriminate the faulted line. Therefore, in-depth understanding of the travelling wave behaviour is essential for designing robust DC protection algorithms.|$|R
40|$|Cratons {{with their}} thick lithospheric roots can {{influence}} the thermal structure, and thus the convective flow, in the surrounding mantle. As mantle temperatures are hard to measure directly, depth variations in the mantle transition zone (MTZ) discontinuities are often employed as a proxy. Here, we use a large new data set of P-receiver functions to map the 410 km and 660 km discontinuities beneath {{the western edge of}} the East European Craton and adjacent Phanerozoic Europe across the most fundamental lithospheric boundary in Europe, the Trans-European Suture Zone (TESZ). We observe significantly shorter travel times for conversions from both MTZ discontinuities within the craton, caused by the high velocities of the cratonic root. By contrast, the <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time across the MTZ is normal to only slightly raised. This implies that any insulating effect of the cratonic keel does not reach the MTZ. In contrast to earlier observations in Siberia, we do not find any trace of a discontinuity at 520 km depth, which indicates a rather dry MTZ beneath {{the western edge of the}} craton. Within most of covered Phanerozoic Europe, the MTZ <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time is remarkably uniform and in agreement with standard Earth models. No widespread thermal effects of the various episodes of Caledonian and Variscan subduction that took place during the amalgamation of the continent remain. Only more recent tectonic events, related to Alpine subduction and Quarternary volcanism in the Eifel area, can be traced. While the East European craton shows no distinct imprint into the MTZ, we discover the signature of the TESZ in the MTZ in the form of a linear region of about 350 km width with a 1. 5 s increase in <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> time, which could either be caused by high water content or decreased temperature. Taking into account results of recent S-wave tomographies, raised water content in the MTZ cannot be the main cause for this observation. Accordingly, we explain the increase, equivalent to a 15 km thicker MTZ, by a temperature decrease of about 80 K. We discuss two alternative models for this temperature reduction, either a remnant of subduction or an indication of downwelling due to small-scale, edge-driven convection caused by the contrast in lithospheric thickness across the TESZ. Any subducted lithosphere found in the MTZ at this location is unlikely to be related to Variscan subduction along the TESZ, though, as Eurasia has moved significantly northward since the Variscan orogeny...|$|E

40|$|Cell {{invasion}} {{involves a}} population of cells that migrate along a substrate and proliferate to a carrying capacity density. These two processes, combined, lead to invasion fronts that move into unoccupied tissues. Traditional modelling approaches based on reaction–diffusion equations cannot incorporate individual–level observations of cell velocity, as information propagates with infinite velocity according to these parabolic models. In contrast, velocity jump processes allow us to explicitly incorporate individual–level observations of cell velocity, thus providing an alternative framework for modelling cell invasion. Here, we introduce proliferation into a standard velocity–jump process and show that the standard model does not support invasion fronts. Instead, we find that crowding effects must be explicitly incorporated into a proliferative velocity–jump process before invasion fronts can be observed.

This article uses surveys in low and high income neighbourhoods in Manila, the Philippines, to assess the social equity implications of differential access to transport. The analysis demonstrates how the theoretical framework of the Capability Approach (Nussbaum, 2003; Sen, 1985, 1999, 2009) can be used to assess what individuals might be able to access (capabilities) versus their actual travel (functionings). The spatial patterns of travel and access to activities are assessed, demonstrating significant differences by gender, age, income and neighbourhood, in terms of travel mode and cost of travel; health, physical and mental integrity; senses, imagination and thoughts; reasoning and planning; social interaction; natural environment; sustainable modes; and information. This approach to assessing the transport dimensions of social equity offers much potential, based not only on access to resources or consumption of mobility, but also in the opportunities that people have in relation to their activity participation.

All differential times are corrected for contributions from aspherical mantle structure above D′ ′ using a high-resolution tomography model. Travel time analyses demonstrate the presence of pervasive high velocities in D′′, with the highest velocities localized to a region beneath Central America, approximately 500 – 700 km in lateral dimension. Short wavelength variability overprints this general high-velocity background. Corrections are also made for lithospheric anisotropy beneath the receivers. Shear wave splitting analyses of the corrected waveforms reveal D′ ′ anisotropy throughout the study area...|$|E

The <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> times of the PKP waves (which traverse Earth's core) correlate remarkably well with predictions for S-wave tomography. Our modeling suggests a sharp transition in the lowermost mantle from a broad slow region to a broad fast region with a narrow zone of slowest anomaly next to the boundary beneath the Cocos Plate and the Caribbean Plate. The structure {{may be the result}} of ponding of ancient subducted Farallon slabs situated near the edge of a thermal and chemical upwelling...|$|E
40|$|A central step in time-distance local {{helioseismology}} techniques is {{to obtain}} travel times of packets of wave signals between points or sets of {{points on the}} visible surface. Standard ways of determining group or phase travel times involve cross-correlating the signal between locations at the solar photosphere and determining the shift of the envelope of this cross correlation function, or a zero crossing, using a standard wavelet or a reference wave packet. Here a novel method is described which makes use of triple correlations, i. e. cross-correlating signal between three locations. By using an average triple correlation as reference, <b>differential</b> <b>travel</b> times can be extracted in a straightforward manner.

40|$|Abstract. Usin the Painlev test, it {{is shown}} that the only interablc {{nonlinear}} Klein-Gordon equations ux,=f(u) with f a linear combination of exponentials are the Liouville, sine-Gordon (or sinh-Gordon) and Mikhailov equations. In particular, the double sine-Gordon equation is not interable. Key words, completely integrable, Painlev 6 property, Klein-Gordon equation AMS(MOS) subject classifications. Primary 35 Q 20, 34 A 20 In [7], two of the present authors (J. B. M. and P. J. O.) considered the problem of which nonlinear Klein-Gordon equations (1) u:,t=f(u) are completely integrable. They referred to the Ablowitz-Ramani-Segur (ARS) conjecture, [2], [3] which states that if a partial differential equation is integrable by the inverse scattering transform (IST) method, then all its reductions to ordinary differential equations have the Painlev 6 property, i. e., all their moveable singularities are poles. It was shown in [7] that if f(u) is a linear combination of exponentials, the only equations of type (1) whose corresponding ordinary <b>differential</b> equation for <b>travelling</b> wave solution...|$|R
40|$|Travelling wave {{phenomena}} {{are observed}} in many biological applications. Mathematical theory of standard reaction-diffusion problems shows that simple partial <b>differential</b> equations exhibit <b>travelling</b> wave solutions with constant wavespeed and such models {{are used to}} describe, for example, waves of chemical concentrations, electrical signals, cell migration, waves of epidemics and population dynamics. However, as {{in the study of}} cell motion in complex spatial geometries, experimental data are often not consistent with constant wavespeed. Non-local spatial models have successfully been used to model anomalous diffusion and spatial heterogeneity in different physical contexts. In this paper, we develop a fractional model based on the Fisher-Kolmogoroff equation and analyse it for its wavespeed properties, attempting to relate the numerical results obtained from our simulations to experimental data describing enteric neural crest-derived cells migrating along the intact gut of mouse embryos. The model proposed essentially combines fractional and standard diffusion in different regions of the spatial domain and qualitatively reproduces the behaviour of neural crest-derived cells observed in the caecum and the hindgut of mouse embryos during in vivo experiments...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{asymptotic}} {{shape of the}} solution u(t; x) 2 [0; 1] to a one-dimensional heat equation with a multiplicative white noise term. At time zero the solution is an interface, that is u(0; x) is 0 for all large positive x and u(0; x) is 1 for all large negative x. The special form of the noise term preserves this property at all times t 0. The main result is that, {{in contrast to the}} deterministic heat equation, the width of the interface remains stochastically bounded. 1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.
