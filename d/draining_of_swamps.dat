Additional threats include loss of genetic variability, disturbance, hunting, and collection of eggs and chicks for food or pets.|$|E
50|$|Swamp {{paperbark}} {{occurs in}} near-coastal areas of New South Wales south of Port Macquarie to Port Philip Bay in Victoria. It {{is also found}} on the islands of Bass Strait and is common near the coast in the north, north east and west of Tasmania. It grows beside streams and in coastal swamps in heath and dry sclerophyll forest. <b>Draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>swamps</b> and land clearance have significantly reduced the numbers of this species in Victoria.|$|E
50|$|Progress in {{developing}} the land around Cranbourne was hampered by the Koo Wee Rup swampland. However William Lyall (who bought land in the swamp area) assisted in coordinating the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> the <b>swamp</b> to make it usable as farmland.|$|R

50|$|The monastery was {{established}} by 44 monks from Aiguebelle Abbey in 1863, on the invitation of Mgr Pierre-Henri Gérault de Langalerie, bishop of Belley, with the aim not only of evangelizing the country, but also <b>of</b> <b>draining</b> the <b>swamps</b> <b>of</b> the Dombes, so as to improve agriculture and fishing and raise {{the standard of living}} of the inhabitants.|$|R
50|$|The {{development}} of the site, by now known as Queens' Park began with modest efforts - in 1873 the Council was granted £200 for the {{development of}} Queens Park this was used for the construction of timber rail fencing. Fencing was a significant stage in the {{development of the}} park because it prohibited itinerant and destructive cattle and also allowed regulation of hours of opening. The Council was also concerned with the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>swamps</b> throughout Toowoomba including swampy land on the western side of Queens Park.|$|E
50|$|American {{physician}} and humanitarian Doctor John Gorrie built a refrigerator in 1844 {{with the purpose}} of cooling air. His refrigerator produced ice which he hung from the ceiling in a basin. Gorrie can be considered the creator of ice cubes, but his aim was not to cool drinks: he used the ice to lower the ambient room temperature. During his time, a dominant idea was that bad air quality caused disease. Therefore, in order to help treat sickness, he pushed for the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>swamps</b> and the cooling of sickrooms.|$|E

50|$|This {{species is}} {{threatened}} due to habitat destruction. It {{is thought to}} have nested in canebrakes, the loss of which posed a threat, as did loss of wintering habitat in the Caribbean and plume hunting. Small-scale logging in the 1800s may actually have increased Bachman warbler's breeding habitat. Clearcutting of its habitat and the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>swamps</b> via water channels are the two main causes of habitat destruction. While it is unknown whether habitat change in its wintering grounds of Cuba affected the species, it is believed that a winter hurricane in the 1930s could have been a crippling blow, making them too rare to find each other and mate.|$|E

5000|$|The {{species is}} endemic to Thailand, and was {{described}} by Hugh M. Smith in 1931 as being 'not uncommon' in Bueng Boraphet and the streams which lead from it, and as being found in the Chao Phraya River {{as far south as}} Bangkok. A 1934 expedition reported catching a specimen in the Silom canal. As of 2011 it is only known at a single location in the Chao Phraya basin, and has Critically Endangered status on the IUCN Red List. [...] From 1996 until 2011 it was believed to be Extinct in the Wild. There is no evidence that collection for the aquarium trade is responsible for the species' decline, and {{it is more likely that}} construction of dams and <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>swamps</b> that took place during the 1970s was to blame.|$|E

2500|$|By late 1881, Te Puke boasted 25 wooden {{buildings}} {{including two}} hotels, two general stores, a butcher, {{a post office}} and a smithy. The settlers quickly settled upon the land and by 1884 had established a butter factory. <b>Draining</b> <b>of</b> the <b>swamps</b> began and the area {{was found to be}} very suitable for crops, and maize and wheat were grown extensively.

5000|$|Prior to European settlement, {{the area}} was home to the Bunurong and Wurundjeri {{indigenous}} peoples.

However, by 1840, reduction of their hunting grounds, <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> the <b>swamps</b> and introduction <b>of</b> European diseases such as smallpox and measles effectively ended their ability to maintain a traditional lifestyle.|$|R
5000|$|The most {{critical}} threat facing threatened birds is the destruction and fragmentation of habitat. The loss of forests, plains {{and other natural}} systems into agriculture, mines, and urban developments, the <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>swamps</b> and other wetlands, and logging reduce potential habitat for many species. In addition the remaining patches of habitat are often too small or fragmented by the construction of roads or other such barriers that cause populations in these fragmented islands to become vulnerable to localised extinction. In addition many forest species show limited abilities to disperse and occupy new forest fragments (see Island biogeography). The loss of tropical rainforest is the most pressing problem, as these forests hold {{the highest number of}} species yet are being destroyed quickly. Habitat loss has been implicated in a number of extinctions, including the ivory-billed woodpecker (disputed because of [...] "rediscovery"), Bachman's warbler and the dusky seaside sparrow.|$|E
50|$|The Turks {{were also}} {{encouraged}} to emigrate from Bulgaria by regulations which affected {{the cultivation of}} rice - which was originally introduced to the region by the Turks. This {{was part of a}} project to eradicate malaria that included also <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>swamps</b> in the Tundzha, Arda, and Maritsa Basins. The project succeeded in eradicating malaria, however, it also exacerbated droughts in those regions. Rice was a staple crop for the Turks and in its prohibition many of them saw yet another sign of unacceptable Bulgarian domination. An even more important impulse to Turkish emigration was the Bulgarian land tax of 1882. By Moslem law all land was owned by God but after the abolition of feudalism in the 1830s use of that land conferred temporary wardship upon the user, and thus the tithe which had been the main levy on land until 1882 conformed to traditional Moslem codes of thought and practice. The land tax did not. Furthermore, land tax applied to all land in a man's possession not, as under the tithe, merely to that part which had been cultivated. This hit the Turks hard for they customarily left a large proportion, in many cases as much as half, of their land fallow. Taxation now fell on the fallow land too but production and earnings could not be increased by the same proportion and as a result many of the remaining Turkish owners of large estates left Rumelia. Significantly 1882 was the peak year for the sale of larger Turkish properties in Rumelia, though the sale of such properties continued steadily throughout {{the first half of the}} 1880s. From the end of the war to the summer of 1880 only six large Turkish chifliks in Eastern Rumelia had been sold but the five years before union with the Principality of Bulgaria in 1885 saw the sale of about a hundred. That most of the larger Turkish owners and many smaller ones left Rumelia was undoubtedly an important factor in the easy attainment of Bulgarian supremacy in Rumelia during the early 1880s.|$|E
40|$|After de Selys Longchamps (1842), the otter in Belgium was a {{widespread}} species along all the full of fish rivers and {{was regarded as}} a pest namely in the fishponds of the Campine. This animal becomes extremely rare now: in Wallony, we only recorded one place where cubs are reared every year. The main reasons for this steep population decrease are well known: i. the otter has been systematically destroyed by hunters, fishermen and trappers who were receiving bounties till 1965 ! ii. the water pollution and the radical changes of the rivers physical characteristics (dredging, straightening and reshaping the river beds or banks) have had disastrous effects on fish, the main food resource of the otter. iii. a lot of previous suitable habitats have been destroyed due to for example <b>draining</b> <b>of</b> <b>swamps</b> and marshes and concreting the river banks. A comprehensive study of the fish populations in Wallony reveals that a small number of streams are still inhabited by relatively undamaged fish communities. Most freshwaters are polluted at different levels, some in a chronic way, others irregularly and many of them have been damaged by hydraulic works so becoming unsuitable for the otters because of a drastic reduction of their fish biomass. In such circumstances it seems likely that we cannot be really optimistic as far as the otter's future in our country is concerned. The last places where otters can still be found today must be inconditionnally protected against every disturbance of whatever type; but those measures will only help if a strong program is undertaken without delay intending to improve the water quality. An educational campaign is also urgently needed...|$|E
