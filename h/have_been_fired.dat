The girls hit upon the idea of singing at the concerts and set about promoting the next concert. The following Sunday Edna and Judy join Granddad on the bandstand. Edna's operatic style and Judy's swing bring crowds running {{from all over the}} park. The event is a huge success and Granddad's concerts are saved.|$|E

5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft. The softness of the brick has {{caused it to}} weather in a non-uniform fashion. The brick is said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> at a small brickyard which once existed on the Kishwaukee River in DeKalb, near the present-day Lincoln Highway bridge. The home stands on a stone foundation and was designed by local carpenter and eventual barbed wire competitor to Glidden, Jacob Haish. Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E
5|$|Between 17:48 and 17:52, 11 German dreadnoughts, {{including}} Rheinland, {{engaged and}} opened fire on the British 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, though the range and poor visibility prevented effective fire, which was soon checked. Some ten minutes later Rheinland again opened fire on the British cruisers, targeting what was most likely , though without success. By 20:15, the German fleet had faced the deployed Grand Fleet {{for a second time}} and was forced to turn away; in doing so, the order of the German line was reversed, with Rheinland third from the front, behind Westfalen and Nassau. At 21:22, crewmen aboard Rheinland and Westfalen, the two leading ships in the German line, spotted two torpedo tracks {{that turned out to be}} imaginary. The ships were then forced to slow down in order to allow the battlecruisers of the I Scouting Group to pass ahead. Around 22:00, Rheinland and Westfalen observed unidentified light forces in the gathering darkness. After flashing a challenge via searchlight that was ignored, the two ships turned away to starboard in order to evade any torpedoes that might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired.</b> The rest of I Battle Squadron followed them.|$|E
5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he has done in the past two days. Scully finds that two bullets <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E

5|$|On 19 June, {{the first}} part of the long-awaited French {{contingent}} (in total some 6,000 soldiers and 31 ships), under the command of François, Duke of Beaufort, arrived at Candia. The second part, comprising the galley fleet, would arrive on 3 July. The Ottomans had been making steady progress over the past years, having reached the outer bastions of the fortress; the defenders were in dire straits, while most of the city of Candia lay ruined. The French staged their first sally on 25 June. Caught by surprise, the Ottomans were quickly routed, but the French became disorganized among the siege trenches, and an Ottoman counter-attack drove them back. The attack thus ended in disaster, costing the French some 800 dead, including the Duke of Beaufort himself, who was hit by a bullet and left on the field. The arrival of the second half of the French expeditionary force revived the defenders' morale, and a combined attack was agreed upon, involving bombardment of the Ottoman siege lines by the powerful allied fleet. The attack was launched on 25 July, in an impressive display of firepower: up to 15,000 cannonballs were said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> by the fleet alone. The Ottomans however were well-protected by their deep earthworks, and suffered comparatively little damage, while things went awry for the Christian fleet, as an accident caused the explosion of the French ship Thérèse, which in turn caused significant casualties among the surrounding French and Venetian ships.|$|E
5|$|Yang expresses {{difficulty}} {{connecting with}} the children on pediatrics, to Robbins' disappointment. Tom becomes frightened when he notices Lexie is not wearing a name tag, so she attacks her and runs away. His mother is subsequently diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm, for which requires surgery, and Tom falls down the stairs, for which also requires surgery. Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez) returns to the hospital, and informs Robbins that Yang is just sucking up. The Crawley's are uneasy about agreeing to surgery, but Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) convinces them {{that it is the}} right thing to do. An obstetrics and gynecology resident accidentally cuts off a baby's arm during a caesarian section, but it is healed by plastic surgeon Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Robbins, and Yang. Stevens assists Shepherd with a five-hour craniotomy, and Karev is fearful that she cannot handle it, although she is ultimately able to complete the surgery. At the conclusion of the episode, human resources sends out an email notifying Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback) and Dr. Steve Mostow (Mark Saul)'s wife Megan (Molly Kidder), that they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} season, Parrish, {{who appears to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> from the FBI, is working a desk job as {{an analyst at the}} CIA while living with Shelby and {{continuing}} her relationship with Ryan, who later becomes her fiancé. Flashbacks reveal that she is working undercover for the FBI as a CIA recruit. She is tasked with uncovering a rogue faction of the CIA called the AIC. At The Farm, she is joined with other recruits, including Harry Doyle (Russell Tovey), Dayana Mampasi (Pearl Thusi), Sebastian Chen (David Lim), León Velez (Aarón Díaz), Leigh Davis (Heléne Yorke), and Jeremy Miller (David Call). Ryan later joins the other recruits at the site, much to Alex's surprise. Some time after her recruitment, Alex has a meeting with Matthew Keyes and Miranda Shaw. It is revealed that she was recruited by the CIA as part of a covert mission to establish any potential threats within the agency. Ryan is also recruited by the agency for the same mission. Owen Hall (Blair Underwood) is confirmed to be the primary CIA instructor for the training site at TheFarm. In addition, Lydia Hall (Tracy Ifeachor) is later revealed to be another trainer on-site. Alex and the other recruits undergo a series of training assessments in order to become future case officers. After being kicked out of TheFarm by Lydia, Alex goes back to working as an analyst. In addition, she breaks off her engagement with Ryan some time before the 2018 G-20 hostage crisis in New York.|$|E

500|$|Churchill {{was able}} to prove, by firing a {{different}} gun of the same design, that the bullet that killed the police officer <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> from a revolver of the same make and calibre as the gun reported to be Williams'. However, the prosecution needed proof that the bullet <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> from that particular revolver. At the suggestion of Chief Inspecter Bower, photographers attempted to photograph {{the inside of the}} gun barrel in order to prove that the bullet <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> from that particular revolver; the attempts were unsuccessful, and Churchill instead made a cast of the inside of the gun from dental wax.

25|$|In January 2004, {{prosecutors}} in the trial against Stanislav Galić, a Bosnian Serb general, Sarajevo-Romanija Corps commander in the siege of Sarajevo, introduced into evidence a report including the testimony of ammunition expert Berko Zečević. Working with two colleagues, Zečević's investigation revealed {{a total of six}} possible locations from which the shell in the first Markale massacre could <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired,</b> of which five were under VRS and one under ARBiH control. The ARBiH site in question was visible to UNPROFOR observers at the time, who reported that no shell was fired from that position. Zečević further reported that certain components of the projectile could only <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>fired</b> from one of two places, both of which were {{under the control of the}} Army of Republika Srpska. The court would eventually find Galić guilty beyond reasonable doubt of all five shellings prosecutors had charged him with, including Markale. Although widely reported by the international media, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights noted that the verdict was ignored in Serbia itself.|$|E
