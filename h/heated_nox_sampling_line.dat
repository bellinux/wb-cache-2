40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Two <b>sampling</b> <b>lines</b> were {{established}} in the intertidal region at each of three geographically separate sites {{on the coast of}} Oregon. Each <b>sampling</b> <b>line,</b> which was positioned in the zone dominated by the brown alga Hedophyllum sessile, was one meter in height and extended 50 meters horizontally. Information was sought concerning primarily the possible biological dependence of one species on another or the biological exclusion of one species by another.

Considering the factors of observed occurrences and co-occurrences, as well as calculated coefficient of association values, biological dependency was suggested for the algal pairs Ulva expansa - Ralfsia pacifica and Gigartina papillata - Endocladia muricata. The <b>sampling</b> <b>lines</b> at only one of the three sites differed greatly in the probability of chance distribution of species. However, large differences were noted among each of the sites.

For each view, these <b>line</b> <b>samples</b> are originated from the vanishing point of lines {{perpendicular to the}} ground plane. With these <b>line</b> <b>samples,</b> vertical <b>line</b> <b>samples</b> in the 3 -D scene can be reconstructed for potential human locations. After some efficient geometric refinement and filtering procedures, the remaining qualified 3 -D <b>line</b> <b>samples</b> are clustered and integrated for the identification of locations and heights {{of people in the}} scene. Both indoor and outdoor scenarios are examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in handling serious occlusion in crowed scenes. The average localization error of less than 15 cm for average viewing distance of 15 m suggests that our method can be applied to a broad range of surveillance applications that require the real-time computation of localization without using special hardware for acceleration.

40|$|The HALO Submicrometer Aerosol Inlet (HASI) was {{specifically}} designed for HALO with the aim to provide up to 30 l/min sample air flow (divided over four forward facing <b>sample</b> <b>lines)</b> to aerosol instruments mounted inside the aircraft cabin. HASI samples the air {{on the top of}} the fuselage outside of the aircraft boundary layer. The air stream is aligned in the inlet and deaccelerated in three stages by roughly a factor of 40 using a front shroud, a main diffusor and smaller diffusers at the tips of four sample tubes which protrude into the deaccelerated air stream. In addition, there is a backward-facing sample tube installed for optional use. The design concept is to allow regulating the sample air flow in each of the four forward-facing <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> to achieve isokinetic sampling conditions according to the actual speed of the aircraft. Pumps and bypass lines for regulation of the air flow are part of the Aerosol Measurement System (AMETYST) cabin rack on HALO operated by DLR. The geometric design of the inlet should prevent large cloud droplets and ice crystals from entering the <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> directly. Judging from the first measurements of different instruments using HASI during the ML-CIRRUS and ACRIDICON-CHUVA missions with HALO, it appears that condensation particle counter (CPC) measurements of interstitial aerosol in liquid clouds are affected by artefacts while in ice clouds there is no indication of any measurement problem. Selected examples of other measurement results for initial experimental characterization of the inlet will be discussed. In order to achieve better isokinetic sampling, further numerical flow simulations of the final inlet design for different aircraft altitudes and speeds are required to establish a final regulation of the sample air flow in each of the four <b>sample</b> <b>lines</b> based on pressure and temperature sensors in the inlet and aircraft data...|$|R

The gentle slope between 1 and 20  μL described the reagent line overlapping with the <b>sample</b> <b>line,</b> and the rising peak here was due to decreasing sample dispersion. Towards 50  μL, there was a sharp descent to zero because the sample was overlapped by a carrier water line and reagent was totally absent at this end. In further analyses, 35  μL was the volume adopted for dispensing to the flowcell.|$|R
