40|$|In this thesis, the {{development}} of a novel experimental technique for measuring the spontaneous, stochastic work function (WF) fluctuations of conducting polymer films, at equilibrium, is discussed. Polyaniline (PANI) is studied as a representative conducting polymer. This technique utilizes an <b>insulated-gate</b> <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistor</b> (IGFET) with PANI gate electrode (PANI-IGFET). The fluctuations of PANI WF are transduced into measurable drain current fluctuations of the device. By analyzing these fluctuations while systematically controlling the temperature, electric field and doping level, a model of WF fluctuations in PANI films is developed. These experiments suggest that the source of WF fluctuations is the hopping of charge carriers, or trapping/detrapping of charge carriers, around the Fermi level of the PANI film at the PANI-insulator interface. This process is thermally activated with a field and doping dependent activation energy in the range of 0. 1 to 0. 5 eV. Thus, this new technique provides detailed information about charge-carrier dynamics in the space-charge region of the PANI film, at equilibrium. These results have important implications for organic electronics and furthering fundamental understanding of the relationship between doping, disorder and work function in organic semiconductors.

40|$|We have {{systematically}} investigated {{effects of}} plasma processing, formation of Si-based dielectrics, and {{formation of a}} thin Al 2 O 3 film on the chemical and electronic properties of GaN and GaN/AlGaN heterostructure surfaces. The surface treatment in H 2 -plasma excited by electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) source, produced nitrogen-vacancy-related defect levels at GaN and AlGaN surfaces, while the ECR-N 2 -plasma treatment improved electronic properties of the surfaces. The deposition of a SiO 2 film on GaN and AlGaN surfaces was found to induce high-density interface states, due to unexpected and uncontrollable oxidation reactions on the surfaces during the deposition process. In comparison, the SiNx/GaN passivation structure prepared by ECR-plasma assisted chemical vapor deposition showed good interface properties with the minimum Dit value of 1 × 1011 cm– 2 eV– 1. However, excess leakage currents governed by Fowler–Nordheim tunneling were observed in the SiNx/Al 0. 3 Ga 0. 7 N structure, due to a relatively small conduction band offset of 0. 7 eV between SiNx and Al 0. 3 Ga 0. 7 N. A novel Al 2 O 3 -based passivation structure was proposed and fabricated by molecular beam deposition of Al and subsequent ECR O 2 -plasma oxidation. In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy showed successful formation of the Al 2 O 3 layer with a thickness of 3. 5 nm and a large conduction band offset of 2. 1 eV between Al 2 O 3 and A 0. 3 Ga 0. 7 N. The GaN/AlGaN <b>insulated-gate</b> heterostructure <b>field-effect</b> <b>transistors</b> (IG HFETs) having the Al 2 O 3 -based passivation structure showed a good gate control of drain currents up to VGS = + 3 V and achieved drain saturation current of 0. 8 A/mm.
