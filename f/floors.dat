5|$|On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire {{broke out}} on the 11th floor of the North Tower. The fire spread through {{the core of the}} {{building}} to the 9th and 14th <b>floors,</b> as the insulation for telephone cables, located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between <b>floors,</b> had been ignited. Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. Fireproofing protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th <b>floors,</b> water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few <b>floors</b> below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had no fire sprinkler systems.|$|E

40|$|<b>Floor</b> {{failure in}} coal mines {{has not been}} studied {{to the same extent}} as roof failure despite causing {{significant}} delays in production. Understanding <b>floor</b> failure mechanisms when mining tabular deposits is, therefore, extremely important. This thesis reviews current understanding of stone <b>floor</b> failure and also explains several other <b>floor</b> failure mechanisms that can occur at the longwall face. Key objective {{of this study is to}} provide geotechnical engineers with comprehensive guidelines for predicting <b>floor</b> failure, and outline possible solutions to this problem. Most commonly encountered <b>floor</b> problems are associated with <b>floor</b> heave and <b>floor</b> puncturing below the hydraulic supports. Although, there are many variables that can contribute to these problems, identifying the causes is often complex and requires a considerable understanding of failure mechanisms. In this research study, two major <b>floor</b> failure mechanisms were identified, primary <b>floor</b> failure and secondary <b>floor</b> failure. Primary <b>floor</b> failure occurs in response to the triaxial stress state ahead of the coal face, where stresses high. Secondary <b>floor</b> failure can be attributed to post failure distribution of stress and subsequent <b>floor</b> displacements. Five mechanisms of secondary <b>floor</b> failure were identified. Typically, these failures cause <b>floor</b> heave that may interfere with the longwall operations or affect stability of the powered supports. The puncture of weak stone <b>floor</b> that often occurs when load is applied onto the weak <b>floor</b> below the powered supports is the only failure mode that has been well understood for some time. This failure which has been researched in both soil mechanics and rock mechanics, resembles a foundation bearing capacity type of failure mechanism. Buckling of bedded <b>floor</b> strata that often occurs between the longwall face and the bases of the powered supports is associated with excessive yielding of the seam deposit. Failed seam moves towards excavated goaf, and if coupled with the stone <b>floor,</b> can shear the <b>floor</b> bedding planes and buckle upper <b>floor</b> strata. <b>Floor</b> failure induced by multiple blocks sliding within the <b>floor</b> can occur when weak bedding planes shear l- 3 m below <b>floor</b> level and the sub-vertical fractures split the <b>floor</b> at regular intervals. The <b>floor</b> blocks interact at the corners and can induce large lateral stress at the <b>floor</b> level. If stress exceeds <b>floor</b> strength, shear failure <b>floor</b> level can be expected, manifesting itself as <b>floor</b> heave, which may interfere with mining operations. Stress concentrations at the longwall corners depend on the magnitude and direction of the pre-mining stress. At these corners, stone <b>floor</b> buckling is often experienced. Weak bedding planes within the <b>floor</b> can exacerbate this type of <b>floor</b> failure. Large goaf areas redistribute vertical stress that concentrates adjacent to goaf excavations. When the chain pillars that support the roof in the goaf are too small, their failure will transfer the vertical stress forward towards the longwall face where increased vertical load interacts with the <b>floor,</b> inducing complex <b>floor</b> failure. A <b>floor</b> monitoring program was undertaken to investigate fracture formation and <b>floor</b> movement at the longwall face. The monitoring program indicated formation of near vertical fractures in the <b>floor</b> as well as bedding planes shearing well ahead of the face. These primary fractures were measured ahead of the face and provide the basis for the secondary <b>floor</b> failure mechanisms described in this thesis. Understanding fracture formation and their behaviour is very important in developing an analytical theory of <b>floor</b> failure. Analytical solutions were derived to calculate probable <b>floor</b> failure occurrence, which were then compared with modem numerical modelling to predict possible <b>floor</b> failure under a variety of conditions expected to occur sedimentary strata. Each of the described <b>floor</b> failure mechanisms is investigated in detail using an analytical and numerical approach. Towards the end of the thesis, a risk assessment procedure has been prepared with the <b>floor</b> failure mechanisms included, for the practising engineer to follow when investigating the possibility of <b>floor</b> failure in an underground mine...|$|R
