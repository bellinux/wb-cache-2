5|$|Between May 1917 and May 1918, Mackinnon {{worked at}} the University War Hospital in Southamptom with William Fletcher from the Royal Army Medical Corps, {{focussing}} on the {{diagnosis and treatment of}} dysentery. The pair focussed on two forms of Shigella dysenteriae which had been identified by Simon Flexner and Kiyoshi Shiga. They discovered that the Flexner bacillus could go into intermission and be undetectable for periods of four to five weeks, making it very difficult to say when someone was no longer a carrier. They also found that men who were carriers of Shiga's bacillus would be prone to depression and would be no longer <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Louis then targets Henry D'Ascoyne, a keen amateur photographer. He meets Henry and is {{charmed by}} his wife, Edith. He {{substitutes}} petrol for paraffin in the lamp of Henry's darkroom, with fatal results. Louis decides the widow is <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> his duchess. The Reverend Lord Henry D'Ascoyne {{is the next}} victim. Posing as the Anglican Bishop of Matabeleland, Louis poisons his port. From {{the window of his}} flat, Louis then uses a bow to shoot down the balloon from which the suffragette Lady Agatha D'Ascoyne is dropping leaflets over London. Louis next sends General Lord Rufus D'Ascoyne a jar of caviar which contains a bomb. Admiral Lord Horatio D'Ascoyne presents a challenge, as he rarely sets foot on land. However, he insists on going down with his ship after causing a collision at sea.|$|E

The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork {{at the top of the}} tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reused. The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.|$|E
5|$|Wasteland Angel {{was first}} {{announced}} on May 17, 2011, with a prospective release date for summer {{of the same}} year. The game was developed by Octane Games, an independent development team in Kotka, Finland that is owned by Nitro Games. The company was founded in Spring 2011, shortly after Nitro Games completed the arcade shooter Woody Two-Legs. Wasteland Angel would be their first release under the Octane Games brand. Before the release, the group had already announced the second game they were working on: a pirate role-playing game titled Raven's Cry. Although Wasteland Angel is published by Meridian4, Raven's Cry was signed {{to be published by}} TopWare Interactive. In the announcement for Wasteland Angel, the publisher noted plans to make additional downloadable content available for the game after it was launched. In an August 2011 interview, Octane Games CEO Jussi Tähtinen stated that the company was focusing on multiplatform development and that Wasteland Angel seemed in ideal <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> marketed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but he declined to share any specific plans to bring the game to either platform. When asked {{about the possibility of a}} multiplayer mode, Tähtinen again declined to make any announcement.|$|E

He had been found fit for home duties but the British Government had granted permission for ordinands to continue their training. Therefore, he was able to continue his studies without serving in the military. In 1941, he entered Cuddesdon College, an Anglican theological college, to train for the priesthood. He undertook two years of formation before being ordained in 1943.|$|E

30|$|Here, l is the {{distance}} between the edge of light spot and the connection of the two contacts, Ls is the diffusion length of electrons, and A is a constant. Using Eqs. (2) and (4) <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> the experimentally measured PISHE current, we can obtain the spin transverse force f 0 and the diffusion length A·Ls. The fitting result is shown in Fig.  1 c by a solid line. One can see that the experimental data is well-fitted by the model. In the fitting, the following experimentally measured parameters are adopted, σ = 0.2 mm, L = 4 mm, r 0 = 0.7 mm, and Rab = 15.5 k Ω. The spin transverse force f 0 /q of electrons <b>is</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 6.8 × 10 − 6 N ·m/C at 300 K, A·Ls <b>is</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 2.8 × 10 − 4 m, and the radius of the absorption saturated area <b>is</b> <b>fitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 0.34 mm, which indicates that the absorption saturated intensity of the light Ic corresponds to about one fifth of the maximum intensity Im, i.e., Ic = 1 / 5 Im.|$|R

25|$|Natural gas {{processing}} changes the commodity in two critical ways. First, it extracts valuable by-products; second, it renders natural gas <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transported {{to a point}} for commercial sale and consumption. Through the use of evolving technology, the {{gas processing}} industry of each era extracts higher percentages of {{a wider range of}} hydrocarbons and other commercial by-products than its predecessors. It also removes ever-higher percentages of dangerous and other unwanted impurities. Steady growth has made natural gas a major industry, with 180 cubic kilometres of gas flowing from Canadian fields to market, every year.|$|E
25|$|In 1929 the English Folk Dance Society {{held its}} Easter Vacation School on the Isle of Man.

However, Douglas was able to pull {{together}} various notes on Manx dance into a form <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> presented to the Society. Through the assistance of teachers and pupils at Albert Road School in Ramsey, Douglas was able to have three of these reconstructed dances performed: 'The Manx Dirk Dance', 'Hyndaa yn Bwoailley' and 'Eunyssagh Vona'.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} opinion, {{written by}} Justice Byron White, {{reasoned that the}} Constitution did not confer “a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy”. A concurring opinion by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger cited the “ancient roots” of prohibitions against homosexual sex, quoting William Blackstone’s description of homosexual sex as an “infamous crime against nature”, worse than rape, and “a crime not <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> named”. Burger concluded: “To hold {{that the act of}} homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.” Justice Lewis F. Powell later said he regretted joining the majority, but thought the case of little importance at the time.|$|E

25|$|The two {{movements}} {{may have}} been added after Bach's death to make the cantata <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> performed on Easter Sunday. Picander did not refer to the specific readings for the Third Day of Easter in his text. According to Klaus Hofmann, Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach expanded the cantata by the two additional movements in Hamburg (after 1768) and set the first movement himself. In 1787 Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach published the music of that movement as composed by his father (No.337 in the Breitkopf edition of J.S. Bach's four-part chorales). According to Günther Zedler this sufficiently confirms that the movement was composed by the father. According to Christoph Wolff, the cantata {{may have been}} compiled by Carl Friedrich Zelter for the Sing-Akademie zu Berlin.|$|E
25|$|Tsar Alexander III of Russia {{and then}} Tsar Nicholas II, his son, had revived with utmost {{brutality}} the anti-Jewish pogroms, which created the spontaneous mass exodus to America. The pogroms were to continue until 1906, {{with thousands of}} other Jewish families also needing to escape, including those of George and Ira Gershwin, Al Jolson, Sophie Tucker, L. Wolfe Gilbert, Jack Yellen, Louis B. Mayer (of MGM), and the Warner brothers. It has been suspected that the Beilin family also fled due to these progroms, {{though there is no}} evidence to indicate that there were progroms in Tolochin or Tyumen when the Beilins left for America. When they reached Ellis Island, Israel was put in a pen with his brother and five sisters until immigration officials declared them <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allowed into the city.|$|E
25|$|In later years, Greg Chappell {{admitted}} that he had been exhausted and stressed after a demanding season of cricket and that, in hindsight, he was not mentally <b>fit</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> captain at the time. He had also been on the field through the majority of the match that had been played in stifling hot conditions. At the 40 over mark of the New Zealand innings, Chappell (who had scored 90 in the Australian innings and then bowled 10 overs to the New Zealanders) told wicketkeeper Rod Marsh that he wanted to leave the field. Marsh, who described Chappell as being physically spent and exhausted, said that wasn't possible and that Chappell {{had no choice but to}} see out the match. Despite being captain and arranging bowling changes and field placings, Chappell spent several overs fielding on the boundary because he felt overwhelmed by the conditions and the pressure of the situation.|$|E
