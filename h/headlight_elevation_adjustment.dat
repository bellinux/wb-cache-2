50|$|Maximum {{effective}} range is given as 800 m, but record shots {{have been made}} with the M24 at over 1000 m. Meanwhile, the standard optical sight has a maximum <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> of 1000 m.|$|R
5000|$|Older {{telescopic}} sights {{often did}} not offer windage and <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments</b> in the scope, but rather used adjustable mounts to provide adjustment. Some modern mounts also allow for adjustment, but it is generally intended to supplement the scope adjustments. For example, some situations require fairly extreme <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments,</b> such as very short range shooting common with airguns, or very long range shooting, where the bullet drop becomes very significant. Also, loose manufacturing tolerances may result in base mounting holes being less than perfectly aligned with the bore. In this case, rather than adjusting the scope to the extremes of its <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment,</b> the scope mount can be adjusted. This allows the scope to operate {{near the center of}} its adjustment range, which puts less stress on the internals. Some companies offer adjustable bases, while others offer tapered bases with a given amount of elevation built in (commonly listed in MOA). The adjustable bases are more flexible, but the fixed bases are far more durable, as adjustable bases may loosen and shift under recoil. [...] Also, adjustable bases are considerably more expensive, as well.|$|R

50|$|Essentially a new design, {{influenced}} by German 50mm mortars, which was continued in use until 50mm mortars {{were removed from}} Soviet Army service. This mortar was without a tripod but instead relied on its barrel yoke which contained traverse and <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments.</b> The gases now vented under the muzzle via a tube.|$|R
40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{locations of}} the monuments in the USGS Hollister trilateration network were adjusted to fit line length observations observed in 1977, using a Bayesian approach, and incorporating prior elevation estimates as data in the adjustment procedure. No significant discrepancies in the measured line lengths were found, but significant <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments</b> (up to 1. 85 m) were needed to fit the length data...|$|R
2500|$|The {{trajectory}} of the bullets is very steep, which makes for a very short point-blank range. This {{was not a significant}} problem at the time of introduction, as the [...]45-70 was a fairly flat-shooting cartridge for its time. Shooters of these early cartridges had to be keen judges of distance, wind and trajectory to make long shots; the Sharps Rifle in larger calibers such as [...]50-110 was used at ranges of [...] Most modern shooters use much higher velocity cartridges, relying on the long point-blank range, and rarely using telescopic sights' <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments,</b> calibrated iron sights, or hold-over. Sights found on early cartridge hunting rifles were quite sophisticated, with a long sighting radius, wide range of <b>elevation,</b> and vernier <b>adjustments</b> to allow precise calibration of the sights for a given range. Even the military [...] "creedmoor" [...] type rifle sights were calibrated and designed to handle extended ranges, flipping up to provide several degrees of <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> if needed. The [...]45-70 is a popular choice for black-powder cartridge shooting events, and replicas of most of the early rifles, including trapdoor, Sharps, and Remington single-shot rifles, are available.|$|R
50|$|In {{the static}} machine gun role, the weapon {{is mounted on}} a tripod that offers {{a higher degree of}} {{accuracy}} and control than the bipod, for example the FN 360° tripod, which features an <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism that enables the weapon's bore axis to be maintained from 300 mm to 600 mm, has a 30° to +15° elevation change and a 360° traverse range.|$|R

50|$|The RPD is {{equipped}} with a set of open-type iron sights. These consist of a front post (adjustable for windage and elevation) and a notched rear sight mounted on a tangent with a sliding <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> knob and marked with range indicators from 100 to 1,000 m (graduated every 100 m). A number of machine guns were fitted with a side rail (attached to {{the left side of the}} receiver) on which a NSP-2 night vision sight could be mounted.|$|R
50|$|The {{hydraulic}} pump was sometimes improperly used {{to dig in}} the rear spade, resulting in damage to the hydraulic spade cylinders {{after the first round}} was fired. The manual backup was used to lay the gun, since the hydraulic control was too coarse. The primary purpose of the {{hydraulic pump}} was putting the barrel into battery, ramming ammunition and charges, raising or lowering the rear spade, rapid course deflection adjustment by the gunner and rapid course <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments</b> by the assistant gunner.|$|R
25|$|The {{sighting}} arrangement {{resembles that}} {{used on the}} AKS-74U and consists of a rear flip-up sight permanently attached to the receiver top cover with two open square notches with 50 and 100 m elevation settings and a round post front sight taken from the AK series of rifles, common to many Russian small arms. The front sight is contained in a protective hood {{with a hole in}} the top to insert an <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> tool, while the rear sight is shielded by two metal ears.|$|R
50|$|The Carl Zeiss Optronics (previously branded as Hensoldt) {{telescopic}} sight has a mil-dot reticle and {{a scale that}} enables the operator to see the dialled in elevation setting through the rifle scopes ocular. The Bundeswehr 3-12×56 SSG {{telescopic sight}} differs somewhat from the further developed 3-12×56 SSG-P telescopic sight. The Bundeswehr telescopic sight has no parallax setting option and the range scale has a setting range from 0 to 10 instead of 0 to 11 symbolizing the 11.2 milliradian <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> range shown in the current Carl Zeiss Optronics 3-12×56 SSG-P telescopic sight brochure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} is a rear sight that adjusts in both directions, though {{military}} rifles {{often have a}} tangent sight in the rear, which a slider on the rear sight has pre-calibrated <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments</b> for different ranges. With tangent sights, the rear sight {{is often used to}} adjust the elevation, and the front the windage. The M16A2 later M16 series rifles have a dial adjustable range calibrated rear sight, and use an elevation adjustable front sight to [...] "zero" [...] the rifle at a given range. The rear sight is used for windage adjustment and to change the zero range.|$|R
5000|$|Precision {{shooting}} at such small targets {{lends itself to}} dialing in <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments</b> {{and for the most}} part when {{shooting at}} high power [...] Kentucky windage a bit less of a factor than with [...] although time-of-flight is the primary factor for windage and, while the power of guns used may be lower, lighter pellets are also used in such guns and the speed of a pellet at the muzzle is only a bit slower (7.2 grains at 825 ft/s versus [...] 890 ft/s, for example). Hence, windage is a similar problem for those shooting at either power in most instances.|$|R
2500|$|For {{designated}} marksman use, the SG 550 {{is equipped}} with a Kern 4x24 telescopic sight on a quick-detachable mount. The sight weighs [...] and includes a variety of features, such as STANAG 2324/MIL-STD-1913 compliant mounting components, a Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> knob for ranges from 100 to 600 m, a tritium-illuminated reticle that enables target acquisition in low-light conditions and a diopter eyesight correction adjustment. Included with the sight is a lens hood for mounting on the ocular that reduces image quality-impairing stray light and a gray filter for glare reduction. The basic model of this optical sight was already used on the Stgw 57.|$|R
50|$|The aiming module is {{installed}} {{in place of}} the standard optical sight and becomes the weapon’s primary sight when mounted, but its main purpose is to accurately determine and indicate the range of a grenade target. The module is powered by a 9 V battery pack, installed in the stock, behind the magazine well. The power pack is also intended to power any other tactical accessories or systems that could be introduced. The FCS integrates a low-power laser rangefinder (precise to within ± 1 m), a day-time aiming channel with an electronically projected reticle, a measured range display reading and a diode <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> indicator.|$|R
40|$|The {{mountain}} {{regions of}} the northeastern United States are a critical socioeconomic resource for Vermont, New York State, New Hampshire, Maine, and southern Quebec. While global climate models (GCMs) are important tools for climate change risk assessment at regional scales, even the increased spatial resolution of statistically downscaled GCMs (commonly approximately 1 / 8 deg) is not sufficient for hydrologic, ecologic, and land-use modeling of small watersheds within the mountainous Northeast. To address this limitation, an ensemble of topographically downscaled, high-resolution (30 "), daily 2 -m maximum air temperature; 2 -m minimum air temperature; and precipitation simulations are developed for the mountainous Northeast by applying an additional level of downscaling to intermediately downscaled (1 / 8 deg) data using high-resolution topography and station observations. First, observed relationships between 2 -m air temperature and elevation and between precipitation and elevation are derived. Then, these relationships are combined with spatial interpolation to enhance the resolution of intermediately downscaled GCM simulations. The resulting topographically downscaled dataset is analyzed {{for its ability to}} reproduce station observations. Topographic downscaling adds value to intermediately downscaled maximum and minimum 2 -m air temperature at high-elevation stations, as well as moderately improves domain-averaged maximum and minimum 2 -m air temperature. Topographic downscaling also improves mean precipitation but not daily probability distributions of precipitation. Overall, the utility of topographic downscaling is dependent on the initial bias of the intermediately downscaled product and the magnitude of the <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment.</b> As the initial bias or <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> increases, more value is added to the topographically downscaled product...|$|R
50|$|For {{designated}} marksman use, the SG 550 can {{be equipped}} with a quick-detachable Kern 4×24 telescopic sight. The sight weighs 730 g and includes a variety of features, such as mounting components, a Bullet Drop Compensation (BDC) <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> knob for ranges from 100 to 800 m, an illuminated reticle that enables target acquisition in low-light conditions and a diopter eyesight correction adjustment. Included with the sight is a lens hood for mounting on the ocular that reduces image quality-impairing stray light and a gray filter for glare reduction. A night vision sight with an infra red light can also be mounted. The Chilean version can fit a German-made Supra 4×24 telescopic sight.|$|R
50|$|The first {{documented}} telescopic rifle sight {{was invented}} between 1835 and 1840. In {{a book titled}} The Improved American Rifle, written in 1844, civil engineer John R. Chapman documented the first telescopic sights made by Morgan James of Utica, NY. Chapman gave James the concepts {{and some of the}} design, whereupon they produced the Chapman-James sight. In 1855, William Malcolm of Syracuse, NY began producing his own sight. Malcolm used an original design incorporating achromatic lenses like those used in telescopes, and improved the windage and <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments.</b> They were between three and twenty magnification (possibly more). Malcolm's and those made by L. M. Amidon of Vermont were the standard during the Civil War.|$|R

50|$|The NEGEV’s iron sights (closed-type) {{consist of}} a front post (adjustable for both windage and elevation) and a rear {{aperture}} sight with an <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> drum, with 300 to 1,000 m range settings. For night-time operation the weapon is equipped with gaseoustritium-illuminated vials (supplied by Betalight): one installed in the front sight post, and two—on a notch sight under the standard aperture sight arm (before use, the rear sight leaf is pivoted forward to expose the night notch sight). A rail is integrated into the receiver top cover that allows optical day and night-time sights to be mounted to the weapon. The barrel can also be optionally fitted with mounting hardware {{that would allow the}} NEGEV to mount a laser pointer or reflex sight.|$|R
50|$|The tripod mount, {{designed}} by L. V. Stepanov for the PKM machine gun entered service in 1969 and weighs 4.5 kg. It is a lighter mount for the PK(M) general-purpose machine gun without affecting {{the accuracy of}} fire. Besides, the Stepanov mount has 20 fewer components than the preceding Samozhenkov tripod and is 40% less labour-intensive.The Stepanov mount {{is based on a}} principle of multi-functional components: the elevation mechanism frame is also used as a pole for kneeled shooting or anti-aircraft fire; the base sleeve also serves as the axis for attaching rear legs of the tripod: the machine gun attachment is combined with the elevation mechanism frame lock for anti-aircraft fire; the fine <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> mechanism is integrated with the elevation mechanism axis. The ammunition belt box can be secured to the right rear tripod leg. This enables one crew member to carry and operate the gun in combat without having to unload the gun before repositioning the gun.|$|R
40|$|The 2007 Noto Hanto {{earthquake}} (M 6. 9) {{occurred in}} the area where the 1 m-Digital Elevation Model had been developed by airbone LiDAR. This data package could provide an exceptional opportunity to study crustal deformation associated with the earthquake. We acquired airbone LiDAR data immediately after the 2007 Noto Hanto Earthquake for comparison. We improved the accuracy of DEM to detect earthquake deformation. As a result, differences of elevation between the flight courses were within ± 0. 05 m according to the <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> for whole area. The resultant elevation change suggests an uplift of the coastal area, including Sekinohana in Shika Town, where a maximum uplift of 0. 45 m was observed. Elevation changes were not observed 3 km from coastline at an extension of the earthquake source fault in sea area. The pattern of the ele-vation change accords well to the results from leveling, GPS, and interferometric SAR data. It was the first attempt in the world to detect crustal deformation associated with an earthquake using airborne LiDAR...|$|R

50|$|There {{is serious}} {{collector}} {{interest in the}} Mosin-Nagant family of rifles, and they are popular with hobby shooters and hunters. The notched rear tangent iron sight is adjustable for elevation, and is calibrated in hundreds of meters (Arshins on earlier models). The front sight is a post that is not adjustable for <b>elevation.</b> Sight <b>adjustment</b> for windage {{was made by the}} armory before issue by drifting the sight left or right in its dovetail.|$|R
5000|$|The main tube of {{telescopic}} sights vary in size, material, {{the applied}} production process and surface finish. The typical outer diameters vary between [...]75 in and 40 mm. The internal {{diameter of the}} telescopic sight main tube influences the area light can pass through, lens elements and other parts can be mounted in and the amount the internal parts for <b>elevation</b> and windage <b>adjustment</b> can move. Telescopic sights intended for long range and/or low light usage generally feature larger main tube diameters. Besides optical, spatial and attainable range of <b>elevation</b> and windage <b>adjustments</b> considerations, larger diameter main tubes offer the possibility to increase the tube walls thickness without sacrificing a lot of internal diameter.|$|R
40|$|Digital {{elevation}} models (DEMs) {{derived from}} airborne lidar are traditionally unreliable in coastal salt marshes {{due to the}} inability of the laser to penetrate the dense grasses and reach the underlying soil. To that end, we present a novel processing methodology that uses ASTER Band 2 (visible red), an interferometric SAR (IfSAR) digital surface model, and lidar-derived canopy height to classify biomass density using both a three- class scheme (high, medium and low) and a two-class scheme (high and low). <b>Elevation</b> <b>adjustments</b> associated with these classes using both median and quartile approaches were applied to adjust lidar-derived elevation values closer to true bare earth elevation. The performance of the method was tested on 229 elevation points in the lower Apalachicola River Marsh. The two-class quartile-based adjusted DEM produced the best results, reducing the RMS error in elevation from 0. 65 m to 0. 40 m, a 38 % improvement. The raw mean errors for the lidar DEM and the adjusted DEM were 0. 61 ± 0. 24 m and 0. 32 ± 0. 24 m, respectively, thereby reducing the high bias by approximately 49 %...|$|R
50|$|The Dragunov {{is issued}} with a quick-detachable PSO-1 optical sight. The PSO-1 sight (at a total length of 375 mm with a lens cover and sun shade, 4× {{magnification}} and 6° field of view) mounts to a proprietary side mount Warsaw Pact rail {{that does not}} block {{the view of the}} iron sight line. The PSO-1 sight includes a variety of features, such as a bullet drop compensation (BDC) <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> knob and an illuminated rangefinder grid that can be used up to 1000 m, a reticle that enables target acquisition in low light conditions as well as an infrared charging screen that is used as a passive detection system. The current version of the sight is the PSO-1M2. This telescopic sight is different from the original PSO-1 only in that it lacks the now obsolete Infra-Red detector. The PSO-1 sight enables area targets to be engaged at ranges upwards of 1300 m; effective ranges in combat situations have been stated at between 600 to 1300 m, depending {{on the nature of the}} target (point or area target) quality of ammunition and skill of the shooter.|$|R
5000|$|The M82 {{features}} an unusual sight arrangement. The {{front and rear}} sights, similar to a Bren light machine gun or some other belt fed machineguns, are offset to the left. The sights are aligned normally with the right eye, but are offset from the barrel about 1.25 inches. This results in the rifles windage being accurate for the zeroed range only. Shots taken at closer ranges to zero will hit {{to the right of}} the target and shots taken at longer ranges will hit to the left of the target. With the sight offset from the barrel by approximately 1.25", if the rifles windage were zeroed at 50 meters, at 100 meters distance the windage error would be about 1.25 inches and at 200 meters distance the windage error would be 3.75 inches. This results in a margin of error making shots over 300 meters difficult. Since the fixed sights do not allow for any <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment,</b> it is clear that this weapon is meant for combat accuracy (6" [...] at 100 meters) at short/urban ranges only and not meant to be a precision sniping tool.|$|R
40|$|Applying climate data in {{resource}} management requires matching the spatial {{scale of the}} climate and resource databases. Interpolating climate data in mountainous regions is difficult. In this study, we present methodology to generate scale-free climate data through the combination of interpolation techniques and <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments.</b> We apply it to monthly temperature and precipitation normals for 1961 – 90 produced by the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) for British Columbia, Yukon Territories, the Alaska Panhandle, and parts of Alberta and the United States. Equations were developed to calculate biologically relevant climate variables including various degree-days, number of frost-free days, frost-free period, and snowfall from monthly temperature and precipitation data. Estimates of climate variables were validated using an independent dataset from weather stations that {{were not included in}} the development of the model. Weather station records generally agreed well with estimated climate variables and showed significant improvements over original PRISM climate data. A stand-alone MS Windows application was developed to perform all calculations and to integrate future climate predictions from various global circulation models. We demonstrate the use of this application by showing how climate change may affect lodgepole pine seed planning zones for reforestation in British Columbia.

40|$|International audienceSince 2000, the European Water Framework Directive has {{required}} managers to restore water bodies to good ecological status, including rivers {{that have been}} substantially anthropomorphized, i. e. {{the vast majority of}} rivers in France. This obligation creates situations, such as removal of mill sluice gates and strong resistance from local stakeholders that must be addressed by governmental agencies and local elected officials. Seine watershed researchers have suggested using a hydraulic model to give river managers an overall vision of structure function (including sluice gates) and the water <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustments</b> between the upstream and downstream reaches with adjustments to the structures. Scientists adapted their model with the collaboration of the local actors in charge of the river management. This simulation of the management of river structures was achieved by constructing an interactive platform and using it to simulate annual flow scenarios for the river and management objective scenarios for all types of use, both recreational and high- and low-water scenarios. Model construction and simulation reunited scientists; State services agents, elected officials but also mill owners and members of local associations. The objective of this collective use was to allow managers to appreciate the current knowledge on the effects that removing a structure would have, around a multifunctional approach to the river, to consider removal of certain structures depending on the locally expected results...|$|R
5000|$|Because at {{the time}} the Model 52 was {{developed}} many Army- and National Rifle Association-sponsored matches were restricted to [...] "military-style" [...] sights, and because Winchester had hopes of selling the 52 to the War Department as a marksmanship training rifle, Burton and Laudensack designed a folding ladder sight for the new target rifle. Designated 82A, it bore some resemblance to the sight on the M1903 Springfield, especially in its pivoting-base windage adjustment (albeit controlled by dual-opposed thumbscrews rather than the Springfield rack-and-worm). However, <b>elevation</b> <b>adjustment</b> was governed by a micrometer click-wheel for precision, not free-sliding like genuine military sights. The Burton-Laudensack helped Model 52 shooters sweep matches and set records throughout the 1920s, but more precise aftermarket sights took over the field and the increasingly obsolescent 82A was not offered after World War II.Winchester catalogs from the beginning listed 52's with sights by other makers; indeed, the buyer could specify any compatible peep on a special-order basis. The most common of these was the Lyman 48 series: the 48-J and -JH for flat-top dovetail-mount receivers, and the 48-F and -FH for round-top side-mount rifles (standard on the 52 Sporting Model). Other popular sights were the Lyman 525, the Wittek-Vaver 35-MIELT, the Marble Goss 52, and the Redfield 90 and 100. Late 52's frequently were fitted with Redfield [...] "Olympic" [...] or [...] "International" [...] match sights.|$|R
