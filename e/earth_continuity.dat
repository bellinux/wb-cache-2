50|$|AS/NZS 3760:2010 is a {{standard}} created by Standards Australia that outlines a testing method and frequency for electrical appliances. It was created to minimize electrical hazards in the workplace. Appliances are inspected for damage, and various measurements are made to the appliances' <b>earth</b> <b>continuity,</b> insulation, polarity, and physical condition. After testing has determined a pass, a tag {{is attached to the}} appliance lead indicating when it was tested, when the next test is due, and a tracking code. Retesting intervals of equipment can vary from 3 months to 5 years, depending of the environment where the equipment is located.|$|E

50|$|At {{the basic}} level PAT test {{instruments}} carry out basic safety checks. Most {{are equipped with}} an <b>earth</b> <b>continuity</b> test, insulation resistance test {{and the ability to}} check the wiring of detachable mains cords. Many do not however include tests which involve applying mains power to the appliance under test, for example, a protective conductor current or touch current tests. The main kind for businesses are simple PASS/FAIL testers that are easy to use, and are aimed at in-house PAT testing with minimal interpretation of results. Advanced PAT testers can give much more information and testing features but are mainly aimed at more highly skilled users.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} tunnel {{installations}} of extra high voltage (EHV) power cables. Cross-bonding of the screens remains the usual earthing arrangements of cable systems, if their extension {{is greater than}} 1, 5 km approximately. Such EHV cable systems need a functional earthing along the route in correspondence of each major section, at the sending and at the receiving ends. Given the difficulties involved with the realization of these earthing systems, other techniques should be sought for. In this paper two different methods to earth the cable screens are taken into account: the former is obtained by means {{of one or more}} <b>earth</b> <b>continuity</b> conductors (ECCs), whereas the latter relies on the tunnel steel reinforcement (TSR) itself. Each method is discussed and analyzed both in terms of safety issues and stray currents...|$|E
50|$|Rainbow Girl: Dori Aandraison of {{the planet}} Xolnar. Possesses the ability to wield {{the power of the}} {{emotional}} spectrum, causing unpredictable mood swings from angry (red), to hopeful (blue), to confident (green), and others. She only appeared once, as a rejected Legion applicant in pre-Crisis on Infinite <b>Earths</b> <b>continuity,</b> and originally had the power to separate into four different-colored versions of herself. Red was heat, Blue was cold, Yellow was brightness, and Green was Kryptonite. She was rejected because her Green Kryptonite self posed a threat to Superboy and Supergirl.|$|R
50|$|In the post-Crisis on Infinite <b>Earths</b> <b>continuity,</b> {{a version}} of Lyla appears in the six part story arc Superman: Godfall (2004), written by Joe Kelly and Michael Turner, with art by Talent Caldwell. This Lyla, whose last name is not revealed, is an alien empath to a society that persecuted all aliens, but empaths in particular. Simply being one {{was to have a}} death sentence. Her father told her all of the old myths about the Superman as she grew up and she became steeped in the belief of a power greater than her that was guiding her life.

Inspired by the dream, she creates a colorful costume and becomes Miss America, one of America's first heroines. In truth, she had been abducted by the top secret government agency, Project M, and her powers were actually {{the result of a}} secret experiment. They believed the experiment to be a failure and had returned her to whence she had been taken, leaving her none the wiser.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Sustainable {{development}} {{is one of}} the most debated issues, recently. In terms of providing more livable <b>Earth</b> <b>continuity,</b> while Production activities are going on, on the other hand protecting the environment has importance. As a strategy for sustainable development, eco-innovation is the application of innovations to reduce environmental burdens. Endeavors to understand eco-innovation processes have been affected from environmental economics and innovation economics from neoclassical economics, and evolutionary economics other than neoclassical economics. In the light of case study analyses, this study aims to display activities in this field through case studies after explaining the theoretical framework of eco-innovations. This study consists of five sections including introduction and conclusion. In the second part of the study identifications of the concepts related with eco-innovation are described and eco-innovations are classified. Third section considers neoclassical and evolutionary approaches from neoclassical economics and evolutionary economics, respectively. Fourth section gives the case studies of successful eco-innovations. Last section is the conclusion part and offers suggestions for future eco-innovation research according to the theoretical framework and the case studies...|$|E

50|$|The {{people now}} known as Daxamites were {{originally}} Kryptonians who left their homeworld in order to explore the universe. (In post-Crisis on Infinite <b>Earths</b> <b>continuity,</b> the Eradicator, an artificial lifeform programmed to preserve all Kryptonian culture, altered the birthing matrices ("artificial wombs") that the explorers took with them so that all newborns would be fatally vulnerable to lead and other materials such as greenhouse gases and certain rocks.) Thus, if they persisted in their anti-Kryptonian wanderlust, they would all die from it. One Daxamite, Mon-El, was poisoned by lead and preserved in the Phantom Zone until a cure was found by Brainiac 5 in the 30th century, whereafter Mon-El {{became a member of}} the Legion of Super-Heroes.|$|R

Initially appearing along with Triplicate Girl and Saturn Girl in Action Comics #276 in the story [...] "Supergirl's Three Super Girl-Friends", her first costume consisted of white tights and a white cape with a stylized P on the chest. Phantom Girl's powers serve her well as member of the Legion's Espionage Squad, and she is involved romantically with fellow Legionnaire Ultra Boy for many years. In this continuity, she has a brother, Gmya Wazzo.|$|R
5000|$|Portable {{appliance}} testing (commonly {{known as}} [...] "PAT", [...] "PAT Inspection" [...] or (redundantly) as [...] "PAT Testing") {{is the name}} of a process in the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, New Zealand and Australia by which electrical appliances are routinely checked for safety. The formal term for the process is [...] "in-service inspection & testing of electrical equipment". Testing involves a visual inspection of the equipment and any flexible cables for good condition, and also where required, verification of grounding (<b>earthing)</b> <b>continuity,</b> and a test of the soundness of insulation between the current carrying parts, and any exposed metal that may be touched. The formal limits for pass/fail of these electrical tests vary somewhat depending on the category of equipment being tested.|$|R
