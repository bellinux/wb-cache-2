40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{associations}} between (<b>improvement</b> <b>in)</b> fatigue and (<b>improvement</b> <b>in)</b> clinical and cognitive factors {{in patients with}} chronic widespread pain (CWP), participating in multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment. Methods: Data were used from baseline, 6 and 18 months of follow-up during a prospective cohort study of 120 CWP patients who completed multidisciplinary rehabilitation treatment. Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships were analyzed between fatigue, clinical (i. e. pain, interference of pain and depression) and pain related cognitive factors (i. e. negative emotional cognitions, active cognitive coping, and control and chronicity beliefs). Results: Higher levels of pain, interference of pain, depression, negative emotional cognitions, and negative control and chronicity beliefs were associated with {{a higher level of}} fatigue. <b>Improvement</b> <b>in</b> depression was related to <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> fatigue. Conclusions: In CWP patients, worse clinical status, and dysfunctional pain-related cognitions are associated with a higher level of fatigue. Our results suggest that <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> depression might be a mechanism of <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> fatigue. Furthermore, <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> fatigue seems to be independent of <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> pain related cognitions. Targeting fatigue in multidisciplinary pain treatment may need specific strategies. Implications for RehabilitationImprovement in depression may be a mechanism of change to improve the level of fatigue <b>in</b> CWP. <b>Improvement</b> <b>in</b> dysfunctional (pain related) cognitions seems to be independent of <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> fatigue.

30|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that lurasidone significantly improved symptoms of bipolar depression and functional impairment (Loebel et al. 2014 a, b). The current analysis extends these findings by assessing if <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> functional impairment (SDS) due to lurasidone treatment was independent of <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> bipolar depression symptoms (MADRS). Path analysis revealed that <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> SDS total scores was largely but not completely explained by <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> MADRS. The remaining statistically significant and medium-strength direct effect (β = − 0.17), after accounting for the indirect effect of MADRS change on SDS total score change (57  % of the total effect), revealed that treatment had an independent effect on <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> functional impairment.|$|R
