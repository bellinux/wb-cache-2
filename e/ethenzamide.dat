50|$|<b>Ethenzamide</b> is {{a common}} {{analgesic}} and anti-inflammatory drug that {{is used for the}} relief of fever, headaches, and other minor aches and pains. It is an ingredient in numerous cold medications and many prescription analgesics.|$|E
50|$|Diproqualone is {{the only}} {{analogue}} of methaqualone that is still in widespread clinical use, due to its useful anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects {{in addition to the}} sedative and anxiolytic actions common to other drugs of this class. There are still some concerns about the potential of diproqualone for abuse and overdose, and so it is not sold as a pure drug but only as the camphosulfonate salt in combination mixtures with other medicines such as <b>ethenzamide.</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract-In {{our studies}} with drug combinations, we searched for {{mixtures}} which would enhance {{the effectiveness of}} the related active substances. <b>Ethenzamide</b> was found to possess a specific suppressive effect on the gastric damage induced by aspirin. Such effect could not be demonstrated in analgesic agents such as salicylamide, bucetin, acetaminophen and phenacetin. The combination of aspirin with <b>ethenzamide</b> had a potentiating effect on analgesic activity and reduced motor incoordination and loss of righting reflex. We calculated the safety margins of various ratios of combinations and concluded that the best was aspirin and <b>ethenzamide</b> at a ratio of 2 : 3. The general principle in considering drug combinations containing two or more in gredients is to evaluate not only the enhancement of the main effect and/or the magnification of the pharmacological spectrum of each ingredient but also the usefulness of the combi nation from the standpoint of total effect. We further propose that this principle should include increasing the safety margin so that drug combinations have greater safety margins than do the ingredients as single entities (1, 2, 3). Aspirin although in wide use does induce gastrointestinal damage. As such an untoward effect often limits extensive clinical application, we searched for a compound which would enhance the usefulness of aspirin when used in combination with other agents.

40|$|<b>Ethenzamide</b> solids as a {{representative}} active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) were batch-ground {{by means of a}} fluidized-bed jet-mill which is a relatively new equipment and promising for production in the pharmaceutical field. Thus, the characteristic grinding mechanism was investigated. As a result, the variation of the residual ratio with grinding time after milling was expressed simply by a mathematical model using only the first Kapur function, and it was consistent with experimental data satisfactorily. As the shape of the function was much different from that of inorganic compound and peculiar to API, a cubic function with respect to particle diameter was defined newly and well fitted to the experimental data. The function was also found to be affected by the operating parameters as the grinding gas pressure, the charge weight of raw material and the linear velocity at the grinding nozzle. According to the assessments of the breakage and the selection functions derived from the first Kapur function, {{it was found that the}} grinding mechanism of <b>Ethenzamide</b> particles was related with particle attrition mainly...|$|E
