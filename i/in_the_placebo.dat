40|$|ABSTRACT – This paper {{reviews the}} {{psychological}} mechanisms {{that lead to}} <b>placebo</b> responses and <b>the</b> physiological basis for reduction in symp-toms. Some psychologica l mechanisms (expectancy, conditioning) lead to symptom reduction but are unlikely to reduce underlying pathology. Other mechanisms (therapeutic relationship, empowerment) may additionally reduce later pathology. The nature, size and duration of <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> response depends on <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> inducing context. <b>In</b> clinical practice, <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> response creates an adjunctive response to that of active treatment.

2500|$|If one reviews <b>in</b> detail <b>the</b> various {{published}} angiogenesis clinical trials, it can {{be realized}} {{that most of these}} trials had success in achieving various secondary or supportive endpoints, but failed when attempting to demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in exercise performance, typically done by a treadmill exercise test. Perhaps the greatest reason for these trials' failure to achieve success is the high occurrence of the [...] "placebo effect" [...] in studies employing treadmill exercise test readout. Thus, even though a majority of <b>the</b> treated patients <b>in</b> these trials experience relief of such clinical symptoms as chest pain (angina), and generally performed better on most efficacy readouts, there were enough [...] "responders" [...] <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blinded <b>placebo</b> groups to render <b>the</b> trial inconclusive. <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect, more recent animal studies have also highlighted various factors that may inhibit an angiogenesis response, including certain drugs, smoking, and hypercholesterolemia.|$|R

25|$|Mortality from {{untreated}} PEs {{was said}} to be 26%. This figure comes from a trial published in 1960 by Barrit and Jordan, which compared anticoagulation against placebo for the management of PE.

This study is the only placebo controlled trial ever to examine the place of anticoagulants in the treatment of PE, the results of which were so convincing that the trial has never been repeated as to do so would be considered unethical. That said, the reported mortality rate of 26% <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> group is probably an overstatement, given that the technology of the day may have detected only severe PEs.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{propose that}} <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect is {{mediated}} by reward-related mechanisms. Recent {{evidence suggests that}} it is the expecta-tion of reward (<b>in</b> this case, <b>the</b> expectation of clinical benefit) that triggers <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> response. <b>In</b> Parkinson’s disease, <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect is mediated by the release of dopamine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> striatum. The authors argue that placebo-induced dopamine release in limbic struc-tures, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nucleus accumbens, could also be a major biochemical substrate for <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect encountered <b>in</b> other medical disorders.

25|$|Data exist {{from both}} {{observational}} and randomized clinical trials regarding {{the association between}} menopausal hormone replacement therapy (menopausal HRT) and breast cancer. The largest meta-analysis (1997) of data from 51 observational studies, indicated a relative {{risk of breast cancer}} of 1.35 for women who had used HRT for 5 or more years after menopause. The estrogen-plus-progestin arm of the Women's Health Initiative (WHI), a randomized controlled trial, which randomized more than 16,000 postmenopausal women to receive combined hormone therapy or placebo, was halted early (2002) because health risks exceeded benefits. One of the adverse outcomes prompting closure was a significant increase in both total and invasive breast cancers (hazard ratio = 1.24) in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years. HRT-related breast cancers had adverse prognostic characteristics (more advanced stages and larger tumors) compared with cancers occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> group, and HRT was also associated with a substantial increase in abnormal mammograms. Short-term use of hormones for treatment of menopausal symptoms appears to confer little or no breast cancer risk. A correlation was found between the use of hormonal contraceptives and subsequent reliance on hormone replacement therapy.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{quantify}} <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect magnitude on endurance running performance, in 'real-world' field-based {{head-to-head competition}} settings, of an injected placebo ('OxyRBX') purporting to have similar effects to {{recombinant human erythropoietin}} (r-HuEPO). METHODS: 15 endurance-trained club-level men (age: 27. 5 +/- 6. 8 years, BMI: 22. 9 +/- 2. 0 kg[middle dot]m- 2), with personal best 10 km times of 39. 3 +/- 4. 4 min (mean+/-SD), completed the randomised cross-over study design of 3 km races before and after 7 -day 'control' and 'placebo' phases. During <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> phase participants self-administered subcutaneous saline injections daily, believing it to be OxyRBX, with no intervention during the control phase. At the start and end of each 7 -day phase 3 km running performance was assessed. Qualitative assessments of participants' perceptions and experiences were recorded throughout and in semi-structured interviews on completion. RESULTS: Race time improved significantly more <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> intervention (9. 73 +/- 1. 96 s faster, P= 0. 0005), than {{in response to control}} (1. 82 +/- 1. 94 s faster, P= 0. 41) (P interaction = 0. 02). <b>In</b> response to <b>the</b> <b>placebo,</b> participants reported reductions in physical effort, increased potential motivation and improved recovery.

2500|$|It was {{previously}} assumed that placebo response rates {{in patients with}} chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are unusually high, [...] "at least 30% to 50%", because of the subjective reporting of symptoms and the fluctuating nature of the condition. According to a meta-analysis and contrary to conventional wisdom, the pooled response rate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> group was 19.6%, even lower than in some other medical conditions. The authors offer possible explanations for this result: CFS is widely understood {{to be difficult to}} treat, which could reduce expectations of improvement. In context of evidence showing placebos do not have powerful clinical effects when compared to no treatment, a low rate of spontaneous remission in CFS could contribute to reduced improvement rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> group. Intervention type also contributed to the heterogeneity of the response.

25|$|Motivation may {{contribute}} to <b>the</b> <b>placebo</b> effect. <b>The</b> active goals of an individual changes their somatic experience by altering the detection and interpretation of expectation-congruent symptoms, and by changing the behavioral strategies a person pursues.
