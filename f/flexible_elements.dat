High precision alignment tasks might not be possible when friction or stiction are present. Additionally, conventional bearings or linear slides often exhibit positioning hysteresis due to backlash and friction. Flexures are able to achieve much lower resolution limits (in some cases measured in the nanometer scale), because they depend on bending and/or torsion of <b>flexible</b> <b>elements,</b> rather than surface interaction of many parts (as with a ball bearing).

Without this basic feature, in fact, no structural analysis could be considered reliable. If this characteristic is absent, strengthening the bearing masonry – by giving it a transversal monolithic behavior- {{is one of the}} first retrofitting actions to undertake in order to improve the seismic performance of the masonry.
