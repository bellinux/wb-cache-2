5|$|Adaptation is {{the central}} unifying concept in {{behavioural}} ecology. Behaviours can be recorded as traits and inherited <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way that eye and hair colour can. Behaviours can evolve by means of natural selection as adaptive traits conferring functional utilities that increases reproductive fitness.|$|E
5|$|Although the XCG-17 {{failed to}} lead to any {{production}} of a C-47 derived glider type, a single C-47 was converted {{in the field to}} glider configuration by the Fifth Air Service Area Command, located at Nichols Field on Luzon in the Philippines, during January 1946. Carried out <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> manner as the XCG-17, the conversion included octagonally shaped fairings over the engine mountings, with an auxiliary power unit from a B-24 Liberator bomber being installed.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{way that}} there is a {{national}} coat of arms, each province and territory possesses its own unique arms; Saskatchewan's is known formally as Her Majesty's Arms in Right of Saskatchewan. The year after Confederation, Queen Victoria issued Royal Warrants assigning arms to Canada's original four provinces: Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, NY365's old routing between Harrietstown and Gabriels was {{designated}} as NY192A, a spur route of NY192. NY192A {{was removed from}} the state highway system on January7, 1980, when NY192 was rerouted east of Gabriels to follow NY192A. On March28, 1989, NY192 was eliminated <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as its spur route as NY86 was rerouted to follow NY192 through Gabriels to Paul Smiths. NY86's former routing past the Adirondack Regional Airport became NY186.|$|E

5|$|Like Lovinescu, other {{advocates of}} modernist {{literature}} rejected most of Cerna's contributions. One {{of the first}} to have done so is Ovid Densusianu, who stated his belief that an artist's work should be separated from his life. Lovinescu, who commented on Densusianu and his thoughts on Cerna, opined that Densusianu had a tendency to reject all poets who registered popular success, and that he treated Dimitrie Anghel's work <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum {{deficiency}} {{has also}} been reported {{as a consequence of}} non-molybdenum supplemented total parenteral nutrition (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of sulfite and urate, <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as molybdenum cofactor deficiency. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.|$|E
5|$|Nanosilver particles, between 10 and 100nanometres in size, {{are used}} in many applications. They {{are used in}} {{conductive}} inks for printed electronics, and have a much lower melting point than larger silver particles of micrometre size. They are also used medicinally in antibacterials and antifungals <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as larger silver particles.|$|E
50|$|Calogiuri vincotti {{are also}} {{produced}} {{in a variety}} of aromatized or flavoured versions <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as flavoured extra virgin olive oils. Locally grown fruits are used, including fig, carob, lemon, orange, raspberry, or chili pepper. This is an adaptation of traditional Apulian vincotto, but {{should not be confused with}} the understanding of generic Apulian vincotti.|$|R

5|$|The control {{surfaces}} operated <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as other aircraft, {{with the exception}} of the innovative automatic pull-out system. Releasing the bomb initiated the pull-out, or automatic recovery and climb, upon the deflection of the dive brakes. The pilot could override the system by exerting significant force on the control column and taking manual control.|$|E
5|$|The form of kingdom which {{appeared}} in Constantine's reign continued <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way until the Davidian Revolution in the 12th century.

5|$|The objects {{created by}} amphiphiles are usually spherical (as {{in the case}} of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These {{anisotropic}} self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).|$|E
5|$|Beyond minor improvements, MD410 in Montgomery County has {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> state since 1950. The only major change was the highway being split onto a one-way pair of streets in Bethesda in 1988. The Prince George's County section has seen more substantial changes over the intervening decades. The first {{major change in}} alignment occurred in 1956, when MD410 was completed on a new alignment as a four-lane divided highway between Ager Road just east of MD212 and MD500 at what is now Adelphi Road. The state highway was subsequently extended east over what was previously MD403, known as Colesville Road, to US1 in Riverdale.|$|E
5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause gastroenteritis, salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E

5|$|It is an {{outstanding}} example of a late medieval aisled barn and is the largest timber-framed building in England. Barns of this type {{were based on a}} longitudinal frame, with two rows of posts connected by arcade plates. Because such barns tend to be both long and high, they experience high structural loads from the wind. They therefore have numerous internal braces, acting <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as buttresses, to strengthen the structure. This gives the barn its distinctive internal appearance, with a lattice of beams and braces holding up the roof. The techniques used in its construction are similar to those employed on the great cathedrals being built at the time, and some of the same craftsmen were probably involved.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon became}} {{evident that the}} Dominicans needed to {{reestablish}} themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, while de las Casas was in Spain, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, placed the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real. The Dominicans dedicated themselves to destroying indigenous temples and idols, and preached sermons with destructive imagery, such as from the Book of Revelation, that were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview. Saints were associated with animals, <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> way as the Indians identified themselves with nahual spirit-forms. Different Mesoamerican otherworlds were tied to Christian concepts, where the Mictlan world of the dead became Hell, Ihuicatl became Heaven, and Tlalocan became Paradise.|$|E
5|$|So far, the {{investigation}} {{had been on}} the natural frequency of transient oscillation of a resonant circuit resulting from a sudden stimulus. More important {{from the point of view}} of filter theory is the behaviour of a resonant circuit when driven by an external AC signal: there is a sudden peak in the circuit's response when the driving signal frequency is at the resonant frequency of the circuit. James Clerk Maxwell heard of the phenomenon from Sir William Grove in 1868 in connection with experiments on dynamos, and was also aware of the earlier work of Henry Wilde in 1866. Maxwell explained resonance mathematically, with a set of differential equations, <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> terms that an RLC circuit is described today.|$|E
