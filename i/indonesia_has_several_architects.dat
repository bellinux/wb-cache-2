The quality of student activities can be enhanced through the effective use of e-learning. The Yogyakarta State University (YSU) <b>Indonesia</b> <b>has</b> been implementing the e-learning system called BESMART since 2006. It was developed using the Learning Management Systems of Moodle. The implementation of the e-learning system in some schools and universities in <b>Indonesia</b> <b>has</b> <b>several</b> obstacles such as low bandwidth of internet connection, lacks of teacher’s computer skills, limited numbers of accessing terminals, no supporting policy for implementing e-learning methods and other administrative stuff.

This paper will discuss about the integration of ICT into teaching and learning process by the implementation of blended learning in order to increase the quality of student learning activities at the YSU Indonesia. The blended learning is a combination of e-learning and traditional classrooms. It can be the accommodation of the best elements of e-learning contents consisting of items like simulations, virtual laboratory, and online discussions into a face-to-face learning. The student activities that can be enhanced by the effective use of blended learning include online collaboration and discussion, online quizzes and assignments, online inquiry and explorations, as well as any individual activities such as e-reflections, e-journal, blogs, e-portfolios. Other conventional face-to-face activities can still be incorporated in the blended learning such as tutorials, practicum, project work and laboratory work...|$|R
