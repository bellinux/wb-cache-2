40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed {{to analyze the}} effect of test {{parameters}} on DRM results from OLTC and its implementation in the condition assessment. Two test parameters were selected to be observed, which are test current and circuit resistance. Their amplitude was varied during the measurements and experiments in the laboratory {{as well as in}} the field (substation). To quantify the measurement results, an analytical tool was introduced. Its purpose is to convert the DRM results into 4 parameters. They are plotted as curves, in such a way that particular behaviours of the curves determine the influence of the test parameters. Further on, the influence of test parameters has been utilized to determine an optimum level of test parameter. It is used to conduct the measurement to gain reliable results. Then with the help of three dimensional classification system, the actual condition of OLTC can be identified. It shall simplify the condition assessment of OLTC. <b>High</b> <b>Voltage</b> <b>Component</b> and Power SystemsElectrical Power EngineeringElectrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Scienc...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{sustained}} corona discharge in insulating oil lowers its dielectric strength and simultaneously reduces its corona resistance. Therefore, for operating stresses in the corona regime, activity typically increases with time and, if allowed to continue, eventually leads to breakdown of the oil and failure of the component or system. It is, therefore, common practice to periodically replace oil in devices such as large power transformers and switch gear before breakdown occurs. Sealed components such as capacitors are typically replaced. Recent experiments have demonstrated that the dielectric properties of corona weakened oil can not only be restored, but actually improved by a simple regeneration process. These experiments were carried out on high voltage pulse transformer windings which were operated at high rep rates until partial discharges formed. Reprocessing the oil after each operating cycle resulted in successively longer operational periods before partial discharges appeared. In a separate experiment, a process was developed to precondition transformer oil to raise its corona inception voltage before using it to insulate a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>component,</b> thus giving it a longer initial service life for a given operating stress or permitting higher stress operation for limited operating times...|$|E
40|$|In {{high voltage}} {{engineering}} the dielectric response technique {{is a widely}} used tool both for characterization of insulation materials and for diagnostics of components such as transformers and cables. Currently available techniques are not capable of measuring on-line which would be advantageous; when characterizing a material and evaluating the effect of different voltage magnitudes, waveforms and temperatures it is desirable {{to be able to}} observe the continuous development of the dielectric properties. Present diagnostic techniques based on dielectric response need to disconnect the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>component</b> from the grid in order for measurements to be performed, which is a major drawback. Apart from the inconvenience of removing a part of the power system from operation, measurements are performed with voltages and for temperatures unlike those experienced in operation which can provide misleading results. In addition, the possibility of continuous online monitoring would also provide increased opportunities for condition based maintenance (CBM). In this thesis an approach towards dielectric response measurements utilizing the harmonic content of any applied repetitive voltage is introduced. This measurement technique can utilize voltage waveforms already present in the system which makes external test voltage sources superfluous. By measuring the applied voltage and the corresponding current response, the voltage and current spectra can be obtained using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). With the use of calibrations and a detailed circuit model, the dielectric response for many harmonics can be obtained simultaneously. This approach towards dielectric response measurements has been evaluated and compared with commercial instruments operating in the frequency domain. The agreement is good and shows that the technique as implemented here has the same accuracy level as conventional techniques. In addition, some examples of applications are shown which illustrate possible studies that previous techniques were unable to perform. The technique can be used for low voltage, high voltage and online measurements, each with its own limitations and specific set of requirements necessary for obtaining accurate results...|$|E
40|$|The {{demand on}} {{reducing}} circuit breaker failure, extending service life, increasing equipment reliability and lowering the related operating and maintenance costs are nowadays of prime {{importance for the}} electricity supply network. According to statistics, the major failure mode is originated from operating mechanism, whereas interrupter has {{the highest percentage of}} failure in <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>component.</b> Thus, the method to facilitate the assessment of internal mechanical conditions by using commercially available devices without opening major parts and the experimental investigation on electrical erosion inside the interrupter were performed in this work. The experimental investigation on the mechanical endurance of operating mechanism up to 6, 000 no-load switching was performed with 110 kV puffer type circuit breakers due to its requirement of large driving energy for hydraulic operating mechanism. The conventional measurement, e. g. coil current, contact timing, dynamic contact resistance and pumping motor current as well as additional vibration technique were carried out in both laboratory and field test. The investigation on electrical erosion focusing on aging of nozzle and electrode under current interruption was performed with a reduced-size SF 6 self-blast circuit breaker model and synthetic test circuit, providing the current density comparable to that in the real circuit breaker, because of the extensive use of nozzle ablation, the possibility for parameters variation and the reduction of cost and time. For mechanical investigation, the parameters were measured at the beginning as a reference and also thereafter every 500 switching under normal and variable operating conditions, e. g. variation of auxiliary supply voltage, hydraulic oil pressure and SF 6 gas pressure. The test result was verified by that from two of the same type circuit breakers and the theoretical calculation for vibration result in the frequency-domain analysis. Subsequently, the on-site measurement before and after maintenance and some simulated defects were executed. The electrical aging investigation was performed by successive tests with constant energy stresses until interrupting failure occurred. The effect of current amplitude, nozzle diameter, expansion volume, arcing time and recovery voltage on mass losses, geometry changes of nozzle and its influence on pressure build-up were investigated. The analysis of vibration signals in a combination with the other supervised parameters provides the useful information regarding the significant events occurring inside during circuit breaker operation, e. g. motion start of mechanism and within pole, contact touching and motion stop. The deviations of these measured values from the reference according to number of no-load switching operations, variable operating conditions and some incorporated defects were comprehensively determined. The relationship between the gradual changes in technical status of the supervised components and the number of no-load operations is helpful for selecting the proper maintenance method. Regarding the electrical erosion of the nozzle and the electrodes, the mass losses per switching and per energy; and the geometry change of nozzle especially between the arcing column and the expansion chamber were investigated. Moreover, volume loss and mass loss along the nozzle column; its effect on the pressure build-up reduction; and the dependences of mass losses on interrupting current amplitude, charge and generated heat have been determined. Furthermore by applying the wear equivalent law, the allowable number of interruption in function of the breaking current to rated short-circuit current ratio and the remaining lifetime can be determined. This result will be used to verify the accuracy of simulation tools in order to visualize the aging process, to evaluate the interrupter condition and to minimize the expensive experiment tests...|$|E

Advances in the state of the art in high power electric power systems enable high horsepower electric actuators, such as the electromechnical actuator (EMA) and the electro-hydrostatic actuator (EHA), to be used in launch vehicle TVC systems, dramaticly reducing weight, complexity and operating costs.

40|$|The {{presence}} of partial discharges (PD) in <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>components</b> is generally {{a sign of}} defects and degradation in the electrical insulation. To diagnose the condition of <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> insulation, PD measurements is commonly used. The Variable Frequency Phase Resolved PD Analysis (VF-PRPDA) technique measures PD at variable frequency of the applied voltage. With this technique, the frequency dependence of PD can be utilized to extract {{more information about the}} insulation defects than is possible from traditional PD measurements at a single applied frequency. In this thesis the PD process in a disc-shaped cavity is measured and modelled at variable frequency (0. 01 - 100 Hz) of the applied voltage. The aim is to interpret the PD frequency dependence in terms of physical conditions at the cavity. The measurements show that the PD process in the cavity is frequency dependent. The PD phase and magnitude distributions, as well as the number of PDs per voltage cycle, change with the varying frequency. Moreover, the PD frequency dependence changes with the applied voltage amplitude, the size of the cavity and the location of the cavity (insulated or electrode bounded). A physical model is presented and used to dynamically simulate the sequence of PDs in the cavity at different applied frequencies. The simulations show that essential features in the measured PD patterns can be reproduced. The PD frequency dependence is interpreted as a variation in influence on the PD activity from the statistical time lag of PD and the charge transport in the cavity surface, at different applied frequencies. The simulation results also show that certain cavity parameters, like the cavity surface conductivity and the rate of electron emission from the cavity surface, change with the time between consecutive PDs, and accordingly with the applied frequency. This effect also contributes to the PD frequency dependence. QC 2010072...|$|R

The application of Wavelet Packet Transform (WPT) to extract partial discharge signals buried in excessive noise is described in this paper. The denoising technique, applied to numerical signals, is based on an energy criterion in conjunction with hard-thresholdin...|$|R
