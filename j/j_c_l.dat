40|$|Abstract. AP- 1 and AP- 2 {{adaptors}} are recruited {{onto the}} TGN and plasma membrane, respectively. GTP�S stimulates {{the recruitment of}} AP- 1 onto the TGN but causes AP- 2 to bind to an endosomal compartment (Seaman, M. N. <b>J.,</b> <b>C.</b> <b>L.</b> Ball, and M. S. Robinson. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 123 : 1093 – 1105). We have used subcellular fractionation followed by Western blotting, as well as immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy, to investigate both the recruitment of AP- 2 adaptors onto the plasma membrane and their targeting to endosomes, and we have also examined the recruitment of AP- 1 under the same conditions. Two lines of evidence indicate that the GTP�S-induced targeting of AP- 2 to endosomes is mediated by ADP-ribosylation factor- 1 (ARF 1). First, GTP�S loses its effect whe...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{establish}} the magnetic carriers and assess the reliability of previous paleomagnetic results obtained for Eocene marine marls from the south Pyrenean basin, we carried out a combined paleo- and rock-magnetic study of the Pamplona-Arguis Formation, which crops out in the western sector of the southern Pyrenees (N Spain). The unblocking temperatures suggest that the characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) is carried by magnetite and iron sulphides. The ChRM has both normal and reversed polarities {{regardless of whether it}} resides in magnetite or iron sulphides, and represents a primary Eocene magnetization acquired before folding. Rock magnetic results confirm the presence of magnetite and smaller amounts of magnetic iron sulphides, most likely pyrrhotite, in all the studied samples. Framboidal pyrite is ubiquitous in the marls and suggests that iron sulphides formed during early diagenesis under sulphate-reducing conditions. ChRM directions carried by magnetic iron sulphides are consistent with those recorded by magnetite. These observations suggest that magnetic iron sulphides carry a chemical remanent magnetization that coexists with a remanence residing in detrital magnetite. We suggest that the south Pyrenean Eocene marls are suitable for magnetostratigraphic and tectonic purposes but not for studies of polarity transitions, secular variations and geomagnetic excursions, because it is difficult to test for short time differences in remanence lock-in time for the two minerals. The presence of iron sulphide minerals contributing to the primary magnetization in Eocene marine marls reinforces the idea that these minerals can persist {{over long periods of time}} in the geological record. <b>J.</b> <b>C.</b> <b>L.</b> acknowledges financial support from the CSIC-DFG and the U.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{depth of}} penetration of melittin into egg phosphatidylcholine and bovine heart cardiolipin model membranes was investigated using fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. The tryptophan intrinsic fluorescence shift suggests a more hydrophobic surrounding of this residue in cardiolipin, while the accessibility for charged and uncharged aqueous quenchers is decreased in the cardiolipin system {{when compared with the}} phosphatidylcholine-bound situation. A lipid incorporated hydrophobic, collisional quencher and a resonance energy transfer acceptor on the other hand are more effective in quenching the tryptophan fluorescence of cardiolipin bound melittin. The combination of these results is interpreted as prove of a deeper positioning of the tryptophan containing part of the peptide molecule in the cardiolipin system in comparison with the situation in phosphatidylcholine. Models that take this difference into account are presented, which try to explain the opposite effect of melittin binding to the two lipid systems with respect to supramolecular structure, as reported in the preceding article (Batenburg, A.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the fate of Golgi membranes during mitotic inheritance in animal cells using four-dimensional fluorescence microscopy, serial section reconstruction of electron micrographs, and peroxidase cytochemistry to track {{the fate of a}} Golgi enzyme fused to horseradish peroxidase. All three approaches show that partitioning of Golgi membranes is mediated by Golgi clusters that persist throughout mitosis, together with shed vesicles that are often found associated with spindle microtubules. We have been unable to find evidence that Golgi membranes fuse during the later phases of mitosis with the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as a strategy for Golgi partitioning (Zaal, K. <b>J.,</b> <b>C.</b> <b>L.</b> Smith, R.

Furthermore, we show that accurate partitioning is accomplished early in mitosis, by a process of cytoplasmic redistribution of Golgi fragments and vesicles yielding a balance of Golgi membranes {{on either side of the}} metaphase plate before cell division...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Unfertilized eggs of the medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) were {{injected}} with pHbuffered calcium buffers. Medaka egg activation {{is accompanied by}} a transient increase in cytoplasmic free calcium (Gilkey, <b>J.</b> <b>C.,</b> <b>L.</b> F. Jaffe, E. B. Ridgway, and G. T. Reynolds, 1978, J. Cell Biol., 76 : 448 - 466). The calcium buffer injections demonstrated that (a) the threshold free calcium required to elicit the calcium transient and activate the egg is between 1. 7 and 5. 1 #M at pH 7. 0, well below the 30 ~M reached during the transient, and (b) buffers which hold free calcium below threshold prevent activation of the buffered region in subsequently fertilized eggs. Therefore an increase in free calcium is necessary and sufficient to elicit the calcium transient, and the calcium transient is necessary to activate the egg. Further, these results are additional proof that the calcium transient is initiated and propagated through the cytoplasm by a mechanism of calcium-stimulated calcium release. Finally, a normal calcium transient must propagate through the entire cytoplasm to ensure normal development. Unfertilized eggs were {{injected with}} pH buffers to produce short-term, localized changes in cytoplasmic pH. The eggs were then fertilized at various times after injection. In other experiments, unfertilized and fertilized eggs were exposed to media containing either NH 4 C...|$|E
