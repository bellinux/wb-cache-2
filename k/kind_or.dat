However, {{some researchers have}} noted that modern Komodo monitors sometimes kill each other when competing for access to carcasses. The lizards will then proceed to cannibalize the remains of their rivals, which may suggest similar behavior in Majungasaurus and other theropods.|$|E
5|$|Moreover, as the {{industrial}} revolution took hold and the prevalence of manual labour declined, there were increasing concerns that British men would become unfit and undisciplined; images of sport and combat were thought to motivate the viewer to aspire to an ideal of physical strength which people were worried was becoming lost. Wrestling and boxing thus were popular subjects for artworks, and Etty had produced other paintings and sketches of men engaged in fights of one <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another. It had become common for artists to use boxers and soldiers as models, as they had the strength and bearing considered desirable, and the discipline to hold a pose for long periods in the studio.|$|E

25|$|Further acclaim {{greeted the}} {{director}} in 1996 with Les voleurs (Thieves) (1996), an ambitious and complex crime drama. The film jumps through time and switches narrative perspectives in a Rashomon-style exploring family and amorous ties. It postulates a fatalistic world bound by family origins and intense romantic longings {{in which every}} character is trapped into becoming a thief of one <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another, emotionally as well as existentially. This film earned Téchiné nominations for the César and Golden Palme at Cannes, {{as well as a}} host of other honors.|$|E
25|$|Fairies are {{generally}} described as human in appearance and having magical powers. Diminutive fairies of one <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> another {{have been recorded}} for centuries, but occur alongside the human-sized beings; these have been depicted as {{ranging in size from}} very tiny up {{to the size of a}} human child. Even with these small fairies, however, their small size may be magically assumed rather than constant. Some fairies though normally quite small were able to dilate their figures to imitate humans. On Orkney they were described as short in stature, dressed in dark grey, and sometimes seen in armour.|$|E
50|$|In ontology, {{pluralism}} {{refers to}} different ways, <b>kinds,</b> <b>or</b> modes of being.

5000|$|There is, in any case, a {{difference}} in how we talk about types <b>or</b> <b>kinds.</b> We say that Socrates is a token of a type, or an instance of the natural kind, human being. But notice that we say instead that Socrates {{is a member of}} the class of human beings. We would not say that Socrates is a [...] "member" [...] of the type <b>or</b> <b>kind,</b> human beings. Nor would we say he is a type (<b>or</b> <b>kind)</b> of a class. He is a token (instance) of the type (kind). So the linguistic difference is: types (<b>or</b> <b>kinds)</b> have tokens (<b>or</b> instances); classes, on the other hand, have members.|$|R

25|$|Tsui's third film, Dangerous Encounter of the First Kind (1980), put him {{beyond the}} pale. The thriller about delinquent youths on a bombing spree was nihilistic, grisly and {{pregnant}} with angry political subtext. Heavily censored by the British colonial government, {{it was released}} in 1981 in a drastically altered version titled Dangerous Encounter – 1st <b>Kind</b> (<b>or</b> alternatively, Don't Play with Fire). Unsurprisingly, {{it was not a}} financial success. However, it helped to make Tsui a darling of film critics who had coined the New Wave label and were hopeful for a more aesthetically daring cinema, more engaged with the realities of contemporary Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|Although modern {{dictionaries}} may {{refer to}} Apis as either honey bee or honeybee, entomologist Robert Snodgrass asserts that correct usage requires two words, i.e. honey bee, {{as it is}} a <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> type of bee, whereas it is incorrect to run the two words together as in dragonfly or butterfly, because the latter are not flies. Honey bee, not honeybee, is the listed common name in the Integrated Taxonomic Information System, the Entomological Society of America Common Names of Insects Database, and the Tree of Life Web Project. Nonetheless, compounds gradually solidify in the orthography of natural languages in ways that do not always comply with prescription.|$|E
25|$|Native Americans {{determined}} {{the fate of}} European explorers and settlers depending on whether a tribe was <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> warlike. Friendly tribes taught newcomers how to grow indigenous crops, prepare foods, and hunting methods for the wild game. Warlike tribes made life difficult and dangerous for explorers and settlers through their attacks and resistance to European conquest. Many Native Americans died of new infectious diseases, which caused high fatalities and disrupted their cultures {{in the early years}} of colonization. In the 19th century, they resisted European and American expansion, and there was frequent warfare. After the American Civil War, the United States Army was used to suppress resistance in the Indian Wars.|$|E

50|$|In ontology, the {{different}} <b>kinds</b> <b>or</b> {{ways of being}} are called categories of being or simply categories.

25|$|The feudal {{duties of}} the peasant were not {{the same for all}} the Albanian areas but {{differed}} according to the terrain. The systems of payment in <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> in cash also changed accordingly, but the strengthening of the nobility against the central authority in the 13th century caused the payments in cash to increase compared to payments in kind. From the 12th to the 14th century, the vertical shift of power to the nobles was deepened. Not only were the plains brought {{under the control of the}} nobles, but also mountainous areas. The feudal possessions also began to include communal areas such as forests, pastures, and fisheries. This evolution took place during the period of Byzantine decline and saw the conversion of the pronoia into an estate very similar to the feudal one.|$|E
25|$|Circumcision is an {{important}} ritual among the Tanala, {{as in many other}} Malagasy ethnic groups. A range of fady are associated with the practice, particularly for nobles. A noble Tanala mother became subject to a new range of fady after the circumcision of her son. She was thereafter forbidden to take her son for a walk, eat on her own bed or in secret, or consume dried meat of any <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> the meat of a zebu that had been slaughtered (as opposed to having died of natural causes). If she broke any of these taboos, or if the child urinated or defecated during the circumcision ceremony, the child would lose his noble status (an older fady previously required that the child be put to death in such cases).|$|E
25|$|This poem {{is a clear}} {{description}} of Martí’s societal hopes for his homeland. Within the poem, he talks about how regardless of the person, whether <b>kind</b> <b>or</b> cruel he cultivates a white rose, meaning that he remains peaceful. This coincides with his ideology about establishing unity amongst the people, more so those of Cuba, through a common identity, with no regards to ethnic and racial differences. This doctrine could be accomplished if one treated his enemy with peace as he would treat a friend. The kindness of one person should be shared with all people, regardless of personal conflict. By following the moral that lies within “Cultivo Rosa Blanca”, Martí’s vision of Cuban solidarity could be possible, creating a more peaceful society that would emanate through future generations.|$|E
