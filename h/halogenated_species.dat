Most of these compounds are environmental contaminants, thus much of the NCI analysis that takes place is done {{under the auspices of}} environmental analysis.

50|$|The {{first step}} in the {{biosynthesis}} of griseofulvin by P. griseofulvin is the synthesis of the 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain by a type I iterative polyketide synthase (PKS) via iterative addition of 6 malonyl-CoA to an acyl-CoA starter unit. The 14-carbon poly-β-keto chain undergoes cyclization/aromatization, using cyclase/aromatase, respectively, through a Claisen and aldol condensation to form the benzophenone intermediate. The benzophenone intermediate is then methylated via S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) twice to yield griseophenone C. The griseophenone C is then halogenated at the activated site ortho to the phenol group on the left aromatic ring to form griseophenone B. The <b>halogenated</b> <b>species</b> then undergoes a single phenolic oxidation in both rings forming the two oxygen diradical species. The right oxygen radical shifts alpha to the carbonyl via resonance allowing for a stereospecific radical coupling by the oxygen radical on the left ring forming a tetrahydrofuranone species. The newly formed grisan skeleton with a spiro center is then O-methylated by SAM to generate dehydrogriseofulvin. Ultimately, a stereoselective reduction of the olefin on dehydrogriseofulvin by NADPH affords griseofulvin.|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) dyes was tested as photosensitisers for light-driven {{hydrogen}} evolution {{in combination with}} the complex [Pd(PPh 3) Cl 2] 2 as a source for catalytically-active Pd nanoparticles and triethylamine as a sacrificial electron donor. In line with earlier reports, halogenated dyes showed significantly higher hydrogen production activity. All BODIPYs were fully characterised using stationary absorption and emission spectroscopy. Time-resolved spectroscopic investigations on meso-mesityl substituted compounds revealed that reduction of the photo-excited BODIPY by the sacrificial agent occurs from an excited singlet state, while, in <b>halogenated</b> <b>species,</b> long-lived triplet states are present, determining electron transfer processes from the sacrificial agent. Quantum chemical calculations performed at the time-dependent density functional level of theory indicate that the differences in the photocatalytic performance of the present series of dyes can be correlated to the varying efficiency of intersystem crossing in non-halogenated and <b>halogenated</b> <b>species</b> and not to alterations in the energy levels introduced upon substitution...|$|E

40|$|The {{myeloperoxidase}} {{system of}} neutrophils uses hydrogen peroxide and chloride to generate hypochlorous acid, a potent bactericidal oxidant in vitro. In a mouse model of polymicrobial sepsis, we observed that mice deficient in myeloperoxidase {{were more likely}} than wild-type mice to die from infection. Mass spectrometric analysis of peritoneal inflammatory fluid from septic wild-type mice detected elevated concentrations of 3 -chlorotyrosine, a characteristic end product of the myeloperoxidase system. Levels of 3 -chlorotyrosine did not rise in the septic myeloperoxidase-deficient mice. Thus, myeloperoxidase seems to protect against sepsis in vivo by producing <b>halogenating</b> <b>species.</b> Surprisingly, levels of 3 -bromotyrosine also were elevated in peritoneal fluid from septic wild-type mice and were markedly reduced in peritoneal fluid from septic myeloperoxidase-deficient mice. Furthermore, physiologic concentrations of bromide modulated the bactericidal effects of myeloperoxidase in vitro. It seems, therefore, that myeloperoxidase can use bromide as well as chloride to produce oxidants in vivo, even though the extracellular concentration of bromide is at least 1, 000 -fold lower than that of chloride. Thus, myeloperoxidase {{plays an important role in}} host defense against bacterial pathogens, and bromide might be a previously unsuspected component of this system...|$|R
40|$|<b>Halogenated</b> <b>species</b> have a {{significant}} impact on atmospheric composition, including catalytic ozone destruction and influence on HOx and NOx cycles. Halogens are also involved in marine and coastal new particle formation, a process that can ultimately affect Earth's radiation balance. However, the exact processes governing halogen chemistry and halogen new particle formation have been puzzling the community for years. One of the major difficulties in understanding these processes has been the lack of techniques able to measure inorganic halogenated radicals and stable species simultaneously both in laboratory studies and in ambient conditions. This is because previous spectroscopic and mass spectrometric methods utilized could only measure one, or a few <b>halogenated</b> <b>species</b> at once, while most of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>species</b> existing in the atmosphere were likely un-measurable. Here we present new chemical ionization (CI) mass spectrometric methods to measure over 20 <b>halogenated</b> <b>species</b> simultaneously at ambient pressure. These species include halogen oxides, halogen acids, nitrogen containing halogen species, halogen radicals and molecular halogens, covering the major categories present in the ambient atmosphere. The methods will further be deployed into field measurements in various locations around the world to better understand the impact of <b>halogenated</b> <b>species</b> to the atmosphere. A recent study revealed homogeneous nucleation processes by (HIO 3) (brackets here indicate all the isomers). However, the exact formation mechanism of (HIO 3) has not been investigated in laboratory experiments. We deployed the above mentioned new measurements methods to study the formation mechanism of (HIO 3) in dedicated flow tube experiments. The results show that OIO and OH radical could form (HIO 3) as indicated by previous quantum mechanism calculations. In addition, two novel (HIO 3) formation pathways from photo-oxidation of CH 2 I 2 and molecular iodine were suggested. One pathway shows that the homogeneous bimolecular reaction of CH 2 IOO could form (HIO 3), while the other suggests either iodine radical or iodine monoxide could react with ozone and water vapor to form (HIO 3). These findings could potentially explain the large amount of (HIO 3) observed. Beside from coastal areas, the first ambient data showing the existence of (HIO 3) in various locations in the world, including a boreal forest site, a wet land site, Greenland and Antarctica are also presented here. These findings indicate that the (HIO 3) might be involved in nucleation processes in locations other than coastal areas. More than (HIO 3), sulfuric acid is known for its active role in atmospheric nucleation over different environments. However, the knowledge of its gas phase oxidation processes is not complete. Our laboratory results imply that iodinated species might be able to oxidize SO 2 to sulfuric acid through some yet unknown mechanisms. Further studies are needed to understand the exact mechanisms in the oxidation processes and how important this mechanism could be in the ambient atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|Most of the {{short-lived}} biogenic and anthropogenic chemical {{species that are}} emitted into the atmosphere break down efficiently by reaction with OH and do not reach the stratosphere. Here we show {{the existence of a}} pronounced minimum in the tropospheric column of ozone over the West Pacific, the main source region for stratospheric air, and suggest a corresponding minimum of the tropospheric column of OH. This has the potential to amplify the impact of surface emissions on the stratospheric composition compared to the impact when assuming globally uniform OH conditions. Specifically, the role of emissions of biogenic <b>halogenated</b> <b>species</b> for the stratospheric halogen budget and the role of increasing emissions of SO 2 in Southeast Asia or from minor volcanic eruptions for the increasing stratospheric aerosol loading need to be reassessed in light of these findings. This is also important since climate change will further modify OH abundances and emissions of <b>halogenated</b> <b>species.</b> Our study is based on ozone sonde measurements carried out during the TransBrom cruise with the RV Sonne roughly along 140 – 150 ° E in October 2009 and corroborating ozone and OH measurements from satellites, aircraft campaigns and FTIR instruments. Model calculations with the GEOS-Chem Chemistry and Transport Model (CTM) and the ATLAS CTM are used to simulate the tropospheric OH distribution over the West Pacific and the transport pathways to the stratosphere.

The formation of 8 -halo-dGs with other oxidative stress biomarkers in lipopolysaccharide-treated rats was assessed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and immunohistochemistry using a novel monoclonal antibody (mAb 8 B 3) to 8 -BrdG-conjugated keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The antibody recognized both 8 -BrdG and 8 -CldG. In the liver of lipopolysaccharide-treated rats, immunostaining for 8 -halo-dGs, halogenated tyrosines, and MPO were increased at 8 h, whereas those of 8 -oxo- 2 ′-dG (8 -OxodG) and 3 -nitrotyrosine were increased at 24 h. Urinary excretion of both 8 -CldG and 8 -BrdG was also observed earlier than those of 8 -OxodG and modified tyrosines (3 -nitrotyrosine, 3 -chlorotyrosine, and 3 - bromotyrosine). Moreover, the levels of the 8 -halo-dGs in urine from human diabetic patients were 8 -fold higher than in healthy subjects (n = 10, healthy and diabetic, p < 0. 0001), whereas there was a moderate difference in 8 -OxodG between the two groups (p < 0. 001). Interestingly, positive mAb 8 B 3 antibody staining was observed in liver tissue from hepatocellular carcinoma patients but not in liver tissue from human cirrhosis patients.

When VSL halogen sources are neglected, future UV ERY increases due to declines in ozone column are nearly balanced by reductions of UV ERY due to scattering by the higher stratospheric aerosol burden in mid-latitudes. Consideration of VSL sources at their upper limit tips the balance, resulting in annual average increases in UV ERY of up to 5 % in mid and high latitudes.

5000|$|From all LRP methods, Atom {{transfer}} {{radical polymerization}} or ATRP {{is the most}} studied and since its development in 1995 an exhaustive amount of articles has been published about this topic. An excellent review written by the pioneer in the field, Matyjaszewski, covers the developments in ATRP from 1995 {{until the end of}} 2000. Atom transfer radical polymerization or ATRP involves the chain initiation of free radical polymerization by a <b>halogenated</b> organic <b>species</b> {{in the presence of a}} metal halide. The metal has a number of different oxidation states that allows it to abstract a halide from the organohalide, creating a radical that then starts free radical polymerization. After inititation and propagation, the radical on the active chain terminus is reversibly terminated (with the halide) by reacting with the catalyst in its higher oxidation state. Thus, the redox process gives rise to an equilibrium between dormant (Polymer-Halide) and active (Polymer-radical) chains. The equilibrium is designed to heavily favor the dormant state, which effectively reduces the radical concentration to a sufficiently low level to limit bimolecular coupling.|$|R

A transient 1960 – 2100 simulation is analysed which follows the representative concentration pathway 6. 0 (RCP 6. 0) emissions scenario for the future. Tropical averaged (10 ° S– 10 ° N) TCO 3 values decrease from the 1970 s, reach a minimum around 2000 and return to their 1980 values around 2040, consistent with the use and emission of halogenated ozone-depleting substances (ODSs), and their later controls under the Montreal Protocol.

Mechanistically, ATRP is based on the reversibile halogen atom transfer between a low oxidation state metal complex, [MtL]z+ and a dormant <b>halogenated</b> macromolecular <b>species</b> (Pn-X), resulting in the formation of a propagating radical (Pn•) and the metal complex in a higher oxidation state. The process is initiated by a radical generating reaction between [MtL]z+ and an alkyl halide, RX, resembling the monomer. The success of ATRP depends strongly on the appropriate equilibrium between activation/deactivation steps. In addition, electron transfer between the metal catalyst and the propagating radical should be very slow to avoid chain termination. Therefore, knowledge on the redox properties of alkyl radicals is highly desired. Another important issue, which has recently become a matter of some controversy [2], is the mechanism of the activation reaction in which reductive cleavage of a C-X bond occurs. Herein we report the results of a study on the mechanism of homogeneous dissociative ET to some alkyl halides (XCH 2 CN, XCH 2 CO 2 Et, XCH(CH 3) CO 2 CH 3, where X = Cl, Br, I), which are frequently used as initiators in ATRP. The kinetics of the homogeneous ET between electrogenerated aromatic or heteroaromatic radical anions, D•-, and RX has been analyzed in CH 3 CN. All compounds undergo a concerted dissociative electron transfer with formation of a fragment cluster in the solvent cage; that is the reaction dynamics is best described by the sticky dissciative ET model. The reaction between RX and D•- leads to a radical R•, which can react with D•- either by radical coupling (kc) or by electron transfer (ket). Examination of the competition between these reactions, which can be expressed by a dimensionless parameter q = ket/(ket + kc), as a function of EoD/D•- allows estimation of the reduction potentials of the intermediate radicals [3]. The standard reduction potentials obtained for the three radicals •CH 2 CN, •CH 2 CO 2 Et, •CH(CH 3) CO 2 CH 3 lie in the range from - 0. 54 to - 0. 71 V vs. SCE...|$|R
40|$|Background: Myeloperoxidase (MPO) is {{a member}} of the peroxidase- {{cyclooxygenase}} superfamily, which is secreted from stimulated leucocytes at inflammatory sites. It is well known that MPO catalyses oxidation reactions via the release of reactive <b>halogenating</b> and nitrating <b>species</b> and thus induces tissue damage. Several studies have already implicated MPO in the development of neoplasia. Chronic or recurrent prostatic inflammation has long been recognized as having the potential to initiate and promote the development of prostate cancer. The objective was to investigate whether MPO is present in the prostate. METHODS Human prostate material was obtained from biopsies, transurethral resections of the prostate (TURP), prostatic adenomectomies, and retropubic radical prostatectomies. Twenty-nine slides of normal prostate tissue, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and prostate cancer were reviewed by a pathologist. Immunohistochemical analysis using MPO-specific human antibody was performed to detect MPO in the prostate tissue. Results: Immunocytohistochemistry showed cellular colocalization of MPO in the secretory epithelial cells of the prostate with staining varying from light to strong intensity. Staining in the glandular apical snouts was often reinforced although staining of basal as well as of luminal glandular cells was also present. Conclusions: We identified, for the first time, the presence of MPO at the surface of prostatic epithelial cells. In view of the pro-oxidant properties of this enzyme, further research is needed to define whether MPO contributes to the development of prostatic lesions. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals,Inc.

40|$|A {{wide array}} of {{volatile}} organic compound (VOC) measurements was conducted in the Valley of Mexico during the MCMA- 2002 and 2003 field campaigns. Study sites included locations in the urban core, in a heavily industrial area and at boundary sites in rural landscapes. In addition, a novel mobile-laboratory-based conditional sampling method was used to collect samples dominated by fresh on-road vehicle exhaust to identify those VOCs whose ambient concentrations were primarily due to vehicle emissions. Four distinct analytical techniques were used: whole air canister samples with Gas Chromatography/Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID), on-line chemical ionization using a Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometer (PTR-MS), continuous real-time detection of olefins using a Fast Olefin Sensor (FOS), and long path measurements using UV Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometers (DOAS). The simultaneous use of these techniques provided {{a wide range of}} individual VOC measurements with different spatial and temporal scales. The VOC data were analyzed to understand concentration and spatial distributions, diurnal patterns, origin and reactivity in the atmosphere of Mexico City. The VOC burden (in ppbC) was dominated by alkanes (60 %), followed by aromatics (15 %) and olefins (5 %). The remaining 20 % was a mix of alkynes, <b>halogenated</b> hydrocarbons, oxygenated <b>species</b> (esters, ethers, etc.) and other unidentified VOCs. However, in terms of ozone production, olefins were the most relevant hydrocarbons. Elevated levels of toxic hydrocarbons, such as 1, 3 -butadiene, benzene, toluene and xylenes, were also observed. Results from these various analytical techniques showed that vehicle exhaust is the main source of VOCs in Mexico City and that diurnal patterns depend on vehicular traffic in addition to meteorological processes. Finally, examination of the VOC data in terms of lumped modeling VOC classes and its comparison to the VOC lumped emissions reported in other photochemical air quality modeling studies suggests that some alkanes are underestimated in the emissions inventory, while some olefins and aromatics are overestimated...|$|R

Whole air samples were obtained on board research flights that flew over California during June 2008 and analyzed for selected volatile organic compounds, including several <b>halogenated</b> <b>species.</b> Samples collected over the South Coast Air Basin of California (SoCAB), which includes much of Los Angeles (LA) County, were compared with samples from inflow air masses over the Pacific Ocean. The levels of many halocarbon species were enhanced significantly over the SoCAB, including compounds regulated by the Montreal Protocol and subsequent amendments (e. g., enhancements of 13 pptv and 11 pptv for CFC- 11 and CFC- 12, respectively). Emissions estimates of HFC- 152 a (0. 98 &plusmn; 0. 05 Gg) and HFC- 134 a (1. 40 &plusmn; 0. 11 Gg) in LA County for 2008 were obtained using the observed HFC:CO enhancement ratio. The emission rates were extrapolated to the SoCAB (1. 48 &plusmn; 0. 07 Gg for HFC- 152 a and 2. 12 &plusmn; 0. 17 Gg for HFC- 134 a) and US (30. 1 &plusmn; 1. 5 Gg for HFC- 152 a and 43. 0 &plusmn; 3. 4 Gg for HFC- 134 a) using population data. In addition, emission rates of the two HFCs in LA County and SoCAB also were calculated by a second method that utilizes air quality modeling. Estimates obtained using both methods agree well...|$|E
40|$|The oceans {{are a key}} {{source of}} a number of atmospherically {{important}} volatile gases. The accurate and robust determination of trace gases in seawater is a significant analytical challenge, requiring reproducible and ideally automated sample handling, a high efficiency of seawater–air transfer, removal of water vapour from the sample stream, and high sensitivity and selectivity of the analysis. Here we describe a system that was developed for the fully automated analysis of dissolved very short-lived <b>halogenated</b> <b>species</b> (VSLS) sampled from an under-way seawater supply. The system can also be used for semi-automated batch sampling from Niskin bottles filled during CTD (conductivity, temperature, depth) profiles. The essential components comprise a bespoke, automated purge and trap (AutoP & T) unit coupled to a commercial thermal desorption and gas chromatograph mass spectrometer (TD-GC-MS). The AutoP & T system has completed five research cruises, from the tropics to the poles, and collected over 2500 oceanic samples to date. It is able to quantify > 25 species over a boiling point range of 34 – 180 °C with Henry's law coefficients of 0. 018 and greater (CH 2 2 l, k H cc dimensionless gas/aqueous) and has been used to measure organic sulfurs, hydrocarbons, halocarbons and terpenes. In the eastern tropical Pacific, the high sensitivity and sampling frequency provided new information regarding the distribution of VSLS, including novel measurements of a photolytically driven diurnal cycle of CH 2 2 l within the surface ocean water...|$|E
40|$|The Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier {{transform}} spectrometer (ACE-FTS), onboard the SCISAT- 1 satellite, is a high-resolution (0. 02 cm− 1) instrument {{covering the}} 750 - 4400 cm− 1 spectral region in solar occultation mode. Launched in August 2003, the ACE-FTS {{has been taking}} atmospheric measurements for over ten years. With long atmospheric pathlengths (∼ 300 km) and the sun as a radiation source, the ACE-FTS provides a low detection threshold for trace species in the atmosphere. In fact, it measures the vertical profiles of more molecules in the atmosphere than any other satellite instrument. Fluorine- and chlorine-containing molecules in the atmosphere are very strong greenhouse gases, meaning that even small amounts of these gases contribute significantly to the radiative forcing of climate. Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) are regulated by the 1987 Montreal Protocol because they deplete the ozone layer. Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which do not deplete the ozone layer and are not regulated by the Montreal Protocol, have been introduced as replacements for CFCs and HCFCs. HFCs have global-warming potentials many times greater than carbon dioxide, and are increasing in the atmosphere at a very fast rate. The quantification of the atmospheric abundances of such molecules from measurements taken by the ACE-FTS and other satellite instruments crucially requires accurate quantitative infrared spectroscopy. HITRAN contains absorption cross section datasets {{for a number of}} these species, but many of them have minor deficiencies that introduce systematic errors into satellite retrievals.

40|$|The {{principles}} and experimental techniques of {{electron spin resonance}} (esr) are outlined in the early chapters. A general investigation of low spin cobalt (II) complexes, in Chapter 3, indicates how the esr parameters are related to electronic and molecular structure. In Chapter 4, a solid state esr study of the paramagnetic pentacyanocobaltate (II) ion, in various alkali metal halide hosts, confirms a(dz,) 1 configuration for this d 7 ion and mixing of 4 s atomic orbital is invoked to explain the esr data. The extent of mixing of 4 s orbitals is also estimated for other low spin cobalt (II) complexes. In this study, some new halogenated cobaltous complexes were formed by thermal substitution of lattice halide ions. In {{the second half of}} the chapter, an investigation of the paramagnetic adduct of the pentacyanocobaltate (II) ion and phenyl nitroxide involved both liquid and solid state analyses. A novel method for linking data for the two phases is utilised to allow analysis of the complex powder spectra. The results are used to discuss the bonding in the molecule. In Chapter 5 the paramagnetic species to be discussed are produced by 8 -irradiation. Several d 6 transition metal complex cyanides are irradiated and d 7 species showing nitrogen hyperfine structure are observed. This hyperfine structure is shown to arise from a "bent" cyanide ligand, rather than an inverted cyanide (isocyanide) ligand as previously thought. The discovery of many more <b>halogenated</b> d 7 <b>species</b> led to an analysis of the electronic structure of these complexes and the differences in spin density distribution in the 3 d and 4 d series are discussed. An esr study of the hexanitritocobaltate (II) ion is reported in Chapter 6. The magnitude of the hyperfine couplings to cobalt and nitrogen are discussed and the radiation damage of the hexanitritocobaltate (II) ion is interpreted in relation to the damage of the analagous hexacyanide complex...|$|R
40|$|Bromoform {{is one of}} {{the main}} sources of <b>halogenated</b> Very Short-Lived <b>Species</b> (VSLS) that {{possibly}} contributes when degradated to the inorganic halogen loading in the stratosphere. Because of its short lifetime of about four weeks, its pathway to the stratosphere is mainly the transport by convection up to the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and then by radiative ascent in the low stratosphere. Some of its degradation product gases (PGs) that are soluble can be scavenged and not reach the TTL. In this paper we present a detailed modelling study of the transport and the degradation of bromoform and its PGs in convection. We use a 3 -D-cloud resolving model coupled with a chemistry model including gaseous and aqueous chemistry. We run idealised simulations up to 10 days, initialised using a tropical radiosounding for atmospheric conditions and using outputs from a global chemistry-transport model for chemical species. Bromoform is initialised only in the low levels. The first simulation is run with stable atmospheric conditions. It shows that the sum of the bromoform and its PGs significantly decreases with time because of dry deposition and that PGs are mainly in the form of HBr after 2 days of simulation. The other simulation is similar to the first simulation but includes perturbations of temperature and of moisture leading to the development of a convective cloud reaching the TTL. Results of this simulation show an efficient vertical transport of the bromoform from the boundary layer in the upper troposphere and TTL (mixing ratio up to 45 % of the initial boundary layer mixing ratio). The organic PGs, which are for the most abundant of them not very soluble, are also uplifted efficiently. For the inorganic PGs, which are more abundant than organic PGs, their mixing ratios in the upper troposphere and in the TTL depend on the partitioning between inorganic soluble and inorganic non soluble species in the convective cloud. Important soluble species such as HBr and HOBr are efficiently scavenged by rain. This removal is reduced by the production of Br 2 (not soluble) in the gas phase from aqueous processes in the cloud droplets. This Br 2 production process is therefore important for the PG budget in the upper troposphere and in the TTL. We also showed that this process is favoured by acidic conditions in the coud droplets, i. e. polluted conditions...|$|R
40|$|Summary In this work, {{several aspects}} around {{headspace}} (HS) sampling and detection hyphenated with gas chromatography (GC) were covered. Regarding HS sampling, {{the results of}} three studies were reported around the problems encountered with the analysis of aqueous samples and/or high boiling analytes with a high affinity for the matrix in chapters 2 to 4 in this manuscript, whilst the final chapter covers the development and characterization of a novel GC detector. In chapter 2, {{the use of the}} full evaporation technique (FET) for the analysis of high boiling analytes with a high affinity for apolar matrices was evaluated and compared with the conventional static HS (sHS) sampling approach. A FET method has been developed and validated for the analysis of typical high boiling analytes (bp. > 200 °C) including camphor, menthol, methyl salicylate and ethyl salicylate that are often used in various topical formulations. Data have shown that FET is an excellent approach to circumvent matrix effects that are often encountered with sHS methods. The method showed excellent recovery and repeatability during validation and was finally applied on commercial formulations such as Radosalil , ThermoCream , Vicks Vaporub  and Reflexspray . In chapter 3, acetone acetals were employed as water scavengers for the analysis of aqueous samples using HS-GC. After optimization of the scavenging reaction conditions, the approach was used for FET analysis of various typical high boiling polar residual solvents that are miscible with water. The procedure enabled sample enrichment which provided a significant gain in sensitivity of the FET analysis of these analytes and it was finally applied on a cefotaxime sample for the quantification of residual N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). During experiments it was revealed that the same procedure can be used for the quantitative derivatization of ethylene glycol (EG) in aqueous samples. The formation of the significantly more volatile 2, 2 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -dioxolane (2, 2 -DD) enabled determining EG using sHS sampling. In chapter 4, a novel HS approach for the analysis of quaternary ammonium salts (QAS) in aqueous samples is presented in which the reported water scavenging method from chapter 3 is used for the removal of water and sample enrichment. Screening experiments revealed that QAS substituted with benzyl and methyl groups degrade to form benzyl chloride and chloromethane under the used experimental conditions. By using chloromethane and benzyl chloride for quantification of such QAS, matching calibration standards are not needed. This means that one kind can be used for the determination of other QAS that also yield chloromethane and benzyl chloride as reaction products. The methodology was used for the analysis of denatonium benzoate (DB) in EG based cooling liquids and the analysis of benzoxonium chloride (BZOCL) or benzethonium chloride (BZTCl) in mouth sprays. Finally in chapter 5, work around the development and characterization of a novel GC detector is presented. The detector used a micro cavity hollow cathode discharge (µCHCD) plasma as ion source combined with an either positively or negatively biased capture electrode. Typical advantages of the used low power µCHCD are the increased ionization efficiency compared to the hydrogen flame used in the flame ionization detector (FID) and operation at atmospheric pressure without the need for additional gasses. During development of the µCHCD ion source {{it was found that the}} detector geometry was of great influence on the obtained signal. By adapting to a geometry with a wide anode clearance angle, a sensitive response in the pg range was obtained for various analytes including carbon tetrachloride (CCl 4) which is poorly detected with the FID. It was noticed that halogenated analytes were possibly subjected to a different ionization mechanism than the non-halogenated <b>species.</b> <b>Halogenated</b> ones most likely form negative ions in the electron rich plasma as these were most efficiently detected by a positively biased capture electrode. status: publishe...|$|R
