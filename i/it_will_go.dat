5|$|Walsh {{identified}} drinks as {{the central}} Diageo business, and began selling off assets that did not fit this model. He sold Pillsbury to General Mills in 2001 for $10.1 billion, and Burger King to the private equity firm Texas Pacific Group in 2002 for $1.5 billion. He suggested {{that he would have}} liked to have sold Burger King earlier, but was worried about Diageo's capacity to handle both transactions simultaneously. In a strategy to bolster Diageo's drinks sales, in 2001 he acquired the Seagram drinks business from Vivendi Universal in conjunction with Pernod Ricard for $8.2 billion, an action that was later credited with refocusing and re-energising Diageo. At the time, analysts suggested that Walsh had overpaid, and that Pernod Ricard had gained control of the better brands. Despite having entered into an alliance with Pernod in order to avoid regulatory issues, Diageo was still forced to divest the Malibu Rum brand after acquiring Captain Morgan. Walsh defended the deal on the basis of efficiency savings and the fact that the deal was almost entirely financed by the sale of Pillsbury. Of the acquisition he says:We moved in on that Seagram deal and forced their hand very quickly while our competitors were still trying to get their act together. If you look at what we paid <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> down in history as the bargain of the century. It was an $8.1bn total price of which our part was about $5.6bn and it was at economic profit break even at the end of year two. It’s produced phenomenal returns. If you look at Pernod’s Allied Domecq acquisition, it is 30 per cent higher in multiple terms and you’re not getting as good a collection of brands.|$|E

25|$|Construction was {{authorized}} on July 24, 2011, before advanced planning had been completed. The project will cost NIS 1.95 billion {{and will be}} funded partly by real estate revenue from selling the Eilat Airport's land. The planning budget, approved on May6, 2010, is NIS 56million. There was a plan to make the airport a build-operate-transfer (BOT) project, but the Israel Airports Authority (IAA) objected, and the government authorized it to plan and oversee the project. Despite this, {{it is estimated that}} if the IAA takes on the funding completely on its own, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> bankrupt and default on its debts. Danya Cebus will build the passenger terminal. The terminal is set to feature a duty-free shop, a feature which was not present in Eilat Airport. Mer Group will provide command and control for the airport, including CCTV and perimeter protection.|$|E

25|$|Because the {{misfeasance}} provision reflects {{causes of}} action vested in the company, any money recovered under it is held so that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> {{to pay off}} creditors in their ordinary order of priority. In Re Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union this meant that a liquidator who had successfully sued directors for £7000 {{had to give up}} the funds to a group of debenture holders, who had not yet been paid in full, so there is no discretion to apply the assets in favour of unsecured creditors. A potential benefit is that because the causes of action are vested in the company, they may be assigned to third parties, who may prefer to take the risk and reward of pursuing litigation over the liquidator or administrator. These features are the reverse for money recovered through the statutory based causes of action of fraudulent and wrongful trading.|$|E
25|$|However, {{it seems}} that a {{southern}} portion will now be built as the Scottish Executive has determined that the M74 motorway will be extended through the Southeast of Glasgow {{to connect with the}} Kingston Bridge (although not along the original route identified in the Bruce Report). This is a controversial plan as it involves plowing the motorway through the city, something that many residents do not want, and a public enquiry recommended that construction not proceed. However the Executive contends that the economic benefits as well as congestion on the current motorway dictate that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> ahead. Despite this, the opposers to the scheme mounted a legal challenge in June 2005, which will probably mean that opening of the extension will be delayed until 2009 at the earliest. The City Council have indicated that should this extension be complete they will reconsider building the eastern flank of the ring road which will necessitate either a second motorway bridge over the river, or a tunnel.|$|E
25|$|Spice Planet is an {{alternate}} Dune story written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson {{based upon the}} original story outline that Frank Herbert made for Dune. It features House Linkam (a version of House Atreides) temporarily taking control of Duneworld from their rivals, House Hoskanner (the forerunner of the Harkonnens), to settle a dispute between them. The Hoskanners had received a monopoly concession on the recently discovered Duneworld, but as melange had grown in popularity in the Empire, other Houses had begun to dislike the Hoskanner's wealth and pushed House Linkam to challenge House Hoskanner. The Emperor, secretly allied with the Hoskanners, orders Linkam to take over Duneworld for two years with the promise that if they produce more melange, then they will receive the concession — else <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> permanently to the Hoskanners. Much like in Dune, the Hoskanners sabotage and thwart {{to the best of}} their abilities, although the Linkams enlist the help of the Imperial Planetologist to devise a way to neutralize the sandworms and vastly increase the efficiency of operations.|$|E

25|$|In chapter 96, a myth {{explaining}} Skíðblaðnirs {{creation is}} provided. The chapter details that the god Loki once {{cut off the}} goddess's Sif's hair {{in an act of}} mischief. Sif's husband, Thor, enraged, found Loki, caught hold of him, and threatened to break every last bone in his body. Loki promises to have the Svartálfar make Sif a new head of hair that will grow just as any other. Loki goes to the dwarfs known as Ivaldi's sons, and they made not only Sif a new head of gold hair but also Skíðblaðnir and the spear Gungnir. As the tale continues, Loki risks his neck for the creation of the devastating hammer Mjöllnir, the multiplying ring Draupnir, and the speedy, sky-and-water traveling, bright-bristled boar Gullinbursti. In the end, Loki's wit saves him his head, but results in the stitching together of his lips. The newly created items are doled out by the dwarfs to Sif, Thor, Odin, and Freyr. Freyr is gifted both Gullinbursti and Skíðblaðnir, the latter of which is again said to receive fair wind whenever its sail was set, and that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> wherever it needs to, and that it can be folded up much as cloth and placed in one's pocket at will.|$|E
25|$|Golf follows {{traditional}} golf rules: players {{must reach}} the {{hole on the}} green in as few strokes as possible by hitting the ball with a club, while avoiding obstacles including sand traps, water hazards, trees, and deep rough grass. In the screen's top left and right corners, players are shown the wind speed/direction and an aerial layout of the course, respectively. In advance of their turn, players choose aspects of the swing, such as speed, direction, stance, club type, swing power, and the ball impact point. Swing power requires players to stop an indicator {{at the right moment}} on a vertical arrow; the ball impact point requires players to stop a zig-zagging indicator as it moves down and then up a close-up of the ball. If players allow the indicator to move {{all the way up the}} vertical arrow, they will be given another chance to time their shot; if they allow the zig-zagging indicator to reach the top, the game will automatically stop it at the very top. If players hit the top of the ball, <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> further while hitting the bottom of the ball will cause the ball to go further but have a more controlled direction. Hitting the ball on the right or left sides will cause the ball to hook in either direction. The ideal spot is the center of the ball; unlike real golf, players do not need to hit the bottom of the ball when in bunkers or deep rough. Players can also place a grid on a nearby portion of the course to aide with the aim and distance of their shots. Players can choose between five different viewing perspectives, change button configurations, and review the positives and negatives of their last shots.|$|E
