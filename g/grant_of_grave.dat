40|$|Prehistoric barrow cemeteries {{are often}} {{structured}} in spatially separated groups. The formation {{of these groups}} was probably caused by a membership of the deceased to particular social units that were buried separately. We test the hypothesis that these groups of Early- and Middle Bronze Age <b>graves</b> represent cemeteries <b>of</b> individual families. We used GIS tools, statistical tests, principal component analysis (PCA) and network analysis carried out using Pajek software to test this hypothesis. This study {{is based on the}} assumption that the family cemeteries consist <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> <b>of</b> individuals who had different social status. Our assumption is that the family cemeteries are presented as separated groups <b>of</b> <b>graves.</b> Graves belonging to one group should therefore have different formal properties. Comparing formal and spatial characteristics within the studied cemeteries, some groups <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> were identified; these consist <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> with different burial assemblages. Our conclusion is that this finding supports the hypothesis that the spatially separated groups <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> represent cemeteries belonging to different families. </span...|$|R

50|$|All {{of these}} issues tend to put {{pressure}} on the re-use <b>of</b> <b>grave</b> sites within cemeteries. The re-use <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> already used for burial can cause considerable upset to family members. Although the authorities might declare that the grave is sufficiently old {{that there will be no}} human remains still present, nonetheless many people regard the re-use <b>of</b> <b>graves</b> (particularly their family's graves) as a desecration. Also re-use <b>of</b> a used <b>grave</b> involves the removal of any monuments and headstones, which may cause further distress to families (although families will typically be allowed to take away the monuments and headstones if they wish).|$|R
