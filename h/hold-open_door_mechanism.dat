40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} on {{determining}} the dead {{zone of the}} bottom <b>door</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed in the premise of considering the friction. This method can ensure the bottom doors of the railway cars with the self-unloading coal hoppers to realize the prescriptive mechanical action accurately, timely, and coordinately. The effectiveness of the theoretical analysis results is verified by the computer simulation. This research provides the necessary theoretical reference {{not only for the}} application and maintenance of the existing bottom <b>door</b> <b>mechanism,</b> but also for the design, analysis and forecast of the new mechanism. It also lays the base for the motion reliability analysis of the mechanism...|$|R

40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. This report documents the independent analysis results corresponding to the Orbiter Mechanical Actuation System (MAS) hardware. Specifically, the MAS hardware consists of the following components: Air Data Probe (ADP); Elevon Seal Panel (ESP); External Tank Umbilical (ETU); Ku-Band Deploy (KBD); Payload Bay Doors (PBD); Payload Bay Radiators (PBR); Personnel Hatches (PH); Vent <b>Door</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (VDM); and Startracker <b>Door</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (SDM).

40|$|The {{results of}} the Independent Orbiter Assessment (IOA) of the Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Critical Items List (CIL) are presented. The IOA {{approach}} features a top-down analysis of the hardware to determine draft failure modes, criticality, and potential critical items. To preserve independence, this analysis was accomplished without reliance upon the results contained within the NASA FMEA/CIL documentation. The IOA results were then compared to the proposed Post 51 -L NASA FMEA/CIL baseline that was available. A resolution of each discrepancy from the comparison was provided through additional analysis as required. These discrepancies were flagged as issues, and recommendations were made based on the FMEA data available at the time. This report documents {{the results of that}} comparison for the Orbiter Mechanical Actuation System (MAS) hardware. Specifically, the MAS hardware consists of the following components: Air Data Probe (ADP); Elevon Seal Panel (ESP); External Tank Umbilical (ETU); Ku-Band Deploy (KBD); Payload Bay Doors (PBD); Payload Bay Radiators (PBR); Personnel Hatches (PH); Vent <b>Door</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (VDM); and Startracker <b>Door</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (SDM).

5000|$|On 28 February 1945, the RLM {{settled on}} a {{competing}} design, the Focke-Wulf Ta 183, as {{the winner of the}} Emergency Fighter program. This decision was based in part on the considerable design difficulties being encountered by the Messerschmitt P.1101 design team. For example, the cannon installation was proving too crowded, the mainwheel retraction and <b>door</b> <b>mechanisms</b> were too complex, the fuselage needed a great number of [...] "strong points" [...] to deal with loads, and the anticipated performance had fallen below the RLM specifications, due to increased weight.|$|R

25|$|The {{passenger}} {{doors are}} higher than on normal buses so that passengers can only board from designated shelters.

It turns out that the cooperative dynamics of lithium and oxygen can be characterized as a sliding <b>door</b> <b>mechanism.</b> It is rationalized why the local network fluctuations are of utmost importance for the lithium dynamics.

40|$|The use of cavity reveals many {{problems}} related to the application of weapons storage mechanisms, as the opening of doors at subsonic and supersonic speeds produces high intensity noise which could damage the internal stores and surrounding cavity structures. Furthermore, the flow inside the cavity could cause a considerable drag force on the object. The objective of this thesis is to explore experimentally {{the effect of the}} door kinematics in the transient phase of the cavity flow. Transient wall pressure at 12 pressure taps which are arranged in a line along the centreline of the cavity floor are measured in a very low-speed wind tunnel facility. Data were acquired for two opening <b>door</b> <b>mechanisms</b> – one appliance has a vertical <b>doors</b> opening <b>mechanism</b> with a longitudinal hinge, and the other one is a lateral sliding opening mechanism. In both cases, the door movement has been observed to affect cavity pressures {{over a long period of}} time, before reaching steady levels. A passive flow control (cylinder) was also demonstrated to act effectively in the shortening of the transient phase. These studies have been supported by the flow visualisation, and a preliminary use of Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) ...|$|R
