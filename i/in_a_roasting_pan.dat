50|$|Modern Icelandic {{bakeries}} offer a {{wide variety}} of breads and pastry. The first professional bakers in Iceland were Danish and this is still reflected in the professional traditions of Icelandic bakers. Long-time local favorites include snúður, a type of cinnamon roll, usually topped with glaze or melted chocolate, and skúffukaka, a single-layer chocolate cake baked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan,</b> covered with chocolate glaze and sprinkled with ground coconut.|$|E
50|$|For roasting, {{the food}} may {{be placed on}} a rack, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> or, to ensure even {{application}} of heat, may be rotated on a spit or rotisserie. If a pan is used, the juice can be retained for use in gravy, Yorkshire pudding, etc. During oven roasting, hot air circulates around the meat, cooking all sides evenly. There are several plans for roasting meat: low-temperature cooking, high-temperature cooking, and a combination of both. Each method can be suitable, depending on {{the food and the}} tastes of the people.|$|E
50|$|The baby cries. Bosko tickles {{his charge}} and then leaps for the piano; he intersperses his {{performance}} with shadow puppetry. Bruno reenters, happily joining the musical act by donning a lampshade {{as though it}} were a hoop skirt. Finally, the baby seems happy. Bosko dances off, skating upon a rug up to his stove, popping open the oven-door briefly to reveal a live bird <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan.</b> Our hero skips back, finally sliding into a decorative column, knocking over a small fish bowl, which flips over upon his head to the giggles of his audience.|$|E

50|$|<b>A</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> is <b>a</b> {{piece of}} {{cookware}} used for <b>roasting</b> meat <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oven, either {{with or without}} vegetables or other ingredients. <b>A</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> may be used with a rack that sits inside the pan and lets the meat sit above the fat and juice drippings.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> shallow <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> is {{normally}} used for roasting small cuts of meat, but large-size <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> {{are also used}} for cooking large poultry such as turkey or goose, or for larger cuts of meat. <b>A</b> deep <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> can hold vegetables and other ingredients that meat can sit on rather than a rack, letting the vegetables absorb the fat and juice from the meat while cooking. <b>A</b> deep <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> {{can also be used}} as a baking dish or basin, holding smaller baking dishes that must be surrounded by boiling water.|$|R
5000|$|Custard may {{be cooked}} in a {{bain-marie}} {{to keep a}} crust from forming {{on the outside of}} the custard before the interior is fully cooked. In the case of the crème brûlée, placing the ramekins <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> and filling the pan with hot water until it is 1/2 to 2/3 of the way up the sides of the ramekins transfers the heat to the custard gently, which prevents the custard from curdling. The humidity from the steam that rises as the water heats helps keep the top of the custard from becoming too dry.|$|E
50|$|Leo the Lion, on his tenth birthday, {{receives}} a {{book as a}} present, and after finding out that lions rarely live beyond ten years, a hungry Beaky Buzzard, who {{turns out to be}} the one who had sent the book to him in the first place, takes the chance to eat him for his meal. What follows is a series of attempts by Beaky to eat Leo, starting with making him slip off a cliff using a banana peel to try and kill him. After he lands, Beaky makes a sandwich out of Leo's tail, which he tricks Leo into biting so he will jump up in pain. Beaky proceeds to catch the lion <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> and starts to prep him for dinner.|$|E
5000|$|Unbeknownst to Fifer and Fiddler, {{however, the}} Big Bad Wolf {{and his three}} sons are {{stalking}} them. The Wolf dresses in drag, this time as Little Bo Peep and he/she sadly tells the pigs that he/she lost his/her sheep and doesn't {{know where to find}} them. Then the pigs discover the [...] "sheep" [...] (the Wolf's three sons in disguise) and the Wolf and his sons, still in disguise, run home to their cave, and the pigs follow. The Wolf then locks the door and swallows the key. At first, the pigs embarrassedly think that [...] "Bo Peep" [...] has romantic intentions (a rather unusual scene; [...] "Why, Bo Peep!"), but the wolves spring their trap and overwhelm the pigs. They try to blow the wolf alarm horn, but Practical doesn't come. Soon Fifer and Fiddler are soon put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> by the wolves and they tauntingly blow the horn repeatedly. Still hoping for Practical to come to their rescue, the pigs challenge the wolf cub blowing the horn to blow it real loud ("Uh, why don't you blow it loud?"). He tries to, but can't, and the pigs taunt him that it was [...] "a sissy blow." [...] So the Big Bad Wolf blows the horn to prove what the Wolf family is made of ("Sissy, huh? Gimme that horn. I'll show 'em!"). This time, it is so loud that Practical hears ("The Wolf!") and goes to the rescue, pulling the Wolf Pacifier mechanism along behind him.|$|E

50|$|Covering or {{uncovering}} <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> {{will depend}} upon the type of meat being roasted, or the recipe being followed. Generally, meat that is high in fat content, such as duck, has no need of being covered during <b>roasting.</b> <b>A</b> lean cut of meat, however, will benefit from being covered during <b>a</b> long <b>roasting</b> time, to retain juices and soften the meat (for example, <b>in</b> using <b>a</b> tajine for <b>roasting</b> meat).|$|R
50|$|Sous-vide {{low-temperature}} {{cooking is}} carried out by vacuum-sealing food <b>in</b> <b>a</b> plastic bag placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> water bath or combi steamer with precisely controlled temperature for a long time. The food may then be browned by heating the surfaces to a much higher temperature of perhaps 200 C, using <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> or <b>a</b> blow torch prior to serving.

25|$|According to Frank Hamilton Cushing, Native American cooking baskets {{used by the}} Zuni (Zuñi) {{developed}} from mesh casings woven to stabilize gourd water vessels. He reported witnessing cooking basket use by Havasupai in 1881. Roasting baskets covered with clay would be filled with wood coals and the product to be roasted. When the thus fired clay separated from the basket, it would become <b>a</b> usable clay <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> <b>in</b> itself. This indicates a steady progression from use of woven gourd casings to waterproof cooking baskets to pottery. Other than in many other cultures, Native Americans used and still use the heat source inside the cookware. Cooking baskets are filled with hot stones and <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> with wood coals. Native Americans would form a basket from large leaves to boil water, according to historian and novelist Louis L'Amour. As long as the flames did not reach above the level {{of water in the}} basket, the leaves would not burn through.|$|R

5000|$|Jus is a rich, lightly reduced stock used as <b>a</b> {{sauce for}} <b>roasted</b> meats. Many {{of these are}} started by {{deglazing}} the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan,</b> then reducing to achieve the rich flavour desired.|$|R
25|$|The {{next step}} in the process is the {{roasting}} of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasted</b> state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of the coffee and requirements for packaging.|$|R

50|$|When <b>roasting</b> any meat <b>in</b> <b>an</b> oven, trivet racks - which {{typically}} fit into <b>roasting</b> <b>pans</b> - {{are often used}} to enable the meat joint to be held above the direct heat of the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> and allow the juices of the joint to drip into the <b>roasting</b> <b>pan</b> for the subsequent making of gravy.|$|R
50|$|Once the starch is {{converted}} to sugar it can be readily fermented by Saccharomyces cerevisiae. However, first the sprouting process should be stopped. In order to do this, the partially sprouted grains are placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> oven and roasted until the sprouts are sterilized and dried. This process of sprouting and drying is called malting. Then the roasted sprouts are ground, rehydrated and fermented. This produces a crude beer. Evidence for beer industry {{has been found in}} ancient Egypt, and some archaeologists believe that neolithization of Northern Europe may have been preferential for barley {{as a result of its}} preferential capacity for fermentation.|$|R

50|$|In the UK, the {{tradition}} of pig roasting, which is more commonly known in the UK as <b>a</b> Hog <b>Roast,</b> is popular on many occasions, particularly parties and celebrations. It is usually an outdoor event, and a staple meal on many show events. The tradition is either to <b>roast</b> on <b>a</b> spit, turning the pig under <b>a</b> flame, or <b>in</b> <b>a</b> large oven <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>roasting</b> pan; roasting pigs around 130 lbs in weight is common in the UK. The pig is normally <b>roasted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> gas propane machine. The pig's skin is scored with a sharp blade and covered in water & salt to make the 'crackling'. In ancient times {{going all the way}} back to the Saxons, <b>roasting</b> <b>a</b> wild boar was often the centerpiece of a meal at Yuletide, with Yule being Freya's fest. The head was often the greatest delicacy, as evidenced by the survival of The Boar's Head Carol.|$|R
