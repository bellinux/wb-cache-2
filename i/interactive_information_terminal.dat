40|$|Abstract: Wide-Spread {{deployment}} for <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> visualization is difficult. Non-Specialist users need {{a general}} development method and a toolkit {{to support the}} generic data structures suited to tree, network and multi-dimensional data, special visualization techniques and interaction techniques, and well-known generic information tasks. This paper presents a model driven development method for <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> visualization. First, an <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> visualization interface model (IIVM) is proposed. Then, the development method for <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> visualization based on IIVM is presented. The Daisy toolkit is introduced, which includes Daisy model builder, Daisy IIV generator and runtime framework with Daisy library. Finally, an application example is given. Experimental results show that Daisy can provide a general solution for development for <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> visualization...|$|R

IDLE is a language designed to describe the user interface of <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> servers in a way that allows automatic translation of W 3 -requests to server-commands. <b>Interactive</b> <b>information</b> servers described with IDLE can be accessed by any W 3 -browser via a special translation server.

40|$|The {{primary goal}} {{of this paper is}} to define and study the <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> {{complexity}} of functions. Let f(x, y) be a function, and suppose Alice is given x and Bob is given y. Informally, the <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> complexity IC(f) of f is the least amount of information Alice and Bob need to reveal to each other to compute f. Previously, information complexity has been defined with respect to a prior distribution on the input pairs (x, y). Our first goal is to give a definition that is independent of the prior distribution. We show that several possible definitions are essentially equivalent. We establish some basic properties of the <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> complexity IC(f). In par-ticular, we show that IC(f) is equal to the amortized (randomized) communication complexity of f. We also show a direct sum theorem for IC(f) and give the first general connection be-tween information complexity and (non-amortized) communication complexity. We explore the information complexity of two specific problems – Equality and Disjointness. We conclude with a list of open problems and research directions...|$|R

40|$|Following from Tarbush (2011 a), {{we explore}} the {{implications}} of using two different definitions of informativeness over kens; one that ranks objective, and the other subjective information. With the first, we create a new semantic operation {{that allows us to}} derive agreement theorems even when decision functions are based on <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> (for any r ≥ 0). Effectively, this operation, unlike information cell union captures the notion of an agent becoming “more ignorant” for all modal depths. Using the definition that ranks subjective information however, we show an impossibility result: In generic models, agreement theorems using the standard Sure-Thing Principle do not hold when decision functions depend on <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> (when r > 0). ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Digital <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> {{displays}} {{are becoming}} more common in public spaces such as museums, galleries, and libraries. However, the public nature of these locations requires special considerations concerning the design of information visualization in terms of visual representations and interaction techniques. We discuss the potential for, and challenges of, information visualization in the museum context based on our practical experience with EMDialog, an <b>interactive</b> <b>information</b> presentation {{that was part of}} the Emily Carr exhibition at the Glenbow Museum in Calgary. EMDialog visualizes the diverse and multi-faceted discourse about Emily Carr, a Canadian artist, with the goal to both inform and provoke discussion. It provides a visual environment that allows for exploration of the interplay between two integrated visualizations, one for information access along temporal, and the other along contextual dimensions. We describe the results of an observational study we conducted at the museum that revealed the different ways visitors approached and interacted with EMDialog, as well as how they perceived this form of information presentation in the museum context. Our results include the need to present information in a manner sufficiently attractive to draw attention and the importance of rewarding passive observation as well as both short and longer term information exploration.
