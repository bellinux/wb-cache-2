5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} by Yuji Horii around 1981, {{when he was}} 27 years old, shortly after he bought his first computer and learned to program with it by modifying other games. During this time, he read a PC magazine article about a computer game genre in the United States, text adventures. Horii noticed the lack of such games in the Japanese market and decided to create an adventure <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> own. Horii also cited the manga authors Tetsuya Chiba, Mitsuru Adachi and Katsuhiro Otomo as influences. The game was developed using the BASIC programming language.|$|E
5|$|Then, on September 7 he {{came within}} four outs of {{perfection}} when Milwaukee Brewers' Gabe Kapler hit a one-out {{home run in}} the eighth inning.

5|$|Adenhart had a 6–0 {{record with}} a 1.04 earned run average {{during the regular season}} in his junior year, and as a result was named the Gatorade Player of the Year in Maryland.

5|$|Entering {{his senior}} year, many scouts had Croyle ranked {{as high as}} the #2 quarterback in the country behind Joe Mauer, who would go on to play Major League Baseball. However, Croyle's high school career ended {{abruptly}} in the first <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> senior season against Glencoe High School after a hit by an opposing player tore Croyle's anterior cruciate ligament (ACL), causing him to miss the remainder of his senior year. When he graduated, he held the Alabama state records for career passing yards with 9,323, and career touchdowns with 105. He set marks for most passing yards in a single season, passing yards in a single game, touchdown passes in a season, and touchdown passes in a game.|$|E
5|$|He {{spent the}} 1964–65 season {{playing for the}} reserve side. On 1 January 1965 he became the only footballer to ever be knighted (for {{services}} to football) whilst still an active professional player; though he never thought himself worthy of such an honour. His only first team appearance of the season was also the last Football League <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career; it came on 6 February 1965, just after his 50th birthday, and was necessitated by injuries to both Peter Dobing and Gerry Bridgwood. The opponents that day were Fulham, and Stoke won the game 3–1.

He completed 21 of 40 for 240 yards and three touchdowns (the 50th <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> career with 3+ touchdown passes). It was the first time the Colts have won in Pittsburgh since 1968 (12 straight losses before this win).

St. Louis completed the season second in the AA among the nine teams, 8.5games behind the champion Reds.|$|E

5|$|Boulding {{started the}} first <b>game</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> second season with Bradford City, which ended with City losing 5–0 to Notts County, {{but he soon}} lost his place to new signings Gareth Evans and James Hanson and so had to wait another seven weeks for his second start which came against Northampton Town because Evans was suspended. He scored his first goal {{of the season in}} the game to give City a 2–0 lead, but his side conceded twice for the game to finish in a 2–2 draw. He scored in the club's {{following}} two games, but was then kept out of the side for two weeks by a virus. Upon his return, he scored his 100thcareer goal and his fourth goal in five games as a late consolation in an FA Cup defeat to Notts County. However, Boulding continued to struggle to maintain a first-team place and was released early from his contract in March 2010, along with his brother under mutual consent, after failing to make a single start under new manager Peter Taylor. He had played 71 games at City, although nearly one-third were as substitute, and scored 19 goals.|$|E
