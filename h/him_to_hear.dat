On the church's lawn before his speech, Rabbi Frank introduced himself to Rockwell and welcomed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> his speech. When Rockwell proposed that he meet with Rabbi Frank later to clear up some misunderstandings, Rabbi Frank agreed to do so.|$|E

Alomía Robles said that he had a good ear and could reproduce any sound that he heard and that he took special pleasure as a child in singing the indigenous songs of Peru.|$|E

25|$|Such oaths {{may have}} been used in civil claims, {{regarding}} supposed theft, for example, and the commandment is repeated in the context of honest dealings between people in Leviticus 19:12. At one point of the account of the dedication of the Temple of Solomon, Solomon prays to Yahweh, asking <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> and act upon curses uttered in a dispute that are then brought before his altar, to distinguish between the person in the right and the one in the wrong.|$|E
25|$|During World War II, Doctor Ludvig Maxis formed Group 935, a {{group of}} {{scientists}} that was intended to improve the human condition. Lacking funds, they soon turned to creating superweapons to aid the Nazis. Their discovery of Element 115 from a meteorite in Japan lead to the creation of zombies. Maxis and his assistant, Dr. Edward Richtofen, also work on other projects, leading to the creation of teleportation devices and 115-powered weapons. Attempting to use himself as a test subject, Richtofen accidentally teleports to a catacomb within the Moon, where he comes into contact with a mysterious pyramid device that causes <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> mysterious voices, slowly taking away his sanity. He is later teleported to an exotic jungle known as Shangri-La, where he spends three weeks studying the Vril energy force. Upon returning to Germany, Richtofen secretly forms a plan to kill Maxis, and gathers many members of Group 935 to build a moon base, known as Griffin Station. While maintaining his cover with Maxis and the rest of Group 935, Richtofen manages to capture three soldiers: Tank Dempsey, Nikolai Belinski, and Takeo Masaki; he begins to conduct experiments with Element 115, causing memory loss for all three soldiers.|$|E
500|$|His {{appointment}} to the King's Bench Division allowed <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> pension appeals, and he attempted to reform the principles applied by the government minister and the Pensions Tribunals. In Starr v Ministry of Pensions [...] 1 KB 345 he ruled that {{it was up to}} the tribunals to prove that an injury was not due to war service, reversing the previous state of affairs where a claimant would have to prove their injuries were due to war service before they would be granted a pension. In James v Minister of Pensions [...] KB 867 he also allowed for judges to approve time extensions for the claimant to gather more evidence when such extensions had been rejected by the Tribunal. These two cases made a large difference to applicants, and he received praise from both the British Legion and the public.|$|E

500|$|Much of what {{is known}} about Asser comes from his {{biography}} of Alfred, in particular a short section in which Asser recounts how Alfred recruited him as a scholar for his court. Alfred held a high opinion of the value of learning and recruited men from around Britain and from continental Europe to establish a scholarly centre at his court. It is not known how Alfred heard of Asser, but one possibility relates to Alfred's overlordship of south Wales. Several kings, including Hywel ap Rhys of Glywysing and Hyfaidd of Dyfed (where Asser's monastery was), had submitted to Alfred's overlordship in 885. Asser gives a fairly detailed account of the events. There is a charter of Hywel's which has been dated to c. 885; amongst the witnesses is one [...] "Asser", which may be the same person. Hence it is possible that Alfred's relationship with the southern Welsh kings led <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> of Asser.|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga, Bennett {{wanted her}} to sing {{different}} songs and was impressed by her vocals during [...] "Lush Life", referring to the Billy Strayhorn written standard that has been recorded by everyone from Nancy Wilson and Sarah Vaughan to Donna Summer and Linda Ronstadt. Gaga explained that she was nervous about recording with Bennett. [...] "I just wanted <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> I have an authentic jazz voice and that I studied that... If he can hear that, I'm okay. If he can't hear it, I'm not an authentic jazz voice", she added. Inspiration for singing came from jazz singer Amy Winehouse, who died in July 2011; Gaga added [...] "I thought of her almost {{every day in the}} studio. I wish she was still here. She was jazz to her core". The songs were recorded live with the band, and during the recording process Gaga asked for carpets to be placed on the studio floor, so that it looked like a film set and it could be photographed.|$|E
500|$|According to Casting Crowns' {{lead singer}} Mark Hall, {{the idea for}} [...] "Who Am I" [...] came while he was driving home {{with his wife and}} {{children}} one night. Hall, who was having personal worship time during the drive, recounts that he wondered [...] "Who am I to think I can just call up to God whenever I want, from the middle of nowhere, and expect <b>Him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> me?" [...] Hall says [...] "immediately I started thinking I'm a new creation, I'm more than a conqueror... I'm [...] grass, that is rises up and is gone in a day". In an interview, he commented that [...] "me being a conqueror is true, {{but at the same time}} I need to understand that my life is a vapor, and me being able to even pray to [...] is because of what he's done for me". [...] "Who Am I" [...] was produced by Mark A. Miller and Steven Curtis Chapman. It was recorded at Glow In The Dark Studio in Decatur, Georgia and Zoo Studio in Franklin, Tennessee, and it was engineered by Matt Goldman and Sam Hewitt.|$|E

500|$|Campbell {{attended}} the Alfred E. Smith Career and Technical Education High School in the Bronx, where his height, frame, and demeanor {{on the basketball}} court prompted the other kids to nickname him [...] "Hercules". He began running with a graffiti crew called the Ex-Vandals, taking the name Kool Herc. Herc recalls persuading his father to buy him a copy of [...] "Sex Machine" [...] by James Brown, a record that not a lot of his friends had, and which they would come to <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear.</b> He and his sister, Cindy, began hosting back-to-school parties in the recreation room of their building, 1520 Sedgwick Avenue. Herc's first soundsystem consisted of two turntables connected to two amplifiers and a Shure [...] "Vocal Master" [...] PA system with 2 speakers columns, on which he played records such as James Brown's [...] "Give It Up or Turnit a Loose", Jimmy Castor's [...] "It's Just Begun" [...] and Booker T. & the M.G.'s' [...] "Melting Pot". With Bronx clubs struggling with street gangs, uptown DJs catering to an older disco crowd with different aspirations, and commercial radio also catering to a demographic distinct from teenagers in the Bronx, Herc's parties had a ready-made audience.|$|E
500|$|Jim calls Wallace {{to pitch}} for the CEO {{to invest in}} Athlead. Dwight puts the {{conversation}} on speaker phone, allowing <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Wallace first tell Jim his salary {{is going to be}} cut to reflect his part-time status, and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead. Dwight, though praising his friends' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras, gradually comes to realize his professional integrity will not allow him to hire any of them, and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours. Afraid they will hate him if he does not pick one of them, he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one. Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate, Jim agrees. However, when Jim announces the decision, Rolf immediately intuits that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat. Dwight's friends storm off to play paintball without him, later sending an e-mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message [...] "Glad you're not here". Clark gets the salesman job. Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her [...] "old deskmate", i.e. Jim. Pam briefly lifts Dwight's spirits by suggesting they [...] "haze the new guy", though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap. It is also hinted that Brian (Chris Diamantopoulos), the boom mike operator for the documentary crew, has developed a crush on Pam.|$|E

2500|$|Sweet Nothing in My Ear is a {{television}} movie that debuted on the CBS television network as a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie [...] on April 20, 2008.

It stars Jeff Daniels and Marlee Matlin as the parents of a Deaf child, played by Noah Valencia, who struggle with deciding to give their child an implant that will allow <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> again.|$|E
2500|$|The {{religious}} revival {{known as}} the [...] Great Awakening reached Virginia when Henry was a child. His father was staunchly Anglican, but his mother often took <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> Presbyterian preachers. Although Henry remained a lifelong Anglican communicant, ministers such as Samuel Davies taught him {{that it is not}} enough to save one's own soul, but one should help to save society. He also learned that oratory should reach the heart, not just persuade based on reason. His oratorical technique would follow that of these preachers, seeking to reach the people by speaking to them in their own language.|$|E
2500|$|Shaver {{claimed to}} have worked in a factory where, in 1932, odd things began to occur. As Bruce Lanier Wright notes, Shaver [...] "began to notice {{that one of the}} welding guns on his job site, 'by some freak of its coil's field atunements', was {{allowing}} <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the thoughts of the men working around him. More frighteningly, he then received the telepathic record of a torture session conducted by malign entities in caverns deep within the earth". According to Michael Barkun, Shaver offered inconsistent accounts of how he first learned of the hidden cavern world, but that the assembly line story was the [...] "most common version". Shaver said he then quit his job, and became a hobo for a while.|$|E

2500|$|Mundungus [...] "Dung" [...] Fletcher is {{mentioned}} in passing {{in some of}} the earlier books in the series, but it is not until the second chapter of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that he makes his first appearance. Mundungus is described as a [...] "squat, unshaven man" [...] with [...] "short, bandy legs", [...] "long, straggly ginger hair", and [...] "bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound". He is involved in many illegal activities, yet he seems confined to relatively minor crimes, such as theft and trading stolen goods on the black market. Many members of the Order have mixed feelings about him, but he is very loyal to Dumbledore, who once got him out of serious trouble. His connections enable <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> rumours and information rolling around the shadier segments of the wizarding population, which could potentially prove instrumental in the fight against Voldemort.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} after his arrest, Moskvin explained {{that as an}} expert on Celtic culture, he had learned that the ancient Druids slept on graves in order to communicate with spirits of their dead. He also studied {{the culture of the}} peoples of Siberia, in particular, the culture of the ancient Yakuts, and discovered they had a similar practice for communicating with the dead. Moskvin began searching for obituaries of recently dead children. When he found an obituary that [...] "spoke" [...] to him, he would sleep on her grave in order to determine if the child's spirit wished to be brought back to life. Moskvin claimed he had been doing this for around twenty years and insisted that when he began, he never dug up a grave without the permission of the child within. As he grew older, it became physically painful for him to sleep on the graves, so he began bringing the bodies home where it would be more comfortable to sleep near them. He hoped the spirits would be more willing to speak in a safe, welcoming home and that they might be easier for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> when they were no longer underground.|$|E
2500|$|By 664, Empress Wu, {{who felt}} that her power was well established, was {{extending}} her influence further in the political arena, and when the eunuch Wang Fusheng (王伏勝) reported to Emperor Gaozong that she had engaged the sorcerer Guo Xingzhen (郭行真) – an act that was strictly forbidden—Emperor Gaozong, in anger, summoned the chancellor Shangguan Yi to consult Shangguan. [...] Shangguan suggested that he depose Empress Wu. [...] He agreed, and had Shangguan draft an edict to that effect. [...] However, Empress Wu had received information that that was happening, and she emerged to defend herself. [...] Emperor Gaozong could not carry out the removal, and instead blamed Shangguan. [...] As both Shangguan and Wang had previously served the former crown prince Li Zhong, Empress Wu had Xu Jingzong falsely accuse Shangguan, Wang, and Li Zhong of conspiring against Emperor Gaozong's life. [...] Around the new year 665, Shangguan and Wang were executed, and Li Zhong was forced to commit suicide. [...] From this point on, whenever Emperor Gaozong presided over imperial meetings, Empress Wu would sit behind a pearl screen behind <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> the reports as well, and political power largely fell into her hands. [...] She and Emperor Gaozong were thereafter {{referred to as the}} [...] "Two Saints." ...|$|E
