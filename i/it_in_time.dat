5|$|Although the Admiralty saw no use {{to which}} Halkett's designs could be put in general naval service, this larger design was {{extremely}} well received by explorers. John Franklin bought one {{to take on the}} ill-fated 1845 expedition in which the entire expedition party of 129men and two ships vanished. Franklin saw Halkett boats as so essential to travel in Canada that he gave the boat intended for his expedition to Sir George Simpson, Governor-in-Chief of Rupert's Land, for use in his travels in the region. He ordered a replacement boat from Halkett, who delivered <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> for him to take possession before setting out on his last expedition.|$|E
5|$|Piłsudski's PPS, {{while not}} {{planning}} for a major uprising then and there, had a policy of supporting the protest and harassing Russian forces. The PPS, {{as well as other}} socialist organizations, such as Jewish Bund and SDKPiL, were as surprised by the scale of the spontaneous revolt as the Russian authorities; PPS forces in Łódź consisted of 10 regular and armed PPS members and a few dozen semi-enlisted workers. A larger group sent from Warsaw under Walery Sławek never made <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> to take control or affect the uprising; it was, in the end, an anarchic and unorganized violent protest against the Russian government.|$|E
5|$|Through WED Enterprises, {{a legally}} {{separate}} entity from Walt Disney Productions, Walt Disney retained personal {{ownership of the}} DRR and financed the creation of two trains to run on <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> for Disneyland's opening day. The names of both trains contained the word Retlaw, which is Walter spelled backwards. The first train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 1, would be pulled by the No. 2 locomotive, which was given a turn-of-the-20th century appearance with a straight smokestack (typical of coal-burning locomotives), a circular headlamp, and a small cowcatcher. The No. 2 locomotive would pull six 1890s-style passenger cars designed by Bob Gurr, consisting of a combine car, four coaches, and an observation coach. The second train, referred to by Disneyland employees as Retlaw 2, would be pulled by the No. 1 locomotive, which was given a late-19th century appearance with a spark-arresting diamond smokestack (typical of wood-burning locomotives), a rectangular headlamp, and a large cowcatcher. The No. 1 locomotive would pull six freight cars consisting of three cattle cars, two gondolas, and a caboose. Walt Disney Studios built the train cars {{and most of the}} parts for the locomotives; Dixon Boiler Works built the locomotive boilers, and Wilmington Iron Works built the locomotive frames. Both locomotives were designed to run on diesel oil to generate steam. Final assembly of the locomotives and their tenders took place at the Disneyland site in the DRR's new roundhouse, which was built in one week by a construction crew directed by Park Construction Administrator Joe Fowler, a former US Navy rear admiral. The two original DRR trains cost over $240,000 to build, with the two locomotives costing over $40,000 each.|$|E

5|$|While {{the video}} was filmed {{as a single}} shot on at least three {{different}} occasions, they planned on using post-editing to slow down or speed up {{certain parts of the}} take to keep <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> with the final soundtrack. There is a noted cut in the video, in which the camera passes through a set of curtains on the transition to the downstairs portion of the machine; according to one of the machine designers, Hector Alvarez, this cut was introduced by the band, speculating it was introduced to avoid a shot of one of the band members or cameraman in frame or otherwise to keep the machine video synchronized to the machine. Both Tim Nordwind, bassist for the band, and Adam Sadowsky, president of Syyn Labs, said that while the machine worked in its entirety 3 times, and no cut was needed, the decision was made so a better result on the downstairs portion could be included in the final version. There was also a second cut which can be noticed by watching a piano against a wall as the camera passed behind some rods; the piano can be seen apparently warping in shape and position.|$|E

25|$|Large {{areas of}} the Union-Miles Park area {{continued}} to be under-developed in the early 20th century. Hamilton Avenue was renamed Harvard Avenue in 1905, but the dirt road did not begin to be paved until 1914. Roads were so bad that when St. Catherine Church (at E. 93rd and St. Catherine Avenue) caught fire in March 1899, the poor condition of the roads prevented firefighting personnel from reaching <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> and the new church {{burned to the ground}} (and was rebuilt).

25|$|The Union army {{converged on}} Vicksburg, {{trapping}} Pemberton's force. Grant attempted two assaults {{to break through}} the strong Confederate fieldworks: May 19 and May 22. The latter assault initially achieved some success in McClernand's sector, but it was repulsed with 3,200 casualties. Johnston ordered Pemberton to evacuate the city and save his army, but Pemberton thought it impossible to withdraw safely. Johnston planned to attack Grant and relieve Pemberton but was unable to arrange <b>it</b> <b>in</b> <b>time.</b> Grant besieged the Confederate army. On July 4, after six weeks in which the soldiers and civilians of Vicksburg had no food supplies and were bombarded constantly, Pemberton surrendered the city and his army.|$|E

Lt. Gen. Raad al-Hamdani, who was in command of the Karbala region, protested this and argued that unless reinforcements were rushed to the Karbala gap immediately to prevent a breach, U.S. forces would reach Baghdad within 48 hours, but his suggestions fell on deaf ears. American troops rushed through the gap and reached the Euphrates River at the town of Musayib.
