40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV- 1) establishes latency in sensory neurons is largely unknown. Recent studies indicate that epigenetic modifications of the chromatin associated with the latent genome may {{play a key role}} in the transcriptional control of lytic genes during latency. In this study, we found both constitutive and <b>facultative</b> types of <b>heterochromatin</b> to be present on the latent HSV- 1 genome. Deposition of the facultative marks trimethyl H 3 K 27 and histone variant macroH 2 A varied at different sites on the genome, whereas the constitutive marker trimethyl H 3 K 9 did not. In addition, we show that in the absence of the latency-associated transcript (LAT), the latent genome shows a dramatic increase in trimethyl H 3 K 27, suggesting that expression of the LAT during latency may act to promote an appropriate heterochromatic state that represses lytic genes but is still poised for reactivation. Due to the presence of the mark trimethyl H 3 K 27, we examined whether Polycomb group proteins, which methylate H 3 K 27, were present on the HSV- 1 genome during latency. Our data indicate that Bmi 1, a member of the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC 1) maintenance complex, associates with specific sites in the genome, with the highest level of enrichment at the LAT enhancer.

50|$|The term epigenetics {{refers to}} {{three levels of}} gene regulation: (1) DNA methylation, (2) histone modifications, and (3) non-coding RNA (ncRNA) function. Briefly, histone-mediated {{transcriptional}} control occurs by the wrapping of DNA around a histone core. This DNA-histone structure is called a nucleosome; the more tightly the DNA is bound by the nucleosome, and the more tightly a string of nucleosomes are compressed among each other, the greater the repressive effect on transcription of genes in the DNA sequences near or wrapped around the histones, and vice versa (i.e. looser DNA binding and relaxed compaction leads to a comparatively derepressed state, resulting in <b>facultative</b> <b>heterochromatin</b> or, even further derepressed, euchromatin). At its most repressive state, involving many folds into itself and other scaffolding proteins, DNA-histone structures form constitutive heterochromatin. This chromatin structure is mediated by these three levels of gene regulation. The most relevant epigenetic modifications to treatment of neurodegenerative diseases are DNA methylation and histone protein modifications via methylation or acetylation.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the ways}} that latency is {{achieved}} and maintained is through histone modification. It is known that methylation of histones often serve as marks that cause the formation of heterochromatin, an inactive form of chromatin, while acetylation often marks euchromatin, an active form of chromatin. In EBV, The amount and location of the histone modifications is different for each latency program. There are several promoter regions which are the key targets of this histone modification in each of these programs. There are the Cp and Qp promoter regions. The Cp promoter promotes the transcription of all the EBNA genes from a polycistronic mRNA. The Q promoter (Qp) promotes the transcription of EBNA1. In type I latency, the Qp is acetylated and active while the Cp region is methylated and inactive. The opposite is true in type III latency where the Cp region is active and the Qp region is inactive. In both of these types of latency, H3K27me is slightly enriched in the lytic immediate early promoters. This suggests that <b>facultative</b> <b>heterochromatin</b> interacts with the polycomb repression complex in order to limit lytic reactivation.|$|E

40|$|Heterochromatin {{is defined}} classically by {{condensation}} throughout the cell cycle, replication in late S phase and gene inactivity. <b>Facultative</b> <b>heterochromatin</b> {{is of particular}} interest, because its formation is developmentally regulated {{as a result of}} cellular differentiation. The most extensive example of <b>facultative</b> <b>heterochromatin</b> is the mammalian inactive X chromosome (Xi). A variety of histone variants and covalent histone modifications have been implicated in defining the organization of the Xi heterochromatic state, and the features of Xi heterochromatin have been widely interpreted as reflecting a redundant system of gene silencing. However, here we demonstrate that the human Xi is packaged into at least two nonoverlapping heterochromatin types, each characterized by specific Xi features: one defined by the presence of Xi-specific transcript RNA, the histone variant macroH 2 A, and histone H 3 trimethylated at lysine 27 and the other defined by H 3 trimethylated at lysine 9, heterochromatin protein 1, and histone H 4 trimethylated at lysine 20. Furthermore, regions of the Xi packaged in different heterochromatin types are characterized by different patterns of replication in late S phase.

Recent studies have shown the importance of chromatin structure in the regulation of latent infection for both HSV and HIV. For HSV, we have shown previously that the viral latency-associated transcript (LAT) promotes lytic gene silencing and the association of one heterochromatin marker, dimethylation of lysine 9 on histone H 3 (H 3 K 9 me 2), with viral lytic genes. In this study, we further defined the structure of latent viral chromatin by examining the heterochromatin markers on histones associated with the HSV latent genome.

At the organism level, homozygous Hira knockout is embryonically lethal in mice. Several previously established mouse strains have a transgene inserted into a variety of genomic locations including regions of putative <b>facultative</b> <b>heterochromatin</b> and constitutive (pericentromeric) heterochromatin where it displays position effect variegation (PEV) in that the transgene is stochastically silenced in a proportion of T cells. The effects of HIRA deficiency on PEV of this transgene showed that HIRA was necessary for PEV in putative <b>facultative</b> <b>heterochromatin</b> and it appeared that, in this environment, it played a role both in the rate of establishment (during T cell development) and in the maintenance of PEV (in mature T cells). This was in contrast to its effect in constitutive (pericentromeric) heterochromatin where Hira knockout in vivo had no effect on the variegation of a transgene. On the other hand, the reduction in variegation usually induced by T cell activation was lessened by HIRA deficiency in another mouse strain where the transgene was located in close proximity to pericentromeric heterochromatin.

To identify a human ES cell model for X-inactivation and study differences in the epigenetic state of hESC lines, we investigated X-inactivation in all growth competent, karyotypically normal, NIH approved, female hESC lines and several sublines. In the vast majority of undifferentiated cultures of nine lines examined, essentially all cells exhibit hallmarks of X-inactivation.

Strikingly, we found that trimethylated histone H 3 at lysine 36 (H 3 K 36 me 3), which was previously identified as a hallmark of actively transcribed regions, is deposited onto the silenced, maternally contributed 3 -Mb imprinted region.

We previously reported that de novo induction of the NF-κB transcription factor RelB by endotoxin activation is necessary and sufficient for silencing transcription of acute proinflammatory genes in the endotoxin tolerant SSI phenotype.

The paternal and maternal pronuclei in one-cell mouse embryos show a striking non-equivalence in Me 9 H 3 : the paternal pronucleus contains no immunocytologically detectable Me 9 H 3. The levels of Me 9 H 3 on the parental chromosomes only become equivalent after the two-cell stage. Finally, we provide evidence that Me 9 H 3 is neither necessary nor sufficient for localisation of heterochromatin protein 1 (HP 1) to chromosomal DNA...|$|E
