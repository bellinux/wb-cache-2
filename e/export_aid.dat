First, I will examine the first major application of state aid rules, <b>export</b> <b>aid</b> for intra-Community trade. Second, I will turn to early Commission efforts in the area of regional aid, in which the system of differentiated aid maxima for different regions of the Community were created and expanded. Third, I will consider the impact that the addition of new, poorer member states has had on state aid policy. Fourth, I consider Commission efforts in two important sectors, textiles and automobiles. Fifth, I analyze the introduction and development of the most important horizontal framework, that for research and development. Sixth, the focus shifts to the question of efforts to evade legal history of state aid rules and their application. In particular, this will focus on Commission initiatives such as the Transparency Directive and the rules on cumulation of aids, and especially on the use of repayment orders beginning in the mid- 1980 s. Seventh, I consider the crucial cases defining the powers of the Commission (in particular, Philip Morris) and the rights of third parties.

40|$|The Czech Republic {{is part of}} {{integrated}} domestic market of the European Union and it is abided by rules of the Common agricultural policy for the common organization {{of the market for}} single sectors of commodities in case of agrarian products. All Czech commodities have free access on the whole territory of domestic market of the European Union without the tariff and non-tariff barriers. It was abolished the customs procedure, the proving of the origin and the founding of bonded warehouse and the paying of licence fee and charges for certification. The Czech farmers (vine-growers) can operate in stabilized business environment on the basis of definite rules of economic competition. The Czech Republic within a regulation of an agrarian trade must manage common regulations of a horizontal character and vertical regulations for the sectors of commodities after the integration into the EU. The regulation is executed through the common organization of the market. The common organization of the market in wine is based on three principles – regulation of the supply, regulation of the wine quality and regulation of the market. These rules are concerned with domestic market, when the commodities move within European Union and within foreign trade, when commodities are transported a frontier. The regulation of external agrarian trade, which is concerned with conditions of import and conditions of export, is executed through the so-called trade mechanisms. The import licence and export licence, <b>export</b> <b>aid</b> and guarantee belong among these mechanisms of regulation.

There is, however, scant information on the effectiveness of previous support for export development to inform the design of new initiatives. In this paper, we exploit information on product specific technical assistance for trade and estimate a simple partial equilibrium model to assess the impact on the key measurable outcome - exports of the product subject to assistance. We apply a difference in differences approach to isolate the impact of the policy interventions and draw four main conclusions: on average, export development (ED) programs have coincided with or predated stronger export performance; such programs appear to be more effective where there is already significant export activity; there is some concern about the additionality of the programs and that support may be being channeled to sectors that would have prospered anyway; ultimately, conclusions strongly depend on what one postulates would have happened {{in the absence of the}} policy intervention, so the definition of a credible counterfactual is of utmost importance for the evaluation of technical assistance for <b>exports.</b> <b>aid</b> for trade, <b>export</b> development, difference in differences, developing countries,...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Remittances are an {{important}} source of foreign exchange earnings for many of the poorest developing countries. For this reason, a number of studies including Puri and Ritzema (1999), Chami, Fullenkamp, and Jahjah (2003), and Bouhga-Hagbe (2004) focus on the determinants of remittances. This dissertation models remittances as a transfer within a “multi-national ” family for which remittances may be either be saved, used to finance investment in housing or schooling for example or simply consumed. The model provides several hypotheses regarding how remittances might affect household spending and investment decisions in the home country. In particular, we use the estimation framework of Gruben and McLeod (1998), Bosworth and Collins (1999), Mody and Murshid (2002) and especially Bouhga-Hagbe (2004) to study the impact of remittances on savings, investment and growth rates in a panel of 62 developing countries for which long remittances series are available and compose either over 5 % of exports or imports or over 2 % of GDP. Where remittances are large relative to exports, they may also affect the real exchange rate and the trade balance. Where remittances are large with respect to imports, they finance a trade balance deficit. Finally, we can regress income by deciles and quintiles on remittances to investigate which household groups appear to benefit most from remittances compared to other sources of foreign exchange, including <b>exports,</b> <b>aid</b> grants and other capital inflows and transfers...|$|R

The legal and economic aspects of the agreement are examined, and the relevance of banning agricultural export subsidies are noted. This eliminates some of the worst-case scenarios, if agricultural world prices continue to soften and the important margin of export subsidies still allowed under the WTO framework was to be used. But given the relatively longer transition period for some relevant products before export subsidies are completely banned, the paper argues for continued monitoring of the potential use of this instrument. The paper also discusses the other components of export competition, looking into the legal and economic aspects. Some suggestions about continuous work on transparency and monitoring of current practices, and further disciplines are also presented.
