25|$|When a user accesses {{a journal}} issue, {{a table of}} {{contents}} is automatically generated by retrieving all articles, letters, editorials, etc. for that issue. When an actual item such as an article is reached, PubMed Central converts the NLM markup to HTML for delivery, and provides links to related data objects. This is feasible because the variety of <b>incoming</b> <b>data</b> has first been converted to standard DTDs and graphic formats.|$|E
25|$|Kant {{saw that}} the mind could not {{function}} as an empty container that simply receives data from outside. Something must be giving order to the <b>incoming</b> <b>data.</b> Images of external objects must be kept in the same sequence {{in which they were}} received. This ordering occurs through the mind's intuition of time. The same considerations apply to the mind's function of constituting space for ordering mappings of visual and tactile signals arriving via the already described chains of physical causation.|$|E
25|$|Very large {{radio telescopes}} on Earth were also {{listening}} to Huygens 10-watt transmission using {{the technique of}} very long baseline interferometry and aperture synthesis mode. At 11:25 CET on January 14, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) in West Virginia detected the carrier signal from Huygens. The GBT continued to detect the carrier signal well after Cassini stopped listening to the <b>incoming</b> <b>data</b> stream. In addition to the GBT, eight of the ten telescopes of the continent-wide VLBA in North America, located at Pie Town and Los Alamos, New Mexico; Fort Davis, Texas; North Liberty, Iowa; Kitt Peak, Arizona; Brewster, Washington; Owens Valley, California; and Mauna Kea, Hawaii, also listened for the Huygens signal.|$|E

25|$|CSU {{faculty members}} are noted for their {{research}} on great global challenges including the reemergence of tuberculosis, the brown cloud of air pollution in Asian cities, severe weather forecasting, nutrition and wellness, and bio-terrorism. CSU researchers in the Department of Atmospheric Sciences process and manage <b>incoming</b> <b>data</b> from a new satellite called CloudSat, which enables scientists to see cloud properties and vertical structure. Since its launch, CloudSat has made 5,307 orbits around the Earth. Abound Solar (formerly known as AVA Solar), a start-up formed by a CSU engineering professor, is commercializing a method for manufacturing low-cost, high-efficiency solar panels. Another research project has taken CSU faculty to Mexico to study dengue fever. Research in the Engines and Energy Conversion Laboratory has created a technological solution to limit pollutants from single-stroke engines, {{and is now in}} widespread use in the Philippines.|$|E
25|$|The {{basics of}} {{continuous}} backpropagation were derived {{in the context}} of control theory by Kelley in 1960 and by Bryson in 1961, using principles of dynamic programming. In 1962, Dreyfus published a simpler derivation based only on the chain rule. Bryson and Ho described it as a multi-stage dynamic system optimization method in 1969. In 1970, Linnainmaa finally published the general method for automatic differentiation (AD) of discrete connected networks of nested differentiable functions. This corresponds to the modern version of backpropagation which is efficient even when the networks are sparse. In 1973, Dreyfus used backpropagation to adapt parameters of controllers in proportion to error gradients. In 1974, Werbos mentioned the possibility of applying this principle to ANNs, and in 1982, he applied Linnainmaa's AD method to neural networks in the way that is widely used today. In 1986, Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams noted that this method can generate useful internal representations of <b>incoming</b> <b>data</b> in hidden layers of neural networks. In 1993, Wan was the first to win an international pattern recognition contest through backpropagation.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{experimental}} songs that Revolver featured was [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows", the lyrics for which Lennon drew from Timothy Leary's [...] Its creation involved eight tape decks distributed about the EMI building, each staffed by an engineer or band member, who randomly varied {{the movement of}} a tape loop while Martin created a composite recording by sampling the <b>incoming</b> <b>data.</b> McCartney's [...] "Eleanor Rigby" [...] made prominent use of a string octet; Gould describes it as [...] "a true hybrid, conforming to no recognisable style or genre of song". Harrison was developing as a songwriter, and three of his compositions earned {{a place on the}} record. In 2003, Rolling Stone ranked Revolver as the third greatest album of all time. During the US tour that followed its release, however, the band performed none of its songs. As Chris Ingham writes, they were very much [...] "studio creations... {{and there was no way}} a four-piece rock 'n' roll group could do them justice, particularly through the desensitising wall of the fans' screams. 'Live Beatles' and 'Studio Beatles' had become entirely different beasts." [...] The band's final concert at San Francisco's Candlestick Park on 29 August was their last commercial concert. It marked the end of a four-year period dominated by almost nonstop touring that included over 1,400 concert appearances internationally.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{a client}} initiates a {{connection}} and is informed {{of a successful}} invocation of the terminal services stack at the server, it loads up the device {{as well as the}} keyboard/mouse drivers. The UI data received over RDP is decoded and rendered as UI, whereas the keyboard and mouse inputs to the Window hosting the UI is intercepted by the drivers, and transmitted over RDP to the server. It also creates the other virtual channels and sets up the redirection. RDP communication can be encrypted; using either low, medium or high encryption. With low encryption, user input (outgoing data) is encrypted using a weak (40-bit RC4) cipher. With medium encryption, UI packets (<b>incoming</b> <b>data)</b> are encrypted using this weak cipher as well. [...] The setting [...] "High encryption (Non-export)" [...] uses 128-bit RC4 encryption [...] and [...] "High encryption (Export)" [...] uses 40-bit RC4 encryption.|$|E
