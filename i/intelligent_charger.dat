40|$|Algorithm for {{optimizing}} {{the charge}} and discharge of Secondary battery. With precision control of {{voltage and current}} levels in secondary batteries, high performance in battery life can be achieved and the problems of overcharging and over discharging in batteries can be avoided. By regulating the charge and discharge currents in a battery, voltage can be balanced. As the behavior of temperature and impedance of a battery is highly non-linear in nature, balancing current and voltage is very difficult. This paper proposes an Optimizing Intelligent Algorithm which can efficiently control the voltage and current levels by overcoming the problem of non-linear behavior of impedance in batteries. Results of the proposed algorithm from control circuit in an experiment are shown to provide efficient control of voltage and current levels in a battery increasing the battery life. Index Terms— — battery balance, impedance of battery, intelligent algorithm, secondary battery cell.

We consider the integration of wind power and <b>intelligent</b> <b>charging</b> of PEVs into the wholesale electricity market of the New York Control Area (NYCA). We use a data-based two-settlement energy market model for the NYCA and a commuter transportation model for New York State with 7, 560 scenarios. They include curtailable and must-take wind power penetrations of up to 25 %, PEV penetrations of up to 25 % and Level 1 /Level 2 mixtures of charger infrastructure in a span of 21 summer days in 2006. Preliminary results suggest that wind power and intelligently charged PEVs greatly benefit the NYCA as independent system-level resources. However, there {{does not appear to}} be noticeable system benefits and dispatch correlations from coupling must-take wind and PEVs. Consequently, the traditional view of synergy in the grid integration of wind power and PEV charging may not always hold, prompting the need for additional studies before designing the relevant energy policies.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{charging}} an electric car should involve {{more than just}} plugging a cable into an outlet. Charging needs to be convenient and cost-effective for the driver, as well as manageable and efficient for the energy provider, especially to ensure {{the stability of the}} electricity network given the growth of renewable energy sources. This goal is achievable only with an <b>intelligent</b> <b>charging</b> infrastructure, or one that is integrated in the power grid from a communications standpoint. Before electromobility can become established, e-vehicles, drivers, energy suppliers, grid operators and to some extent other parties such as billing service providers, must be able to interact with one another. Charging stations should be usable regardless of the manufacturer or location, reservable while travelling and be able to automatically carry out the charging process in accordance with pre-defined user settings. To reduce the load on the electricity network, energy providers need real-time information about the local short- and medium-term energy demand. They also need the ability to manage the charging process when required. For this reason, several factors {{play a key role in}} selecting the communication technology. Apart from the basic security aspects, this includes interoperability, the ability to exchange an extensive amount of data in a secure manner before, during and after charging, and efficient integration into the overall system, taking into account the costs and ease of use. This is something that only a uniform charging infrastructure with communication technology based on international standards can provide. Fraunhofer ESK researchers examined the potential standards and produced a white paper that summarizes the most important characteristics of a sustainable charging infrastructure. Using this detailed technology evaluation as a foundation, and by relying on ISO/IEC 15118 for the vehicle-to-charging station communication and IEC TR 61850 - 90 - 8 for the charging station-to-smart grid communication, Fraunhofer ESK designed an <b>intelligent</b> <b>charging</b> infrastructure that can be seamlessly integrated into the smart grid.

However, many existing literatures {{have focused on the}} <b>intelligent</b> <b>charging</b> strategy [15 – 20] in distribution grids, although discharging management [21 – 25] has attracted increased attentions in recent years. Smoothing the daily load profile is considered {{to be the most important}} issue [15 – 17, 21, 22] whereas electricity price and economic benefits of EV owners are the main motivating factors to obtain load leveling [17]. Some other studies introduced charging/discharging methods to decrease the operation cost [18], and power losses [19, 20, 23]. Several management strategies for EV charging/discharging were established to achieve this objective [24, 25]. In these discharging strategies studied in [21 – 25], EVs were mostly treated as storage systems while discharging procedure was considered. Strategies for combined charging/discharging with respect to the uncertainties such as travel patterns and initial battery state of charge (SOC), which are more close to the real condition, have not been investigated to date.|$|R
