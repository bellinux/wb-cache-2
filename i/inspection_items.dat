50|$|The second SWE/SWV {{arrangement}} is an interior {{placement of the}} source in an enclosed <b>inspection</b> <b>item</b> without having the source centered up. The source does not come {{in direct contact with}} the item, but is placed a distance away, depending on client requirements. The third is an exterior placement with similar characteristics. The fourth is reserved for flat objects, such as plate metal, and is also radiographed without the source coming in direct contact with the item. In each case, the radiographic film is located {{on the opposite side of}} the <b>inspection</b> <b>item</b> from the source. In all four cases, only one wall is exposed, and only one wall is viewed on the radiograph.|$|R
50|$|Of {{the other}} {{exposure}} arrangements, only the contact shot has the source {{located on the}} <b>inspection</b> <b>item.</b> This type of radiograph exposes both walls, but only resolves {{the image on the}} wall nearest the film. This exposure arrangement takes more time than a panoramic, as the source must first penetrate the WT twice and travel the entire outside diameter of the pipe or vessel to reach the film on the opposite side. This is a double wall exposure/single wall view DWE/SWV arrangement. Another is the superimposure (wherein the source is placed {{on one side of the}} item, not in direct contact with it, with the film on the opposite side). This arrangement is usually reserved for very small diameter piping or parts. The last DWE/SWV exposure arrangement is the elliptical, in which the source is offset from the plane of the <b>inspection</b> <b>item</b> (usually a weld in pipe) and the elliptical image of the weld furthest from the source is cast onto the film.|$|R

40|$|Managing {{the costs}} of {{supplies}} within healthcare facilities has been a task that has plagued the health industry for many years. Many facilities are accustomed to using a par system approach. This involves bringing an inventory item to an amount sufficient for daily operation. This method often requires daily inspection by a healthcare worker, which reduces his/her time spent performing value added tasks. Employees at small healthcare facilities have multiple responsibilities, therefore they cannot afford to spend much time on inventory management. A proposed approach is the Kanban method, which allows for strict monitoring of inventory items without the need of constant <b>inspection.</b> <b>Items</b> are organized according to the ABC classification system, with B and C items complying by a special case of the Kanban method, the two bin system. To implement such a system, healthcare employees must undergo training of inventory management principles. This educational training is a major component that allows employees to effectively sustain the inventory management system, as well as reproduce it across other residences on their campus. The purpose of this thesis was to develop an inventory management system for a small healthcare facility that is sustainable and transferrable...|$|E
50|$|First, {{there is}} the panoramic, {{one of the four}} {{single-wall}} exposure/single-wall view (SWE/SWV) arrangements. This exposure is created when the radiographer places the source of radiation {{at the center of a}} sphere, cone, or cylinder (including tanks, vessels, and piping). Depending upon client requirements, the radiographer would then place film cassettes on the outside of the surface to be examined. This exposure arrangement is nearly ideal - when properly arranged and exposed, all portions of all exposed film will be of the same approximate density. It also has the advantage of taking less time than other arrangements since the source must only penetrate the total wall thickness (WT) once and must only travel the radius of the <b>inspection</b> <b>item,</b> not its full diameter. The major disadvantage of the panoramic is that it may be impractical to reach the center of the item (enclosed pipe) or the source may be too weak to perform in this arrangement (large vessels or tanks).|$|R

40|$|Background: Tattooing {{and body}} {{piercing}} {{have a long}} history, and both have become increasingly fashionable worldwide. There is an association between tattooing/body piercing and hepatitis B and C infections. Method: We undertook an observational study to examine the prevalence and predictors of infection control practices among tattooists and body piercers in Sydney, Australia. Within each premise, data were obtained from owners/mangers and nominated staff completion of a knowledge and attitudes questionnaire, owner/manager demonstration of key infection control procedures, and an inspection of the premises. Results: Consent to participate was obtained in 41 of 44 premises (93. 2 %). A low proportion of owners/managers and staff gave the correct answer {{for the purpose of}} disinfection (52. 8 %/ 26. 9 %) and sterilization (50 %/ 53. 8 %). About one third of owners/managers (38. 8 %) and 56 % of staff reported that their infection control compliance could be improved. Approximately one quarter of owners/managers reported that the frequency of inspections was inadequate. Even though the majority of demonstration and <b>inspection</b> <b>items</b> were complied with, deficiencies were observed concerning washing of hands, wearing of gloves, and sterilization procedures. Conclusion: There is a continuing need to improve infection control performance among tattooists and body piercers.

40|$|Abstract. As charts {{to monitor}} the process {{fraction}} defectives, P, in the high-yield processes, Mishima et al. (2002) discussed a synthetic chart, the Synthetic CS chart, which integrates the CS (Confirmation Sample) CCC (Cumulative Count of Conforming) -r chart and the CCC-r chart. The Synthetic CS chart is designed to monitor quality characteristics in real-time. Recently, Kotani et al. (2005) presented the EWMA (Exponentially Weighted Moving-Average) CCC-r chart, which considers combining the quality characteristics monitored in the past with one monitored in real-time. In this paper, we present an alternative chart that is more superior to the EWMACCC-r chart. It is an integration of the EWMACCC-r chart and the CCC-r chart. In using the proposed chart, the quality characteristic is initially judged as either the in-control state or the out-of-control state, using the lower and upper control limits of the EWMACCC-r chart. If the process is not judged as the in-control state by the EWMACCC-r chart, the process is successively judged, using the CCC-r chart to confirm the judgement of the EWMACCC-r chart. We compare the ANOS (Average Number of Observations to Signal) of the proposed chart {{with those of the}} EWMACCC-r chart and the Synthetic CS chart. From the numerical experiments, with the small size of <b>inspection</b> <b>items,</b> the proposed chart is the most sensitive to detect especially the small shifts in P among othe...|$|E

40|$|One {{characteristic}} of computational statistics is {{the processing of}} enormous amounts of data. It is now possible to analyze large amounts of highdimensional data {{through the use of}} high-performance contemporary computers. In general, however, several problems occur when the number of dimensions becomes high. The first problem is an explosion in execution time. For example, the number of combinations of subsets taken from p variables is 2 p; when p exceeds 20, calculation becomes difficult pointing terms of computation time. When p exceeds 25, calculation becomes an impossible no matter what type of computer is used. This is a fundamental situation that arises in the selection of explanatory variables during regression analysis. The second problem is the sheer cost of surveys or experiments. When questionnaire surveys are conducted, burden is placed on the respondent because there are many questions. And since there are few <b>inspection</b> <b>items</b> to a patient, there are few the burdens on the body or on cost. The third problem is the essential restriction of methods. When the number of explanatory variables is greater than the data size, most methods are incapable of directly dealing with the data; microarray data are typical examples of this type of data. For these reasons, methods for dimension reduction without loss of statistical information are important techniques for data analysis. In this chapter, we will explain linear and nonlinear methods for dimension reduction; linear methods reduce dimension through the use of linear combinations of variables, and nonlinear methods do so with nonlinear functions of variables. We will also discuss the reduction of explanatory variables in regression analysis. Explanatory variables can be reduced with several linear combinations of explanatory variables. [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Exposures to {{dust mite}} and {{cockroach}} indoor allergens are important environmental risk factors in allergic sensitization {{and the development}} and exacerbation of asthma. To determine the relationship of indoor allergen levels and residence characteristics, dust samples were collected from indoor surfaces in residences in the Birmingham, Alabama area. The dust samples were analyzed for specific dust mite (Der p 1 and Der f 1) and cockroach (Bla g 1) antigens, the results of which were used to represent the level of indoor allergen present in each residence. The presence, {{and in some cases}} the degree, of potential allergen-predicting characteristics of each residence were visually inspected and recorded on a checklist inspection sheet by trained inspectors. These determinants were studied by multivariate stepwise regression analysis. The results did not show any of the visually inspected residence characteristics to be significantly (α= 0. 05) related to dust mite allergen levels. The results did show the “Level of food/debris? ” and “Evidence of roaches or rodents? ” <b>inspection</b> <b>items</b> to be significantly related to cockroach allergen levels from kitchen floor dust. This relationship accounted for 30 % of the variability in the allergen sample results. The results of this study and similar studies suggest that visually inspected residence characteristics may not be a good indication of the level of indoor allergens. Additional residence characteristics that could be determined by environmental conditions ii monitoring, historical information from residents, or owners and more intrusive investigation methods may be necessary to more accurately predict indoor allergen levels. iii ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to think the members of my committee at University of Alabama a...|$|E

The presence of measurement errors forces to set test limits which are slightly more strict. It {{is important to}} make this choice accurately: test limits which are too strict cause unnecessary loss of yield, whereas choices which are too liberal lead to consumer losses exceeding prescribed bounds. From earlier work, such accurate test limits are available. Using rather elaborate corrections, these limits have also been adapted to the often more realistic case where (some of) the underlying parameters need to be estimated. In this paper it is investigated how well such corrections can be achieved using the bootstrap method instead...|$|R

40|$|The DER-rating {{method has}} been adopted as the {{national}} standard for the rating of road structures. This method is defects-based and involves the rating of defects on the various inspections items of road structures in terms of degree (D), extent (E) and relevancy (R) rating. The DER-rating method has {{been included in the}} Draft TMH 19 Manual for the Visual Assessment of Road Structures. The D, E, and R ratings are used to calculate condition indices for road structures. The method used is a deduct-points approach, similar to what is recommended in the Draft TMH 22 Road Asset Management Systems Manual for calculating different condition and need indices for road pavements. This paper describes the procedure to arrive at a Priority Condition Index (PCI) that identifies those structures with critical defects that should receive urgent attention, using the D, E and R ratings allocated to defects during the visual assessment of the structure. For road structures, defects are identified per inspection sub-item and the worst defect on a sub-item is rated, which then becomes the rating for that inspection sub-item. The sub-item DER ratings are used as input to calculate deduct points for the sub-item. These sub-item deduct points are then used as input to calculate a PCI for the sub-item. The worst sub-item PCI value determines the condition index for an inspection item. Finally, the condition indices of the <b>inspection</b> <b>items</b> are used to calculate the PCI for the whole structure. The PCI value ranges from 0 (worst condition) to 100 (best condition). The structure?s PCI determines what condition category the structure falls in. Five condition categories, namely ?Critical?; ?Poor?, ?Fair?, ?Good?; or ?Very Good?, are used.

5000|$|The {{accident}} {{flight was}} the first flight following maintenance that included flight control cable rigging. The flight was also intended to provide cockpit familiarization for the first officer and the pilot observer, and as a training flight for the first officer. About one minute after takeoff, the first officer contacted the tower and stated {{that they needed to}} return to land. The airplane impacted a cornfield about one mile southwest of the approach end of the runway, and 2 minutes 40 seconds after the initiation of the takeoff roll. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) indicated that, during the flight, neither the captain nor the first officer called for the landing gear to be raised, the flaps to be retracted, or the power levers to be reduced from full power. From the time the first officer called [...] "rotate" [...] until the impact, the captain repeated the word [...] "pull" [...] about 27 times. When the observer pilot asked, [...] "Come back on the trim?" [...] the captain responded, [...] "There's nothing anymore on the trim." [...] The inspection of the airplane revealed that the elevator trim cables were rigged improperly, which resulted in the trim cables being reversed. As a result, when the pilot applied nose-up trim, the elevator trim system actually applied nose-down trim. An examination of the maintenance instruction cards used to conduct the last inspection revealed that the inspector's block on numerous checks were not signed off by the Required <b>Inspection</b> <b>Item</b> (RII) inspector. The RII inspector did not sign the item that stated: [...] "Connect elevator servo trim tab cables and rig in accordance with Allison Convair manual...” The item had been signed off by the mechanic, but not by the RII inspector.

40|$|If {{and when}} search {{involves}} the serial <b>inspection</b> of <b>items</b> by covert or overt attention, its efficiency would {{be enhanced by}} a mechanism that would discourage re-inspections of items or regions of the display {{that had already been}} examined.

IOR was observed when search was most efficient (static and slower dynamic search). IOR was not observed when search performance was less efficient (fast dynamic search).

For search items defined by motion and shape there is strong support for prior grouping (Kingstone and Bischof, 1999). The present study tested for grouping based on inter-item shape symmetry. Results showed that target–distractor symmetry strongly influenced search whereas distractor–distractor symmetry influenced search more weakly. This indicates that static shapes are evaluated for similarity to one another prior to their explicit identification as ‘target’ or ‘distractor’. Possible reasons for the unequal contributions of target–distractor and distractor– distractor relations are discussed...|$|R
