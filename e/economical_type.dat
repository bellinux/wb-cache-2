40|$|Concrete sensors, {{which are}} {{manufactured}} by mixing conductive fibres (such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs)) with concrete, {{are one of}} the most significant and <b>economical</b> <b>types</b> of sensor. Two main factors affecting the performance of concrete sensors are the amount of CNTs and the quality of their dispersion in the mixture with regard to the combined effects of the surfactant composition and CNTs dispersed with different levels of energy. The goal of this research was to evaluate the effects of the main parameters affecting concrete sensor performance using various criteria (sensitivity of the sensor, standard deviation of the prediction error, repeatability, cross-correlation and hysteresis) in both static and dynamic loading regimes. Dynamic criteria such as sensitivity, internal repeatability, cross-correlation and hysteresis showed that the energy levels for the dispersion of CNTs have a greater effect on improving sensor performance than the amount of CNTs. On the contrary, the repeatability indicated that the amount of CNTs has a greater effect on sensor performance than the dispersion quality (energy level) of the CNTs. On the whole, the sensor produced with 0 · 15 wt% (by weight of cement) CNTs, superplasticiser and sodium dodecyl sulfate as a surfactant using the maximum energy level (ultrasonic bath for 2 h and 90 min of probe's ultrasonication) offered the best performance both in the static and dynamic load regimes...|$|R

30|$|Kaneko et al. [166] {{suggested}} that the link between stride rate and economy {{may be associated with}} muscle fiber recruitment. At slower stride rates (and longer stride lengths), the muscles need to develop relatively high external power during propulsion to overcome large braking forces. Conversely at fast strides rates (short stride lengths), the mechanical power associated with moving the limbs increases due to increased frequency of reciprocal movements. They indicated that these extreme conditions may require a greater reliance on less <b>economical</b> <b>Type</b> II fibers than more intermediate stride rate/stride length combinations [166]. Consequently, efforts to improve RE via stride rate manipulation would be ineffective, unless the runner’s freely chosen stride rate is not economically optimal [69].

The experimental results are presented and the global behaviors of the tested columns are discussed, particularly focusing on stiffness and strength degradations due to increasing cyclic demand. Test results indicated superior damage tolerance and stable inelastic load-displacement responses up to 5 % or 9 % drift for the HPFRCC columns, even though they suffered severe shear cracks.
