40|$|In a {{homogeneous}} and isotropic universe with nonzero spatial curvature {{we consider the}} effects of gravitational particle production in {{the dynamics of the}} universe. We show that the dynamics of the universe in such a background is characterized by a single nonlinear differential equation which is significantly dependent on the rate of particle creation and whose solutions can be dominated by the curvature effects at early times. For different particle creation rates we apply the singularity test in order to find the analytic solutions of the background dynamics. We describe the behavior of the cosmological solutions for both open and closed universes. We also show how the effects of curvature can be produced by the presence of a second perfect fluid with an appropriate equation of state. By combining that result with the analysis of the critical points we find that our consideration can be related with the preinflationary era. Specifically we find that for negative spatial curvature small changes of the Milne spacetime leads to a de Sitter universe. AP acknowledges the financial support of FONDECYT grant no. 3160121.

40|$|South Africa’s {{welfare system}} is {{exceptional}} amongst middle-income {{and developing countries}} (Seekings, 2005 b). It provides generous means-tested noncontributory old-age pensions for the elderly, disability grants for those too ill or incapacitated to work, and child support grants for the care-givers of children. Approximately 10 million social grants are paid out each month, amounting to about 3 % of the Gross Domestic Product. But despite this relatively generous level of social assistance, pressure on the welfare system continues to grow – most notably on disability grants which rose from about 600, 000 in 2000 to almost 1. 3 million in 2004 (see also Nattrass, 2006). This is in part {{a consequence of the}} Aids epidemic. As can be seen in Figure 1, South Africa {{has one of the highest}} rates of HIV infection in the world.
