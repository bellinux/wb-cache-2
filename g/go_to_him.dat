He could only follow parts of Hambleton's weak transmissions but knew he would have to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> North Vietnamese tanks were spotted at the Cam Lo bridge, and air strikes were carried out to destroy them before the team launched their second rescue mission. The NVA fixed the location of the outpost and poured mortar and artillery fire on the forward ARVN outpost, killing two of the five remaining ARVN Seals. The wounded were evacuated the next morning.|$|E

25|$|Goldsmith {{defeated}} the Liberal Democrat MP Susan Kramer in Richmond Park at the 2010 general election; {{he saw a}} 7% swing in the vote <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> The election resulted in a hung parliament {{and the formation of}} a coalition government led by Cameron and the Conservatives. At the next general election, in May 2015, he increased his majority from 4,091 to 23,015 votes. He achieved an increase of 8.5 percent of the share of the vote from the 2010 general election, receiving a total of 58.2 percent of all votes cast by his constituents. This was the biggest increase in majority of any MP at the 2015 general election.|$|E

500|$|He {{returned}} to his pre-war clerical job at the Sydney Town Hall, but soon switched to a job with motor parts distributor Stack & Company, which allowed him more time for cricket commitments. Morris was automatically restored to the Sheffield Shield team in 1946–47 upon the resumption of competition. He made 27 and 98 in his first match against Queensland, and was selected for an Australian XI match against Wally Hammond's touring MCC team when first-choice opener Bill Brown was injured. In what was effectively a trial for the Test team, Morris scored 115 and featured in a 196-run partnership with Test captain Don Bradman, who scored 106. It was {{the beginnings of a}} productive cricketing relationship. Morris said of Bradman: [...] "He was marvellous. If you had a problem, you could <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and sort it out. I found him relaxed and straightforward".|$|E

The wheels in Hazel's head begin unaccustomed turnings, and {{sometime}} later when Mac passes Hazel on the street, Mac is surprised to see his friend carrying a baseball bat. When the scene returns to Doc's lab, he is receiving treatment from a real doctor and trying to puzzle out how he broke his arm. Suzy comes in, and makes soup for him as Hazel and Mac take turns watching at the keyhole. Doc admits that he needs and loves Suzy, and they embrace. As Fauna and the girls arrive, so do the other Flophouse boys, and Mac gives Doc what was bought with the raffle money—the largest (tele)scope in the catalog. ("Finale") ...|$|E

500|$|The {{scrutiny}} {{phase of}} the election is as follows: The cardinal electors proceed, in order of precedence, to take their completed ballots (which bear only {{the name of the}} individual voted for) to the altar, where the Scrutineers stand. Before casting the ballot, each cardinal elector takes a Latin oath, which translates to: [...] "I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge, that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected." [...] If any cardinal elector is in the Chapel, but cannot proceed to the altar due to infirmity, the last Scrutineer may <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and take his ballot after the oath is recited. If any cardinal elector is by reason of infirmity confined to his room, the Infirmarii go to their rooms with ballot papers and a box. Any such sick cardinals take the oath and then complete the ballot papers. When the Infirmarii return to the Chapel, the ballots are counted to ensure that their number matches with the number of ill cardinals; thereafter, they are deposited in the appropriate receptacle. This oath is taken by all cardinals as they cast their ballots. If no one is chosen on the first scrutiny, then a second scrutiny immediately follows. A maximum total of four scrutinies can be taken each day, two in the morning and two in the afternoon.|$|E

Kelly ended up giving the song to her, which resulted in Monica thanking him [...] "from the bottom of [...] heart".

2500|$|Rogers {{was the son}} of a {{deceased}} [...] millionaire, Colonel Henry Huddleston Rogers, a former Standard Oil executive. Colonel Rogers made millions in oil, together with the family of John D. Rockefeller, from the resources of the huge estate. The elder Rogers left virtually his entire inheritance to his wife, a daughter, and to a son from his daughter's first marriage. The residuary estate was left for the wife, daughter, and daughter's son to share equally. Henry H. Rogers III was excluded from the provisions of his father's will through the careful wording of lawyers. He lived on $500,000 annually from a trust fund provided by his father's will. The income was to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> during his lifetime but would return to the estate when he died.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 August 2008, Lampard {{signed a}} new five-year {{contract}} with Chelsea worth £39.2million, {{making him the}} highest-paid Premier League player. He started the 2008–09 season by scoring five goals in his first eleven league matches. He scored the 150th goal of his club career with a goal against Manchester City in the Premier League. In October 2008, in the Premier League he scored a chipped goal against Hull City with his left foot; he unleashed a chip from 20 yards that curled and swerved and fooled the goalkeeper as it went into the net. FIFA World Cup-winning coach Luiz Felipe Scolari said after the game, [...] "It was the best goal I have seen, my vote for World Player {{of the year award}} will <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> only a player with his intelligence could have done that." [...] Lampard scored his hundredth career Premier League goal in a 5–0 victory over Sunderland on 2 November. Eighteen of Lampard's hundred goals were penalties. He was named Premier League Player of the Month {{for the third time in}} his career in October.|$|E

2500|$|To {{begin the}} fourth quarter, the Texas Tech defense forced a Nebraska fourth down and 1 in field goal range. The Cornhuskers {{brought out the}} kicker but faked the field goal and passed for a first down to the 1-yard line. Nebraska's Joe Ganz then scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to pull Nebraska within 7 points with 12:10 {{remaining}} in the fourth quarter. After a Red Raider punt, the Cornhuskers once again drove the field and scored on a Ganz 2-yard pass to Dreu Young {{to tie the game}} at 2424. On the very next drive by Texas Tech, the Cornhuskers forced the Red Raiders to a fourth down with 5 yards to go on Texas Tech's own 36-yard line. Mike Leach decided to go for it, and Harrell found Crabtree again for a 47-yard reception keeping the drive alive. Harrell later said of the play, [...] "If he was just a little covered, I would <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> I threw it up there and he made the play." [...] A few plays later, Harrell scored on a 1-yard run to give the Red Raiders the lead 3124. Nebraska then drove the field 79 yards in 8 plays and scored on a 17-yard pass from Ganz to Todd Peterson to tie the game at 31 a piece with 29 seconds remaining in the game. Texas Tech failed to score on the next drive and the game went into overtime.|$|E

2500|$|Responding to such {{criticism}} Popović said in early 1994: [...] "Well, I'm a lawyer, so technically yes, I am committing {{an act of}} treason under Serbian laws. But I distinguish between {{the interests of the}} Serbian state and the Serbian people and I think these interests are opposed at this moment. The military defeat of the Milošević government {{is in the best interest}} of the Serbian people. It is something that every good Serbian patriot should wish for. I don't think I betrayed my people". Pressed further to clarify his position on the ramifications of such an act such as an implication that a violent foreign intervention can solve certain political problems, like the problem of an armed Serb secession from Bosnia-Herzegovina, or from Croatia, as well as his position on the inevitable civilian death toll if such an action is to occur, Popović said: [...] "I think that's an unfair question. If I see somebody trying to murder somebody else, of course my duty is to try to stop him. I'm not saying that by doing so and applying violence to the situation, I'm actually trying to help those people lead a good life. I don't know what they will do once they leave the scene. What I see Serbs doing in Bosnia is committing an act of aggression against a state that has been recognized by United Nations, and I see them committing genocide. I think that both of these things should be stopped. Of course, stopping it would not solve the problem of how these people will live next to each other in the future, but first you have to stop the crimes. The international community has an obligation to do so, under the Genocide Convention and the United Nations Charter. They have an obligation to use force to stop aggression, and to stop genocide. In any armed conflict there will be civilian casualties. Unfortunately, that's something that can't be avoided. But I don't think that this fact should prevent the international community from doing what they are obliged to do under the international law: stopping the aggression, stopping the genocide. It sounds nice to advocate peaceful means, but it is not realistic. I return to this parallel: If you see some big guy beating a kid in the street, it would be very good if you could <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>him</b> and say 'Please stop this, you shouldn't be doing this, it is uncivilized. This poor guy cannot defend himself.' No, if that doesn't work, you call the police, who have to use violence. At this point in history you have to revert to violence to stop crime." [...] Asked whether he signed the particular petition because of the circumstances rather than principally thinking that such measures solve problems, Popović said: [...] "I'll go even further. I signed this document knowing perfectly well that this will never happen. I did it as a gesture to show that I realized who's the main culprit in the Yugoslav conflict. And I wanted to express my opinion that this government would deserve it, even though it will never happen".|$|E
