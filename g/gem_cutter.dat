2500|$|Gems {{were mostly}} cut by using {{abrasive}} powder from harder stones {{in conjunction with}} a hand-drill, probably often set in a lathe. Emery has been mined for abrasive powder on Naxos since antiquity. [...] Some early types of seal were cut by hand, rather than a drill, which does not allow fine detail. There is no evidence that magnifying lenses were used by <b>gem</b> <b>cutters</b> in antiquity. A medieval guide to gem-carving techniques survives from Theophilus Presbyter. Byzantine cutters used a flat-edged wheel on a drill for intaglio work, while Carolingian ones used round-tipped drills; it is unclear where they learnt this technique from. In intaglio gems at least, the recessed cut surface is usually very well preserved, and microscopic examination is revealing of the technique used. The colour of several gemstones can be enhanced by a number of artificial methods, using heat, sugar and dyes. Many of these can be shown to have been used since antiquity – since the 7th millennium BC in the case of heating.|$|R

40|$|Bohemian Baroque Cut Glass Bohemian Baroque {{cut glass}} {{dates back to}} the reign of Rudolph II., when {{numerous}} artists came to Prague including <b>gem</b> <b>cutters</b> and, later on, also glassmakers such as Caspar Lehmann. The promising development was interrupted by the Thirty Years' War. However, that was followed by a prosperous period and advances in perfecting the glass, which {{came to be known as}} "Bohemian crystal" due to its properties that were similar to rock crystal produced at an earlier time. Bohemian crystal triggered a development in engraving and cutting techniques for which it was suitable due to its unusual hardness, and soon the Bohemian cut glass attained an exquisite quality. The development of Bohemian glassmaking was also influenced by other countries with their own specific glass production, such as Italy and Germany. The products, which were purely status symbols at first, gradually became popular and reached the wider public. The motifs of the Bohemian Baroque cut glass came primarily from graphic works and coins, and were further influenced by the style of the time and clients' wishes. Two regions with the highest concentration of glassworks gradually developed in the lands of the Bohemian Crown. The first was South Bohemia and the second North Bohemia, which also became a centre for [...] ...|$|R
50|$|Heat {{can improve}} {{gemstone}} color or clarity. The heating {{process has been}} well known to <b>gem</b> miners and <b>cutters</b> for centuries, and in many stone types heating is a common practice. Most citrine is made by heating amethyst, and partial heating with a strong gradient results in ametrine—a stone partly amethyst and partly citrine. Much aquamarine is heated to remove yellow tones and change the green color into the more desirable blue or enhance its existing blue color to a purer blue.|$|R
50|$|With {{the opening}} of the Nahe Valley Railway (Bingen-Saarbrücken) in 1860 - single-tracked until 1882 - came {{transport}} links for the first time between the Nahe Valley and both the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region and the Saarland. In 1880, Sonnenberg station came into service, whereupon many Frauenbergers found work in Idar-Oberstein, the Saarland and the Frankfurt Rhine Main Region. This also brought about population growth: by 1910 there were 51 families. After the First World War, electricity came to Frauenberg, allowing many agate, <b>gem</b> and diamond <b>cutters</b> to set up their workshops at home.|$|R

5000|$|In Alexander's entourage {{were three}} artists: Lysippus the sculptor, Apelles the painter, and Pyrgoteles the <b>gem</b> <b>cutter</b> and engraver. [...] The period {{after his death}} was one of great {{prosperity}} and considerable extravagance {{for much of the}} Greek world, at least for the wealthy. Royalty became important patrons of art. Sculpture, painting and architecture thrived, but vase-painting ceased to be of great significance. Metalwork and a wide variety of luxury arts produced much fine art. Some types of popular art were increasingly sophisticated.|$|E
50|$|Bohemian glass, or Bohemia crystal, is a {{decorative}} glass produced in regions of Bohemia and Silesia, {{now in the}} current state of the Czech Republic, since the 13th century. Oldest archaeology excavations of glass-making sites date to around 1250 and are located in the Lusatian Mountains of Northern Bohemia. Most notable sites of glass-making throughout the ages are Skalice (Langenau), Kamenický Šenov (Steinschönau) and Nový Bor (Haida). Both Nový Bor and Kamenický Šenov have their own Glass Museums with many items dating since around 1600. It was especially outstanding in its manufacture of glass in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750. In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, <b>gem</b> <b>cutter</b> to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels.|$|E
50|$|Bohemian glass-workers {{discovered}} potash {{combined with}} chalk created a clear colourless glass {{that was more}} stable than glass from Italy. In the 16th century the term Bohemian crystal emerged {{for the first time}} in history to distinguish its qualities from the glass coming from other places. This glass contained no lead as is commonly suspected. This Czech glass could be cut with a wheel. In addition, resources such as wood for firing the kilns and for burning down to ashes were used to create potash. There were also copious amounts of limestone and silica. In the 17th century, Caspar Lehmann, <b>gem</b> <b>cutter</b> to Emperor Rudolf II in Prague, adapted to glass the technique of gem engraving with copper and bronze wheels. During the era, the Czech lands became the dominant producer of decorative glassware and the local manufacture of glass earned international reputation in high Baroque style from 1685 to 1750.|$|E
5000|$|The Light of the Desert is a {{cerussite}} gem in the Royal Ontario Museum's collection. It is the world’s largest faceted {{example of}} cerussite, weighing 898 carats (6.3 ounces). [...] The word “cerussite” {{comes from the}} Latin meaning “white lead”; the mineral is a lead carbonate with the chemical formula of PbCO3.The raw cerussite was discovered in Tsumeb in northern Namibia and acquired by a <b>gem</b> <b>cutter</b> from Arizona who then cut the raw material into the gem on display. The cutting and transport of this gem is a delicate business as cerussite is extremely fragile and sensitive to changes in temperature changes and vibration. After it was cut in Arizona, the gem {{was placed in a}} box, then wrapped in a large woolen scarf and a winter vest, and then hand transported to Toronto for display. Cerussite is too fragile to ever be set in jewelry.|$|E
5000|$|On 7 January 2010, it was {{reported}} that the diamond had been recut to enhance the stone's colour and clarity, losing over 4.45 carat mg in the process. The resulting stone has been renamed the Wittelsbach-Graff. The move was met with heavy criticism by some experts: Gabriel Tolkowsky called it [...] "the end of culture." [...] Shortly after the auction of the diamond, American <b>gem</b> <b>cutter</b> and replicator of famous diamonds Scott Sucher stated, [...] "In the case of the Wittelsbach, what's at stake is at minimum over 350 years of history, as every nick, chip, and scratch has a story to tell. Just because we can't decipher these stories doesn't mean they don't exist." [...] The alteration of the historical stone has been compared by Professor Hans Ottomeyer, director of the Deutsches Historisches Museum of Berlin, to the overpainting of a painting by Rembrandt. It is opined that the recutting was done to increase its market value and, by extension, that of other [...] "fancy diamonds". As a result of the recut, which removed some chips and reduced the size of the culet by 40%, the gem has been re-evaluated by the Gemological Institute of America and its colour grade revised from [...] "fancy deep grayish-blue", the same grade given by GIA to The Hope, to the more desirable [...] "fancy deep blue". The diamond's clarity had also been revised upward from [...] "very slightly included" [...] (VS1) to [...] "internally flawless" [...] (IF).|$|E
5000|$|As {{well as the}} {{operational}} requirements, it was envisaged that future application logic would likely be written for a dynamic platform (such as Java or [...]Net), and therefore {{it was determined that}} the Quark Framework should be native to Java (initially) with considerable emphasis on performance and interoperability with application logic written on that platform. In 1999, work began in Crystal's Research Group on an implementation of this framework. Many of the original insights into lazy functional systems were drawn from implementations of Haskell. Early on, Haskell (HUGS, GHC) was even considered {{as a starting point for}} the implementation itself, but a number of requirements made this impractical, so it was decided to let the project emerge and evolve freely following its own design criteria. For the first few years of development, the CAL source language itself was not a primary motivator, but {{the operational}} semantics were of primary concern. At this time, CAL was merely a convenient script for expressing functions rather than composing them programmatically through Java APIs, or using a graphical language native to a tool called the <b>Gem</b> <b>Cutter,</b> which began to be implemented in mid-2000 as a way to author systems of functions that could be used in applications. From about 2002 onward, the CAL language became rather more central to the Quark Framework, especially once programmers began to create usable libraries of functions for real applications. As the language evolved, so did the demand for tools, and so a range of tools and utilities were created in parallel to language development to support those doing real work with the platform.|$|E
50|$|Meanwhile, Burman and Bose befriend Dr. Hajra, who is {{travelling}} on {{the same}} train but fails to recognise them. Dr. Hajra finds out that Mukul's father was a <b>gem</b> <b>cutter,</b> so the gems mentioned by Mukul {{have nothing to do}} with treasure, but Burman and Mandar Bose weren't aware of this. They come up with devious intentions to kill Dr. Hajra and pushes him off a cliff and kidnap Mukul at the first available opportunity which they get when Dr. Hajra thought of showing Mukul the Nahargarh Fort in Jaipur. From there on, Burman impersonates as Dr. Hazra and Mandar Bose as a globe-trotter. Unknown to them, Dr. Hajra survives the fall, though he is forced to rest for a few days to recover from his grievous injuries. Feluda arrives in Jodhpur Circuit House and meets Burman, thinking him to be Dr. Hajra, whereas Burman coming to know about Feluda's arrival gets disturbed and again plots to kill him using a poisonous scorpion, but fails. Jatayu joins them and they move around Rajasthan showing various forts to Mukul, but none of them fascinates Mukul as they were not his Golden Fortress. Meanwhile, Feluda starts to suspect Mandar Bose primarily based on his dressing and his affluent Bengali accent but later corroborated by his attempt to cover up an error committed in front of Jatayu, though he is not the last one as Feluda even suspects Dr Hajra's conduct as he appears lackadaisical in his endeavour. Feluda also determines to inquire Mukul the next morning about the mysterious bad man once narrated by Mukul. Feluda was convinced by then that everything was not true as it appeared, but then he still didn't have enough basis to work on any conclusion.|$|E
40|$|The <b>Gem</b> <b>Cutter</b> is a {{graphical}} {{tool for}} creating {{functions in the}} Haskell-like language CAL by snapping together previously created functions on a canvas known as the table-top. Our contribution is a new graphical model supporting the composition of higherorder functions, creation and use of local functions and variables, composable editors for editing values of possibly compound type, and incorporation of textual CAL expressions. The resulting graphical representation is powerful enough to express any CAL function, {{but at the same}} time uses few distinct kinds of graphical elements that are organized as a set of trees rather than a graph. The model is checked by the underlying functional compiler at each stage, ensuring that only valid operations are permitted. The <b>Gem</b> <b>Cutter</b> can suggest valid subsequent compositions to various degrees of granularity. Any part of the model can be run, with value entry for required arguments prompted for using the composable type-directed value editors...|$|E
40|$|The machineable {{representation}} {{and execution of}} clinical guidelines {{has been the focus}} of research efforts for some time, however there is less examination of whether the methods and techniques for guidelines are sufficient for clinical protocols. The objective of this study was to test the feasibility of using the Guideline Elements Model II (GEM II) and <b>GEM</b> <b>Cutter</b> for the representation of clinical protocols, specifically clinical protocols commonly used by nurses. After downloading the <b>GEM</b> <b>Cutter</b> 2. 5, we decomposed a set of clinical protocols and analyzed the completeness in which elemental protocol data was represented. One of the most complicated of these protocols (extravasations of infused medication) is presented as an example. While GEM II adequately represents core elements of clinical protocols at the high level, it was not possible to adequately represent sequence and associated role based permissions via use of conditional criteria at branching and procedural levels. Functionality of the tool would also be enhanced with more robust terminology management and support for multi-authoring...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Knowledge {{acquisition}} for {{the design}} of clinical decision support systems can be facilitated when clinical practice guidelines serve as a knowledge source. We have applied the Guideline Elements Model (GEM) in the design of a decision support system to promote smoking cessation. Following markup of knowledge components with the <b>GEM</b> <b>Cutter</b> editor, the Extractor stylesheet was used to create a list of decision variables and actions for further processing, including consolidation and atomization. Removing the critical concepts from the narrative text facilitates clarification of necessary content...|$|E
40|$|The Guideline Elements Model (GEM) was {{developed}} in 2000 to organize {{the information contained in}} clinical practice guidelines using XML and to represent guideline content in a form that can be understood by human readers and processed by computers. In this work, we systematically reviewed the literature to better understand how GEM was being used, potential barriers to its use, and suggestions for improvement. Fifty external and twelve internally produced publications were identified and analyzed. GEM was used most commonly for modeling and ontology creation. Other investigators applied GEM for knowledge extraction and data mining, for clinical decision support for guideline generation. The <b>GEM</b> <b>Cutter</b> software—used to markup guidelines for translation into XML— has been downloaded 563 times since 2000. Although many investigators found GEM to be valuable, others critiqued its failure to clarify guideline semantics, difficulties in markup, and the fact that GEM files are not usually executable...|$|E
