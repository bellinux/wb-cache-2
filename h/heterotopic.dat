25|$|Although rare, <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancies are {{becoming}} more common, likely due to increased use of IVF. The survival rate of the uterine fetus of a <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy is around 70%.|$|E
25|$|As the vitelline duct {{is made up}} of {{pluripotent}} cell lining, Meckel’s diverticulum may harbor abnormal tissues, containing embryonic remnants of other tissue types. Jejunal, duodenal mucosa or Brunner's tissue were each found in 2% of ectopic cases. <b>Heterotopic</b> rests of gastric mucosa and pancreatic tissue are seen in 60% and 6% of cases respectively. <b>Heterotopic</b> means the displacement of an organ from its normal anatomic location. Inflammation of this Meckel's diverticulum may mimic appendicitis. Therefore, during appendectomy, ileum should be checked for the presence of Meckel's diverticulum, if it is found to be present it should be removed along with appendix.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphogenetic}} {{movements of}} the PMCs are an autonomous cellular behavior. Experimentally grafting PMCs into <b>heterotopic</b> tissue does not prevent the cells from ingressing. In studies where PMCs are cultured in insolation, the cells were observed to gain affinity for fibronectin and simultaneously lose affinity for extraembryonic matrix, independent of the embryonic environment.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heterotopic</b> {{pregnancy}} is an exceedingly rare type of dizygotic twinning {{in which one}} twin implants in the uterus as normal and the other remains in the fallopian tube as an ectopic pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancies must be resolved {{because they can be}} life-threatening to the mother. However, in most cases, the intrauterine pregnancy can be salvaged.|$|E
25|$|From November 1974 through December 1983, forty-nine {{consecutive}} <b>heterotopic</b> heart transplants on 43 {{patients were}} performed at Groote Schuur. The survival rate for patients at one year was over 60%, {{as compared to}} less than 40% with standard transplants, and the survival rate at five years was over 36% as compared to less than 20% with standard transplants.|$|E
25|$|The tubers are {{typically}} triangular in configuration, with the apex pointed towards the ventricles, and {{are thought to}} represent foci of abnormal neuronal migration. The T2 signal abnormalities may subside in adulthood, but will still be visible on histopathological analysis. On magnetic resonance imaging, TSC patients can exhibit other signs consistent with abnormal neuron migration such as radial white matter tracts hyperintense on T2WI and <b>heterotopic</b> gray matter.|$|E
25|$|In {{rare cases}} of ectopic {{pregnancy}}, {{there may be}} two fertilized eggs, one outside the uterus and the other inside. This is called a <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy. Often the intrauterine pregnancy is discovered later than the ectopic, {{mainly because of the}} painful emergency nature of ectopic pregnancies. Since ectopic pregnancies are normally discovered and removed very early in the pregnancy, an ultrasound may not find the additional pregnancy inside the uterus. When hCG levels continue to rise after the removal of the ectopic pregnancy, there is the chance that a pregnancy inside the uterus is still viable. This is normally discovered through an ultrasound.|$|E
25|$|Classical lissencephaly, {{also known}} as type I or {{generalized}} agyria-pachygyria, is a severe brain malformation of a smooth cerebral surface, abnormally thick (10-20mm) cortex with four layers, widespread neuronal heterotopia, enlarged ventricles, and agenesis or malformation of the corpus callosum. Classical lissencephaly can range from agyria to regional pachygyria and is usually present along with subcortical band heterotopia (known as ‘double cortex’ to describe the circumferential bands of <b>heterotopic</b> neurons located beneath the cortex). Subcortical band heterotopia is a malformation slightly different from lissencephaly that is now classified under the agyria-pachygyria-band spectrum because it consists of a gyral pattern consistent with broad convolutions and an increased cortical thickness.|$|E
25|$|The precise {{treatment}} intent (curative, adjuvant, neoadjuvant therapeutic, or palliative) {{will depend}} on the tumor type, location, and stage, as well as the general health of the patient. Total body irradiation (TBI) is a radiation therapy technique used to prepare the body to receive a bone marrow transplant. Brachytherapy, in which a radioactive source is placed inside or next to the area requiring treatment, is another form of radiation therapy that minimizes exposure to healthy tissue during procedures to treat cancers of the breast, prostate and other organs. Radiation therapy has several applications in non-malignant conditions, such as the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia, acoustic neuromas, severe thyroid eye disease, pterygium, pigmented villonodular synovitis, and prevention of keloid scar growth, vascular restenosis, and <b>heterotopic</b> ossification. The use of radiation therapy in non-malignant conditions is limited partly by worries about the risk of radiation-induced cancers.|$|E

500|$|In {{the long}} term, {{the loss of}} muscle {{function}} can have additional effects from disuse, including atrophy of the muscle. [...] Immobility can lead to pressure sores, [...] particularly in bony areas, requiring precautions such as extra cushioning and turning in bed every two hours (in the acute setting) to relieve pressure. In the long term, people in wheelchairs must shift periodically to relieve pressure. [...] Another complication is pain, including nociceptive pain (indication of potential or actual tissue damage) and neuropathic pain, when [...] nerves affected by damage convey erroneous pain signals {{in the absence of}} noxious stimuli. Spasticity, the uncontrollable tensing of muscles below the level of injury, occurs in 65–78% of chronic SCI. It results from lack of input from the brain that quells muscle responses to stretch reflexes. [...] It can be treated with drugs and physical therapy. Spasticity increases the risk of contractures (shortening of muscles, tendons, or ligaments that result from lack of use of a limb); this problem can be prevented by moving the limb through its full range of motion multiple times a day. [...] Another problem lack of mobility can cause is loss of bone density and changes in bone structure. Loss of bone density (bone demineralization), thought to be due to lack of input from weakened or paralysed muscles, can increase the risk of fractures. Conversely, a poorly understood phenomenon is the overgrowth of bone tissue in soft tissue areas, [...] called <b>heterotopic</b> ossification. [...] It occurs below the level of injury, possibly as a result of inflammation, and happens to a clinically significant extent in 27% of people.|$|E
2500|$|Full {{recovery}} of donor heart function often takes place over hours or days, {{during which time}} considerable damage can occur. [...] Other deaths to patients can occur from preexisting conditions. [...] For example, in pulmonary hypertension the patient's right ventricle has often adapted to the higher pressure over time and, although diseased and hypertrophied, is often capable of maintaining circulation to the lungs. [...] Barnard designed {{the idea of the}} <b>heterotopic</b> (or [...] "piggy back" [...] transplant) in which the patient's diseased heart is left in place while the donor heart is added, essentially forming a [...] "double heart". [...] Barnard performed the first such <b>heterotopic</b> heart transplant in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|... 6.2% of IVF-conceived {{children}} had major defects, {{as compared with}} 4.4% of naturally conceived children matched for maternal age and other factors (odds ratio, 1.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.00 to 1.67). ART carries with it a risk for <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy (simultaneous intrauterine and extrauterine pregnancy).|$|E
2500|$|The {{combination}} of a positive pregnancy test {{and the presence of}} {{what appears to be a}} normal intrauterine pregnancy does not exclude an ectopic pregnancy, since there may be either a <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy or a [...] "", which is a collection of within the endometrial cavity that may be seen in up to 20% of women.|$|E
2500|$|A heart transplant, or {{a cardiac}} transplant, is a {{surgical}} transplant procedure performed on patients with end-stage heart failure or severe {{coronary artery disease}} when other medical or surgical treatments have failed. As of 2016, the most common procedure {{is to take a}} functioning heart (with or without transplantation of a lung or lungs; a cadaveric donor cardiectomy) from a recently deceased organ donor (the cadaveric allograft), and implant it into the patient. The patient's own heart is either removed (the cardiectomy for the recipient) and replaced with the donor heart (orthotopic procedure) or, much less commonly, the recipient's diseased heart is left in place to support the donor heart (<b>heterotopic,</b> or [...] "piggyback," [...] transplant procedure). [...] Approximately 3500 heart transplants are performed every year in the world, more than half of which occur in the US. Post-operation survival periods average 15 years. Heart transplantation is not considered to be a cure for heart disease, but a life-saving treatment intended {{to improve the quality of}} life for recipients.|$|E
50|$|<b>Heterotopic</b> {{ossification}} {{of varying}} severity {{can be caused}} by surgery or trauma to the hips and legs. About every third patient who has total hip arthroplasty (joint replacement) or a severe fracture of the long bones of the lower leg will develop <b>heterotopic</b> ossification, but is uncommonly symptomatic. Between 50% and 90% of patients who developed <b>heterotopic</b> ossification following a previous hip arthroplasty will develop additional <b>heterotopic</b> ossification.|$|E
50|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy {{is estimated at}} 0.6‑2.5:10,000 pregnancies. There is {{a significant increase in}} the incidence of <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy in women undergoing ovulation induction. An even greater incidence of <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy is reported in pregnancies following assisted reproduction techniques such as In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) and Gamete intrafallopian transfer (GIFT), with an estimated incidence at between 1 and 3 in 100 pregnancies. If there is embryo transfer of more than 4 embryos, the risk has been quoted as 1 in 45. In natural conceptions, the incidence of <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy has been estimated to be 1 in 30 000 pregnancies.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} rare genetic {{disorders}} causing <b>heterotopic</b> ossification such as fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), {{a condition that}} causes injured bodily tissues {{to be replaced by}} <b>heterotopic</b> bone. Characteristically exhibiting in the big toe at birth, it causes the formation of <b>heterotopic</b> bone throughout the body {{over the course of the}} sufferer's life, causing chronic pain and eventually leading to the immobilisation and fusion of most of the skeleton by abnormal growths of bone.|$|E
50|$|The only {{definitive}} {{diagnostic test}} in the early acute stage is a bone scan, which will show hetertopic ossification 7 - 10 days earlier than an x-ray. The three-phase bone scan {{may be the most}} sensitive method of detecting early <b>heterotopic</b> bone formation. However, an abnormality detected in the early phase may not progress to the formation of <b>heterotopic</b> bone. Another finding, often misinterpreted as early <b>heterotopic</b> bone formation, is an increased (early) uptake around the knees or the ankles in a patient with a very recent spinal cord injury. It is not clear exactly what this means, because these patients do not develop <b>heterotopic</b> bone formation. It has been hypothesized that this {{may be related to the}} autonomic nervous system and its control over circulation.|$|E

50|$|In {{the general}} population, the major {{risk factors for}} <b>heterotopic</b> {{pregnancy}} {{are the same as}} those for ectopic pregnancy. For women in an assisted reproductive program, there are additional factors: a higher incidence of multiple ovulation, a higher incidence of tubal malformation and/or tubal damage, and technical factors in embryo transfer which may increase the risk for ectopic and <b>heterotopic</b> pregnancy.|$|E

5000|$|Salivary gland heterotopia {{is where}} salivary gland acini cells {{are present in}} an {{abnormal}} location without any duct system. [...] The most common location is the cervical lymph nodes. Other reported sites of <b>heterotopic</b> salivary gland tissue are the middle ear, parathyroid glands, thyroid gland, pituitary gland, cerebellar pontine angle, soft tissue medial to sternocleidomastoid, stomach, rectum and vulva. Salivary gland neoplasm occurrence within <b>heterotopic</b> salivary gland tissue is rare.|$|E

50|$|In {{traumatic}} <b>heterotopic</b> ossification (traumatic myositis ossificans), {{the patient}} may complain of a warm, tender, firm swelling in a muscle and decreased {{range of motion}} in the joint served by the muscle involved. There is often a history of a blow or other trauma to the area {{a few weeks to}} a few months earlier. Patients with traumatic neurological injuries, severe neurologic disorders or severe burns who develop <b>heterotopic</b> ossification experience limitation of motion in the areas affected.|$|E
50|$|When {{the initial}} {{presentation}} is swelling and increased temperature in a leg, {{the differential diagnosis}} includes thrombophlebitis. It {{may be necessary to}} do both a bone scan and a venogram to differentiate between <b>heterotopic</b> ossification and thrombophlebitis, and it is even possible that both could be present simultaneously. In <b>heterotopic</b> ossification, the swelling tends to be more proximal and localized, with little or no foot/ankle edema, whereas in thrombophlebitis the swelling is usually more uniform throughout the leg.|$|E
