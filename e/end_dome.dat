40|$|MetPreg ™ is a {{technology}} in which fiber reinforced metals are produced using all the traditional composite processing {{techniques such as}} pultrusion, filament winding, tape placement, hot pressing, and vacuum bagging. This work is significant for applications where the high specific properties and temperature capability of metal matrix composites provide benefits over conventional monolithic metals and organic composites. Touchstone’s metal matrix composite (MMC) technology has advanced significantly {{in the area of}} filament winding. Hydrostatic burst testing has been conducted on cylinders produced with both hoop and helical plies under conditions that produce a biaxial stress state in the cylinder wall. This testing will lead to the development and refinement of predictive models {{that can be used for}} designing optimized pressure vessels and other types of containers. For example, the combination of high strength and low permeability of MMC materials makes them good candidates for storing hydrogen for the new hydrogen-based economy.

40|$|NASA's Constellation Architecture Team defined an outpost {{scenario}} {{optimized for}} intensive mobility that uses small, highly mobile pressurized rovers supported by portable habitat modules {{that can be}} carried between locations of interest on the lunar surface. A compact vertical cylinder characterizes the habitat concept, where the large diameter maximizes usable flat floor area optimized for a gravity environment and allows for efficient internal layout. The module was sized to fit into payload fairings for the Constellation Ares V launch vehicle, and optimized for surface transport carried by the All-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial Explorer (ATHLETE) mobility system. Launch and other loads are carried through the barrel to a top and bottom truss that interfaces with a structural support unit (SSU). The SSU contains self-leveling feet and docking interfaces for Tri-ATHLETE grasping and heavy lift. A pressurized module needed to be created that was appropriate for the lunar environment, could be easily relocated to new locations, and could be docked together in multiples for expanding pressurized volume in a lunar outpost. It was determined that horizontally oriented pressure vessels did not optimize floor area, which {{takes advantage of the}} gravity vector for full use. Hybrid hard-inflatable habitats added an unproven degree of complexity that may eventually be worked out. Other versions of vertically oriented pressure vessels were either too big, bulky, or did not optimize floor area. The purpose of the HDU vertical habitat module is to provide pressurized units that can be docked together in a modular way for lunar outpost pressurized volume expansion, and allow for other vehicles, rovers, and modules to be attached to the outpost to allow for IVA (intra-vehicular activity) transfer between them. The module is a vertically oriented cylinder with a large radius to allow for maximal floor area and use of volume. The modular, 5 - m-diameter HDU vertical habitat module consists of a 2 -m-high barrel with 0. 6 -mhigh <b>end</b> <b>domes</b> forming the 56 -cubicmeter pressure vessel, and a 19 -squaremeter floor area. The module has up to four docking ports located orthogonally from each other around the perimeter, and up to one docking port each on the top or bottom <b>end</b> <b>domes.</b> In addition, the module has mounting trusses top and bottom for equipment, and to allow docking with the ATHLETE mobility system. Novel or unique features of the HDU vertical habitat module include the nodelike function with multiple pressure hatches for docking with other versions of itself and other modules and vehicles; the capacity to be carried by an ATHLETE mobility system; and the ability to attach inflatable 'attic' domes to the top for additional pressurized volume...|$|R

40|$|M. Ing. Safety {{within the}} mining {{industry}} is a primary concern for everyone involved. More specifically, active below-ground stope support for South African Mines is becoming increasingly important due to a renewed emphasis on the safety and well-being of the people actually working underground. It is imperative that all stope support systems are rigorously tested, continuously, both under laboratory conditions and in-situ to prove their performance and manufacturing standards. The Rocprop was initially manufactured in 1995 with the first two hundred props being installed at East Driefontein Consolidated Gold Mine in the Carletonville area. In the three years since the first introduction over three hundred thousand Rocprops have been manufactured and sold to South African Mines with the number steadily increasing. The Rocprop is a tubular support consisting of two tubes — a Ø 139 mm 'inner' tube and a Ø 152 mm 'outer' tube. One end of each tube is sealed by <b>dome</b> <b>ends</b> which are welded onto the tube mouths. The two tubes, cut to identical lengths, fit inside one another and extend telescopically during installation. Once the desired height has been reached, leaving enough tube overlapping to ensure the support does not buckle, the wedge is hammered in locking the prop at that height. The water is then removed after which the prop will provide active support of the rock mass above it. One of the components responsible for the Rocprops success is a <b>dome</b> <b>end.</b> This is either a forging or a pressing welded onto {{each end of the}} support and allows continual concentric loading throughout the life of the Rocprop. At present the <b>dome</b> <b>ends</b> are pressings, manufactured into hemispheres from 10 mm mild steel plate in one action. The reason for the Rocprop's success is its performance characteristics. It's all metal construction, ease of installation, reliability and predictability in both seismic and static conditions, fire resistance, blast resistant, economically viability and versatility have made the prop successful. Reasons for the research were to investigate the <b>dome</b> <b>end</b> forming process in general and to investigate current numerical analysis techniques ability to predict loads during manufacture, the final shape, spring-back and other local deformation areas. Also to investigate alternate manufacturing methods such as cold forming, which provides advantages such as better mechanical properties and higher structural capabilities. The use of alternate materials in the Rocprop manufacture has been an ongoing process for MSP, manufacturer and current licensee holder of the Rocprop. A substitute for the current <b>dome</b> <b>end</b> manufactured from mild steel was investigated. For the substitute to be viable the material should be stronger, weigh less and be cost effective. In depth knowledge about the forming of the <b>dome</b> <b>end</b> at various velocities was gathered, providing information for further optimisation of the component...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing of single-piece <b>end</b> <b>domes</b> for {{cryogenic}} tanks employing {{spin forming}} of tailored, friction-stir-welded blanks of Al-Li alloy 2195 plate offers cost and reliability benefits. The introduction of plastic deformation into a friction stir weld {{is a unique}} feature of the proposed manufacturing route. This investigation addressed abnormal grain growth [AGG] within the friction stir weldments during postfabrication processing of a prototype dome. The phenomenon of AGG was observed during the solution heat treatment [SHT] phase of T 8 tempering and {{is a major concern}} for meeting specifications. Such abrupt microstructural transitions can be detrimental to notch-sensitive mechanical properties, such as ductility and/or fracture toughness. If the issue of AGG cannot be resolved, then the acceptance of this approach as a viable manufacturing route may be in jeopardy. The innovative approach adopted in this investigation was the insertion of a stand-alone, Intermediate Annealing Treatment [IAT] between the spin forming and T 8 processing operations. A simple, recovery annealing step was deemed to be the most readily-scalable solution when fabricating thin-walled, ellipsoidal domes. The research effort culminated in the development of an effective IAT, which resulted in a significant decrease in AGG following SHT. The processing philosophy adopted in designing the IAT is outlined and the microstructural reasons for success are discussed. The analytical results presented are consistent with promoting continuous grain growth during the IAT, thereby suppressing AGG during the SHT...|$|R

40|$|Calculation of the {{swept volume}} of a cutter {{is the heart}} of any {{numerical}} controlled (NC) simulation system. In NC machining, a wide variety of cutter shapes are used such as flat <b>end</b> mills, <b>dome</b> <b>end</b> mills, ball nose end mills, angle cutters, face mills and side-and-face cutters. There are also many types of cutter paths along which the cutter is guided by the NC controller: rapid motion, linear motion and circular motion are the most commonly used cutter paths among them. Furthermore, the kinematics of the NC machines also differ leading to 2. 5 -axis, 3 -axis and a variety of 5 -axis configurations. The swept volume algorithms {{have to take into account}} all these variations of cutter shapes, motion types and machine kinematics. In this paper, first the parametric definition of a generic cutter is presented that can emulate all types of cutter shapes. Subsequently, the motions are classified into six types considering the cutter path and kinematic variations for ease of swept volume calculations.
