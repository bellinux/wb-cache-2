50|$|EURECA {{was made}} of {{high-strength}} carbon-fiber struts and titanium nodal points joined {{together to form a}} framework of cubic elements. Thermal control on EURECA combined both active and passive heat transfer and radiation systems. Active heat transfer was achieved by means of a <b>freon</b> <b>cooling</b> loop which dissipated the thermal load through two radiators into space. The passive system made use of multilayer insulation blankets combined with electrical heaters.|$|E

The system demonstrates the feasibility of a functional scope of expert diagnostic systems {{which appears to be}} essential for practical applications of such systems in space technology. The scope includes early warning and treatment of incomplete information, fault tolerance, identification of failure superpositions, intelligent reaction to unforeseen events, and detailed status display for optimal recovery action...|$|E

50|$|The first {{member of}} the CDC 6000 series was the first {{supercomputer}} CDC 6600, designed by Seymour Cray and James E. Thornton in Chippewa Falls, Wisconsin. It was introduced in September 1964 and performed up to three million instructions per second, three {{times faster than the}} IBM Stretch, the speed champion for the previous couple of years. It remained the fastest machine for five years until the CDC 7600 was launched. The machine was <b>Freon</b> refrigerant <b>cooled.</b> Control Data manufactured about 100 machines of this type, selling for $6 to $10 million each.|$|R
40|$|The common ways {{used to find}} leak include {{traditional}} bubbling test, ultrasonic positioning and helium mass-spectrometer detection, etc. However, each of {{them has}} deficiencies of varying degrees, especially low-efficiency in bubbling and mass spectrometry means and poor anti-jamming capability in ultrasonic means. In order to search a better approach to do this job, a new method is introduced in this paper, {{which is based on}} infrared thermography. In the experiment, test vessel is firstly aerated with absolute pressure of 0. 6 - 0. 7 Mpa and then the temperature field surround the vessel is monitored and acquired by an IR camera. On account of leakiness, compressed air expanses from the leak hole to ambient and heat-absorption effect has taken place around it on the basis of Joule-Thomson Effect, so the temperature difference between the leak area and normal area will be reflected in the thermal images. Moreover, <b>Freon</b> <b>cooler</b> is also set in the pneumatic circuit for the sake of enhancing the phenomenon. During the test, several frames of thermal images in time sequence are transferred to the computer for pre-processing and fusion operating by the use of local entropy difference algorithm. From results, it is shown that the method achieves a good resolution and sensitivity in the application of air-leakage detection and localization. Some modeling and simulating work by finite element analysis is also carried out in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The basic aim of {{the task}} is to compile a {{temperature}} stratification system in an accumulation tank. The range of the thesis concerns {{the shape and dimensions}} of a stratification system for an accumulation tank. Thermal stratification is a process that comprises the maintaining of temperature stratification at different levels of an accumulation tank which reduce to a minimum the process of temperature equalization. It results {{from the fact that the}} thermal stratification in a tank significantly increases the installation efficiency and improves the process of energy storing. It is connected with a thermodynamic element quality, that is the higher the temperature, the higher the energy, and, thus, the thermos-dynamic element quality. In this phenomenon, thanks to the same amount of accumulated thermal energy and average temperature, as in a fully mixed tank, the user has a higher temperature in the upper part of the tank at his disposal. It has significant importance in the case when there is a low-temperature heating medium that transfers heat to the accumulation tank. Such a situation occurs when heat is absorbed from synthetic <b>freons</b> used in <b>cooling</b> and air-conditioning systems...|$|R
