40|$|International audienceAchieving {{reliable}} communication of critical data on mobile ad hoc networks {{is a must}} before MANETs can be considered practical for standard mobile and vehicular commu- nications. This paper thus focuses on schemes that complement existing ad hoc broadcast mechanisms (inherently unreliable), which can guarantee the full diffusion of critical messages, when necessary. An interesting approach in this domain {{is the use of}} an overlay network, over which critical messages are acknowledged peer to peer, in order to verify the actual dissemination. This paper elaborates on the problem of performance, related to the discovery and the maintenance of such an overlay network, in a mobile ad hoc context. We present an analysis of a novel algorithm, SLOT (<b>Synchronized</b> <b>Link</b> Overlay - Triangular), an overlay selected based on a Relative Neighborhood Graph (RNG) scheme, and we compare its performance with that of other existing algorithms, {{in the context of the}} industry-standard IP routing protocol OSPF, which uses alternative overlay algorithms to <b>synchronize</b> <b>link</b> state databases of routers. The results presented in this paper show that SLOT outperforms other existing overlays by necessitating drastically less control traffic in order to function, enabling OSPF to scale to larger mobile ad hoc topologies...|$|R

To utilize those two types of learning resources, on-demand materials and asynchronous interactions, the system <b>synchronizes</b> <b>links</b> and reproduces them toward efficient learning. To realize that, a software agent participates to the classroom instead of a real learner, and the agent replays the past interactions along with the video.

40|$|A {{review of}} various methods of phase and {{frequency}} synchronization of active MMIC based transmit/receive modules is presented, and particular {{emphasis is placed}} on the synchronization of oscillators through the use of an indirect subharmonic optical injection locking technique. In this approach, the nonlinear behavior of large-signal modulated laser diodes and solid-state oscillators is exploited to extend the bandwidth of the <b>synchronizing</b> <b>link</b> to the millimeter-wave frequency range. Experimental results of the phase and frequency coherency of two 21. 5 GHz FET oscillators are reported. Optimum performance is achieved at a subharmonic factor of 1 / 4, with a locking range of 84 MHz and a phase noise degradation of only 14 dB. The phase coherency measurement of two injection-locked oscillators points to a phase shift, which is introduced {{as a result of the}} frequency detuning between the slave and master oscillator signals.

40|$|A {{proposed}} {{design for}} a <b>digital</b> <b>synchronizing</b> circuit would eliminate metastability that plagues flip-flop circuits in digital input/output interfaces. This metastability is associated with sampling, by use of flip-flops, of an external signal that is asynchronous with a clock signal that drives the flip-flops: it is a temporary flip-flop failure that can occur when a rising or falling edge of an asynchronous signal occurs during the setup and/or hold time of a flip-flop. The proposed design calls for (1) use of a clock frequency greater than {{the frequency of the}} asynchronous signal, (2) use of flip-flop asynchronous preset or clear signals for the asynchronous input, (3) use of a clock asynchronous recovery delay with pulse width discriminator, and (4) tying the data inputs to constant logic levels to obtain (5) two half-rate synchronous partial signals - one for the falling and one for the rising edge. Inasmuch as the flip-flop data inputs would be permanently tied to constant logic levels, setup and hold times would not be violated. The half-rate partial signals would be recombined to construct a signal that would replicate the original asynchronous signal at its original rate but would be synchronous with the clock signal...|$|R

40|$|A fully pipelined and massively {{parallel}} {{data acquisition system}} has been developed for the COMPASS experiment at CERN. The main requirements are to read 250000 detector channels at a trigger rate of up to 100 kHz. Such high rates are only possible when using a hit selection mechanism on the front-end combined with dead-time free readout. For this purpose, a time-to-digital converter (TDC) chip has been developed and is used for all time measurement applications in COMPASS. Distributed, {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) -based readout-driver modules handle parallel front-end initialization, synchronous trigger and control-signal distribution, and local event building at a processing speed of 160 Mbyte/s. Each of the 160 readout-driver modules connects to 16 front-end boards through independent twisted pair cables (CAT 7, 600 MHz) or optical fibers using an industrial (ESCON), self <b>synchronizing</b> <b>link</b> at 40 Mbyte/s. Automatic configuration through unique module and link identification ensures the flexibility and scalability to very large detector systems. The preprocessed data are transmitted through optical fibers at 160 Mbyte/s to the master event building system.

The complete events are sent to the central data recording at the CERN main site at an average rate of 40 Mbyte/s and stored in an object oriented database.

40|$|A multi-camera {{close range}} photogrammetric system for robust and precise {{measurement}} of human body surface {{in general and}} three dimensional evaluation of bedsores in particular has been designed and constructed. MEDPHOS (MEDical PHOtogrammetric System) consists of four <b>digital</b> <b>synchronized</b> cameras the optical axes of which are convergent in a pre-specified point. A light projector is fixed {{in the center of}} the cameras-carrying rig. The projector serves as a texture provider that projects a special pattern on the surface to be measured to compensate for the lack of texture in human body surface. Determination of shape, size, and density of the pattern dots was also investigated. The proposed algorithm consists of the following steps: Both cameras and projector were calibrated so that the positional and orientational parameters of the entire system are known. A new method for image segmentation and thresholding using morphologic operators was used for the detection of the projected pattern dots from the uneven background of the images. A watrershed transformation was also applied to tackle the problem of overlapping pattern dots. Then to reduce the effects of specular reflection of light due to the humidity of the object (in the case of wounds), a novel homomorphic transformation was developed and applied to the images. After segmentation of the images, connected component labeling procedure was used to set up the actual matching points. The centroids of these components were precisely calculated. Intensity-based image matching had already been tested that- due to great deviation from the Lambertian assumption necessary for solving the correspondence problem-did not give satisfactory results. So, a new algorithm based on four focal constraint has been developed that makes it possible to carry out the matching procedure without being dependent on intensities of the pixels and without a need for approximate values of th...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{shows the}} design of microelectronic {{circuits}} composed of an oscillator, a modulator, a transmitter and an antenna. Prototype chips were recently fabricated and tested exploiting commercial 130 nm and 180 nm CMOS technologies. Detected signals have been measured using a commercial Ultra-Wide-Band amplifier connected to custom designed filters and a digital demodulator. Preliminary results are summarized along with some waveforms of the transmitted and received signals. A <b>digital</b> <b>Synchronized</b> On-Off Keying (S-OOK) was implemented to exploit the Ultra-Wide-Band transmission. In this way, each transmitted bit is coded with a S-OOK protocol. Wireless transmission capabilities of the system have been also evaluated within a one-meter distance. The chips fit a large variety of applications like spot radiation monitoring, punctual measurements of radiation in High-Energy Physics experiments or, since they have been characterized as low-power components, readout of the system for medical applications. These latter fields are those that we are investigating for in-vivo measurements on small animals.

We are also studying these circuits, to be also designed on a microelectronic device, without adding further details since these components are technically well known in the literature.
