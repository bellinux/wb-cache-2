The new design, developed by Manz Engineering Ltd.

The ability to operate the filter as required and ease of cleaning greatly expands slow sand filter applications. The MEL filter systems (MFS™) include two distinct types – the MEL Biological Filter (MEL-BF™) that is intended to replace TSSF’s and the MEL Polishing Filter (MEL-PF™) that exploits the unique ability of slow sand filtration to remove particulate material and reduce turbidity without reliance on any biological processes. The ability to operate the MEL-BF on a demand basis while retaining the treatment characteristics of TSSF is made possible by recognizing that the biological layer {{on the surface of}} the media bed (schmutzdeke and the active or biolayer) is aerobic.

The mathematical conventions they adopt (about which the classical economists were oblivious) render growth an endogenous process that proceeds on a deterministic growth path into an infinite future without a feedback into aggregate demand, or a consideration of the requirements for market clearing. This approach suggests that when contemporary theorists make casual use of well-established historical principles (in this case, division of labor, externalities, and increasing returns), the theoretical outcome may have limited substantive value despite its appearance of technical elegance. aggregate demand, classical economics, division of labor, externalities, increasing returns,...|$|E

It searches for variables that affect energy use; it explores tradeoffs between energy and other resources; it sees how these tradeoffs affect costs; it asks about effects of service standards on energy use; and, it explores energy and cost impacts {{of changes in}} ridership. ^ A model, called the Transit Service Planning Model (TSPM), is developed to explore these issues. Basically, it is a network simulation model couched in an optimization framework. Its main decision variables include: flow rates for cars and trains on network arcs during time periods of a typical weekday, and storage values for these variables, it develops an equipment manipulation plan which optimizes a user-specified objective function subject to ridership inputs, maximum headways, track and yard capacities, train length restrictions, and a fleet size constraint. ^ To support the TSPM, six submodels are developed. These predict vehicular energy consumption, vehicular power demand, fixed facility energy consumption, fixed facility power <b>demand,</b> <b>operating</b> cost, and capital cost. ^ Numerous results and conclusions are presented, based on several TSPM case studies.

40|$|The {{installed}} capacity and the grid access request for renewables is anticipated to continue {{rising in the}} EU and US in the coming years. The scarcity of reactive power and synchronous inertia are two inherent consequences of high penetration of renewables in the power system. This raises voltage security concerns, and may endanger rotor angle and frequency stability. In order to foresee these challenges, {{it is essential to}} carry out extensive planning and operation studies. Thus, new methodologies and innovative metrics are required to ensure secure and reliable operation of power systems. In this thesis, a multi-operating condition AC voltage stability constraint optimal power flow framework has been presented for transmission system planning. This framework captures multiple wind and <b>demand</b> <b>operating</b> conditions within an optimal power flow tool. The voltage stability constrained optimal power flow was applied to wind capacity allocation. It was shown that the capacity allocation pattern affects steady state voltage stability and the total allocated wind capacity. This indicates that a well-chosen allocation of wind capacity is not only in line with the trend of renewables integration in power systems but also enables limiting the occurrence probability of insecure operating points that may require costly remedies. A procedure for wind capacity allocation has been presented based on the finding on the effects of the pattern of wind capacity allocation on voltage stability. This benefits from the potential of an optimal wind capacity allocation for enhancing the voltage stability margin. Unit commitment was employed {{to take into account the}} reduction of the available reactive power sources at each operating condition for wind capacity allocation. By setting the wind capacity target and tracking the loadability margin, it was shown how the risk for a reduction in loadability margin may increase with allocation of wind generation. This procedure showed that specific locations in the system are favored for capacity allocation. It also identified weak areas in the network that experience a reduction in the loadability margin as a result of the allocation of the wind capacity. The methodology can help system operators prioritize network access and investment in the network to enhance the integration of renewables. Further, this thesis focused on the power system frequency aspect of renewables integration. Synchronous inertia acts as a means of immediate frequency support in power imbalances. Renewables often inject power into the network through power electronic converters. As such, synchronizing torque and synchronous inertia are not available in the power from renewables. Reduced levels of synchronizing torque raise concerns on rotor speed behavior under power imbalance events. The interaction of generators has been investigated by deriving the synchronizing torque coefficient matrix from the multi-machine Heffron-Philips model. It was shown that the reactive power output of the generators can be used to control the elements of the synchronizing torque coefficient matrix. It was identified that the varying levels of synchronizing torque affect the rate of change rotor speed of generators following a loss of generation event. Furthermore, the effect of rotor speed deviation due to synchronizing torque was presented from the system frequency perspective. This provides a foundation for system operators to establish strategies that benefit from the synchronizing torque coefficient matrix characteristics for controlling the frequency behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} trend on {{performing the}} prosthetic surgeries in Sweden has been indicated by researches. This {{is due to}} the fact that the quality of health care has been improved and new techniques have been developed to create comfort for the people. Notwithstanding the high quality of health care services in Sweden, there is space for efficiency improvement as budget and resources are limited and cannot respond to the <b>demand.</b> <b>Operating</b> rooms are considered to be the most expensive. However, the constraint in resources, increased waiting times and delays, late cancellation, lack of information sharing lead to inefficient use of these valuable resources as remarkable portion of operating room time is taken by non-operative activities. Implementing lean in the healthcare organizations, can help improve the quality of care by identifying the wastes and eliminating them from the procedures and create more efficient operations and reduce the time between operations. This study has focused on identification of wastes that reduce the available operative time of operating room at the prosthetic section of an operation department at a university hospital in Sweden. Accordingly, the purpose of the thesis is defined as contributing to available operative time. The study has been performed to provide the operation department of the case study with clearer picture of where, how and why the wastes happen in the department, what are their impact, and provide some suggestions based on literature, so that the wastes can be mitigated and increasing available operative time become feasible. The authors have observed the processes at the operation department for about four months and conducted several interviews with the staff of the department to gain understanding of the procedures and identify the wastes. Seven wastes of lean management have been used as a tool to discern what can be the waste activities in the operation department. After the waste identification step, the cause of each waste has been analysed by means of fishbone diagram and it has been explained that the causes trace back to people, environment, method and equipment. Although, the causes were identified during observations and interviews with personnel, using fishbone diagram and previous studies helped at categorizing and build consensus with previous studies. In the next step, impacts of identified wastes on available operative time were assessed through quantitative analysis and qualitative valuation. Efficiency measures such as non-operative time and changeover time were assessed to understand how the waste times and activities can lead to reduction of available operative time. After assessing impact of wastes on available operative time, some particular wastes have been identified as the wastes with highest effect on available operative time, which are inducing anaesthesia inside the operating room, preparing instruments for total revision surgeries inside the OR, long changeover time and long patient preparation time in the OR. Correspondingly, the main causes are also identified as insufficient number of room for anaesthesia induction outside the OR, lack of space in instrument preparation room, lack of proper communication and information sharing among staff and absence of standardisation that prolong the duration of some activities. Finally, the identified wastes and their impact on reduction of available operative time have been compared to previous studies and literature, limitation of the study has been pointed out and the conclusion has been made...|$|E
40|$|Urbanization has led {{to rapid}} and {{uncontrolled}} growth of informal housing settlements in many developing countries. As most slum growth is unplanned, these areas tend to lack basic infrastructure including sanitation. The high user rates, lack of water and electricity infrastructure, space limitations, and scant financial resources make sanitation provision a major challenge in slums. As most decentralized sanitation technologies fail when applied in these environments, better technologies {{need to be developed}} that cater to the specific needs of slum dwellers. One promising technology, the membrane bioreactor (MBR) is routinely used in developed countries when a compact and resilient treatment system is required. However, the energy requirement of existing MBRs is high, as most are aerobic systems which require aeration. Anaerobic MBRs (AnMBR), which do not require aeration, have led to an improvement of the energy profile of MBRs. As research into the technology is still in its infancy, little is known regarding its applicability in high-density urban environments. This body of research is aimed at understanding the AnMBR’s treatment performance and overall reliability in challenging circumstances similar to those encountered in slums. The appropriateness of an AnMBR was investigated with pilot and full-scale systems treating real wastewater in field conditions. The first investigation, discussed in Chapter 3, was used to determine the resilience of AnMBR treatment when subjected to periods of disuse and high fluctuations in incoming feed strengths. Decentralized systems often see much higher variations in feed composition than centralized systems as they lack large collection systems which homogenize the influent wastewater. Depending on the application, periods of low and no flow are also possible. During this long-term study it was observed that the membrane served an important role in controlling the effluent quality, especially when environmental conditions and feed characteristics varied so significantly as to upset biological stability. The system achieved an average COD removal efficiency of 88. 2 % throughout the study. It was also observed during this study that the system had higher removal efficiencies when treating higher COD concentrations. Higher strength wastewaters can routinely be found in decentralized applications where dilution water is minimal. These locations include water-efficient buildings, direct coupling to public toilets, and fecal sludge treatment plants. It was also found that the AnMBR was capable of rapidly recovering from extended periods of disuse. This ensures that the AnMBR can be applied to areas, such as schools and hotels that experience large seasonal variations and periods of disuse. The second investigation, described in Chapter 4, examined how fluctuations in ambient temperatures affect fouling resistance. In small decentralized applications, operating the reactor at ambient temperatures is the most likely scenario, as controlling the reactor temperature would incur a high energy <b>demand.</b> <b>Operating</b> at ambient temperatures means that variations can be high, and that temperatures can drop below ideal ranges. Temperature is known to affect biological treatment {{and to a lesser extent}} membrane filtration, but the interactions between the two are not fully understood. To determine the effect of temperature on operation, a pilot scale AnMBR was used to treat wastewater with fluctuating ambient temperatures. Three trials were conducted during summer and winter conditions, as well an artificially heated period. It was found that membrane permeability can be greatly affected by operating temperature but its effect varied depending on the fouling state of the membrane. Virgin, or recently cleaned membranes were not affected by low temperatures, while the permeability of slightly fouled membranes was negatively correlated to changes in temperature. When slightly fouled, a membrane TMP could increase by 2. 4 times with a 10 oC drop in temperature. The magnitude of the TMP increase could not be explained by changes in water viscosity alone. The effect of temperature on TMP decreased when fouling became severe and normal operating pressures were high. These results suggest that seasonal adjustments to AnMBR operation would be necessary to prevent sharp and excessive increases in operational TMP during cold spells. Chapter 5 investigated the feasibility of recovering water, nutrients, and energy in an off-grid and decentralized AnMBR. This investigation performed an energy, nutrient, and mass balance for a theoretical AnMBR treating water from a public toilet in a high density setting. What was concluded from this study is that complete water recycling can be accomplished in such an environment. Onsite water recycling would allow the system to be applied in arid urban areas as well as places lacking regular water provision. The study also concluded that the energy content of wastewater in a high density area would be sufficient to power an AnMBR and electronic toilet. For areas where low wastewater strengths would be expected, food waste addition to the wastewater would improve the energy profile of the system. As many urban areas of developing countries struggle with solid waste management, there is the opportunity to link food waste management with wastewater treatment. This study also highlighted the potential problems that ammonia and salinity buildup could have on a system that achieves complete water recycling. Once the system specifically designed for urban areas was deemed theoretically feasible, a full-scale, solar-powered, prototypical system was constructed in Florida and tested in India (Chapter 6). This system, which was applied in Kerala, India, was investigated for its treatment and membrane performance as well as energy consumption. During the first four months of operation, the system was able to produce high quality product water that could be used for toilet flushing. This was achieved despite the low strength of the incoming feed water and higher than anticipated wastewater production rates. The wastewater strength was low due to the system’s application in a school setting and high levels of dilution water. The reliance on multiple anti-fouling mechanisms allowed the system to operate for 4 months without a significant change in TMP. The average energy consumption per unit of produced water depended on the amount of water treated per day. On average the energy consumption was 1. 52 kWh/m 3, but that value dropped to 0. 83 kWh/m 3 when volumes greater than 200 liters were treated per day. The lowest value measured during this trial was 0. 16 kWh/m 3 when 1, 394 liters were produced. All of the energy used by the system was produced by onsite photovoltaics, with minimal carbon footprint. While the system was capable of meeting the water demand of the toilet system, further improvements in the energy demand of the system will be necessary to make the system more cost-effective, robust and reliable. These results suggest that AnMBRs can be applied in high density urban areas for the dual objectives of wastewater treatment and resource recovery. Their reliable treatment in the face of large fluctuations in feed concentration, volume, and temperature suggests they are appropriate for decentralized applications. Membrane filtration allows water to be reliably recycled onsite with minimal operator oversight. The low energy requirements of the system allow for onsite renewable energy sourced, such as photovoltaics to be used to power the system. AnMBRs are able to address many of the challenges that traditional sanitation technologies cannot, which makes them a promising technology to address the problems encountered in slum sanitation...|$|E
