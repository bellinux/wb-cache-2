500|$|A common {{concern was}} that it was simply too {{vulnerable}} in traffic. Your Computer commented that [...] "a periscope would be handy if you intended driving the C5 on busy roads since your head is only at bonnet level." [...] The Guardian's motoring correspondent wrote of her [...] "grave misgivings about its use in congested traffic... On a sharp turn it too easily lifts a rear wheel, is hazardously silent, and low down. It disappears below a car driver's sight-line when pulling up alongside. The prospect of these vehicles merging into heavy traffic, dwarfed by heavy lorries, buses, and cars, is worrying. Their low speed risks turning them into mobile chicanes for other traffic." [...] Another Guardian writer wrote that he [...] "would not want to drive [...] C5 in any traffic at all. My head was on a level with the top of a juggernaut's tyres, the exhaust fumes blasted <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> Even with the minuscule front and rear lights on, I could not feel confident that a lorry driver so high above the ground would see me." [...] Sinclair issued a publicity photograph showing the C5's industrial designer, Gus Desbarats, in a C5 alongside a cardboard cutout of an Austin Mini to illustrate that the C5 driver's seated position was actually higher than that of a Mini driver.|$|E
2500|$|Wes Craven {{said his}} {{inspiration}} for the basis of Freddy Krueger's power stemmed from several stories in the Los Angeles Times about a series of mysterious deaths: All the victims had reported recurring nightmares and died in their sleep. Additionally, Craven's original script characterized Freddy as a child molester, which Craven said was the [...] "worst thing" [...] he could think of. The {{decision was made to}} instead make him a child murderer in order to avoid being accused of exploiting the spate of highly publicized child molestation cases in California around the time A Nightmare on Elm Street went into production. Craven's inspirations for the character included a bully from his school during his youth, a disfigured homeless man who had frightened him when he was 11, and the 1970s pop song [...] "Dream Weaver" [...] by Gary Wright. In an interview, he said, [...] "When I looked down there was a man very much like Freddy walking along the sidewalk. He must have sensed that someone was looking at him and stopped and looked right <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> He scared the living daylights out of me, so I jumped back into the shadows. I waited and waited to hear him walk away. Finally I thought he must have gone, so I stepped back to the window. The guy was not only still looking at me but he thrust his head forward as if to say, 'Yes, I'm still looking at you.' The man walked towards the apartment building's entrance. I ran through the apartment to our front door as he was walking into our building on the lower floor. I heard him starting up the stairs. My brother, who is ten years older than me, got a baseball bat and went out to the corridor but he was gone." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{abruptly}} {{thrust the}} letter (as the phrase is) <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{looked up}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>face,</b> {{and the peace}} that shone from it slid <b>into</b> <b>my</b> soul and gave me strength.|$|R
60|$|When we had {{travelled}} {{through the}} vast {{extent of the}} mahogany box, I looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> guide's <b>face.</b>|$|R
60|$|And at this {{there came}} a light <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mother's <b>face</b> that never {{altogether}} left it until the end.|$|R
60|$|She laughed <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> witch-like, and {{we turned}} down the road.|$|E
60|$|He {{caught me}} viciously {{by the arm}} and looked sharply <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|She leaned forward. I {{think that}} she was trying to look <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|At this insult {{the blood}} flew <b>into</b> <b>my</b> mistress's <b>face.</b> Before {{she could say}} anything, Mr. James Smith raised his voice loud enough to drown hers.|$|R
60|$|A very grave look came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>face</b> {{and he did}} {{not answer}} me at once. When he did so his tone was low and anxious.|$|R
60|$|He {{pulled himself}} {{together}} {{and struggled to}} his feet. Then he looked round the room and finally <b>into</b> <b>my</b> anxious <b>face,</b> with an odd little laugh, strained and unnatural.|$|R
60|$|She came {{quickly to}} me and took me by the shoulders, looking <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|He looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> and smiled, and the steel-coloured {{eyes seemed}} moist and {{singularly}} soft.|$|E
60|$|The Duke {{examined}} the ring long and searchingly. Then he looked from it <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The queer {{creature}} frowned <b>into</b> <b>my</b> smiling <b>face</b> {{and flicked}} the pony with his whip. [...] "And here," [...] he muttered moodily, [...] "who knows {{but by the}} Grace of God go I?" ...|$|R
60|$|She did unbend a little. She {{put forward}} a hand--such a gracious, stooping {{attitude}} it was--and she pressed back my head. Then she looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> upturned <b>face</b> with a very wistful smile.|$|R
60|$|The air blew as freshly and revivingly upon me as it {{had ever}} blown, and the healthy colour came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> new <b>face</b> {{as it had}} come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> old one. Charley was {{wonderful}} to see, she was so radiant and so rosy; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept soundly the whole night.|$|R
60|$|It was he {{who spoke}} at last, still {{clasping}} my hands, and looking eagerly <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|His face became grave all at once. He seized me by both shoulders, {{and looked}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|What {{art thou}} {{thrusting}} that thief-catcher <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face</b> for, man? Thrusted light {{is worse than}} presented pistols.|$|E
6000|$|By {{a violent}} effort I {{controlled}} myself {{and touched her}} hand. I tried to say some word of explanation to her. She looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> working <b>face</b> and winced. [...] "I must do it," [...] she said hopelessly. Then she turned from me and began walking rapidly down the gallery.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} and the {{powerful}} hands of the Governor of Cesena were at my throat. I was lifted and tossed aside, as though I had been a hound and he the bull I had beset. And as he swung me over and crushed me to the ground, he knelt above me and grinned horribly <b>into</b> <b>my</b> purpling <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "As for myself," [...] went on Helen, [...] "I want--Oh, if I {{only knew}} {{what it is that}} I want! Well, I know I want to be outdoors, to get into the open, to feel sun and wind, to burn some color <b>into</b> <b>my</b> white <b>face.</b> I want some flesh and blood and life. I am tired out. Beyond all that I don't know very well. I'll try to keep Dot from {{attaching}} all the cowboys to her train." ...|$|R
60|$|All three {{looked at}} me. I felt the blood come <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> {{but it was}} too late to draw back.|$|E
60|$|Then Ray looked {{straight}} <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face,</b> and the colour flamed there, for I saw now {{why he had}} made me his confidant.|$|E
6000|$|Old Stuart had {{glanced up}} sharply, I am {{inclined}} to think almost fearfully, <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> [...] "You--you haven't got it?" [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|As dinner drew {{towards a}} close it {{occurred}} to me that my vis-à-vis had studiously avoided turning once towards our neighbours. If he desired to escape recognition, however, he was unsuccessful, for just as we were beginning to think of quitting our places, Lord Langerdale left his seat to speak to some acquaintances at the other end of the room, and on his way back he looked straight <b>into</b> <b>my</b> companion's <b>face.</b> He started slightly, hesitated, and then came slowly up to our table.|$|R
60|$|Through {{the waning}} day the men lay resting under the trees, talking in undertones. Some cleaned their rifles, and others lost {{themselves}} in conjectures of the attack. But Clark himself, tireless, stood {{with folded arms}} gazing at the scene below, and the sunlight on his face illumined him (to the lad standing at his side) as the servant of destiny. At length, at eventide, the sweet-toned bell of the little cathedral rang to vespers,--a gentle message of peace to war. Colonel Clark looked <b>into</b> <b>my</b> upturned <b>face.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, you brute!" [...] she cried. [...] "Are all {{men like}} this? Help {{me to get}} her <b>into</b> <b>my</b> room--and her <b>face</b> is cut against the table. Oh, will you be quiet, and help me to carry her? I hate you, and I hate Captain Kurrell. Lift her up {{carefully}} and now--go! Go away!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Faith, cousin, {{you have}} been of late for ever flinging my riches <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b> I have enough for my wants and for my creditors." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{expected}} to see her run right off; but she didn't, but stood as quiet as may be, with her eyes looking up <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Smith, {{can you not}} {{guess so}} simple a thing?" [...] said Edra, placing her white hands on my {{shoulders}} and smiling straight <b>into</b> <b>my</b> <b>face.</b>|$|E
60|$|This {{determination}} greatly disturbed Walkirk. He did {{not wish}} to see me perform a service for myself which it was his business to perform for me, and in which he had failed. I know that he gave the matter the most earnest consideration, and two days after my late secretary and her husband had left me he came <b>into</b> <b>my</b> study, his <b>face</b> shining with a new idea.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not {{difficult}} for me, I think, Clennam,' returned his partner. 'I see him bringing present anxiety, and, I fear, future sorrow, <b>into</b> <b>my</b> old friend's house. I see him wearing deeper lines <b>into</b> <b>my</b> old friend's <b>face,</b> the nearer he draws to, and the oftener he looks at, {{the face of}} his daughter. In short, I see him with a net about the pretty and affectionate creature whom he will never make happy.' 'We don't know,' said Clennam, almost in the tone of a man in pain, 'that he will not make her happy.' ...|$|R
40|$|Partial Abstract A mirror {{provides}} {{a reflection of}} the beholder. Not quite an exact replica, there is space and time between the original object and its reflection. Different mirrors produce different angles, lighting, tone, and mood. The mirror is a tool of reference and of introspection; of confinement and of freedom. [...] .
