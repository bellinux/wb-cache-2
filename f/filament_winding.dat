40|$|ABSTRACT: A novel {{configuration}} for FRP (fiber reinforced polymer) bridge decks, fiber <b>filaments</b> <b>winding</b> around it, is proposed. Three {{different types}} of FRP decks treated with this configuration and without it were tested and compared. The tests show that the OFR (outside filament-wound reinforcement) enhances the loading capacity of the decks by shifting their failure modes. An FRP deck product, HD, is developed based on the OFR procedure. The reinforcing mechanism of OFR is investigated by analyzing the test results and simulating the failure process with finite element software, which verifies the reinforcing effect of OFR...|$|R

40|$|International audienceSpinae are tubular surface {{appendages}} broadly {{found in}} Gram-negative bacteria. Little {{is known about}} their architecture, function or origin. Here, we report structural characterization of the spinae from marine bacteria Roseobacter sp. YSCB. Electron cryo-tomography revealed that a single <b>filament</b> <b>winds</b> into a hollow flared base with progressive change to a cylinder. Proteinase K unwound the spinae into proteolysis-resistant filaments. Thermal treatment ripped the spinae into ribbons that were melted with prolonged heating. Circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed a dominant beta-structure of the spinae. Differential scanning calorimetry analyses showed three endothermic transformations at 50 - 85 °C, 98 °C and 123 °C, respectively. The heating almost completely disintegrated the spinae, abolished the 98 °C transition and destroyed the beta-structure. Infrared spectroscopy identified the amide I spectrum maximum at a position {{similar to that of}} amyloid fibrils. Therefore, the spinae distinguish from other bacterial appendages, e. g. flagella and stalks, in both the structure and mechanism of assembly...|$|R

The present paper {{evaluates the}} tip vortex {{evolution}} of a {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} model using the stereo particle image velocimetry technology. The measurements of the wake region up to 2. 7 diameters downstream are first conducted using the phase-locked technique based on two high speed CCD cameras. Parameters that describe the helical vortex wake, such as the velocity, helicoidal pitch and vortex vorticity, are presented at two tip speed ratios. The vortex interaction and stability of helical vortex <b>filaments</b> within <b>wind</b> turbine wake are seen throughout the measurement domain. The results show the wake structure varies with tip speed ratio, and the helicoidal pitch of tip vortex trajectory reduces while the diffusion of tip vortex is faster with increasing tip speed ratio...|$|R

40|$|The tangled nodal lines (wave vortices) in random, {{three-dimensional}} wavefields are {{studied as}} an exemplar of a fractal loop soup. Their statistics are a three-dimensional counterpart to the characteristic random behaviour of nodal domains in quantum chaos, but in three-dimensions the <b>filaments</b> can <b>wind</b> around {{one another to}} give distinctly different large scale behaviours. By tracing numerically {{the structure of the}} vortices, their conformations are shown to follow recent analytical predictions for random vortex tangles with periodic boundaries, where the local disorder of the model `averages out' to produce large scale power law scaling relations whose universality classes do not depend on the local physics. These results explain previous numerical measurements in terms of an explicit effect of the periodic boundaries, where the statistics of the vortices are strongly affected by the large scale connectedness of the system even at arbitrarily high energies. The statistics are investigated primarily for static (monochromatic) wavefields, but the analytical results are further shown to directly describe the reconnection statistics of vortices evolving in certain dynamic systems, or occurring during random perturbations of the static configuration.

Diploma de Estudios Avanzados [EN] Cape Ghir (~ 31 °N), in the Canary Current System, {{is an area}} of {{permanent}} coastal upwelling with maximum intensity in summer-autumn, when a stronger across-shore thermal gradient and increased mesoscale activity are also present. The effects of spatial (a coastal-ocean transect with 7 stations) and temporal (5 dates: from December 2008 to October 2009) variations in upwelling conditions on the structure of planktonic communities was investigated. Multivariate analyses on the environmental conditions identified two main upwelling phases, weak and moderate; additionally, the most coastal station was, in all cases, distinct from the rest. Cluster formation was mostly influenced by nutrient concentration (space), and by sea surface temperature and number of days favourable to upwelling (time). These clusters were also representative of the spatial and temporal variability in the planktonic assemblages, implying that changes in the upwelling conditions do influence community structure. In terms of biomass, the dominant functional groups were mixed assemblages of dinoflagellates and ciliates (> 51 %); diatoms contributions were moderate to low (53 %), which was mostly represented by dinoflagellates and ciliates. As autotrophic biomass, total chlorophyll-a was dominated by the nanoplankton fraction (flagellate and dinoflagellate); however, diatoms and dinoflagellates (microplanktonic) made the highest contributions to carbon biomass. This paradox probably results from suboptimal physiological conditions for diatoms and/or from a significant contribution by mixotrophs (microplanktonic dinoflagellate and ciliate taxa). Mean heterotrophic:autotrophic biomass ratios (pico-to microplankton) were mostly 1 (inverted pyramid) without it. The factors that might contribute to the structure of the phytoplankton assemblages in this system most likely include nutrient limitation in the upwelled waters, a narrow continental shelf, mesoscale activity dominated by the formation of a strong across-shore front and of a weak <b>filament,</b> and <b>wind</b> intensities which are mostly weak to moderate for most of the year. </p...|$|R

The aerodynamics of a wind turbine are governed by the flow around the rotor, where the prediction of air loads on rotor blades in different operational conditions and its relation to rotor structural dynamics is crucial for design purposes. One of the most important challenges in wind turbine aerodynamics is therefore to accurately predict the forces on the blade, where the blade and wake are modeled by different approaches such as the Blade Element Momentum (BEM) theory, the vortex method and Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). Here, the application of the vortex <b>filament</b> method for <b>wind</b> turbine aerodynamic performance is used. Different blade models such as the lifting line and the lifting surface with prescribed and free wake models are studied.

40|$|Our {{three-dimensional}} hydro-dynamical {{simulations of}} starbursts examine {{the formation of}} superbubbles over a range of driving luminosities and mass loadings that determine superbubble growth and wind velocity. From this we determine {{the relationship between the}} velocity of a galactic wind {{and the power of the}} starburst. We find a threshold for the formation of a wind, above which the speed of the wind is not affected by grid resolution or the temperature floor of our radiative cooling. We investigate the effect two different temperature floors in our radiative cooling prescription have on wind kinematics and content. We find that cooling to 10 K instead of to 10 ^ 4 K increases the mass fraction of cold neutral and hot X-ray gas in the galactic wind while halving that in warm Hα. Our simulations show the mass of cold gas transported into the lower halo does not depend on the starburst strength. Optically bright filaments form at the edge of merging superbubbles, or where a cold dense cloud has been disrupted by the <b>wind.</b> <b>Filaments</b> formed by merging superbubbles will persist and grow to > 400 pc in length if anchored to a star forming complex.

Warm and cold matter in the galactic wind show asymmetric absorption profiles consistent with observations, with a thin tail up to the wind velocity. Comment: 14 pages, 14 figures.
