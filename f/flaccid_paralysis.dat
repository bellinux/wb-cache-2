5|$|Paralytic {{poliomyelitis}} may be clinically suspected {{in individuals}} experiencing acute onset of <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> {{in one or}} more limbs with decreased or absent tendon reflexes in the affected limbs that cannot be attributed to another apparent cause, and without sensory or cognitive loss.|$|E
5|$|Bites {{in which}} {{envenomation}} does occur are usually painless {{and may not}} even be noticed when contact is made. Teeth may remain in the wound. Usually, little or no swelling occurs, and rarely are any nearby lymph nodes affected. The most important symptoms are rhabdomyolysis (rapid breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue) and paralysis. Early symptoms include headache, a thick-feeling tongue, thirst, sweating, and vomiting. Symptoms that can occur 30minutes to several hours after the bite include generalized aching, stiffness, and tenderness of muscles all over the body. Passive stretching of the muscles is also painful, and trismus, which is similar to tetanus, is common. This is followed later on by symptoms typical of other elapid envenomations: a progressive <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis,</b> starting with ptosis and paralysis of voluntary muscles. Paralysis of muscles involved in swallowing and respiration can be fatal.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of notable {{people who}} have survived the {{infectious}} disease poliomyelitis. Poliomyelitis (often simply called polio) is an acute viral infection that involves the gastrointestinal tract and occasionally the central nervous system. Poliovirus is acquired by faecal-oral or oral transmission. Prior to the introduction of a vaccine in 1955, infection was common, with epidemics during the summer and autumn of temperate countries. An eradication programme has reduced the number of reported polio cases worldwide by more than 99% since the mid-1980s. Most infections are asymptomatic; a small number cause a minor illness that is indistinguishable from many other viral illnesses; less than 1% result in acute <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> The extent of paralysis varies from part of a limb to quadriplegia and respiratory failure. The latter was often treated with an iron lung until, it was hoped, the patient recovered. Around 30–40 years after contracting paralytic poliomyelitis, about 25–40% of cases lead to post-polio syndrome. Symptoms include muscle pain, further weakening of muscles and paralysis.|$|E
30|$|Guillain Barre Syndrome (GBS) is an {{autoimmune}} inflammatory polyneuropathy {{characterized by}} <b>flaccid</b> areflexic <b>paralysis,</b> albuminocytologic dissociation in the CSF and demyelination. Clinical weakness {{is marked by}} axonal injury not by the demyelination; therefore axonal form has a worse prognosis.|$|R
50|$|Botulinum toxin is a neurotoxin {{present in}} the {{cytoplasm}} of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium botulinum. It binds presynaptically with high affinity to sites on cholinergic nerve terminals, decreasing release of acetylcholine, thereby blocking neuromuscular transmission, and causing <b>flaccid</b> muscle <b>paralysis.</b> Crotoxin appears to act similarly.|$|R
50|$|Botulinum toxin is {{the most}} acutely lethal toxin that is known. It is {{produced}} by the bacterium clostridium botulinum. It acts inside nerve terminals by decreasing the release of acetylcholine, blocking neuromuscular transmission and thereby causing <b>flaccid</b> muscular <b>paralysis.</b> As a result, the muscle is weakened for about 3 to 4 months.|$|R
25|$|Active {{surveillance}} {{for wild}} poliovirus through reporting and laboratory testing {{of all cases}} of acute <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> Acute <b>Flaccid</b> <b>Paralysis</b> (AFP) is a clinical manifestation of poliomyelitis characterized by weakness or paralysis and reduced muscle tone without other obvious cause (e.g., trauma). AFP is also associated {{with a number of}} other pathogenic agents including enteroviruses, echoviruses, and adenoviruses, among others. among children less than fifteen years of age.|$|E
25|$|In {{poultry and}} wild birds, <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> is usually {{seen in the}} legs, wings, neck and eyelids. Broiler {{chickens}} with the toxicoinfectious form may also have diarrhea with excess urates.|$|E
25|$|A {{minority}} {{of individuals with}} hand, {{foot and mouth disease}} may require hospital admission due to complications such as inflammation of the brain, inflammation of the meninges, or acute <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> Non-neurologic complications such as inflammation of the heart, fluid in the lungs, or bleeding into the lungs may also occur.|$|E

40|$|A 57 -year-old woman {{suffering}} from multiple sclerosis took an estimated 1500 mg of baclofen. She became deeply unconscious with generalized <b>flaccid</b> muscle <b>paralysis</b> and absent tendon reflexes. Toxicological analysis confirmed {{the presence of}} baclofen together with small amounts of paracetamol and glutethimide.

50|$|The {{syndrome}} typically presents as {{a progressive}} <b>flaccid</b> symmetric <b>paralysis</b> with areflexia, often causing respiratory failure. Electromyographic studies and nerve conduction studies show normal motor conduction velocity and latency with decreased amplitude of compound muscle action potentials. F wave and sensory nerve action potentials are often normal in this illness. Pathologically, it is a noninflammatory axonopathy without demyelination. Antibodies attack the coating {{of the motor}} neurons without causing inflammation or loss of myelin. It does not affect sensory neurons, so sensation remains intact despite loss of movement.|$|R
25|$|Botulinum toxin (BTX) is a {{neurotoxic}} protein {{produced by}} the bacterium Clostridium botulinum and related species. It prevents {{the release of the}} neurotransmitter acetylcholine from axon endings at the neuromuscular junction and thus causes <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> Infection with the bacterium causes the disease botulism. The toxin is also used commercially in medicine, cosmetics and research.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} {{serological}} varieties of the bacterium denoted by the letters A to H. The toxin {{from all of}} these acts {{in the same way}} and produces similar symptoms: the motor nerve endings are prevented from releasing acetylcholine, causing <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> and symptoms of blurred vision, ptosis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, cramps, and respiratory difficulty.|$|E
25|$|The {{growth of}} the spores {{releases}} botulinum toxin, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream and taken throughout the body, causing paralysis by blocking the release of acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction. Typical symptoms of infant botulism include constipation, lethargy, weakness, difficulty feeding and an altered cry, often progressing to a complete descending <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis.</b> Although constipation is usually the first symptom of infant botulism, it is commonly overlooked.|$|E

50|$|Floppy trunk {{syndrome}} (abbreviated FTS, {{also known}} as <b>flaccid</b> trunk <b>paralysis)</b> is a condition that causes trunk paralysis in African bush elephants. Initially observed in 1989, the syndrome primarily affected bull elephants in several select regions in Zimbabwe. Afflicted elephants exhibit paralysis in their trunk, often having to adapt to feed. The loss of their trunks' prehensile abilities results in malnutrition and possibly death. The condition {{is a result of}} degeneration of nerves in the trunk, and is suggested to be a result of either heavy metals or toxins. There is debate over whether the condition is reversible.|$|R
25|$|Roosevelt's {{physicians}} {{never mentioned}} Guillain–Barré syndrome (GBS) in their communications concerning Roosevelt's case, {{indicating that they}} were not aware of it as a diagnostic possibility. All reports before 1921 of what is now called GBS were by European physicians, in European journals. The result was that very few American physicians knew that GBS was a separate disease. For example, Lovett mistakenly believed that Landry’s ascending paralysis, now termed GBS, was one of the clinical presentations of paralytic polio. In 1921, an American physician would assume that if an individual developed a sudden, non-traumatic <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis,</b> it was due to paralytic polio. The concept of GBS as a separate disease was not widely accepted in the United States until after the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Sheep may be {{infected}} by four recognized species of Sarcocystis: S. arieticanis and S. tenella (S. ovicanis) are pathogenic; S. gigantea (S. ovifelis) and S. medusiformis are non-pathogenic. Infection with these parasites {{is common in}} the US with over 80% of sheep examined showing evidence of infection. S. arieticanis and S. tenella both produce extra intestinal disease. Anemia, anorexia, ataxia, and abortions are the chief clinical signs. Myositis with <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> has been reported {{as a consequence of}} infection. Ovine protozoan myeloencephalitis is a recognised syndrome that may occur in outbreaks. The usual pathological findings in such cases are multifocal spinal cord white matter oedema and necrosis, glial nodules and mild to moderate nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis. The diagnosis may be established finding protozoan bodies (12.7-23.0 micrometres) that stain immunocytochemically for Sarcocystis epitopes.|$|E
25|$|The {{symptoms}} of exposure include: nervousness/restlessness, miosis (contraction of the pupil), rhinorrhea (runny nose), excessive salivation, dyspnea (difficulty in breathing due to bronchoconstriction/secretions), sweating, bradycardia (slow heartbeat), loss of consciousness, convulsions, <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis,</b> loss of bladder and bowel control, apnea (breathing stopped) and lung blisters. The exact {{symptoms of}} overexposure {{are similar to}} those created by all nerve agents. Tabun is toxic even in minute doses. The number and severity of symptoms which appear vary according to the amount of the agent absorbed and rate of entry of it into the body. Very small skin dosages sometimes cause local sweating and tremors accompanied with characteristically constricted pupils with few other effects. Tabun is about half as toxic as sarin by inhalation, but in very low concentrations it is more irritating to the eyes than sarin. Also, tabun breaks down slowly, which after repeated exposure can lead to build up in the body.|$|E
40|$|Background Botulinum {{neurotoxins}} (BoNTs) {{are considered}} to be the most toxic substances known on earth and are responsible for human botulism, a life-threatening disease characterized by <b>flaccid</b> muscle <b>paralysis</b> that occurs naturally by food-poisoning or colonization of the gas-trointestinal tract by BoNT-producing clostridia. BoNTs have been classified as category A agent by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and are listed among the six agents with the highest risk to be used as bioweapons. Neutralizing antibodies are required for the development of effective anti-botulism therapies to deal with the potential risk of exposure.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of severe {{hypokalemia}} and <b>flaccid</b> muscle <b>paralysis</b> following a suicide attempt associating the calcium channel blocker amlodipine, the antidepressant fluoxetine and barium carbonate. Despite rapid correction of severe, life-threatening hypokalemia, areflexic quadriplegia persisted, suggesting a direct effect of barium on muscle cells. Continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) was initiated. We determined barium concentration in the urine, plasma, and hemodiafiltrate during CVVHDF. We subsequently calculated the amounts of barium eliminated both by the CVVHDF and the kidneys. CVVHDF triples the measured barium elimination, reduced serum barium half-life {{by a factor of}} three, stabilized serum potassium levels, and rapidly improved motor strength, with complete neurological recovery within 24 h.

40|$|Background: Brachial palsy {{is a rare}} {{condition}} {{beyond the}} neonatal period. Usually it is caused by physical mechanisms, but may be related with osteo-articular infections. There are few cases describing the association between these infections and true nerve paralysis. On the other hand, pseudo-paralysis or apparent weakness of a limb associated with septic arthritis or osteomyelitis is a well-documented phenomenon Case Report: We describe three cases of osteoarticular infection manifested by <b>flaccid</b> limb <b>paralysis</b> without the typical systemic signs of infection. The timing of rcognition differed among the cases, {{as well as the}} therapeutic interventions and the outcome. Discussion: Osteo-articular infections may go unrecognized in infancy.

25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was ivermectin at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. Ivermectin was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis</b> leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E
500|$|The venom of this elapid, Laticauda colubrina, {{is a very}} {{powerful}} neurotoxic protein, with a subcutaneous LD50 in mice of [...] 0.45mg/kg body weight. The venom is an α-neurotoxin that disrupts synapses by competing with acetylcholine for receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, similar to erabutoxins and α-bungarotoxins. In mice, lethal venom doses caused lethargy, <b>flaccid</b> <b>paralysis,</b> and convulsions in quick succession before death. Dogs injected with lethal doses produced symptoms consistent with fatal hypertension and cyanosis observed in human sea snake bite victims.|$|E

40|$|Dynorphin A reduced lumbosacral blood flow, {{elevated}} cerebro-spinal fluid {{lactic acid}} concentrations and caused <b>flaccid</b> hindlimb <b>paralysis</b> and striking neuropathological changes after its injec-tion into the spinal subarachnoid space in rats.

Thus, it appears that this peptide lacks direct neurotoxic effects and that neuronal injuries in vivo result primarily from ischemia associated with dynorphin A-induced blood flow reductions.

40|$|Certain {{bacterial}} species {{belonging to}} the genus Clostridium are characterized by their ability to produce extremely potent neurotoxins. Classified as either tetanus neurotoxin (TeNT) or botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT), they act by inhibiting neurotransmitter release at CNS synapses (TeNT) and neuromuscular junctions (BoNT), leading to the spastic (tetanus) or <b>flaccid</b> (botulism) <b>paralysis.</b> To date, eight different neurotoxin types have been recognized; these are single form of TeNT, and seven (A-G) serologically distinct BoNTs. One {{of the most important}} factors to emphasize is that while production of TeNT is confined to a single clostridial species, Clostridium tetani, BoNT is produced by a range of species. The deadly nature of the diseases these toxins cause has assured them some considerable attention from the scientific community. As a result, much is now known of their mode of action...|$|R

500|$|The virus {{enters the}} central nervous system in about 1 percent of infections. Most {{patients}} with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic aseptic meningitis, with symptoms of headache, neck, back, abdominal and extremity pain, fever, vomiting, lethargy, and irritability.
