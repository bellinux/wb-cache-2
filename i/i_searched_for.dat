He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk's popular The Phantom, a syndicated newspaper comic strip character with which Kane was also familiar, and that he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity. As Finger described, [...] "Bruce Wayne's first name came from Robert Bruce, the Scottish patriot. Wayne, being a playboy, {{was a man of}} gentry. <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> a name that would suggest colonialism. I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne." [...] Kane decades later in his autobiography described Finger as [...] "a contributing force on Batman right from the beginning... I made Batman a superhero-vigilante when I first created him. Bill turned him into a scientific detective." [...] Finger biographer Marc Tyler Nobleman described, [...] "Bob [...] showed Bat-Man to [...] Vin [...] — without Bill. Vin promptly wanted to run Bat-Man, and Bob negotiated a deal — without including Bill." ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was still}} dark. I {{was in the}} middle of a wide valley, {{surrounded}} by low hills, and carpeted with high grass drenched in dew. <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> water in the nearest gully, and soon found a clear pool. I was very thirsty, but long after I had quenched my thirst I continued to drink, that I might have sufficient for the whole day.|$|E
60|$|Accordingly <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> a {{hiding place}} and finally found one by accident, inside a huge hanging {{ornament}} which swung {{from the ceiling}} of the hall, and about ten feet from the floor. Into the capacious bowl-like vase I sprang with ease, and scarcely had I settled down within it than I heard a number of people enter the apartment. The group stopped beneath my hiding place and I could plainly overhear their every word.|$|E

60|$|At last it {{occurred}} to me that something was lacking in the Havana cigar. It did not quite fulfil my youthful anticipations. I experimented. I bought what was called a seed-leaf cigar with a Connecticut wrapper. After a while I became satiated of these, and <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> something else, The Pittsburg stogy was recommended to me.

6000|$|The sun {{had long}} set, and with flint and tow they were {{touching}} the flame to the candles, which flickered transparent yellow in the deepening twilight.

The body was neither in the bay below nor hung up anywhere on the cliff. One of two things, then, must have happened. Either Palliser's body must have been taken out by the tide, which flows down the Bristol Channel in a curious way, and will never now be recovered, or he made a remarkable escape and decided, under all the circumstances, to make a fresh start in life." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{followed}} them rapidly till they began feeding {{in a little}} valley, then with much caution, stealing from tree to thicket, giving scant attention to the trail, but searching the woods ahead; for the last [...] "sign" [...] showed that I was now but a few minutes behind the deer. There they were at last, two graceful forms gliding like gray shadows among the snow-laden branches. But in vain <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> a lordly head with wide rough antlers sweeping proudly over the brow; my buck was not there.

6000|$|... 1166. <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> an unexceptionable test of my view, {{not merely}} in the {{accordance}} of known facts with it, {{but in the}} consequences which would flow from it if true; especially in those which would not {{be consistent with the}} theory of action at a distance. Such a consequence seemed to me to present itself in the direction in which inductive action could be exerted. If in straight lines only, though not perhaps decisive, it would be against my view; but if in curved lines also, that would be a natural result of the action of contiguous particles, but, as I think, utterly incompatible with action at a distance, as assumed by the received theories, which, according to every fact and analogy we are acquainted with, is always in straight lines.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> the cassave root, {{which the}} Indians {{in all that}} climate make their bread of, but I could find none. I saw large plants of aloes, but did not then {{understand}} them: I saw several sugar-canes, but wild, and, for want of cultivation, imperfect. I contented myself with these discoveries for this time, and came back, musing with myself what course I might take to know the virtue and goodness {{of any of the}} fruits or plants which I should discover, but could bring it to no conclusion; for, in short, I had made so little observation while I was in the Brasils, that I knew little of the plants of the field, at least very little that might serve me to any purpose now in my distress.|$|E
6000|$|I remembered {{now that}} for many months I had heard nothing of her ambitious project, so I {{questioned}} David and discovered that it was abandoned. He could not say why, nor was it necessary that he should, the trivial little reason was at once so plain to me. From that moment all my sympathy with Mary was spilled, and <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> some means of exulting over her until I found it. It was this. I decided, unknown even to David, {{to write the book}} [...] "The Little White Bird," [...] of which she had proved herself incapable, and then when, in the fulness of time, she held her baby on high, implying that she had done a big thing, I was to hold up the book. I venture to think that such a devilish revenge was never before planned and carried out.|$|E

My thesis, Memory Palace, deals with this tenuous, liminal state between my childhood spent in rural Chad, Africa, and the adulthood in which I now find myself in urban America and elsewhere. <b>I</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> a place of belonging [...] knowing that the road back to the days I spent sipping tea just miles from Saharan dunes has long since disappeared. This project reflects not only metaphysical journeys but also formal and stylistic departures as <b>I</b> <b>search</b> <b>for</b> a means of expression that is as much a personal journey as it is linguistic. Memory Palace is ultimately an exploration of experiences abroad and beyond [...] an effort to find a path for myself that connects past with present, grief with consolation...|$|R

60|$|Any man can be praised--and rightly praised. If he only {{stands on}} two legs he does {{something}} a cow cannot do. If a rich man can manage to stand {{on two legs}} for a reasonable time, it is called self-control. If he has only one leg, it is called (with some truth) self-sacrifice. I could say something nice (and true) about every man I have ever met. Therefore, I do not doubt I could find something nice about Lyons or Selfridge if <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> it. But I shall not. The nearest postman or cab-man will provide me with just the same brain of steel and heart of gold as these unlucky lucky men.

6000|$|As {{the routine}} {{business}} began <b>I</b> <b>searched</b> <b>for</b> Krebs, {{to find him}} presently at a desk beside a window {{in the rear of}} the hall making notes on a paper; there was, confessedly, little satisfaction in the thought that the man whose gaunt features I contemplated was merely one of those impractical idealists who beat themselves to pieces against the forces that sway the world and must forever sway it. I should be compelled to admit that he represented something unique in that assembly if he had the courage to get up and oppose House Bill 709. I watched him narrowly; the suggestion intruded itself--perhaps he had been [...] "seen," [...] as the Colonel expressed it. I repudiated it. I grew impatient, feverish; the monotonous reading of the clerk was interrupted now and then by the sharp tones of the Speaker assigning his various measures to this or that committee, [...] "unless objection is offered," [...] while the members moved about and murmured among themselves; Krebs had stopped making notes; he was looking out of the window. At last, without any change of emphasis in his droning voice, the clerk announced the recommendation of the Committee on Judiciary that House Bill 709 ought to pass.|$|E
