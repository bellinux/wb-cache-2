The results of this work show that whereas {{the estimates of}} the shear strength obtained by these two methods for titanium diboride are consistent with one another, those of aluminium nitride are not. This is at least {{partly due to the}} observed inconsistency between the simultaneous measurements of longitudinal and lateral stresses in aluminium nitride...|$|R
40|$|In marked {{contrast}} to conventional string theory, ambitwistor strings remain solvable worldsheet theories when coupled to curved background fields. We use this fact to consider the quantization of ambitwistor strings on plane wave metric and <b>plane</b> wave <b>gauge</b> field backgrounds. In each case, the worldsheet model is anomaly free {{as a consequence of}} the background satisfying the field equations. We derive vertex operators (in both fixed and descended picture numbers) for gravitons and gluons on these backgrounds from the worldsheet CFT, and study the 3 -point functions of these vertex operators on the Riemann sphere. These worldsheet correlation functions reproduce the known results for 3 -point scattering amplitudes of gravitons and gluons in gravitational and <b>gauge</b> theoretic <b>plane</b> wave backgrounds, respectively.

40|$|This {{is a book}} chapter. Fundamental to the {{understanding}} of furniture is an interest in the continuities and changes in the use of tools, and the application of techniques to furniture making. The development of tools over a long period established ‘type-forms’ that often remain the basis of hand tools (and in many cases powered versions) that are used today. Although most tools could be purchased from tool suppliers, there has been, and still is, a tradition of furniture-makers devising and making their own versions of tools for their own use. These included for example, bevels, braces, clamps, scratch stocks, moulding boxes, saw frames, <b>gauges,</b> lathes, <b>planes</b> and squares. This article briefly traces the development of the various processes and associated tools, from cutting out and shaping, construction and assembly and decoration in the period 1600 - 1840...|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} Szekeres co-ordinates are {{naturally}} adapted to study Penrose limits in classical string backgrounds. Relating the "old" colliding wave {{problem to the}} Penrose limiting procedure as employed in string theory we discuss how two orthogonal Penrose limits uniquely determine the underlying target space when certain symmetry is imposed. We construct a conformally deformed background with two distinct, yet exactly solvable {{in terms of the}} string theory on R-R backgrounds, Penrose limits. Exploiting further the similarities between the two problems we find that the Penrose limit of the gauged WZW Nappi-Witten universe is itself a <b>gauged</b> WZW <b>plane</b> wave solution of Svetsos and Tseytlin. Finally, we discuss some issues related to singularity, show the existence of a large class of non-Hausdorff solutions with Killing Cauchy Horizons and indicate a possible resolution of the problem of the definition of quantum vacuum in string theory on these time-dependent backgrounds...|$|R

40|$|Perturbatively around flat space, the {{scattering}} amplitudes of gravity {{are related to}} those of Yang-Mills by colour-kinematic duality, under which gravitational amplitudes are obtained as the 'double copy' of the corresponding gauge theory amplitudes. We consider {{the question of how}} to extend this relationship to curved scattering backgrounds, focusing on certain 'sandwich' plane waves. We calculate the 3 -point amplitudes on these backgrounds and find that a notion of double copy remains in the presence of background curvature: graviton amplitudes on a gravitational plane wave are the double copy of gluon amplitudes on a <b>gauge</b> field <b>plane</b> wave. This is non-trivial in that it requires a non-local replacement rule for the background fields and the momenta and polarization vectors of the fields scattering on the backgrounds. It must also account for new 'tail' terms arising from scattering off the background. These encode a memory effect in {{the scattering}} amplitudes, which naturally double copies as well.

The interband tunneling is induced by the potential field and for vanishing gauge field is described by the common Landau-Zener theory. We generalize this theory for non-zero gauge field. The depletion rates of low-energy bands are calculated by using semi-analytical method of the truncated Floquet matrix. Comment: 14 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

50|$|Having {{survived the}} Depression, Minneapolis-Honeywell was {{approached}} by the US military for engineering and manufacturing projects. In 1941, Minneapolis-Honeywell developed a superior tank periscope and camera stabilizers, {{as well as the}} C-1 autopilot. The C-1 revolutionized precision bombing in the war effort, and was used on the two B-29 bombers that dropped atomic bombs on Japan in 1945. The success of these projects led Minneapolis-Honeywell to open an Aero division in Chicago on October 5, 1942. This division was responsible {{for the development of the}} formation stick to control autopilots, more accurate gas <b>gauges</b> for <b>planes,</b> and the turbo supercharger. In 1950, Minneapolis-Honeywell’s Aero division was contracted for the controls on the first US nuclear submarine, USS Nautilus. The following year, the company acquired Intervox Company for their sonar, ultrasonics, and telemetry technologies. Honeywell also helped develop and manufacture the RUR-5 ASROC for the US Navy.In 1953, in cooperation with the USAF Wright-Air Development Center, Honeywell developed an automated control unit that could control an aircraft through various stages of a flight, from taxiing, to takeoff, to the point where the aircraft neared its destination and the pilot took over for landing. Called the Automatic Master Sequence Selector, the onboard control operated similarly to a player piano to relay instructions to the aircraft's autopilot at certain way points during the flight, significantly reducing the pilot's workload. Technologically, this effort had parallels to contemporary efforts in missile guidance and numerical control. Honeywell also developed the Wagtail missile with the USAF.|$|R
40|$|An NMR crystallographic {{approach}} incorporating multinuclear {{solid state}} NMR (SSNMR), X-ray structure determinations and density functional theory (DFT) {{are used to}} characterise the H bonding arrangements in benzoic acid (BZA) and the corresponding Group I alkali metal hydrogen dibenzoates (HD) systems. Since the XRD data often cannot precisely confirm the proton position within the hydrogen bond, {{the relationship between the}} experimental SSNMR parameters and the ability of <b>gauge</b> included <b>plane</b> augmented wave (GIPAW) DFT to predict them becomes a powerful constraint that can assist with further structure refinement. Both the 1 H and 13 C MAS NMR methods provide primary descriptions of the H bonding via accurate measurements of the 1 H and 13 C isotropic chemical shifts, and the individual 13 C chemical shift tensor elements; these are unequivocally corroborated by DFT calculations, which together accurately describe the trend of the H bonding strength as the size of the monovalent cation changes. In addition, 17 O MAS and DOR NMR form a powerful combination to characterise the O environments, with the DOR technique providing highly resolved 17 O NMR data which helps verify unequivocally the number of inequivalent O positions for the conventional 17 O MAS NMR to process. Further multinuclear MAS and static NMR studies involving the quadrupolar 7 Li, 39 K, 87 Rb and 133 Cs nuclei, and the associated DFT calculations, provide trends and a corroboration of the H bond geometry which assist in the understanding of these arrangements. Even though the crystallographic H positions in each H bonding arrangement reported from the single crystal X-ray studies are prone to uncertainty, the good corroboration between the measured and DFT calculated chemical shift and quadrupole tensor parameters for the Group I alkali species suggest that these reported H positions are reliable...|$|R
5000|$|Geometrically {{the world}} sheet of string is sliced {{by a system}} of {{parallel}} planes to fix a specific parametrization, or <b>gauge</b> on it.The <b>planes</b> are defined by a normal vector nμ, the gauge axis.If this vector belongs to light cone, the parametrization correspondsto light cone gauge, if it is directed along world sheet's period Pμ,it is time-like Rohrlich's gauge.The problem of the standard light cone gauge is that the vector nμ is constant, e.g. nμ = (1, 1, 0, 0), and the system of planes is [...] "frozen" [...] in Minkowskispace-time. Lorentz transformations change {{the position of the}} world sheet with respect to these fixed planes, and they are followed by reparametrizations of the world sheet. On the quantum level the reparametrization group has anomaly, which appears also in Lorentz group and violates Lorentz invariance of the theory. On the other hand, the Rohrlich's gauge relates nμ with the world sheet itself. As a result, the Lorentz generators transform nμ and the world sheet simultaneously, without reparametrizations. The same property holds if one relates light-like axis nμ with the world sheet, using in addition to Pμ other dynamical vectors available in string theory. In this way one constructs Lorentz-invariant parametrization of the world sheet, where the Lorentz group acts trivially and does nothave quantum anomalies.|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{experimental}} results are given for unreinforced circular; elliptical and square cut-outs with rounded corners, under {{a variety of}} loading conditions. These results are then compared with the infinite flat plate solution, using the complex stress function and the method of conformal transformation. It is generally considered sufficiently accurate for a plane stress solution to be applied to problems of cut-outs in cylindrical shells, provided that the cut-out dimensions are small compared with the radius of curvature of the shell. In order to investigate this effect of shell curvature, a number of experiments were carried out on cutouts in two pressurised cylinders, and to obtain a wider range of loading conditions, a further series of experiments was conducted using a plane loading frame. Two aluminium alloy cylinders, of 44 in. and 60 in. diameter, were pressurised using air, and the stress conditions around the cutouts examined using electrical resistance strain <b>gauge</b> techniques. The <b>plane</b> loading frame enabled any combination of bi-axial tension and shear to be applied to a plane sheet containing the cut-out under examination. In this way the effects of body forces, which might arise in such applications as aircraft and nuclear reactors, could be simulated. The experimental results which are given generally show a close agreement with the theoretical plane stress solution...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} Contribution number 171 of the SEAFDEC Aquaculture Department. This paper {{summarizes}} experiences and {{findings in the}} development of a tidal salt pond system, integrated for commercial Artemia production. The basic rules of successful pond production of fish and shrimp, which are the exclusion of predators and competitors, the maintenance of good water-quality, the provision of sufficient food and the proper harvesting method, also govern Artemia culture. In attempting to achieve successful Artemia culture, an integrated flow-through system was developed. The necessity for a detailed plan of the ponds with well-determined elevations, advantageous positioning of gates and canals, correct pond orientations, and well-constructed dikes is considered crucial to integration. Procedures for proper Artemia pond preparation are discussed. The relatively high rainfall (1200 - 2000 mm/year) in the Philippines necessitates reliable screen designs to exclude potential fish predators and overflow devices for freshwater runoff, to extend the duration of Artemia seasons. Installation of tidal <b>plane</b> <b>gauges</b> and an auxiliary high volume pump in the salt farm permits the manipulation of water levels to ensure adequate water exchange or supply to the system, high evaporation: salt bed ratios, and optimal depths of high salinity water. The daily water requirements for the system were determined and its relationship to salt production examined. The integration of organic fertilization and the utilization of drainage from semi-intensive prawn and shrimp ponds enabled to achieve high standing crops of Artemia (up to 7 tonnes wet weight/ha) in high-salinity ponds that are unsuited for fish or prawn culture. Under optimal conditions, the Artemia cyst production reaches 20 kg dry weight/ha/month...|$|R
