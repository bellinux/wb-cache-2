40|$|The {{founding}} {{depths of}} pile foundations depend {{primarily on the}} loading conditions of the superstructure {{and the strength of}} subsoil. The depth of Grade III weathered rock, the top of completely decomposed granite (CDG), and standard penetration test N-value of 200 (SPT- 200) are often used as indicators for decision-making in arriving at the preliminary founding depth of piles in Hong Kong. The work reported in this paper focuses on evaluation of the spatial variability characteristics of the above founding <b>depth</b> <b>indicators</b> at a construction site, using statistical models based on random field theory. Spatial variability characteristics are evaluated using the measured data in terms of scale of fluctuation. Geostatistics is used to obtain additional data at unsampled locations for mapping profiles of founding <b>depth</b> <b>indicators</b> over the site, using the measured data from borehole records and site investigation results. It is observed from the results that, if faults are not present, the depth of the Grade III surface exhibits the largest scale of fluctuation among the three indicators, and the variability of the ground is observed to increase with the weathering grade.

30|$|In the {{existing}} literature as discussed above, various studies have explored the relationship between financial development and economic growth. This study also tries to investigate the financial-growth nexus and also using inflation rate as another regressor to contributes {{the existing}} literature in several ways. Firstly, {{in a manner that}} differs from the existing studies of North Cyprus, we used the banks’ total deposits as the financial <b>depth</b> <b>indicator</b> to establish the relationship between finance and economic growth. Since the financial system of North Cyprus can be classified as bank-based, the accumulation of savings is an important indicator of the condition of the financial system. Secondly, we included the inflation rate in our empirical investigation, which is a new approach to assessing the relationship between finance and economic growth in North Cyprus. At the same time, this study examined the inflation-growth nexus. None of the previous studies of North Cyprus have included the inflation rate in their modelling and analysis of the finance-growth nexus. Lastly, another significant contribution of this work is that we used the quadratic match-sum method to convert the annual data to quarterly data to investigate the long-run and short-run relationships between depth, inflation, and growth. Prior studies used yearly data to investigate the long-run and short-run interactions, and used Granger causality to expound the finance and growth interaction. For this study, we used quarterly data 2 from Q 1 1978 to Q 4 2015 to investigate the relationship under the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds test combined with cointegration. However, the ARDL model suffers from problems identifying the cointegration order in a series because it is a single cointegration equation. Therefore, to improve the robustness of the results, our research also applied a combined cointegration test that produced more reliable results based on other conventional cointegration tests. After utilizing quadratic match sum method, the number of observations rose to 152. Additionally, this study applied Granger causality under VECM framework to investigate the direction of causation not only in the short and long-run but also joint causality. The limitation of this study was that there was no data available for other proxies of financial development. Hence, we used only total deposits as the financial <b>depth</b> <b>indicator</b> to establish a nexus between finance and growth.|$|R

40|$|Various {{effects of}} the {{financial}} deepening came to the centre of academics as well as policy-makers discussions during last four decades especially {{in relation to the}} financial sector development. Together with financial liberalization and international financial integration economists focus their attention to the financial deepening especially due to its potential effects on the real economy. Perspective of the fast and sustainable economic growth {{at the end of the}} 1990 s increased an attractiveness of the European transition economies (ETE) for the foreign investors that resulted in increased foreign capital inflows to ETE. International capital inflows (especially debt and portfolio capital flows) stimulate financial deepening through higher demand for financial services. As the underdeveloped financial markets obviously constrain domestic capital mobilization, the international financial integration is considered to be very useful vehicle in fostering financial sector advancement. One of the most discussed areas related to the overall {{effects of the}} financial deepening is a bi-directional relationship between financial development and economic growth. It is generally expected there is a positive effect of financial development on economic growth. On the other hand especially some country-specific institutional characteristics and different policies may significantly distort positive incentives of the financial deepening. In the paper we analyze the main aspects of the financial deepening in ten ETE in the period 2000 - 2010 using vector error correction model (VECM). In order to meet this objective we implement a multivariate cointegration methodology introduced by Johansen (1988, 1991) and Johansen and Juselius (1990) to estimate the relationships between financial <b>depth</b> <b>indicators</b> and real output in the selected group of countries. To find the order of integration of endogenous variables we test the time series for the unit root presence. In order to determine cointegrating (long-run) relationships, we follow a Johansen cointegration procedure to perform the trace test and maximum eigenvalue test. We also test the direction of the causality relationships between financial <b>depth</b> <b>indicators</b> and real output using linear Granger causality test. Using the estimated VEC model, the dynamic responses of the endogenous variables to the money stock, domestic bank deposits and domestic bank loans one standard deviation shocks are computed for each country from the group of ETE. ...|$|E

This paper evaluates the spatial variability characteristics of as-built and estimated founding depths of driven steel H piles with reference to the spatial variability characteristics of geologic profiles at a weathered soil site in Hong Kong. Spatial variability characteristics are evaluated in terms of variance and scale of fluctuation. The variability of three founding <b>depth</b> <b>indicators,</b> i. e., the depth of Grade-III bedrock, the depth of standard penetration test blow count "N" of 200 blows/ 0. 3 m (SPT- 200), and the depth of completely decomposed granite over the site was estimated.

The as-built founding depths are mostly between the SPT- 200 profile and the Grade-III bedrock profile. The variances of as-built pile length are similar to those with depth of SPT- 200 but less than those with depth of Grade-III bedrock. The scale of fluctuation of as-built pile length is on the order of 20 m when kriging is used and 10 m when kriging is not used, which are less than those with depths of SPT- 200 and Grade-III bedrock. © 2010 ASCE...|$|E

ROC showed 91 % and 88 % constancy with dental pattern in ODI and APDI, respectively. Conclusions: ODI can reliably differentiate deep bite versus normal overbite and deep bite versus open bite. APDI can reliably differentiate dental Class I, II and III malocclusions...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the {{construction}} of a comprehensive set of regional competitiveness indicators for Europe, including the European Union and candidate countries. Various sources have been investigated, included Regio and other Eurostat databases, the OECD Territorial Database, National databases, and data from private bodies, eg trade organisations. The paper covers the main tasks concerned with the construction of the database, and subsequent analysis that has taken place. Firstly, the contents of the various sources of regional data are reviewed and catalogued, with a check on availability, quantity and quality of data. Secondly, the data are classified by separating the various indicators into variables which are essentially measures of the outcome of competitiveness (output indicators, eg GDP per capita) and those which contribute towards this success (inputs). The input indicators are categorised into broad themes, covering basic infrastructure and accessibility, human capital, institutional features, and other factors, eg R&D, innovation demography, property, the information society. The construction of the database is the next major task to be reported, in particular the methods used to construct a system of regional accounts where both breadth (geographical coverage, time period) and <b>depth</b> (<b>indicator</b> coverage) extend upon existing sources. To conclude, some findings from analysis of the data are reported, looking at long-term trends within and across the countries covered. The results from this work have potentially profound implications for the way European regional data are analysed, as the resulting database opens the door for more in-depth analysis of regional competitiveness than has previously been possible...|$|R
