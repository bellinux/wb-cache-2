50|$|For the {{application}} of lens design, two special cases of wave interference are important to account for. In a focal point, rays from a point light source meet again and may constructively or destructively interfere with each other.

The optical path length from the light source is used to compute the phase.

However, the Headquarters for Earthquake Research Promotion concluded that it was not the Miyagi Oki earthquake, saying [...] "...the recent event is not thought to be this earthquake.

50|$|REMPI {{is usually}} {{generated}} by a focused frequency tunable laser beam to form a small-volume plasma. In REMPI, first m photons are simultaneously absorbed by an atom or molecule in the sample {{to bring it to}} an excited state. Other n photons are absorbed afterwards to generate an electron and ion pair. The so-called m+n REMPI is a nonlinear optical process, which can only occur within the focus of the laser beam. A small-volume plasma is formed near the laser <b>focal</b> <b>region.</b> If the energy of m photons does not match any state, an off-resonant transition can occur with an energy defect ΔE, however, the electron is very unlikely to remain in that state. For large detuning, it resides there only during the time Δt. The uncertainty principle is satisfied for Δt, where ћ=h/2π and h is the Planck constant (6.6261×10^-34 J∙s). Such transition and states are called virtual, unlike real transitions to states with long lifetimes.

5000|$|Strokes {{can also}} result from embolisms, furthermore, embolisms block small arteries, causing damage to occur. Spontaneous rupture of a blood vessel {{in the brain}} causes a hemorrhagic stroke. Another form of {{cerebrovascular}} disease includes aneurysms. Cerebral aneurysms can be genetic in nature, due to a wall deformity of the artery. Such aneurysms are common in individuals with genetic diseases ( [...] connective tissue disorders, polycystic kidney disease, and arteriovenous malformations). The carotid arteries cover {{the majority of the}} cerebrum. The common carotid artery divides into the internal and the external carotid arteries. The internal carotid artery becomes the anterior cerebral artery and the middle central artery. The ACA transmits blood to the frontal parietal. From the basilar artery are two posterior cerebral arteries. Branches of the basilar and PCA supply the occipital lobe, brain stem, and the cerebellum. Ischemia is the loss of blood flow to the <b>focal</b> <b>region</b> of the brain. This produces heterogeneous areas of ischemia at the affected vascular region, furthermore blood flow is limited to a residual flow.

5000|$|The beam in {{the cavity}} and the output beam of the laser, when {{traveling}} in free space (or a homogeneous medium) rather than waveguides (as in an optical fiber laser), can be approximated as a Gaussian beam in most lasers; such beams exhibit the minimum divergence {{for a given}} diameter. However some high power lasers may be multimode, with the transverse modes often approximated using Hermite-Gaussian or Laguerre-Gaussian functions. It {{has been shown that}} unstable laser resonators (not used in most lasers) produce fractal shaped beams. Near the beam [...] "waist" [...] (or <b>focal</b> <b>region)</b> it is highly collimated: the wavefronts are planar, normal to the direction of propagation, with no beam divergence at that point. However, due to diffraction, that can only remain true well within the Rayleigh range. The beam of a single transverse mode (gaussian beam) laser eventually diverges at an angle which varies inversely with the beam diameter, as required by diffraction theory. Thus, the [...] "pencil beam" [...] directly generated by a common helium-neon laser would spread out to a size of perhaps 500 kilometers when shone on the Moon (from the distance of the earth). On the other hand, the light from a semiconductor laser typically exits the tiny crystal with a large divergence: up to 50°. However even such a divergent beam can be transformed into a similarly collimated beam by means of a lens system, as is always included, for instance, in a laser pointer whose light originates from a laser diode. That is possible due to the light being of a single spatial mode. This unique property of laser light, spatial coherence, cannot be replicated using standard light sources (except by discarding most of the light) as can be appreciated by comparing the beam from a flashlight (torch) or spotlight to that of almost any laser.|$|E
50|$|We {{mention the}} {{theoretical}} calculation that incomplete ionization occurs whenever there is parallel resonant excitation into a common level with ionization loss. We consider a state such as 6f of Xe whidi consists of 7 quasi-degnerate {{levels in the}} range of the laser bandwidth. These levels along with the continuum constitute a lambda system. The mechanism of the lambda type trapping is schematically presented in figure. At the rising part of the pulse (a) the excited state (with two degenerate levels 1 and 2) are not in multiphoton resonance with the ground state. The electron is ionized through multiphoton coupling with the continuum. As the intensity of the pulse is increased the excited state and the continuum are shifted in energy due to the Stark shift. At the peak of the pulse (b) the excited states go into multiphoton resonance with the ground state. As the intensity starts to decrease (c), the two state are coupled through continuum and the population is trapped in a coherent superposition of the two states. Under subsequent action of the same pulse, due to interference in the transition amplitudes of the lambda system, the field cannot ionize the population completely and a fraction of the population will be trapped in a coherent superposition of the quasi degenerate levels. According to this explanation the states with higher angular momentum- with more sublevels- would have a higher probability of trapping the population. In general the strength of the trapping will be determined by the strength of the two photon coupling between the quasi-degenerate levels via the continuum.In 1996, using the very stable laser and by minimizing the masking effects of the <b>focal</b> <b>region</b> expansion with increasing intensity, Talebpour et al. observed structures on the curves of singly charged ions of Xe, Kr and Ar. These structures were attributed to electron trapping in the strong laser field. A more unambiguous demonstration of population trapping has been reported by T. Morishita and C. D. Lin.|$|E

40|$|The tectonic relief on the <b>focal</b> <b>regions</b> {{of great}} shallow {{earthquakes}} in the circum-Pacific belt {{and its surrounding}} regions is discussed {{in relation to the}} generation mechanism of great earthquakes. In Part I, relationship between the tectonic relief and the occurrence of the great ･earthquake (namely the great fracture) is discussed according to aftershock locations. The result shows that a great fracture suddenly occurs in a unit area or its complex which is bounded by structural discontinuities, such as faults, ridges and trenches. In a sequential occurrence of great earthquakes, a subsequent great fracture propagates from the margin of the adjacent fractured area. In Part II, the "tectonic features of the <b>focal</b> <b>regions</b> of the great shallow earthquakes are discussed in their broader aspects. According to the result, most great earthquakes occur in the tectonically limited regions, characterized mainly by topographical depression: About 64 percent of great earthquakes continuously occurred in ocean-facing slopes of deep sea trenches, about 26 percent occurred in local depressions, such as troughs and ends of trenches, and some singular places in tectonic structures, and only about 8 percent occurred in other tectonic areas.
