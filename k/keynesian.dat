5|$|New classicals {{broke with}} <b>Keynesian</b> {{economic}} theory completely while monetarists had built on <b>Keynesian</b> ideas. Despite discarding <b>Keynesian</b> theory, new classical economists did share the <b>Keynesian</b> focus on explaining short-run fluctuations. New classicals replaced monetarists {{as the primary}} opponents to Keynesianism and changed the primary debate in macroeconomics from whether to look at short-run fluctuations to whether macroeconomic models should be grounded in microeconomic theories. Like monetarism, new classical economics was rooted at the University of Chicago, principally with Robert Lucas. Other leaders {{in the development of}} new classical economics include Edward Prescott at University of Minnesota and Robert Barro at University of Rochester.|$|E
5|$|Among {{professional}} economists {{the revival}} of <b>Keynesian</b> economics has been even more divisive. Although many economists, such as George Akerlof, Paul Krugman, Robert Shiller, and Joseph Stiglitz, supported <b>Keynesian</b> stimulus, others did not believe higher government spending would help the United States economy recover from the Great Recession. Some economists, such as Robert Lucas, questioned the theoretical basis for stimulus packages. Others, like Robert Barro and Gary Becker, say that empirical evidence for beneficial effects from <b>Keynesian</b> stimulus does not exist. However, {{there is a growing}} academic literature that shows that fiscal expansion helps an economy grow in the near term, and that certain types of fiscal stimulus are particularly effective.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 1970s and 1980s, new <b>Keynesian</b> {{researchers}} investigated how market imperfections like monopolistic competition, nominal frictions like sticky prices, and other frictions made microeconomics consistent with <b>Keynesian</b> macroeconomics. New Keynesians often formulated models with rational expectations, {{which had been}} proposed by Lucas and adopted by new classical economists.|$|E

50|$|There was {{debate between}} Monetarists and <b>Keynesians</b> in the 1960s {{over the role}} of {{government}} in stabilizing the economy. Both Monetarists and <b>Keynesians</b> agree that issues such as business cycles, unemployment, and deflation are caused by inadequate demand. However, they had fundamentally different perspectives on the capacity of the economy to find its own equilibrium, and the degree of government intervention that would be appropriate. <b>Keynesians</b> emphasized the use of discretionary fiscal policy and monetary policy, while monetarists argued the primacy of monetary policy, and that it should be rules-based.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1950s new {{classical}} macroeconomists began to disagree with the methodology employed by Keynes and his successors. <b>Keynesians</b> emphasized the dependence of consumption on disposable income and, also, of investment on current profits and current cash flow. In addition, <b>Keynesians</b> posited a Phillips curve that tied nominal wage inflation to unemployment rate. To support these theories, <b>Keynesians</b> typically traced the logical foundations of their model (using introspection) and supported their assumptions with statistical evidence. New classical theorists demanded that macroeconomics be grounded on the same foundations as microeconomic theory, profit-maximizing firms and rational, utility-maximizing consumers.|$|R
5|$|<b>Keynesian</b> {{principles}} fared increasingly {{poorly on}} the practical side of economics – by 1979 {{they had been}} displaced by monetarism as the primary influence on Anglo-American economic policy. However, many officials {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic retained a preference for Keynes, and in 1984 the Federal Reserve officially discarded monetarism, after which <b>Keynesian</b> principles made a partial comeback as an influence on policy making.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Keynesian</b> Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. <b>Keynesian</b> ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing the ideals of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented the ideals of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of <b>Keynesian</b> policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{advent of}} the global {{financial}} crisis of 2007–2008 caused a resurgence in <b>Keynesian</b> thought. <b>Keynesian</b> economics provided the theoretical underpinning for economic policies undertaken {{in response to the}} crisis by President Barack Obama of the United States, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the United Kingdom, and other heads of governments.|$|E

5|$|The {{generation}} of economists that followed Keynes synthesized his theory with neoclassical microeconomics {{to form the}} neoclassical synthesis. Although <b>Keynesian</b> theory originally omitted an explanation of price levels and inflation, later Keynesians adopted the Phillips curve to model price-level changes. Some Keynesians opposed the synthesis method of combining Keynes's theory with an equilibrium system and advocated disequilibrium models instead. Monetarists, led by Milton Friedman, adopted some <b>Keynesian</b> ideas, such as {{the importance of the}} demand for money, but argued that Keynesians ignored the role of money supply in inflation. Robert Lucas and other new classical macroeconomists criticized <b>Keynesian</b> models that did not work under rational expectations. Lucas also argued that <b>Keynesian</b> empirical models would not be as stable as models based on microeconomic foundations.|$|E
5|$|Friedman however {{began to}} emerge as a {{formidable}} critic of <b>Keynesian</b> economics from the mid-1950s, and especially after his 1963 publication of A Monetary History of the United States.|$|E
5|$|Friedman {{suggested}} that sustained <b>Keynesian</b> policies {{could lead to}} both unemployment and inflation rising at once – a phenomenon that soon became known as stagflation. In the early 1970s stagflation appeared in both the US and Britain just as Friedman had predicted, with economic conditions deteriorating further after the 1973 oil crisis. Aided by the prestige gained from his successful forecast, Friedman led increasingly successful criticisms against the <b>Keynesian</b> consensus, convincing not only academics and politicians but also much {{of the general public}} with his radio and television broadcasts. The academic credibility of <b>Keynesian</b> economics was further undermined by additional criticism from other monetarists trained in the Chicago school of economics, by the Lucas critique and by criticisms from Hayek's Austrian School. So successful were these criticisms that by 1980 Robert Lucas claimed economists would often take offence if described as Keynesians.|$|E

50|$|Critics of {{free market}} {{economics}} range {{from those who}} reject markets entirely in favour of a planned economy as advocated by various Marxists, to {{those who wish to}} see market failures regulated to various degrees or supplemented by government interventions. <b>Keynesians</b> support market roles for government, such as using fiscal policy for economic stimulus when actions in the private sector lead to sub-optimal economic outcomes of depressions or recessions. Business cycle theory is used by <b>Keynesians</b> to explain liquidity traps, by which underconsumption occurs, to argue for government intervention with fiscal policy.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{contains}} a {{short history of}} business cycle theory. It is argued that {{in the course of}} time the emphasis shifted from a mainly exogenous to a mainly endogenous explanation of the cycle. After the integration of the two approaches in the so-called impulse and propagation theory, the balance kept shifting between an emphasis on endogenous propagation mechanism (<b>Keynesians),</b> the exogenous impulse mechanism (New Classicals) and back again to the propagation mechanism (New <b>Keynesians).</b> The shifts in emphasis in theory are accompanied by changes in the perceived window of opportunity for economic policy.

5|$|Historian Peter Pugh {{has stated}} that a key cause of the {{economic}} problems afflicting America in the 1970s was the refusal to raise taxes to finance the Vietnam War, which was against <b>Keynesian</b> advice.|$|E
5|$|Keynes did not lay out an {{explicit}} theory of price level. Early <b>Keynesian</b> models assumed wage and other price levels were fixed. These assumptions caused little {{concern in the}} 1950s when inflation was stable, but by the mid-1960s inflation increased and became an issue for macroeconomic models. In 1958 A.W. Phillips set {{the basis for a}} price level theory when he made the empirical observation that inflation and unemployment seemed to be inversely related. In 1960 Richard Lipsey provided the first theoretical explanation of this correlation. Generally <b>Keynesian</b> explanations of the curve held that excess demand drove high inflation and low unemployment while an output gap raised unemployment and depressed prices. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the Phillips curve faced attacks on both empirical and theoretical fronts. The presumed trade-off between output and inflation represented by the curve was the weakest part of the <b>Keynesian</b> system.|$|E

50|$|Non-revolutionary socialists were {{inspired}} by the writings of John Stuart Mill, and later John Maynard Keynes and the <b>Keynesians,</b> who provided theoretical justification for state involvement in existing market economies. According to the <b>Keynesians,</b> if business cycles could be smoothed out by national ownership of key industries and state direction of their investment, class antagonism would be effectively tamed.They argue that a compact would form between labour and the capitalist class and {{that there would be}} no need for revolution. Joan Robinson and Michael Kalecki formed the basis of a critical post-Keynesian economics that at times went well beyond liberal reformism.|$|R
50|$|This analysis, while disputed by <b>Keynesians</b> (who {{argue that}} the effects of fiscal {{stimulus}} are more significant than Friedman argues), is considered a legitimate approach, and not dismissed out of hand as wrong-headed.|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} fields of macroeconomic research is economic policy. Economic theory offers policymakers advice, suggestions, and frameworks for projecting and realizing economic policy. Economists, however, disagree substantially over many questions concerning this issue. The opinions vary as to the effectiveness of monetary and fiscal policy and their role in economic stability. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present different views on monetary and fiscal policy in different schools of economic thought. Only the mainstream schools were considered, such as <b>Keynesians,</b> Monetarists, New Classical School, economists of the Real Business Cycle and New <b>Keynesians.</b> It is worth noticing that in spite of some differences there are also many similarities between them. We believe that a consensus in the field of economic policy has emerged. It encompasses monetary neutrality in the long run, monetary nature of inflation, increased monetary policy in the recent years and doubts about fiscal policy effectiveness as a tool of stabilisation. Moreover, it seems probable that macroeconomics is moving toward a New Neoclassical Synthesis, which melds New <b>Keynesians</b> and the Real Business Cycle theories...|$|R
5|$|Criticisms of Keynes's ideas {{had begun}} to gain {{significant}} acceptance by the early 1970s, as they were then {{able to make a}} credible case that <b>Keynesian</b> models no longer reflected economic reality. Keynes himself included few formulas and no explicit mathematical models in his General Theory. For economists such as Hyman Minsky, Keynes's limited use of mathematics was partly the result of his scepticism about whether phenomena as inherently uncertain as economic activity could ever be adequately captured by mathematical models. Nevertheless, many models were developed by <b>Keynesian</b> economists, with a famous example being the Phillips curve which predicted an inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation. It implied that unemployment could be reduced by government stimulus with a calculable cost to inflation. In 1968 Milton Friedman published a paper arguing that the fixed relationship implied by the Philips curve did not exist.|$|E
5|$|In 1976 Lucas wrote a paper criticizing {{large-scale}} <b>Keynesian</b> models {{used for}} forecasting and policy evaluation. Lucas argued that economic models based on empirical relationships between variables are unstable as policies change: a relationship under one policy regime may be invalid after the regime changes. The Lucas's critique went further {{and argued that}} a policy's impact is determined by how the policy alters the expectations of economic agents. No model is stable unless it accounts for expectations and how expectations relate to policy. New classical economists argued that abandoning the disequilibrium models of Keynesianism and focusing on structure- and behavior-based equilibrium models would remedy these faults. <b>Keynesian</b> economists responded by building models with microfoundations grounded in stable theoretical relationships.|$|E
5|$|Milton Friedman {{developed}} {{an alternative to}} <b>Keynesian</b> macroeconomics eventually labeled monetarism. Generally monetarism {{is the idea that}} the supply of money matters for the macroeconomy. When monetarism emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, Keynesians neglected the role money played in inflation and the business cycle, and monetarism directly challenged those points.|$|E
50|$|A {{suggested}} {{reason for}} the distortion is the central role John Hicks's IS/LM model played in helping other economists understand Keynes's theory - for post <b>Keynesians,</b> and by the 1970s even Hicks himself, the model distorted Keynes's vision.|$|R

5|$|New {{classical}} economics {{had pointed}} out the inherent contradiction of the neoclassical synthesis: Walrasian microeconomics with market clearing and general equilibrium could not lead to <b>Keynesian</b> macroeconomics where markets failed to clear. New Keynesians recognized this paradox, but, while the new classicals abandoned Keynes, new Keynesians abandoned Walras and market clearing.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} major bailouts were pursued during the {{financial}} crisis, starting on 7 September with {{the announcement that}} the U.S. Government was to nationalise the two government-sponsored enterprises which oversaw most of the U.S. subprime mortgage market – Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In October, Alistair Darling, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, referred to Keynes as he announced plans for substantial fiscal stimulus to head off the worst effects of recession, in accordance with <b>Keynesian</b> economic thought. Similar policies have been adopted by other governments worldwide.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, <b>Keynesian</b> {{policies}} were adopted by {{almost the entire}} developed world and similar measures for a mixed economy were used by many developing nations. By then, Keynes's views on the economy had become mainstream in the world's universities. Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, the developed and emerging free capitalist economies enjoyed exceptionally high growth and low unemployment. Professor Gordon Fletcher has written that the 1950s and 1960s, when Keynes's influence was at its peak, appear in retrospect as a golden age of capitalism.|$|E
50|$|To <b>Keynesians,</b> {{unemployment}} insurance {{acts as an}} automatic stabilizer. Benefits automatically increase when unemployment is high and fall when unemployment is low, smoothing the business cycle; however, others claim that the taxation necessary to support this system serves to decrease employment.|$|R
5|$|New <b>Keynesians</b> offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not to work because wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new <b>Keynesians</b> were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|R
