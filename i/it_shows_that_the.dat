Data from the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder (CVR) were downloaded by the National Transportation Safety Board in the United States commencing July 20 and 23 respectively. Based on preliminary data from the FDR, on July 25 Airbus cautioned A320 operators to ensure that both thrust levers are set to idle during flare. The transcript of the CVR was released on August 1. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> pilots were aware of the wet runway conditions and the deactivated thrust reverser. The pilots' comments suggest that the spoilers did not deploy and that they were unable to slow the aircraft. Crew error has not been ruled out.|$|E

25|$|Formally, {{the joint}} {{hypothesis}} problem {{says that it}} is never possible to test (sufficiently, to prove or disprove) market efficiency. A test of market efficiency must include some model for how prices may be set efficiently. Then actual prices can be examined to see whether this holds true. Usually this fails and then this supports the case that markets are not efficient.

25|$|Many {{consequences}} of the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem seemed counterintuitive to logicians in the early 20th century, as the distinction between first-order and non-first-order properties was not yet understood. One such consequence is the existence of uncountable models of true arithmetic, which satisfy every first-order induction axiom but have non-inductive subsets. Another consequence that was considered particularly troubling is {{the existence of a}} countable model of set theory, which nevertheless must satisfy the sentence saying the real numbers are uncountable. This counterintuitive situation {{came to be known as}} Skolem's paradox; <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> notion of countability is not absolute.|$|E

25|$|On April 9, 2015, the Öberg Astrochemistry Group {{published}} a paper stating they detected the first complex carbon molecule in a protoplanetary disk, this molecule being methyl cyanide. Methyl cyanide (CH3CN) {{is thought to}} be important for the origins of life because it contains carbon-nitrogen bonds, which make up amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Up until this discovery, it was unclear if these molecules could exist in abundance in young disks because of their turbulent and chaotic nature. Using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Öberg’s group was able to survey the orbital debris of the newly formed star MWC 480, to discover enough methyl cyanide to fill all of Earth’s oceans and the presence of other simpler molecules such as hydrogen cyanide. This discovery is significant because <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> backbone of life, complex carbon bonds, are not exclusive to our universe. In an interview, Öberg stated that comet records suggest the presence of complex organic molecules in other protoplanetary disks as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{relative}} age {{and nature}} of intercrater plains material are as uncertain in the Borealis region as they are elsewhere on Mercury. Strom noted the similarity in surficial morphologies between mercurian intercrater plains and pre-Imbrian pitted plains south-southwest of Mare Nectaris on the Moon (Wilhelms and McCauley, 1971; Scott, 1972). The pits in the lunar pre-Imbrian pitted plains {{are similar to the}} small secondaries that pepper the surface of Mercurian intercrater plains material. On the Moon, pre-Imbrian pitted plains material embays the Janssen Formation (Scott, 1972), whose base is defined as the base of the Nectarian System (Stuart-Alexander and Wilhelms, 1975). However, the crater density of the intercrater plains material in the Borealis region matches that of an area {{on the far side of}} the Moon, in the region northwest of crater Tsiolkovskiy bounded by crater Mendeleev and Mare Smithii. This area is dominated by pre-Nectarian unmantled terra and pre-Nectarian and Nectarian craters (Wilhelms and El- Baz, 1977). The similarity in crater density of intercrater plains material on Mercury and of pre-Nectarian terrain on the Moon is geologically significant, inasmuch as <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> oldest recognizable surfaces on both Mercury and the Moon went through similar stages of crustal cratering, but not necessarily at the same absolute geologic time. Differences in crater density as well as embayment relations in the Borealis region show that the intercrater plains material and the smoother intermediate plains material are younger than many craters in the area northeast of crater Turgenev, and older than smooth plains material in Borealis Planitia.|$|E
500|$|A {{thorough}} {{study of the}} emendations that Schubert edited into the final versions, in comparison with his sketches, reveals many insights. [...] "Examination of Schubert's sketches for the sonatas reveals him as highly self-critical; moreover, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'heavenly lengths' of the sonatas were actually a later addition, not conceived from the start. In his subsequent corrections, Schubert elaborated on his themes and expanded them, giving them more 'musical space'", in Alfred Brendel's words. In the revision, Brendel continues, [...] "proportions are rectified, details start to tell, fermatas suspend time. Rests clarify the structure, allowing breathing space, holding the breath or listening into silence".|$|E

500|$|The {{treaty is}} {{important}} for several reasons. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Lithuanian Dukes were co-operating; the signatories include Dukes who ruled lands such as Samogitia, which probably had no contact with Galicia–Volhynia. Their participation implies a perception of common interest, an indication of a nascent state. However, the designation of five Dukes as [...] "elder" [...] shows {{that the process of}} unification was still in transition. The inclusion of 21 Dukes indicates that the various lands in Lithuania were powerful and semi-independent. Historians consider the treaty an interesting documentation of the long and complex process of a state's formation. The progress of unification was uneven; for example, after the deaths of Dukes Daugirutis in 1213 and Stekšys in 1214, fewer raids were organized by Lithuanians.|$|E

In {{a column for}} Jazz Times, Tony Green wrote that [...] "OutKast's Aquemini dispels any notion that hip-hop is out of sonic ideas. If anything, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> genre's appetite for new sounds is as ravenous as ever." [...] According to Emma Warren from The Guardian, this album is [...] "a high point of 90s hip-hop" [...] and proof that [...] "the old push and pull between {{the east and west}} coast of American hip-hop was over". Tim Stelloh of PopMatters felt that [...] "Aquemini far surpassed OutKast's previous release ATLiens , and made the group one of those rare commercial anomalies—kind of like Nirvana, Rage Against the Machine, or Public Enemy". Several reviewers of Kendrick Lamar's Good Kid, M.A.A.D City (2012) perceived influence from Aquemini in the record's production and aesthetic.|$|E
500|$|The Nemegtomaia {{specimen}} MPC-D 107/15 {{was found}} {{associated with a}} nest with eggs; its feet {{were placed in the}} centre of what was probably a ring of eggs, with the arms folded across the tops of the eggs {{on each side of the}} body, a posture similar to what is seen in other fossils of brooding oviraptorids. The collected part of the nest is about 90cm (35in) wide and 100cm (30in) long; the skeleton occupies the upper 25cm (10in) of the block, whereas the remaining 20cm (8in) is occupied by broken eggs and shells. There is no evidence of plant material in the nest, but there are fragments of undetermined bones. The nest does not preserve any complete eggs or embryos, which prevents determination of the size, shape, number, and arrangement of the eggs in the nest. It is probable that there were originally two layers of eggs below the body, and there do not appear to have been eggs in the centre of the nest. Most eggs (seven distinct eggs have been identified) and egg fragments were recovered either in the lower layer of the nest or under the skull, neck, and limbs of the specimen, and the bones either rested directly on the eggs or were within 5mm (0.2in) of their surfaces. That the skeleton was directly positioned on top of <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> nest was not completely covered by sand. Though the placement of the eggs does not suggest a specific arrangement in the nest, most other oviraptorid nests show that the eggs were arranged in pairs in up to three levels of concentric circles. The eggs of MPC-D107/15 were therefore most likely displaced during burial, or by external factors, such as strong winds, sandstorms, or predators. This also supports the idea that the upper layer of eggs was not buried, as fully buried eggs would have been less likely to be transported by external factors.|$|E
