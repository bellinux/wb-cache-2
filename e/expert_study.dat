[...] A world class study the key global figures of Expressionism and Neoexpressionism, from the Museum of Modern Art Salzburg, identified Rando as one of the best examples of neo-expressionism in the world. The <b>expert</b> <b>study</b> selected only Rando and Miguel Barceló as the only two representatives of this artistic movement in Spain. Therefore, in recognition to Rando's fruitful artistic career, the first Expressionist Museum in Spain bears his name Museum Jorge Rando. Currently, the painter lives and works between Malaga, Spain and Hamburg, Germany; countries where his artistic legacy has been widely recognized. The Museum Jorge Rando was inaugurated in Malaga,Spain in 2014 the city is the painter´s hometown, which in recent years has become a new cultural star in Europe, due to its growing number of outstanding contemporary art museums.

5000|$|Osiander's letter {{stated that}} Copernicus' system was {{mathematics}} intended to aid computation {{and not an}} attempt to declare literal truth: {{it is the duty}} of an astronomer to compose the history of the celestial motions through careful and <b>expert</b> <b>study.</b> Then he must conceive and devise the causes of these motions or hypotheses about them. Since he cannot in any way attain to the true causes, he will adopt whatever suppositions enable the motions to be computed correctly ... The present author has performed both these duties excellently. For these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable. On the contrary, if they provide a calculus consistent with the observations, that alone is enough ... For this art, it is quite clear, is completely and absolutely ignorant of the causes of the apparent of the heavens. And if any causes are devised by the imagination, as indeed very many are, they are not put forward to convince anyone that they are true, but merely to provide a reliable basis for computation. However, since different hypotheses are sometimes offered for one and the same ... the astronomer will take as his first choice that hypothesis which is the easiest to grasp. The philosopher will perhaps rather seek the semblance of the truth. But neither of them will understand or state anything certain, unless it has been divinely revealed to him ... Let no one expect anything certain from astronomy, which cannot furnish it, lest he accept as the truth ideas conceived for another purpose, and depart this study a greater fool than when he entered. As even Osiander's defenders point out, the Ad lectorem [...] "expresses views on the aim and nature of scientific theories at variance with Copernicus' claims for his own theory".|$|E
