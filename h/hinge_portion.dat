40|$|AbstractThis paper {{compares the}} {{functional}} properties of ion channels formed in planar lipid membranes by {{the wild and}} mutant Staphylococcus aureus α-toxin. It was shown that replacement of the amino acid Gly at position 130 by Cys in the primary structure of the toxin decreases the single-channel conductance with a concomitant decrease in the pH at which the channel becomes unable to discriminate between Cl− and K+ ions. The mutation also induced {{an increase in the}} asymmetry in the current–voltage relationship of the channel. The results of our experiments suggest that the trans-mouth of the channel is responsible for all the observed changes in channel properties. It was assumed that this entrance is built by the glycine-rich <b>hinge</b> <b>portion</b> of the toxin and is situated close to the surface of monolayer facing the trans-compartment...|$|E
40|$|An {{intumescent}} material {{fire stop}} device, comprising a support body shaped {{so as to}} take a collar-like shape around an axis and to define an opening intended to house a pipe, an expandable element, made up {{of at least one}} intumescent material and positioned in the support body, and one or more foldable fin joined to the support body by at least one respective <b>hinge</b> <b>portion</b> along a radially inner peripheral edge of said opening. Due to the expansion of the expandable element, the fins are movable between an initial position, in which the fins are substantially parallel to each other and not intercepting said opening, to a closing position, in which the fins converge towards the axis to close at least partially the opening. Advantageously the expandable element is made of at least one first intumescent material, expandable at temperatures equal to or greater than a first activation temperature T 1, and at least one second intumescent material, expandable at temperatures equal to or greater than a second activation temperature T 2 higher than said first activation temperature T 1. The first intumescent material and the second intumescent material are axially staggered...|$|E
40|$|In our {{previous}} study, gas-phase hydrazinolysis {{was used to}} analyze the glycoform of the O-linked oligosaccharide of human serum IgAl. All O-linked oligosaccharide chains are known to be present in the <b>hinge</b> <b>portion.</b> However, the number of O-linked oligosaccharide chains on IgAl remained unclear. In order to determine the number of linked sugar chains, we applied matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOFMS) to the hinge glycopeptide prepared from human serum IgAl. MALDI-TOFMS did not show clear peaks, probably due to the microheterogeneity of the structure of each sugar chain. However, elimination of peripheral sialic acid and galactose residues by sequential treatment with neuraminidase and> 9 -galactosidase gave clear mass spectra with several sharp peaks. On the basis of these spectra, we conclude that IgAl prepared from normal human serum carries different numbers of sugar chains. There are two major populations, one contains five GalNAc residues and the other four GalNAc residues. On the other hand, the hinge glycopeptide prepared from myeloma IgAl was composed mainly of one population containing four GalNAc residues. Earlier, we reported incomplete glycosyl-ation of IgAl isolated from the serum of an IgAl myeloma patient. In this experiment, th...|$|E

25|$|The canopy stayed {{essentially}} {{the same as that of}} the E-4, although the handbook for the 'F' stipulated that the forward, lower triangular panel to starboard was to be replaced by a metal panel with a port for firing signal flares. Many F-1s and F-2s kept this section glazed. A two-piece, all-metal armour plate head shield was added, as on the E-4, to the <b>hinged</b> <b>portion</b> of the canopy, although some lacked the curved top section. A bullet-resistant windscreen could be fitted as an option. The fuel tank was self-sealing, and around 1942 Bf 109Fs were retrofitted with additional armour made from layered light-alloy plate just aft of the pilot and fuel tank.

40|$|Numerous {{iron ore}} {{deposits}} are hosted within the Meso to Neo-Archean banded iron formations (BIFs) extending across the Singhbhum-Orissa Craton, eastern India. Despite the widespread distribution of BIFs, which forms {{part of the}} iron ore group (IOG), heterogeneity in their grade and mineral composition is occasionally observed even within a single ore deposit. Kiriburu-Meghahatuburu iron ore deposit (KMIOD), west Singhbhum district, Jharkhand, eastern India {{is characterized by a}} dominant hematite (often martitized) occurrence with a total resource of > 150 million tonnes (MT) at 62. 85 wt % Fe. Very high-grade blue dust ore (friable and powdery hematitewith~ 67 % Fe), high-grade massive, hard laminated hematitic ores (~ 66 % Fe) and medium to low grade goethitic/lateritic ores (50 %– 60 % Fe) are the common iron-ore lithologies in KMIOD. These ores can be distinguished in the field from their physical appearance, meso-scale texture and spatial occurrences with the host rocks along with the variation in chemical composition. The high-grade ores are characterized by high Fe (> 62 wt %), low Al 2 O 3 (1. 5 – 2. 5 wt %), low SiO 2 (2. 0 – 4. 5 wt %) and low P (< 0. 06 wt %). Detailed field studies and laboratory investigations on the ore mineral assemblages suggest that the mineralization of high-grade iron ores at KMIOD is controlled by three major parameters, i. e., lithological, paleoclimatic and structural controls. High-grade iron ores such as blue dust seem to be formed during leaching processes through inter-bedded ferruginous shale and banded hematite jasper (BHJ) occurring within BIFs. Structural elements such as folds, joint network, fracture arrays, local faults and steeply dipping bedding planes are surmised as strong controls for the evolution of different iron ore types from the BHJ. Most of the high-grade ores are concentrated at the <b>hinge</b> <b>portions</b> of second generation folds (F 2) owing to the easy access for circulation of meteoric solution along the fractures developed due to release of stresses at the <b>hinge</b> <b>portions</b> aided by supergene ore enrichment processes. The BHJ and interbedded ferruginous shale seem to have been given a significant contribution for the formation of different grades of iron ores over the area. Lithologically, the BIFs are governed by rheological features providing channel ways in the ore enrichment process. The variation in the iron ore mineralogy is caused by the variation in depositional and paleoclimatic environment, structural setting and lithological attributes. Hence, these parameters could be used for future exploration and grade recovery of iron ore resources in the region and in the adjoining areas...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infects African {{green monkey}} kidney cells via HAV {{cellular}} receptor 1 (havcr- 1). The ectodomain of havcr- 1 contains an N-terminal cysteine-rich immunoglobulin-like region (D 1), {{followed by a}} mucin-like region that extends D 1 well above the cell surface. D 1 is required for binding of HAV, and a soluble construct containing D 1 fused to the <b>hinge</b> and Fc <b>portions</b> of human immunoglobulin G 1 (IgG 1), D 1 -Fc, bound and neutralized HAV inefficiently. However, D 1 -Fc did not alter the virions. To determine whether additional regions of havcr- 1 are required to trigger uncoating of HAV, we constructed D 1 muc-Fc containing D 1 and two-thirds of the mucin-like region fused to the Fc and <b>hinge</b> <b>portions</b> of human IgG 1. D 1 muc-Fc neutralized 10 times more HAV than did D 1 -Fc. Sedimentation analysis in sucrose gradients showed that treatment of HAV with 20 to 200 nM D 1 muc-Fc disrupted {{the majority of the}} virions, whereas treatment with 2 nM D 1 muc-Fc had no effect on the sedimentation of the particles. Treatment of HAV with 100 nM D 1 muc-Fc resulted in low-level accumulation of 100 - to 125 S particles. Negative-stain electron microscopy analysis revealed that the 100 - to 125 S particles had the characteristics of disrupted virions, such as internal staining and diffuse edges. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that the 100 - to 125 S particles contained viral RNA. These results indicate that D 1 and the mucin-like region of havcr- 1 are required to induce conformational changes leading to HAV uncoating...|$|R

40|$|Poliovirus infects {{susceptible}} cells {{through the}} poliovirus receptor (PVR), which functions to bind virus {{and to change}} its conformation. These two activities {{are thought to be}} necessary for efficient poliovirus infection. How binding and conformation conversion activities contribute to the establishment of poliovirus infection was investigated. Mouse L cells expressing mouse high-affinity Fcγ receptor molecules were established and used to study poliovirus infection mediated by mouse antipoliovirus monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (immunoglobulin G 2 a [IgG 2 a] subtypes) or PVR-IgG 2 a, a chimeric molecule consisting of the extracellular moiety of PVR and the <b>hinge</b> and Fc <b>portion</b> of mouse IgG 2 a. The antibodies and PVR-IgG 2 a showed the same degree of affinity for poliovirus, but the infectivities mediated by these molecules were different. Among the molecules tested, PVR-IgG 2 a mediated the infection most efficiently, showing 50 - to 100 -fold-higher efficiency than that attained with the different MAbs. A conformational change of poliovirus was induced only by PVR-IgG 2 a. These results strongly suggested that some specific interaction(s) between poliovirus and the PVR is required for high-level infectivity of poliovirus in this system...|$|R
5000|$|The {{feeding pattern}} of the wood frog, {{basically}} {{similar to that of}} other ranids, is triggered by prey movement and consists of a bodily lunge that terminates with the mouth opening and an extension of the tongue onto the prey. The ranid tongue is attached {{to the floor of the}} mouth near the tip of the jaw, and when the mouth is closed, the tongue lies flat, extended posteriorly from its point of attachment. In the feeding strike, the tongue is swung forward as though on a <b>hinge,</b> so some <b>portion</b> of the normally dorsal and posterior tongue surface makes contact with the prey. At this point in the feeding strike, the wood frog differs markedly from more aquatic Lithobates species, such as the green frog, leopard frog, and bullfrog. The wood frog makes contact with the prey with just the tip of its tongue, much like a toad. [...] A more extensive amount of tongue surface is applied in the feeding strikes of these other frog species, with the result that usually the prey is engulfed by the fleshy tongue and considerable tongue surface contacts the surrounding substrate.|$|R

40|$|The {{entry of}} ecotropic and amphotropic murine leukemia retroviruses (MuLV) into cells was {{investigated}} by using viral vector particles carrying chimeric amphotropic-ecotropic envelope glycoproteins on their surface. Chimeras {{were made by}} joining, {{at or near the}} polyproline <b>hinge,</b> the N-terminal <b>portion</b> of the amphotropic (4070 A) gp 7 O onto the C-terminal portion of the ecotropic (Moloney) gp 7 O and pl 5 E (constructs AE 2 and AE 4) or vice versa (AE 12). Transduction efficiency of the constructs was tested on target cells that either have only ecotropic receptors (CHO- 2 and CHO- 11 cells), only amphotropic receptors (mink lung fibroblasts and Cos 1 cells), or both types of receptors (NIH 3 T 3 cells). The assay made use {{of the fact that the}} mechanism for viral entry of ecotropic viruses is pH dependent while that of amphotropic viruses is pH independent. Treatment of target cells with NH 4 C 1, which prevents the reduction of pH within endosomes, reduced the titers of viral particles bearing the C-terminal moiety from the ecotropic envelope but did not reduce the titers of particles which had a C-terminal moiety from the amphotropic envelope. In addition, in contrast to other low-pH-dependent enveloped viruses, brief acid treatment did not allow surface-bound viruses to bypass the NH 4 Cl block. The results indicate that the pH dependence of viral entry is a property of the sequences C terminal to the polyproline hinge. Retroviral transduction efficiency reflects the success o...|$|R
40|$|Hepatitis A virus (HAV) infects African {{green monkey}} kidney (AGMK) cells via the HAV {{cellular}} receptor- 1 (havcr- 1), a mucin-like type 1 integral-membrane glycoprotein of unknown natural function. The ectodomain of havcr- 1 contains an N-terminal immunoglobulin-like cysteine-rich region (D 1), which binds protective monoclonal antibody (MAb) 190 / 4, {{followed by an}} O-glycosylated mucin-like threonine-serine-proline-rich region that extends D 1 well above the cell surface. To study the interaction of HAV with havcr- 1, we constructed immunoadhesins fusing the <b>hinge</b> and Fc <b>portion</b> of human IgG 1 to D 1 (D 1 -Fc) or the ectodomain of the poliovirus receptor (PVR-Fc) and expressed them in CHO cells. These immunoadhesins were secreted to the cell culture medium and purified through protein A-agarose columns. In a solid-phase assay, HAV bound to D 1 -Fc in a concentration-dependent manner whereas background levels of HAV bound to PVR-Fc. Binding of HAV to D 1 -Fc was blocked by treatment with MAb 190 / 4 but not with control MAb M 2, which binds to a tag epitope introduced between the D 1 and Fc portions of the immunoadhesin. D 1 -Fc neutralized approximately 1 log unit of the HAV infectivity in AGMK cells, whereas PVR-Fc had no effect in the HAV titers. A similarly poor reduction in HAV titers was observed after treating the same stock of HAV with murine neutralizing MAbs K 2 - 4 F 2, K 3 - 4 C 8, and VHA 813. Neutralization of poliovirus by PVR-Fc but not by D 1 -Fc indicated that the virus-receptor interactions were specific. These results show that D 1 is sufficient for binding and neutralization of HAV and provide further evidence that havcr- 1 is a functional cellular receptor for HAV...|$|R
