This study used a phenomenographic approach {{to examine the}} various purposes a sample of 26 New Zealand teachers ascribed to assessment. Seven purposes were discussed: compliance, external reporting, reporting to parents, extrinsically motivating students, organising group instruction, teacher use for <b>individualising</b> <b>learning,</b> and joint teacher-student use for <b>individualising</b> <b>learning.</b> This study showed that teachers held complex conceptions of assessment and described using different assessments for differing purposes.

50|$|Following {{the arrival}} of {{multimedia}} CALL, multimedia language centres {{began to appear in}} educational institutions. While multimedia facilities offer many opportunities for language learning with the integration of text, images, sound and video, these opportunities have often not been fully utilised. One of the main promises of CALL is the ability to <b>individualise</b> <b>learning</b> but, as with the language labs that were introduced into educational institutions in the 1960s and 1970s, the use of the facilities of multimedia centres has often devolved into rows of students all doing the same drills (Davies 2010: Section 3.1). There is therefore a danger that multimedia centres may go {{the same way as the}} language labs. Following a boom period in the 1970s, language labs went rapidly into decline. Davies (1997: p. 28) lays the blame mainly on the failure to train teachers to use language labs, both in terms of operation and in terms of developing new methodologies, but there were other factors such as poor reliability, lack of materials and a lack of good ideas.|$|R

40|$|Background. Having many dyadic {{interactions}} with the teacher is beneficial for student learning. Yet, {{little is known about}} how many interactions students have with their teachers and how variability in interaction frequency can be explained. Aims. Three main objectives are addressed: (1) describing the range of the initiation of interaction and the total interaction frequency in secondary classrooms, (2) exploring whether differences in interaction frequency are due to teachers, students, or specific teacher-student dyads, and (3) explaining differences in interaction frequency by teacher characteristics, student characteristics and dyad characteristics. Sample. All dyadic teacher-student interactions of 104 students and 31 teachers during two school weeks. All possible teacher-student dyads were included in the sample. Methods. Interactions were recorded, and coded as teacher or student-initiated. Teacher (years of experience and gender), student (achievement, gender, and engagement), and relationship (student gender with teacher gender and subject) characteristics were used as predictors in a social relations model. Results. Hardly any students did not interact with a teacher during seatwork during an average lesson hour. Variability in interaction frequency mainly depended on the specific teacher-student pairing. Furthermore, we found that teacher gender, achievement, and the relation between teacher gender and student gender were predictive of interaction frequency. Practical implications. Our findings can raise awareness among teachers about which students have the least interactions, and that their relationship contributes the most to the fact that these students have the least interactions. Our findings provide insights into how teachers can create opportunities to <b>individualise</b> <b>learning</b> by making them attentive of the current situation...|$|R

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this paper is concerned with the development of a computational basis for the creation of constructivist learning environments capable of evaluating the process of interaction between the learner and the environment and promoting effective <b>individualised</b> <b>learning</b> based on these evaluations.

40|$|The {{present study}} aims to explore {{in what way}} {{teachers}} at upper secondary level work in a diverse classroom with particular focus on the student's heterogeneous knowledge of the English language. This heterogeneity, the participants experience, is primarily caused by the discrepancy between those students who use English {{to a great extent}} outside the classroom through, for example, frequently playing computer games, and those students who do not use the English language at all outside a school context. In order to explore this aim, a pilot study was conducted where five teachers at upper secondary level were interviewed. The results show that this heterogeneity is their most challenging part of working as English teachers today. It thus adds to other factors, such as, multiculturalism, multilingualism, difficulties with reading and writing etc. and makes it an even more dificult task for teachers to support every student's <b>individualised</b> <b>learning.</b> The results futher show that despite the teachers' attempts to differentiate the English education, there is a lack of, and need for, strategies that are useful to support an <b>individualised</b> <b>learning</b> in a heterogeneous classroom. ...|$|E

It presents a case study of a program which aimed to prepare students for their Year 10 equivalent school leaving qualification in a basic education section of a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) college in Australia. Most of the students were between 15 and 17 years of age, had experienced literacy and numeracy difficulties in formal learning, and for various reasons were disconnected from the school system. The paper explains how an approach to learning in VET led to important human and social capital outcomes, and in particular, a changed sense of efficacy on the part of students in the program. The two key elements of this VET pedagogy were: <b>individualised,</b> self-paced <b>learning</b> within a flexible program structure; and the fostering of social capital, including mutual trust and respect, through the course-related learning network of teachers and students and other influential networks, including peer networks.
