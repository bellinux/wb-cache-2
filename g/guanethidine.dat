5000|$|Dosulepin can potentiate {{the effects}} of alcohol {{and at least one}} death has been {{attributed}} to this combination.

Dosulepin may have its postural hypotensive effects potentiated by diuretics. Anticonvulsants may have their efficacy reduced by dosulepin due to its ability to reduce the seizure threshold.|$|E
40|$|The early hypotensive {{action of}} {{intravenous}} <b>guanethidine</b> in rabbits, rats and cats anaesthetized with urethane is reversed after pretreatment with iproniazid. The fall {{in blood pressure}} following injection of <b>guanethidine</b> in rabbits is reduced after previous administration of reserpine. Reserpine, like adrenalectomy and splenectomy, suppresses the early pressor effect of <b>guanethidine</b> in cats anaesthetized with chloralose. <b>Guanethidine</b> inhibits the action of tyramine and nicotine, but potentiates the effect of noradrenaline on isolated rabbit atria. <b>Guanethidine</b> is also a weak inhibitor of monoamine oxidase activity.

40|$|Complex {{regional}} pain {{syndrome is}} often {{treated with the}} sympatholytic <b>guanethidine</b> and a local anesthetic in a Bier's block. The efficacy of this treatment has been questioned. Because local anesthetics inhibit the norepinephrine uptake transporter, we hypothesized that this variable efficacy results from the local inhibiting the uptake of <b>guanethidine.</b> In this study, we tested this hypothesis by using a sympathetically innervated mouse vas deferens preparation. Organ bath-mounted mouse vasa deferentia were electrically stimulated in the absence and presence of <b>guanethidine,</b> prilocaine, procaine, and cocaine in various combinations. Prilocaine (1 mM) induced an immediate inhibition of twitch response (maximum 100 % after 2 min) that fully reversed after washing. <b>Guanethidine</b> (3 microM) also inhibited twitching by 95 % +/- 3 % in 15 min, but this effect was only partially reversed after 1 h of washing (33 % +/- 12 % of control). When prilocaine and <b>guanethidine</b> were added in combination, a reversal of 80 % +/- 13 % (at 1 h) was observed. Procaine (300 micro M) produced a transient increase (152 % +/- 14 %) in response. When co-incubated with <b>guanethidine</b> (3 microM), the twitch was reduced to 24 % +/- 4 % of control and was reversed to 77 % +/- 7 % after 1 h. Cocaine (30 microM) inhibited the twitch response to 53 % +/- 8 %, which was fully reversed by 1 h of washing. When co-incubated with <b>guanethidine,</b> the response was reduced to 39 % +/- 6 % of control and was reversed to 86 % +/- 10 % after 1 h. In all cases, the reversal produced by the combination was significantly more intense (P < 0. 05) than that produced by <b>guanethidine</b> alone. Local anesthetics reduce the sympatholytic actions of <b>guanethidine,</b> and this may explain the variable efficacy of <b>guanethidine</b> {{in the treatment of}} complex regional pain syndrome...|$|E

40|$|<b>Guanethidine,</b> {{acting on}} the rat {{isolated}} anococcygeus, causes adrenergic neurone blockade (slowly terminated by washing), noradrenaline potentiation and, with higher concentrations, spasm (both rapidly terminated by washing). 2 The spasm is an indirect sympathomimetic action, for it is sensitive to phentolamine and reserpine and shows tachyphylaxis. 3 The concentration of cocaine equieffective with the spasmogenic concentration of <b>guanethidine</b> as an inhibitor of noradrenaline uptake caused much less spasm. Moreover, it did not enhance noradrenaline efflux from anococcygeus loaded with (-) -[3 H]-noradrenaline, as <b>guanethidine</b> did. 4 The spasm induced by <b>guanethidine</b> in excess of cocaine is due to guanethidine-evoked noradrenaline release...|$|E
40|$|A {{single dose}} of <b>guanethidine</b> {{produces}} a substantial, long-lasting depletion of tissue catecholamines in the rat, whereas a similar dose of bretylium has no effect. Both drugs produce block of the eserine-induced sympathetic pressor effect. Block by <b>guanethidine</b> is induced {{more rapidly than}} is amine depletion. When amine depletion is maximal, a noradrenaline infusion is capable of restoring the response to eserine, but no restoration of the response to eserine occurs after noradrenaline infusion into bretylium-treated rats. Catecholamine levels in isolated tissues are not reduced when complete block of sympathetic nerve stimulation has been produced by <b>guanethidine.</b> It is suggested that <b>guanethidine</b> possesses a primary bretylium-like, and a secondary reserpine-like, blocking action. <b>Guanethidine</b> produces a transient lowering of intestinal 5 -hydroxytryptamine, and this coincides with increased intestinal motility...|$|E

40|$|Supersensitivity to {{noradrenaline}} {{contributes to}} certain vascular disorders (e. g., hypertension) and chronic neuropathic pain conditions (e. g., complex regional pain syndrome). We {{aimed to develop}} a procedure for inducing adrenergic supersensitivity {{that could be used}} to investigate the role of catecholamines in these clinical conditions. In the first study, three doses of <b>guanethidine</b> were administered by iontophoresis to separate small patches of skin in the forearm of healthy human volunteers. Four to five hours later, the vasoconstrictor response to the adrenergic releasing agent tyramine was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by iontophoretic pretreatment with <b>guanethidine,</b> indicating that <b>guanethidine</b> had depleted endogenous adrenergic stores. In a second study, <b>guanethidine</b> and saline were administered by iontophoresis four times over approximately 2 weeks at separate sites in the forearm. One to two days after the final pretreatment, vasoconstriction to the iontophoresis of a weak dose of noradrenaline was enhanced at sites pretreated with <b>guanethidine.</b> To investigate the effect of <b>guanethidine</b> pretreatment on thermal hyperalgesia, the experimental sites were sensitized to heat by the topical application of 0. 6 % capsaicin. Both before and after the application of capsaicin, the heat-pain threshold and heat-pain ratings to suprathreshold stimulation were similar at sites pretreated for 2 weeks with <b>guanethidine</b> or saline. However, after the iontophoresis of noradrenaline, thermal hyperalgesia was greater at the guanethidine-pretreated site than the saline pretreated site. These observations indicate that prolonged depletion of adrenergic stores by <b>guanethidine</b> induces adrenergic supersensitivity in cutaneous vessels, and that adrenergic supersensitivity enhances thermal hyperalgesia in the presence of noradrenaline...|$|E
40|$|<b>Guanethidine</b> is {{commonly}} used as a drug to investigate adrenergic neurotransmission and, in combination with atropine, to realize non-adrenergic non-cholinergic (NANC) conditions. Previous studies suggested a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor blocking effect of <b>guanethidine.</b> Therefore, we investigated the effect of increasing concentrations of <b>guanethidine</b> (0. 1 – 100 [*]μM) on nicotine-induced relaxations of longitudinal muscle strips of rat gastric fundus. In the presence of 1 [*]μM atropine and 3 [*]μM <b>guanethidine,</b> nicotine (30 [*]μM) induces a fast and sustained relaxation which is partly inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitors Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NOARG) and Nω-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) (both 30 and 100 [*]μM). One μM tetrodotoxin (TTX) completely blocks this nicotine-induced relaxation. High concentrations of <b>guanethidine</b> (⩾ 10 [*]μM), but not adrenoceptor blockade by the α-adrenoceptor antagonist phentolamine {{in combination with the}} β-adrenoceptor antagonist nadolol (both 3 [*]μM), inhibit the nicotine-induced relaxation. <b>Guanethidine</b> (0. 1 – 100 [*]μM) has no effect on relaxations induced by electrical field stimulation (EFS; 1 – 8 [*]Hz), nitric oxide (NO; 0. 01 – 1 [*]μM), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP; 0. 1 – 10 [*]nM) or isoprenaline (1 – 10 [*]nM).
