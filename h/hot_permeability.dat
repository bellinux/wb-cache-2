40|$|In the {{evaporative}} pattern casting process, casting defects occur {{depending on the}} properties of the foam pattern itself and the coating material. In particular, the permeability of the coat strongly affects product quality. However, there are some difficulties in improving casting defects caused by the permeability because there exists no appropriate evaluating method for <b>hot</b> <b>permeability.</b> We propose a new convenient method for the high precision measurement of coating permeability from room temperature to elevated temperature (<b>hot</b> <b>permeability)</b> using a suction type permeability tester. Remarkable difference in the <b>hot</b> <b>permeability</b> of the coat is found even if the room temperature permeability of coat is the same. Additionally the nature of <b>hot</b> <b>permeability</b> of the coat is classified into three types, they are decrement in permeability, constant, and increase from room temperature. Evaluation of castings based on the <b>hot</b> <b>permeability</b> data obtained by this method in the actual production site reveals a slight influence on the pouring rate. Measurement of the <b>hot</b> <b>permeability</b> of coating should therefore be useful for preventing casting defects...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} pragmatic means to {{evaluate}} the degree of permeability of different ceramic shell moulds using a low cost practical method as compared to a more sophisticated <b>hot</b> <b>permeability</b> method. The proposed method makes use of a blind riser as a "barometer" strategically attached to a mould to measure the different heights attained by molten bronze when poured into the mould in question. By arithmetic calculation {{the height of the}} bronze column in the blind riser gives an indication of the permeability of the ceramic shell mould under investigation. The permeability values thus obtained could be useful as an indicator to determine the number of risers that will provide sufficient air-vents for the moulds during a bronze pour.

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} model with porosity and permeability formulations in the transport equations has been developed to study the concept of nuclear thermal propulsion through the analysis of a pulsed irradiation of a particle bed element (PIPE). The numerical model is a time-accurate pressure-based formulation. An adaptive upwind scheme is employed for spatial discretization. The upwind scheme is based on second- and fourth-order central differencing with adaptive artificial dissipation. Multiblocked porosity regions have been formulated to model the cold frit, particle bed, and <b>hot</b> frit. Multiblocked <b>permeability</b> regions have been formulated to describe the flow shaping effect from the thickness-varying cold frit. Computational results for several zero-power density PIPEs and an elevated-particle-temperature PIPE are presented. The implications of the computational results are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Hypersonic {{airliner}} {{would be}} exposed to temperatures that are {{beyond the limits of}} classical aircraft materials. In order to handle this problem the latest developments of new materials and composite structures suitable for high temperature application need to be taken into account. The focus of the European Research program ATLLAS is on advanced light-weight, high-temperature material development strongly linked to a high-speed passenger aircraft design. ATLLAS stands for Aerodynamic and Thermal Load Interactions with Lightweight Advanced Materials for High Speed Flight. The 4 years program ATLLAS-II is a logical continuation project built upon the experience and technology development gained within ATLLAS-I. The corresponding work related to combustor structures and material integration deals with the opportunity to investigate at academic level, both in basic and relevant environment, different solutions possibly usable to ensure the long range cruise of a high speed airliner. Different materials (UTHC, CMC, metallic) and different cooling techniques (radiation, convective, transpiration) are studied. Available numerical or semi-empirical tools are used to prepare the test, to design the different architectures. A pin fin experiment allows to better know the pressure drop and the heat transfer for different channel patterns with thermal cristal techniques. The ERBURIG-K long duration test facility allow to characterize different ceramic matrix composite uncooled samples and will allow to realize, at small scale, a long duration (several hours) investigation of cooled ceramic structure in PTAH-SOCAR technology. A multifonctionnal metallic transpiration cooled HSS panel using Hollow Spheres Stacking as core material was designed and preliminary tested in cold conditions with GN 2 and in hot conditions with infra lamps under 1 MW/mÂ² heat flux. CMC and UHTC materials are used to design, manufacture and test generic fin injectors usable in high speed combustors. Industrial hypersonic METHYLE test facility is used to test in relevant Mach 6 combustor environment HSS panel as well as advanced fin injectors. <b>Hot</b> and cold <b>permeability</b> of composites is documented with GN 2 and GH 2. Numerical models are used in accordance with the experiments, some examples are given in the present paper...|$|R
