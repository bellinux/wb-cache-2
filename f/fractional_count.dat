40|$|Image {{contrast}} enhancement {{based on the}} generalized histogram Abstract. We present an adaptive {{contrast enhancement}} method based on the generalized histogram, which is obtained by relaxing the restriction of using the integer count. For each pixel, the integer count 1 allocated to a pixel is split into the <b>fractional</b> <b>count</b> and the remainder count. The generalized histogram is generated by accumulating the <b>fractional</b> <b>count</b> for each intensity level and distributing the remainder count uniformly throughout the intensity levels. The intensity mapping function, which determines the contrast gain for each intensity level, {{is derived from the}} generalized histogram. Since only the fractional part of the count allocated to each pixel is used for increasing the contrast gain of its intensity level, the amount of contrast enhancement is adjusted by varying the <b>fractional</b> <b>count</b> according to regional characteristics. The proposed scheme produces visually more pleasing results than the conventional histogram equalization. © 2007 SPIE and IS&T. �DOI: 10. 1117 / 1. 2775482 �...|$|E

We discuss the connection between field normalization and the choice of a counting method for handling publications with multiple co-authors.

However, {{there have been}} limited data to assess the trends in national-level cardiovascular research output, even as cardiovascular disease [CVD] has become {{the leading cause of}} morbidity and mortality worldwide. We performed a time trends analysis of cardiovascular research publications (1999 - 2008) downloaded from Web of Knowledge using a iteratively-tested cardiovascular bibliometric filter with > 90 % precision and recall. We evaluated cardiovascular research publications, five-year running actual citation indices [ACIs], and degree of international collaboration measured through the ratio of the <b>fractional</b> <b>count</b> of addresses from one country against all addresses for each publication. Global cardiovascular publication volume increased from 40 661 publications in 1999 to 55 284 publications in 2008, which represents a 36 % increase. The proportion of cardiovascular publications from high-income, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development [OECD] countries declined from 93 % to 84 % of the total share over the study period. High-income, OECD countries generally had higher fractional counts, which suggest less international collaboration, than lower income countries from 1999 - 2008. There was an inverse relationship between cardiovascular publications and age-standardized CVD morbidity and mortality rates, but a direct, curvilinear relationship between cardiovascular publications and Human Development Index from 1999 - 2008. Cardiovascular health research output has increased substantially in the past decade, with a greater share of citations being published from low- and middle-income countries.

40|$|The {{particles}} accelerated in CERN accelerator chain reach high energies, {{topped by}} the particle energy at collision in the LHC, 7 GeV. During the operation, {{an amount of}} particles is inevitably lost from the beam. Depending {{on the extent of}} the losses, physical damage to machine components may be caused and the shower of secondary emission particles deposits energy in the surrounding equipment constituting the accelerator. The hadronic cascade also activates their materials, representing a hazard to the workers at CERN. In the LHC, the superconducting magnets that constitute the synchrotron lattice are kept at an operating temperature of 1 : 9 K through a cryogenic facility employing superliquid helium, the increase in their temperature potentially initiates a quench. In the SPS, the damage due to a lost beam is also visible. The Beam Loss Monitoring (BLM) system has been developed to reliably protect the machines composing CERN’s accelerator chain and additionally provide information about the beam status: the system provides observations about local aperture restrictions, orbit distortion, beam oscillations and particle diffusion, allowing the operators to tune the machines, measure and maximize the efficiency of the chain. To achieve this, two types of particles detectors are distributed along the machines in the positions where the most intense losses are expected, typically where aperture limitations are present – for exa mple where the collimators are located. The main type of detector in use is the ionization chamber, albeit where a very high dose rate is expected Secondary Emission Monitor (SEM) are employed instead. Both types of detectors are sensitive to the hardronic showers initiated by high energy particles and they are characterized by high linearity and accuracy with respect to the energy lost by the particles, a fast responses and good radiation tolerance. Where timely machine protection is in place, for every detector location the fraction of particles from the hardronic showers has been linked to the energy distribution within the coil through simulation-based analysis and maximum allowable energy value has been established. The signal from the detector is acquired by the front-end electronics and, where applicable, the measurement is compared with the threshold relevant for the considered ring location. As the dimensions of the accelerators varies greatly, the signal might be acquired, digitized in the accelerator tunnel and then sent to the surface electronics to be processed – as it happens in the LHC – or the complete processing may occur in a shielded facility closely located. In the former case, radiation tolerant electronics is required. In the LHC, when a threshold is exceeded, the beam permit signal is revoked and the circulating particles are directed towards the dump line. In machines employing warm magnets – such as the PS Booster – the beam parameters are tuned before the next injection, to increase the quality of the beam. A discrete components design of a current digitizer based on the current-to-frequency converter (CFC) principle has been studied in this work. The design targets at rather high input current compared to similar acquisition systems, with a maximum equal to 100 mA and a minimum of 1 nA, as required by the ionization chamber that will be employed in the Proton Synchrotron and Booster accelerators {{as well as in the}} LINAC 4.
