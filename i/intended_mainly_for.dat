25|$|When Hus, as {{a result}} of an interdict, left Prague for the country, he {{realized}} what a gulf there was between university education and theological speculation on one hand, and the life of uneducated country priests and the laymen entrusted to their care on the other. Therefore, he started to write many texts in Czech, such as basics of the Christian faith or preachings, <b>intended</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>for</b> the priests whose knowledge of Latin was poor.|$|E

The Master's other works are mostly religious and some are relatively large for very early engravings; these were <b>intended</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>for</b> insertion as illustrations into manuscript devotional books. As with most early printmakers, many of his designs survive only in copies by others, and many have not survived at all.|$|E

Milton is later shown working on Steve Canyon.|$|E

[...] Pocket PC 2000 was <b>intended</b> <b>mainly</b> <b>for</b> Pocket PC devices; however, several Palm-Size PC devices had the ability to be updated also. [...] While, several Pocket PC 2000 phones were released, Microsoft's smartphone hardware platform was not yet created. [...] The only resolution supported by this release was 240 x 320 (QVGA). [...] Removable storage card formats that were supported were CompactFlash and MultiMediaCard. [...] At this time Pocket PC devices had not been standardized with a specific CPU architecture. [...] As a result, Pocket PC 2000 was released on multiple CPU architectures; SH-3, MIPS, and ARM. Infrared (IR) File beaming capability was among the original hardware features.|$|E

An accidental circuit completion path through an earth-ground creates the danger of a burn at a site far away from the probe electrode, and for this reason single-electrode devices are used only on conscious patients who would be aware of such complications, and only on carefully insulated tables.|$|E
