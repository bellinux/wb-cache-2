5|$|Callie takes Sofia to {{live with}} Meredith and Derek, Zola, and Baby Bailey {{for a while before}} kicking Arizona out of their {{apartment}} and celebrates by dancing in her underwear. Callie also left Arizona at therapy, telling her that {{she was the only one}} that needed to go. After being hit by a lawsuit, her father, Carlos, visits and tells Callie that he cheated on her mother but she took him back and Callie wouldn't be <b>here</b> <b>if</b> her mother didn't give Carlos a second chance. Callie goes to Arizona's apartment and invites her to come back home. Callie finds out during surgery that Arizona was sleeping with Leah, a second year resident, while separated. Although angry at Arizona, Callie still agrees to work things out.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops <b>here.</b> <b>If</b> I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any pain I may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

25|$|A stone tablet {{was found}} {{on the south side of}} Hanover Square in Newcastle that records the work of Cohors I Thracum on the vallum, but it is thought {{unlikely}} that this unit was ever permanently stationed <b>here.</b> <b>If</b> not they could have been stationed at a possible fort on the south side of the River Tyne, if such a fort existed at this time.|$|E
25|$|Black-footed smallish marine shags of Europe and {{southern}} Africa. Wahlberg's cormorant is very tentatively placed here; it seems anatomically {{more similar to}} the P. fuscscens, but the more informative characters – the combination of frontal crest and lack of extensive naked skin at bill base in mid-sized Old World species – seem to place it <b>here.</b> <b>If</b> this is correct, they are probably very distantly related due to biogeography.|$|E

25|$|A further {{indication}} {{for the use}} of {{a printing}} technique is the varying strength of the letters, which suggests that the surface of the lamella was not completely flat during printing. Thus, the outline of the letters, as to be expected with a print, appear in the slightly more elevated regions of the sheet (darker areas in the photo), more distinct than in the slightly deeper regions (lighter areas) that were not affected by the full force of the stamp. This can be observed particularly along the folds and in the last line where the edge of the foil was apparently slightly bent downwards while being printed. Consequently, the impressions of the letters appear less marked <b>here.</b> <b>If</b> the text had been directly inscribed with a stylus into the foil, these variations would not have occurred.|$|E
25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to think that every tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way <b>here,</b> <b>if</b> only for that reason.|$|E
25|$|Korea – as {{a platoon}} leader. Recon leader. What {{is the job}} of a recon leader? To recon the front line – no man’s land. And what did we do? I had to assault a {{fortified}} position of the Chinese communists and wiped them out. And what is this Special Forces group that we commanded in the Army – '62–'65? That was the only remaining combat unit in the Philippine Army. The rest were training in a division set-up. We were in Luzon. We were in Sulu. And then, during the previous regime, Marawi incident. Who was sent there? Ramos. We defended the camp, being besieged by 400 rebels. So next time, look at the man’s record, don't just write and write. You said, no combat experience, no combat experience. Look around you who comes from the platoon, who rose to battalion staff, company commander, group commander, which is like a battalion, brigade commander, here and abroad. Abroad, I never had an abroad assignment that was not combat. NO SOFT JOBS FOR RAMOS. Thirty-seven years in the Armed Forces. REMEMBER THAT. You’re only writing about the fringe, but do not allow yourself to destroy the armed forces by those guys. You write about the majority of the Armed Forces who are on the job. That's why we're here enjoying our freedom, ladies and gentlemen. You are <b>here.</b> <b>If</b> the majority of the Armed Forces did not do their job, I doubt very much if you’d all be here.|$|E

500|$|In 1972, Lester {{returned}} to the interscholastic ranks {{as a head coach}} at Paint Branch High School in Burtonsville, Maryland, which awarded him a ten-year contract. It was Paint Branch's third year of varsity football, and their first two campaigns had ended with 3–7 records. About the move, Lester said, [...] "I spent too long treating college players nice and making sure they were happy... I don't have to do that now. I can coach <b>here.</b> <b>If</b> they want to quit, fine."In 1975, he led Paint Branch to the Class B state championship.|$|E

500|$|Just a {{day after}} {{returning}} for pre-season training with Leeds, on 28 June 2013, Morison joined former club Millwall, also of the Championship, on a season-long loan deal. On rejoining Millwall, Morison stated – [...] "I'm pleased to be back <b>here.</b> <b>If</b> anybody has any doubts about me all I'd say is that I aim to score plenty of goals for Millwall and help this club to greater success". Morison finished the season with eight goals in 41 appearances, helping the London club stave off relegation from the Championship with a 19th-place finish.|$|E

500|$|Obama's family history, upbringing, and Ivy League {{education}} differ markedly {{from those}} of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation {{in the civil rights}} movement. Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is [...] "black enough", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that [...] "we're still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong."

500|$|Several reviewers criticized Lone Survivor for {{focusing}} more on its action scenes than on characterization. In {{his review}} for The Star-Ledger, Stephen Whitty wrote, [...] "This {{is the sort}} of bare-bones story that well served plenty of World War II movies once, and it would work <b>here,</b> <b>if</b> Berg had the sense to develop these men as characters, first. But we don't really get to know any of them, or what they might bring personally to this life-or-death emergency." [...] Rafer Guzman of Newsday wrote, [...] "The movie seems more concerned with military-style action than with telling us who these fallen heroes really were." ...|$|E
500|$|Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu called Aagadu a [...] "simple, oft-repeated cop vs. don story", and added, [...] "The {{difference}} {{here is the}} don is reduced to a cardboard.

But try an overdose of this formula {{and it could be}} tiring." [...] Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "Though this film has many similarities of Srinu Vaitla’s earlier films, but it’s Mahesh Babu who has the audience’s attention throughout. Watch it for him and more rely on him".|$|E
500|$|In 1878 and 1879 Stanford {{worked on}} his first opera, The Veiled Prophet, to a {{libretto}} by his friend William Barclay Squire. It {{was based on a}} poem by Thomas Moore with characters including a virgin priestess and a mystic prophet, and a plot that culminates in poisoning and stabbing. Stanford offered the work to the opera impresario Carl Rosa, who refused it and suggested that the composer should try to have it staged in Germany: [...] "Its success will (unfortunately) have much greater chances <b>here</b> <b>if</b> accepted abroad." [...] Referring to the enormous popularity of Sullivan's comic operas, Rosa added, [...] "If the work was of the Pinafore style it would be quite another matter." [...] Stanford had greatly enjoyed Sullivan's Cox and Box, but The Veiled Prophet was intended to be a serious work of high drama and romance.|$|E
