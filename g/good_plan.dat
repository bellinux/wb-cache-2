25|$|On 7 July 1645, demonstrating {{against the}} points of passage between Ilchester and Langport, Fairfax {{secretly}} occupied Yeovil. The post at that place, which had been the right of Goring's first position, had perhaps rightly been withdrawn to Ilchester, when the second position was taken up. Fairfax repaired the bridge without interruption. Goring showed himself unequal to the new situation. He might, if sober, make a <b>good</b> <b>plan</b> when the enemy was not present to disturb him, and he certainly led cavalry charges with boldness and skill. But of strategy {{in front of the}} enemy, he was incapable. On the news from Yeovil, he abandoned the line of the Yeo, as far as Langport, without striking a blow. Fairfax, having nothing to gain by continuing his detour through Yeovil, came back and quietly crossed at Long Sutton, west of Ilchester on 9 July.|$|E
500|$|While {{this may}} have seemed like a <b>good</b> <b>plan,</b> Jourdan's choice of ground created {{problems}} for him later. The plain below Pfullendorf was riddled with such streams and brooks as the Ostrach, a Danube tributary, which drained out of the marshes and swamps of Pfrungenried; {{in the spring of}} most years, this was not the best choice of ground. Although from Pfullendorf and the more moderate heights {{to the north of the}} village of Ostrach, Jourdan could establish reasonable artillery positions, the softness of the marshland itself would diminish the impact of a cannonade on the Austrian line. The marsh was also prone to fogginess, which would hinder visual planning and tactics. Furthermore, the softness of the ground would make the use of cavalry difficult, and cavalry maneuvers would be made more difficult by the likelihood of fog. Finally, the major part of Charles' army had wintered immediately east of the Lech, which Jourdan knew, because he had sent agents into Germany with instructions to identify the location and strength of his enemy. [...] This was less than [...] distant; any passage over the Lech was facilitated by available bridges, both of permanent construction and temporary pontoons and a traverse through friendly territory.|$|E

2500|$|On December 4, 2007, {{school administrators}} were {{informed}} that an NWSS student {{had been diagnosed with}} infectious tuberculosis (TB). While the identity of the 9th grade student could not be released, over 200 peers and teachers who came into contact with the individual were notified, and voluntary testing was carried out in room 149 starting on December 11. Responding to the incident, superintendent John Woudzia stated: [...] "It's a significant issue, (but) I'm convinced we have a <b>good</b> <b>plan</b> in place." [...] Most forms of TB are currently treatable with antibiotics, but drug-resistant strains are becoming more common. As a follow-up procedure, the school tested these students and teachers once again on February 13, 2008.|$|E
2500|$|When Stopford {{was first}} shown the plan on 22 July he declared, [...] "It is a <b>good</b> <b>plan.</b> [...] I am {{sure it will}} succeed and I congratulate whoever has been {{responsible}} for framing it." [...] Stopford's chief-of-staff, Brigadier General Hamilton Reed was not so supportive and his doubts and prejudices succeeded in swaying Stopford. [...] Reed was an artillery officer who had won the Victoria Cross during the Boer War. [...] Having served on the Western Front, he believed no assault on entrenched positions could be made without artillery support. [...] Reconnaissance had revealed no prepared fortifications at Suvla and yet Stopford proceeded to limit the objectives of the landing and Hamilton failed to stop him. [...] The final orders issued by Stopford and the 11th Division commander, Major General Frederick Hammersley, were imprecise, requiring only that the high ground be taken [...] "if possible".|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} case, on 10 August 1938 von Wietersheim {{had been called}} to the Berghof, Hitler's Bavarian retreat, along {{with a group of}} other {{high-ranking}} Wehrmacht chiefs of staff in order that Hitler could attempt to persuade them that invading Czechoslovakia was a <b>good</b> <b>plan</b> of action. Most of the generals were not convinced by Hitler's arguments, but Generals Jodl and Manstein later commented that von Wietersheim, who was the highest-ranking officer in attendance (and the Chief of Staff of General Wilhelm Adam's Second Army Group, which was in charge of any potential Western Front), was the only one present to argue with Hitler directly about the faults in his plan, namely that an invasion of Czechoslovakia would leave the West Wall along the German-French border weak and in risk of being overrun within a few weeks should a French force decide to attack. Jodl reported in his diary that Hitler [...] "became furious" [...] and yelled at von Wietersheim: [...] "I say to you Herr General... will be held not only for three weeks but for three years!" [...] Although, from a certain point of view, this comment proved to be correct, it ultimately exhibited to more cautious, experienced German commanders like von Wietersheim that Hitler's military philosophy was not only misguided, but potentially ruinous if he were allowed to continue driving military policy.|$|E

40|$|Planning {{stands at}} a crossroads. Much of the idealism and {{momentum}} for {{the pursuit of the}} public good has been lost in the painful evaluation of its failure to produce a better environment and to advance the good society. In this note it is argued that much can still be done to make planning more effective though the development of better methods in terms of structuring goals, outlining resources and constraints which bound possible plans, finding possible actions which generate <b>good</b> <b>plans,</b> predicting their outcomes, and finding <b>good</b> <b>plans</b> within all these limits including those of time and political tolerance. ...|$|R

2500|$|Baldrick is a {{septic tank}} cleaner to the 20th century Lord Blackadder in [...] His first {{appearance}} is serving Blackadder's millennium dinner, {{which he does}} wearing nothing but an amusing apron, on a whim. His cooking is similar to Private Baldrick's; he prepared dinner by coughing over an avocado. His underpants may date from the 18th century, or in any case smell as though they do, and {{turn out to be}} the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs. Rather surprisingly he builds a working time machine, making him [...] "the greatest genius who ever lived". Or it would do, if he knew how it worked and had not just built it using a combination of the plans of Leonardo da Vinci and an apparent skill at building Airfix models being able to make up for his inability to read the plans. Following his master's rewriting of history, he becomes Prime Minister of the United Kingdom – and possibly dictator, as the television commentator observes that elections have been abolished (although how much power he has with Edmund as king is questionable). His intelligence appears to be between that of the medieval Baldrick and the Elizabethan Baldrick. His [...] "cunning plan" [...] was possibly the only plan which a Blackadder ever thought was a <b>good</b> <b>plan,</b> albeit with a slight modification to it.|$|E
2500|$|Wavell had {{not wanted}} the Syrian {{distraction}} when British forces in the Mediterranean were overstretched and the promenade guaranteed by the Free French {{appeared to be a}} false promise. Churchill and the CIGS forced the campaign on Wavell and when Vichy forces defended Syria, the British forces needed reinforcement, which could only be provided piecemeal. Many of the British and Commonwealth troops were novices and the hot, dry and mountainous terrain was a severe test, in which Indian Army units excelled. The Australian contingent had to cope with the worst country but conducted the most effective attack, [...] "with a <b>good</b> <b>plan</b> carried through with great determination". The achievement of air superiority was delayed by the lack of aircraft but the urgency of the situation made it impossible for the naval and ground forces to wait. Vichy French airmen concentrated their attacks on ships and ground targets, which were highly effective until they were forced to move north. The scare caused by the German success in Crete had been exaggerated because the German parachute and glider invasion of Crete had been costly and there was little chance of the Germans gaining a bridgehead in Syria. The Germans withdrew from Syria to preserve their forces and to deprive the British of a pretext for invasion. The British invaded Syria anyway and took over naval and air bases far north of Suez and increased the safety of the oil route from Basra to Baghdad in Iraq to Haifa in Palestine.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} few weeks at Carlisle, when the Lakota and Dakota greatly outnumbered all other tribes, it was {{discovered}} that Cheyennes and Kiowas were learning to speak Lakota and Dakota. After that, English was the only language permitted on the campus. Dormitory rooms held three or four each, and no two students from the same tribe were permitted to room together. The plan helped in the rapid acquirement of English, and although some were hereditary foes, Pratt believed the Indian students to be less inclined to quarrel than most white children. However, there were consequences. In 1879, Chief Blue Horse's son Baldwin Blue Horse, age 12, was in the first group of Oglala Lakota students to arrive at Carlisle. In 1888, Chief Blue Horse met with Baldwin at a performance of Buffalo Bill's Wild West in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and spoke through an interpreter. Later Luther Standing Bear was called to the superintendent's office and asked him if {{it was a good idea}} to get some Indian boys from the reservation and put them in school with white boys, expecting that the Indian boys would learn faster by such an association. Luther agreed that it might be a <b>good</b> <b>plan,</b> so a permit was received from Washington. Sixty boys from Pine Ridge were mixed with 60 European-American boys. Teachers had hoped the Indians would learn the English language faster by this arrangement. [...] "But lo and behold, the white boys began learning the Sioux language." [...] The program was discontinued. Some Native Americans are angry about painful Indian boarding school experiences and Pratt's Progressive Reformist views on assimilation have been condemned.|$|E
