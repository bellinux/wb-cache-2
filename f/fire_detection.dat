40|$|We {{present a}} new {{technique}} for generating daily global estimates of biomass burning emissions suitable for use in models forecasting atmospheric chemical composition and air quality. We combine ecosystem-dependent carbon fuel databases, fire weather severity estimates, and near-real-time satellite <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> from the MODIS instruments to estimate {{the amount of carbon}} released from active fires. Emissions of CO, NOx, and hydrocarbons are then estimated using ecosystem-dependent emission ratios. These emissions estimates have been used to provide global chemical and regional aerosol forecasts for much of 2006 using the NASA/University of Wisconsin Realtime Air Quality Modeling System (RAQMS). The largest overall uncertainty in this approach lies in inferring area burned from instantaneous active <b>fire</b> <b>detections.</b> Here we evaluate emissions for spring and summer of 2006 by intercomparing our emissions estimates with three other approaches using satellite <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> over regional to global domains: 1) NOAA GOES <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> over the continental US, 2) MODIS fire and landcover products over North and Central America, and 3) 8 -day composite MODIS detections applied to global GFEDv 2 emissions. Overall we find there are large differences in area-burned estimates, particularly for small fires. We compare RAQMS global CO predictions with observations from the MOPITT and TES instruments over regions where biomass burning is significant.

The total number of active <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> and burned area was highest in areas that had intermediate levels of both net primary production (NPP; 500 – 1000 g C m− 2 year− 1) and precipitation (1000 – 2000 mm year− 1), with limits imposed by the length of the fire season in wetter ecosystems and by fuel availability in drier ecosystems. For wet tropical forest ecosystems we developed a metric called the fire-driven deforestation potential (FDP) that integrated information about the length and intensity of the dry season.

This climate-fire link in combination with higher precipitation rates in the interior of the Amazon suggests that a negative feedback on fire-driven deforestation may exist as the deforestation front moves inward.

40|$|Fire-driven {{deforestation}} is {{the major}} source of carbon emissions from Amazonia. Recent expansion of mechanized agriculture in forested regions of Amazonia has increased the average size of deforested areas, but related changes in fire dynamics remain poorly characterized. We estimated the contribution of fires from the deforestation process to total fire activity based on the local frequency of active <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors. High-confidence <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> at the same ground location on 2 or more days per year are most common in areas of active deforestation, where trunks, branches, and stumps can be piled and burned many times before woody fuels are depleted. Across Amazonia, high-frequency fires typical of deforestation accounted for more than 40 % of the MODIS <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> during 2003 - 2007. Active deforestation frontiers in Bolivia and the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso, Pará, and Rondônia contributed 84 % of these high-frequency fires during this period. Among deforested areas, the frequency and timing of fire activity vary according to postclearing land use. Fire usage for expansion of mechanized crop production in Mato Grosso is more intense and more evenly distributed throughout the dry season than forest clearing for cattle ranching (4. 6 vs. 1. 7 fire days per deforested area, respectively), even for clearings > 200 ha in size. Fires for deforestation may continue for several years, increasing the combustion completeness of cropland deforestation to nearly 100 % and pasture deforestation to 50 - 90 % over 1 - 3 -year timescales typical of forest conversion. Our results demonstrate that there is no uniform relation between satellite-based <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> and carbon emissions. Improved understanding of deforestation carbon losses in Amazonia will require models that capture interannual variation in the deforested area that contributes to fire activity and variable combustion completeness of individual clearings as a function of fire frequency or other evidence of postclearing land use. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing...|$|R
40|$|Forest {{conservation}} and REDD+ projects invest {{millions of dollars}} each year to reduce local communities' dependence on forests and prevent forest loss and degradation.

We found a statistically significant correlation between presence of any investment and reduced deforestation rates in 2010 and 2011 -years with accelerated deforestation elsewhere in the study area.

25|$|On Tuesday, February 7, 2006, a UPS Douglas DC-8 {{cargo plane}} {{suffered}} an in-flight cargo fire {{and made an}} emergency landing at Philadelphia International Airport after filling with smoke. There were no injuries other than smoke inhalation affecting the crew, but the plane burned {{on the ground for}} hours into the night, though most of the cargo survived, the aircraft was a total loss, with multiple holes burned through the roof skin. According to the NTSB, the firefighting crew did not have adequate training on using their skin-piercing extinguishing equipment and not knowing how to open the main cargo door, attempted to force the handle and broke the latch, rendering the door unopenable. There were also difficulties in obtaining the cargo manifest to determine what if any hazardous materials were on board, due to confusion about protocol. However, despite these failings, the airport staff, including the firefighting staff, managed the incident successfully without injury or major disruption of the airport. The NTSB suspected lithium ion batteries were the source of ignition and made recommendations for more stringent rules and restrictions on their air transport, especially on passenger aircraft (unlike this one). For a cause of the incident, the NTSB focused on the delayed indication of fire by the required onboard <b>fire</b> <b>detection</b> system and criticized the standards to which such systems are tested, noting that the tests use an empty cargo hold and do not represent the real-world performance of the detection systems with the hold full of cargo, which significantly changes the flow patterns of hot air and smoke.

40|$|Earth {{observation}} sensors play {{an important}} role in quantifying the energy released by fires and capturing their spatial and temporal dynamics. Using estimates of MODIS-derived fire radiative power (FRP) we characterised bushfire activity and intensity in tropical savannas of northern Australia, by season and vegetation type, over the period 2004 – 2012. Our results indicate that fire activity was highest in the Northern Territory and lowest in Queensland. Mean daily number of <b>fire</b> <b>detections</b> was almost twice as high in the late dry season (August–November) compared to the early dry season (May–July). Fire season was bimodal with fire activity peaks in May and October. Median fire intensity was lower for early dry season fires (29 MW) than late dry season fires (56 MW), and was positively correlated with the number of <b>fire</b> <b>detections.</b> Vegetation types with sparse canopy structure showed lower fire activity and higher intensity. Remote sensing of FRP provides frequent estimates of fire intensity over broad areas, allowing the comparison of this key fire behaviour metric across ecosystems and throughout the fire season. FRP estimates may also be used to draw inferences regarding fire effects, once the complexity and ecosystem-specificity of the relationships between fire intensity and fire severity is acknowledged...|$|R
