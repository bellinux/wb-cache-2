40|$|We {{provide a}} number of new {{construction}} techniques for cubical complexes and cubical polytopes, and thus for cubifications (hexahedral mesh generation). As an application we obtain an instance of a cubical 4 -polytope that has a non-orientable <b>dual</b> <b>manifold</b> (a Klein bottle). This confirms an existence conjecture of Hetyei (1995). More systematically, we prove that every normal crossing codimension one immersion of a compact 2 -manifold into R^ 3 PL-equivalent to a <b>dual</b> <b>manifold</b> immersion of a cubical 4 -polytope. As an instance we obtain a cubical 4 -polytope with a cubation of Boy's surface as a <b>dual</b> <b>manifold</b> immersion, and with an odd number of facets. Our explicit example has 17 718 vertices and 16 533 facets. Thus we get a parity changing operation for 3 -dimensional cubical complexes (hexa meshes); this solves problems of Eppstein, Thurston, and others.

40|$|In this paper, the duality in {{differential}} form {{is developed}} between a 3 D primal surface and its <b>dual</b> <b>manifold</b> {{formed by the}} surface’s tangent planes, i. e., each tangent plane of the primal surface is represented as a four-dimensional vector which constitutes a point on the <b>dual</b> <b>manifold.</b> The iterated dual theorem shows that each tangent plane of the <b>dual</b> <b>manifold</b> corresponds to a point on the original 3 D surface, i. e., the “dual ” of the “dual ” {{goes back to the}} “primal”.

In this paper we further develop the work in our original conference papers resulting in the robust differential dual operator. We argue that the operator makes good use of the information available in the image data, by using both points of intensity discontinuity and their edge directions; we provide a simple physical interpretation of what the abstract algorithm is actually estimating and why it makes sense in terms of estimation accuracy; our algorithm operates on all edges in the images, including silhouette edges, self occlusion edges, and texture edges, without distinguishing their types (thus resulting in improved accuracy and handling locally concave surface estimation if texture edges are present); the algorithm automatically handles various degeneracies; and the algorithm incorporates new methodologies fo...|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we {{consider}} cubical d-polytopes, convex bounded d-dimensional polyhedra all of whose facets are combinatorially isomorphic to the (d − 1) dimensional standard cube. It {{is known that}} every cubical d-polytope P determines a PL immersion of an abstract closed cubical (d− 2) -manifold into the polytope boundary ∂P ∼ = S d− 1. The immersed manifold is orientable {{if and only if}} the 2 -skeleton of the cubical d-polytope (d ≥ 3) is “edge orientable ” in the sense of Hetyei. He conjectured that there are cubical 4 -polytopes that are not edge-orientable. In the more general setting of cubical PL (d − 1) -spheres, Babson and Chan have observed that every type of normal crossing PL immersion of a closed PL (d− 2) -manifold into an (d− 1) -sphere appears among the dual manifolds of some cubical PL (d − 1) -sphere. No similar general result was available for cubical polytopes. The reason for this may be blamed to a lack of flexible construction techniques for cubical polytopes, and for more general cubical complexes (such as the “hexahedral meshes ” that are of great interest in CAD and in Numerical Analysis). In this thesis, we develop a number of new and improved construction techniques for cubical polytopes. We try to demonstrate that it always pays off to carry along convex lifting functions of high symmetry. The most complicated and subtle one of our constructions generalizes the “Hexhoop template ” which is a well-known technique in the domain of hexahedral meshes. Using the constructions developed here, we achieve the following results: • A rather simple construction yields a cubical 4 -polytope (with 72 vertices and 62 facets) for which the immersed dual 2 -manifold is not orientable: One of its components is a Klein bottle. Apparently this is the first example of a cubical polytope with a non-orientable <b>dual</b> <b>manifold.</b> Its existence confirms the conjecture of Hetyei mentioned above...|$|E
