25|$|Pachelbel's {{apparent}} {{affinity for}} variation form {{is evident from}} his organ works that explore the genre: chaconnes, chorale variations and several sets of arias with variations. The six chaconnes, together with Buxtehude's ostinato organ works, represent a shift from the older chaconne style: they completely abandon the dance idiom, introduce contrapuntal density, employ miscellaneous chorale improvisation techniques, and, most importantly, give the bass line much thematic significance {{for the development of}} the piece. Pachelbel's chaconnes are distinctly south German in style; the duple meter C major chaconne (possibly an early work) is reminiscent of Kerll's D minor passacaglia. The remaining five works are all <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> and display a wide variety of moods and techniques, concentrating on melodic content (as opposed to the emphasis on harmonic complexity and virtuosity in Buxtehude's chaconnes). The ostinato bass is not necessarily repeated unaltered throughout the piece and is sometimes subjected to minor alterations and ornamentation. The D major, D minor and F minor chaconnes are among Pachelbel's most well-known organ pieces, and the latter is often cited as his best organ work.|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} {{is comparable to}} the opening of Tönet, ihr Pauken! Erschallet, Trompeten! BWV 214 (Resound, ye drums! Ring out, ye trumpets!) composed in 1733 on another text calling instruments to sound, which Bach later used with a different text to open his Christmas Oratorio. Bach used a festive scoring with three trumpets <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> in his 1733 [...] for the court in Dresden, in the Gloria, in [...] contrast to the preceding Kyrie.|$|E
500|$|... (And is risen) is {{expressed}} by a five-part choral movement with trumpets. The concerto on ascending motifs renders the resurrection, the ascension {{and the second}} coming, all separated by long instrumental interludes and followed by a postlude. [...] "" [...] (and will come again) {{is given to the}} bass only, for Bach the vox Christi (voice of Christ). Wenk likens the movement to a Réjouissance dance, a [...] "light festive movement <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> upbeat three eighth notes".|$|E
50|$|The song makes {{extensive}} use of hemiola, a musical technique in which the emphasis <b>in</b> a <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> is changed to give the illusion that both a duple and a <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> occur <b>in</b> the song.|$|R
50|$|The loure is a {{dance of}} slow or {{moderate}} tempo, sometimes <b>in</b> simple <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> more often <b>in</b> compound duple meter. The weight {{is on the}} first beat, which is further emphasised by the preceding anacrusis that begins the traditional loure. One of its features is a lilting dotted rhythm.|$|R
50|$|Caprice number 16 {{is one of}} Niccolò Paganini's famous 24 Caprices. As a caprice, the 16th caprice in G minor, {{although}} notated <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> time <b>meter,</b> {{consists of}} a continuous legato of 16th notes until its conclusion. The caprice contains syncopated accentuated fortissimo. The caprice lasts approximately 1 and a half minutes.|$|R
500|$|Hendrix {{described}} [...] "Manic Depression" [...] as [...] "ugly times music"; {{during a}} live performance {{he explained the}} meaning of the lyrics: [...] "It's a story about a cat wishing he could make love to music instead of the same old everyday woman." [...] The song is unusual in that its written <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> or 3/4 time, which is the time signature commonly associated with a waltz, whereas most rock music is written in 4/4. Although his delivery is rock oriented, Mitchell's drumming on the track is reminiscent of Elvin Jones's fluid jazz patterns. Musicologist Andy Aledort noted Hendrix's [...] "dramatic use of chromaticism" [...] during the song's opening bars and the [...] "heavily vibratoed unison bends" [...] that presage what he described as one of Hendrix's best guitar solos.|$|E
500|$|The Oceanides is a single-movement tone {{poem that}} {{consists}} of two main subjects, A and B. The [...] "lively" [...] A section (in duple meter), first introduced by the flutes {{at the beginning of}} the piece, can be said to represent the playful activity of the nymphs. Shortly after, solo oboe and clarinet—supported by harp glissandi and strings—introduce the [...] "majestic" [...] B section (<b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter),</b> which brings to mind the ocean's depth and expansiveness and perhaps, at least according to Tawaststjerna, [...] "the God of the Sea himself". Sibelius gradually expands and deepens the two subjects, building up to an enormous (almost onomatopoeic) wave-crash climax that Daniel Grimley has characterized as a [...] "point of textural, dynamic and chromatic saturation". Formally stated by Tawaststjerna, the tone poem structurally proceeds as follows: ...|$|E
500|$|... "n intercessory prayer," [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] is both [...] "a powerfully quiet song" [...] and a [...] "heart-rending aria" [...] {{performed}} with [...] "agony and beauty." [...] Musically, the [...] "heart-wrenching ballad" [...] "has a Broadway and choral feel to it," [...] {{distinct from the}} majority of The Hunchback of Notre Dames songs due in large to its [...] "tenderness." [...] A [...] "haunting prayer" [...] and a [...] "simple hymn," [...] "God Help the Outcasts" [...] is [...] "the most spiritual and transendent [...] tune to emerge from an animated feature." [...] The ballad, [...] "plain in structure," [...] is a [...] "hopeful and sweet anthem" [...] and [...] "lilting plea" [...] accompanied by [...] "syrupy production." [...] According to The Musical Theater of Stephen Schwartz: From Godspell to Wicked and Beyond, [...] "Menken's melody is mostly a descending, stepwise line <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> with constantly moving eighth notes accompanying," [...] while [...] "Schwartz wrote four dignified, rhymed couplets for the main tune." ...|$|E
2500|$|... (Let us rejoice most heartily) is a hymn tune that {{originated}} from Germany in 1623, and which found widespread popularity after The English Hymnal published a 1906 version <b>in</b> strong <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> with new lyrics. The triumphant melody and repeated [...] "Alleluia" [...] phrases {{have supported the}} tune's widespread usage during the Easter season and other festive occasions, especially with the English texts [...] "Ye Watchers and Ye Holy Ones" [...] and [...] "All Creatures of Our God and King".|$|R
5000|$|<b>In</b> a <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> the tourdion's {{relation}} to the galliard was [...] "more rapid and smooth than the other". Pierre Attaingnant published several tourdions in his first publication of collected dances in 1530, which contains, as the sixth and seventh items, a basse dance entitled [...] "La Magdalena" [...] with a following tourdion. Later, [...] "La Magdalena" [...] was arranged as a four-voice chanson, [...] "Quand je bois du vin clairet", by an anonymous. Thoinot Arbeau later documented information about the tourdion in his work Orchésographie (Orchesography), published in 1589.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{movement}} {{begins with}} a large, soaring theme, featuring a propulsive rhythm <b>in</b> fast <b>triple</b> <b>meter.</b> The minor mode, forceful rhythms, and cumulative contrapuntal density in both the exposition and recapitulation lend this movement a vehemently passionate character. The second movement, Adagio pastorale, similarly is dominated by serious but not solemn broad melodies. The finale, as in Piston's other symphonies, is sunny and brilliant, including a passage of syncopated wind melodies accompanied by pianissimo percussion, and pizzicato strings, which recalls the scherzo of Piston's Sixth Symphony [...]|$|R
50|$|Ordinarily a dance <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> Webern's Passacaglia {{is neither}} a dance nor <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter.</b> Structurally, {{it is based on}} an eight-note tone row forming a bass line, with twenty-three {{variations}} grouped into three paragraphs.|$|E

500|$|While Bach {{served as}} Thomaskantor– {{director}} of church music– in Leipzig from 1723, he performed the cantata several times, sometimes {{in a different}} key and with changes in the scoring. Musicologists agree that he loved the cantata's Gospel text, [...] "If ye love me...", and the Pentecost hymn used in the duet, setting both the text and the hymn several times. John Eliot Gardiner writes that Bach [...] "particularly valued" [...] this cantata. It contains features that he used again in later compositions of cantatas, oratorios and his masses, for example movements with three trumpets and timpani <b>in</b> a <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> for festive occasions, and duets {{as a symbol of}} God and man.|$|R
50|$|Tiap forau offer a performative contrast: sua and tiap hi {{have a more}} {{restrained}} character; but lively yelping and clowning punctuate tiap forau. Spectators may spontaneously get up {{and join}} in the performance. During the dance, the back row splits: the men come down {{one side of the}} group, the women down the other, until they join in front, replacing the first row. The process continues until each row has had its turn in front. Songs usually acknowledge distinguished personages, especially the chiefs acting as hosts; the texts praise people whose labors have contributed to the event (Hereniko 1991:130-131). Many tiap forau are in duple meter, but some are <b>in</b> compound <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> (transcribable as 6/8 time).|$|R

50|$|His {{harpsichord}} dances are {{of three}} types: dances <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> dances <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> paired with saltarellos, and pieces which use a ground bass. Most {{of the works}} with ground bass use some type of romanesca pattern, consisting of a line descending by fourth, rising by step, then descending again by fourth or fifth, rising by step, and so forth (the Pachelbel Canon, probably written several decades after Picchi's death, {{is probably the most}} famous example of variations over a romanesca bass).|$|E
5000|$|The mazurka (in Polish mazurek, plural mazurki) is a Polish folk dance <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> {{usually at}} a lively tempo, and with [...] "strong accents unsystematically {{placed on the}} second or third beat".|$|E
50|$|The {{music is}} <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> and fairly slow. The dance usually {{involves}} couples walking gracefully in a quarter-note rhythm, on slightly bended knees, with relaxed turns and gently swaying. Women's Kujawiak dances are also performed.|$|E
500|$|... (Osanna in the Highest) {{is set for}} two choirs and {{a festive}} orchestra, in the same key and time as the {{previous}} movement. The movement is based, as is the opening chorus of the secular cantata , probably on the opening movement of the secular cantata Es lebe der König, der Vater im Lande, BWV Anh 11, of 1732. The movement contrasts homophonic sections with fugal development. Wenk likens the movement to the Passepied, a dance <b>in</b> [...] "fast <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> with an upbeat".|$|R
50|$|The saltarello is {{a musical}} dance form {{originally}} from Italy. The first mention {{of it is}} in Add MS 29987, a fourteenth-century manuscript probably of Tuscan origin, now in the British Library. It was played <b>in</b> a fast <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> and is named for its peculiar leaping step, after the Italian verb saltare ("to jump"). This characteristic is also {{the basis of the}} German name Hoppertanz or Hupfertanz ("hopping dance"); other names include the French pas de Brabant and the Spanish alta or alta danza.|$|R
50|$|The zarambeque is a {{dance and}} musical {{form of the}} 17th and early 18th century with roots in Spanish colonial America, where Spanish, African and mestizo {{influences}} converged. It was considered a very lively, boisterous dance. Performed by popular and academic musicians, the zarambeque is written <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> and sextuple <b>meter,</b> with parallel or serial second lines in duple or quadruple meter. Diego Fernández de Huete and Santiago de Murcia made sketches of the genre.|$|R
50|$|Secular Arapaho songs {{include a}} wide variety of round dances <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> the snake dance, the rabbit dance (a partner dance {{introduced}} after European contact) and a turtle dance, along with lullabies, children's, war, historical, and courtship songs.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{classical}} works in triple metre. Joseph Haydn's [...] "Farewell" [...] Symphony {{is an interesting}} case, as the first three movements are all <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> as is the [...] "farewell" [...] section of the final movement.|$|E
50|$|The song is a mid-tempo ballad set <b>in</b> <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> and {{primarily}} {{accompanied by}} piano, {{in which the}} narrator addresses someone else, telling of how that person keeps the narrator from making mistakes in life ("every day, you save my life").|$|E
30|$|The {{features}} {{are used to}} decide whether the song is <b>in</b> duple or <b>triple</b> <b>meter.</b> Confining the metrical decision to a binary one was introduced in [11]. For dance music, the discrimination between duple and <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> has the most practical significance. Identifying various time signatures, such as 2 / 4, 4 / 4, and 6 / 8 is a more complicated task and of less practical relevance for ballroom dance music. The rhythmic {{features are}} further used to classify songs into 9 ballroom dance style classes. These results will be used to assist the tempo detection algorithm by providing information about tempo distributions collected from the training data for the corresponding class. For evaluation 10 -fold stratified cross-validation is used. This is described in more detail in Section 3.5.|$|R
5000|$|Pirekua {{ensembles}} usually include, [...] "two {{or three}} guitars, strings and winds, {{and a small}} brass band, or are unaccompanied." [...] Performed with [...] "a gentle rhythm," [...] generally in sones (3/8 time) or abajeños (6/8 time), the genre combines African, European, and indigenous American influences. Pirekua {{is related to the}} son and the waltz, and Henrietta Yurchenco points out that both the son and pirekua are <b>in</b> a slow <b>triple</b> <b>meter,</b> performed as duets, featuring rhythmic sequence against fixed patterns in the accompaniment, and using two to three chords (I-IV-V) in major or minor with little modulation.|$|R

It was only after the [...] "bop waltz" [...] appeared in the early 1950s (e.g., Thelonious Monk’s recording of Carolina Moon in 1952 and Sonny Rollins’s Valse Hot <b>in</b> 1956) that <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> became at all common in jazz [...]|$|R

40|$|Burton, Susan L. The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effect of an audiation-based {{curriculum}} on rhythmic music aptitude and rhythm achievement of elementary school students. Specific research questions addressed in this study were (a) Is there a relationship between developmental rhythm music aptitude and rhythm achievement of first, second, and third grade students? (b) Does the relationship between rhythm music aptitude and rhythm achievement change with age? and, (c) Does age have an effect on rhythm achievement? Participants in this study (N = 183) were in grades one through three, from 10 intact homerooms. Students attended a general music class once a week for 45 minutes. The study lasted for five months. All participants engaged in 5 to 10 minutes of formal rhythm pattern instruction, which alternated between duple and <b>triple</b> <b>meter</b> patterns, each week. Improvisation activities were included in the lessons. At the end of the study, all participants took an oral improvisation test <b>in</b> duple and <b>triple</b> <b>meters.</b> Two independent judges scored each improvisation using a 5 -point continuous rating scale. All participants also took a paper and pencil meter-labeling test. Gordon’s Primary Measures of Music Audiation (PMMA) (PMMA, 1986) was administered as a posttest. The results of this study revealed that there was no relationship between rhythm music aptitude and rhythm achievement. Age had an effect on achievement for aural identification of <b>triple</b> <b>meter.</b> The inclusion of audiation-based techniques, such as rhythm pattern instruction, may improve students’ rhythmic music achievement.
