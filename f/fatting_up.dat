40|$|We {{present an}} {{extensive}} description {{and analysis of}} a microfiltration process patented in our laboratory to separate different fractions of the initial milk fat globule population according {{to the size of}} the native milk fat globules (MFG). We used nominal membrane pore sizes of 2 to 12 µm and a specially designed pilot rig. Using this process with whole milk [whose MFG have a volume mean diameter (d 43) = 4. 2 ± 0. 2 µm] and appropriate membrane pore size and hydrodynamic conditions, we collected 2 extremes of the initial milk fat globule distribution consisting of 1) a retentate containing large MFG of d 43 = 5 to 7. 5 µm (with up to 250 g/kg of <b>fat,</b> <b>up</b> to 35 % of initial milk <b>fat,</b> and <b>up</b> to 10 % of initial milk volume), and 2) a permeate containing small MFG of d 43 = 0. 9 to 3. 3 µm (with up to 16 g/kg of <b>fat,</b> <b>up</b> to 30 % of initial milk <b>fat,</b> and <b>up</b> to 83 % of initial milk volume and devoid of somatic cells). We checked that the process did not mechanically damage the MFG by measuring their {zeta}-potential. This new microfiltration process, avoiding milk aging, appears to be more efficient than gravity separation in selecting native MFG of different sizes. As we summarize from previous and new results showing that the physico-chemical and technological properties of native milk fat globules vary according to their size, the use of different fat globule fractions appears to be advantageous regarding the quality of cheeses and can lead to new dairy products with adapted properties (sensory, functional, and perhaps nutritional...|$|R

50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{problems}} with the chain model of a siphon, and understanding these differences helps to explain the actual workings of siphons. First, unlike in the chain model of the siphon, it is not actually the weight on the taller side compared to the shorter side, that matters. Rather it is the difference in height from the reservoir surfaces {{to the top of the}} siphon, that determines the balance of pressure. For example, if the tube from the upper reservoir to the top of the siphon has a much larger diameter than the taller section of tube from the lower reservoir to the top of the siphon, the shorter upper section of the siphon may have a much larger weight of liquid in it, and yet the lighter volume of liquid in the down tube can pull liquid <b>up</b> the <b>fatter</b> <b>up</b> tube, and the siphon can function normally.|$|R

Results of these experiments indicated {{a significant increase in}} liver vitamin A with increasing <b>fat</b> <b>up</b> to a moderate level (3 to 4. 5 %) and a significant increase in liver vitamin A with increasing dietary vitamin A. ^ A fourth experiment was conducted with broiler chicks to examine the effect of dietary fat on vitamin E utilization. Results indicated: a significant increase in plasma vitamin E with increasing vitamin E or <b>fat</b> <b>up</b> to moderate levels (3 to 4. 5 %); a significant decrease in plasma vitamin A with vitamin E levels; and a significant fat x vitamin E interaction. ^ A fifth experiment was conducted with turkey poults to examine the effect of dietary fat on utilization of mineral elements. Results indicated that increasing fat levels significantly depressed plasma Cu, decreased Cu excretion, improved Cu retention, increased Ca excretion, decreased P excretion and decreased Ca and Mg retention. Increasing trace mineral levels significantly increased plasma Zn and the excretion of Zn and Cu. ^ A sixth experiment was conducted to investigate possible interactions among fat-soluble vitamins. Eighty-one dietary treatments were involved in a 3 x 3 x 3 x 3 factorial arrangement. The following main effects and interactions were statistically significant: Effect of vitamin A on feed efficiency, plasma vitamin A and E; Effect of vitamin D on weight gain and mortality; Effect of vitamin E on plasma A and E; Effect of A x D interaction on weight gain and plasma E; Effect of D x K interaction on feed efficiency; Effect of A x D x E interaction on plasma vitamin E concentration. Data from this study indicated that with levels of vitamins A and E currently employed, higher levels of vitamin D and K would result in improved performance. ^ A seventh experiment was conducted to investigate the effect of supplemental B-vitamins on performance of laying hens fed a simple corn-soybean meal diet.

Fresh boneless beef was obtained and thoroughly trimmed of excess visible fats, and then minced. The minced beef was divided into portions of 4 kg, and were randomly assigned to the fats.
