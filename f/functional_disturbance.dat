5|$|Symptoms {{typically}} include {{sensory impairment}} (vision, hearing, speech), disturbed sensation {{and a lack}} of coordination. The type and degree of symptoms exhibited depend upon the individual toxin, the dose, and the method and duration of exposure. Case control studies have shown effects such as tremors, impaired cognitive skills, and sleep disturbance in workers with chronic exposure to mercury vapor even at low concentrations in the range 0.7–42 μg/m3. A study has shown that acute exposure (4 – 8 hours) to calculated elemental mercury levels of 1.1 to 44mg/m3 resulted in chest pain, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, impairment of pulmonary function, and evidence of interstitial pneumonitis. Acute exposure to mercury vapor has been shown to result in profound central nervous system effects, including psychotic reactions characterized by delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in broad-ranging <b>functional</b> <b>disturbance,</b> including erethism, irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia. With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops and may escalate to violent muscular spasms. Tremor initially involves the hands and later spreads to the eyelids, lips, and tongue. Long-term, low-level exposure has been associated with more subtle symptoms of erethism, including fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams and depression.|$|E
25|$|A neuroscientific {{explanation}} {{claims that}} intruder hallucinations arise {{due to a}} <b>functional</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the multisensory processing of body and self at the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). During sleep paralysis there is a desynchrony between motor-execution and feedback from limbs (proprioception) which results in massive deafferentation (conflicting efferent and afferent neural conduction).|$|E
500|$|The {{debate over}} whether {{concussion}} is a functional or structural phenomenon is ongoing. Structural damage {{has been found in}} the mildly traumatically injured brains of animals, {{but it is not clear}} whether these findings would apply to humans. Such changes in brain structure could be responsible for certain symptoms such as visual disturbances, but other sets of symptoms, especially those of a psychological nature, are more likely to be caused by reversible pathophysiological changes in cellular function that occur after concussion, such as alterations in neurons' biochemistry. These reversible changes could also explain why dysfunction is frequently temporary. A task force of head injury experts called the Concussion In Sport Group met in 2001 and decided that [...] "concussion may result in neuropathological changes but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a <b>functional</b> <b>disturbance</b> rather than structural injury." ...|$|E

2500|$|One theory {{states that}} the mirror neuron system is {{important}} in giving rise to the intruder hallucination and out-of-body experiences during sleep paralysis.

According to this theory, sleep paralysis leads to disinhibition of the mirror neuron system, paving the way for hallucinations of human-like shadowy beings. The deafferentation of sensory information during sleep paralysis is proposed as the mechanism for such mirror neuron disinhibition.|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{suffering}} from an extreme case of anxiety may seek treatment when all support {{systems have been}} exhausted and {{they are unable to}} bear the anxiety.

50|$|Acute mercury {{exposure}} {{has given}} rise to psychotic reactions such as delirium, hallucinations, and suicidal tendency. Occupational exposure has resulted in erethism, with irritability, excitability, excessive shyness, and insomnia as the principal features of a broad-ranging <b>functional</b> <b>disturbance.</b> With continuing exposure, a fine tremor develops, initially involving the hands and later spreading to the eyelids, lips, and tongue, causing violent muscular spasms in the most severe cases. The tremor is reflected in the handwriting which has a characteristic appearance. In milder cases, erethism and tremor regress slowly {{over a period of years}} following removal from exposure. Decreased nerve conduction velocity in mercury-exposed workers has been demonstrated. Long-term, low-level exposure has been found to be associated with less pronounced symptoms of erethism, characterized by fatigue, irritability, loss of memory, vivid dreams, and depression (WHO, 1976).|$|E

This hallucination may arise due to a disturbance in the multisensory processing of body and self at the temporo-parietal junction.
