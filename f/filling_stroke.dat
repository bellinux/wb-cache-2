40|$|Orbital {{measurements}} of the cardiac function of Space Shuttle crew members have shown an initial increase in cardiac stroke volume upon entry into weightlessness followed by a gradual reduction in stroke volume. In an effort to explain this response, it was postulated that gravity {{plays a role in}} cardiac filling. A mock circulation system was designed to investigate this effect. Preliminary studies carried out on the NASA KC- 135 aircraft, which provides brief periods of weightlessness, showed a strong correlation between cardiac <b>filling,</b> <b>stroke</b> volume, and {{the presence or absence of}} gravity. The need for extended periods of high quality zero gravity was identified to verify this observation. To accomplish this, the aircraft version of the experiment was reduced in size and fully automated for eventual integration into a Get-Away-Special canister for the orbital version of the experiment. Three nonlinearities, that govern the ability of the apparatus to regulate to a mean cardiac outflow pressure of 95 mm Hg, were identified and minimized.

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} volume loading in the low output state associated with right ventricular infarction, isolated right ventricular infarction was produced in seven dogs with the pericardium intact. Volume loading and pericardiotomy were then sequentially performed. After the production of right ventricular infarction, right ventricular systolic pressure decreased by 25 %, aortic pressure by 36 % and cardiac output by 32 %. Right ventricular ejection fraction decreased by 57 %, but left ventricular ejection fraction did not change significantly. Left ventricular transmural pressure and diastolic size decreased, and right ventricular diastolic size increased. Intrapericardial pressure increased and equalization of diastolic pressures was noted. Volume loading resulted in increased right ventricular systolic pressure and stroke work, increased aortic pressure and cardiac output and increased transmural pressure and diastolic size in both ventricles. Pericardiotomy resulted in further increases in right and left ventricular <b>filling,</b> <b>stroke</b> work and cardiac output, as well as resolution of equalized diastolic pressures. These results indicate that cardiac output in experimental right ventricular infarction increases with volume loading, which enhances left ventricular preload by augmenting right ventricular output. Elevated intrapericardial pressure affects filling of both ventricles and {{may play a role}} in the pathophysiology of low cardiac output in right ventricular infarction...|$|E
40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} atrial and ventricular function in patients undergoing cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). BackgroundRight atrial pacing (AP) in CRT induces delays in electrical and mechanical activation of the left atrium. The influence of atrial sensing (AS) versus AP on ventricular performance in CRT and the mechanisms underlying the differences between AS and AP in CRT have not been fully elucidated. MethodsFifty-five patients with heart failure undergoing CRT for 9 ± 12. 5 months and 22 control subjects without heart failure were enrolled. Conventional and tissue Doppler echocardiography was performed to examine atrial and ventricular mechanics and hemodynamic status. ResultsThe optimal atrioventricular interval was shorter in AS compared with AP mode (126 ± 19 ms vs. 155 ± 20 ms, p < 0. 0001). Left ventricular (LV) outflow tract time-velocity integral (22 ± 7 cm vs. 20 ± 7 cm, p < 0. 001), diastolic filling period (468 ± 124 ms vs. 380 ± 93 ms, p < 0. 001), and global strain (− 32 ± 24 % vs. − 27 ± 22 %, p = 0. 001) were greater in AS compared with AP mode. Atrial strain was higher in AS compared with AP mode in the right atrium (− 28. 2 ± 8. 6 % vs. − 22. 6 ± 7. 6 %, p = 0. 0007), interatrial septum (− 17. 1 ± 6. 5 % vs. − 13. 2 ± 5. 4 %, p = 0. 002), and left atrium (− 16. 4 ± 11. 0 % vs. − 13. 6 ± 8. 5 %, p = 0. 02). There was no difference in intraventricular dyssynchrony but significantly lower atrial dyssynchrony in AS compared with AP mode (31 ± 19 ms vs. 42 ± 24 ms, p = 0. 0002). ConclusionsAS is associated with preserved atrial contractility and atrial synchrony, resulting in optimal LV diastolic <b>filling,</b> <b>stroke</b> volume, and LV systolic mechanics.

30|$|Left {{ventricular}} dysfunction {{in patients}} with pulmonary hypertension {{can be caused by}} synchronous coronary disease or a congenital defect, or can be secondary to the haemodynamic effects of pulmonary hypertension on the left ventricle.

In addition, the septal bowing further reduces the LV volume in early diastole, thus limiting the LV filling process during the most important phase of rapid filling [6].

Leads I, aVF, V 10, V 1 R, V 3 R, V 1 L and V 3 L were used. It was aimed to assess the incidence of abnormal T waves in this breed, according to the criteria of abnormalities established for other equine breeds, to evaluate if the changes induced by training in the T wave are the same that those reported in the athletic heart syndrome in canine and human athletes and, to analyse if the abnormal T waves could have been related to changes in the plasma concentrations of Na, K, and Cl, since these electrolytes are involved in the cardiac electrical processes. It was found out that the incidence of abnormal T waves was quite high in the Andalusian breed, especially in the precordial leads. Moreover, the incidence of abnormal T waves increased in pre-cordial leads and decreased in lead I and aVF after training. The abnormal T waves after training were shorter and had the same voltage, changes which were different to those presented for the athlete’ heart syndrome. The horses with abnormal T waves had higher plasma K concentrations, both before and after training. Plasma Na and Cl concentration at rest decreased after training.

40|$|Background and Aim: Mechanical global left {{ventricular}} (LV) dyssynchrony reflected as prolonged total isovolumic time(t-IVT) {{has been introduced}} as a potential mechanism behind compromised stroke volume in heart failure (HF). It has alsobeen shown to be superior to other markers of dyssynchrony in predicting response to cardiac resynchronization therapy(CRT), but its application in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) remains unknown. The {{aim of this study}} was toassess the role of t-IVT in explaining symptoms in HFpEF. Methods: In 55 symptomatic HFpEF patients (age 60 ± 9 years, NYHA class II-IV; LV EF ≥ 45 %) and 24 age and gendermatched controls, a complete Doppler echocardiographic study was performed including mitral annulus peak systolicexcursion (MAPSE) and myocardial velocities as well as LV filling, outflow tract velocity time integral (VTI) and stroke volumemeasurements. Global LV dyssynchrony was assessed by t-IVT [in s/min; calculated as: 60 - (total ejection time + total fillingtime) ], Tei index (t-IVT/ejection time) and pre-ejection time difference between LV and RV. Results: Patients had reduced lateral and septal MAPSE (p= 0. 009 and p= 0. 01, respectively) lower lateral and septal s’(p= 0. 002 and p= 0. 04, respectively) and e’ (p< 0. 001, for both) velocities and higher E/e’ ratio (p= 0. 01) compared to controls. They also had longer t-IVT (p< 0. 001), higher Tei index (p= 0. 04), but similar pre-ejection time difference and LVEF to controls. T-IVT correlated with LV filling time (r= 0. 44, p< 0. 001), stroke volume (r=- 0. 41; p= 0. 002), MAPSE (lateral: r=- 0. 36, p= 0. 007 andseptal: r=- 0. 31; p= 0. 02), but not with LV mass index, LVEF, E/e’ ratio or QRS duration. Conclusion: Patients with HFpEF have exaggerated global mechanical dyssynchrony shown by prolonged t-IVT, comparedwith healthy age and gender matched controls. The relationship between t-IVT, LV <b>filling</b> and <b>stroke</b> volume suggests anassociation, more important than with ejection fraction or electrical dyssynchrony.

40|$|After {{complete}} cardiovascular denervation mean {{arterial pressure}} (MAP) falls to almost equally low levels in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) and normotensive control rats (NCR). This has earlier been suggested to indicate a dominance of neurogenic mechanisms in established SHR hypertension. –In the present study, total peripheral resistance (TPR) remains, however, some 35 per cent higher in adult SHR than in NCR after pithing while cardiac output (CO), and stroke volume, is 35 per cent lower in SHR. These opposite differences in TPR and CO after denervation, resulting in equal MAP levels in SHR and NCR, seem rather to be {{a consequence of the}} rapidly established structural adaptation that affects all SHR high-pressure cardiovascular sections. Thus, the SHR precapillary resistance vessels display thick- ened walls and luminal narrowing, which keeps TPR higher than in NCR even during maximal vaso- dilatation. Due to hypertrophy, the SHR left ventricle exhibits a reduced myocardial stretch for a given <b>filling</b> pressure and <b>stroke</b> volume is consequently reduced more than in NCR after complete denervation. –Paradoxically, therefore, rather than reflecting any dominance of neurogenic mechanisms in established SHR hypertension the MAP equalization in SHR and NCR after cardiovascular denervation emphasizes the hemodynamic importance of cardiovascular structural changes present in hypertension...|$|R
40|$|Background and objective: The haemodynamics of crystalloid and colloid {{fluid loading}} {{may depend on}} {{underlying}} disease, i. e. sepsis versus non-sepsis. Design and setting: A single-centre, single-blinded, randomized clinical trial was carried out on 24 critically ill sepsis and 24 non-sepsis patients with clinical hypovolaemia, assigned to loading with normal saline, gelatin 4 %, hydroxyethyl starch 6 % or albumin 5 % in a 90 -min (delta) central venous pressure (CVP) -guided fluid loading protocol. Transpulmonary thermodilution was done each 30 min, yielding, among others, global end-diastolic volume and cardiac indices (GEDVI, CI). Results: Sepsis patients had hyperdynamic hypotension in spite of myocardial depression and dilatation, and greater inotropic/vasopressor requirements than non-sepsis patients. Independent of underlying disease, CVP and GEDVI increased more after colloid than saline loading (P < 0. 018), so that CI increased by about 2 % after saline and 12 % after colloid loading (P = 0. 029). The increase in preload-recruitable stroke work was also greater with colloids and did not differ among conditions. Conclusion: Fluid loading with colloids results in a greater linear increase in cardiac <b>filling,</b> output and <b>stroke</b> work than does saline loading, in both septic and non-septic clinical hypovolaemia, in spite of myocardial depression and presumably increased vasopermeability potentially decreasing the effects of colloid fluid loading in the former. © The Author(s) 2010...|$|R
40|$|Fifteen {{patients}} with {{acute myocardial infarction}} and an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure were given 40 mg furosemide intravenously within 24 hr of diagnosis of infarction. We divided the patients into two groups {{on the basis of}} the diuretic response to furosemide: nine who responded with a diuresis of greater than 400 ml in two hours, and six with a lower diuresis. The nine patients who responded well had a 35 % fall in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure, from 21 to 12 mm Hg (P< 0. 01), accompanied by a small but significant decrease in arterial pressure at the end of two hours. There was no apparent increase in left ventricular function in these patients as shown by the relationship of left ventricular <b>filling</b> pressure and <b>stroke</b> work index, but all survived. The nonresponders failed to show significant hemodynamic changes, were significantly older, had a higher serum urea nitrogen (SUN) than the responders and had higher pulmonary capillary wedge pressures. Despite further therapy with much higher doses of furosemide and digitalis, five of the six nonresponders (83 %) died. Furosemide is of value in relieving pulmonary congestion in {{patients with}} moderate congestive heart failure associated with myocardial infarction.

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to explore in {{pulmonary}} arterial hypertension (PAH) whether the cause of interventricular asynchrony lies in onset of shortening or duration of shortening. BackgroundIn PAH, leftward ventricular septal bowing (LVSB) is probably caused by a left-to-right (L-R) delay in myocardial shortening. MethodsIn 21 PAH patients (mean pulmonary arterial pressure 55 ± 13 mm Hg and electrocardiogram–QRS width 100 ± 16 ms), magnetic resonance imaging myocardial tagging (14 ms temporal resolution) was applied. For the left ventricular (LV) free wall, septum, and right ventricular (RV) free wall, the onset time (Tonset) and peak time (Tpeak) of circumferential shortening were calculated. The RV wall tension was estimated by the Laplace law. ResultsThe Tonset was 51 ± 23 ms, 65 ± 4 ms, and 52 ± 22 ms for LV, septum, and RV, respectively. The Tpeak was 293 ± 58 ms, 267 ± 22 ms, and 387 ± 50 ms for LV, septum, and RV, respectively. Maximum LVSB was at 395 ± 45 ms, coinciding with septal overstretch and RV Tpeak. The L-R delay in Tonset was − 1 ± 16 ms (p = 0. 84), and the L-R delay in Tpeak was 94 ± 41 ms (p < 0. 001). The L-R delay in Tpeak was not related to the QRS width but was associated with RV wall tension (p < 0. 05). The L-R delay in Tpeak correlated with leftward septal curvature (p < 0. 05) and correlated negatively with LV end-diastolic volume (p < 0. 05) and stroke volume (p < 0. 05). ConclusionsIn PAH, the L-R delay in myocardial peak shortening is caused by lengthening of the duration of RV shortening. This L-R delay is related to LVSB, decreased LV <b>filling,</b> and decreased <b>stroke</b> volume...|$|R
40|$|Background—Cardiac {{magnetic}} resonance (CMR) is established for assessment of left ventricular (LV) systolic function {{but has not}} been widely used to assess diastolic function. This study tested performance of a novel CMR segmentation algorithm (LV-METRIC) for automated assessment of diastolic function. Methods and Results—A total of 101 patients with normal LV systolic function underwent CMR and echocardiography (echo) within 7 days. LV-METRIC generated LV filling profiles via automated segmentation of contiguous short-axis images (20439 images, 2 : 040 : 53 minutes). Diastolic function by CMR was assessed via early:atrial filling ratios, peak diastolic filling rate, time to peak filling rate, and a novel index—diastolic volume recovery (DVR), calculated as percent diastole required for recovery of 80 % stroke volume. Using an echo standard, patients with versus without diastolic dysfunction had lower early:atrial filling ratios, longer time to peak <b>filling</b> rate, lower <b>stroke</b> volume–adjusted peak diastolic filling rate, and greater DVR (all P 0. 05). Prevalence of abnormal CMR filling indices increased in relation to clinical symptoms classified by New York Heart Association functional class (P 0. 04) or dyspnea (P 0. 006). Among all parameters tested, DVR yielded optimal performance versus echo (area under the curve: 0. 870. 04, P 0. 001). Using a 90 % specificity cutoff, DVR yielded 74 % sensitivity for diastolic dysfunction. In multivariate analysis, DVR (odds ratio, 1. 82; 95 % CI, 1. 13 to 2. 57; P 0. 02) was independently associated with echo-evidenced diastolic dysfunction after controlling for age, hypertension, and LV mass (273. 4, P 0. 001). Conclusions—Automated CMR segmentation can provide LV filling profiles that may offer insight into diastolic dysfunction. Patients with diastolic dysfunction have prolonged diastolic filling intervals, which are associated with echo-evidenced diastolic dysfunction independent of clinical and imaging variables.

The values were compared with those in 10 normal subjects of comparable age. The filling fractions between 10 % and 70 % of the diastolic time interval were greater in patients with pericardial constriction than in those with restrictive cardiomyopathy (p < 0. 01 between 20 % and 50 %, p < 0. 05 at 10 %, 60 % and 70 %), with no overlap. The filling fractions in patients with pericardial constriction were also greater than those in normal subjects between 10 % and 60 % of the diastolic time interval. The filling fraction was lower in patients with restrictive cardiomyopathy than in normal subjects at 40 % of the diastolic time interval (p < 0. 05). The time to peak filling rate in patients with pericardial constriction was shorter (110 ± 14 ms) than in those with restrictive cardiomyopathy (195 ± 45 ms, p < 0. 01) or in normal subjects (173 ± 32 ms, p < 0. 01).

Likewise, indices of each region were derived from S and dS/dt. We also calculated global and regional ejection fraction (EF), mean normalized systolic ejection rate (MNSER), time constant (T), and global and regional indices of compliance at end-diastole [(dV/VdP) ed, (dS/SdP) ed] In AP group, global diastolic (prolongation of T, decrease of nPFR) and systolic (decrease of EF,MNSER and nPER) function were simultaneously impaired, and regional diastolic (decrease of nPFR and RFF) and systolic decrease of EF and nPER) function were also impaired in the affected region supplied by LAD. While the rapid filling was impaired, nPAFR was maintained and AFF increased in the affected region of AP group. Furthermore. nPFR had a significant inverse correlation (r=- 0. 57,p< 0. 01) with AFF in anterior region. In the affected region oi AP group, (dS/SdP) ed tended to increase. Thus, we concluded that patients with isolated LAD disease had a simultaneous impairment of LV systolic anddiastolic function. Although the rapid filling was impaired, the passive filling during atrial contraction was preserved in the affected region of AP group...|$|R
40|$|Patients {{with severe}} lung {{emphysema}} have poor {{quality of life}} because of impaired lung function and reduced exercise tolerance. Concomitant heart disease in severe emphysema is well recognised. The prevailing view is that mainly {{the right side of}} the heart is involved, while the issue of left ventricular (LV) involvement is less studied. The aim of this thesis was to evaluate cardiac performance and dimensions in patients with severe emphysema, using pulmonary artery thermodilution technique, transoesophageal echocardiography and magnetic resonance imaging. The main findings were that patients with severe emphysema have impaired cardiac performance as reflected in subnormal values of stroke volume and cardiac output compared with patients/volunteers with normal lung function. This impaired cardiac performance is caused by inadequate diastolic filling (decreased preload) of the right and left ventricle. Myocardial contractility is not affected, but the left ventricle is hypovolemic and operates on a steeper portion of the LV function curve. One possible explanation for the decreased biventricular preload is a low intrathoracic blood volume caused by the hyperinflated lungs. In patients with severe emphysema, lung volume reduction surgery improves LV end-diastolic dimensions and filling and thereby performance, which at least partly could explain the improved exercise tolerance seen after the operation. 	Levosimendan has combined inotropic and vasodilatory effects and is used in the treatment of severe heart failure. The effect on diastolic function in humans is not entirely understood. Therefore, the aim was to evaluate whether levosimendan has lusitropic effect in patients with diastolic dysfunction, using pulmonary artery thermodilution technique and transoesophageal echocardiography. The main finding was that levosimendan shortens isovolumic relaxation time and improves LV early filling. In conclusion, patients with severe emphysema have compromised cardiac performance as reflected in impaired LV <b>filling</b> and low <b>stroke</b> volume. The decreased ventricular preload is explained by a low intrathoracic blood volume most likely caused by the hyperinflated lungs. Lung volume reduction surgery, improves LV function. Levosimendan exerts a direct positive lusitropic effect in patients with diastolic dysfunction...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is {{the leading}} cause of death and {{disability}} in the United States. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of increased utilization of CVD medications on MI, stroke, and all-cause mortality among different CVD risk subgroups. Methods: We used 1999 - 2009 Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey data to identify 26, 903 non-institutionalized, fee-for-Service Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older who were users of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), other antihypertensive medications, and statin. These beneficiaries contributed a total of 61, 741 person-years. For each study drug, we used logistic regression models to estimate the effect of additional prescription <b>fills</b> on MI, <b>stroke,</b> and all-cause mortality; stratified according to presence of CVD and, in those without CVD, level of CVD risk (high versus low). Results: Additional prescription fills of ACE, ARB, other antihypertensives, or statin did not affect MI occurrence among high CVD risk individuals; while in those with CVD, significant effects of ACE and statin were found: OR per 6 additional fills: 0. 76 (95 % CI= 0. 59, 0. 98) and 0. 74 (CI= 0. 60, 0. 92) respectively. Additional drug fills did not affect stroke in either subpopulation except fills of other antihypertensives in the CVD subgroup (OR of 6 additional fills: 0. 93 (CI= 0. 89, 0. 98). In both subgroups, an inverse relationship between increased use of the study drugs and all-cause mortality was generally found although insignificant. For those at lower CVD risk, events were generally too few to allow multivariate analyses. Conclusions: We found inverse relationships between increased use of some CVD medications; and MI, stroke, and mortality (although some were not significant) for some subpopulations but not others. Future research is needed to confirm this to justify the need to eliminate or reduce copays for these drugs for some subgroups that may benefit most from them...|$|R
40|$|Aim of {{the study}} was to examine the {{relation}} between Doppler-derived indices of left ventricular diastolic and systolic function early after myocardial infarction. Fifty-three patients (31 males, 22 females) recovering from acute myocardial infarction underwent predischarge Doppler echocardiographic examination. Patients with age > 70 years, previous myocardial infarction, more than mild mitral and aortic regurgitation, mitral and aortic stenosis were excluded. Twenty-two healthy subjects (13 males; 9 females) free of coronary risk factors were selected as the control group. Both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes and ejection fraction were measured by two-dimensional echocardiography. Pulsed Doppler was used to evaluate mitral inflow and left ventricular outflow velocity patterns. The following indices were measured: peak velocity of early (E) and late (A) flows, ratio of E/A peak velocities, ratio of early to late time velocity integrals, atrial filling fraction (time velocity integral A / time velocity integral of flow during total diastole) and deceleration time of E wave for mitral inflow; peak and time-velocity integral for left ventricular outflow. Stroke volume and cardiac output were obtained by pulsed Doppler using the left ventricular outflow method. The two groups were comparable for age, with blood pressure (p < 0. 05) and heart rate (p < 0. 01) reduced in myocardial infarction patients. Both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were significantly higher (both p < 0. 0001) and ejection fraction (p < 0. 0001) lower after myocardial infarction. Also stroke volume and cardiac output (both p < 0. 0001) were reduced in myocardial infarction patients. No significant difference in Doppler indices of diastolic function was observed between the two groups, except for shortened deceleration time (p < 0. 0001) in myocardial infarction patients. Multilinear regression analyses were performed separately into the two groups to identify determinants of left ventricular systolic function. After adjusting for age, heart rate, systolic blood pressure and both end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, atrial filling fraction was an independent predictor of stroke volume, with a direct relation (beta coefficient = 0. 53, p < 0. 001), in myocardial infarction patients but not in health subjects. In conclusion, our study confirms the pseudonormalization of diastolic pattern after myocardial infarction. The direct relation between atrial <b>filling</b> fraction and <b>stroke</b> volume indicates the importance of atrial contribution to maintain an adequate systolic performance in patients with myocardial infarction...|$|R
