5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> constructed in {{a finite number of}} steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
5|$|Thus far, the German fighters had {{performed}} well, {{but now it}} came to {{the most difficult part of}} the operation: withdrawing under attack. The German fighters were low on fuel and could only do so much to protect the bombers. Damaged stragglers lagged behind the main bomber streams and were easy prey for RAF fighters <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> found. The four German raiding formations were all heading in different directions by 13:30: 9 Staffel were well clear to the south, heading back over Beachy Head; KG 1 were completing their bomb run while the Spitfires of 610 were being held at arm's length by JG 54 Bf 109s; the Ju 88s of KG 76 had attacked West Malling and their escorts were battling Nos. 32, 64, 501 and 615 Squadrons. The Dorniers were heading home under attack by elements of 32, 64 and 615 Squadrons. However, further to the east, Nos. 1, 17, 54, 56 and 266 Squadrons totalling 23 Spitfires and 36 Hurricanes were moving in to meet the main formations during their withdrawal.|$|E

In the British POW compounds 58 chickens were provided for 1,000 men for Christmas 1942; the next Christmas the women received a single turkey to share between 271 women and children.

25|$|Around 1900, {{different}} salmon {{were introduced}} as sport fish. Only the king salmon (Chinook) {{adapted to the}} environment. For decades, the development of salmon and trout aquaculture in New Zealand was opposed by recreational fishers, {{on the grounds that}} disease would spread from fish farms into recreational fisheries, and that wild fish would be poached <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sold. In 1973 the government compromised by making trout farms illegal, but salmon farms legal. New Zealand is probably the only country in the world where trout farming is illegal, despite commercial interest from companies already farming salmon.|$|E
25|$|All 85 were {{stripped}} of their uniforms, imprisoned for ten years and shackled - this was a major humiliation. The rebels were from the 3rd cavalry: they owned their horses, and were the upper-caste elite. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> shackled, what could others expect from the Company? On Sunday, 10 May 1857, Kotwal Dhan Singh Gurjar opened {{the gates of the}} prison. These soldiers, along with other imprisoned soldiers escaped prison and declared themselves free, revolted, attacked and killed several of the British authorities to take the city under their control. This marked the beginning of a widespread revolt across northern India as these soldiers marched towards Delhi. 10 May is still celebrated as a local holiday in Meerut.|$|E
25|$|A feather duster is an {{implement}} used for cleaning. It consists typically of a wooden-dowel handle and feathers that are wound onto the handle by a wrapped wire. In 1870, {{the original idea}} for the feather duster was conceived in a broom factory in Jones County, Iowa. A farmer brought a bundle of turkey feathers into the factory asking <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> used to assemble a brush. E.E. Hoag used these feathers to invent the first feather duster. Using a short broom stick and splitting the feathers with a pocket knife, the duster {{was found to be}} too stiff for use. In 1874, the Hoag Duster Company was founded, which became a pioneer of feather dusters in the U.S. state of Iowa.|$|E

25|$|The LZ 130 Graf Zeppelin II {{was finally}} {{launched}} in September 1938. The DZR Board concluded in its annual report for 1939 that {{public interest in}} zeppelins remained strong, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> shown to be safe, {{and a series of}} demonstration and airmail flights were authorized by the Air Ministry and the Reichspost. One of its first flights was a medium-distance trial to Austria following the Anschluss. Over the next 11 months Graf Zeppelin II made 30 test, promotional, and propaganda tours around Europe. With the advent of World War II it flew for the last time on 20 August 1939 and never entered the transatlantic passenger service for which it was built. The fate of the DZR was decided on 4 March 1940, when Air Minister Hermann Göring ordered LZ 127, LZ 130, and the unfinished LZ 131 melted down for reuse in German military aircraft manufacturing. On 6 May 1940, a Wehrmacht demolition team destroyed the hangar complexes at Frankfurt Airport, ending the fortunes of the DZR.|$|E
500|$|Lord Phillips {{noted that}} expert {{witnesses}} (unlike witnesses giving evidence of facts) {{had volunteered to}} give evidence and were doing so for payment. [...] He saw [...] "no justification" [...] for the assumption that experts would be discouraged from providing their services <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> sued.

500|$|There {{are some}} {{theoretical}} indications that other nitrogen oligomers and polymers may be possible. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> synthesised, {{they may have}} potential applications as materials with a very high energy density, {{that could be used}} as powerful propellants or explosives. This is because they should all decompose to dinitrogen, whose N≡N triple bond (bond energy 946kJ⋅mol−1) is much stronger than those of the N=N double bond (418kJ⋅mol−1) or the N–N single bond (160kJ⋅mol−1): indeed, the triple bond has more than thrice the energy of the single bond. (The opposite is true for the heavier pnictogens, which prefer polyatomic allotropes.) A great disadvantage is that most neutral polynitrogens are not expected to have a large barrier towards decomposition, and that the few exceptions would be even more challenging to synthesise than the long-sought but still unknown tetrahedrane. This stands in contrast to the well-characterised cationic and anionic polynitrogens azide (...) , pentazenium (...) , and pentazolide (cyclic aromatic [...] ). Under extremely high pressures (1.1millionatm) and high temperatures (2000K), as produced in a diamond anvil cell, nitrogen polymerises into the single-bonded cubic gauche crystal structure. This structure {{is similar to that of}} diamond, and both have extremely strong covalent bonds, resulting in its nickname [...] "nitrogen diamond".|$|E
500|$|The band {{worked with}} {{multiple}} guest vocalists and musicians, {{many of which}} were not included on the album's final cut. In working with vocalists, the Avalanches wanted to create vocals that meshed seamlessly with the music as <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> samples. Jonathan Donahue of Mercury Rev provided vocals and musical saw instrumentation on multiple tracks. In addition, Kevin Parker of Tame Impala provided additional drumming on [...] "Going Home" [...] and violinist Warren Ellis was featured on [...] "Stepkids". Jean-Michel Bernard also provided some orchestration to a handful of tracks. Both Danny Brown's and Biz Markie's vocals on [...] "Frankie Sinatra" [...] and [...] "The Noisey Eater" [...] respectively were done remotely. For Brown's vocals on [...] "The Wozard of Iz", he visited Sing Sing Studios in Melbourne and had an all-night recording session with the group. Chater was a fan of MF DOOM, specifically the album Madvillainy (2004) he made with Madlib. He sent him a track and received a reply 18 months later from DOOM stating he loved the track and wanted to provide vocals. The group was thrilled to work with Camp Lo on the track [...] "Because I'm Me".

500|$|Prior to the First World War, Rangers did {{not have}} any policy {{regarding}} religion dictating <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> signed or not. Prior to the war, Rangers did have a number of Catholic players. [...] In the 1920s, following the rise in popularity of the Orange Order in Glasgow where Rangers players and directors attended functions, [...] Rangers quietly introduced an unwritten rule that the club would not sign any player or employ any staff member who was openly Catholic. The policy was kept a secret within Rangers until 1965 when Ralph Brand revealed to the News of the World that Rangers operated a Protestants-only policy when he left them for Manchester City. [...] Two years later vice-chairman Matt Taylor was asked about perceived anti-Catholicism with the [...] "No Catholic" [...] signing policy at Rangers, he stated [...] " [...] part of our tradition... we were formed in 1873 as a Protestant boys club. To change now would lose us considerable support". The policy was mirrored by Northern Irish club Linfield, who shares a similar club culture to Rangers, up until the 1980s as a contrast to their Big Two rivals Glentoran though it was not as strict as Rangers'. Some Catholic players did play for Rangers during this time despite the policy with Don Kitchenbrand keeping his Catholicism secret and Laurie Blyth, who left the club after his Catholic faith was discovered. There were also claims by some former Rangers players that the policy extended to non-Catholic players who married Catholics. However the former Rangers player and Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson, himself married to a Catholic, confirmed that marriage to a Catholic was {{not a part of the}} signing policy to exclude players.|$|E
