This study looks at <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> in South Africa in general and the trends of its components in particular. It addresses the impacts of internal and external policies on the disaggregated domestic saving in South Africa. This is done with the aim of establishing the channels through which these policies influence the components of South Africa’s domestic saving. This study focuses on current economic literature while examining <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> and its attributes. A brief discussion of <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> on emerging market region puts sub-Saharan Africa’s <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving,</b> particularly that of South Africa, into perspective. Hence, the developments in South Africa’s domestic saving are compared with those of some selected countries. An analysis of <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> in South Africa for the period 1970 to 2004 indicates a long-run downward pattern. The disaggregated domestic saving in South Africa shows that although three components contributed to the decline in South Africa’s domestic saving, the public sector appeared to be the main culprit in the decline. Thus, the net saving by the government had been negative since early 1980. The study observes that the patterns of saving of the three components are influenced by both internal and external factors. iv These internal and external factors are made up of fiscal and monetary policies, and the balance of payments. Without over-emphasising the importance of <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> in any economy, it is crucial for South Africa to encourage a positive saving culture for improvement in meaningful domestic investment for long-term economic growth. This study, therefore, suggests that in a developing economy like the South African economy, a positive saving attitude could be encouraged through the use of internal and external policies. Hence, the positive impact of internal and external factors could motivate all stakeholders in <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving</b> to seize any available opportunity to boost their savings, thereby raising South Africa’s <b>gross</b> domestic <b>saving...</b>|$|R

We confirm that the determinants of IR hoarding evolve with developments in the global economy. During the pre-GFC period of 1999 - 2006, <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> is associated with higher IR in developing and emerging markets. The negative impact of outward direct investment on IR accumulation is consistent with the recent trend of diverting international assets from the international reserve account into tangible foreign assets; the Joneses' effect lends support to the regional rivalry in hoarding IR as a motivation; and commodity price volatility induces precautionary buffer hoarding. During the 2007 2009 GFC period, previously significant variables become insignificant or display the opposite effect, probably reflecting the frantic market conditions driven by financial instability. Nevertheless, the propensity to import and <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> continue to display strong and even larger positive effects on IR holding. The results from the 2010 2012 post-GFC period are dominated by factors that had been mostly overlooked in earlier decades. While the negative effect of swap agreements and the positive effect of <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> on IR holdings are in line with our expectations, we find a change in the link between outward direct investment and IR in the pre- and post-crisis period.

We confirm that the determining factors of international reserves are evolving with developments in the global economy. From 1999 – 2006, the pre-GFC period, <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> is associated with higher international reserves in developing and emerging markets. An outward direct-investment effect is consistent with the view of diverting international assets from the international reserve account, the “Joneses’ effect” lends support to the rivalry hoarding motivation, and commodity price volatility induces hoarding against uncertainty. During the 2007 – 2009 GFC, those variables became insignificant or displayed the opposite effect, probably reflecting the frantic market conditions that prevent a normal economic relationship to hold. Nevertheless, the propensity to continue to trade displays a strong positive effect. The 2010 – 2012 post-crisis results are dominated by factors that have been mostly overlooked in earlier decades. While the effects of swap agreements and <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> are in line with expectations, we find a change in the link between outward direct investment and international reserves in the pre- and post-crisis period. The macro-prudential policy is found to complement international reserve accumulation. Developed countries display very different demand behaviors for international reserves. Higher <b>gross</b> <b>saving</b> has been associated with lower international reserve holding because developed countries are more likely to deploy their savings in the global capital market.

The model allowed for highlighting some individual particularities of the countries or some characteristics of the groups, showing that the type of saving behaviour is influenced by them.
