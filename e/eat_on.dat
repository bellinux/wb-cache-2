5|$|Copenhagen {{has long}} been {{associated}} with beer. Carlsberg beer has been brewed at the brewery's premises {{on the border between}} the Vesterbro and Valby districts since 1847 and {{has long been}} almost synonymous with Danish beer production. However, recent years have seen an explosive {{growth in the number of}} microbreweries so that Denmark today has more than 100 breweries, many of which are located in Copenhagen. Some like Nørrebro Bryghus also act as brewpubs where it is also possible to <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> the premises.|$|E
5|$|On {{the south}} {{eastern side of}} the house is an orangery, which was built as a {{greenhouse}} in 1701 and has a glazed roof which was added around 1800 by Humphrey Repton. The orangery hides the view of the servants' quarters from the main house. The servants' quarters was revised and modernised in the 1840s. It contains the kitchen, dairy, bakehouse and several larders for raw and cooked meat. There is also a servants' hall where the staff would take their meals and a tenants' hall which was used by the tenant farmers to <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> the days when they came to pay their rent. In addition to the designs for the house, William Talman created the large 15-bay stable block. It is now used as a tea-room for visitors.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimatum}} expired at 09:00 East Africa Time (<b>EAT)</b> <b>on</b> 27 August, {{by which}} time the British had gathered three cruisers, two gunboats, 150 marines and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were {{under the command of}} Rear-Admiral Harry Rawson while their Zanzibaris were commanded by Brigadier-General Lloyd Mathews of the Zanzibar army (who was also the First Minister of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and machine guns, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment opened at 09:02 set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari royal yacht HHS Glasgow and two smaller vessels, and some shots were fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.|$|E

25|$|In Buddhism, honey {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the festival of Madhu Purnima, celebrated in India and Bangladesh. The day commemorates Buddha's making peace among his disciples by retreating into the wilderness. The legend has it that while he was there, a monkey brought him honey to <b>eat.</b> <b>On</b> Madhu Purnima, Buddhists remember this act by giving honey to monks. The monkey's gift is frequently depicted in Buddhist art.|$|E
25|$|On weekdays of {{the first}} week of Great Lent, fasting is {{particularly}} severe, and many observe it by abstaining from all food for some period of time. According to strict observance, on the first five days (Monday through Friday) there are only two meals eaten, one on Wednesday and the other on Friday, both after the Presanctified Liturgy. Those who are unable to follow the strict observance may <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> Tuesday and Thursday (but not, if possible, on Monday) in the evening after Vespers, when they may take bread and water, or perhaps tea or fruit juice, but not a cooked meal. The same strict abstention is observed during Holy Week, except that a vegan meal with wine and oil is allowed on Great Thursday.|$|E

25|$|Circumcision is an {{important}} ritual among the Tanala, {{as in many other}} Malagasy ethnic groups. A range of fady are associated with the practice, particularly for nobles. A noble Tanala mother became subject to a new range of fady after the circumcision of her son. She was thereafter forbidden to take her son for a walk, <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> her own bed or in secret, or consume dried meat of any kind or the meat of a zebu that had been slaughtered (as opposed to having died of natural causes). If she broke any of these taboos, or if the child urinated or defecated during the circumcision ceremony, the child would lose his noble status (an older fady previously required that the child be put to death in such cases).|$|E
25|$|Yom Kippur is {{considered}} {{to be the most important}} day of the Jewish year-cycle and fasting as a means of repentance is expected of every Jewish man or woman above the age of bar mitzvah and bat mitzvah respectively. This is the only fast day mentioned in the Torah (Leviticus 23:26-32). It is so important to fast on this day, that only those who would be put in mortal danger by fasting are exempt, such as the ill or frail (endangering a life is against a core principle of Judaism). Those that do <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> this day are encouraged to eat as little as possible at a time and to avoid a full meal. For some, fasting on Yom Kippur {{is considered}} more important than the prayers of this holy day. If one fasts, even if one is at home in bed, one is considered as having participated in the full religious service.|$|E
25|$|Tithes are broken-off {{during the}} Sabbatical year (such {{as when the}} ground lies fallow), during which year, all fruits, grains and {{vegetables}} that are grown of themselves in that year are considered free and ownerless property. For example, whatever lands were held by those returning from the Babylonian exile {{at the time of}} Ezra are forbidden to be ploughed and sown by any Jew during the Seventh year, and even if gentiles were to plough such land and sow it, the produce would be forbidden unto Jews to <b>eat.</b> <b>On</b> the other hand, the extension of such lands held by the people of Israel who departed Egypt and who entered the Land of Canaan under their leader, Joshua, are forbidden to be ploughed by any Jew during the Seventh year, but if gentiles had ploughed such land and sown it, the produce is permitted to be eaten by a Jew. If on a regular week-year, fruits and grains and vegetables, if grown by an Israelite in these places, would require tithing.|$|E

25|$|Pakistanis {{generally}} eat {{three meals}} a day, which are breakfast, lunch, and dinner. During the evening, many families have tea without sugar, which goes along with baked/fried snacks from a local bakery (or prepared at home). During the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, the eating patterns change to sehri and iftar. It is considered proper to eat only with the right hand as per Islamic tradition (also a tradition in many other Asian cultures). Many Pakistani families, particularly when guests are too many to fit at a table, eat sitting at a cloth known as Dastarkhān, which is {{spread out on the}} floor. In Pakistan, many street eateries serve food on a takht, in a style similar to what is seen in Afghanistan. A takht is a raised platform, where people eat their food sitting cross-legged, after taking their shoes off. Most Pakistanis used to <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> a takht. Pakistanis often eat with their hands, scooping up solid food along with sauce with a piece of baked bread (naan) or rice.|$|E
25|$|At sizes {{less than}} 50cm, the giant {{trevally}} is a silvery-grey fish, {{with the head}} and upper body slightly darker in both sexes. Fish greater than 50cm show sexual dimorphism in their colouration, with males having dusky to jet-black bodies, while females are a much lighter coloured silvery-grey. Individuals with darker dorsal colouration often also display striking silvery s and markings on {{the upper part of}} their bodies, particularly their backs. Black dots of a few millimetres in diameter may also be found scattered all over the body, although the coverage of these dots varies between widespread to none at all. All the fins are generally light grey to black, although fish taken from turbid waters often have yellowish fins, with the anal fin being the brightest. The leading edges and tips of the anal and dorsal fins are generally lighter in colour than {{the main part of the}} fins. There is no black spot on the operculum. Traces of broad cross-bands on the fish's sides are occasionally seen after death. The fishes have been known to prey and <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> the dead fish.|$|E

500|$|Like most European {{restaurant}}s, La Caravelle had a {{menu that}} changed daily. This made the restaurant popular with new customers and also {{brought them back}} regularly. Salvador Dalí, John Lindsay, Leland Hayward, Walter Cronkite and Dorothy Kilgallen often dined at the restaurant in its early years. President John F. Kennedy was especially fond of La Caravelles vichyssoise and chicken in champagne sauce, and he often requested them as [...] "take out" [...] orders to <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> the plane while traveling.|$|E
500|$|With {{the fall}} of the Taliban, Pope John Paul II {{requested}} that Fr. Moretti return to Afghanistan. The first Mass in 9 years was celebrated on January 27, 2002, for members of the International Security Force and various members of foreign agencies. On May 16, 2002, a mission sui iuris was created for all of Afghanistan. There is only one functioning chapel in the country, in the Italian Embassy in Kabul. Projects of the new mission include a [...] "Peace School" [...] for 500 students that began construction in August 2003 and will be to [...] "European standards". Three religious sisters also work with those who have mental disabilities in the capital city, teaching those with cerebral palsy how to go to the toilet and how to <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> their own. The small community went through a period of crisis during the kidnapping on May 17, 2005, of Clementina Cantoni, a member of CARE International, by four gunmen in Kabul as she walked to her car. Sisters from the Missionaries of Charity had their house blessed on May 9, 2006, and have already started taking in street children. There had been fears that their distinctive blue and white habit would make them stand out and be harassed by Muslims, but their institute is generally respected. Jesuit Relief Services has also applied to join the growing number of religious institutes in the country. Jesuit Refugee Services has recently opened a technical school in Herat for 500 students including 120 girls.|$|E

2500|$|However, {{some of the}} rabbis practiced [...] "magic" [...] {{themselves}} or taught the subject. For instance, Rabbah created a person and sent him to Rav Zeira, and Hanina and Hoshaiah studied every Friday together and created a small calf to <b>eat</b> <b>on</b> Shabbat (Sanhedrin 67b). In these cases, the [...] "magic" [...] was seen more as divine miracles (i.e., coming from God rather than [...] "unclean" [...] forces) than as witchcraft.|$|E
