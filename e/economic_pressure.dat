40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} {{the effect of}} perceived <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> on the ethical attitudes of farmers. We hypothesize that {{an increase in the}} <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> a farmer faces could result in that farmer being more tolerant of unethical conduct than farmers not experiencing <b>economic</b> <b>pressures.</b> To test this hypothesis, we use data from a survey of 3, 000 Missouri farmers with farm sales in excess of $ 10, 000 in 2005 in which farmers were asked how acceptable they considered various unethical or questionable farming practices. The survey also contained questions designed to measure perceived <b>economic</b> <b>pressures.</b> We find evidence that <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> result in a greater willingness of farmers to tolerate unethical conduct, particularly in the case of actions that have the potential of causing harm or that are influenced by law or contract. We also find that the more frequently a farmer reports observing an unethical action, the more acceptable he is of it...|$|R

We present a model to derive the hypothesis that {{an increase in the}} <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> a farmer faces will result in that farmer being more willing to justify or rationalize unethical conduct or to express attitudes more accommodating of unethical conduct than farmers not experiencing <b>economic</b> <b>pressures.</b> We use data from a survey of 3, 000 Missouri farmers with farm sales in excess of $ 10, 000 in 2005. In the survey farmers were asked how acceptable they considered various unethical farming practices.

Interestingly, these results are reversed for actions that are ethically questionable but are not harmful or unlawful. Farm Management,...|$|R

5|$|Discrimination against Jews, longstanding but extralegal {{throughout}} much of Europe at the time, was codified in Germany immediately after the Nazi seizure of power on 30 January 1933. The Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service, passed on 7 April of that year, excluded most Jews from the legal profession and the civil service. Similar legislation soon deprived Jewish members of other professions {{of the right to}} practise. Violence and <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> were used by the regime to force Jews to leave the country. Jewish businesses were denied access to markets, forbidden to advertise in newspapers, and deprived of access to government contracts. Citizens were harassed and subjected to violent attacks and boycotts of their businesses.|$|E
5|$|In 1939, the United States had renounced {{its trade}} treaty with Japan; and, {{beginning}} with an aviation gasoline ban in July 1940, Japan became subject to increasing <b>economic</b> <b>pressure.</b> During this time, Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September. Despite several offensives by both sides, {{the war between}} China and Japan was stalemated by 1940. To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces {{in the event of}} a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina. Afterwards, the United States embargoed iron, steel and mechanical parts against Japan. Other sanctions soon followed.|$|E

As a result of the Internal Settlement, elections were held in April 1979, concluding with the United African National Council (UANC) carrying a majority of parliamentary seats. On 1 June 1979, Muzorewa, the UANC head, became prime minister and the country's name was changed to Zimbabwe Rhodesia. The Internal Settlement left control of the Rhodesian Security Forces, civil service, judiciary, and a third of parliament seats to whites. On 12 June, the United States Senate voted to lift <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> on the former Rhodesia.|$|E

40|$|When {{social and}} <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> {{are placed on}} a society {{it would appear that}} {{something}} almost has to give. Certain factions of society, those that are mostly deeply affected by these social and <b>economic</b> <b>pressures,</b> react to how their everyday lives have been stretched to the limit by rioting. The most recent example of this is the summer riots of 2011. This link between social and <b>economic</b> <b>pressures</b> and rioting is historic as in 2001 civil unrest erupted in England’s northern mill towns.

5|$|Legalized {{discrimination}} against Jews in Germany began {{immediately after the}} Nazi seizure of power in January 1933. Violence and <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> were used by the Nazi regime to encourage Jews to voluntarily leave the country. The ideology of Nazism brought together elements of antisemitism, racial hygiene, and eugenics and combined them with pan-Germanism and territorial expansionism {{with the goal of}} obtaining more Lebensraum (living space) for the Germanic people. Nazi Germany attempted to obtain this new territory by attacking Poland and the Soviet Union, intending to deport or exterminate the Jews and Slavs living there, who were viewed as being inferior to the Aryan master race.|$|E
5|$|The {{planners}} envisaged that a {{war with}} Japan would have three phases: while the garrison of Singapore defended the fortress, the fleet would make its way from home waters to Singapore, sally to relieve or recapture Hong Kong, and blockade the Japanese home islands to force Japan to accept terms. The idea of invading Japan was rejected as impractical, but British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. Aware {{of the impact of}} a blockade on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, they felt that <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> would suffice.|$|E

After returning to Germany in 1933, he joined the Sicherheitsdienst (SD; Security Service), where he was appointed {{head of the department}} responsible for Jewish affairs—especially emigration, which the Nazis encouraged through violence and <b>economic</b> <b>pressure.</b> After the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, Eichmann and his staff arranged for Jews to be concentrated in ghettos in major cities with the expectation that they would be transported either farther east or overseas. Eichmann drew up plans for a Jewish reservation, first at Nisko in south-east Poland and later in Madagascar, but neither of these plans were ever carried out.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{authorities}} {{had won a}} total military victory, they refrained from inflicting further draconian measures on the general population. The whole affair had clearly demonstrated that the cities depended on the support of their rural subjects. Putting down the insurrection had been achieved only with difficulties, and only {{with the help of}} troops from Zürich and Uri. Had the peasants succeeded to extend the Huttwil League to encompass the countryside of Zürich, the outcome of the conflict might have been different. The city authorities were well aware of their essentially lucky escape, and their actions in the following years reflect it. While they took steps to disempower the rural population politically, they also fulfilled many of the peasants original fiscal demands, alleviating the <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> on them. Tax reforms were passed, to the point that for instance in the canton of Lucerne the overall taxation of the population decreased {{in the second half of}} the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Nazi Germany used {{violence}} and <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> to encourage Jews to leave Germany {{of their own}} volition; around 250,000 of the country's 437,000 Jews emigrated between 1933 and 1939. Eichmann travelled to British Mandatory Palestine with his superior Herbert Hagen in 1937 to assess the possibility of Germany's Jews voluntarily emigrating to that country, disembarking with forged press credentials at Haifa, whence they travelled to Cairo in Egypt. There they met Feival Polkes, {{an agent of the}} Haganah, with whom they were unable to strike a deal. Polkes suggested that more Jews should be allowed to leave {{under the terms of the}} Haavara Agreement, but Hagen refused, surmising that a strong Jewish presence in Palestine might lead to their founding an independent state, which would run contrary to Reich policy. Eichmann and Hagen attempted to return to Palestine a few days later, but were denied entry after the British authorities refused them the required visas. They prepared a report on their visit, which was published in 1982.|$|E
5|$|Spain {{tried to}} regain control of Gibraltar, which Britain had {{declared}} a Crown colony, through military, diplomatic and <b>economic</b> <b>pressure.</b> Gibraltar was besieged and heavily bombarded during three wars between Britain and Spain but the attacks were repulsed on each occasion. By {{the end of the last}} siege, in the late 18th century, Gibraltar had faced fourteen sieges in 500 years. In the years after Trafalgar, Gibraltar became a major base in the Peninsular War. The colony grew rapidly during the 19th and early 20th centuries, becoming one of Britain's most important possessions in the Mediterranean. It was a key stopping point for vessels en route to India via the Suez Canal. A large British naval base was constructed there at great expense at the end of the 19th century and became the backbone of Gibraltar's economy.|$|E

5|$|The {{third phase}} {{received}} the least consideration, but naval planners {{were aware that}} Singapore was too far from Japan to provide an adequate base for operations close to Japan. Moreover, the further the fleet proceeded from Singapore, the weaker it would become. If American assistance was forthcoming, there was the prospect of Manila {{being used as a}} forward base. The idea of invading Japan and fighting its armies on its own soil was rejected as impractical, but the British planners did not expect that the Japanese would willingly fight a decisive naval battle against the odds. They were therefore drawn to the concept of a blockade. From personal experience they were aware of the impact it could have on an island nation {{at the heart of a}} maritime empire, and felt that <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> would suffice.|$|E
5|$|Frederick Shedden wrote a paper {{putting the}} case for the Singapore {{strategy}} as a means of defending Australia. He argued that since Australia was also an island nation, it followed that it would also be vulnerable to a naval blockade. If Australia could be defeated without an invasion, the defence of Australia had to be a naval one. Colonel John Lavarack, who had attended the Imperial Defence College class of 1928 with Shedden, disagreed. Lavarack responded that the vast coastline of Australia would make a naval blockade very difficult, and its considerable internal resources meant that it could resist <b>economic</b> <b>pressure.</b> When Richmond attacked the Labor Party's position in an article in British Army Quarterly in 1933, Lavarack wrote a rebuttal. In 1936, the leader of the opposition John Curtin read an article by Wynter in the House of Representatives. Wynter's outspoken criticism of the Singapore strategy led to his transfer to a junior post. Soon after the outbreak of war with Germany on 3 September 1939, Prime Minister Robert Menzies appointed a British officer, Lieutenant General Ernest Squires, to replace Lavarack as Chief of the General Staff. Within months, the Chief of the Air Staff was replaced with a British officer as well.|$|E
5|$|Small-scale {{fighting}} continued {{between the}} two countries throughout 1978, as China tried to mediate peace talks {{between the two}} sides. However, neither country could reach an acceptable compromise at the negotiation table. By the end of 1978, Vietnamese leaders decided to remove the Khmer Rouge-dominated regime of Democratic Kampuchea, perceiving it as being pro-Chinese and too hostile towards Vietnam. On 25 December 1978, 150,000 Vietnamese troops invaded Democratic Kampuchea and overran the Kampuchean Revolutionary Army in just two weeks. On 8 January 1979, the pro-Vietnamese People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK) was established in Phnom Penh, marking the beginning of a ten-year Vietnamese occupation. During that period, the Khmer Rouge's Democratic Kampuchea continued to be recognised by the United Nations as the legitimate government of Kampuchea, as several armed resistance groups were formed to fight the Vietnamese occupation. Behind the scenes, Prime Minister Hun Sen of the PRK regime approached factions of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea (CGDK) to begin peace talks. Under heavy diplomatic and <b>economic</b> <b>pressure</b> from the international community, the Vietnamese government implemented a series of economic and foreign policy reforms, which led to their withdrawal from Kampuchea in September 1989.|$|E
