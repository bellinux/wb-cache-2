Ginsburg began, [...] "In a decision of startling breadth, the Court holds that commercial enterprises, including corporations, along with partnerships and sole proprietorships, can opt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.... Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at least {{when there is a}} 'less restrictive alternative.' And such an alternative, the Court suggests, there always will be whenever, in lieu of tolling an enterprise claiming a religion-based exemption, the government, i.e., the general public, can pick up the tab." ...|$|E
2500|$|Justice Scalia {{joined the}} opinion of the Court, and wrote a concurring opinion joined by Justice Alito in <b>full</b> <b>and</b> <b>by</b> Justice Thomas in part. Scalia {{addressed}} Justice Stevens' dissent, specifically with regard to the original understanding of the First Amendment. Scalia said Stevens' dissent was [...] "in splendid isolation from the text of the First Amendment... It never shows why 'the freedom of speech' that was the right of Englishmen did not include the freedom to speak in association with other individuals, including association in the corporate form." [...] He further considered the dissent's exploration of the Framers' views about the [...] "role of corporations in society" [...] to be misleading, and even if valid, irrelevant to the text. Scalia principally argued that the First Amendment was written in [...] "terms of speech, not speakers" [...] and that [...] "Its text offers no foothold for excluding any category of speaker." [...] Scalia argued that the Free Press clause was originally intended to protect the distribution of written materials and did not only apply to the media specifically. [...] This understanding supported the majority's contention that the Constitution does not allow the Court to separate corporations into media and non-media categories.|$|E
60|$|Although {{the boat}} had now twelve men in her, {{she was in}} no danger, being a stout, buoyant six-oared yawl, that might have held twenty, on an emergency. The weather looked promising, too,--the wind being just a good top-gallant breeze, for a ship {{steering}} <b>full</b> <b>and</b> <b>by.</b> The only thing about which I had any qualms, was the circumstance that south-west winds were apt to bring mists, and that the boat might thus be lost. The emergency, nevertheless, was one that justified some risks, and I pursued my plan steadily.|$|E

60|$|So {{together}} {{they walked through}} the crowd of those feasters that remained, {{for most of them}} had already left the hall, who made way, not without reverence, for the brethren of this new star of beauty, on to the terrace, and from the terrace into the gardens. Here they stood awhile in the sweet freshness of the night, which was very grateful after the heated, perfume-laden air of the banquet; then began to wander up and down among the scented trees and flowers. The moon, floating in a cloudless sky, was almost at its <b>full,</b> <b>and</b> <b>by</b> her light they saw a wondrous scene. Under many of the trees and in tents set about here and there, rugs were spread, and to them came men who had drunk of the wine of the feast, and cast themselves down to sleep.|$|E
60|$|The {{first thing}} we did was to clew up the three top-gallant-sails. This gave us a much easier command of the vessel, short-handed as we were, and it {{rendered}} it less hazardous to the spars to keep the Dawn on a wind. When this was done, I ordered the after-braces manned, and the leaches brought as near as possible to touching. It was time; for the oars were heard, and then I got {{a view of the}} boat as it came glancing down on our weather quarter. I instantly gave the order to fill the after sails, and to keep the ship <b>full</b> <b>and</b> <b>by.</b> The braces were manned, as well as they could be, by Marble, Neb and the cook, while I kept an eye on the boat, with an occasional glance at the man at the wheel.|$|E

60|$|Darkness {{shut down}} on them {{suddenly}} as they thrashed her out to westward <b>full</b> <b>and</b> <b>by,</b> lurching with flooded decks over the charging seas. Their whitened tops broke over her, her canvas ran water, and every other minute she plunged into a comber with buried bows. The combers, growing rapidly higher, broke more angrily, and her progress changed {{into a series of}} jerks and plunges, which at times threatened to shake the spars out of her. Frank could see the black mainsail peak above him swinging madly up and down, and it seemed at times that half her length was out of the water, which was not improbably the case, for the foam upon her hove-up deck poured aft in cascades over the low coaming and splashed about their feet. By and by, for she was shallow-bodied like most centerboard craft, it began to gather in a pool which washed to and fro across the floorings in her lee bilge, and at a shout from Jake he started the pump. It needed no priming, for as soon as he unscrewed the covering plate the sea ran down, and there was now nothing to show what water it flung out, because half the lee deck was buried in a rush of gurgling foam and the combers' tops broke continuously over the bows.|$|E
60|$|Finding it {{was likely}} to overblow, we took in our sprit-sail, and stood by to hand the fore-sail; but making foul weather, we looked the guns were all fast, and handed the mizen. The ship lay very broad off, so we thought it better {{spooning}} before the sea, than trying or hulling. We reefed the fore-sail and set him, and hauled aft the fore-sheet; the helm was hard a-weather. The ship wore bravely. We belayed the fore down-haul; but the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard, and got the sail into the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it. It was a very fierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous. We hauled off upon the laniard of the whip-staff, and helped {{the man at the}} helm. We would not get down our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded before the sea very well, and we knew that the top-mast being aloft, the ship was the wholesomer, and made better way through the sea, seeing we had sea-room. When the storm was over, we set fore-sail and main-sail, and brought the ship to. Then we set the mizen, main-top-sail, and the fore-top-sail. Our course was east-north-east, the wind was at south-west. We got the starboard tacks aboard, we cast off our weather-braces and lifts; we set in the lee-braces, and hauled forward by the weather-bowlings, and hauled them tight, and belayed them, and hauled over the mizen tack to windward, and kept her <b>full</b> <b>and</b> <b>by</b> as near as she would lie.|$|E
