Negative autoregulation of the EC genes constitutes the clock's evening loop, replacing the hypothetical <b>component</b> Y. The <b>EC</b> explains our earlier conjecture that the morning gene PSEUDO-RESPONSE REGULATOR 9 was repressed by an evening gene, previously identified with TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION 1 (TOC 1). Our computational analysis suggests that TOC 1 is a repressor of the morning genes LATE ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL and CIRCADIAN CLOCK ASSOCIATED 1 rather than an activator as first conceived. This removes the necessity for the unknown component X (or TOC 1 mod) from previous clock models. As well as matching timeseries and phase-response data, the model provides a new conceptual framework for the plant clock that includes a three-component repressilator circuit in its complex structure. © 2012 EMBO and Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved...|$|R

Although SOC was formed mainly from non-fossil sources (70 % ± 4 %), the role of fossil precursors was substantial (30 % ± 4 %), much higher than at the global scale.

Although {{there is often a}} high initial responsiveness, the majority of patients eventually relapse with platinum-resistant disease. For example, a subset of testicular cancer patients still die even though testicular cancer is considered a paradigm of cisplatin-sensitive solid tumors, but the mechanisms of chemoresistance remain elusive. Here, we have shown that one key determinant of cisplatin-resistance in testicular embryonal carcinoma (EC) is high cytoplasmic expression of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CD K) inhibitor p 21. The <b>EC</b> <b>component</b> of the majority of refractory testicular cancer patients exhibited high cytoplasmic p 21 expression, which protected EC cell lines against cisplatin-induced apoptosis via CDK 2 inhibition. Localization of p 21 in the cytoplasm was critical for cisplatin resistance, since relocalization of p 21 to the nucleus by Akt inhibition sensitized EC cell lines to cisplatin. We also demonstrated in EC cell lines and human tumor tissue that high cytoplasmic p 21 expression and cisplatin resistance of EC were inversely associated with the expression of Oct 4 and miR- 106 b seed family members. Thus, targeting cytoplasmic p 21, including by modulation of the Oct 4 /miR- 106 b/p 21 pathway, may offer new strategies for the treatment of chemoresistant testicular and other types of cancer...|$|R

The suite of brevetoxins and derivatives in seawater is comprised of intra-cellular (IC) and extra-cellular (EC) compounds. We hypothesized that aerosolized compounds are generated primarily from EC, hydrophobic compounds in seawater by bubble-mediated transport. Thus the composition of aerosolized brevetoxins and derivatives, to which beachgoers are exposed, would reflect the EC composition of the source matrix (the local surf zone).

40|$|The {{complexity}} of protein structures calls for simplified representations of their topology. The simplest possible mathematical {{description of a}} protein structure is a onedimensional profile representing, for instance, buriedness or secondary structure. This kind of representation has been introduced for studying the sequence to structure relationship, with applications to fold recognition. Here we define the effective connectivity profile (EC), a network theoretical profile that self-consistently represents the network structure of the protein contact matrix. The EC profile makes mathematically explicit the relationship between protein structure and protein sequence, because it allows predicting the average hydrophobicity profile (HP) and the distributions of amino acids at each site for families of homologous proteins sharing the same structure. In this sense, the EC provides an analytic solution to the statistical inverse folding problem, which consists in finding the statistical properties of the set of sequences compatible with a given structure. We tested these predictions with simulations of the structurally constrained neutral (SCN) model of protein evolution with structure conservation, for singleand multi-domain proteins, and {{for a wide range}} of mutation processes, the latter producing sequences with very different hydrophobicity profiles, finding that the EC-based predictions are accurate even when only one sequence of the family is known. The EC profile is very significantly correlated with the HP for sequence-structure pairs in the PDB as well. The EC profile generalizes the properties of previously introduced structural profiles to modular proteins such as multidomain chains, and its correlation with the sequence profile is substantially improved with respect to the previously defined profiles, particularly for long proteins. Furthermore, the EC profile has a dynamic interpretation, since the <b>EC</b> <b>components</b> are strongly inversely related with the temperature factors measured in X-ray experiments, meaning that positions with large <b>EC</b> <b>component</b> are more strongly constrained in their equilibrium dynamics. Last, the EC profile allows to define a natural measure of modularity that correlates with the number of domains composing the protein, suggesting its application for domain decomposition. Finally, we show that structurally similar proteins have similar EC profiles, so that the similarity between aligned EC profiles can be used as a structure similarity measure, a property that we have recently applied for protein structure alignment.

40|$|The {{origin of}} the high-energy {{component}} in spectral energy distributions (SED) of blazars is still {{a bit of a}} mystery. While BL Lac objects can be rather successfully modeled within the one-zone synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) scenario, the SED of low peaked Flat Spectrum Radio Quasars (FSRQ) is more difficult to reproduce. Their high-energy component needs the abundance of strong external photon sources, giving rise to stronger cooling via the inverse Compton channel, and thusly to a powerful component in the SED. Recently, we were able to show that such a powerful inverse Compton component can also be achieved within the SSC framework. This, however, is only possible if the electrons cool by SSC, which results in a non-linear process, since the cooling depends on an energy integral over the electrons. In this paper we aim to compare the non-linear SSC framework with the external Compton (EC) output by calculating analytically the external Compton component with the underlying electron distribution being either linearly or non-linearly cooled. Due to the additional linear cooling of the electrons with the external photons, higher number densities of electrons are required to achieve non-linear cooling, resulting in more powerful inverse Compton components. If the electrons initially cool non-linearly, the resulting SED can exhibit a dominating SSC over the <b>EC</b> <b>component.</b> However, this dominance depends strongly on the input parameters. We conclude that with the correct time-dependent treatment the SSC component should be taken into account to model blazar flares...|$|R

Because the CD 30 monoclonal antibody Ki- 1 was found to cross-react with an unrelated molecule, we examined by in situ hybridization testicular germ cell neoplasms {{for the presence of}} CD 30 -specific transcripts. CD 30 mRNA was detectable in the tumor cells of 9 of 9 cases of EC or mixed germ cell tumors with an <b>EC</b> <b>component</b> but in no other nonlymphoid tumors. Thus, the CD 30 transcript expression pattern proved to be identical to the immunostaining pattern seen with the CD 30 -specific monoclonal antibody Ber-H 2.

40|$|Abstract: Blazars {{are among}} the most violent sources in the cosmos exhibiting flaring states with remarkably {{different}} variability time scales. Especially rapid flares with flux doubling time scales of the order of minutes have been puzzling for quite some time. Many modeling attempts use the well known linear relations for the cooling and emission processes in the jet in a steady-state scenario, albeit the obvious strongly time-dependent nature of flares. Due to the feedback of the self-produced synchrotron radiation with additional scattering by the relativistic electrons, the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) effect is inherently time-dependent. Recently, in an ongoing series of papers an analytical analysis on the effects of this nonlinear behavior has been presented. Here, we report the results concerning the effect of the time-dependent SSC cooling on the spectral energy distribution (SED), and the synchrotron lightcurves of blazars. For that, we calculated analytically the synchrotron, SSC and external Compton (<b>EC)</b> <b>component</b> of the SED, giving remarkably different spectral features compared to the standard linear approach. We were able to show that the resulting fluxes strongly depend on the parameters, and that SSC could potentially have a strong effect even in sources with strong external photon fields (such as FSRQs), contrary to what is usually assumed. For the synchrotron lightcurve we considered the effects of retardation, including the geometry of the source. The retardation might wash out some effects of the time-dependent cooling, but since lightcurves and SEDs have to be fitted simultaneously with the same set of parameters, the results giv...|$|R

Seven low-grade astrocytic tumors were included for comparison. Classical electron microscopy features of apoptosis were found in lymphoma cells of 21 of 22 subjects. Capillaries of gliomas and lymphomas showed changes reported previously: variability of endothelial cell (EC) -thickness and number, basal lamina thickness and duplication, and fenestrations. Primary CNS B-cell lymphoma ECs showed two distinctive populations of electron-dense and electron-lucent cells. The electron-dense ECs occurred in 38 % of all capillaries, with changes consisting of chromatin condensation in bizarre and contracted nuclei, cytoplasmic shrinkage with markedly increased electron density, and dilatation of the endoplasmic reticulum. We interpreted these changes as indicative of apoptosis. Cell death eventually resulted in complete disintegration of the endothelium with frank discontinuities of the <b>EC</b> <b>component</b> of the blood-tumor barrier in capillaries and postcapillary venules. Another population of ECs had increased cell volume, conspicuous cytoplasmic electron lucency, dispersed organelles, scattered vesicles, and apical stress fibers.

Neither type of EC change was observed in gliomas, which also lacked perivascular neoplastic lymphocytic cuffing.

Results: The intent-to-treat population (ITT) consisted of 44 subjects (n = 22 for BDI- 630; n = 22 for EC). The modified ITT (mITT) population consisted of 40 subjects, excluding four subjects with major protocol deviations related to inclusion/exclusion criteria and/or use of prohibited drugs from {{the efficacy}} analysis (n = 3 for BDI- 630 and n = 1 for EC).

The current study stems from legislative requirements in Queensland that limit the capabilities of both child protection agencies and the RSPCA to cross-report suspected cases of abuse.

However, if deployed arbitrarily, this practice is prone to errors and can often yield irrational results. Three potential methodological problems have been identified, regarding the setting of independent targets for each EC, setting fixed targets, and cascading down targets from the system level to the component level have been identified. In this paper, targets are categorized as constraints and goals because of their different implications for value trade-offs. Then, a ‘multi-attribute utility theory’ based approach is proposed, in which a system value model is developed in order to replace the setting of targets for system <b>ECs</b> and <b>component</b> value models are further derived to replace the setting of targets for <b>component</b> <b>ECs.</b> These value models enhance the traditional approach to requirements specification so that value-based requirements specifications can be developed.

40|$|The role {{of biomass}} burning {{aerosols}} {{in the climate}} system is still poorly quantified, {{in part due to}} uncertainties regarding the optical properties of elemental and organic carbon (EC and OC, respectively), the main constituents of pyrogenic aerosols. In this study, we utilize comprehensive physical and chemical field measurements of biomass burning aerosols in Brazil to constrain the densities and refractive indices (RI) of EC and OC in these particles, by comparing their optically and chemically derived RI. The optically derived effective RI are retrieved from the measured absorption and scattering coefficients using a Mie scattering algorithm, and serve as a reference dataset, while the chemically derived effective RI are calculated from the measured chemical composition using electromagnetic mixing rules. The results are discussed in light of the observed combustion conditions, and in an effort to derive conclusions as to the chemical and optical properties of the usually less well-characterized components of biomass burning aerosols, namely, elemental carbon and organic matter. The best agreement between the optically and chemically derived RI was achieved by assigning a density of rho(EC) = 1. 8 g cm(- 3) and refractive index RIEC = 1. 87 - 0. 22 i to the <b>EC</b> <b>component,</b> and rho = 0. 9 g cm(- 3) and RI = 1. 4 - 0 i to the unidentified organic matter fraction of the particles.

Combining the density and RI of the unidentified organic matter with the properties of the chemically characterized organic fraction yields rho = 1. 1 g cm(- 3) and RI = 1. 3 - 0 i for the total aerosol OC.

In this study we characterize western Amazonia biomass burning emissions through the quantification of 14 Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Organic Carbon, Elemental Carbon and unique tracers of biomass burning such as levoglucosan. From the PAHs dataset a toxic equivalence factor is calculated estimating the carcinogenic and mutagenic potential of biomass burning emissions during the studied period. Peak concentration of PM 10 during the dry seasons was observed to reach 60  μg m− 3 on the 24  h average. Conversely, PM 10 was relatively constant throughout the wet season indicating an overall stable balance between aerosol sources and sinks within the filter sampling resolution. Similar behavior is identified for OC and <b>EC</b> <b>components.</b> Levoglucosan was found in significant concentrations (up to 4  μg m− 3) during the dry season. Correspondingly, the estimated lung cancer risk calculated during the dry seasons largely exceeded the WHO health-based guideline. A source apportionment study was carried out through the use of Absolute Principal Factor Analysis (APFA), identifying a three-factor solution. The biomass burning factor is found to be the dominating aerosol source, having 75. 4 % of PM 10 loading. The second factor depicts an important contribution of several PAHs without a single source class and therefore was considered as mixed sources factor, contributing to 6. 3 % of PM 10. The third factor was mainly associated with fossil fuel combustion emissions, contributing to 18. 4 % of PM 10. This work enhances the knowledge of aerosol sources and its impact on climate variability and local population, on a site representative of the deforestation which occupies a significant fraction of the Amazon basin...|$|R
40|$|Poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) {{chemically}} doped with poly(styrene sulfonic acid) (PEDOT:PSS) is {{a material}} system commonly {{used as a}} conductive and transparent coating in several important electronic applications. The material is also electrochemically active and exhibits electrochromic (EC) properties making it suitable as the active element in EC display applications. In this work uniformly coated PEDOT:PSS layers were used both as the pixel electrode and as the counter electrode in <b>EC</b> display <b>components.</b> The pixel and counter electrodes were separated by a whitish opaque and water-based polyelectrolyte and the thicknesses of the two EC layers were varied independently in order to optimize the color contrast of the display element. A color contrast (ΔE∗, CIE L∗a∗b∗ color space) exceeding 40 was obtained with maintained relatively short switching time at an operational voltage less than 2 V. funding agencies|VINNOVA (research and innovation for sustainable growth in Sweden) |...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{computational}} model described here {{is driven by}} the hypothesis that a major function of the entorhinal cortex (EC) -hippocampal system is to alter synaptic connections in the neocortex. It is based on the following postulates: (1) The EC compares the difference between neocortical representations (primary input) and feedback information conveyed by the hippocampus (the “reconstructed input”). The difference between the primary input and the reconstructed input (termed “error”) initiates plastic changes in the hippocampal networks (error compensation). (2) Comparison of the primary input and reconstructed input requires that these representations are available simultaneously in the EC network. We suggest that compensation of time delays is achieved by predictive structures, such as the CA 3 recurrent network and EC-CA 1 connections. (3) Alteration of intrahippocampal connections gives rise to a new hippocampal output. The hippocampus generates separated (independent) outputs, which, in turn, train long-term memory traces in the <b>EC</b> (independent <b>components,</b> IC). The ICs of the long-term memory trace are generated in a two-step manner, th...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a summary of}} the status of implementation of ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 from the points of view of two program evaluators, drawing from personal experiences. The following aspects are addressed: the evaluators' approach to the review, content and organization of pre-visit materials, suggestions for changes to the present self-study format, means of evaluation of the various <b>EC</b> 2000 <b>components</b> (goal-setting and improvement process, assessment plan, accomplishment of the EC 2000 criteria, program criteria, etc.), communications between the evaluator and the program faculty before, during, and after the visit. This is more necessary than in the past because EC 2000 re{{presents a}}n interwoven set of educational activities and outcomes, compared to the previous criteria. More challenging is the need to assess and document a broad range of types of student outcomes with some degree of quantification, where this has not been attempted (or even considered) in the past. Also, in the authors' experience, {{there is a need to}} assure a more consistent level of documentation of all of the aspects of EC 2000, rather than focusing on a particular portio...|$|R
40|$|A {{relevant}} {{issue in}} panel data estimation is heteroscedasticity, which often {{occurs when the}} sample is large and individual units are of varying size. Furthermore, many of the available panel data sets are unbalanced in nature, because of attrition or accretion, and micro-econometric models applied to panel data are frequently multi-equation models. This paper considers the general least squares estimation of the heteroscedastic stratified two-way error <b>component</b> (<b>EC)</b> models of both single equations and seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR) systems (with cross-equations restrictions) on unbalanced panel data. The derived heteroscedastic estimators of both single equations and SUR systems improve the estimation efficiency. Comment: The paper has been submitted for publicatio...|$|R
