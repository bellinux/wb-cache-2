50|$|The M62 was a {{dedicated}} freight mover and lacked any central heating apparatus for coaches, {{even though most}} Soviet satellite-state customers needed to use them in dual cargo/passenger role regularly (Soviet trains of the era were heated with individual per-coach drum fireplaces). In cold times {{a dedicated}} <b>heating</b> <b>wagon</b> had {{to be added to}} MÁV's M62-drawn trains, producing steam from oil-fired boilers (1960-70s era), later on generating electricity for resistor-based heating (1980s era). This proved to be a high-cost solution, in contrast to the M61 NOHAB, which could produce 750 kg of steam per hour using an internal water tank and engine waste heat, with minimal effects on fuel consumption.|$|R
50|$|This group {{maintains}} {{the most famous}} steam locomotives in the Ulmer Eisenbahnfreunde - 01 1066 and 01 509 - as well as historic, express train, 1st and 2nd class coaches. The vehicles were built between 1928 and 1954.The historic steam express - reinforced by express train coaches from the Passauer Eisenbahnfreunde - travels the length and breadth of Europe visiting, for example, Austria, Italy, France, Hungary, Sweden and Russia (Kaliningrad); albeit remaining mostly in south Germany.The express train steam locomotives and a working <b>heating</b> <b>wagon</b> are stationed at Heilbronn, the coaches in Stuttgart.The non-operational express train engine, number 01 1081, is being refurbished as a museum exhibit in the Augsburg Railway Park.|$|R
2500|$|In April 1907, a tram began {{operation}} in Kiruna, the northernmost in the world. This meant miners {{would no longer}} have to walk several kilometers through the sub-arctic cold, nor would they need to climb a hundred meters up the mining hill. The network consisted of three lines: bergbanan (funicular), stadsspårvägen (city tramway) and gruvspårvägen (mine tramway). The funicular closed in 1955 after a road up the mine was built 1949. The city line had a maximum length of [...] and was unique due to the 1-meter gauge, double windows and <b>heated</b> <b>wagons.</b> It closed in 1958 after gradually being replaced by buses. Between 1941 and 1964, a tram was used inside the mine, with wagons bought from closed tramlines throughout Sweden.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, 109 {{items of}} SM30 {{locomotive}} were modified for <b>heating</b> passenger <b>wagons</b> with 500 V electric heaters, {{and as a}} result their class designation was changed to SP30 (able to pull passenger trains). Those machines remained in regular service until the late 1980s. In 2000 all of them were again, after dismounting heating systems, returned to SM30 series.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{there was}} a great number of private goods wagons, e.g. fishtank wagons for live fish, beer vans and wine <b>wagons,</b> <b>heated</b> fruit vans, dry bulk goods wagons (for goods in powder form), tank and carboy wagons, all of which used components of the Austauschbau wagons as far as possible.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} 1975-1977, forty {{locomotives}} {{were converted to}} SU42 ("diesel universal") class, {{with the addition of}} 500 V electric <b>heating</b> for passenger <b>wagons.</b> Due to withdrawal of such wagons, in 2000 these locomotives were reclassified back to SM42. Another 40 SU42 locomotives, with 3000 V heating, were converted in the years 1999-2000 from PKP class SP42.|$|R
50|$|The Syndicate Ceinture {{passenger}} cars then were largely unheated, oil-lit 'impèriale ouverte' (bilevel cars {{with an open}} top deck) cars, but from 1884 they had ordered 16 new 'impèriale fermée' (covered bilevel cars) gas-lit cars, and <b>heated</b> all <b>wagons</b> from winter of 1891. That year, the Ceinture Syndicate park was 24 single-level first-class cars, 77 second-class cars, 1 class-mixed car (impèriale fermée), and 51 wagons used for baggage and freight. The open-second-level cars had been {{the cause of a}} few under-tunnel-and-bridge deaths and a few suicides over the years, and, under pressure from the state, began to replace them progressively with new single-level cars,profiting also from the occasion to replace Ouest material (that they were still using since the Ceinture Syndicate merger) with cars owned by the Syndicate itself. By 1897, {{there were only a few}} open-top-deck cars in circulation.|$|R
5000|$|Group D had {{a special}} role within the Betriebswerk and not every depot had such a department. Smaller Betriebswerke {{allocated}} these tasks to a master tradesman's gang in group C, that had a maximum of 40 staff. Both the DB and the DR during the 1950s established larger D groups at independent locations, known as Betriebswagenwerke or wagon depots. Where {{this was not the}} case, Group D was headed by another inspector to whom, {{depending on the size of}} the depot, up to three wagon foremen (Wagenmeister) reported. This group was responsible for checking reports of damage, repairing damage and defects, supervising the shunting foremen at stations, clearing up operational irregularities, refilling gas and disinfection facilities for wagons, cleaning, lighting and <b>heating</b> of <b>wagons,</b> maintenance and repair jobs, dispatching wagons to the main repair shops, ordering spare parts and materials for wagons, including the management of the spare parts and monitoring new systems on wagons.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s 107 {{items of}} SM30 class {{locomotives}} were modified to <b>heat</b> old passenger <b>wagons,</b> which were modernized with 500V electric heaters, {{and as a}} result their designation was changed to SP30 (meaning a diesel locomotive able to pull passenger trains). A prototype locomotive, SM30-232 was converted in 1970. Then, in 1974-1977, 106 locomotives were converted this way by the ZNTK Nowy Sącz (of those, 75 in 1974). They retained their original SM30 class numbers. Those machines remained in regular service until the late 1980s. Because of a withdrawal of old wagons, in 2000 all of them were again, after dismounting heating systems, returned to SM30 series. A similar modification was applied to SM42 class, resulting in the SU42 class.|$|R
6000|$|Lying there, still awake, he {{reflected}} that he wouldn't be a scout when he grew up, {{but would be}} something like Mr. Peyton, and have a train like this, and invite the Silsbees and Susy to accompany him. For this purpose, he and Susy, early to-morrow morning, would get permission {{to come in here}} and play at that game. This would familiarize him with the details, so that he would be able at any time to take charge of it. He was already an authority on the subject of Indians! He had once been fired at--as an Indian. He would always carry a rifle like that hanging from the hooks at the end of the wagon before him, and would eventually slay many Indians and keep an account of them in a big book like that on the desk. Susy would help him, having grown up a lady, and they would both together issue provisions and rations from the door of the wagon to the gathered crowds. He would be known as the [...] "White Chief," [...] his Indian name being [...] "Suthin of a Pup." [...] He would have a circus van attached to the train, in which he would occasionally perform. He would also have artillery for protection. There would be a terrific engagement, and he would rush into the <b>wagon,</b> <b>heated</b> and blackened with gunpowder; and Susy would put down an account of it in a book, and Mrs. Peyton--for she would be there in some vague capacity--would say, [...] "Really, now, I don't see but what we were very lucky in having such a boy as Clarence with us. I begin to understand him better." [...] And Harry, who, for purposes of vague poetical retaliation, would also drop in at that moment, would mutter and say, [...] "He is certainly the son of Colonel Brant; dear me!" [...] and apologize. And his mother would come in also, in her coldest and most indifferent manner, in a white ball dress, and start and say, [...] "Good gracious, how that boy has grown! I am sorry I did not see more of him when he was young." [...] Yet even in the midst of this came a confusing numbness, and then the side of the wagon seemed to melt away, and he drifted out again alone into the empty desolate plain from which even the sleeping Susy had vanished, and he was left deserted and forgotten. Then all was quiet in the wagon, and only the night wind moving round it. But lo! the lashes of the sleeping White Chief--the dauntless leader, the ruthless destroyer of Indians--were wet with glittering tears! ...|$|R
