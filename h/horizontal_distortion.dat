Experimental results of this method are also compared with those of filtering without selecting regions. This comparison shows that the MSE is reduced and edges are better preserved for the proposed method. 1...|$|E
40|$|It {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} performances in the television receivers to reproduce a picture faithfully from the broadcasting signal. Usually, in the direct view type television receiver, there exists a problem that an original picture is distorted by the change of the horizontal width.

Many circuits have been proposed to improve this problem. However in the conventional circuit, the <b>horizontal</b> width <b>distortion</b> seems to be not always improved sufficiently.

40|$|Underground {{structures}} {{perform an}} important role in transportation systems in many seismically active regions around the world, but empirical data regarding the seismic behavior of these structures is limited. This research works towards filling that empirical gap through the use of scale model shake table testing. Underground seismic soil-structure interaction (USSSI) effects were investigated for a stiff rectangular tunnel cross-section embedded within soft clay. San Francisco Young Bay Mud was used as a prototype soil for developing a scale model soil mixture consisting of kaolinite, bentonite, class C fly ash, and water. A single cell Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) cut-and-cover subway tunnel was used as the prototype for the 10 th scale model subway cross-section. A flexible walled test container originally developed for a pile study at UC Berkeley was modified for use at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo. The flexible container allows for close approximation of one-dimensional (1 D) free-field site response by significantly limiting the rigidity of the boundary conditions and allowing the soil to deform under simple shear. The study was conducted over two shake table testing phases: Phase I consisted of shaking a model soil column to evaluate the ability of the test container to produce adequate 1 D free-field site response, and Phase II tests explored the <b>horizontal</b> racking <b>distortion</b> of a shallow rectangular tunnel cross-section subjected to strong transverse ground shaking. Phase I test results and comparison with SHAKE models indicate that the test container can sufficiently mimic 1 D free-field conditions, specifically for the primary shear deformation mode. Similarly, the equivalent linear soil-structure interaction code FLUSH was found to adequately model site response for the Phase II soil-structure system. Comparison of recorded <b>horizontal</b> racking <b>distortions</b> of the model structure with those from numerical modeling suggest that current simplified design methods may overestimate distortions to some degree for cases similar to those examined in this research. Overall, the flexible wall testing container shows promise as a viable means for gaining further insight into USSSI topics, as well as various other geotechnical and soil-structure interaction problems...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{three-dimensional}} finite-element model (FEM) of the human orbit, containing the globe, to predict orbital deformation in subjects following a blunt injury. This study investigated the hypothesis that such deformation could be modelled using finite-element techniques. One patient who had CT-scan examination to the maxillofacial skeleton including the orbits, as part of her treatment, was selected for this study. A FEM of one of the orbits containing the globe was constructed, based on CT-scan images. Simulations were performed with a computer using the finite-element software NISA (EMRC, Troy, USA). The orbit was subjected to a blunt injury of a 0. 5  kg missile with 30  m s− 1 velocity. The FEM was then used to predict principal and shear stresses or strains at each node position. Two types of orbital deformation were predicted during different impact simulations: (i) <b>horizontal</b> <b>distortion</b> and (ii) rotational distortion. Stress values ranged from 213. 4 to 363. 3  MPa for the maximum principal stress, from − 327. 8 to − 653. 1  MPa for the minimum principal stress, and from 212. 3 to 444. 3  MPa for the maximum shear stress. This is the first finite-element study, which demonstrates different and concurrent patterns of orbital deformation in a subject following a blunt injury.

40|$|International audienceWe analyse the 3 -D {{propagation}} of wind-forced near-inertial motions in a fully turbulent mesoscale eddy {{field with a}} primitive-equation numerical model. Although the wind-stress is uniform, the near-inertial motion field quickly becomes spatially heterogeneous, involving horizontal scales {{much smaller than the}} eddy scales. Analysis confirms that refraction by the eddy relative vorticity is the main mechanism responsible for the <b>horizontal</b> <b>distortion</b> of the near-inertial motions, which subsequently triggers their vertical propagation. An important result is the appearance of two maxima of near-inertial vertical velocity (both with r. m. s. values reaching 40 m/day) : one at a depth of 100 m and another unexpected one much below the main thermocline around 1700 m. The shallow maximum, captured by the highest vertical normal modes, involves near-inertial motions with a spatial heterogeneity close to the eddy vorticity gradient field. These characteristics match analytical results obtained with Young and Ben Jelloul (1997) 's approach. The deep maximum, captured by the lowest vertical normal modes, involves superinertial motions with a frequency of twice the inertial frequency and much smaller horizontal scales. Because of these characteristics, not anticipated by previous analytical studies, these superinertial motions may represent an energy source for small-scale mixing through a mechanism not taken into account in the present study: the parametric subharmonic instability (PSI). This reveals a pathway by which wind energy may {{have a significant impact on}} small-scale mixing in the deep interior. Further studies that explicitly take into account PSI are needed to estimate this potential impact...|$|E

To satisfy the requirements for beam-position stability, the orbit measurement system has been further developed. The test stage is nearly finished and the new system will be installed soon.

40|$|A {{method is}} {{proposed}} for analyzing an almost monochromatic train of waves propagating {{in a single}} direction in an inhomogeneous medium that is not otherwise changing in time. An effective phase is {{defined in terms of}} the Hilbert transform of the wave function, which is related, via the JWKB approximation, to the spatial variation of the background state against which the wave is propagating. The contaminating effect of interference between the truly monochromatic components of the train is eliminated using its propagation properties. Measurement errors, provided they are uncorrelated, are manifest as rapidly varying noise; although that noise can dominate the raw phase-processed signal, it can largely be removed by low-pass filtering. The intended purpose of the analysis is to determine the distortion of solar oscillations induced by horizontal structural variation and material flow. It should be possible to apply the method directly to sectoral modes. The <b>horizontal</b> phase <b>distortion</b> provides a measure of longitudinally averaged properties of the Sun {{in the vicinity of the}} equator, averaged also in radius down to the depth to which the modes penetrate. By combining such averages from different modes, the two-dimensional variation can be inferred by standard inversion techniques. After taking due account of horizontal refraction, it should be possible to apply the technique also to locally sectoral modes that propagate obliquely to the equator and thereby build a network of lateral averages at each radius, from which the full three-dimensional structure of the Sun can, in principle, be determined as an inverse Radon transform...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{focusing}} on the building damage parameters monitoring techniques and the validation of the current damage prediction methodology on building response next to deep excavations. Settlement risk assessments were done in Delft tunnel project to define and control the risk of damaging the adjacent buildings to the tunnel by following the LTSM methodology steps. Deformations were predicted for every building according to the allowable building damage category and limits were set for every execution phase. Prisms were installed on the buildings facades and these were targeted by robotic total stations hourly, so the horizontal and vertical deformations of the buildings facades were monitored during the execution. Limits were set then on horizontal/vertical displacements per execution phase by assuming that the building actual performance {{would be similar to}} the predicted one in the deformation models so the damage criteria of <b>horizontal</b> strain-angular <b>distortion</b> were transformed into horizontal-vertical displacements of a façade prism. The actual damage parameters calculation of <b>horizontal</b> strain/angular <b>distortion</b> per execution phase through a spreadsheet showed that the façade prism cannot be representative for the whole facade as the actual façade status in Boscardin and Cording (1989) graph was in different position than it should be. Moreover, the side walls are more susceptible to damage than the façade as it was seen in the Westvest 5 a building. A total station should be used to monitor building deformations but with monitoring points (prisms) installed at all visible building walls and measured during the execution works so the damage parameters to be properly calculated. Thus the actual building status (performance) can be accurately presented and directly compared with the predefined deformations limits (criteria) at every execution phase. For the calculation of façade’s horizontal strain, backside prisms should be used or the one at the most distance to the façade of the side walls. Plus, a bed joint measurement at major execution phases would indicate the critical hogging/sagging areas of the side walls. In case of excessive deformations, a flexible/weak building will tend to follow the greenfield deformations and there will be possible damages on the walls due to differential settlements but the stiff/strong building will rotate and move as a rigid body so no damages expected to be seen. Attention should be given on the free standing buildings, the ones with no buildings next to them as it seems that these are free to move parallel to the building pit and this movement can lead to greater values on the critical damage parameters. Limiting Tensile Strain Method is a practical tool to predict building deformations, conservative most of the times but quite reliable. In cases where special execution techniques are applied or there are critical buildings adjacent to deep excavations then special calculations methods should be used where all available data (building-soil conditions-execution) are imported into sophisticated finite element models (2 D- 3 D) for accurate deformations prediction. At the last step of LTSM, the building is categorized in a damage class and allowable deformations limits are set in Boscardin and Cording (1989) graph (criteria). The actual building status then can be controlled during execution when the damage parameters of horizontal strain and angular distortion are monitored and consequently presented on the graph (performance). In general the damage criterion of Boscardin and Cording (1989) is relatively precise but in cases of excessive deformations it will probably over- / under- estimate the actual damage.

Methods: Seventeen young subjects had corneal topography measured 3 {{times a day}} (around 9 AM, 1 PM, and 5 PM) on 3 {{days of the week}} (Monday, Tuesday, and Friday). Corneal tangential and refractive power were analyzed. To investigate diurnal variation in corneal aberrations, the corneal height data were converted into corneal wavefront error and expressed as Zernike wavefront coefficients. Results: A significant diurnal change in corneal tangential power maps was found in 15 of the 17 subjects. This change typically consisted of a <b>horizontal</b> band of <b>distortion</b> in the superior and, to a lesser extent, inferior cornea, increasing throughout the day. Corneal refractive power showed small but significant diurnal changes occurring in the best fit sphere. Corneal wavefront error analysis revealed significant diurnal changes occurring in astigmatism 90 / 180 degrees and astigmatism 45 / 135 degrees. Two higher-order aberrations, primary vertical coma and trefoil along 30 degrees, also showed significant diurnal change. The combination of these 2 aberrations represents a "wavelike" distortion increasing throughout the day and returning to baseline the next morning. Conclusion: We have shown that significant diurnal change occurs in certain corneal aberrations. The changes appear to be related to forces from the eyelids on the anterior cornea. These findings may have important implications for customized refractive corrections and refractive error development...|$|R

In 2008, Dr. Ida Giovanna Rao, the new head of the Laurentian Librarys manuscript office, repeated Lodis study, and concluded that {{it is likely that the}} i is a correction of some earlier character (like an e), the change being made an extremely subtle one. Later the same year, it was discovered that under ultraviolet light, an e is clearly visible in the space, meaning that the passage must originally have referred to chrestianos, a Latin word which could be interpreted as the good, after the Greek word χρηστός (chrestos), meaning good, useful. [...] "I believe that in our passage of Tacitus the original reading Chrestianos is the true one" [...] says Professor Robert Renehan, stating that it was [...] "natural for a Roman to interpret the words and Christianus as the similarly-sounding χρηστός".

40|$|Stereoscopic terrain models, {{constructed}} from photographs, {{have been in}} use for more than 100 years. They {{formed the basis for}} compilation of contour lines in topographic maps. This is likely to continue in the era of digital technologies. So the investigation of metric features of a digital stereoscopic model is valuable for the modern photogrammetry. We should also note that the widely used automatic stereoscopic measurements will be always rationally integrated with visual human-assisted measurements. Investigations in this area are conducted at the Laboratory of Aerospace Methods of Lomonosov Moscow State University in two directions: study of the influence of discretization on the formation of stereoscopic model; and study of influence of different factors on the accuracy of stereoscopic model measurements. The first direction implies research of discrete stereomodel formation at micro-level, namely the investigation of the influence of images pixel structure on geometric properties of the stereomodel. The main method used here is the construction of graphic stereogramms for different positions of an image in relation to the pixel matrix and their stereoscopic observations for control. Experiments have shown that pixel discretization of images may lead to <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>distortion</b> of stereomodel’s points for up to 1 - 2 pixels.

40|$|The {{notion that}} {{forces from the}} eyelids can alter {{the shape of the}} cornea has been {{proposed}} for many years. In recent times, there has been a marked improvement in our ability to measure and define the corneal shape, allowing subtle changes in the cornea to be measured. These improvements have led to the findings that pressure from the eyelids can cause alterations in corneal shape following everyday visual tasks such as reading. There are also theories to suggest that pressure from the eyelids may be involved in the aetiology of corneal astigmatism. In this program of research, a series of experiments were undertaken to investigate the influence of the eyelids on the shape of the cornea. In the first experiment, an investigation into the diurnal variation of corneal shape was carried out by measuring corneal topography at three different times (approximately 9 am, 1 pm and 5 pm) during the day over three days of the week (Monday, Tuesday and Friday). Highly significant diurnal changes were found to occur in the corneal topography of 15 of the 17 subjects. This change typically consisted of <b>horizontal</b> bands of <b>distortion</b> in the superior, and to a lesser extent, inferior cornea, increasing throughout the day (and returning to baseline the next morning). These changes appeared to be related to forces from the eyelids on the anterior cornea. Some changes were also found in corneal astigmatism. Corneal astigmatism power vector J 0 (astigmatism 90 / 180 °) was found to increase slightly {{over the course of the}} week. Whilst the changes in astigmatism were small in magnitude, this result leaves open the possibility that pressure from the eyelid may cause changes in corneal astigmatism. If pressure from the eyelids is involved in the aetiology of corneal astigmatism, then one may expect associations to exist between certain characteristics of the eyelids and corneal shape. An experiment was then undertaken to explore these possible associations. We defined the average morphology of the palpebral fissure in different angles of vertical gaze for 100 young normal subjects. This was achieved through analysis of digital images that were captured in primary gaze, 20 ° downgaze and 40 ° downgaze. Parameters defining the size, position, angle and contour of the eyelids were determined. Highly significant changes were found to occur in the palpebral fissure with downward gaze. The palpebral aperture narrows in downward gaze, and the angle of the eyelids changes from being slightly upward slanted in primary gaze, to being slightly downward slanted in downward gaze. The eyelid margin contour also flattens significantly in downward gaze. The average topography of the central and peripheral cornea was also defined for this same population. A technique was used that allowed the capture and subsequent combination of topography data from both the central and the peripheral cornea. The use of this technique provided a large corneal topography map, with data extending close to the limbus for each subject. Marked flattening was found to occur in the peripheral cornea and a conic section was found to be a poor descriptor of corneal contour in the periphery (i. e. greater than 6 mm diameter). Corneal astigmatism was also found on average to reduce in the periphery. However a number of distinct patterns of peripheral corneal astigmatism were noted in the population. Corneal astigmatism in the peripheral cornea was either found to remain stable (59...|$|R
