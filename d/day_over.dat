The system was last noted the following <b>day</b> <b>over</b> Gujarat and moving into Pakistan.|$|E
5|$|Repetitive diving {{occurs when}} two dives are {{separated}} by a short surface interval, during which the diver has not completely outgassed from the first dive. The gas loading from the first dive must then {{be taken into account}} when determining no stop times and decompression requirements for the second dive. Multiple decompressions per <b>day</b> <b>over</b> multiple days can increase the risk of decompression sickness because of the buildup of asymptomatic bubbles, which reduce the rate of off-gassing and are not accounted for in most decompression algorithms.|$|E

5|$|The axial tilt of Neptune is 28.32°, {{which is}} similar to the tilts of Earth (23°) and Mars (25°). As a result, Neptune {{experiences}} similar seasonal changes to Earth. The long orbital period of Neptune means that the seasons last for forty Earth years. Its sidereal rotation period (day) is roughly 16.11hours. Because its axial tilt is comparable to Earth's, the variation in the length of its <b>day</b> <b>over</b> the course of its long year is not any more extreme.|$|E

According to the Ministry of Environmental Protection, as of April 2007 more than 50 new plants could treat 1.84million tonnes per day, 65% {{of the total}} need. About 32 landfills were added, which could handle 7,664.5tonnes of solid waste every <b>day.</b> <b>Over</b> onebillion tons of wastewater are released annually into the river, which {{was more likely to}} be swept away before the reservoir was created. This has left the water looking stagnant, polluted and murky.|$|E
5|$|An upper-low {{pressure}} system {{formed in the}} Gulf of Mexico on September6, with the circulation heading westward. Initially, minimal development occurred, though by September8, the system became a surface low. It is estimated that the surface low became a subtropical depression by 0000UTC on the following <b>day.</b> <b>Over</b> the next 24hours, the low began acquiring tropical characteristics, mainly from developing deep convection on its north and east sides. By early on September10, observations from oil rigs, radars, and Air Force reconnaissance flights indicated that the subtropical system had transitioned into Tropical Depression Four. However, the National Hurricane Center did not operationally issue advisories until 1900UTC on September10, at which time Chris was already a tropical storm.|$|E

5|$|As Delia {{neared the}} Texas coastline, it managed to intensify into a strong {{tropical}} storm with winds of 70mph (110km/h) and reconnaissance reported winds well {{in excess of}} hurricane-force in numerous squalls associated with the storm. The lowest pressure was recorded at 986mbar (hPa; 29.11inHg). However, Delia was not classified a hurricane as it had not developed an eyewall around the center of circulation. Delia subsequently made its first landfall at Freeport, Texas late on September4. After executing a counterclockwise loop, the storm made its second landfall in Freeport on September5. After moving inland, the storm quickly weakened, becoming a depression on September6 before dissipating early the next <b>day</b> <b>over</b> northern Mexico.|$|E
5|$|As Delta {{accelerated}} to {{the northeast}} towards the Canary Islands, it intensified again, reaching a second peak of just under hurricane strength on November27. In post-storm analysis, the NHC noted {{that there was a}} possibility that Delta had briefly reached hurricane strength that day; however, the data was not conclusive enough to justify an upgrade to hurricane status. On November28, as it neared the Canary Islands Tropical Storm Delta lost its tropical characteristics. The extratropical storm, which maintained winds of near-hurricane strength, passed about 105mi (165km) north of the islands that night. The storm moved over Morocco early on November29 and rapidly weakened overland, dissipating late that <b>day</b> <b>over</b> northwestern Algeria.|$|E

At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all <b>day</b> <b>over</b> roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way I went.|$|E

With his French connections he was in the following years a valuable diplomat in France for the English King. He also served as military commander in occupied Scotland. In 1298 at Blackearnside, a forest of alders, to the east of the village of Newburgh in Fife, he suffered an ignominious defeat from a force commanded by Wallace, Guardian of Scotland. In 1306 at the Battle of Methven, he won the <b>day</b> <b>over</b> Robert the Bruce only to be soundly defeated by Bruce at Loudoun Hill the next year.|$|E
5|$|In 1861 {{permission}} {{was granted}} to the Morayshire Railway to cross the Spey and join with the Strathspey Railway at Craigellachie. The Morayshire extension and the Strathspey both opened on 1 July 1863 and the Great North provided a service of four trains a <b>day</b> <b>over</b> the line, which gave an alternative route between Keith and Elgin. On 30 July 1866 permission {{was given to the}} Morayshire and Great North to amalgamate with agreement, and the loss-making services between Orton and Rothes were withdrawn without notice the following day. It would be August 1881 before the Morayshire became fully part of the Great North.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of November 8 a {{depression}} formed in the south-central Bay of Bengal. It moved very slowly to the north, becoming a cyclonic storm the next day. It continued to intensify as it approached {{the head of the}} Bay, becoming the third severe cyclonic storm of the season on November 11. That evening it reached its peak with winds of 185km/h (115mph) with a well-developed eye and became the strongest storm of the season. It then made landfall on the coast of East Pakistan during the night of November 12. The cyclone weakened rapidly as it moved inland and dissipated the next <b>day</b> <b>over</b> south Assam.|$|E

5|$|Rumors that PortAventura {{would be}} {{investing}} in a new Bolliger & Mabillard Flying Coaster or Dive Coaster roller coaster emerged in late 2010. In May 2011, speculation that the park was planning to build a hypercoaster that would pass over Dragon Khan arose. Land clearing also began {{in the summer of}} 2011. Shambhala was announced to the public on October 24, 2011; the layout of the roller coaster was leaked 2 days earlier. The last piece of track was installed in mid-April 2012 following a signing event and the placement of the several country flags on the track. Testing of the ride began in the same month. Following the completion of testing, a ribbon cutting ceremony was held on May 12, 2012 before opening to the public the same <b>day.</b> <b>Over</b> 300 workers from countries such as Germany, France, Hungary, Poland, Switzerland, and United States of America took part in the construction of Shambhala.|$|E
5|$|The 1909 Grand Isle {{hurricane}} was a {{large and}} deadly Category3 hurricane that caused severe damage and killed more than 400 people throughout Cuba and the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico. Forming out of a tropical disturbance just south of Hispaniola on September13, 1909, the initial depression slowly intensified as it moved west-northwest towards Jamaica. Two days later, the system attained tropical storm intensity and turned northwestward towards Cuba. On September16, it attained {{the equivalent of a}} modern-day Category1 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale and further strengthened to attain winds of 100mph (155km/h) before making landfall in Pinar del Río Province, Cuba on September18. After a briefly weakening over land, the system regained strength over the Gulf of Mexico, with peak winds reaching 120mph (195km/h) the following day. After only slightly weakening, the hurricane increased in forward motion and made landfall near Grand Isle, Louisiana on September21. The system quickly lost strength after moving over land, dissipating the following <b>day</b> <b>over</b> Missouri.|$|E
5|$|The 1977 Oman cyclone was {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on record to strike Oman. The storm formed off {{the west coast}} of India in the Arabian Sea, and curved westward to reach peak winds of 110km/h (70mph). The storm struck Masirah Island and later southern Oman on June13, before dissipating the next <b>day</b> <b>over</b> Saudi Arabia. Producing wind gusts to 230km/h (140mph), the storm was the strongest cyclone on record to hit the Arabian Peninsula until Cyclone Gonu hit in 2007. About 95% of Marisah Island was damaged by the strong winds, including much of the military base. The cyclone dropped 430.6mm (16.95in) of rainfall over a 24period on Marisah, which was the highest daily total in the country as of 2003. Overall, the storm killed at least 105people and left 50,000 homeless.|$|E
