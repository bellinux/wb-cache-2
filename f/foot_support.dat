5000|$|Stirrups are {{supports}} for the rider's feet that hang down {{on either side}} of the saddle. They provide greater stability for the rider but can have safety concerns due to the potential for a rider's feet to get stuck in them. If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions are taken. First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth sole. Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow a stirrup leather to fall off the saddle if pulled backwards by a falling rider. Other precautions are done with stirrup design itself. Western saddles have wide stirrup treads that make it more difficult for the foot to become trapped. A number of saddle styles incorporate a tapedero, which is covering over the front of the stirrup that keeps the foot from sliding all the way through the stirrup. The English stirrup (or [...] "iron") has several design variations which are either shaped to allow the rider's foot to slip out easily or are closed with a very heavy rubber band. [...] The invention of stirrups was of great historic significance in mounted combat, giving the rider secure <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> while on horseback.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{movement}} coordination pattern between barefoot and minimal <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> footwear. Ten female participants participated in the study, and each participant walked on a treadmill barefoot and in minimal <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> (UGG) boots. The results showed no significant change in the timing and sequencing of the walking gait when minimal <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> footwear was worn. However, this study found that walking, a functional kinetic chain, activity does not follow the proximal to distal body segmental sequencing as in the open and closed kinetic chains. The knee joint initiates the walking motion first and then follows by the ankle and hip joints, so this study indicates the importance of strengthening knee joint in walking gait. Future studies are warranted to examine the long term effect of wearing minimal <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> footwear and other functional kinetic chain activities...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we seek control {{strategies}} for legged robots that produce resulting kinetics and kinematics {{that are both}} stable and biologically realistic. Recent biomechanical investigations have found that spin angular momentum is highly regulated in human standing, walking and running. Motivated by these biomechanical findings, we argue that biomimetic control schemes should explicitly control spin angular momentum, minimizing spin and CM torque contributions not only local in time but throughout movement tasks. Assuming a constant and zero spin angular momentum, we define the Zero Spin Center of Pressure (ZSCP) point. For human standing control, we show experimentally and by way of numerical simulation that as the ZSCP point moves across {{the edge of the}} <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> polygon, spin angular momentum control changes from regulation to non-regulation. However, even when the ZSCP moves beyond the <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> polygon, stability can be achieved through the generation of restoring CM forces that reestablish the CM position over the <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> polygon. These results are interesting because they suggest that different control strategies are utilized depending on the location of the ZSCP point relative to the <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> polygon...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Postural {{control is}} {{important}} for daily activities like reaching and sitting. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) form {{the largest group of}} children with disturbances in postural control. Two levels can be distinguished in postural control: 1) a basic level of direction-specificity, meaning that perturbations inducing a forward sway of the body are accompanied by primary muscle activity on the dorsal side of the body and vice versa and 2) fine-tuning of the direction-specific activity on the basis of afferent input. This pilot study explores the influence of different sitting positions on the stability of the head in space, the kinematic quality of reaching and EMG-parameters of postural control in school-aged children with CP. Methods: Four children aged 8 - 12 years, GMFCS level I-II with unilateral or bilateral spastic CP participated in the study. They were assessed during reaching in four different sitting positions: horizontal seat surface with and without <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> and tilted forward 15 ° with and without <b>foot</b> <b>support.</b> Postural control was measured using surface EMGs of arm, neck, trunk and leg muscles. Movements were recorded kinematically using the SIMI Motion System. Data analysis was carried out with the PedEMG program and the SIMI Motion 3 D program. Data were interpreted by ‘eye balling’ graphs of the effect of sitting condition of the individual children. Results: Overall, posture and reaching of the children with CP was characterized by variation. The data suggested that in the conditions without <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> a forward tilted seat surface in comparison to the horizontal situation was associated with a better quality of reaching and an inconsistent effect on head stability and postural muscle activity. In the horizontal position addition of <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> seemed to be associated with an inconsistent effect on head stability, but a better quality of reaching, and better postural muscle activity. However, <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> in the forward tilted condition seemed not to be associated with improved head stability, reaching and posture. Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study indicate that in the situation of the absence of <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> forward tilting of the seat surface may be associated with a better quality of reaching without affecting postural control. Also the addition of <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> in the horizontal position may {{have a positive effect on}} the quality of reaching without a consistent positive effect on posture. A similar positive effect of <b>foot</b> <b>support</b> seemed absent in the forward tilted position. Further research with larger groups is needed for scientific evidence on the effect of the various sitting conditions on reaching and posture of children with CP. ...|$|E
