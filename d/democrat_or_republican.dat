[...] Former New Mexico Republican Senator Pete Domenici thought Gore's prominence on the global warming issue made it more difficult to get a consensus in Congress.

2500|$|The {{national}} visibility Cisneros gained {{as mayor}} of San Antonio led to President Ronald Reagan appointing him in 1983 to the Bipartisan Commission on Central America, chaired by Henry Kissinger. In 1984, Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale tapped Cisneros as {{a finalist for the}} vice presidential nomination, which eventually went to U.S. Rep. Geraldine Ferraro. [...] Cisneros was selected to give the highly visible “Platform Presentation” at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco on July 17, 1984. [...] His viability as a national leader was confirmed in 1985 when Cisneros was elected president of the National League of Cities. [...] In 1986, City and State Magazine selected him as the “Outstanding Mayor” in the nation. [...] A scholarly study of America’s mayors, The American Mayor, ranked Cisneros as one of the 15 best mayors in the nation in a period that spanned the 20th century. [...] He was consistently touted as senatorial and/or gubernatorial material throughout his tenure as mayor, and was identified positively by both conservatives and liberals. [...] In Señor Alcalde ("Mr. Mayor"), John Gillies wrote: [...] "He tried to avoid a political label, such as <b>Democrat</b> <b>or</b> <b>Republican,</b> because he wanted to consider the needs of all of San Antonio's groupings.... He formed a bridge between conservatives and liberals..." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{prevailing}} {{system of}} education, {{which we have}} inherited from the past, largely fails to accomplish this. In the first place, it has been authoritative rather than scientific, {{which is to say}} that students have been induced to accept the statements of teachers and text books, and have not been trained to weigh for themselves their reasonableness and worth; a principle essentially unscientific and undemocratic, since it inculcates in the future citizen convictions rather than encourages the habit of open-mindedness so necessary for democratic citizenship. For democracy--it cannot be too often repeated--is a dynamic thing, experimental, creative in its very essence. No static set of opinions can apply to the constantly changing aspect of affairs. New discoveries, which come upon us with such bewildering rapidity, are apt abruptly to alter social and industrial conditions, while morals and conventions are no longer absolute. Sudden crises threaten the stability of nations and civilizations. Safety lies alone in the ability to go forward, to progress. Psychology teaches us that if authoritative opinions, convictions, or [...] "complexes" [...] are stamped upon the plastic brain of the youth they tend to harden, and he is apt to become a <b>Democrat</b> <b>or</b> <b>Republican,</b> an Episcopalian or a Baptist, a free trader or a tariff advocate or a Manchester economist without asking why. Such [...] "complexes" [...] were probably referred to by the celebrated physician who emphasized the hopelessness of most individuals over forty. And every reformer and forum lecturer knows how difficult it is to convert the average audience of seasoned adults to a new idea: he finds the most responsive groups in the universities and colleges. It is significant that the [...] "educated" [...] adult audiences in clubs and prosperous churches are the least open to conversion, because, in the scientific sense, the [...] "educated" [...] classes retain complexes, and hence are the least prepared to cope with the world as it is today. The German system, which has been bent upon installing authoritative conviction instead of encouraging freedom of thought, should be a warning to us.|$|E

By perspective we mean a point of view, for example, {{from the perspective of}} <b>Democrats</b> <b>or</b> <b>Republicans.</b> Can computers learn to identify the perspective of a document?

We develop statistical models to capture how perspectives are expressed at the document and sentence levels, and evaluate the proposed models on a collection of articles on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The results show that the statistical models can successfully learn how perspectives are reflected in word usage and identify the perspective of a document with very high accuracy. ...|$|R
