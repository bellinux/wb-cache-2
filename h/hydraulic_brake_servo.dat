5000|$|The G4 was a {{development}} of the G1, launched in 1926. All had an 8-cylinder inline engine, {{in the first three}} years of 5018 cc (306.2 cu in) displacement delivering [...] It was a 6x4 configuration with four-speed transmission (synchronised upper gears) that transferred drive to all four rear wheels via self-locking differentials, the front wheels did not drive. The rear wheels were attached to two rigid axles 950 mm apart, which were suspended in joint semi-elliptic leaf springs. The front axle was rigid with semi-elliptic springs. All six wheels had <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> with <b>servo</b> assistance. The top speed was only 67 km/h, limited by the type of all-terrain tyres. Only 11 of these vehicles were delivered to the Wehrmacht. The car used an elongated box-section frame that allowed for generous interior room. Comfortable seating for up to seven was provided by benches (front and rear) and one middle row of two with separate arm rests.The vehicles were first delivered to the SS for use by Hitler and his adjutants painted with gloss gray bodies over gloss black fenders and running boards but, by the end of the war, they had all received anti-reflective matte and/or camouflage finishes in accordance with their military purpose. Many G4 vehicles belonging to the highest-ranking party members also featured rear-facing spotlights to be used to temporarily blind unauthorized drivers who followed too closely.|$|R
50|$|A {{brake booster}} {{is used on}} {{virtually}} all vehicles which use <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brakes</b> for their primary <b>braking</b> circuit. Vacuum <b>servos</b> are not used on vehicles which use cables, rods (or other mechanical linkages), or pressurized air systems for their primary brake circuits.|$|R
50|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> {{dual circuit}} <b>brake</b> {{system with a}} <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> is used. The front wheels have disc brakes, that are - except for the 518i - {{internally}} ventilated. All models with 2.4 l displacement or less have rear drum brakes, while all models with 2.5nbsp;l or more displacement have non internally ventilated rear disc brakes. To prevent the wheels from blocking, BMW equipped the E28 with an anti-lock braking system, although it was an option in some markets.|$|R

40|$|Abstractï¼šThe {{full power}} <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system has several {{advantages}} over traditional brake actuation systems. These systems {{are capable of}} supplying fluid {{to a range of}} very small and large volume service brakes with actuation that is faster than air/hydraulic brake systems. Implementation of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system in off-road vehicles calls for good understanding of its dynamic characteristics. In this paper, we consider the problem of dynamic modeling of the brake system and develop a dynamic model for a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> valve. First, the dynamic characteristics of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system are analyzed theoretically. The effects of varying design parameters (brake valve, accumulator and so on) and the different operating conditions are then analyzed. Second, we investigate the dynamic characteristics of a full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system using a test bench, which is a loader brake system specifically designed for one construction Machinery Company. Finally, based on the experimental results, the mathematical models are amended and verified. The result shows that the model-calculated data agree well with tested data. The dynamic behavior of hydraulic valve can be well predicted with the model. The simplified models {{can be applied to the}} studies of full power <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> system dynamics...|$|R

40|$|Abstract- The bogie of {{monorail}} vehicles applies {{rubber wheel}} system not steel wheel system. In addition, The {{structure of the}} bogie is very complicated because vehicle operates on the elevated road and vehicle drives with wrapping the guide way. When the monorail vehicle applies air brake system, lower device of vehicle may be complex and some devices may be limited. On the other hand, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> equipment is compact and not weighing. Braking force is also outstanding compared with air <b>brake</b> so the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>brake</b> equipment is suitable for monorail vehicle. Also urban transit system such as monorail, applies mixed system both friction brake and electric brake {{in order to save}} electric energy.

5000|$|The {{suspension}} set-up was unchanged {{from that}} on the Taunus TC (as improved in September 1973). The twin circuit <b>hydraulic</b> <b>braking</b> system still operated on disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the rear, their diameters unchanged. However, where in 1970 a buyer of the entry level 1294 cc would have found a <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> only on the options list, servo-assisted brakes for the Taunus TC2 were standard across the range. On the six-cylinder cars, which had heavier engine blocks, it also became possible from August 1977 to specify as an option power assisted steering. [...] The range of engine sizes was the same apart from one important addition: buyers could specify an enlarged 1993 cc version of the [...] "Pinto" [...] OHC engine. It was therefore now possible to buy a 2-litre Taunus with either 4 or 6 cylinders. The four-cylinder powered car came with an advertised maximum output of [...] while the six-cylinder version offered only [...] The more recently designed four-cylinder unit also came with more torque. Nevertheless, the six-cylinder car achieved its maxima at lower engine speeds and some commentators found it more relaxing to drive.|$|R
