After Bennett left for home, Mendelssohn wrote to their mutual friend, the English organist and composer Thomas Attwood, [...] "I think him the most promising young musician I know, not only in your country but also <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am convinced if he does not become a very great musician, it is not God's will, but his own".|$|E

I was brand new <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> wasn’t happy with the way that turned out, and it came back in about 5 or 6 episodes.

Bosh was active on the social media front, posting his thoughts on Twitter and having a documentary crew record his meetings with the teams interested in signing him. On July 10, 2010, Bosh officially completed a sign-and-trade deal with the Miami Heat, teaming up with Wade and James. Bosh's parting message to the Raptors on his website said, [...] "now that this was my toughest decision, mostly because Toronto has been so great to me. I've loved every minute <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> just {{wanted to thank you}} {{from the bottom of my}} heart..." [...] Not only did Bosh leave Toronto as its all-time leader in virtually all major statistical categories, he was one of only three players in the league who accrued 10,000 points, 4,500 rebounds, and 600 blocks in his seven seasons with the Raptors.|$|E

[...] Sushi-X of Electronic Gaming Monthly (EGM) called it [...] "a great translation considering its limitations," [...] 5 (November 1994), page 37. although a reviewer for The Detroit News felt [...] "very disappointed" [...] with this port and recommended the SNES version instead, which C+VG declared [...] "the most perfect coin-op conversion ever." [...] The four reviewers of EGM hailed the SNES version as a [...] "near-perfect" [...] translation of the arcade game. While commenting that its graphics and sounds are {{not as good as}} those of the SNES version, they held the Genesis version to be an outstanding port as well. A reviewer for The Baltimore Sun called the SNES version [...] "the best game I've ever played - a true translation," [...] while Patterson noted it was the bloodiest game Nintendo has yet allowed to be released.|$|E
500|$|Before All My Children {{offered him}} {{the role of}} Dimitri Marick, Nader already planned on working in both Los Angeles and New York.

[...] "She had an apartment <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> had been seeking out some theater here in New York {{and would have been}} spending time both here and in L.A. So after we made the decision to go ahead with that game plan, this offer (Dimitri) came on the table and when we worked out all the figures moneywise it was a great opportunity." [...] Despite Nader's prime time success as Dynasty's Dex Dexter, he did not look down on daytime television. [...] "The {{fact of the matter is}} we're in a different era," [...] he said. [...] "And if you look at the cutbacks in Hollywood, being on a soap is not of any less or more value than being in any other medium at this time." [...] Another factor that contributed to his decision to join All My Children was the actors strike. He intended to stay on All My Children for a year. That year turned into more because the actor fell in love with New York.|$|E

500|$|During the follow pre-season, Holdsworth allowed Nix {{to attend}} a trial with Dutch Eerste Divisie side Sparta Rotterdam. Nix {{described}} it as a [...] "chance of a lifetime" [...] to pursue his dream of playing for the Australian national side with Sparta having an Australian coach. However, his trial was unsuccessful and he returned to Mansfield and he immediately scored in a friendly ahead of the new Conference season. Nix was not included in Mansfield's squad for the first three games of the season, and during the third match with the side losing, the club's fans were singing Nix's name. After eventually winning 3–1, Holdsworth said: [...] "I know Kyle is a very good player and I respect the fans have individuals they like. But we have a healthy squad <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> picked what I felt was a winning side today which proved to be right." [...] His first game of the season was as a late substitute for Adam Smith moments after Mansfield conceded an equaliser in a 1–1 draw with Kettering Town. His first start of the season came as Holdsworth made changes to personnel and formation for a game at Southport on 11 September. A 2–1 victory was Mansfield's third consecutive win. Before the end of the month, he had scored his first goal of the month, during a 5–0 victory against York City which put Mansfield second in the table.|$|E

On his return to Accrington he commented; [...] "I am back here because I feel I have unfinished business. I played well for a year <b>here</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> {{want to do the}} same again". He had played 10 games in League Two and one game in the League Cup failing to score, and picking up a red card for violent conduct after a stamp on Peterborough United winger Jamie Day in their 2–0 home loss on 1 September. However, McEvilly struggled to hold down a regular place in the Accrington side and was loaned out to former club, Rochdale in November 2007. On his return to Spotland Stadium, he scored the only goal of Rochdale's 1–0 win over Mansfield Town on 24 November, with a shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area. McEvilly made a total of seven appearances for Rochdale scoring three goals, before returning in January 2008. He made one more appearance for Accrington, coming on as a substitute in the 73rd minute for Paul Mullin in the 2–0 defeat to Stockport County on 12 January, before joining Cambridge United on loan on 18 January. McEvilly made 14 appearances and scored three goals for Cambridge, helping them finish second place in the 2007–08 Conference National, securing a place in the playoffs. In Cambridge's playoff semi-final first leg, they drew 2–2 with Burton Albion away at the Pirelli Stadium with McEvilly scoring both Cambridge's goals. Cambridge were 2–0 down and McEvilly came on as a substitute for Mark Beesley in the 74th minute. Paul Hurst was deemed to have handled in the penalty area, and four minutes later McEvilly converted the penalty four minutes after coming off the bench. He scored his second goal from a direct free kick. In the following leg, McEvilly started the game and had a shot within the opening 30 seconds which Rob Wolleaston managed to score from the rebound, before being replaced by Leo Fortune-West in the 77th minute. McEvilly played in the final, in which Exeter City defeated Cambridge 1–0 at Wembley Stadium.|$|E
