50|$|Copper tubing conducts {{heat away}} {{much faster than}} a {{conventional}} hand-held soldering iron or gun can provide, so a propane torch is most commonly used to deliver the necessary power; for large tubing sizes and fittings a MAPP-fueled, acetylene-fueled, or propylene-fueled torch is used with atmospheric air as the oxidizer; MAPP/oxygen or acetylene/oxygen are rarely used because the flame temperature {{is much higher than}} the melting point of copper. Too much heat destroys the temper of hard-tempered copper tubing, and can burn the flux out of a joint before the solder is added, resulting in a <b>faulty</b> <b>joint.</b> For larger tubing sizes, a torch fitted with various sizes of interchangeable swirl tips is employed to deliver the needed heating power. In the hands of a skilled tradesman, the hotter flame of acetylene, MAPP, or propylene allows more joints to be completed per hour without damage to copper tempering.|$|E

50|$|In an {{improper}} installation, the overcurrent from a short circuit may cause ohmic heating of the circuit parts with poor conductivity (<b>faulty</b> <b>joints</b> in wiring, <b>faulty</b> contacts in power sockets, {{or even the}} site of the short circuit itself). Such overheating is a common cause of fires. An electric arc, if it forms during the short circuit, produces high amount of heat and can cause ignition of combustible substances as well.|$|R
50|$|In woodwind {{instrument}} repair, a {{smoke test}} involves plugging {{one end of}} an instrument and blowing smoke into the other to test for leaks. Escaping smoke reveals improperly seated pads and <b>faulty</b> <b>joints</b> (i.e. leaks). After this test the instrument is cleaned to remove nicotine and other deposits left by the smoke. Due to tobacco smoke being used, this test may be hazardous {{to the health of}} the technician in the long run.|$|R
40|$|When an {{assistant}} robotic manipulator cooperatively performs a task {{with a human}} and the task is required to be highly reliable, then fault tolerance is essential. To achieve the fault tolerance force within the human robot cooperation, it is required to map {{the effects of the}} <b>faulty</b> <b>joint</b> of the robot into the manipulator’s healthy joints’ torque space and the human force. The objective is to optimally maintain the cooperative force within the human robot cooperation. This paper aims to analyze the fault tolerant force within the cooperation and two frameworks are proposed. Then they have been validated through a fault scenario. Finally, the minimum force jump which is the optimal fault tolerance has been achieved...|$|E
40|$|Autonomous or {{teleoperation}} {{of critical}} tasks in space applications require fault tolerant robotic manipulators. These manipulators {{are able to}} maintain their tasks even if a joint fails. If it is presumed that the manipulator is fault tolerant on its trajectory, then {{the next step is}} to provide a fault tolerant force at the end-effector of the manipulator. The problem of cooperative fault tolerant force is addressed in this paper within the operation of two manipulators. The cooperative manipulators are used to compensate the force jump which occurs on the force of the end-effector of one manipulator due to a joint failure. To achieve fault tolerant operation, the contribution of the <b>faulty</b> <b>joint</b> for the force of the end-effector of the faulty manipulator is required to be optimally mapped into the torque of the faulty and healthy manipulators. The optimal joint torque reconfigurations of both manipulators for compensating this force jump are illustrated. The proposed frameworks are deployed for two cooperative PUMA 560 manipulators. The results of the case studies validate the fault tolerant cooperation strategies...|$|E
50|$|Roller {{printing}} {{was highly}} productive, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a single-colour machine. It is capable of reproducing every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving to the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing with repeats from 1 in to 80 inches. It is precise, so each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place without <b>faulty</b> <b>joints</b> at the points of repetition.|$|R
25|$|The {{advantages}} {{possessed by}} roller printing over all other processes are mainly three: firstly, its high productivity, 10,000 to 12,000 yards being commonly printed {{in one day}} of ten hours by a single-colour machine; secondly, by its capacity of being applied to the reproduction of every style of design, ranging from the fine delicate lines of copperplate engraving and the small repeats and limited colours of the perrotine to the broadest effects of block printing and to patterns varying in repeat from I to 80 in.; and thirdly, the wonderful exactitude with which each portion of an elaborate multicolour pattern can be fitted into its proper place, and the entire absence of <b>faulty</b> <b>joints</b> at its points of repeat or repetition consideration {{of the utmost importance}} in fine delicate work, where such a blur would utterly destroy the effect.|$|R
40|$|Fault {{tolerant}} manipulators {{maintain their}} trajectory {{even if their}} joint/s fails. Assuming that the manipulator is fault tolerant on its trajectory, fault tolerant compliance manipulators provide required force at their end-effector even when a joint fails. To achieve this, {{the contributions of the}} <b>faulty</b> <b>joints</b> for the force of the end-effector are required to be mapped into the proper compensating joint torques of the healthy joints to maintain the force. This paper addresses the optimal mapping to minimize the force jump due to a fault, which is the maximum effort to maintain the force when a fault occurs. The paper studies the locked joint fault/s of the redundant manipulators and it relates the force jump at the end-effector to the faults within the joints. Adding on a previous study to maintain the trajectory, in here the objective is to providing fault tolerant force at the end-effector of the redundant manipulators. This optimal mapping with minimum force jump is presented using matrix perturbation model. And the force jump is calculated through this model for single and multiple joints fault. The proposed optimal mapping is used in different fault scenarios for a 5 -DOF manipulator; also it is deployed to compensate the force at the end-effector for the 5 -DOF manipulator through simulation study and the results are presented...|$|R
30|$|Corrosion {{damage of}} bridge beam/girder ends {{is a major}} common problem and the {{rehabilitation}} of beam ends has become of increased interest to transportation agencies. One of the leading contributors to beam end failure is the leakage of water through <b>faulty</b> expansion <b>joints.</b> This leakage causes spalling of the concrete and ultimately leads to corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Joint preservation {{is an important component}} in extending the life of beam ends (Ahlborn et al. 2002; Basheer et al. 1997). In addition, beam end protection and treatments can be applied to enhance service life of girders.|$|R
50|$|According to a press {{representative}} of Kubs, the architect bureau that designed the building, the possibly <b>faulty</b> metal <b>joint</b> components were supplied by Vikom Industry. The management at Vikom Industry {{had said that}} they were unable to provide single-piece components and offered components that would be assembled out of two halves, but which would be just as strong as the ones ordered. Therefore, according to Kubs, Vikom Industry is solely responsible for the component and bolt force and strength calculations. Vladislavs Podgurskis, a {{representative of}} Vikom Industry, said in response that all metal components were made and assembled strictly according to the building design and that it must be a design error.|$|R
40|$|Since 2008 {{scientists}} have conducted experiments in a hyperenergized, 17 -mile supercollider beneath {{the border of}} France and Switzerland. The Large Hadron Collider (or what scientists call "the LHC") {{is one of the}} wonders of the modern world—a highly sophisticated scientific instrument designed to recreate in miniature the conditions of the universe as they existed in the microseconds following the big bang. Among many notable LHC discoveries, one led to the 2013 Nobel Prize in Physics for revealing evidence of the existence of the Higgs boson, the so-called God particle. Picking up where he left off in The Quantum Frontier, physicist Don Lincoln shares an insider’s account of the LHC’s operational history and gives readers everything they need to become well informed on this marvel of technology. Writing about the LHC’s early days, Lincoln offers keen insight into an accident that derailed the operation nine days after the collider’s 2008 debut. A <b>faulty</b> solder <b>joint</b> started a chain reaction that caused a massive explosion, damaged 50 superconducting magnets, and vaporized large sections of the conductor. The crippled LHC lay dormant for over a year, while technical teams repaired the damage. Lincoln devotes an entire chapter to the Higgs boson and Higgs field, using several extended analogies to help explain the importance of these concepts to particle physics. In the final chapter, he describes what the discovery of the Higgs boson tells us about our current understanding of basic physics and how the discovery now keeps scientists awake over a nagging inconsistency in their favorite theory. As accessible as it is fascinating, The Large Hadron Collider reveals the inner workings of this masterful achievement of technology, along with the mind-blowing discoveries that will keep it {{at the center of the}} scientific frontier for the foreseeable future...|$|R
40|$|The {{premise of}} {{traditional}} methods of reliability predictions, such as MIL-HDBK- 217, is that the failure rate of a system is primarily determined by the components comprising the system. Historically, {{a significant number of}} failures also stem from non-component causes such as design deficiencies, manufacturing defects, inadequate requirements, induced failures, etc., that have not been explicitly addressed in prediction methods. The data in Figure 1 contains the nominal percentage of failures attributable to each of the eight identified predominant failure causes based on data collected by the Reliability Analysis Center. The definitions of these failure causes are as follows: Parts- Failure resulting from a part (e. g. microcircuit, transistor, resistor, connector, etc.) failing to perform its intended function. Design- Failure resulting from an inadequate design. Examples are tolerance stack-up, unanticipated logic conditions, a non-robust design for given environmental stresses, etc. Manufacturing- Failure resulting from anomalies in the manufacturing process, (i. e. <b>faulty</b> solder <b>joints,</b> bent connector pins, etc.). System Management- Failure to interpret system requirements, or failure to provide the resources required to design and build a reliable system. Wearout- Failure resulting from wearout related failure mechanisms. Examples of components exhibiting wearout related failure mechanisms are electrolytic capacitors, solder joints, tubes (TWTs), and switch and relay contacts. No Defect- Perceived failure that cannot be reproduced upon further testing. These failures {{may or may not be}} actual failures; however they are removals and therefore count toward the logistic failure rate. Induced- Failure resulting from an externally applied stress. Examples are electrical overstress and maintenance induced failures. Software- Failure of a system to perform its intended function due to the manifestation of a software fault. In 1994, the U. S. Military Specifications and Standards Reform initiative decreed the adoption of performance based specifications for acquiring and modifying weapon systems. This led to the cancellation of many military specifications and standards. This, coupled with the fact the Air Force has re-directed th...|$|R
40|$|The {{reliability}} of service life prediction of building components strongly affects {{the effectiveness of}} maintenance policy setting. Despite continuous research and development efforts, existing methods still suffer lack of robustness. Typical failure mechanisms in exterior cladding systems, deterioration patterns, and service life limiting coefficients (modifying factors) are identified {{for a range of}} failure mechanisms. The method is based on monitoring the physical and visual performance of building components under similar service conditions, at different periods in the building service life. Three types of exterior cladding are studied: cementitious mortar, synthetic rendering, and ceramic mosaic. Failure mechanisms identified include: lack of design details (such as drip-edge and expansion <b>joints),</b> <b>faulty</b> design under marine environment, exposure to air pollution, and poor workmanship. Three typical deterioration patterns under failure conditions were determined statistically, namely, linear, exponential and logarithmic. The proposed method addresses two issues raised in ISO- 15686 in order to improve the precision and {{reliability of}} service life forecasting: (a) modifying factors for quantifying the effect of failure mechanisms are estimated within 80 % confidence limits and (b) the prediction models yield high degrees of fit to the data (coefficient of determination values ranging between R 2 �=� 0. 88 and R 2 �=� 0. 96 at a 0. 0001 level of significance).
