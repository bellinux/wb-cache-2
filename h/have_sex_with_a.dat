50|$|A {{heterosexual}} threesome {{may involve}} {{two men and}} a woman, or one man and two women - that is, two men <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> woman (for example, in double penetration), or two women <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man. A bisexual threesome may involve <b>a</b> man <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man and a woman, the woman <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man and a woman, or all three <b>having</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> each other. <b>A</b> homosexual threesome would involve either three men or three women.

5000|$|In {{the early}} nineties, {{independent}} film Go Fish (1994), which portrays a lesbian love story, had a bisexual {{moment in which}} <b>a</b> lesbian-identified character <b>has</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man and {{on her way home}} is challenged by a [...] "jury," [...] who question whether <b>a</b> woman who <b>has</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man can call herself a lesbian. She contrasts how a gay man who <b>has</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> woman is characterized as being [...] "bored, drunk or lonely" [...] but if <b>a</b> lesbian <b>has</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man [...] "her whole life choice becomes suspect." [...] In 1997, Kevin Smith's Chasing Amy took on the question of sexual identity in a story about a lesbian-identified woman who falls in love <b>with</b> <b>a</b> man.|$|R
25|$|The age {{of consent}} in Rhode Island is 16. Sexual {{intercourse}} {{with a minor}} aged 14–15 by an actor 18 or older is third degree sexual assault, sexual intercourse with a minor {{under the age of}} 14 by an actor of any age is child molestation. However, there is a close-in-age exception that allows people aged 16–17 to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> minor aged 14 or 15, but not younger.|$|E
25|$|In June 2012, Rances Ulices Amaya, {{a leader}} of MS-13, of Springfield was sentenced to 50 {{years in prison for}} child prostitution. He was convicted in February 2012 for {{trafficking}} girls as young as 14 into a prostitution ring. They were lured from middle schools, high schools, and public shelters. Once acquired by Amaya, they were required to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> minimum of 10 individuals per day.|$|E
25|$|There is an exception. If {{the victim}} is less than 18 and the partner is a parent, guardian, sibling or any other person closer than a fourth cousin or has any type of {{authority}} over the victim (for example, a teacher) then the assailant may be charged with a crime. For instance, it's criminal for a manager of any age to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 17-year-old subordinate, even if the sex is consensual.|$|E

25|$|The age {{of consent}} in Wisconsin is 18 {{and there is}} no close-in-age {{exception}}. There is, however, a marital exception which allows a person to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> minor 16 or older if they are married to the minor. If the minor is below 16 both sexual intercourse and any sexual contact are a felony; sexual intercourse with a minor 16-17 by a perpetrator who is not married to the minor is a Class A misdemeanor. However, Wisconsin has a child enticement law that prohibits people of any age from taking people under 18 to a private area such as a room and exposing a sex organ to them or having the minor expose their sex organ to them. This is a Class B or C felony.|$|E
25|$|However, most {{educational}} institutions, including {{privately owned}} schools {{open to the}} general public, are public services. They are subject to human rights acts and are strictly required to not discriminate against staff or students based on all the prohibited grounds, including sexual orientation, HIV/AIDS (and transsexuality and transgenderism, see Grounds of prohibited discrimination above). They are strictly liable for harassment, name-calling and bullying of students and staff by staff on these grounds. In addition, {{as a result of}} the Jubran decision, they are liable for most such behaviour by students. They may be liable for anti-gay bullying even if the victim is not gay, nor believed to be (e.g. when a bully knowingly makes a false claim that a girl is a lesbian so that she will be ostracized or bullied by others or pressured to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> boy to prove otherwise).|$|E
25|$|Sexting is the {{practice}} of an individual using cell phone messaging to send nude or semi-nude images of themselves to others (such as friends or dating partners). These may be passed along to others or be posted on the Internet. In many jurisdictions, the age of consent {{is lower than the}} age of majority, and a minor who is over the age of consent can legally <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> person of the same age. Many laws on child pornography were passed before cell phone cameras became common among teenagers over the age of consent and sexting was understood as a phenomenon. Because laws were created around the age of majority, teenagers who are legally able to consent to sex can be charged with production and distribution of child pornography if they send naked images of themselves to friends or sex partners of the same age. The University of New Hampshire’s Crimes Against Children Research Center estimates that 7 percent of people arrested on suspicion of child pornography production in 2009 were teenagers who shared images with peers consensually. In some countries, mandatory sentencing requires anybody convicted of such an offence to be placed on a sex offender registry.|$|E

Zelda found condoms that he had purchased before any encounter occurred, and a bitter fight ensued, resulting in lingering jealousy.

500|$|Most such {{operations}} are over {{very quickly and}} result in guilty pleas, but entrapment is sometimes alleged, and a protracted investigation of a Florida man led to the first Internet entrapment case to be considered at the appellate level. Writing for a Ninth Circuit majority (the arrest occurred in California) in Poehlman v United States, 217 F3d 692 (9th Cir 2000), Judge Alex Kozinski reversed the conviction, saying the defendant had met the Jacobson standard and shown {{that the idea of}} crossing state lines to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> minor had been implanted only after extensive email correspondence with an undercover FBI agent. In 2014 a case resulting from a sting operation was ruled by a Federal court to have been [...] "cut from whole cloth" [...] by ATF operatives and to have constituted as entrapment by the ATF; the case was thrown out.|$|E

This [...] "apparent homophobia" [...] was said to have resulted in the episode being [...] "widely criticized" [...] by David Greven {{in his book}} Gender and Sexuality in Star Trek. Keith DeCandido, in his article for Tor.com, said it was difficult to give a fair review of the episode due to the Trill being explored in greater depth in Deep Space Nine, and the subsequent alterations made for that series compared to [...] "The Host". He said more generally of the episode that the romance felt rushed, and {{he would have liked to}} see the exploration of Riker's feelings about his body being used to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> friend. A further criticism was levelled at the ending, as Crusher stated that it was humans who have a problem with homosexuality rather than limiting it to be her own problem.

The next morning, when Steve is watching a movie on television, Stan abruptly pushes him off the couch and claims it as his [...] "territory" [...] by peeing all over it. Steve becomes furious, and he tells Francine about the situation in the kitchen. Francine tells him that Stan is intimidated by him, and that he feels that he will be dethroned of his dominance by him. Puzzled, Steve talks to Stan about the issue and openly challenges him of his position as the dominant person in the household. Though Steve manages to outdo him in everything, Stan is inspired by a walrus documentary to do the one thing his son can not do: have sex. Turning to Roger for help, Steve is suggested to go to a party to get laid. Informed by Klaus of this, Stan rushes to the party to stop his son. However, upon arriving there, Stan learns that Steve's various attempts to <b>have</b> <b>sex</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> girl failed miserably as the boy is having a mental breakdown. Roger explains now there's no threat to Steve challenging Stan, and no threat of Steve's future son (whom shall never be born) challenging him.

[...] However, Priscilla Presley states in her autobiography that they did have sex again after the birth of their daughter, and actress Barbara Leigh, who had a relationship with the singer after the birth of her own child, claimed that they made love often, despite Elvis' being aware of her child.
