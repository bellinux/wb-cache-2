An event that further deteriorated Darwaza's ambitions of Arab unity was the confirmation of the British Mandate over Palestine at the San Remo Conference on 24 April 1920. His experience in Damascus revealed to him that the universalism of Arab nationalism was not as concrete as its advocates had thought, and the military might of the colonial powers—France and Great Britain—were an overwhelming force to contend with.|$|E

However, VanDerWerff was more critical of the final scene, noting that it made Doggett come across as [...] "kind of an asshole". Paul Spragg of Xposé wrote positively of the episode, saying it features a [...] "return to the body horror stories that had worked so well in the early seasons".
