5|$|Many of {{the most}} legendary music venues in Baltimore have been shut down, {{including}} most of the shops, churches, bars and other destinations on the legendary Pennsylvania Avenue, center for the city's jazz scene. The Royal Theater, {{once one of the}} premiere destinations for African American performers on the East Coast, is marked only by a simple plaque, the theater itself having been demolished in 1971. A statue of Billie Holiday remains on Pennsylvania Avenue, however, between Lafayette and Lanvale, with a plaque that reads I don't think I'm singing. I feel like I am playing a horn. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to improvise. What comes out is what I feel.|$|E
5|$|I've {{always tried}} to insert {{positivity}} into my songs wherever I can, to inspire other people who go through stuff. I mean the stuff they talked about in tabloids {{and the things that}} were so overly exaggerated, that's one aspect. I also went through a lot of personal stuff, a lot of family stuff this year. Losing a parent is an intense thing for anybody. It's brought me to another place. People are going to read into it as, 'This is Mariah and her struggle'. But the way <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to word it is, 'It's OK once you say I can make it through the rain.' Not just me going, 'I can make it through the rain,' it's me telling people that if you believe you can get through whatever you're going through, you can get to the other side.|$|E
25|$|When I am in my painting, I'm {{not aware}} of what I'm doing. It is only after a sort of 'get acquainted' period that I see what I have been about. I have no fear of making changes, {{destroying}} the image, etc., because the painting has {{a life of its}} own. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to let it come through. It is only when I lose contact with the painting that the result is a mess. Otherwise there is pure harmony, an easy give and take, and the painting comes out well.|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to find traces of a neo-conservative model the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality in Turkey. Firstly <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to explain {{significant}} collaboration between liberalism and conservatism in the neoliberal context. Subsequently, <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> {{to evaluate the}} Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality to see the neoconservative administration’s effects on local administrations based on market-oriented administration rationale. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to explain that the gender discourse was strengthened because of such administration rationale. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to evaluate this matter profoundly. I mentioned the Ladies Commission of RP (Welfare Party) and Kadın Koordinasyon Merkezi (Women Coordination Center (WCC)) in the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality as examples of models of conservative women’s political organizations. ...|$|R
25|$|In {{the whole}} of the ten years I have been working on radio and television, I have been working to a {{majority}} of women. I think women prefer men to be well-mannered, so I always try to watch my manners. They like men to be well dressed, so I do my best to observe this. Others bring to my notice the fact that I sometimes make grammatical errors in my speech; so, because of this, <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to watch my grammar – {{but at the same time}} I bear in mind that it's more profitable for me to be entertaining than to be perfect in my use of English.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and that is what <b>I</b> <b>try</b> and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E
500|$|Takemitsu {{attached}} the greatest {{importance to the}} director's conception of the film; {{in an interview with}} Max Tessier, he explained that, [...] "everything depends on the film itself... <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to concentrate as much as possible on the subject, so that I can express what the director feels himself. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to extend his feelings with my music." ...|$|E

500|$|In one of {{his first}} interviews, Cobain told Sounds {{journalist}} John Robb, [...] "When I write a song the lyrics are the least important thing. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to make things harder for myself, just to try to make myself a bit more angry. <b>I</b> <b>try</b> out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people. Most of the lyrics on the Bleach album are about my life in Aberdeen." ...|$|E

500|$|For many of Azaria's {{character}}s, much {{of their}} humor is derived from a [...] "funny voice", such as The Birdcage and Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian. He stated that [...] "being funny with a funny voice is more my comfort zone, a broader character that <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to humanize, a kind of silly or wacky persona that <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to fill in," [...] although he finds it [...] "much easier to be someone much closer to myself", as it requires [...] "less energy... than playing characters that are so out there and high strung".|$|E

500|$|Kubrick stated {{himself that}} [...] "there is no {{deliberate}} pattern {{to the stories}} that I have chosen to make into films.

As a result, Kubrick was often misunderstood by critics, and only once did he have unanimously positive reviews upon {{the release of a}} film—for Paths of Glory.|$|E
500|$|Meat Loaf {{says that}} he does not enjoy {{recording}} in studios. He compares the process to [...] "going to the dentist and having root canal everyday".

40|$|In my {{dissertation}} <b>i</b> <b>tried</b> {{to describe}} the systém of substituted parential care and substituted institutional care in our country. <b>I</b> also <b>tried</b> to describe changes in the systém from the 1950 until today. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to describe changes in the systém of substituted institutional care and changes of the institutions, which were using in this systém. <b>I</b> also <b>tried</b> to describe negative effects, which relates to living in the institutional care and <b>i</b> also <b>tried</b> to describe methods which can reduce those effects. There is also chapter about non-governmental organizations which tried to reduce negative effects {{of living in the}} institutional care. The second part of my dissertation (which includes the practise) is about the present situation, described by social workers who work with families in need. In this part of my dissertation <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> to describe present social systém, which gives a hand families in need with their troubles.

500|$|... "When I got {{the song}} and the lyrics, I {{thought it was an}} {{incredible}} song...

500|$|Allen {{has said}} that Match Point {{is one of his}} few [...] "A-films", and even [...] "arguably may be the best film that I've made.

500|$|Further {{incidents}} came {{in subsequent}} years. During the 2006 World Championship, Maguire said [...] "I don't {{want to be}} a fat world champion", a reference to Murphy.

500|$|Adam's {{off-screen}} {{background was}} established to reflect that of his father; the character was highly self-motivated, studying at college and beginning a career in finance. In an interview with Soaps In Depth, Engen said, [...] "Luckily, I'm {{not going to be}} compared to anyone else...anything I do and anything <b>I</b> <b>try</b> to project, and [...] kind of ideas that I have to influence the character are okay".

500|$|As {{her husband}} {{acquired}} military assignments, Feodora travelled throughout Germany. The marriage, however, {{did not improve}} relations between mother and daughter.
