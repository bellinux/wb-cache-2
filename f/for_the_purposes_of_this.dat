5|$|The Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works has {{protected}} the copyrights on literary, scientific, and artistic works since 1886. Article 9 of the Convention states that: Authors of {{literary and artistic works}} protected by this Convention shall have the exclusive right of authorising {{the reproduction of}} these works, in any manner or form.... Any sound or visual recording shall be considered as a reproduction <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> Convention. This means a composer has performing rights and control over how derivative works should be used, and the rights are retained at least 50 years after death, or even longer. Even if a song is a traditional arrangement in the public domain, performing rights can still be violated. Where they exist, performers rights may have a shorter duration than full copyright; for example, the Rome Convention sets a minimum term of twenty years after the performance. This created a market for bootleg CDs in the late 1980s, containing 1960s recordings.|$|E

Indeed, there is debate about whether aid impact should be measured empirically at all, but again, we will limit our scope to increasing the economic efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Scottish legal {{institutions}} in the High Middle Ages are, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> article, the informal and formal systems which governed and helped to manage Scottish society between the years 900 and 1288, a period roughly corresponding with the general European era usually called the High Middle Ages. Scottish society in this period was predominantly Gaelic. Early Gaelic law tracts, first written down in the ninth century reveal a society highly concerned with kinship, status, honour and the regulation of blood feuds. The early Scottish lawman, or Breitheamh, became the Latin Judex; the great Breitheamh became the magnus Judex, which arguably developed into the office of Justiciar, an office which survives to this day in that of Lord Justice General. Scottish common law {{began to take shape}} {{at the end of the}} period, assimilating Gaelic and Celtic law with practices from Anglo-Norman England and the Continent.|$|E
25|$|The cars, as built, {{featured}} an old {{style of}} WABCO passenger braking equipment previously used on passenger railroads. The braking schedule {{was known as}} AM(P). Originally, it was known as AM, but the 'P' was added later to distinguish the setup from newer AM types like AML. Therefore <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>purposes</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> notation, the P has been included in parentheses – as in Braking Schedule AM(P) – to acknowledge this change. On a train equipped with AM(P), there was no electric synchronization of braking throughout a train, so a braking effort took {{a few seconds to}} apply or release uniformly throughout a train as different cars reacted to the brake request (which was entirely pneumatic) at different times. Additionally, an operator could not partially reduce his braking effort so as to smooth out stops or correct if he had undershot the mark (a feature known as a graduated release of the brakes). The AM(P) setup required the train to fully release the brakes before they could be applied again. This made making precision stops in stations by motormen a real art, but a task that the majority of IRT motormen proved up to.|$|E
