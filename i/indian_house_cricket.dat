50|$|Gryllodes sigillatus, known {{commonly}} as the Tropical house cricket, <b>Indian</b> <b>house</b> <b>cricket,</b> or the banded cricket, {{is a small}} cricket probably {{native to}} Southwestern Asia, but has spread throughout tropical regions worldwide. Like its relative the House cricket, the Tropical house cricket is also raised commercially for feeding certain pets such as reptiles, birds, amphibians, and insectivorous arthropods.|$|E
50|$|Tropical <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> are {{relatively}} {{new to the}} pet trade, and are favored by many people, due to easier care requirements than the more-common <b>House</b> <b>cricket</b> or the Black field cricket. The banded crickets {{are said to be}} a lot more active than competitors, and live longer lifespans than the average <b>house</b> <b>cricket.</b> They also have a lower chitin content than average crickets, making digestibility easier. Tropical <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> are also immune to the CrPV virus. Care is similar to that of the <b>House</b> <b>cricket.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> {{as a source}} of food or feed is increasing. Meeting this demand will require {{efficient}} production systems. <b>House</b> <b>crickets</b> are often fed a combination of dry feed and fresh plant material. Supplying fresh plant material could improve growth and development, but also increases labour and costs. Two experiments were conducted to verify that provision of fresh plant materials has a beneficial effect on <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> performance. In the first experiment, <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> were provided with an ad libitum supply of chicken feed, a water dispenser, and with carrots at different frequencies: (1) daily; (2) three times a week; (3) first week daily then three times a week; (4) two weeks daily then three times a week; and (5) no carrots. When the first cricket in a container reached adulthood, all crickets in that container were harvested. Survival, development time and body weight were determined. In a second experiment feed conversion efficiency of <b>house</b> <b>crickets,</b> either provided with carrots daily or not at all, was compared. No effects of carrot provision on survival, development time, body weight or feed conversion efficiency were found. The outcomes of these parameters were similar to other studies in which crickets were provided with chicken feed. The results indicate that supplying carrots in addition to a suitable dry feed and water does not improve <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> survival, development time, body weight and feed conversion efficiency. </p...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Two broiler chick feeding {{trials were}} {{conducted}} to determine the protein quality of dried <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> meal. The first used semipurified diets to identify limiting amino acids. There {{were no significant differences}} in weight gain of chicks fed diets with amino acid additions, but feed:gain ratios indicated that arginine, methionine, and tryptophan were probably limiting. In the second experiment, dried <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> meal was incorporated into practical diets replacing soybean meal as the major source of protein. There {{were no significant differences in}} weight gain between chicks fed corn-soybean meal diet and those fed corn-cricket diets. Feed:gain ratios improved significantly when diets were supplemented with methionine and arginine.

40|$|When attacked, crickets may shed or 'autotomize' an {{entrapped}} limb {{in order}} to escape a would-be predator. We {{examined the relationship between}} limb autotomy, running speed and susceptibility to future predation in <b>house</b> <b>crickets</b> (Acheta domestica). Hind limb autotomy resulted in a significant reduction in escape speed and ability to jump during the escape run, and greater predation by both lizards (striped skink Mabuya striata punctatissima) and mice (pouched mouse Saccostomus campestris). Although limb autotomy may enable a <b>house</b> <b>cricket</b> to escape a predatory encounter, autotomy of even one hind limb results in immediate costs to escape speed in crickets and makes the animal more vulnerable to subsequent predator encounters...|$|R
