These attacks were aimed at pushing the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> to more advantageous positions in preparation for a major attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived India Army infantry. It was not until the middle of September that the consolidated force was ready for large-scale operations. During this time the Occupation of the Jordan Valley continued.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Tabsor {{began with}} an intense {{creeping}} bombardment, during which three infantry divisions of the XXI Corps attacked the Tabsor defences; the only continuous trench-and-redoubt system on the Ottoman <b>front</b> <b>line.</b> As they advanced, their left flank was protected by the 60th Division, which advanced up the coast to the Nahr el Faliq, before capturing Tulkarm, {{the headquarters of the}} Eighth Army. Their right flank was secured by the 54th (East Anglian) Division, with the Détachment Français de Palestine et de Syrie pivoting on the Rafat salient. Defending the Ottoman <b>front</b> <b>line</b> against the attacks by the 3rd (Lahore), 7th (Meerut) and 75th Divisions were four divisions of the Ottoman Eighth Army: the 7th, 20th and 46th Infantry Divisions of the Ottoman XXII Corps and the 19th Division of the German Asia Corps. By {{the end of the first}} day of battle, the Ottoman 7th Division had ceased to exist and the Ottoman <b>front</b> <b>line</b> (which had previously stretched east-west from the coast) had been pushed and bent back to run north-south. The Seventh Army, further inland, was forced to withdraw when the Eighth Army was outflanked, to conform with the new Ottoman <b>front</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|With the 11th Light Armoured Motor Battery and 1st Light Car Patrol attached, the 4th Cavalry Division watered at the 'Auja River {{before moving}} to the {{south-east}} of Jlil, close behind the infantry and the <b>front</b> <b>line.</b> From here, a divisional pioneer party reached the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> at 07:00 on 19 September to cut a gap and flag a path through the Ottoman wire. By 08:40 permission was given by the 7th (Meerut) Division, which had attacked the western sector of the Tabsor defences, for the 4th Cavalry Division, accompanied by three horse artillery batteries which had rejoined the division after taking part in the bombardment and creeping barrage {{at the beginning of the}} Battle of Sharon, to pass through the gap in the Ottoman <b>front</b> <b>line</b> defences created by their attacks.|$|E
5|$|According to Pucar, the Prijedor Company was {{directed}} to attack Ljubija. On 30July, contrary to Stojanović's direct order, the insurgents attacked Veliko Palančište and rescued fifteen hostages held by the Ustaše. The insurgents then advanced toward Prijedor and developed a position facing the town, which was defended by Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and German forces. A <b>front</b> <b>line</b> stabilised {{after three days of}} fighting, leaving the Prijedor Company in control of seven villages. Railway traffic between Ljubija and Zagreb was disrupted, stopping the export of iron ore from Ljubija to Germany. The uprising in Kozara also involved the districts of Dubica and Novi. By mid-August, five detachments of Partisans had been formed within the territory held by the Kozara insurgents. These detachments, including the Prijedor Detachment commanded by Stojanović, together held the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> facing Kozarac, Prijedor, Lješljani, Dobrljin, Kostajnica, and Dubica.|$|E

5|$|Each side's <b>front</b> <b>line</b> was {{constantly}} under observation by snipers and lookouts during daylight; movement was therefore restricted {{until after the}} dusk stand-to and night had fallen. Under the cover of darkness, troops attended to vital maintenance and resupply, with rations and water being brought to the <b>front</b> <b>line,</b> fresh units swapped places with troops moving to the rear for rest and recuperation. Trench raiding was also carried out and construction parties formed to repair trenches and fortifications, while wiring parties were sent out to repair or renew the barbed wire in no man's land. An hour before dawn, everyone would stand-to once more.|$|E
5|$|Following the Capture of Jericho in February, the {{commander}} of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), General Edmund Allenby ordered the occupation of the Jordan Valley. In March–April and April–May 1918, the First and the Second Transjordan attacks took place, while the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> across the Judean Hills to the Mediterranean Sea was defended. During this time, three-quarters of the British infantry and yeomanry cavalry regiments were redeployed to the Western Front to counter Ludendorff's Spring Offensive. They were replaced by British India Army infantry and cavalry which required a reorganisation. These newly arrived soldiers carried out a series of attacks on sections of the Ottoman <b>front</b> <b>line</b> in the Judean Hills during the summer months, as part of their training. These attacks including the Battle of Tell 'Asur and Action of Berukin in March and April, were aimed at pushing the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> to more advantageous positions in preparation for a major attack, and to acclimatise the newly arrived infantry. This fighting continued during the summer months. By the middle of September the consolidated EEF was once again ready for large-scale offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|For Alderson {{the battle}} {{had been a}} failure: {{although}} his troops had held, he had found himself {{out of touch with}} the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> and unable to get accurate information about the situation. At one stage he had been commanding 33 battalions across several miles of <b>front</b> <b>line</b> with no central co-ordination and great confusion between his distant headquarters and the trenches. In addition to his personal failings however, the Ross rifles had proven almost useless in battle and some of Alderson's officer corps had performed poorly. In particular Brigadier-General Richard Turner, commander of the 3rd Brigade, and Turner's brigade-major, Colonel Garnet Hughes, the son of Sam Hughes, caused much havoc when on the second day of the battle, they unilaterally withdrew the 3rd Brigade from the <b>front</b> <b>line,</b> opening up a 4,000-yard gap through which the Germans threatened the entire Ypres Salient. Colonel John Carson however, who reported personally to Hughes, downplayed the difficulties and blamed the heavy casualties on Alderson's leadership, indicating that the division had only been saved from annihilation by the actions of Turner and Hughes.|$|E

5|$|In early June 1916, the Canadian Corps {{was again}} posted to {{trenches}} around the Belgian town of Ypres. The new {{commander of the}} Canadian Corps, Julian Byng, was inspecting the Corps positions {{in front of a}} German-held rise named Mount Sorrel and noted that the Canadian troops were overlooked by German positions and under constant danger of enemy fire. The Germans also seemed to be digging new sap trenches which implied that an assault was intended. Byng ordered Mercer to make a reconnaissance of the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> and draw up a plan to overrun the more dangerous German positions in a local attack. Mercer complied on the 2 June, conducting a standard inspection of <b>front</b> <b>line</b> Canadian trenches at 08:30.|$|E
5|$|Infantry {{attacks by}} the British Empires XXI Corps {{had begun the}} Battle of Sharon on 19 September, along an almost {{continuous}} trench line from the Mediterranean across the Plain of Sharon and into {{the foothills of the}} Judean Hills. These attacks captured the Ottoman <b>front</b> <b>line</b> at Tulkarm, Tabsor, and Arara, in the process outflanking and decimating the Ottoman Eighth Army on the coast. During the attack on Tulkarm, the infantry created a gap in the Ottoman <b>front</b> <b>line</b> defences, through which cavalry from General Edmund Allenby's Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF) rode north. The three cavalry divisions in the Desert Mounted Corps successfully captured the Ottoman Seventh and Eighth Armies' lines of communication across the Esdraelon Plain from their headquarters in the Judean Hills.|$|E

Leibstandarte was to strengthen its <b>front</b> <b>line</b> and co-ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with Totenkopfs attack from the northwest.
