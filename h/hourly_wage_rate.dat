5000|$|One way to {{understand}} the wage curve is as follows. The labour supply of each individual is positively correlated to wages, therefore the higher is the hourly wage offered, the more hours an individual is willing to work. However, {{there is a limit}} to which every person would be willing to sacrifice an hour of leisure or rest, for an hour's worth of wages. Let's say that X is the maximum amount of hours a person can work, and $A is the minimum <b>hourly</b> <b>wage</b> <b>rate</b> he expects in return. Any wage $B, greater than $A, will increase the worker's daily wage without increasing the hours of work. So if you need more hours of work than X, you need to hire more people.|$|E

50|$|Adidas {{has been}} criticized for {{operating}} sweatshops, particularly in Indonesia. Between 2006 and 2007, Adidas rejected many of its suppliers that supported unions for subcontractors with less reputable labour rights records. By subcontracting work to different suppliers, it is more difficult for Adidas to ensure company labour standards are enforced. Workplace standards that Adidas' policy upholds include the freedom for workers to take part in collective bargaining and a non-retaliation policy towards workers who express concerns. In practice, however, many of Adidas' suppliers have not upheld these standards. At the Panarub factory in Java, 33 workers were fired after striking for better pay in 2005. PT Kizone is another Indonesian factory where Adidas has received criticism over treatment of workers. They produced products for Adidas as well as Nike and the Dallas Cowboys until they closed in January 2011. 2,686 workers who were laid off are owed $3 million in severance pay and benefits. Nike has contributed $1.5 million but Adidas has not acted. A campaign has been initiated by United Students Against Sweatshops calling for universities to cut contracts with Adidas. On 16 July 2012, War on Want organised activists in London to replace Adidas price tags in sports stores with 34p ones, a reference to the low <b>hourly</b> <b>wage</b> <b>rate</b> paid to the Indonesian workers who make Adidas goods. The campaign group Labour Behind the Label claimed that the basic pay of Indonesian Adidas workers was only £10 a week. William Anderson, head of social and environmental affairs for the Asia Pacific region, posted an entry on the company blog in which he sought to justify the 34p an hour pay rate.|$|E

Among the concepts of labor, demand and supply of labor are very important in practical sense. The determination of wages in a free market simply depends on the socioeconomic characteristics of the labor force. Therefore, an attempt is made to explore {{the relationships between the}} wage rates and demographic characteristics of labor force using econometric methods. The required data are obtained from the records of Labor Force and Socioeconomic Survey conducted by the Department of Census and Statistics. An econometric model for wage rates using the demographic characteristics as independent variables is fitted and verified. The study reveals that age, gender, civil status, ethnicity etc. have significant influences in determining the wages. Hence, it is emphasized that the demographic characteristics should be taken into consideration whendetermining the wages of aparticular labor force inherited in the respective areas of the country.
