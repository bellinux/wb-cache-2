50|$|System scaffoldings are {{not only}} being used for work and {{protective}} scaffolding, but also {{for a variety of}} further tasks: for instance shoring, temporary access or site protection. Today Layher products are worldwide in use on sites, in the industry or in sports and cultural events. In 2009, for example, a 150 metre long and 56 metre high ski ramp was assembled in Moscow as a promotional event for the 2014 Winter Olympics using about 1,300 tons of Allround Scaffolding. For viewing the excavations in ancient Pompeii, a weather protection roof and a temporary pedestrian walkway were erected in 2010 using Allround Scaffolding. This modular system was also used a short time later for the Cannstatter Volksfest - not as a pedestrian walkway but as a 30 metre wide escape stairway. The use of the Allround Bridging System in 2012 enabled the scaffolding for the stave church in Borgund, Norway. In 2013 followed the construction of a 600 square metre Allround Shoring TG 60 structure for the pumped storage power station project “Linthal 2015” in Switzerland. Also high in the Swiss mountains, the SpeedyScaf ensured in 2014 the rapid assembly of a work scaffold at the “Hörnli Hut” below the Matterhorn, and the “Arup Building” of the University of Cambridge was temporarily roofed over using a 2,600 square metre <b>Keder</b> Roof XL.

30|$|In Drosophila nervous system, NSCs remain {{quiescent}} at early larval {{stages and}} proliferate at embryonic and adult phases, and the Hippo pathway {{has been shown}} to control the quiescence of NSCs. Yki is inactive and localized in the cytoplasm when NSCs are quiescent, and Yki will relocate to the nucleus to regulate NSC proliferation and growth during NSC reactivation. Suppression of Hippo pathway upstream regulators such as Wts leads to premature exit from quiescence and reactivation of NSCs (Ding et al., 2016). Poon et al. also demonstrated that the Hippo pathway restricts proliferation of neural stem cells, controls neuroblast reactivation from quiescence during postembryonic neurogenesis of Drosophila, and perturbation of Tao, Hpo, or Wts, or overexpression of Yki, leads to brain overgrowth (Poon et al., 2016). Moreover, the Hippo pathway can modulate asymmetric cell division of NSCs (<b>Keder</b> et al., 2015) and regulate glial cell proliferation (Reddy and Irvine, 2011). In the future, {{it will be interesting to}} study the function of the Hippo pathway in neural degenerative diseases or neural regeneration following injuries.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the {{monetary}} use and function of the Anglo-Scandinavian coinages, especially the Sigtuna coinage. Ever since their discovery by the Swedish scholar Nicolas <b>Keder,</b> in 1706, the Anglo-Scandinavian coinages have been puzzling. In the early days of numismatic research their status among other Viking-age and early medieval coinages was not clearly understood, nor was it clear how they should be classified. Today, their status as Scandinavian imitations of English coins – minted in Viking towns such as Sigtuna and Lund – has been recognized. Their numismatic classification has recently been accomplished by meticulous die-studies, but the question of how they were used as means of payment remains unresolved. It is suggested that the coinages did not necessarily have a nominal value, but an officially sanctioned exchange-value, which could only be reckoned and valued by weight and not by number. In such a monetary system, which had both elements of a coin-based and a bullion-based economy, weighing was probably the only way in which to settle the exchange-value. The archaeological evidence from the Sigtuna mint seems to suggest that the Sigtuna coins were weighed with oblate spheroid weights. These weights follow the Islamic mitqal standard which was the basis for the Scandinavian ertog standard. It is also argued that at some stage in the bullion economy, coined silver was preferred to hack-silver in transactions. Because of that there might have existed a similar situation in the transactional sphere in the Viking Age, as later during the Middle Ages, whereby different qualities of silver were recognized and valued according to different exchange-rates. This change in the transactional sphere had probably been influenced by the arrival of Western European silver coins to Scandinavia at the turn of the first millennium AD. Finally, the Anglo-Scandinavian coinages probably did not have any monetary valueoutside the strongholds in which they were minted. They were intended for use only by people visiting the town and using its market. It would be reasonable to suggest a short time period of value and use during which these coins were regarded as being worth more than ordinary weighed silver. Another conclusion based on this observation is that both English coins and Anglo-Scandinavian imitations were regarded as being of the same silver quality and handled for a higher exchange-rate than, for instance, German coins or hack-silver in the Sigtuna market...|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of semilocal {{models for the}} kinetic energy density (<b>KED)</b> is an important topic in density functional theory (DFT). This {{is especially true for}} subsystem DFT, where these models are necessary to construct the required non-additive embedding contributions. In particular, these models can also be efficiently employed to replace the exact <b>KED</b> in meta-Generalized Gradient Approximation (meta-GGA) exchange-correlation functionals allowing to extend the subsystem DFT applicability to the meta-GGA level of theory. Here, we present a two-dimensional scan of semilocal <b>KED</b> models as linear functionals of the reduced gradient and of the reduced Laplacian, for atoms and weakly-bound molecular systems. We find that several models can perform well but in any case the Laplacian contribution is extremely important to model the local features of the <b>KED.</b> Indeed a simple model constructed as the sum of Thomas-Fermi <b>KED</b> and 1 / 6 of the Laplacian of the density yields the best accuracy for atoms and weakly-bound molecular systems.

Sheep <b>keds</b> were 100 % prevalent in sheep from five organic farms in Croatia, Southeastern Europe, whereas trypanosomes morphologically compatible with T. melophagium were 86 % {{prevalent in the}} guts of the sheep <b>keds.</b> Multilocus phylogenetic analyses using sequences of small subunit rRNA, glycosomal glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase, spliced leader, and internal transcribed spacer 1 of the rDNA distinguished T. melophagium from all allied trypanosomes from other ruminant species and placed the trypanosome in the subgenus Megatrypanum. Trypanosomes from sheep <b>keds</b> from Croatia and Scotland, the only available isolates for comparison, shared identical sequences. All biologic and phylogenetic inferences support the restriction of T. melophagium to sheep and, especially, to the sheep <b>keds.</b> The comparison of trypanosomes from sheep, cattle, and deer from the same country, which was never achieved before this work, strongly supported the host-restricted specificity of trypanosomes of the subgenus Megatrypanum.
