25|$|The bearing {{operator}} {{would then}} turn the entire receiver hut using a gear set connected to bicycle pedals, {{looking for the}} point when the signal disappeared, indicating that the target was now perfectly aligned between the two antennas. This null-seeking system was often used as it more sharply indicates locations; maximum signals tend to be spread out. If the target was not aligned, {{the presence of the}} signal could not indicate which direction to turn. To address this, an <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> system on the antenna feeds allowed them to be connected together in different phases, and by studying the way the blip changed as the switch was turned, the operator could determine which antenna was closer to the target, a process known as bracketing. The phasing system had been introduced by E.C. Slow, and became known as the Slowcock.|$|E
25|$|Manipulation of the {{electron}} beam is performed using two physical effects. The interaction of electrons with a magnetic field will cause electrons to move according to the left hand rule, thus allowing for electromagnets to manipulate {{the electron}} beam. The use of magnetic fields allows {{for the formation of}} a magnetic lens of variable focusing power, the lens shape originating due to the distribution of magnetic flux. Additionally, electrostatic fields can cause the electrons to be deflected through a constant angle. Coupling of two deflections in opposing directions with a small intermediate gap allows for the formation of a shift in the beam path, this being used in TEM for beam shifting, subsequently this is extremely important to STEM. From these two effects, as well as the use of an electron imaging system, sufficient control over the beam path is possible for TEM operation. The optical configuration of a TEM can be rapidly changed, unlike that for an optical microscope, as lenses in the beam path can be enabled, have their strength changed, or be disabled entirely simply via rapid <b>electrical</b> <b>switching,</b> the speed of which is limited by effects such as the magnetic hysteresis of the lenses.|$|E

2500|$|An {{innovator}} in mathematics, statistics, philosophy, research methodology, {{and various}} sciences, Peirce considered himself, [...] first and foremost, a logician. He made major contributions to logic, but logic for him encompassed {{much of that}} which is now called epistemology and philosophy of science. He saw logic as the formal branch of semiotics, {{of which he is}} a founder, which foreshadowed the debate among logical positivists and proponents of philosophy of language that dominated 20th century Western philosophy; additionally, he defined the concept of abductive reasoning, as well as rigorously formulated mathematical induction and deductive reasoning. As early as 1886 he saw that logical operations could be carried out by <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> circuits; the same idea was used decades later to produce digital computers.|$|E
