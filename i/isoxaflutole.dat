In soil the half-life of <b>isoxaflutole</b> is very short, but the half-life of DKN is much longer. Sorption studies were conducted with five soils varying in {{physical and chemical properties}} using the batch equilibration technique. Analysis of 14 C-ring labeled <b>isoxaflutole</b> and DKN was performed using liquid scintillation counting, and sorption data were fitted to the Freundlich model. Isotherms of <b>isoxaflutole</b> and DKN in all the soils were nonlinear as depicted by the exponent (n 3 ̆c 1. 0), indicating differential distribution of sorption site energies in various soils. <b>Isoxaflutole</b> and DKN sorption increased with an increase in organic matter content of soils and decreased as the soil pH increased from 4. 5 to 8. 5, which was depicted by the reduction of KF values. Clay content of the soils did not have a high correlation with KF values, while the sorption of <b>isoxaflutole</b> was not influenced by the Ca 2 + concentration in the soil solution. There was an increase in the sorption of DKN with an increase in Ca 2 + concentration of the soil solution, while the net sorption constant (Kd) was correlated to the organic matter content of the soils. ^ A high correlation existed between the desorption coefficient, KFd and the organic matter content of soils, while the clay content did not greatly influence the desorption of DKN. Although the sorption of DKN was generally reversible, a sorption-desorption hysteresis was apparent in all soils. The site energy distribution curves emphasized the fact that DKN binds tightly to soils with higher organic matter content, and a larger proportion of DKN was retained by those soils. ^ In soils with high organic matter content, the sorption-desorption hysteresis was mainly governed by organic matter content, but in soils with low organic matter, clay content played an important role. When <b>isoxaflutole</b> and DKN were added to soil, the carbonyl stretching frequency decreased as observed in the diffuse reflectance Fourier transformed infrared (DRIFT) spectra. In conclusion, the potential for leaching through soil and crop injury due to <b>isoxaflutole</b> and its metabolite would decrease as soil organic matter and clay content increase. ...|$|E

The objective of this research was to increase the understanding of the behaviour and environmental fate of <b>isoxaflutole</b> and its diketonitrile (DKN) degradate in soil, including determination of the strength of sorption to soil and whether sorption is affected by ageing. In sandy loam (SL) and silty clay (SiCl) soils, 14 C-isoxaflutole was found to dissipate rapidly after application to soil; recovery ranged from ∼ 42 % to 68 % at week 0, and recovery had decreased to < 10 % at week 12. Decreases in 14 C <b>isoxaflutole</b> residues over time in SL and SiCl soils are consistent with hydrolysis of <b>isoxaflutole</b> and formation of bound DKN residues in the soil. DKN recovery from freshly treated SiCl and SL soils was 41 % to 52 %. After a 12 -week incubation in SL soil at pH 7. 1 and 8. 0, recoveries were similar, ∼ 40 %. However, at week 12 in SL soil pH 5. 7, DKN recovery decreased to ∼ 28 %. DKN recovery in SiCl soil at week 12 was < 10 %. Increases in sorption of DKN in SL at pH 5. 7 and SiCl soil over time indicate that the DKN degradate is tightly bound to the soil and sorption is affected by soil pH and soil type. Sorption of 14 C-DKN in the SiCl soil more than doubled with ageing compared with the lower Kd sorption coefficient values of the SL soils.

There were four periods of water restriction (0, 30, 60 and 90 days), seven chemical treatments [diuron + hexazinone + sulfometuron-methyl (1387 + 391 + 33. 35 g a. i. ha- 1), diuron + hexazinone + sulfometuron-methyl (1507. 5 + 425 + 36. 25 g a. i. ha- 1), diuron + hexazinone + sulfometuron-methyl (1658. 25 + 467. 5 + 39. 87 g a. i. ha- 1), diuron + hexazinone + sulfometuron­methyl (1809 + 510 + 43. 5 g a. i. ha- 1), amicarbazone (1190 g a. i. ha- 1), amicarbazone + <b>isoxaflutole</b> (840 + 82. 5 g a. i. ha- 1) ] and a control with no application. At 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after the restoration of moisture, control was visually evaluated. After the final evaluation, the dry mass of morning glories was measured. At 90 days of water restriction, diuron + hexazinone + sulfometuron-methyl was more effective to control I. hederifolia than the amicarbazone + <b>isoxaflutole</b> tank mixture. The four diuron + hexazinone + sulfometuron­methyl doses have reduced morning glory dry mass to zero; whereas treatments with amicarbazone have not. The most effective treatment for morning glory control was diuron + hexazinone + sulfometuron-methyl. This result {{may be due to}} a possible synergistic interaction...|$|E

The experiments were established in the field according to a randomized complete block design with four repetitions in a 7 x 2 split-plot scheme. In the plots, five herbicide treatments were studied (S-metolachlor at 1. 44, 1. 92, and 2. 40 kg ha- 1, clomazone at 1. 20 kg ha- 1, and <b>isoxaflutole</b> at 0. 188 kg ha- 1), and two control treatments with no herbicide application. In the subplots, the presence or absence of sugar cane crop residue on the soil surface was evaluated. S-metolachlor efficacy was not hampered by either 14 or 20 t ha- 1 of sugar cane crop residue on the soil surface. When sugar cane crop residue was covering the soil surface, S-metolachlor at a rate of 1. 44 kg ha- 1 resulted in weed control similar at their larger rates, where as without the presence of crop residue, S-metolachlor controlled B. decumbens, D. horizontalis, and P. maximum at the rates of 1. 92, 1. 44, and 1. 92 kg ha- 1, respectively. The herbicides clomazone and <b>isoxaflutole</b> were effective for the studied species, independently of the crop residue covering the soil surface. S-metolachlor caused no visible injury symptoms to the sugar cane plant. Clomazone and <b>isoxaflutole</b> caused visible injuries to the sugar cane plant.

In all four trials, the studied factors (stand density, herbicide type and dose) had significant impact on herbicide efficiency and on maize cob yield loss. The herbicide efficiency decreased sig-nificantly, when herbicides were applied to maize of lower stand density and the maize yield losses increased. When weed population was composed predominantly of annual seed weeds higher efficiency was obtained by HS herbicides, conversely, when the weed population was composed predominantly of perennial weeds the HF herbicides provided better control.

Seedlings were grown under controlled environment. Seedlings were harvested 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours after treatment (HAT) and sectioned into root, shoot/stalk and leaves. ^ Absorption of root applied radioactivity was 135. 6 (120 HAT) and 230 (96 HAT) disintegration per minute (dpm) mg− 1 fresh weight in velvetleaf and yellow foxtail, respectively. The translocation of root absorbed 14 C-isoxaflutole to shoot was 83. 6 % (120 HAT) in velvetleaf and 93 % (72 HAT) in yellow foxtail. When applied to the yellow foxtail foliage, absorption was maximum 24 HAT and translocation of 14 C-isoxaflutole from treated leaf to other plant parts reached its peak at 48 HAT (33. 4 %). Based on Rf values, applied radioactivity was partitioned into <b>isoxaflutole</b> (Rf = 0. 91), diketonitrile metabolite (Rf = 0. 62), unknown metabolite ‘A’ (Rf = 0. 49) and benzoic acid (Rf = 0. 29). Yellow foxtail had more benzoic acid content (21. 08 %) than the benzoic acid content (12. 85 %) in velvetleaf. The active herbicide fraction (total of diketonitrile metabolite and unknown metabolite ‘A’) was more in velvetleaf (80. 2 %) than in yellow foxtail (69. 9 %). The presence of high level of active herbicide fraction in velvetleaf may explain its susceptibility to <b>isoxaflutole.</b> ^ Absorption of root applied 14 C-isoxaflutole was more in Pioneer- 3751 corn hybrid (52. 1 dpm mg− 1 fresh weight in 24 h) than in Pioneer- 3394 corn hybrid (37. 5 dpm mg− 1 fresh weight 24 h).

Os herbicidas e respectivas doses (g i. a. ha- 1) avaliadas foram: diuron (400 e 800), metribuzin (360 e 720), <b>isoxaflutole</b> (60), atrazine (720), S-metolachlor (1. 920) e as misturas ametryn + clomazone (1. 350 + 1. 900), ametryn+trifluralin (1. 500 + 1. 350), isoxaflutole+metribuzin (60 + 320), isoxaflutole+diuron (60 + 400), combinados com uso de uma testemunha dupla adjacente a cada tratamento. Os cultivares utilizados neste trabalho foram Fécula Branca e Fibra. Apenas o herbicida S-metolachlor, para ambos os cultivares, e metribuzin (360 g i. a. ha- 1), para o cultivar Fibra, não provocaram injúrias. Atrazine provocou redução de estande para o cultivar Fécula Branca aos 60 DAP, mas não foi detectada redução na altura de plantas. Tanto atrazine (para os dois cultivares) quanto diuron na dose de 800 g i. a. ha- 1 (para o cultivar Fécula Branca) afetaram a produtividade de raízes. Dessa forma, atrazine foi considerado não seletivo para ambos os cultivares, e a maior dose de diuron foi também considerada não seletiva para o cultivar Fécula Branca. Há diferenças de tolerância entre os cultivares, sendo o Fibra, de modo geral, mais tolerante aos herbicidas avaliados.

Atrazine reduced plant density only for Fécula Branca at 60 DAS (days after seeding) but no difference in plant height was detected. Atrazine reduced plant density for cultivar Fécula Branca at 60 DAS, but no plant height reduction was detected. Both atrazine (for both cultivars) and diuron at a dose of 800 g a. i. ha- 1 (for Fécula Branca) affected root productivity.

The tillage systems consisted of either a conventional practice with mouldboard ploughing (28 cm-depth) or a conservation practice with superficial tillage (< 12 cm-depth). The management of the fallowperiod involved either a cover crop sown after maize or bare soil. Water drainage and <b>isoxaflutole</b> and its active diketonitrile metabolite leaching were determined under the four cropping systems using fibreglass wick lysimeters installed at 40 cm-depth. <b>Isoxaflutole</b> was rapidly degraded (half-lives < 2. 1 days) in soil for all cropping systems and years and its leaching was limited (< 1 % of applied dose). Diketonitrile was more mobile and was quantified each year in soil solution at 40 cm-depth. Cumulated losses of diketonitrile ranged from 1. 8 ± 0. 6 to 31. 5 ± 15. 1 % of applied dose according to the cropping system and year. Tillage system had no systematic effects on herbicide losses, but, considering the four years, significant lower losses were measured under conservation tillage. In a same way, using cover crops during the fallowperiod led to a decrease in herbicide losses compared to cropping systems where soil was left bare during the fallowperiod. The use of winter cover crop in continuous maize production showed promise to reduce diketonitrile losses by leaching...|$|E

The objectives of this research were 1) determine the effect of cultural and herbicidal control methods on resistant waterhemp in glufosinate-resistant soybean, 2) evaluate weed management programs and response of HPPD-resistant soybean to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides, and 3) investigate the distribution of herbicide resistances and molecular mechanisms conferring resistance in Missouri waterhemp populations. Results from this research indicate that preemergence followed by postemergence with residual (PRE fb POST w/RES) herbicide programs with 19 - or 38 -cm rows will provide the greatest glyphosate-resistant (GR) waterhemp control in glufosinate resistant soybean. PRE fb POST programs improved GR waterhemp control and biomass reduction over all one- and two-pass POST programs in HPPD-resistant soybean. The addition of <b>isoxaflutole</b> to PRE treatments in HPPD- resistant soybean was not always necessary to provide high levels of weed control, but incorporating <b>isoxaflutole</b> or mesotrione in PRE fb POST programs allows for a greater diversity of effective herbicide modes of action. Resistance to five major herbicide modes of action was confirmed with at least 52 % of 187 waterhemp populations being resistant to two modes of action. Results indicate PRE fb POST programs with multiple, effective modes of action will be necessary to control Missouri waterhemp populations in the future...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do trabalho foi estudar a seletividade de herbicidas para a cultura da cana-de-açúcar quando aplicado em culturas tratadas com nematicidas. O experimento foi instalado em área pertencente à Usina São José, município de Borebi-SP, ano agrícola de 2000 / 01. A variedade de cana-de-açúcar utilizada foi a RB 855113. Utilizou-se o delineamento {{experimental}} de blocos ao acaso em parcelas subdivididas, com quatro repetições. Cada parcela correspondeu a 27 linhas de 10, 0 m, espaçadas em 1, 0 m, sendo dividida em três subparcelas. As parcelas corresponderam aos tratamentos com os herbicidas, e as subparcelas, à aplicação ou não dos nematicidas carbofuran (2, 10 kg ha- 1) e terbufós 2, 25 kg ha��). Os herbicidas testados foram: tebuthiuron (1, 12 kg ha- 1), ametryne (1, 75 kg ha¹), sulfentrazone (0, 8 kg ha- 1), metribuzin (1, 92 kg ha- 1), <b>isoxaflutole</b> (0, 0525 kg ha¹), clomazone (1, 25 kg ha¹), oxyfluorfen (0, 36 kg ha- 1) e azafenidin+hexazinone (0, 1575 + 0, 2025 kg ha- 1), sendo todos aplicados em pré-emergência, além de uma parcela como testemunha. Os resultados obtidos evidenciaram que os herbicidas oxyfluorfen e azafenidin+hexazinone causaram os maiores níveis de fitotoxicidade na cana-de-açúcar, independentemente do uso dos nematicidas carbofuran e terbufós. Os herbicidas tebuthiuron, ametryne, sulfentrazone, metribuzin, <b>isoxaflutole,</b> clomazone, oxyfluorfen e azafenidin+hexazinone, aplicados em doses representativas das comercialmente utilizadas, mostraram-se seletivos à cana-de-açúcar, não afetando seu crescimento, sua produtividade e suas características tecnológicas. Os nematicidas não interferiram nos níveis de intoxicação provocados pelos herbicidas utilizados na cultura. The {{objective of}} this work was to study the selectivity of herbicides to sugarcane when applied in crops treated with nematicides. The experiment {{was carried out in}} Borebi, São Paulo-Brazil, during the growing season 2000 / 2001. The sugar cane variety RB 855113 was used. The experimental design was a randomized block in split-plots with 4 repetitions. Each plot corresponded to 27 rows of 10. 0 m, 1. 0 m spaced, split into three sub-plots. The plots corresponded to the treatments with the herbicides and the sub-plots to the application or not of the nematicides carbofuran (2. 10 kg ha- 1) and terbufos (2. 25 kg ha- 1). The following herbicides were studied: tebuthiuron (1. 12 kg ha- 1), ametryne (1. 75 kg ha- 1), sulfentrazone (0. 8 kg ha- 1), metribuzin (1. 92 kg ha¹), <b>isoxaflutole</b> (0. 0525 kg ha- 1), clomazone (1. 25 kg ha- 1), oxyfluorfen (0. 36 kg ha- 1) and azafenidin+ hexazinone (0. 1575 + 0. 2025 kg ha- 1). All the herbicides were applied in pre-emergence. The results showed that the herbicides oxyfluorfen and azafenidin+hexazinone caused the most severe phytotoxicity symptoms. Regardless of nematicide application, all the herbicides were selective to the crop, providing growth rates and yields similar to the controls. The selectivity of the herbicides was not affected by the nematicides...|$|E
40|$|Cow cockle (Vaccaria hispanica (Mill.) Rauschert) is an {{important}} medicinal weed. Its therapeutic properties are due to present of triterpenoid saponins. Large potential exists to use cow cockle as source of pharmaceutical products or as medicinal plant. Cow cockle seedlings are very cold tolerance. A limiting factor in cow cockle production is weed interference. Cow cockle crop can tolerate clethodim and <b>isoxaflutole</b> herbicides. Cow cockle responds strongly to nitrogen fertilization. Harvest occurred 90 - 100 days after sowing. Moreover, {{a number of different}} genotypes are available. The wild populations from different geographical regions constitute a gene pool that can be utilized for the improvement of cow cockle crop. The basic objective of breeding in cow cockle is the development of a variety with high saponin content. (C) 2012 Elsevier By. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{studies were}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of temperature and water pressure head {{on the degradation of}} the diketonitrile metabolite (DKN) of <b>isoxaflutole</b> during 84 d in samples collected in a loamy soil under conventional (CT) and conservation (MT) tillage systems. Soil temperature was the major factor controlling DKN degradation in the two tillage systems. The shortest half-lives (T 1 / 2) were measured in the seedbed samples under MT at 25 °C and - 33 cm water pressure head. We found that mouldboard ploughing under CT was responsible for the spatial variability of herbicide degradation properties, whereas under MT herbicide degradation was associated to the vertical distribution of organic matter. Tillage practices influence the spatial variability of diketonitrile degradation in soil and its sensitivity to pedoclimatic conditions...|$|E
40|$|Herbicide-resistant weeds in Arkansas cause {{problems}} for growers. Up-to-date information and new technologies can help plan mitigation strategies to slow resistant weeds. The objectives {{of this research}} were to provide a ‘snapshot’ of herbicide-resistant Echinochloa spp. in rice producing counties, determine how much resistance has spread across the state, and understand the effectiveness of 4 -hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) -inhibiting herbicides for control of glyphosate-resistant (GR) Palmer amaranth relative to commercial standards currently labeled in soybean. To assess the prevalence of Echinochloa spp. resistance, 82 samples were collected from 23 rice producing counties in 2010. The samples were tested for resistance to commonly used rice herbicides: propanil, quinclorac, imazethapyr, fenoxaprop, clomazone, and glyphosate. Of the 82 samples collected, 29 were resistant to propanil, 13 were resistant to quinclorac and 9 samples were resistant to both propanil and quinclorac. Accessions were also treated with 0. 5 x the labeled field rate for glufosinate and <b>isoxaflutole</b> to determine background variation in sensitivity among populations to these herbicides as Echinochloa is among the major weeds in crops where these herbicides are used. No resistance to imazethapyr, clomazone, fenoxaprop, or glyphosate was observed; likewise all accessions were sensitive to glufosinate or <b>isoxaflutole.</b> One strategy for controlling herbicide-resistant weeds {{is the use of}} transgenic crops. The expected release of soybean in 2016 and cotton in 2020 with resistance to HPPD-inhibiting herbicides provide alternative mechanisms-of-action to control weeds. Experiments were conducted in 2010 and 2011 to determine the efficacy of HPPD-inhibiting herbicides as a preemergence (PRE) option for Echinochloa spp. and Palmer amaranth control and as a postemergence (POST) option with and without glyphosate or glufosinate. The PRE applied HPPD-inhibiting herbicides do not carry the residual control as the current industry standards; however they are still capable of providing 4 weeks of control of Palmer amaranth and Echinochloa spp [...] For both years in the POST trials, all treatments, except glyphosate alone, provided 3 ̆e 90...|$|E
