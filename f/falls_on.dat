5|$|The {{watershed}} can {{be divided}} into two hydrologic areas with different infiltration rates. The northern area, comprising about 40percent of the watershed, consists of the Portland Terraces, and the southern consists of the Boring Hills and the Kelso Slope. Most of the rain that <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> the northern area percolates into the ground, and most of the rain that <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> the southern area runs quickly into the creek or its tributaries. Rain that <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> the north generally has a more gradual, longer-lasting effect, sustaining the base flow of the creek during dry periods.|$|E

5|$|The outer {{surfaces}} of cometary nuclei {{have a very}} low albedo, making them among the least reflective objects found in the Solar System. The Giotto space probe found that the nucleus of Halley's Comet reflects about four percent of the light that <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> it, and Deep Space 1 discovered that Comet Borrelly's surface reflects less than 3.0% of the light that <b>falls</b> <b>on</b> it; by comparison, asphalt reflects seven percent. The dark surface material of the nucleus may consist of complex organic compounds. Solar heating drives off lighter volatile compounds, leaving behind larger organic compounds that {{tend to be very}} dark, like tar or crude oil. The low reflectivity of cometary surfaces causes them to absorb the heat that drives their outgassing processes.|$|E

2500|$|To prevent Yom Kippur (10 Tishrei) from <b>falling</b> <b>on</b> a Friday or Sunday, Rosh Hashanah (1 Tishrei) cannot <b>fall</b> <b>on</b> Wednesday or Friday.

This leaves only four days on which Rosh Hashanah can fall: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, which are {{referred}} to as the [...] "four gates". Each day is associated with a number (its order in the week, beginning with Sunday as day 1). Numbers in Hebrew have been traditionally denominated by Hebrew letters. Thus the keviyah uses the letters ה ,ג ,ב and ז (representing 2, 3, 5, and 7, for Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday) to denote the starting day of the year.|$|R
