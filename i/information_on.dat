The main motivation of this work is to control the reproduction of color images on different output devices in order to have the same color feeling, coupling intrinsic <b>informations</b> <b>on</b> the image gamut and output device calibration.

40|$|We {{estimate}} the flux of the GRB neutrino background and compute the event rate at SK and TITAND in the collapsar model, assuming that GRB formation rate {{is proportional to}} the star formation rate. We find that the flux and the event rate depend sensitively on the mass-accretion rate. Although the detection of signals from GRBs seems to be difficult by SK, we find that we can detect them by TITAND (optimistically ∼ 20 events per year in the energy range Eνe ≥ 50 MeV). Therefore, we show that we will obtain the <b>informations</b> <b>on</b> the mass-accretion rate of collapsar by observing the GRB neutrino background, which, in turn, should give us <b>informations</b> <b>on</b> the total explosion energy of GRBs...|$|R
