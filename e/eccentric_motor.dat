40|$|Conducting {{polymers}} are {{a subset}} of materials within the electroactive polymer class that exhibit active mechanical deformations. These deformations induce stresses and strains that allow for conducting polymers {{to be used as}} an actuator for mechanical devices. Incorporation of conducting polymer actuators into mechanical devices requires electrochemical and mechanical characterization of varying polymer sample sizes and their active properties. Of particular interest, is the characterization of macro-length polymer samples, which have yet to be investigated. An understanding of conducting polymer films and their feasibility as an actuator in a mechanical device are required {{for the development of a}} conducting polymer based rotary motor. The conducting polymer, polypyrrole, was studied for its feasibility as an actuator for control surfaces on autonomous underwater vehicles. Enhancements to the actuator's performance were addressed following the feasibility study. The development of an electrochemical dynamic mechanical analyzer provides an instrument for characterization of the polymer's properties over a variety of sample sizes and actuation conditions. Finally, the application of polypyrrole as an actuator and possible enhancements combined with the characterization of macro-length polymers provides the necessary tools to develop a rotary motor. Enhancements to polypyrrole actuators in this study account for an increase in tip force of 350 % and a seven fold increase in achievable strain. (cont.)

The inventive system (10) includes displaceable panels for forming the concrete the are vibrated relative to stationary frames to compact the concrete enabling denser, stronger finished concrete to be formed with lighter weight. Lower maintenance, longer lasting frames. The system (10) broadly includes a pallet (12), a core (14), a jacket (16), and a header (18). The jacket (16) encircles the core (14) and is {{supported on the}} pallet (12) and is operable to mold the outside circumferential surface of the culvert. The jacket (16) includes a plurality of modular sections (20 - 32) and each section includes a stationary frame (34), a displaceable vibratory panel (36), a plurality of spring assemblies (38 - 68) shiftably coupling the panel (36) to the frame (34), and a vibrator (70) coupled to the panel (36) for reciprocating the panel (36) relative to the frame (34).

40|$|Loading can {{dramatically}} {{reduce the}} vibratory displacement and the operating frequency in vibrotactile systems implementations that use an <b>eccentric</b> mass <b>motor,</b> but {{this phenomenon is}} not well modeled or understood. In this work, we derive a dynamic model of this phenomenon and implement a system for measuring stiffness and grip force that {{take advantage of this}} phenomenon. The system is based on a non-interposed sensing approach using an <b>eccentric</b> mass dc <b>motor</b> mounted {{on the outside of the}} index finger. If the device were to be worn as a wearable sensor, it could be embedded in a ring. The basic idea is that a person could wear the ring sensor and through it measure the stiffness and grip force when squeezing various objects, without requiring the ring sensor to actually contact the object. The results show that grip force and muscle stiffness vary with motor velocity (operating frequency) and thus that the measurement of velocity can be used to infer grip force and stiffness. With the validated model, we also developed an optimization routine which computes the best design parameters for inertial load and voltage to maximize the phenomenon. This provided insight into the optimal parameters that should be used in an actual ring sensor design to achieve high performance by attaining a good trade-off between high sensor sensitivity and low level of vibration...|$|R

This paper presents the development and evaluation of a device that provides haptic cues to warn a visually impaired user of low-hanging obstacles during white cane navigation. The Haptic Alerts for Low-hanging Obstacles (HALO) system is a portable and affordable attachment to traditional white canes. By pairing distance data acquired from an ultrasonic range sensor with vibration feedback delivered by an <b>eccentric</b> mass <b>motor,</b> the device aims to alert users of low-hanging obstacles without interfering with the standard functionality of a white cane.

40|$|Stator current {{spectral}} analysis techniques are usually {{used to detect}} rotor faults in induction machines. Magnetic field anomalies in the airgap due to the rotor faults result in characteristic side-band harmonic components in the stator current spectrum, which can be measured as rotor fault signatures. A position-varying load torque oscillation at multiples of the rotational speed, however, has exactly the same effect. Stator current harmonics due to a load torque oscillation often obscure and even overwhelm rotor eccentricity fault detection since the magnitude of load oscillation induced harmonics is usually much larger. Although previous research has suggested some methods to differentiate between these two effects, most of them rely heavily on the accurate estimation of motor parameters. The objective {{of this research is}} to develop a far more practical and computationally efficient method to detect rotor faults effectively {{in the presence of a}} load torque oscillation. A significant advantage of the proposed scheme is that it does not need any knowledge of motor parameters. The normalized negative sequence information induced by a mixed rotor eccentricity in the stator current or terminal voltage space vector spectra, serves as a reliable rotor fault indicator to eliminate load oscillation effects. Detailed airgap magnetic field analysis for an <b>eccentric</b> <b>motor</b> is performed and all machine inductance matrices as well as their derivatives are reformulated accordingly. Careful observation of these inductance matrices provides a fundamental understanding of motor operation characteristics under a fault condition. Simulation results based on both induction motor dynamic model and Maxwell 2 D Finite Element Model demonstrate clearly the existence of the predicted rotor fault indicator. Extensive experimental results also validate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed detection scheme. Ph. D.

40|$|In this dissertation, the {{influence}} of using induction motor in machinery train on rotordynamics is discussed. Two areas are considered ? the use of variable frequency drives (VFDs), which control and drive the induction motor; and the unstable forces due motor eccentricity, which is resulted from motor rotor lateral motion. VFDs ? The dissertation documents fatigue related mechanical failures in VFD motor machinery due to mechanical vibrations excited by drive torque harmonics which are created by PWM switching. Present effort models the coupled system with full electrical system including DC bus, inverter, motor, and an industrial mechanical system including flexible couplings, gearboxes and multiple inertias. The approach extends failure prediction beyond simple occurrence of resonance, to fatigue life evaluation based on Rain-flow algorithm, which is suitable for both steady state and transient startup mechanical response. The use of multilevel inverters is demonstrated having the possibility actually exacerbate resonance and fatigue failure. The model is also compared to an industrial test case, which provides good agreement. Motor eccentricity ? In this dissertation, a MEC modeling method is proposed to calculate both the radial and tangential <b>motor</b> <b>eccentric</b> force. The proposed model is also coupled with the motor electric circuit model to provide capability of transient simulation. FEM (Ansys Maxwell) is used to verify the proposed model. Parametric study is performed on the motor radial and tangential eccentric forces. Also a Jeffcott rotor model is used to study {{the influence}} of the <b>motor</b> <b>eccentric</b> force on mechanical stability. A stability criteria of the bearing damping is calculated. The motor radial and tangential eccentric forces are all curved fitted to catch their nonlinearity, which are used in time domain simulation. Nonlinear motions are observed, including limit cycle and jumping phenomena. The results of this dissertation show that both the use of VFDs and the motor lateral motion (motor eccentricity) can cause severe mechanical vibration problem in a rotating machinery train. Both of these two problems need to be carefully concerned in design stage...|$|R
50|$|Conventional {{and general}} {{design for a}} high {{frequency}} vibrating screen consists of mainframe, screen web, <b>eccentric</b> bock, electric <b>motor,</b> rub spring and coupler. The two most common types of vibrators which induce the high frequency vibrations are hydraulic or electric vibrators, these electric vibrators are either electric motors or solenoids. Common designs for screening decks are either single or double deck. In addition, another feature of high frequency vibrating screens are the static side plates which provide benefits such as smaller support structure, less noise, longer life, and hence less maintenance. In industry, the screens are operated at a tiled angle up till 40 º. The high frequency (1500 - 7200 rpm) and low amplitude (1.2 - 2.0 mm) characteristics leads to the vertical-elliptical movement that rapidly transports oversized particles down the screen. Creating a thin bed of particles, this improves the efficiency and capacity of the screen.|$|R
40|$|While tactile acuity for {{pressure}} {{has been extensively}} investigated, far less is known about acuity for vibrotactile stimulation. Vibrotactile acuity is important however, as such stimulation is used in many applications, including sensory substitution devices. We tested discrimination of vibrotactile stimulation from <b>eccentric</b> rotating mass <b>motors</b> with in-plane vibration. In 3 experiments, we tested gradually decreasing center-to-center (c/c) distances from 30 mm (experiment 1) to 13 mm (experiment 3). Observers judged whether a second vibrating stimulator (‘tactor’) was {{to the left or}} right or in the same place as a first one that came on 250 ms before the onset of the second (with a 50 -ms inter-stimulus interval). The results show that while accuracy tends to decrease the closer the tactors are, discrimination accuracy is still well above chance for the smallest distance, which places the threshold for vibrotactile stimulation well below 13 mm, which is lower than recent estimates. The results cast new light on vibrotactile sensitivity and can furthermore be of use in the design of devices that convey information through vibrotactile stimulation. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

While the primary pathology {{lies in the}} sensory neurons of dt mice, the overt movement disorder suggests motor neurons may also be affected. Here, {{we report on the}} contribution of motor neurons to the pathology in dt 27 J mice. Phenotypic dt 27 J mice display reduced alpha motor neuron cell number and <b>eccentric</b> alpha <b>motor</b> nuclei in the ventral horn of the lumbar L 1 spinal cord region. A dramatic reduction in the total number of motor axons in the ventral root of postnatal day 15 dt 27 J mice was also evident. Moreover, analysis of the trigeminal nerve of the brainstem showed a 2. 4 fold increase in number of degenerating neurons coupled with a decrease in motor neuron number relative to wild type. Aberrant phosphorylation of neurofilaments in the perikaryon region and axonal swellings within the pre-synaptic terminal region of motor neurons were observed. Furthermore, neuromuscular junction staining of dt 27 J mouse extensor digitorum longus and tibialis anterior muscle fibers showed immature endplates and a significant decrease in axon branching compared to wild type littermates. Muscle atrophy was also observed in dt 27 J muscle. Ultrastructure analysis revealed amyelinated motor axons in the ventral root of the spinal nerve, suggesting a possible defect in Schwann cells. Finally, behavioral analysis identified defective motor function in dt 27 J mice. This study reveals neuromuscular defects that likely contribute to the dt 27 J pathology and identifies a critical role for dystonin outside of sensory neurons.

40|$|Muscle damage reduces {{voluntary}} force after eccentric exercise but impaired neural {{drive to}} the muscle may also contribute. To determine whether the delayed-onset muscle soreness, which develops ∼ 1 day after exercise, reduces voluntary activation and to identify the possible site for any reduction, voluntary activation of elbow flexor muscles was examined with both motor cortex and motor nerve stimulation. We measured maximal voluntary isometric torque (MVC), twitch torque, muscle soreness and voluntary activation in eight subjects before, immediately after, 2 h after, 1, 2, 4 and 8 days after <b>eccentric</b> exercise. <b>Motor</b> nerve stimulation and motor cortex stimulation were used to derive twitch torques and measures of voluntary activation. Eccentric exercise immediately reduced the MVC by 38 ± 3 % (mean ±s. d., n = 8). The resting twitch produced by motor nerve stimulation fell by 82 ± 6 %, and the estimated resting twitch by cortical stimulation fell by 47 ± 15 %. While voluntary torque recovered after 8 days, both measures of the resting twitch remained depressed. Muscle tenderness occurred 1 – 2 days after exercise, and pain during contractions on days 1 – 4, but changes in voluntary activation did not follow this time course. Voluntary activation assessed with nerve stimulation fell 19 ± 6 % immediately after exercise but was not different from control values after 2 days. Voluntary activation assessed by motor cortex stimulation was unchanged by eccentric exercise. During MVCs, absolute increments in torque evoked by nerve and cortical stimulation behaved differently. Those to cortical stimulation decreased whereas those to nerve stimulation tended to increase. These findings suggest that reduced voluntary activation contributes to the early force loss after eccentric exercise, {{but that it is}} not due to muscle soreness. The impairment of voluntary activation to nerve stimulation but not motor cortical stimulation suggests that the activation deficit lies in the motor cortex or at a spinal level...|$|R

A fluorescent magnetic bead was attached to single molecules of F(1) and a fluorescent actin filament to F(O) F(1), respectively.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of eccentric muscle damage on recruitment threshold force and repetitive discharge properties of low-threshold motor units. Ten subjects performed four tasks involving isometric contraction of elbow flexors while electromyographic (EMG) data were recorded from human biceps brachii and brachialis muscles. Tasks were 1) maximum voluntary contraction (MVC); 2) constant-force contraction at various submaximal targets; 3) motor unit recruitment threshold task; and 4) minimum motor unit discharge rate task. These tasks were performed on three separate days before, immediately after, and 24 h after eccentric exercise of elbow flexor muscles. MVC force declined (42 %) immediately after exercise and remained depressed (29 %) 24 h later, indicative of muscle damage. Mean motor unit recruitment threshold for biceps brachii was 8. 4 +/- 4. 2 % MVC, (n= 34) before eccentric exercise, and was reduced by 41 % (5. 0 +/- 3. 0 % MVC, n= 34) immediately after and by 39 % (5. 2 +/- 2. 5 % MVC, n= 34) 24 h after exercise. No significant changes in motor unit recruitment threshold were observed in the brachialis muscle. However, for the minimum tonic discharge rate task, motor units in both muscles discharged 11 % faster (10. 8 +/- 2. 0 vs. 9. 7 +/- 1. 7 Hz) immediately after (n= 29) exercise compared with that before (n= 32). The minimum discharge rate variability was greater in brachialis muscle immediately after exercise (13. 8 +/- 3. 1 %) compared with that before (11. 9 +/- 3. 1 %) and 24 h after exercise (11. 7 +/- 2. 4 %). No significant changes in minimum discharge rate variability were observed in the biceps brachii motor units after exercise. These results indicate that muscle damage from <b>eccentric</b> exercise alters <b>motor</b> unit recruitment thresholds for >or= 24 h, but the effect is not the same in the different elbow flexor muscles.

40|$|Nowadays, the {{interest}} in the synchronous reluctance machines is growing up due to their several merits in comparison to other machine types. These machines offer high torque density {{with respect to the}} induction machines. Their torque density is slightly lower than permanent magnet synchronous machines even though the lower performance is compensated by a much cheaper rotor. Since synchronous reluctance machines do not induce voltage when the stator is not supplied, there are not short circuit currents and braking torques due to the electrical faults, e. g. they have high fault tolerant capability. In addition, synchronous reluctance machine has a robust structure, and a wide constant power speed range. For these aforementioned reasons, these machines are employed in several applications. However, there is a prominent defect of this kind of machines which is the low power factor. This defect is addressed by assisting the motor by permanent magnets within the flux barriers of the rotor leading to the permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motor. In addition, these kinds of machines has high torque ripple. This is due to the high harmonic content in the magneto motive force which interacts with the rotor anisotropy. Several approaches are proposed to reduce the torque ripple, such as: (a) using skewed rotor, (b) adopting two different flux-barrier geometries in the same lamination, i. e., asymmetric rotor, (c) using equally spaced the flux-barrier ends along the rotor periphery, and (d) optimization approaches were applied to smooth the torque. The synchronous reluctance machine is becoming of great interest in the last years, due to two key reasons: (i) the increase of rare earth permanent magnet cost and (ii) the increasing request of high-efficiency machines. Therefore, the reluctance motor and the ferrite permanent assisted reluctance motor are becoming competitors of both surface-mounted permanent magnet machines and induction machines in many applications. Such motors are also becoming particularly interesting when the control is based on the sensor-less rotor position detection. Even if there is a great interest in this kind of machines, there is a few work about the analytical design of their rotor, e. g. about how to select the end barrier angles, designing the iron ribs, and designing the permanent magnet robust towards the demagnetization. In the majority of the cases the reluctance machine is analyzed by using finite element analysis. The results are precise and useful for achieving a specific geometry to be prototyped, but they refer to that particular solution and they lose generality. In other words, it is difficult to find general rules to design reluctance machines, since the analysis approach is focused on a single objective. During the manufacturing process, there are some manufacturing imprecision, such as mass unbalance, bearing tolerance, shaft bow, and etc., cause eccentricity fault. Eccentricity may cause magnetic and dynamic problems with additional vibrations, noises, and torque pulsations. Although the eccentricity faults in induction and permanent magnet motors are extensively investigated, there are a few publications on synchronous reluctance machines with eccentricity. It is important to study the effect of rotor eccentricity on these machines because of their high anisotropy and critical iron parts in the rotor (iron ribs). For the aim of designing the iron ribs thicknesses, the unbalanced magnetic force acting on theses ribs should be accurately estimated. Main contribution of the thesis This thesis aims to give an useful analytical approach for reaching a preliminary geometry of both synchronous reluctance and permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motors, as starting point for a successive optimization. For more accurate design of the rotor iron ribs, the electro-magnetic force acting on the rotor, in different rotor eccentricity cases, are analytically computed. In addition, a comparative studies (analytically and FE) between the synchronous reluctance, permanent magnet assisted, and surface mounted permanent magnet machines, in different eccentricity cases, is carried out. Therefore, this thesis is divided into four main parts. At the first part, an analytical model based on the magnetic equivalent lumped network of the reluctance motor is discussed. This model studies the magnetic performance of the concentric synchronous reluctance motor. Then, this analytical model is adopted in order to study the impact of different eccentricity scenarios (static and dynamic eccentricity) on the reluctance motor. Different stator windings configurations (distributed and concentrated windings) and different rotor geometries (symmetric and asymmetric rotor) are considered. After that, the eccentric synchronous reluctance machine is compared with the eccentric permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance machine. The impact of the barrier dimensions, the rotor geometry, and the permanent magnet type is highlighted in this comparison. Furthermore, an analytical comparison between the reluctance motor and the surface mounted permanent magnet motor is carried out in different cases of eccentricity. The axial non uniform displacement of the rotor axis from the stator axis, at one end and both ends of the axis, are involved in this analytical comparison. The second part aims to achieve more realistic estimation of the electromagnetic forces acting on the rotor by considering the effect of stator slots and the magnetic voltage drop due to the actual B-H curve of the motor iron. The analytical model is developed for both eccentric and concentric synchronous reluctance motor. Then, an experimental validation of the analytical and FE analysis is carried out. At the third part, an analytical approach for designing the permanent magnet of the permanent magnet assisted reluctance motor is proposed. The width and the thickness are selected so as to achieve the desired no-load air-gap flux density and resist the demagnetization under the desired loading conditions, respectively. Both complete and simplified analytical analyses are discussed. In addition, the analytical approach is presented in both cases of neglecting and considering the rotor iron ribs. Then, from the previously mentioned three parts of this thesis, a rapid multi-objectives analytical approach is proposed to achieve the initial design of the synchronous reluctance and permanent magnet assisted synchronous reluctance motors. Finally, at the fourth part, a graphical user interface application for concentric and <b>eccentric</b> synchronous reluctance <b>motor</b> is developed. This application estimates stator and rotor scalar magnetic potential, air-gap flux density, electromagnetic torque, magnetic force acting on the rotor. The input parameters of this application are - the geometrical data of the stator and rotor, - the electric loading (kA/m), the electric load angle in (electric degree), - the rotor geometry type, e. g., symmetric or asymmetric rotor geometry, - number of flux-barriers per rotor pole, - eccentricity type or no eccentricity, e. g., healthy case, - the eccentricity value. Then, the user can run the application to estimate the magnetic performance of both concentric and <b>eccentric</b> synchronous reluctance <b>motor.</b> ...|$|R
