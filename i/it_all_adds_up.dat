2500|$|David Wilson, {{editor and}} co-creator of the website Wilson & Alroys' Record Reviews, stated that [...] "By 2009, reggaeton had largely run its course, and Vico C wisely retrenched toward the minimalist Latin-ized hip hop of the Xplosión era (title track, with melodramatic but {{effective}} synth strings). There's nothing shockingly innovative like his first successes, {{but by now}} he's experienced enough {{to work with a}} limited palette while still giving each track an individual affect ('Prueba De Farmacia', which somehow manages not to be sappy; the salsified 'Aqui La Que Fallo Fue Usted'). Another of Vico C's strengths is his ability to vary vocal tone and timbre to suit a song: playfully prickly on 'Payasito'; tender on 'Moriré'; commanding on the upbraiding 'Polvora'. He still has an unfortunate tendency to moralize ('El Corazón Se Pone Bruto'; 'Angelina'), but his skills are equally undimmed by time, and though no one tune is a socks-rocker, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>adds</b> <b>up</b> to a satisfying whole."

500|$|In April 2015, Ruffalo said Universal {{holding the}} {{distribution}} rights to Hulk films {{may be an}} obstacle to releasing a future Hulk standalone film, and reiterated this in October 2015, and July 2017.

According to The Hollywood Reporter, a potential reason why Marvel has not reacquired the film distribution rights to the Hulk as they did with Paramount Pictures for the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America films is because Universal holds the theme park rights to several Marvel characters that Marvel's parent company Disney wants for its own theme parks. In December, Ruffalo stated that the strained relationship between Marvel and Universal may be another obstacle to releasing a future standalone Hulk film.

50|$|Porter’s books give {{techniques}} for getting {{a handle on}} the possible average profitability of an industry over time. The analysis of these forces is the base for estimating a firm’s relative position and competitive advantage. In any industry, the sustained average profitability of competitors varies widely. The problem is to determine how a business can outperform the industry average and attain a sustainable competitive advantage. It is possible that the answer lies in information technology together with good management. Porter claims that the principal types of competitive advantage are low cost producer, differentiation, and focus. A firm has a competitive advantage if it is able to deliver its product or service at a lower cost than its competitors. If the quality of its product is satisfactory, this will translate into higher margins and higher returns. Another advantage is gained if the firm is able to differentiate itself in some way. Differentiation leads to offering something that is both unique and is desired, and translates into a premium price. Again, this will lead to higher margins and superior performance. It seems that two types of competitive advantage, lower cost and differentiation, are mutually exclusive. To get lower cost, you sacrifice uniqueness. To get a premium price, there must be extra cost involved in the process. To be a superior performer, however, you must go for competitive advantage in either cost or differentiation. Another point of Porter’s is that competitive advantage is gained through a strategy based on scope. It is necessary to look at the breadth of a firm’s activities, and narrow the competitive scope to gain focus in either an industry segment, a geographic area, a customer type, and so on. Competitive advantage is most readily gained by defining the competitive scope in which the firm is operating, and concentrating on it. Based on these ideas of type and scope, Porter gives a useful tool for analysis which he calls the value chain. This value chain gives a framework on which a useful analysis can be hung. The basic notion is that to understand competitive advantage in any firm, one cannot look at the firm as a whole. It is necessary to identify the specific activities which the firm performs to do business. Each firm is a collection of the things that <b>it</b> does that <b>all</b> <b>add</b> <b>up</b> to the product being delivered to the customer. These activities are numerous and are unique to every industry, but it is only in these activities where cost advantage or differentiation can be gained. The basic lis that the firm’s activities can be divided into nine generic types. Five are the primary activities, which are the activities that create the product, market it and deliver it; four are the support activities that cross between the primary activities.|$|R
