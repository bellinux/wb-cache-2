Instead, they can go through an <b>e-gate</b> by scanning their e-passport and finger(s) all by themselves with the whole process taking only 10 seconds at most. Entry information and their facial image will be stored automatically in a database. (No entry stamps will be left in their e-passport, but any passport holder could request gratis entry or exit records.) E-gates are not only used for fast entry for Chinese e-passport holders, but they have also [...] been tested for fast-exit in Beijing Capital Airport Terminal 2.

40|$|AbstractA fast {{automated}} biometric solution {{has been}} proposed to satisfy the future border control needs of airports resulting from the rapid {{growth in the number}} of passengers worldwide. Automated border control (ABC) systems handle the problems caused by this growth, such as congestion at electronic gates (<b>e-gates)</b> or delays in the planned arrival schedules. Different modalities, such as face, fingerprint, or iris recognition, will be used in most of the ABC systems located at airports in the European/Schengen areas. Because facial recognition is the modality that travelers consider most acceptable, it was decided to include this modality in all second generation passports. Face recognition systems, installed in small kiosks inside the <b>e-gates,</b> require high quality facial images to allow high performance and efficiency. Accurate face recognition algorithms, which should be invariant to non-idealities, such as changes in pose and expression, occlusions, and changes in lighting, are also required for these systems. In this paper, a review of the most important face recognition algorithms described in the literature that are invariant to these non-idealities and that can be used in ABC <b>e-gates</b> is presented. A comparative analysis of the most common ABC <b>e-gates</b> located at the different airports is provided. In addition, the results of an experimental evaluation of a face recognition system when halogen, white LEDs, near infra-red, or fluorescence illumination was used, which was conducted in order to determine which type of illumination is optimal for use in ABC <b>e-gates,</b> are presented. To conclude, improvements that could be implemented in the near future in ABC face recognition systems are described...|$|R

40|$|Throughout Europe {{airports}} are increasingly installing automated border control (ABC) technologies {{as they are}} expected to improve security, streamline the traveling process, and facilitate better passenger experience. Although these <b>e-gates</b> have been in use for years, they are still underutilized by travellers. This might be partly due to problems with the systems’ usability. This paper presents a usability analysis of ABC <b>e-gates</b> at two large North-European international airports and compares their ease of use.

50|$|Holders of Chinese {{biometric}} Passports {{are eligible}} to use the Self-Service Immigration System, or e-Gates, when arriving from destinations outside Mainland China. E-Gates are located throughout numerous international airports in Mainland China (including the four busiest international gateways: Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai Pudong International Airport, Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport and Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport) as well as land border crossing checkpoints in Shenzhen and Zhuhai. In order to use the <b>e-Gate,</b> they must hold biometric passports with their fingerprint data pre-recorded on the biometric chip. If their biometric passports do not contain fingerprint data, they must first register with China Immigration Inspection (CII) at land border checkpoints or international airports to be eligible.|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} reasons why {{passengers}} are unable or reluctant to use self-service <b>e-gate</b> systems. In order for designers to build better systems with higher uptake by end-users {{they need to have}} a more thorough understanding of the non-users.

40|$|The {{exopolysaccharide}} alginate is {{an important}} component of biofilms produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a major pathogen that contributes to the demise of cystic fibrosis patients. Alginate exits the cell via the outer membrane porin AlgE. X-ray structures of several AlgE crystal forms are reported here. Whilst all share a common -barrel constitu- tion, they differ in the degree to which loops L 2 and T 8 are ordered. L 2 and T 8 have been identified as an extracellular gate (<b>E-gate)</b> and a periplasmic gate (P-gate), respectively, that reside on either side of an alginate-selectivity pore located midway through AlgE. Passage of alginate across the membrane is proposed to be regulated by the sequential opening and closing of the two gates. In one crystal form, the selectivity pore contains a bound citrate. Because citrate mimics the uronate monomers of alginate, its location is taken to highlight a route through AlgE taken by alginate as it crosses the pore. Docking and molecular-dynamics simula- tions support and extend the proposed transport mechanism. Specifically, the P-gate and <b>E-gate</b> are flexible and move between open and closed states. Citrate can leave the selectivity pore bidirectionally. Alginate docks stably in a linear conformation through the open pore. To translate across the pore, a force is required that presumably is provided by the alginate-synthesis machinery. Accessing the open pore is facilitated by complex formation between AlgE and the periplasmic protein AlgK. Alginate can thread through a continuous pore in the complex, suggesting that AlgK pre-orients newly synthesized exopolysaccharide for delivery to AlgE...|$|E
40|$|AB Electrolux is {{a company}} that focuses on {{innovative}} products and collaborationamongst others. Today, they are using their intranet “E-gate” to enhance collaboration. AB Electrolux has recently introduced new Web 2. 0 social media technology on <b>E-gate.</b> In contemporary business, it seems like social media and innovations are hot topics; butit is not easy, to implement social media, create innovations, and also make use of it inan organisation. In a majority of organisations are these matters often overrepresented. In organisation different policies, rules, guidelines and employees are involved duringchanges, and this is aiding organisations to establish how social media features canenhance and promote innovation. Nowadays, innovation is significant to organisations, especially when it comes togain advantages toward competitors or when trying to advance in the marketplace. Inthis thesis the collected information is objectively applied. This, in order to gainqualitative knowledge about subjects of interest such as; cultural issues, knowledgemanagement and the socio-technical perspective – because these areas could beconsidered to have a huge effect and impact on innovation. Further it could have aneffect on how innovation emerges in organisations. This is of importance especially inareas such as knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer. The results are showing: Organisational culture and knowledge management plays acrucial and important part of innovation. These areas must be considered iforganisations are implementing or using new technology. It is also to be recommendedwhen organisations are trying to enhance the pace of innovations. In this thesis I havealso constructed a model that illustrates how an organisation could create an innovativeatmosphere, along with a socio-technical perspective...|$|E
50|$|On 19 December 2010, a new Arrival Terminal {{was opened}} in the western apron, in {{the site of the}} former Asian Games {{temporary}} terminal. The terminal had a capacity of 2,770 passengers per hour. The 32000 m2 Arrivals Terminal replaced the arrivals hall of what became the Departure and Transfer Terminal. The Arrivals Terminal had 22 immigration counters, eight <b>e-gates,</b> eight baggage carousels, 36 concierge desks for hotel transfers, car rental and other services, as well as 746 parking spaces. The former arrivals hall was merged with the departing hall, adding extra valuable space and capacity to the airport. These changes were part of the multimillion-dollar expansion of Doha Airport to cope with the increasing traffic of Qatar Airways and other airlines before the new Hamad International Airport opened in 2014.|$|R
50|$|This {{division}} historically lies at {{the heart}} of the company. Morpho is active in biometrics, having developed technologies based on fingerprint, vein, facial and iris recognition as Automated Biometric Identification Systems (ABIS), Finger on the Fly which was renamed MorphoWave (technology that reads fingerprints on a moving hand), <b>e-gates,</b> fast DNA matching tools etc. These devices are mainly employed in domains such as government identity, public security and criminal identification. Indeed, Morpho supplies government security agencies over the world, including FBI, Interpol, NYPD. Morpho's solutions analyse biometric evidence and data to assist police forces from the crime scene to the courthouse, for instance hand-held terminals in the field to perform identity checks, facial recognition in live video streams or booking stations for enrollment at police stations.They also provided secure biometric access control, focused on a series of multi-biometric access control devices, which rely on fingerprint, multi-modal (combination of finger vein and fingerprint biometrics) and facial identification techniques.|$|R
