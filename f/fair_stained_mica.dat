40|$|Four {{distinct}} {{types of}} glial cell were {{recognized in the}} corpus callosum of young postnatal mice: the early glioblast; the small glioblast; the large glioblast; and the young astrocyte. As well as these, mature microglia could be recognized from birth. In semithin, toluidine blue stained sections early glioblasts had large, <b>fair</b> to moderately <b>stained</b> nuclei, and a thin rim of pale cytoplasm; small glioblasts had small, dark nuclei and a rim of darkly stained cytoplasm; large glioblasts had moderately unevenly stained nuclei and a thin rim of moderately stained cytoplasm; and young astrocytes had fairly small nuclei, moderately stained cytoplasm, and one or more processes, which could usually be seen extending for 5 mum or more from the perikaryon. Differential glial counts using the criteria described above, in conjunction with electron microscopic analysis, suggested that early glioblasts gave rise to small glioblasts and large glioblasts; that small glioblasts gave rise directly to astrocytes, large glioblasts, oligodendrocytes and possibly microglia; that large glioblasts formed oligodendrocytes only, and might be immature light oligodendrocytes; and {{that part of the}} microglial population might arise from vascular pericytes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the clinical {{significance of the}} expression of MHC class I chain-related gene A (MICA) in patients with advanced {{non-small cell lung cancer}} and explore the relationship between MICA expression and the efficacy of cytokine-induced killer cell (CIK) therapy for treating advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: We obtained data on 222 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer, including data on MICA expression, age, gender, ECOG score, pathological type, stage, treatment history (including 38 patients who were given autologous CIK cell infusion), and overall survival (OS). MICA expression in lung cancer tissue was evaluated by immunohistochemical <b>staining.</b> Analyses of <b>MICA</b> expression, and CIK therapy association with survival outcomes were performed using Cox proportional models, Kaplan-Meier methods, and the log-rank test. Result: s MICA was expressed in both membrane and cytoplasm. MICA expression correlated with the stage of lung cancer, ECOG score, gender and age. Multivariate COX regression analysis showed that the expression of MICA was an independent prognostic factor of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (p = 0. 002). In subgroup analysis, we divided the 222 patients into CIK and control groups. In the CIK group, the medium OS (mOS) of patients with a high expression of MICA was longer than in those with low expression of MICA (27 months vs. 13 months). In the control group, the mOS in patients with a high expression of MICA was shorter than in patients with low MICA expression (9 months vs. 18 months). COX regressio...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Celiac {{disease is}} a {{systemic}} immune disease induced by gluten which causes a malabsorption syndrome, but also manifests with many symptoms in almost all organ systems. The prevalence is about 1 % in the Caucasian population. MICA, an atypical MHC class I molecule, {{plays an important role}} in disease pathogenesis by acting as a ligand for intraepithelial lymphocytes, which in celiac disease infiltrate small intestine epithelium leading to cell lysis and thereby causing villous atrophy typical of the disease. There are four MICA alleles, collectively, MICA A 5. 1 alleles, carrying a guanine insertion leading to a truncation of the protein within the transmembrane domain. In MDCK cell lines this results in sorting of MICA to the apical instead of the basolateral cellular membrane. Methods: By DNA sequencing, celiac disease patients and healthy controls were tested for the presence of MICA A 5. 1 alleles. Patients were interviewed to analyze the disease’s clinical presentation in each individual; the results were correlated with the respected MICA genotype. MICA localization in duodenal biopsies was shown by immunohistochemistry staining. Subcellular localization of MICA and MICB, a protein almost homologue to MICA in structure and sequence, was analyzed in human duodenal biopsies and Caco- 2 cell lines by immunofluorescence staining. Western blot analysis was performed in celiac disease and refractory celiac disease patients and in controls to compare MICA/B protein levels. Results: MICA alleles A 5. 1 are significantly higher in patients with celiac disease than in controls. Immunohistochemistry showed an apical sorting of MICA in patients carrying MICA A 5. 1. There was no indication that apical MIC-A does affect clinical presentation of the disease. An apical immunofluorescence <b>staining</b> of <b>MICA</b> and MICB together was found in all human duodenal biopsy samples, in both MICA A 5. 1 positive and negative patients, and co-localized with alkaline phosphatase, rab 3 b-positive vesicles and IgA-containing structures. Furthermore, MICA A 5. 1 negative Caco- 2 -cells showed this apical staining signal as well; in this case immunofluorescence revealed a co-localization of MICA/B not only with alkaline phosphatase, but with lipid rafts. The cell compartment holding intracellular MICA/B could not be identified. Western blot analysis showed higher expression levels of MICA/B in refractory celiac disease patients compared with controls only. An amount of MICA/B with a molecular weight of 38 kDa instead of 42 kDa was found in both MICA A 5. 1 positive and negative samples, regardless of MICA genotype. Conclusion: MICA A 5. 1 alleles appear to cause MICA shifting in the apical membrane without affecting clinical presentation in celiac disease. Apical localization of MICA and MICB and their co-localization with secretory structures and lipid rafts observed in all samples indicate an additional function of MICA/B other than acting as a ligand only. The amount of 38 kDa-MICA/B might suggest posttranslational modification of MICA/B proteins. In order to test these hypotheses, further functional studies, for example luminal secretion of MICA/B, have to be performed...|$|R
