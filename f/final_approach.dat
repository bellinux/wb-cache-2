5|$|Japan Airlines Flight 350, a DC-8, {{crashed in}} 1982 {{short of the}} runway in Tokyo, after the mentally ill captain {{attempted}} suicide during the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> phase of the flight, by putting the inboard engines into reverse thrust. Of the 174 people aboard, 24 died.|$|E
5|$|Kulwicki {{died in an}} {{airplane}} crash on Thursday April 1, 1993. He was returning from an appearance at the Knoxville Hooters in a Hooters corporate plane on a short flight across Tennessee before the Sunday spring race at Bristol. The plane slowed and crashed just before <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> at Tri-Cities Regional Airport near Blountville. The National Transportation Safety Board attributed the crash to the pilot's failure to use the airplane's anti-ice system to clear ice from the engine inlet system.|$|E
5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> and for landing, and the pilot was to retract them before taxiing.|$|E

50|$|Converging runway display aid (CRDA) enables {{approach}} controllers to run two <b>final</b> <b>approaches</b> that intersect {{and make}} sure that go arounds are minimized.|$|R
50|$|The {{underground}} cable route from Brownhill to Pakuranga is 11 km long, and follows Brownhill Road, Sandstone Road and Caldwells Road, weaving through the suburban streets of Dannemora to Te Irirangi Drive until the <b>final</b> <b>approaches</b> to Pakuranga substation.|$|R
5|$|When landing, {{wind shear}} {{is also a}} hazard, {{particularly}} when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E
5|$|ASquadron 4RTR and the 1st Durham Light Infantry (1DLI) {{continued}} the advance toward Fort Capuzzo. Concealed in hull down positions behind a ridge near the fort were 20–30 German tanks, supported by anti tank guns. These engaged ASquadron, disabling five tanks, but {{were forced to}} withdraw as the squadron pressed its attack. On the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> to Fort Capuzzo, contact was lost between 4RTR's tanks and 1DLI's leading CCompany, and {{the attack on the}} fort began without armoured support. The fort was vigorously defended, and it was not until just before midday that CCompany, reunited with ASquadron 4RTR and reinforced by A and BCompanies 1DLI, eventually took the position. DCompany 1DLI—which had been in reserve during the attack—then made a wide left hook to capture a small landing ground {{to the north of the}} fort.|$|E
5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was cleared for the VOR/DME-C {{instrument}} approach to the airport, whereupon it proceeded to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> to the runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>final</b> must be <b>approached</b> by step. If the <b>final</b> is <b>approached</b> from below, {{then the}} leading tone must {{be raised in}} a minor key (Dorian, Hypodorian, Aeolian, Hypoaeolian), but not in Phrygian or Hypophrygian mode. Thus, in the Dorian mode on D, a C is {{necessary}} at the cadence.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} {{occurred at}} the airfield itself, immediately after takeoff, during the <b>final</b> landing <b>approach,</b> and/or during an attempted go-around: ...|$|R
5000|$|On , a Piper PA-28 {{registered}} as N943R {{collided with a}} Cessna 150 (N63137) while the two aircraft were making their <b>final</b> <b>approaches</b> to parallel runways. The aircraft failed to maintain visual separation and the low-wing Piper overtook the high-wing Cessna from behind and above. The Piper's control cables were severed by the Cessna's propeller and it crashed, killing both the student pilot and flight instructor. The Cessna made a forced landing, and both occupants survived.|$|R
5|$|Herodotus recounts that, {{according}} to the Athenians, as the battle began the Corinthians hoisted their sails and began sailing away from the battle, northwards up the straits. However, {{he also says that}} other Greeks denied this story. If this did in fact occur, one possible interpretation is that these ships had been a decoy sent to reconnoitre the northern exit from the straits, in case the arrival of the encircling Egyptian detachment was imminent (if indeed this also occurred). Another possibility (not exclusive of the former) is that the departure of the Corinthians triggered the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> of the Persians, suggesting as it did that the Allied fleet was disintegrating. At any rate, if they indeed ever left, the Corinthians soon returned to the battle.|$|E
5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR {{instrument}} approach procedure, <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on ground speed), a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E
5|$|On 6 November 1945, a Fireball of VF-41 {{became the}} first {{aircraft}} to land under jet power on an aircraft carrier, albeit without prior planning. After the radial engine of an FR-1 failed on <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> to the escort carrier , the pilot managed to start the jet engine and land, barely catching the last arrestor wire before hitting the ship's crash barrier. The squadron was attempting to qualify its pilots for carrier operations during this time, but only 14 of its 22 pilots made the six required takeoffs and landings. A number of accidents occurred when the nose gear failed on landing, but the pilots were at least partly responsible as they were slamming the nose gear onto the deck after landing on the main gear.|$|E
50|$|The ships {{made their}} <b>final</b> <b>approaches</b> through the western islands off Okinawa and arrived off the beachhead by midday. Light enemy {{aircraft}} activity greeted the initial forces — activity that would, in time, become heavy and nearly ceaseless. Between 1 and 4 April, the ship went to general quarters numerous {{times during the}} many air raid alerts caused by enemy planes in the vicinity. William C. Cole downed one plane and assisted in downing two others.|$|R
2500|$|The <b>final</b> MTM <b>approach</b> was finalised. Initial {{costs and}} timing for the Coalition NBN were [...] of public funding to {{construct}} by 2019.|$|R
5000|$|At 14:10:43, {{the crew}} {{contacted}} Tower and reported [...] "Gromov 9675, on landi... turning to <b>final,</b> 400, <b>approaching,</b> continuing approach". This was the crew's final transmission.|$|R
5|$|On May 9, 1987, {{improperly}} assembled bearings in Il-62M engine number 2 on LOT Polish Airlines Flight 5055 overheated {{and exploded}} during cruise over {{the village of}} Lipinki, causing the shaft to break in two; this caused the low-pressure turbine disc to spin to enormous speeds and disintegrate, damaging engine number 1 and cutting the control pushers. The crew managed to return to Warsaw, using nothing but trim tabs to control the crippled aircraft, but on the <b>final</b> <b>approach,</b> the trim controlling links burned and the crew completely lost control over the aircraft. Soon after, it crashed {{on the outskirts of}} Warsaw; all 183 on board perished. Had the plane stayed airborne for 40 seconds more, it {{would have been able to}} reach the runway.|$|E
5|$|One {{issue that}} led to {{accidents}} with the CFM56-3C engine was the failure of fan blades. This mode of failure led to the Kegworth air disaster in 1989, which killed 47 people and injured 74 more. After the fan blade failed, the pilots mistakenly shut down the wrong engine, resulting in the damaged engine failing completely when powered up for the <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b> Following the Kegworth accident, CFM56 engines fitted to a Dan-Air 737-400 and a British Midland 737-400 suffered fan blade failures under similar conditions; neither incident resulted in a crash or injuries. After the second incident, the 737-400 fleet was grounded.|$|E
5|$|Serrate {{used the}} Mk. IV {{equipment}} for reception and display, replacing only the receiver unit. This could be switched {{in or out}} of the circuit from the cockpit, which turned off the transmitter as well. In a typical interception, the radar operator would use Serrate to track the German fighter, using the directional cues from the displays to direct the pilot on an intercept course. Range was not supplied, but the operator could make a rough estimate by observing the signal strength and the way the signals changed as the fighter maneuvered. After following Serrate to an estimated range of , the fighter's own radar would be turned on for the <b>final</b> <b>approach.</b>|$|E
2500|$|After {{entering}} {{service with}} the US Army, the aircraft received {{the reputation of}} a [...] "" [...] due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. The Marauder had to be flown at exact airspeeds, particularly on <b>final</b> runway <b>approach</b> and when one engine was out. The 150mph (241km/h) speed on short <b>final</b> runway <b>approach</b> was intimidating to pilots who were used to much slower speeds, and whenever they slowed down to speeds below what the manual stated, the aircraft would stall and crash.|$|R
50|$|The convoy then sailed from Fiji in a zigzag course, at a {{speed set}} by the slowest ship. To ensure that the rations on board lasted, the {{soldiers}} now received only two daily meals. On 19 December {{in the vicinity of}} New Caledonia the convoy escort was augmented by HMAS Canberra, HMAS Perth and HMNZS Achilles. On 21 December 1941 land based Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) Hudsons provided anti-submarine screening later to be joined by HMAS Swan and HMAS Warrego for the <b>final</b> <b>approaches</b> to Brisbane.|$|R
50|$|Мutford and Lothingland Hundred {{formed the}} {{north-eastern}} corner of Suffolk. Around five miles (8 km) wide, but fifteen miles (24 km) {{from north to}} south it was bounded by Norfolk to the north and west, and the North Sea to the east, other than the strip of land occupied by Great Yarmouth. Its border with Norfolk was formed by the River Waveney as it bends north on its <b>final</b> <b>approaches</b> to the sea, and Breydon Water. It was separated to the south by the appropriately named Hundred River from the hundreds of Wangford and Blything.|$|R
5|$|The Sutton Wick air crash {{occurred}} on 5 March 1957 when a Blackburn Beverley C Mk 1 heavy transport aircraft, serial number XH117, of 53 Squadron Royal Air Force crashed at Sutton Wick, Drayton, Berkshire, England, following a shut-down of one engine and partial {{loss of power}} on another. Shortly after take-off, No. 1 engine was shut down as a precautionary measure then whilst on <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> back to RAF Abingdon, No. 2 engine {{failed to respond to}} throttle inputs. The aeroplane struck cables and trees 18minutes after lifting off.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} and complex arrangements required {{to support the}} infantry attack from {{the west and the}} mounted attack from the east were completed by 30 October, when these attacking forces moved to positions within a day's march of their deployment. Three divisions of XX Corps were concentrated in position: the 53rd (Welsh) Division at Goz el Geleib, the 60th (London) Division at Esani and the 74th (Yeomanry) Division at Khasif. In preparation for their <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> march, the Civil Service Rifles and the Queen's Westminster Rifles (179th Brigade, 60th Division) were supplied with tea and rum for the following day. In their haversack rations were five onions, a tin of bully beef, a slice of cooked bacon, biscuits and dates.|$|E
5|$|As the {{aircraft}} climbed, No. 1 engine {{on the port}} wing developed a fuel leak. The flight crew responded by shutting down the engine and feathering its propeller. The flight crew declared an emergency and requested a blind approach to RAF Abingdon. The controller alerted emergency services on the ground. A short time later, cockpit instruments alerted the flight crew to a large loss of fuel from No. 2 fuel tank, the second of four such tanks in the port wing. In an effort to stop the leak, the crew de-activated the fuel cocks and boosters for the No. 2 tank, but left them on for the No. 1 tank. As the Beverley turned on to <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> for RAF Abingdon the crew attempted to increase power from the remaining three Bristol Centaurus engines but No. 2 engine – also on the port wing – failed to respond and {{the aircraft}} began to lose speed and height.|$|E
5000|$|After {{entering}} {{service with}} the US Army, the aircraft received {{the reputation of}} a [...] "Widowmaker" [...] due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. The Marauder had to be flown at exact airspeeds, particularly on <b>final</b> runway <b>approach</b> and when one engine was out. The 150 mph (241 km/h) speed on short <b>final</b> runway <b>approach</b> was intimidating to pilots who were used to much slower speeds, and whenever they slowed down to speeds below what the manual stated, the aircraft would stall and crash.|$|R
50|$|The {{major part}} of the line to Engelberg was {{constructed}} by Stansstad-Engelberg Railway (StEB) and opened in 1898. The line ran from Stansstad to Engelberg and, like the Brünig line in its early days, relied on steamship connections {{with the rest of the}} Swiss railway network. Unlike the Brünig line, the StEB line was electrified from its opening, using a three-phase alternating current overhead line supply. It also used the Riggenbach rack system on its <b>final</b> <b>approaches</b> to Engleberg, but with a very steep maximum gradient of 25%.|$|R
50|$|The Winston 500 {{was held}} May 2 at Talladega Superspeedway. Dale Earnhardt won the pole. On the <b>final</b> lap <b>approaching</b> the {{checkered}} flag, Rusty Wallace was spun and flipped end over end.|$|R
5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to know when the enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1964, Kennedy was a {{passenger}} {{in a private}} Aero Commander 680 airplane that was flying in bad weather from Washington to Massachusetts. The plane crashed into an apple orchard in the western Massachusetts town of Southampton on the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> to the Barnes Municipal Airport in Westfield. The pilot and Edward Moss (one of Kennedy's aides) were killed. Kennedy was pulled from the wreckage by fellow Senator Birch Bayh and spent months in a hospital recovering from a severe back injury, a punctured lung, broken ribs and internal bleeding. He suffered chronic back pain {{for the rest of}} his life as a result of the accident. Kennedy took advantage of his long convalescence to meet with academics and study issues more closely, and the hospital experience triggered his lifelong interest in the provision of health care services. His wife Joan did the campaigning for him in the regular 1964 U.S. Senate election in Massachusetts, and he defeated his Republican opponent by a three-to-one margin.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the <b>final</b> <b>approach</b> towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they got a good look before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.|$|E
5000|$|Through {{the school}} year ending in 2005, WNS was Westchester Neighborhood School, located in south Westchester {{directly}} under the <b>final</b> <b>approaches</b> of aircraft landing at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), hence the [...] "Jets" [...] nickname used by the school's athletic teams. In September 2005 classes resumed in a vastly improved 50000 sq ft facility in Playa Vista. WNS added a second building to its campus in 2010 featuring additional space for performing arts, spanish, and choral music. The school's third campus building with provide 26,000 additional will instructional space for the preschool, a full-sized gymnasium, and middle school STEAM Academic Complex.|$|R
50|$|Another horror {{start for}} the Warriors in 2013 as they win just 2 of their opening 10 games. The Warriors came back into finals {{contention}} winning 7 games out of 8 including a 56-18 win against the Brisbane Broncos in Brisbane. As <b>finals</b> <b>approached</b> the Warriors ended with just 2 wins from their remaining 6 games to see them finish the season 11th. In Round 10, on the 18th May the Warriors lost 6-62 to the Penrith Panthers which was their largest ever loss in the club's history. Captain Simon Mannering won the club's Player {{of the year and}} Ngani Laumape won Rookie of the year.|$|R
40|$|Several {{guidance}} and control system {{research and development}} activities aimed at improving the operational capabilities of commercial aircraft in the terminal area are described. The {{guidance and}} control systems {{have been designed to}} improve the capacity and efficiency of terminal area operations, enhance the approach and landing capability of aircraft in adverse weather conditions, and reduce the impact of aircraft noise perceived on the ground. Specific performance features include the ability to capture and track steep glideslopes, use short <b>final</b> <b>approaches,</b> perform flares with reduced longitu-dinal touchdown dispersion and execute high speed runway rollout and turnoff. Results obtained from simulation studies or flight tests are shown for each of the algorithms...|$|R
