5000|$|Beastly Tales is a 1991 {{collection}} of ten fables in poetry written by Vikram Seth (UK , also US [...] ).Its full title is Beastly Tales from Here and There and, in the introduction, Seth states"the first two come <b>from</b> India, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two <b>from</b> China, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two <b>from</b> Greece, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ukraine. The final two came directly to me <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Land of Gup".Seth's sense of humour is exemplified by his retelling of the well-known fable of The Hare and The Tortoise (p.43). In his version the loser, being a celebrity, is fêted {{and the winner}} ignored.|$|R

5|$|Emma's ghost {{appears to}} Craven {{and tells him}} {{of a time when}} black flowers grew, warming the Earth and {{preventing}} life from becoming extinct.

Craven goes to dissuade Jedburgh <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> step in his plan, which is to cause a nuclear explosion in Scotland {{with the rest of the}} plutonium. He succeeds, though the secret service follow him and kill Jedburgh. Craven, like Jedburgh and Grogan fatally exposed to radiation, wanders into the mountains to die, calling Emma's name. On the mountains, as Emma predicted, the black flowers are growing, foreshadowing the planet's war against humanity.|$|E

Rajoelina expressed support for Edgar Razafindravahy, interim mayor of Antananarivo and the official candidate of the TGV party among several other party candidates, and declared his intention to run in the 2018 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|At the 2009 Wimbledon Championships, {{his poor}} grass-court form {{from the past}} continued, as {{he went down to}} unseeded Lleyton Hewitt in the second round. In the Davis Cup quarter-final against the Czech Republic, del Potro won his matches against Ivo Minář and Berdych in {{straight}} sets, but Argentina still lost the tie 2–3, eliminating them from the competition. A few weeks later, he defeated Hewitt and Fernando González en route to the Washington final. He successfully defended his title against top-seeded Wimbledon finalist Andy Roddick to win his second tournament of the year and become the first player since Andre Agassi to win back-to-back Washington titles. Del Potro played the following week at the Masters 1000 in Montreal, where he was seeded sixth, defeating world No. 2 Nadal in the quarterfinals, his second win in a row over Nadal. He then defeated Roddick in the semifinals, saving a match point, to advance to his first Masters 1000 final, and to improve his head-to-head record against Roddick to 3–0. In the final, he lost against Murray in three sets. He later withdrew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> Masters 1000 event in Cincinnati due to fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Four matches {{followed}} the MCC fixture before the First Test at Trent Bridge. McCool was rested {{for the first}} of these against Lancashire at Manchester, a rain-affected draw that was Australia's first non-victory of the season. He returned for the following match against Nottinghamshire, which was drawn, but had little success, taking a total of 0/68. He failed to maximise his promotion to No. 4, making only 17 as Australia scored 400 in their only innings. McCool did not get any more opportunities to push for selection, as he was rested <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two matches against Hampshire and Sussex. Australia won the former by eight wickets after conceding a first innings lead {{for the first time on}} the tour, before winning the second by an innings by 325 runs.|$|E
5|$|Hill's Test career {{ended in}} {{controversy}} amid another {{dispute with the}} Board of Control. He was once again appointed captain of the Australian team against an English side captained by Johnny Douglas in 1911–12. The English team included bowlers of the calibre of Barnes and Frank Foster and, after losing the first Test in Sydney, won all four remaining Tests to secure the Ashes. Hill had a lean season with the bat, managing 274runs {{at an average of}} 27.40. The England bowlers were clearly superior to the Australian batsmen; Trumper was the only Australian to score a century during the Tests. While this series took place, the Board of Control made plans to usurp the commonly accepted right of the players to appoint the team manager when touring England. In response, a group of senior players, including Hill, threatened to withdraw <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> tour, to take place in 1912, unless their choice, Frank Laver, was appointed.|$|E

5|$|In January 2007, Asashōryū {{posted a}} 14–1 record, his fourth {{straight}} championship since returning from injury, {{and became the}} fifth man to win twenty career championships. In March, he dropped his first two bouts but then won thirteen in a row for a 13–2 score. However, this {{was not enough to}} win the title—he lost a playoff {{for the first time in}} his career, to fellow Mongolian Hakuhō. In May he turned in a below par 10–5 record, losing to all four ōzeki and maegashira Aminishiki (although he appeared to be carrying an injury). Hakuhō won this tournament as well and was promoted to yokozuna immediately afterwards. Asashōryū had been the sole yokozuna for a total of 21 tournaments since the retirement of Musashimaru in November 2003 – the longest period of time in sumo history. In July he lost to Aminishiki once again on the opening day but rallied to win the next fourteen bouts, taking his 21st title with a 14–1 record. He was suspended by the Sumo Association <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> two tournaments (see below).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to level keys, every level has one Primagen Key. The six Primagen Keys unlock {{the gate to}} the final boss in the hub area and require the player to use talismans to collect them. Talismans grant Turok special powers, such as allowing him to jump long distances or walk over lava. To use the power of a talisman, the player must collect a feather in a level and then take it to the talisman chamber from that level. There are five talismans in the game and every level, except for the first one, features a feather and a talisman chamber. The Primagen key from one particular level usually requires the player to use the talisman <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> level, except for the Primagen key from the last level, which requires the player to use four talismans. Therefore, the player needs to re-enter some levels more than once to collect all Primagen keys and complete the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning hours, marine {{biologist}} Doc is already at work in his one-man Western Biological Laboratory, getting an order of starfish ready to be shipped to a university. His unintelligent friend Hazel (a man) comes in to chat with him ("All Kinds of People"). Millicent, a wealthy young lady, enters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> room, where she has been spending (part of) the night with Doc. Mac, another friend of Doc, brings in Suzy, who has injured her hand breaking a window to steal some donuts. Doc, whose lack of a medical degree does not stop the denizens of Cannery Row from seeking him out for treatment, bandages her hand, as the irritated Millicent leaves. Suzy, new in town, is curious about Doc's work ("The Tide Pool") and tells about her journey from San Francisco ("Everybody's Got a Home but Me"). Fauna, who runs the nearby Bear Flag Café—an establishment open even at this hour—had heard that a new girl in town had injured herself, and has come to talk to Suzy. Fauna is initially reluctant to invite Suzy into the Bear Flag, but when Jim, the local plainclothes cop gives Suzy a hard time, Fauna takes Suzy in.
