40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity affects HDL metabolism was investigated using agents that selectively target CETP (<b>dalcetrapib,</b> torcetrapib, anacetrapib). In contrast with torcetrapib and anacetrapib, <b>dalcetrapib</b> requires cysteine 13 to decrease CETP activity, measured as transfer of cholesteryl ester (CE) from HDL to LDL, and does not affect transfer of CE from HDL 3 to HDL 2. Only <b>dalcetrapib</b> induced a conformational change in CETP, when added to human plasma in vitro, also observed in vivo and correlated with CETP activity. CETP-induced pre-β-HDL formation in vitro in human plasma was unchanged by <b>dalcetrapib</b> ≤ 3 µM and increased at 10 µM. A dose-dependent inhibition of pre-β-HDL formation by torcetrapib and anacetrapib (0. 1 to 10 µM) suggested that <b>dalcetrapib</b> modulates CETP activity. In hamsters injected with [3 H]cholesterol-labeled autologous macrophages, and given <b>dalcetrapib</b> (100 mg twice daily), torcetrapib [30 mg once daily (QD) ], or anacetrapib (30 mg QD), only <b>dalcetrapib</b> significantly increased fecal elimination of both [3 H]neutral sterols and [3 H]bile acids, whereas all compounds increased plasma HDL-[3 H]cholesterol. These data suggest that modulation of CETP activity by <b>dalcetrapib</b> does not inhibit CETP-induced pre-β-HDL formation, which {{may be required to}} increase reverse cholesterol transport...|$|E
40|$|Cholesteryl ester {{transfer}} protein (CETP) {{has been}} identified as a novel target for increasing HDL cholesterol levels. In this report, we describe the biochemical characterization of anacetrapib, a potent inhibitor of CETP. To better understand the mechanism by which anacetrapib inhibits CETP activity, its biochemical properties were compared with CETP inhibitors from distinct structural classes, including torcetrapib and <b>dalcetrapib.</b> Anacetrapib and torcetrapib inhibited CETP-mediated cholesteryl ester and triglyceride transfer with similar potencies, whereas <b>dalcetrapib</b> was a significantly less potent inhibitor. Inhibition of CETP by both anacetrapib and torcetrapib was not time dependent, whereas the potency of <b>dalcetrapib</b> significantly increased with extended preincubation. Anacetrapib, torcetrapib, and <b>dalcetrapib</b> compete with one another for binding CETP; however anacetrapib binds reversibly and <b>dalcetrapib</b> covalently to CETP. In addition, <b>dalcetrapib</b> was found to covalently label both human and mouse plasma proteins. Each CETP inhibitor induced tight binding of CETP to HDL, indicating that these inhibitors promote the formation of a complex between CETP and HDL, resulting in inhibition of CETP activity...|$|E
40|$|AIMS: Mixed dyslipidaemia, {{characterized}} by {{low levels of}} high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) {{and high levels of}} triglycerides, is common in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and/or metabolic syndrome. <b>Dalcetrapib</b> effectively increases HDL-C levels by modulating cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) activity. The aim of this analysis was to investigate the lipid modifying efficacy and safety of <b>dalcetrapib</b> in patients with T 2 DM and/or metabolic syndrome. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of <b>dalcetrapib</b> therapy in five placebo-controlled, Phase II trials (4 - 48 weeks of duration) involving T 2 DM and/or metabolic syndrome, in dyslipidaemic patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) or CHD risk equivalent. RESULTS: Both in patients with and without T 2 DM and/or metabolic syndrome, <b>dalcetrapib</b> decreased CETP activity by 26 - 58 % and increased HDL-C levels by 23 - 34 %, depending on dose and duration of treatment. <b>Dalcetrapib</b> did not significantly affect low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or apolipoprotein B levels. Treatment with <b>dalcetrapib</b> was generally well tolerated with a similar number of adverse events reported between patient groups and between those receiving <b>dalcetrapib</b> compared with placebo.

40|$|Purpose {{of review}} Cholesteryl ester {{transfer}} protein (CETP) -inhibiting drugs effectively raise HDL cholesterol. In 2007, the CETP inhibitor torcetrapib unexpectedly showed increased fatality and cardiovascular events, possibly related to increased {{blood pressure and}} aldosterone levels caused by torcetrapib. Since then, novel CETP inhibiting drugs have been investigated. This review will discuss {{the safety of the}} CETP-inhibiting drugs. Recent findings The novel CETP inhibitors <b>dalcetrapib,</b> evacetrapib and anacetrapib did not show harmful effects on blood pressure or aldosterone levels. Ultrasound brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilation, carotid MRI and F- 18 -fluordeoxyglucose PET imaging studies, showed that <b>dalcetrapib</b> therapy had neither harmful nor beneficial effects on endothelial function, atherosclerosis progression, or vessel wall inflammation.

40|$|Aims High-density {{lipoprotein}} cholesterol (HDL-C) is inversely {{associated with}} cardiovascular (CV) events and thus an attractive therapeutic target. However, {{in spite of}} marked elevations in HDL-C, the first cholesterol transport protein (CETP) inhibitor torcetrapib raised blood pressure (BP), impaired endothelial function, and increased CV mortality and morbidity. <b>Dalcetrapib</b> is a novel molecule acting on CETP with a different chemical structure to torcetrapib. As HDL stimulates nitric oxide (NO), suppresses inflammation, and exerts protective CV effects, we investigated the effects of <b>dalcetrapib</b> on endothelial function, blood pressure, inflammatory markers, and lipids in patients with, or at risk of, coronary heart disease (CHD) in a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial (clinicaltrials. gov number NCT 00655538). Methods and results Patients with target low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels received <b>dalcetrapib</b> 600 mg/day or placebo for 36 weeks on top of standard therapy (including statins). The primary outcome measures were the change from baseline of flow-mediated dilatation (%FMD) of the right brachial artery after 5 min of cuff occlusion at 12 weeks and the 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) at week 4. Secondary outcomes included change from baseline in FMD after 36 weeks and the change in ABPM at 12 and 36 weeks, changes in HDL-C, LDL-C, triglycerides, CETP activity, as well as standard safety parameters. Four hundred seventy-six patients were randomized. Baseline FMD was 4. 1 ± 2. 2 and 4. 0 ± 2. 4 % with placebo or <b>dalcetrapib,</b> respectively and did not change significantly from placebo after 12 and 36 weeks (P = 0. 1764 and 0. 9515, respectively). After 4, 24, and 36 weeks of treatment with <b>dalcetrapib,</b> CETP activity decreased by 51, 53, and 56 % (placebo corrected, all P < 0. 0001), while at weeks 4, 12, and 36 HDL-C increased by 25, 27, and 31 % (placebo corrected, all P < 0. 0001). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels did not change. At baseline, ABPM was 125 ± 12 / 74 ± 8 mmHg in the placebo and 128 ± 11 / 75 ± 7 mmHg in the <b>dalcetrapib</b> group (P = 0. 3372 and 0. 1248, respectively, placebo-corrected change from baseline) and did not change for up to 36 weeks. Biomarkers of inflammation, oxidative stress, and coagulation did not change during follow-up except for Lp-PLA 2 mass levels which increased by 17 % (placebo corrected). Overall 7 patients given <b>dalcetrapib</b> and 8 patients given placebo experienced at least one pre-specified adjudicated event (11 events with <b>dalcetrapib</b> and 12 events with placebo). Conclusion The dal-VESSEL trial has established the tolerability and safety of CETP-inhibition with <b>dalcetrapib</b> in patients with or at risk of CHD. <b>Dalcetrapib</b> reduced CETP activity and increased HDL-C levels without affecting NO-dependent endothelial function, blood pressure, or markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.

40|$|Abstract Background: As low HDL {{cholesterol}} levels are {{a risk factor}} for cardiovascular disease, raising HDL cholesterol substantially by inhibiting or modulating cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) may be useful in coronary artery disease. The first CETP inhibitor that went into clinical trial, torcetrapib, was shown to increase the levels of HDL cholesterol, but it also increased cardiovascular outcomes, probably due to an increase in blood pressure and aldosterone secretion, by an off-target mechanism/s. Objective/methods: <b>Dalcetrapib</b> is a new CETP modulator that increases the levels of HDL cholesterol, but does not increase blood pressure or aldosterone secretion. The objective was to evaluate a paper describing the effects of <b>dalcetrapib</b> on carotid and aortic wall thickness in subjects with, or at high risk, of coronary artery disease; the dal-PLAQUE study. Results: dal-PLAQUE showed that <b>dalcetrapib</b> reduced the progression of atherosclerosis and may also reduce the vascular inflammation associated with this, in subjects with, or with high risk of, coronary heart disease, who were already taking statins. Conclusions: These results suggest that modulating CETP with <b>dalcetrapib</b> may be a beneficial mechanism in cardiovascular disease. The results of the dal-HEART series, which includes dal-PLAQUE 1 and 2, and dal-OUTCOMES, when complete, will provide more definitive information about the benefit, or not, of <b>dalcetrapib</b> in coronary artery disease...|$|E

40|$|Background and purpose: The {{association}} between torcetrapib and its off-target effects on blood pressure suggested a possible class-specific effect. The effects of <b>dalcetrapib</b> (RO 4607381 /JTT- 705) and torcetrapib on haemodynamics and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) were therefore assessed in a rat model. Experimental approach: Arterial pressure (AP) {{and heart rate}} were measured by telemetry in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) receiving torcetrapib 10, 40 or 80 mg center dot kg- 1 center dot day- 1; <b>dalcetrapib</b> 100, 300 or 500 mg- 1 center dot kg center dot day- 1; or vehicle (placebo) for 5 days. Expression of RAAS genes in adrenal gland, kidney, aorta and lung from normotensive rats following 5 days' treatment with torcetrapib 40 mg center dot kg- 1 center dot day- 1, <b>dalcetrapib</b> 500 mg center dot kg- 1 center dot day- 1 or vehicle was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Key results: Torcetrapib transiently increased mean AP in normotensive rats (+ 3. 7 +/- 0. 1 mmHg), whereas treatment in SHR resulted in a dose-dependent and sustained increase [+ 6. 5 +/- 0. 6 mmHg with 40 mg center dot kg- 1 center dot day- 1 at day 1 (P < 0. 05 versus placebo) ], which lasted over the treatment period. No changes in AP or heart rate were observed with <b>dalcetrapib.</b> Torcetrapib, but not <b>dalcetrapib,</b> increased RAAS-related mRNAs in adrenal glands and aortas.

Inhibiting CETP significantly raises plasma concentrations of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, which has long been considered a marker of reduced CVD risk. However, the first CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, showed a surprising increase in CVD events, despite a dramatic increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. This paradox was explained by putative off-target effects not related to CETP inhibition that were specific to torcetrapib. Subsequently, three newer CETP inhibitors, namely <b>dalcetrapib,</b> anacetrapib, and evacetrapib, were at various phases of clinical development in 2012. Each of these had encouraging biochemical efficacy and safety profiles. <b>Dalcetrapib</b> even had human arterial imaging results that tended to look favorable. However, the <b>dalcetrapib</b> development program was recently terminated, presumably because interim analysis of a large CVD outcome trial indicated no benefit.

Men and women with CHD or CHD risk equivalent, with HDL-C levels < 50 mg/dL were recruited for a 36 -week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. After a pre-randomisation phase of up to 8 weeks, patients received <b>dalcetrapib</b> 600 mg/day or placebo {{in addition to their}} existing treatments. Brachial flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) measured by B-mode ultrasound represents endothelial function and is a validated marker for early atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease risk.

Methods and Results-Participants of the dal-OUTCOMES and dal-PLAQUE- 2 trials were randomly assigned to receive <b>dalcetrapib</b> or placebo in addition to standard care. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein was measured at baseline and at end of study in 5243 patients from dal-OUTCOMES also genotyped for the rs 1967309 polymorphism in adenylate cyclase 9. Cholesterol efflux capacity of high-density lipoproteins from J 774 macrophages after cAMP stimulation was determined at baseline and 12 months in 171 genotyped patients from dal-PLAQUE- 2. Treatment with <b>dalcetrapib</b> resulted in placebo-adjusted geometric mean percent increases in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein from baseline to end of trial of 18. 1 % (P= 0. 0009) and 18. 7 % (P= 0. 00001) in participants with the GG and AG genotypes, respectively, but the change was - 1. 0 % (P= 0. 89) in those with the protective AA genotype. There was an interaction between the treatment arm and the genotype groups (P= 0. 02). Although the mean change in cholesterol efflux was similar among study arms in patients with GG genotype (mean: 7. 8 % and 7. 4 %), increases were 22. 3 % and 3. 5 % with <b>dalcetrapib</b> and placebo for those with AA genotype (P= 0. 005).

40|$|BACKGROUND: In {{observational}} analyses, {{higher levels}} of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol {{have been associated with}} a lower risk of coronary heart disease events. However, whether raising HDL cholesterol levels therapeutically reduces cardiovascular risk remains uncertain. Inhibition of cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) raises HDL cholesterol levels and might therefore improve cardiovascular outcomes. METHODS: We randomly assigned 15, 871 patients who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome to receive the CETP inhibitor <b>dalcetrapib,</b> at a dose of 600 mg daily, or placebo, in addition to the best available evidence-based care. The primary efficacy end point was a composite of death from coronary heart disease, nonfatal myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, unstable angina, or cardiac arrest with resuscitation. RESULTS: At the time of randomization, the mean HDL cholesterol level was 42 mg per deciliter (1. 1 mmol per liter), and the mean low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol level was 76 mg per deciliter (2. 0 mmol per liter). Over the course of the trial, HDL cholesterol levels increased from baseline by 4 to 11 % in the placebo group and by 31 to 40 % in the <b>dalcetrapib</b> group. <b>Dalcetrapib</b> had a minimal effect on LDL cholesterol levels. Patients were followed for a median of 31 months. At a prespecified interim analysis that included 1135 primary end-point events (71 % of the projected total number), the independent data and safety monitoring board recommended termination of the trial for futility. As compared with placebo, <b>dalcetrapib</b> did not alter the risk of the primary end point (cumulative event rate, 8. 0 % and 8. 3 %, respectively; hazard ratio with <b>dalcetrapib,</b> 1. 04; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 93 to 1. 16; P= 0. 52) and did not {{have a significant effect on}} any component of the primary end point or total mortality. The median C-reactive protein level was 0. 2 mg per liter higher and the mean systolic blood pressure was 0. 6 mm Hg higher with <b>dalcetrapib</b> as compared with placebo (P< 0. 001 for both comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: In patients who had had a recent acute coronary syndrome, <b>dalcetrapib</b> increased HDL cholesterol levels but did not reduce the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events.

40|$|Hyperaldosteronism and {{hypertension}} were unexpected {{side effects}} observed in trials of torcetrapib, a cholesteryl ester-transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor that increases high-density lipoprotein. Given that CETP inhibitors are lipid soluble, accumulate in adipose tissue, and have binding sites for proteins involved in adipogenesis, and that adipocytes {{are a source}} of aldosterone, we questioned whether CETP inhibitors (torcetrapib, <b>dalcetrapib,</b> and anacetrapib) influence aldosterone production by adipocytes. Studies were performed using human adipocytes (SW 872), which express CETP, and mouse adipocytes (3 T 3 -L 1), which lack the CETP gene. Torcetrapib, <b>dalcetrapib,</b> and anacetrapib increased expression of CYP 11 B 2, CYP 11 B 1, and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein, enzymes involved in mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid generation. These effects were associated with increased reactive oxygen species formation. Torcetrapib, <b>dalcetrapib,</b> and anacetrapib upregulated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT 3) and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptor-γ, important in adipogenesis, but only torcetrapib stimulated production of chemerin, a proinflammatory adipokine. To determine mechanisms whereby CETP inhibitors mediate effects, cells were pretreated with inhibitors of Nox 1 /Nox 4 [GKT 137831; 2 -(2 -chlorophenyl) - 4 -[3 -(dimethylamino) phenyl]- 5 -methyl- 1 H-pyrazolo[4, 3 -c]pyridine- 3, 6 (2 H, 5 H) -dione], Nox 1 (ML 171 [2 -acetylphenothiazine]), mitochondria (rotenone), and STAT 3 (S 3 I- 201 [2 -hydroxy- 4 -(((4 -methylphenyl) sulfonyloxy) acetyl) amino) -benzoic acid]). In torcetrapib-stimulated cells, Nox inhibitors, rotenone, and S 3 I- 201 downregulated CYP 11 B 2 and steroidogenic acute regulatory protein and reduced aldosterone. <b>Dalcetrapib</b> and anacetrapib effects on aldosterone were variably blocked by GKT 137831, ML 171, rotenone, and S 3 I- 201. In adipocytes, torcetrapib, <b>dalcetrapib,</b> and anacetrapib inhibit enzymatic pathways responsible for aldosterone production through Nox 1 /Nox 4 - and mitochondrial-generated reactive oxygen species and STAT 3. CETP inhibitors also influence adipokine production. These processes may be CETP independent. Our findings identify novel adipocyte-related mechanisms whereby CETP inhibitors increase aldosterone production. Such phenomena may contribute to hyperaldosteronism observed in CETP inhibitor clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackgroundAtherosclerosis is an {{inflammatory}} condition with calcification apparent {{late in the}} disease process. The extent and progression of coronary calcification predict cardiovascular events. Relatively {{little is known about}} noncoronary vascular calcification. ObjectivesThis study investigated noncoronary vascular calcification and its influence on changes in vascular inflammation. MethodsA total of 130 participants in the dal-PLAQUE (Safety and efficacy of <b>dalcetrapib</b> on atherosclerotic disease using novel non-invasive multimodality imaging) study underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography at entry and at 6 months. Calcification of the ascending aorta, arch, carotid, and coronary arteries was quantified. Cardiovascular risk factors were related to arterial calcification. The influences of baseline calcification and drug therapy (<b>dalcetrapib</b> vs. placebo) on progression of calcification were determined. Finally, baseline calcification was related to changes in vascular inflammation. ResultsAge > 65 years old was consistently associated with higher baseline calcium scores. Arch calcification trended to progress more in those with calcification at baseline (p = 0. 055). There {{were no significant differences between}} progression of vascular calcification with <b>dalcetrapib</b> compared to that with placebo. Average carotid target-to-background ratio indexes declined over 6 months if carotid calcium was absent (single hottest slice [p = 0. 037], mean of maximum target-to-background ratio [p = 0. 010], and mean most diseased segment [p < 0. 001]), but did not significantly change if calcification was present at baseline. ConclusionsAcross multiple arterial regions, higher age is consistently associated with higher calcium scores. The presence of vascular calcification at baseline is associated with progressive calcification; in the carotid arteries, calcification appears to influence vascular inflammation. <b>Dalcetrapib</b> therapy did not affect vascular calcification...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Because {{high-density}} lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are {{inversely related to}} cardiovascular disease (CVD), raising HDL-C levels would seem intuitively valuable. However, the recent failure of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor torcetrapib to decrease CVD has raised doubts regarding HDL-C raising in general and CETP inhibition in particular for CVD prevention. We briefly discuss the complexity of HDL metabolism, caveats of CETP inhibition, possible mechanisms for torcetrapib 2 ̆ 7 s failure, and the potential utility of other CETP inhibitors. RECENT FINDINGS: Torcetrapib likely failed because of off-target effects, since other CETP inhibitors, such as <b>dalcetrapib</b> (JTT- 705 /R 1658) or anacetrapib (MK- 0859), do not increase blood pressure, a specific pressor effect of tocetrapib {{that appears to be}} CETP-independent. In small human trials of short duration, anacetrapib and <b>dalcetrapib</b> appear to improve the lipoprotein profile without obvious adverse effects, so far. SUMMARY: The relationship between HDL metabolism, pharmacologic CETP inhibition, and atherosclerosis requires further elucidation. There seems to be sufficient evidence that evaluation of CETP inhibitors such as <b>dalcetrapib</b> and anacetrapib should proceed, if cautiously, since it remains uncertain whether the increased CVD risk with torcetrapib was related to agent-specific off-target effects or more generally to CETP inhibition as a mechanism to raise HDL...|$|E

40|$|High-density {{lipoprotein}} (HDL) –based therapies {{have yielded}} disappointing results, 1 – 4 which {{have led to}} ques-tioning of the HDL hypothesis. Cholesteryl ester transfer pro-tein mediates the transfer of cholesteryl esters from HDL to apolipoprotein B-containing particles, such as low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). 5 Torcetrapib, the first cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor to be evaluated in a large clinical trial, caused excess morbidity and mortality despite increas-ing HDL-cholesterol levels by ≈ 70 % although elevations of aldosterone levels and blood pressure observed in some patients {{may have contributed to}} the negative findings. 3 <b>Dalcetrapib</b> is another cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitor that raises HDL-cholesterol levels by ≈ 30 %, without effects on circulat-ing neurohormones. 6 The dal-OUTCOMES trial was designed to test whether <b>dalcetrapib</b> could modify cardiovascular risk in patients with a recent acute coronary syndrome. ...|$|E

40|$|Background: Secondary {{prevention}} of coronary events {{in patients with}} known CHD and dyslipidemia has traditionally been focused on decreasing LDL-C {{through the use of}} statins. However, significant risk remains in individuals whose LDL-C has been optimized but HDL-C remains low. A new class of medications, cholesteryl ester transfer protein inhibitors, is effective at significantly increasing HDL-C and potentially reducing cardiovascular risk in such patients. There are currently three CETP inhibitors being developed, two of which have been studied for safety and efficacy in patients with CHD or risk equivalents: anacetrapib and <b>dalcetrapib.</b> Following the safety concerns of torcetrapib, both study medications have demonstrated {{that they do not have}} the same off-target effects as those seen in the ILLUMINATE trial. Methods: A systematic search of the literature was performed utilizing three databases: MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Evidence-Based Medicine Reviews Multifile. Four double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for review. Results: Anacetrapib demonstrated an impressive 138. 1 % greater increase in HDL-C, and 39. 8 % greater reduction in LDL-C as compared to placebo without any differences in tolerability or AEs. Although not a pre-determined end-point, there was a significant reduction in revascularization rates with anacetrapib as compared to placebo as well (8 vs 21). <b>Dalcetrapib</b> was also shown to be safe and effective, although its lipid-modifying effects were significantly less than those seen with anacetrapib. The dal-PLAQUE trial also suggested a potential benefit in reducing atherosclerotic lesions in the carotid arteries. Neither medication was shown to increase blood pressure or cardiovascular morbidity or mortality. Conclusion: Both anacetrapib and <b>dalcetrapib</b> have established themselves as safe and effective agents for increasing HDL-C, and to a lesser extent decreasing LDL-C. Although short-term data suggests a potential cardioprotective benefit with CETP inhibition, definitive conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Background : Despite {{contemporary}} therapies for {{acute coronary syndrome}} (ACS), {{morbidity and}} mortality remain high. Low levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are common among patients with ACS and may contribute to ongoing risk. Strategies that raise levels of HDL cholesterol, such as inhibition of cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), might reduce risk after ACS. Dal-OUTCOMES is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed {{to test the hypothesis}} that CETP inhibition with <b>dalcetrapib</b> reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with recent ACS. Design : The study will randomize approximately 15, 600 patients to receive daily doses of <b>dalcetrapib</b> 600 mg or matching placebo, beginning 4 to 12 weeks after an index ACS event. There are no prespecified boundaries for HDL cholesterol levels at entry. Other elements of care, including management of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, are to follow best evidence-based practice. The primary efficacy measure is time to first occurrence of coronary heart disease death, nonfatal acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina requiring hospital admission, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or atherothrombotic stroke. The trial will continue until 1, 600 primary end point events have occurred, all evaluable subjects have been followed for at least 2 years, and 80...|$|E
40|$|The plasma {{levels of}} {{high-density}} lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol are {{inversely related to}} cardiovascular risk. Traditional HDL-raising therapies, like fibrates, PPAR-γ agonists, and nicacin, among others, are associated with undesirable side effects, limited efficacy, or {{have not yet been}} shown to improve morbidity and mortality on top of statins in clinical outcome trials. A novel pharmacological target for raising circulating HDL-C levels is the cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP), an enzyme that facilitates the transport of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides between the lipoproteins. Four pharmacological small-molecule inhibitors of CETP, i. e. torcetrapib (Pfizer), <b>dalcetrapib</b> (JTT- 705; Roche), anacetrapib (Merck), and evacetrapib (Eli Lilly) have been developed. Notwithstanding a marked increase in HDL, torcetrapib was associated with an increase in all-cause mortality in the ILLUMINATE trial and raised safety concerns related to the off-target effects of CETP inhibition. Most recently, development of <b>dalcetrapib</b> was abruptly stopped {{due to a lack of}} clinically meaningful efficacy. Thus, it will be of utmost importance to demonstrate that the remaining CETP inhibitors in development not only increase HDL-C levels in plasma, but also improve HDL-function in patients with coronary disease or an acute coronary syndrome...|$|E
