By using a co-solvent, aggregation in solution {{can be prevented}} and doped films can be deposited.

40|$|A quantitative, {{contact-free}} {{method for}} extracting minority carrier diffusion length {{is used to}} measure the relatively small variations in diffusion length associated with dislocation bands in mismatched epitaxy in the p-type region of a two dimensional heterostructure of a triple junction (InGaP/GaAs/Ge) solar cell sample. These measurements are taken using the line scan mode of a Scanning Electron Microscope coupled with an optical microscope. This technique allowed the variations in diffusion length in the In 49 Ga 51 P sample to be measured to within 0. 1 microns. Also, the variations were not random but varied spatially with respect to the light and dark cathodoluminescence bands on the sample. However, there is an inverse relationship between the maximum luminescent intensity and the diffusion length. Since the radiative lifetime and non-radiative lifetime are on the same order of magnitude, a relationship between the maximum luminescent intensity and minority carrier diffusion length to the lifetimes were derived. With the radiative lifetime inversely dependent on the <b>free</b> <b>hole</b> concentration, a simulation was conducted to qualitatively reproduce the relationship between luminescent intensity and minority carrier diffusion length. The model simulated the non-radiative lifetime and <b>free</b> <b>hole</b> concentration decreasing across dislocation bands. This described the behavior of the non-radiative lifetime due to defect states associated with the dislocations. It also qualitatively illustrated the increase in radiative lifetime if the <b>free</b> <b>hole</b> concentration is reduced due to variations in Fermi level. Therefore, the simulation qualitatively described the spatial behavior of the diffusion length due to the presence of dislocations and reproduced the experimental anti-correlation between the diffusion length and maximum luminescent intensity.

40|$|Abstract. In general, Iodine doping {{concentration}} {{can affect}} the conductivity of the CNTs and explicitly the efficiency of organic solar cells. Iodine is a p-type dopant and when doped into MWCNTs it form an electron acceptor {{in the form of}} (I 3) - or (I 5) -. Therefore, electron transfer from Iodine to MWCNTs can generate <b>free</b> <b>hole</b> carriers. This <b>free</b> <b>hole</b> carriers is then collected by the electrodes. However, the generated free carriers depend on the concentration Iodine being used. It can be seen that as the concentration of Iodine increase from undope, 40 mg, 60 mg and 1 g, the I-MWCNTs are well dispersed in the polymer matrix. The results obtained reveal that the films are smooth as the concentration of Iodine increased. This shows that the agglomerations of the CNTs are less when there is more Iodine being doped with the CNTs. It can also be observed that as the Iodine concentration increased the film thickness decreased. In this work, the possibility to get efficiency with thickness of less than 60 nm is proved and the obtained efficiency with thickness about 51 nm at 1 g Iodine doping has been recorded with 8. 01 x 10 - 4 %...|$|E
