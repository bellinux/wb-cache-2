40|$|Under the {{direction}} of William Roberts.) Most practical combustion processes rely on turbulent diffusion flames due to their <b>higher</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates when compared to laminar diffusion flames. The <b>higher</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates occur because of the increased mixing that results from the flame’s interaction with the turbulent flow field. Unfortunately, the turbulent combustion process is very complex; therefore, simplified models have been constructed. Flamelet Theory is a method that characterizes turbulent diffusion flames {{as a collection of}} strained, laminar, one-dimensional flamelets. One caveat of this model is the flamelets are assumed to respond quasi-steadily to the applied flow field. The focus of my research has been to elucidate the influence of a time varying flow field on the combustion process. To test the response, the reaction zone of a propane-air counter-flow diffusion flame was subjected to time varying flow fields using speakers. The results of the experiments illustrate a reaction zone that responds quasi-steadily at forcing frequencies up to 50 Hz. Above this threshold, significant departures occur from steady flame behavior. At elevated frequencies, conditions were found where the reaction zone temperature was found to be i...|$|R

From this test condition, a homogeneous charge of fuel and intake air can be achieved. The test fuels were prepared by addition of 5 - 20 vol % diisobutylene into n-heptane and isooctane.

The gradual addition of diisobutylene into each primary reference fuel contributed to retarded <b>high</b> temperature <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> in these binary blends, increasing the in-cylinder temperature and decreasing formation of CO.

Constant velocity approach leads to reduced <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates at large sizes and constant residence time approach in unacceptable levels of pressure drop across the system. To achieve mild combustion at <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates at all scales, a modified approach with high recirculation is adopted in the present studies. Major geometrical dimensions are scaled as D similar to Q(1 / 3) with an air injection velocity of similar to 100 m/s (Delta p similar to 600 mm water gauge). Using CFD support, the position of air injection holes is selected to enhance the recirculation rates. The precise role of secondary air is to increase the recirculation rates and burn LIP the residual CO in the downstream. Measurements of temperature and oxidizer concentrations inside 3 kW, 150 kW burner and a jet flame are used to distinguish the combustion process in these burners.

For TiN, I observe selective oxidation of Ti atoms and formation of an ultrathin Ti oxide layer, while Ti vacancies are left behind at the metal/oxide interface. Within the formalism of ab initio thermodynamics I compute the segregation energies of vacancies and vacancy clusters at the metal/oxide interface, comparing {{the stability of the}} system obtained by FPMD simulations with ideally reconstructed models. Oxide nucleation on cobalt initially follows a metastable, kinetically driven path that results from the <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> during the dissociation of O 2. The early place-exchange of metal and oxygen atoms leads to the growth of an open, pseudo-amorphous oxide structure with evident Co 3 O 4 -like features. Instead, the oxidation of Cr(110) occurs along an energy path close to thermodynamic equilibrium and limited by Cr-ion diffusion already in the earliest oxidation stages. The initial formation of highly oxidized chromate-like structures seems to be precursory for the subsequent growth of Cr 2 O 3 thin films. The oxidation of CoCr alloys occurs via selective oxidation of chromium, which provide vacancies enabling the diffusion of oxygen atoms into inner atomic layers. This outward diffusion of chromium is strongly facilitated by the matrix of amorphous cobalt. In summary, I suggest that superficial oxidation may proceed along two distinct possible pathways: a thermodynamically stable path along the potential energy minimum surface and a metastable, kinetically driven path that results from the <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> during the dissociation of O 2...|$|R

In general, increasing the vortex length scale increases the surface growth rate, i. e. increases <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates, but for small length scales, i. e. when the ratio of vortex length scale to kernel diameter is small, high flame curvature induced during the interaction leads to flame weakening and slower growth rates.

The thermal balance equation was set up with known fire phenomena in a room. The hydrostatic model was applied to study the air intake rate through vertical openings. An equation relating <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate to room air temperature rise with empirical constants was then justified by reported experimental data on post-flashover room fire. The <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate was measured by the oxygen consumption method in that experiment. The predicted <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate from the empirical equation reported in the literature was observed to be proportional to the room air temperature rise as derived from hydrostatics. However, the proportionality constant is lower than the experimental value. A possible explanation is due to neglecting another fire phenomenon on air pumping action of the fire plume in a real room fire. Higher pressure differences across the door would give higher airflow rates across an opening. This would supply more air to give <b>higher</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate as observed in the experiment.

The flame behaviors are observed to depend strongly on {{the height of}} the flow tunnel. In particular, a non-monotonic trend of flame spread rate versus tunnel height is found, with the fastest flame occurring in the 3 cm high tunnel. The flame length and the total <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate from the flame also change with tunnel height, and a faster flame has a larger length and a <b>higher</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate. The computation analyses indicate that a confined space modifies the flow around the spreading flame. The confinement restricts the thermal expansion and accelerates the flow in the streamwise direction. Above the flame, the flow deflects back from the tunnel wall. This inward flow pushes the flame towards the fuel surface, and increases oxygen transport into the flame. Such a flow modification explains the variations of flame spread rate and flame length with tunnel height.

Flow and combustion characteristics of non-reacting and reacting swirl flowfields are characterized using a simulated Lean Direct Injection (LDI) method in a double concentric swirl burner. The LDI scheme had {{a large number of}} small size holes for fuel injection to provide rapid fuel mixing into the surrounding combustion air. The double concentric burner allowed examination of radial distribution of swirl in the burner (co- and counter-flow) under unconfined and confined conditions, both without and with combustion. The input thermal loading to the burner was held constant at 33 kW for all flames. Particle image velocimetry (PIV), optical emission spectroscopy (OES), infrared (IR) thermometry, gas analysis and computer compensated micro-thermocouple measurements, were used for diagnostics.

40|$|Three-dimensional direct {{numerical}} simulations {{with detailed}} chemistry {{were performed to}} investigate the effect of equivalence ratio on spatial variations of the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate and flame markers of hydrogen/carbon monoxide syngas expanding spherical premixed flames under turbulent conditions at elevated pressures. The flame structures and the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate were analysed and compared between fuel-lean, stoichiometric and fuel-rich centrally ignited spherical flames. The equivalence ratio changes the balance among thermo-diffusive effects, Darrieus-Landau instability and turbulence, leading to different flame dynamics and the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate distribution, despite exhibiting similar cellular and wrinkling flames. The Darrieus-Landau instability is relatively insensitive to the equivalence ratio while the thermo-diffusive process is strongly affected by the equivalence ratio. As the thermo-diffusive effect increases as the equivalence ratio decreases, the fuel-lean flame is more unstable than the fuel-rich flame with the stoichiometric flame in between, under the joint effects of the thermo-diffusive instability and the Darrieus-Landau instability. The local <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate and curvature display a positive correlation for the lean flame, no correlation for the stoichiometric flame, and negative correlation for the rich flame. Furthermore, for the fuel-lean flame, the low and <b>high</b> <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate values {{are found in the}} negative and positive curvature zones, respectively, while for the fuel-rich flame, the opposite trends are found. It is found that <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate markers based on species concentrations vary strongly with changing equivalence ratio. The results suggest that the HCO, HO 2 concentrations and product of OH and CH 2 O concentrations show good correlation with the local <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate for H 2 /CO premixed syngas-air stoichiometric flame under turbulent conditions at elevated pressures...|$|R
