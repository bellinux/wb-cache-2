50|$|This thin, {{delicate}} {{layer of}} organic material {{can be easily}} affected by humans. For instance, forest litter raking {{as a replacement for}} straw in husbandry is an old non-timber practice in forest management that has been widespread in Europe since the seventeenth century,. At its peak in 1853, an estimated 50 Kg dry litter per year was raked at the European level. This human disturbance, if not combined with other <b>degradation</b> <b>factors,</b> could promote podzolisation; if managed properly (for example, by burying litter removed after its use in animal husbandry), even the repeated removal of forest biomass may not have negative effects on pedogenesis.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} {{environmental}} <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> {{that need to}} be considered when assessing the print life of papers, including heat, humidity and airborne pollutants, in addition to light. Ignoring any of these or overestimating light alone is risky and has led to embarrassing over-predictions of print lifetime, such as that seen in the rapid degradation of some early ink jet prints due to atmospheric contaminants. However, no inkjet company (until recently) has made any claims about gas-fastness, only about light-fastness, even though many consumers display inkjet prints without the protection of glass (Wilhelm Imaging Research does its light-fastness tests under glass). Recently inkjet companies like Canon and Epson have been careful to point out that their criteria are on light-fastness and are very specific that they don't guarantee gas-fastness of their papers and inks.|$|E

40|$|To ensure data quality, the Earth-observing Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership {{satellite}} regularly performs on-orbit radiometric calibration of its 22 spectral bands. The primary radiance {{source for}} the calibration of the VIIRS reflective solar bands (RSBs) is a sunlit onboard solar diffuser (SD). During the calibration process, sunlight goes through a perforated plate (the SD screen) and then strikes the SD. The sunlight, scattered off the SD of near-Lambertian property, {{is used for the}} calibration. Consequently, the spectral radiance of the scattered sunlight is proportional to the product of the SD screen transmittance and the SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) value at the observation direction. The BRDF value is decomposed to the product of its initial value at launch and a numerical <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> that quantifies the decrease from the initial value. The <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> is determined by an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM). During the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> determination process, the SDSM receives the SD scattered sunlight and the sunlight that goes through another perforated plate at almost the same time. The ratio of the signal strengths from the two observations is used to determine the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor.</b> Consequently, the RSB radiometric calibration requires the accurate knowledge of the product of the SD screen transmittance and the initial BRDF value as sensed by the RSB and the SDSM detectors.

5000|$|The high {{toxicity}} of both forms of mercury (especially organic mercury) {{poses a threat}} to almost all organisms that comes in contact with it. This {{is one of the reasons}} that there is such high attention to mercury in the environment but even more so than its toxicity is both its persistence and atmospheric retention times. The ability of mercury to readily volatilize allows it to enter the atmosphere and travel far and wide. Unlike most other PBTs that have atmospheric half-lives between 30 min and 7 days mercury has an atmospheric residence time of at least 1 year. [...] This atmospheric retention time along with mercury’s resistance to <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> such as electromagnetic radiation and oxidation, which are two of the main factors leading to degradation of many PBTs in the atmosphere, allows mercury from any source to be transported extensively. This characteristic of mercury transportation globally along with its high toxicity is the reasoning behind its incorporation into the BNS list of PBTs.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a parallel-server system with K homogeneous servers where incoming tasks, arriving at rate λ, are dispatched by n dispatchers. Servers are FCFS queues and dispatchers implement a size-based policy {{such that the}} servers are equally loaded. We compare {{the performance of a}} system with n > 1 dispatchers and of a system with a single dispatcher. Every dispatcher handles a fraction 1 /n of the incoming traffic and balances the load to K/n servers. We show that the performance of a system with n dispatchers, K servers and arrival rate λ coincides with that of a system with one dispatcher, K/n servers and arrival rate λ/n. We define the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> as the ratio between the performance of a system with K servers and arrival rate λ and the performance of a system with K/n servers and arrival rate λ/n. We establish a partial monotonicity on n for the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> and, therefore, the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> is lower-bounded by one. We then investigate the upper-bound of the <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> for particular distributions. We consider two continuous service time distributions: uniform and Bounded Pareto that have increasing and decreasing failure rates, respectively; and a discrete distribution with two values, which is the distribution that maximizes the variance for a given mean.

40|$|The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suiteaboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (SNPP) {{satellite}} performs radiometric calibration of its reflective solar bands {{primarily through}} observing a sunlit onboard solar diffuser (SD). The SD bidirectional reflectance distribution function(BRDF) <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> {{is determined by}} an onboard SD stability monitor (SDSM), which observes the Sun through a pinhole screen and the sunlit SD. The transmittance of the SDSM pinhole screen over a range of solar angles was determined prelaunch and used initially to determine the BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor.</b> The degradation-factor-versus-time curves {{were found to have}} a number of very large unphysical undulations likely due to the inaccuracy in the prelaunch determined SDSM screen transmittance. To refine the SDSM screen transmittance, satellite yaw maneuvers were carried out. With the SDSM screen relative transmittance determined from the yaw maneuver data, the computed BRDFdegradation factor curves still have large unphysical ripples, indicating that the projected solar horizontal angular step size in the yaw maneuver data is too large to resolve the transmittance at a fine angular scale. We develop a methodology to use both the yaw maneuver and a small portion of regular on-orbit data to determine the SDSM screen relative transmittance at a fine angular scale. We determine that the error standard deviation of the calculated relative transmittance ranges from 0. 00030 (672 nm) to 0. 00092 (926 nm). With the newly determined SDSM screen relative transmittance, the computed BRDF <b>degradation</b> <b>factor</b> behaves much more smoothly over time...|$|R

It assesses the fracture mode of laminates with carbon fiber fabrics in (0, 90, 45) S ply orientation reinforced Polyphenylenesulphide (PPS) polymer matrix, tested for Interlaminar Shear Strength by the Short Beam method. Tests were conduced at different temperatures: (+ 20 ºC), (+ 0 ºC), and (- 55 ºC), under various moisture-absorbed contents, namely Dry, 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of the saturated condition. Fractographic analyses were made and reveal, by the analysis of the fracture surface, the dominant mode of failure in every temperature-moisture content pair.

40|$|The VoIP {{quality of}} service can be either {{estimated}} by analyzing the voice data flow characteristics, or by recording a transmitted voice probe over the whole VoIP transport chain and comparing it to the original. When the quality estimation by the voice data flow characteristics is deployed, the three most prominent <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> are observed – the packet loss, the packet delay and the delay variance (also called jitter). Depending on the estimation model, the values of these <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> are used to compute the resulting quality rating estimation. The end-to-end quality measurement provides more dependable results, however, it is also more technically and computationally demanding. We describe our experiences with both methods of quality evaluation and measurement. An experimental VPN for VoIP QoS measurements was created and a voice probe was sent through this network while end-to-end quality and <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> were observed. For end-to-end measurements we used our own developed equipment that allowed us to synchronize the original and recorded voice probe and obtain the timing characteristics.

30|$|Robustness {{against the}} <b>degradation</b> <b>factors</b> is {{essential}} for a reliable verification. A typical source of error in the iris recognition systems is lacking similarity between two iris patterns pertaining to the same individual.

The more the method is reliant on texture details, the more is the prone to failure verification. Generally, the existing methods dealing with NIR iris images tend to capture sharp variations of the texture and detailed information of the muscular structure like position and orientation of fibers. However, from blurred and unfocused iris images, no high frequency information can be obtained. Such dramatic performance degradation {{can be observed in}} the experiments conducted in [36].|$|E
