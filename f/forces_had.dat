Those men who successfully completed the parachute course were presented with their maroon beret and parachute wings.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Russian and Cossack <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> {{occupied}} {{the east of}} the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth as far as Lublin, with only Lwow (Lviv, Lemberg) remaining under Polish–Lithuanian control. In late October, Charles X Gustav headed northwards and left Wittenberg in Kraków with a mobile force of 3,000 Swedish and 2,000 Polish troops, and an additional number scattered in garrisons, to control {{the southern part of the}} Swedish-occupied commonwealth.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 9 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress, from due north to the northeast, toward the {{settlement}} of Prokhorovka. Hoth had formulated this move, and had discussed it with Manstein since early May, as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east, {{and he did not}} want his corps to be caught crossing the Psel River when they arrived. The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps joining in the attack toward Prokhorovka, but this could not be realised. The Soviet command, however, interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the German <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> faced driving toward Oboyan, and incorrectly believed the change indicated the German panzer <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> been severely weakened.|$|E
5|$|Secrecy for the {{operation}} was so tight that not all German ground and naval <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> been informed of {{the operation}} and some units suffered casualties from friendly fire.

5|$|The 13th Cavalry Brigade {{moved to}} cut the Nazareth to Tiberias road {{to the north of}} the town, before being ordered to return and occupy the town the next morning. By then the German and Ottoman <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> retired towards Tiberias from Nazareth which was {{occupied}} without opposition.|$|E
5|$|The Han Chinese also {{employed}} chemical warfare. In quelling {{a peasant}} revolt near Guiyang in 178 CE, the imperial Han <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> horse-drawn chariots carrying bellows {{that were used}} to pump powdered lime (calcium oxide) at the rebels, who were dispersed. In this same instance, they also lit incendiary rags tied to the tails of horses, so that the frightened horses would rush through the enemy lines and disrupt their formations.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim siege <b>forces</b> <b>had</b> been {{weakened}} by the withdrawal of 9,000 men to repel the Byzantine relief force.
