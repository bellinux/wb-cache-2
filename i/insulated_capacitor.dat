2500|$|Winterberg has {{published}} numerous {{articles in the}} area of inertial confinement fusion. In particular Winterberg is known for the idea of impact fusion and the concept of the magnetically insulated diode for the generation of multi-megampere megavolt ion beams for the purpose of heating plasmas to thermonuclear fusion temperatures. He conceived of a nuclear fusion propulsion reactor for space travel, which is called the Winterberg / Daedalus Class Magnetic Compression Reaction Chamber, which was later developed at the University of Alabama at Huntsville's Propulsion Research Center. [...] Most recently he has designed a giant spacecraft, propelled with deuterium micro-detonations ignited by a GeV proton beam, drawn from the space craft acting as an electrically charged up and magnetically <b>insulated</b> <b>capacitor</b> Winterberg also developed ideas for mining increasingly rare industrially crucial elements on planetary bodies such as the moon using fusion detonation devices. He became involved with the idea of using beam weapons in outer space in the late 1970s while working at the Desert Research Institute.|$|E
40|$|Where charged {{electrode}} surfaces meet fluids {{that contain}} mobile ions, so-called electric double layers (EDLs) form to screen the electric surface charge by a diffuse cloud of counterionic {{charge in the}} fluid phase. This double layer has been studied {{for over a century}} and is of paramount importance to many processes in physical chemistry and soft matter physics, as well as in electric double layer capacitors (EDLCs) used for energy storage. With the ongoing development of nanomaterials, electrodes can nowadays be built from porous carbon with internal surface areas up to 2000 m 2 /g, leading to very high capacitances. However, in EDLCs made from this material, the size of hydrated ions is on the same length scale as their confining geometry. This poses a substantial theoretical challenge, since EDL models must address both the electrostatics and the packing of the ions. To address this challenge, model calculations of different levels of sophistication are presented throughout this thesis. These calculations give access to the capacitance, the relation between the electrostatic potential and the charge on the electrodes’ surface. Particularly, we focus on the interplay between the capacitance and the temperature the electrolyte solution. First, we show that the electrostatic potential at fixed electrode charge rises with electrolyte temperature. This thermal voltage rise is predicted by calculations and observed in experiments, both {{in the case of an}} aqueous and an organic solvent. This finding opens the door to thermal energy harvesting with EDLCs. To this end, we propose to convert thermal into electric energy via a charging-heating-discharging-cooling cycle of an EDLC in alternating contact with heat reservoirs at either high or low temperature. The essence of this cycle is the surplus of energy harvested during discharging at high temperature (and associated high potentials) compared to the energy invested during charging at lower temperature (hence lower potentials). As another possible application of the thermal voltage rise, we show that harvesting “blue” energy from the spontaneous mixing process of fresh and salt water can be boosted by varying the water temperature during a capacitive mixing cycle. We show that the energy output of blue engines can be increased by a factor of order two if warm fresh water is mixed with cold seawater. Note that we do not advocate to consume fossil fuels to generate warm water, but rather to use (industrial) waste heat, which is abundantly available. While electrolyte temperature affects EDLC capacitance, the reverse is also true. As a second example of the interplay between temperature and EDLC capacitance, we consider how the charging of an EDLC affects the electrolyte temperature. For a thermally <b>insulated</b> <b>capacitor</b> that is charged quasi-statically, thermodynamics demands via the second law (dS = 0) that the ionic configuration entropy decrease upon EDL formation is counterbalanced by an electrolyte entropy increase: the EDLC heats up. Upon quasi-static adiabatic discharging, the opposite happens: the electrolyte cools while the EDL breaks down. We discuss various earlier models, and propose a new thermodynamic identity that fixes some of their shortcomings...|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{radiation}} hazard for manned missions to Mars and beyond, a high specific impulse-high thrust system is needed, {{with a nuclear}} bomb propulsion system the preferred candidate. The propulsion with small fission bombs is excluded because the critical mass requirement leads to extravagant small fission burn up rates. This leaves open the propulsion with non-fission ignited thermonuclear micro-explosions, with a compact fusion micro-explosion igniter (driver), and no large radiator. It should {{not depend on the}} rare He 3 isotope, and only require a small amount of tritium. This excludes lasers for ignition. With multi-mega-amperegigavolt proton beams and a small amount of tritium, cylindrical deuterium targets can be ignited. The proton beams are generated by discharging the entire spacecraft as a magnetically <b>insulated</b> gigavolt <b>capacitor.</b> To avoid a large radiator, needed to remove the heat from the absorption of the fast neutrons in the spacecraft, the micro-explosion is surrounded by a thick layer of liquid hydrogen, stopping the neutrons and heating the hydrogen to a temperature of ~ 10 5 K, which as a fully ionized plasma can be repelled from the spacecraft by a magnetic mirror. 1...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{interesting}} areas of supercritical fluids applications is the processing of novel materials. These new materials are designed to meet specific requirements and to make possible new applications in Pharmaceuticals design, heterogeneous catalysis, micro- and nano-particles with unique structures, special <b>insulating</b> materials, super <b>capacitors</b> and other special technical materials. Two distinct possibilities to apply supercritical fluids in processing of materials: synthesis of materials in supercritical fluid environment and/or further processing of already obtained materials with the help of supercritical fluids. By adjusting synthesis parameters the properties of supercritical fluids can be significantly altered which further results in the materials with different structures. Unique materials can be also obtained by conducting synthesis in quite specific environments like reversed micelles. This paper is mainly devoted to processing of previously synthesized materials which are further processed using supercritical fluids. Several new methods have been developed to produce micro- and nano-particles with the use of supercritical fluids. The following methods: rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) supercritical anti-solvent (SAS), materials synthesis under supercritical conditions and encapsulation and coating using supercritical fluids were recently developed...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{many of the}} {{communication}} systems are operated in several different bandwidths. Till now, the common solution to get a multi bandwidth transmitter/receiver is to insert several fixed microwave devices with different bandwidth to the required standard. This increases the size and power consumption of trans/receiver. One solution is to develop electronically tunable microwave devices. By replacing several fixed microwave devices with a single electronically tunable device, the size and power consumptions of the transmitter/receiver can be significantly reduced. The tunable devices are usually implemented by high permittivity tunable materials that exhibit a change of dielectric constant {{with respect to a}} DC electric field. In this work, two different types of tunable materials: ferroelectric Barium Strontium Titanate (BST) Oxide and pyrochloe Bismuth Zinc Niobate Oxide (BZN) thin films are investigated. A simple and cost effective chemical solution deposition (CSD) method has been used to prepare the thin films. In addition, two different types of microwave devices (coplanar waveguide and metal <b>insulated</b> metal <b>capacitors)</b> were fabricated to measure the microwave dielectric properties of BST and BZN thin films. The maximum errors in the measured dielectric constants are 24 % due to the calibration errors. To improve the dielectric properties of BST thin films, acceptor ions such as lithium (Li) and cobalt (Co) were doped into BST thin films. According to the measured results, the Li doped BST thin film exhibits an increase of dielectric constant and a decrease of dielectric loss, which makes it highly attractive for implementing microwave device. In contrast, the BZN thin films exhibit little dielectric tunability (3. 0 %) even when a large DC electric field (500 kV/cm) is applied. These results demonstrate that ferroelectric BST thin films are still the only practical materials for implementing tunable microwave devices due to its high tunability.

Using deuterium as the rocket fuel of choice, abundantly available on the comets of the Oort cloud, rockets driven by deuterium fusion, can there be refueled. To obtain a high thrust with a high specific impulse, favors the propulsion by deuterium micro-bombs, and it is shown that the ignition of deuterium micro-bombs is possible by intense GeV proton beams, generated in space by using the entire spacecraft as a magnetically <b>insulated</b> billion volt <b>capacitor.</b> The cost to develop this kind of propulsion system in space would be very high, {{but it can also be}} developed on earth by a magnetically insulated Super Marx Generator.
