He argued that conservatism must be a philosophy concerned with social change, and must be defensible using public reason. To that end, he defined conservatism as the <b>knowledge</b> <b>principle</b> plus the change principle. The <b>knowledge</b> <b>principle,</b> influenced by scepticism, states that:“because society and its mediating institutions are highly complex and dynamic with natures that are constantly evolving as they are co-constituted with the individuals who are their members, both data and theories about society are highly uncertain”.|$|E

A version of adjectival conservatism derived from epistemological scepticism, consisting of a <b>knowledge</b> <b>principle</b> and a change principle, is presented.

40|$|There {{are various}} reasons for favouring ψ-epistemic interpretations of quantum {{mechanics}} over ψ-ontic interpretations. One such reason is the correlation between quantum mechanics and Liouville dynamics. Another reason is {{the success of a}} specific epistemic model (Spekkens, 2007), in reproducing a wide range of quantum phenomena. The potential criticism, that Spekkens ’ restricted <b>knowledge</b> <b>principle</b> is counter-intuitive, is rejected using ‘everyday life ’ examples. It is argued that the dimensionality of spin favours Spekkens ’ model over ψ-ontic models. van Enk’s ex-tension of Spekkens ’ model (2007) can even reproduce Bell Inequality violations, but requires negative probabilities to do so. An epistemic account of negative probabil-ities is the missing element for deciding the battle between ψ-epistemic and ψ-ontic interpretations in favour of the former. ...|$|E

(2) A plausible extension of that principle, called the Breadth Hypothesis: there are two additional abilities necessary for intelligent behavior in unexpected situations: falling back on increasingly general knowledge, and analogizing to specific but far-flung knowledge. (3) AI as Empirical Inquiry: we must test our ideas experimentally, on large problems. Each of these three hypotheses proposes a particular threshold to cross, which leads to a qualitative change in emergent intelligence. Together, they determine a direction for future AI research. 1.

Unfortunately, today, the largest majority of documents on the web are available in forms that do not carry additional semantics.

40|$|In {{this article}} {{the nation is}} {{shown to be a}} {{historical}} subject. As such, it is constructed and constantly reconstructed by discursive practices of power and knowledge. The author argues that the symbiotic interlinkage between nationalism and the organising <b>knowledge</b> <b>principle</b> of historicity, {{is an example of a}} power practice in the modern state. Throughout the article, it is shown that this practice is produced by interaction between the institutionally represented, sovereign or objective state and intellectual knowledge and its institutionalisation within the state as an academy, which acquires sovereignty in the production of objective truth. This peculiar discursive representation of making what really is personal interactions and struggles into official institutions has managed to produce the subject of the historical nation. The empirical case of Sweden is briefly discussed. During the age of great power, an exclusivist discourse of noble genealogical distinction of the 'Goths' was established. In modem Sweden, this genealogical myth is transformed to a popular national myth of exclusivity, a myth with great power potentials in the 'national projects' of modem politics...|$|E
40|$|This Article {{argues that}} {{copyright}} jurisprudence has {{lost sight of}} the <b>knowledge</b> <b>principle</b> {{at the heart of the}} Constitutional justification for copyright. The Framers envisioned the objective of copyright as promoting the advancement of knowledge for a democratic society by increasing access to published works. Under what is best termed the “knowledge principle,” access to existing knowledge is a necessary condition for the creation of new knowledge. Copyright jurisprudence has largely protected the interests of producers – from early booksellers to modern Hollywood film companies – failing to notice the central role of access to works as a necessary pre-condition to the creation of new works. The realities of the digital era further hinder the functioning of this mechanism. Ownership of copies of texts has morphed into a limited right of possession of digital files. Public libraries can no longer fulfill their mission of maximizing the circulation of materials in order to spread available knowledge among citizens. This Article proposes an alternative model to the conventional copyright theories, focusing on the critical role that access to knowledge resources plays in the dynamic processes at work in the production of knowledge and the creation of new works. This Article proposes a non-waivable “fair access” right exercisable by public libraries in order to realign copyright with its Constitutional justification, and more importantly to support the knowledge creation process for the future of our democratic society...|$|E

Debriefing after simulation is an area where the underlying structure of problems can consciously be explored. When central principles of problems are identified, they can then be used in situations that differ from the simulation experience. Third year undergraduate nursing students participated in a pilot study conducted to test a debriefing intervention where the intervention group (n= 7) participated in a simulation, followed by a debriefing based on transfer of <b>knowledge</b> <b>principles.</b> The control group (n= 5) participated in a simulation of the same scenario, followed by a standard debriefing.

30|$|Generally, the <b>knowledge,</b> <b>principles,</b> {{and skills}} of {{language}} testing {{are known as}} LAL (Davies, 2008; Fulcher, 2012; Malone, 2008). Assessment literacy largely {{has been defined as}} “teachers’ understanding of assessment processes as well as their capacities to design assessment tasks, develop adequate criteria for making valid judgments on the quality of students’ performances, and understand and act upon the information that is collected through assessment” (Hay & Penney, 2013, pp. 69 – 70).

Hence, LAL incorporates <b>knowledge</b> of language, <b>principles,</b> and skills of language testing (Davies, 2008; Fulcher, 2012; Inbar-Lourie, 2013 b). For this article, LAL is defined as the familiarity of language teachers with the basic ideas of testing, the ability to apply those ideas in classroom instruction, and the capacity to perform language assessment-related tasks (Inbar-Lourie, 2008; Melone, 2013; Taylor, 2009).|$|R
