60|$|Tito was one {{of those}} who {{remained}} behind. He had a native repugnance to sights of death and pain, and five days ago whenever he had thought of this execution as a possibility he had hoped that it would not take place, and that the utmost sentence would be exile: his own safety demanded no more. But now he felt that it would be a welcome guarantee of his security when he had learned that Bernardo del Nero's head was off the shoulders. The new knowledge and new attitude towards him disclosed by Romola on the day of his return, had given him a new dread of the power she possessed to make his position insecure. If any act of hers only succeeded in making him an object of suspicion and odium, he foresaw not only frustration, but frustration under unpleasant circumstances. Her belief in Baldassarre had clearly determined her wavering feelings against <b>further</b> <b>submission,</b> and if her godfather lived she would win him to share her belief without much trouble. Romola seemed more than ever an unmanageable fact in his destiny. But if Bernardo del Nero were dead, the difficulties that would beset her in placing herself in opposition to her husband would probably be insurmountable to her shrinking pride. Therefore Tito had felt easier when he knew that the Eight had gone to the Bargello to order the instant erection of the scaffold. Four other men--his intimates and confederates--were to die, besides Bernardo del Nero. But a man's own safety is a god that sometimes makes very grim demands. Tito felt them to be grim: even in the pursuit of what was agreeable, this paradoxical life forced upon him the desire for what was disagreeable. But he had had other experience of this sort, and as he heard through the open doorway the shuffle of many feet and the clanking of metal on the stairs, he was able to answer the questions of the young French envoy without showing signs of any other feeling than that of sad resignation to State necessities.|$|E

The analysis is based on a corpus of referee reports written for an international academic journal in the field of comparative labour law and industrial relations, and provides an overview of some of the rhetorical devices employed by the practitioners in a specific discourse community as they attempt to construct reviews that are reader-friendly and audience-sensitive, while making critical judgements that can result in the inclusion or exclusion of authors submitting manuscripts for publication. The discourse practices deployed by anonymous referees reveal a tension between the need to enforce certain discourse community norms, and to justify their appraisal to the interlocutor (whose identity has been concealed), constructing an argument that is both informative and persuasive. Rather than displaying a clear positive-negative polarity, the reviews may be placed on a cline between the two extremes, with a significant number of referees also providing tutorial advice as to the requirements to be met before <b>further</b> <b>submission.</b> The acquisition of generic competence on the part of authors submitting manuscripts therefore emerges as a key objective for the peer reviewer, highlighting the collaborative nature of academic writing, albeit behind a veil of anonymity...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the best legal arragements {{to ensure a}} balance between the need to protect some Commonwealth information and the need to maintain an open and accountable government through providing appropriate access to information. The ALRC has identified and considered 507 secrecy provisions scattered across 175 pieces of legislation, including 358 distinct secrecy offences carrying a wide variety of criminal penalties. This discussion paper indicates the inquiry’s current thinking in the form of specific reform proposals. In trying to move towards a more open and ‘pro-disclosure culture’, the ALRC proposes a substantial decrease in the use of criminal sanctions – limiting prosecutions to those unauthorised disclosures in which it is alleged that harm has been caused, or was likely to be caused, to a compelling public interest. In most cases, however, the ALRC proposes that concerns about the protection of Commonwealth information should be addressed through better education and training, improved information handling practices, and public service disciplinary procedures. The proposals contained in DP  74 do not represent the final recommendations of the Inquiry. The ALRC is seeking <b>further</b> <b>submissions</b> and is undertaking a further round of national consultations on the proposals in DP  74.
