5|$|In {{the history}} of art, the {{original}} Greek authorities are Duris of Samos, Xenocrates of Sicyon, and Antigonus of Carystus. The anecdotic element has been ascribed to Duris (XXXIV:61); the notices of the successive developments {{of art and the}} list of workers in bronze and painters to Xenocrates; and a large amount of miscellaneous information to Antigonus. Both Xenocrates and Antigonus are named in connection with Parrhasius (XXXV:68), while Antigonus is named in the indexes of XXXIII–XXXIV as a writer on the art of <b>embossing</b> metal, or working it in ornamental relief or intaglio.|$|E
5|$|The {{children}} were {{taught how to}} read by a system devised by the school's founder, Valentin Haüy. Not blind himself, Haüy was a philanthropist who {{devoted his life to}} helping the blind. He designed and manufactured a small library of books for the children using a technique of <b>embossing</b> heavy paper with the raised imprints of Latin letters. Readers would trace their fingers over the text, comprehending slowly but in a traditional fashion which Haüy could appreciate.|$|E
5|$|Hu {{lived in}} Nanjing during the {{transition}} from the Ming dynasty to the Qing dynasty. A Ming loyalist, he was offered a position at the rump court of the Hongguang Emperor, but declined the post, and never held anything more than minor political office. He did, however, design the Hongguang Emperor's personal seal, and his loyalty to the dynasty was such that he largely retired from society after the emperor's capture and death in 1645. He owned and operated an academic publishing house called the Ten Bamboo Studio, in which he practised various multi-colour printing and <b>embossing</b> techniques, and he employed several members of his family in this enterprise. Hu's work at the Ten Bamboo Studio pioneered new techniques in colour printmaking, leading to delicate gradations of colour which were not previously achievable in this art form.|$|E

40|$|Capacitive micromachined {{ultrasonic}} transducers (CMUTs) {{have emerged}} as a competitive alternative to piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, especially in medical ultrasound imaging and therapeutic ultrasound applications, which require high output pressure. However, as compared with piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers, the output pressure capability of CMUTs remains to be improved. In this paper, a novel structure is proposed by forming an <b>embossed</b> vibrating membrane on a CMUT cell operating in the collapse mode to increase the maximum output pressure. By using a beam model in undamped conditions and finite-element analysis simulations, the proposed <b>embossed</b> structure showed improvement on the maximum output pressure of the CMUT cell when the <b>embossed</b> pattern {{was placed on the}} estimated location of the peak deflection. As compared with a uniform membrane CMUT cell worked in the collapse mode, the proposed CMUT cell can yield the maximum output pressure by 51. 1 % and 88. 1 % enhancement with a single <b>embossed</b> pattern made of Si 3 N 4 and nickel, respectively. The maximum output pressures were improved by 34. 9 % (a single Si 3 N 4 <b>embossed</b> pattern) and 46. 7 % (a single nickel <b>embossed</b> pattern) with the uniform membrane when the center frequencies of both original and <b>embossed</b> CMUT designs were similar.

25|$|Although the {{invention}} of the printing press led to a reduced interest in hand made cards and items, by the eighteenth century, people were regaining interest in detailed handwork. Parchment cards became larger in size and crafters began adding wavy borders and perforations.

30|$|From the {{numerical}} analysis, when the <b>embossed</b> part was cooled, it shrank {{from the edge}} toward the thermal center of the <b>embossed</b> part but the sidewall of a mold cavity contacting the post prevented its shrinkage. This caused thermal stress and stress concentration in the post. As {{the distance between the}} posts and thermal center increased, thermal stresses also increased since they were proportional to the amount of shrinkage of the <b>embossed</b> part.|$|R
