50|$|Common {{types of}} leaks {{for many people}} include leaks in vehicle tires, causing air to leak out {{resulting}} in flat tires, and leaks in containers, spilling the contents. Leaks can occur or develop in {{many different kinds of}} household, building, vehicle, marine, aircraft, or industrial fluid systems, whether the fluid is a gas or liquid. Leaks in vehicle hydraulic systems such as brake or power steering lines could cause outleakage of brake or power steering fluid resulting in failure of the brakes, power steering, or other hydraulic system.

40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} viscous fingers {{created by}} injection of low vis-cosity fluid into {{the network of}} capillaries initially filled with a more viscous <b>fluid</b> (<b>motor</b> oil). Due to the anisotropy {{of the system and}} its geometry, such a setup promotes the formation of long-and-thin fin-gers which then grow and compete for the available flow, interacting through the pressure field. The interaction between the fingers is ana-lyzed using the branched growth formalism of Halsey and Leibig (Phys. Rev. A 46, 7723, 1992) using a number of simple, analytically tractable models. It is shown that as soon as the fingers are allowed to capture the flow from one another, the fixed point appears in the phase space, corresponding to the asymptotic state in which the growth of one of the fingers in hindered by the other. The properties of phase space flows in such systems are shown to be remarkably insensitive to the details of the dynamics. ...|$|E
