In the 1970s, the World Hockey Association sought to challenge for the Cup. By this time, all Cup Trustees were longtime NHL loyalists, and {{under the direction of}} NHL President Clarence Campbell the WHA's challenge for the Cup was blocked. <b>However,</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> the aforementioned legal obligation, the NHL (considering not only the WHA's presence but also the rising caliber of European ice hockey leagues) quietly discontinued calling its champions the world champions.|$|E
25|$|<b>However,</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> {{the grant}} of {{original}} jurisdiction, the Court has, through the years, assigned to lower courts {{such as the}} Court of Appeals the power to hear petitions for certiorari, prohibition, mandamus, quo warranto and habeas corpus. As a result, the Court has considerable discretion to refuse to hear these petitions filed directly before {{it on the ground}} that such should have been filed instead with the Court of Appeals or the appropriate lower court. Nonetheless, cases that have attracted wide public interest or for which a speedy resolution is of the essence have been accepted for decision by the Supreme Court without hesitation.|$|E
25|$|In practice, {{the theory}} of the actual Fowler-Nordheim {{tunneling}} process is much the same for all materials (though details of barrier shape may vary, and modified theory has to be developed for initial states that are localized rather than are travelling-wave-like). <b>However,</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> such differences, one expects (for thermodynamic equilibrium situations) that all CFE equations will have exponents that behave in a generally similar manner. This is why applying Fowler-Nordheim-type equations to materials outside the scope of the derivations given here often works. If interest is only in parameters (such as field enhancement factor) that relate to the slope of Fowler-Nordheim or Millikan-Lauritsen plots and to the exponent of the CFE equation, then Fowler-Nordheim-type theory will often give sensible estimates. However, attempts to derive meaningful current density values will usually or always fail.|$|E

60|$|Here, {{it must be}} {{sincerely}} confessed, <b>however,</b> that <b>notwithstanding</b> his {{numerous other}} merits, my favorite author betrays a want of the uttermost antiquarian and penetrating spirit, which would have scorned to stop in its researches at {{the reign of the}} Norman monarch, but would have pushed on resolutely through the dark ages, up to Moses, the man of Uz, and Adam; and finally established the fact beyond a doubt, that the soil of Liverpool was created with the creation.|$|R
2500|$|While the Nuremberg Tribunals {{failed to}} charge Nazi war criminals with rape, {{witnesses}} testified about it occurring. Previous war crimes trials had prosecuted for sex crimes, hence war rape {{could have been}} prosecuted under customary law and/or under the IMT (International Military Tribunals) Charter's Article 6(b): [...] "abduction of the civilian population....into slavery and for other purposes" [...] and [...] "abduction unjustified by military necessity." [...] Similarly, {{it would have been}} possible to prosecute war rape as crime against humanity under Article 6(c) of the Nuremberg Charter: [...] "other inhumane acts" [...] and [...] "enslavement". <b>However,</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> evidence of sexual violence in Europe during World War II, a lack of will led to rape and sexual violence not being prosecuted at the Nuremberg Tribunals.|$|E

She knew that there must be many who had remained friends to her cause. She thought that if she could once make her escape from her prison, these friends would rally around her, and that she could thus, perhaps, regain her throne again. But strictly watched as she was, and in a prison which was surrounded by the waters of a lake, all hope of escape seemed to be taken away.|$|E

The Nez Perces, <b>however,</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> their recent loss, were still {{careless}} of their horses; merely driving them to some secluded spot, and leaving them there for the night, without setting any guard upon them. The consequence was a second swoop, in which forty-one were carried off. This was borne with equal philosophy with the first, and no effort was made either to recover the horses, or to take vengeance on the thieves.|$|E

He has warned Archbishop Gabriel that his actions may lead to 'pernicious consequences' and that, through these actions, Gabriel is 'taking upon himself full responsibility for further deterioration in the relations between the Russian Orthodox Church and the Archdiocese which leads'.|$|R

In addition to the transit system failing to cater to the needs of some segments of the population, low-income workers and the non-registered unemployed remain excluded from the subsidized pricing schemes...|$|R
60|$|The {{poor girl}} bore all patiently, and dared {{not tell her}} father, who would have rattled her off; for his wife governed him entirely. When she had done her work, she used {{to go into the}} chimney-corner, and sit down among cinders and ashes, which made her {{commonly}} be called Cinderwench; but the youngest, who was not so rude and uncivil as the eldest, called her Cinderella. <b>However,</b> Cinderella, <b>notwithstanding</b> her mean apparel, was a hundred times handsomer than her sisters, though they were always dressed very richly.|$|R

So, in a word, I committed the finishing it all to my faithful friend the Quaker, to whom I communicated as much of the whole story as was needful to empower her to perform what Amy had promised, and to make her talk so much to the purpose, as one employed more remotely than Amy had been, needed to be.|$|E

Retired Victorian Supreme Court Justice Alec Southwell, appointed Commissioner by the church to investigate the matter, found that the complainant {{gave the impression of}} [...] "speaking honestly from actual recollection".

England's necessity was their opportunity, and one of which they certainly meant to avail themselves. Accordingly, notices were sent out summoning the burghers of the Transvaal to attend a mass meeting on the 18th March, at a place about thirty miles from Pretoria. Emissaries were also sent to native chiefs, to excite them to follow Cetywayo's example, and massacre all the English within reach, of whom a man called Solomon Prinsloo {{was one of the}} most active. The natives, <b>however,</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> the threats used towards them, one and all declined the invitation.|$|E

60|$|My old fastidiousness came in; to {{my taste}} {{there was always}} {{something}} wrong about them. While they attracted one part of my nature they revolted another part, and on the whole I preferred to do without their intimate society, rather than work violence to this second and higher part of me. Moreover, quite at the beginning of my career I had concluded from observation that a man gets on better in life alone, rather than with another to drag at his side, or by whom perhaps he must be dragged. Still true marriage, such as most men and some women have dreamed of in their youth, had always been one of my ideals; indeed it was on and around this vision that I wrote that first book of mine which was so successful.

From these rovers, <b>however,</b> <b>notwithstanding</b> the lateness of the hour Cedric and Athelstane accounted themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides Wamba and Gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester and the other a captive. It may be added, that in travelling thus late through the forest, Cedric and Athelstane relied on their descent and character, as well as their courage. The outlaws, whom the severity of the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life, were chiefly peasants and yeomen of Saxon descent, and were generally supposed to respect the persons and property of their countrymen.|$|E
