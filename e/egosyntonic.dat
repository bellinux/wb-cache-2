50|$|<b>Egosyntonic</b> and egodystonic are terms used in psychoanalysis. <b>Egosyntonic</b> {{is a term}} {{referring}} to behaviors, values, and feelings that are in harmony with or acceptable {{to the needs and}} goals of the ego, or consistent with one's ideal self-image. Egodystonic (or ego alien) is the opposite of <b>egosyntonic</b> and refers to thoughts and behaviors (e.g., dreams, impulses, compulsions, desires, etc.) that are in conflict, or dissonant, with the needs and goals of the ego, or, further, in conflict with a person's ideal self-image.|$|E
5000|$|The terms egodystonic and <b>egosyntonic</b> {{are used}} within the Roman Catholic Church in that, {{according}} to gay-rights advocate Bernard Lynch, priests who are gay but egodystonic, that is [...] "hate their homosexuality", are acceptable, whereas <b>egosyntonic</b> {{candidates for the}} priesthood, those who accept their own sexuality, cannot be considered.|$|E
50|$|Abnormal {{psychology}} {{has studied}} <b>egosyntonic</b> and egodystonic concepts in some detail. Many personality disorders are <b>egosyntonic,</b> which makes their treatment difficult as the patients may not perceive anything wrong and view their perceptions and behavior as reasonable and appropriate. For example, {{a person with}} narcissistic personality disorder has an excessively positive self regard and rejects suggestions that challenges this viewpoint. This corresponds to the general concept in psychiatry of poor insight. Anorexia nervosa, a difficult-to-treat Axis I disorder characterized by a distorted body image and fear of gaining weight, is also considered <b>egosyntonic</b> because many of its sufferers deny {{that they have a}} problem. Problem gambling, however, is sometimes seen as <b>egosyntonic,</b> depending partly on the reactions of the individual involved and whether they know that their gambling is problematic.|$|E

50|$|An {{illustration}} {{of the differences between}} an egodystonic and <b>egosyntonic</b> mental disorder is in comparing obsessive-compulsive disorder and obsessive-compulsive personality disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is considered to be egodystonic as the thoughts and compulsions experienced or expressed are not consistent with the individual's self-perception, meaning the patient realizes the obsessions are unreasonable and are often distressed by their obsessions. In contrast, obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is <b>egosyntonic,</b> as the patient generally perceives their obsession with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, as reasonable and even desirable.|$|E
5000|$|Kernberg {{described}} malignant narcissism as a syndrome {{characterized by}} a narcissistic personality disorder (NPD), antisocial features, paranoid traits, and <b>egosyntonic</b> aggression.

Pollock wrote: [...] "The malignant narcissist is presented as pathologically grandiose, lacking in conscience and behavioral regulation with characteristic demonstrations of joyful cruelty and sadism".|$|E

5000|$|Traditionally, {{procrastination}} {{has been}} associated with perfectionism: a tendency to negatively evaluate outcomes and one's own performance, intense fear and avoidance of evaluation of one's abilities by others, heightened social self-consciousness and anxiety, recurrent low mood, and [...] "workaholism". However, adaptive perfectionists— <b>egosyntonic</b> perfectionism—were less likely to procrastinate than non-perfectionists, while maladaptive perfectionists, who saw their perfectionism as a problem— egodystonic perfectionism—had high levels of procrastination and anxiety.In a regression analysis study of Steel, from 2007, it is found that mild to moderate level of perfectionists typically procrastinate slightly less than others, with [...] "the exception being perfectionists who were also seeking clinical counseling".|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} ways a person may go about {{receiving}} therapy for ego-dystonic sexual orientation associated with homosexuality. There is no known therapy for other types of ego-dystonic sexual orientations. Therapy can be aimed at changing sexual orientation, sexual behaviour, or helping a client become more comfortable with their sexual orientation and behaviours. Human rights groups have accused some countries of performing these treatments on <b>egosyntonic</b> homosexuals. One survey suggested that viewing the same-sex activities as compulsive facilitated commitment to a mixed-orientation marriage and to monogamy. Treatment may include sexual orientation change efforts or treatment to alleviate the stress. In addition, some people seek non-professional methods, such as religious counselling or attendance in an ex-gay group.|$|E
50|$|The {{cause of}} OCPD is unknown. This is a {{distinct}} disorder from obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and {{the relation between the}} two is contentious. Some (but not all) studies have found high comorbidity rates between the two disorders, and both may share outside similaritiesrigid and ritual-like behaviors, for example. Hoarding, orderliness, and a need for symmetry and organization are often seen in people with either disorder. Attitudes toward these behaviors differ between people affected with either of the disorders: for people with OCD, these behaviors are unwanted and seen as unhealthy, being the product of anxiety-inducing and involuntary thoughts, while for people with OCPD they are <b>egosyntonic</b> (that is, they are perceived by the subject as rational and desirable), being the result of, for example, a strong adherence to routines, a natural inclination towards cautiousness, or a desire to achieve perfection.|$|E

40|$|A {{serious problem}} faced by clinicians {{treating}} anorexia nervosa is the <b>egosyntonic</b> {{nature of the}} illness, wherein individuals with anorexia nervosa value their disorder, thereby hindering motivation for recovery and engagement with treatment. The objective of this review article is to elucidate the nature of egosyntonicity in anorexia nervosa, reviewing both qualitative and quantitative research pertaining to this topic, and, importantly, to present methods to overcome this impediment to recovery in anorexia nervosa treatment. The authors elucidate functions of anorexia nervosa for patients, both within psychological and social spheres, as well as highlight the detrimental effect of egosyntonicity in terms of illness severity and motivation for recovery. The final part of the paper contains suggestions as to methods of bypassing pitfalls linked with {{the influence of the}} <b>egosyntonic</b> nature of anorexia nervosa within a treatment setting, as well as an examination of three current treatments (enhanced cognitive-behavioral therapy for eating disorders, Maudsley Model of Anorexia Nervosa Treatment for Adults, and Specialist Supportive Clinical Management) in terms {{of the degree to which}} they target egosyntonicity...|$|E
40|$|This thesis aims {{to examine}} the {{connection}} between aesthetic and ethical valuations. Nietzsche and Freud both claim that values are symptoms of underlying psychical constitutions. I elicit an original understanding of aesthetic and ethical valuations through a synthesis of their works. Beginning with drive theory, I argue that the death-drive is an entropic principle guiding all psychical life. Another original contribution is my conceptualization of Eros as reducible to the death-drive as {{the means by which}} the death-drive manifests itself as a homeodynamic process in open systems. I argue, fundamentally, that the way our drives are expressed in the world entail vicissitudes that are more or less incorporative of stimuli and content as a means of mastery. There is a bifurcation of drive expression concerning incorporation, which I articulate as being egodystonically oriented, {{as in the case of}} defense mechanisms; or egosyntonically oriented, as in the case of sublimation. Sublimation is the only indirect vicissitude that can be regarded as <b>egosyntonic</b> because it involves neither repression nor disavowal. Unlike other vicissitudes, then, sublimation is the vicissitude by which Nietzsche’s emphasis on incorporation is realized. Following my analysis of the various vicissitudes, I demonstrate that there is accordingly a bifurcation of valuations. While most ethical theories involve repudiations of self-interest (our primary drives or inclinations), Nietzsche wants us to return to an incorporation of self-interest and an infusion of it into our relations. His arguments against the ethical theories of Kant and Schopenhauer echo precisely his arguments against their aesthetic theories regarding disinterestedness. I thus discuss the ethical as a corollary of the aesthetic. I conclude describing what it means for aesthetic and ethical valuations to emerge from <b>egosyntonic</b> vicissitudes, and I argue that the Übermensch is ultimately an archetype of <b>egosyntonic</b> relating. Nietzsche illustrates this with the metaphor of dancing...|$|E
40|$|Background: Anorexia nervosa is (AN) {{an eating}} {{disorder}} characterised by the <b>egosyntonic</b> nature of symptoms, denial of illness and d ambivalence about treatment engagement. Thus, AN is a complex and serious psychiatric disorder {{that is associated with}} substantial chronicity, mortality and poor treatment outcomes. It Is poorly understood and the evidence-base for effective treatment remains sparse. This study explored illness perceptions in AN using a qualitative design, which was not restricted by a physical illness model. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|This paper reviews current {{literature}} in which adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) were consulted about {{their views of}} their treatment. Published research was systematically retrieved and interrogated during 2009 – 2010 and analysed using a four-stage model. Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria. Three core themes were identified. AN was perceived {{as a means of}} taking control and also something that controlled the individual. Tensions were recognized between client preferences for psychological interventions and treatments that prioritized physical care. Therapeutic alliance emerged as a strategy for overcoming these difficulties but was challenged by client ambivalence towards treatment. Most included studies were qualitative. Young males and individuals who dropped out of treatment were underrepresented in the studies. Adolescents' perspectives on treatment for AN were characterized by paradoxes and tensions. <b>Egosyntonic</b> theory was used as a theoretical construct to interpret findings...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine psychosocial {{functioning}} in eating disorder (ED) patients with restrictive and purgative subtypes. METHOD: Forty-four adult female {{patients with a}} diagnosis of ED were divided into restrictive (RP) and purgative (PP) groups according the presence of purgative symptoms. Functioning was assessed using the Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST) and the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale (GAF). RESULTS: No {{differences were found in}} total FAST scores or in specific domains between the RP (39. 58 ± 11. 92) and PP (45. 75 ± 11. 75) groups (p = 0. 19). However, PP showed more severe functional impairment than RP in the financial domain (p < 0. 01). There were no differences in comorbidity with mood disorders, depressive symptoms, or general psychiatric symptoms between the two ED subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The similarities found between PP and PR in overall functioning and in autonomy, cognition, work, interpersonal relationships, and leisure seem to reflect the use of an objective scale that corresponds to the clinical impression. In fact, the assessment of psychosocial {{functioning in}} ED patients using self-report instruments requires careful consideration because results may reflect the <b>egosyntonic</b> nature of symptoms commonly observed in these patients, particularly in the restrictive subtype...|$|E
40|$|Objective: {{the main}} {{purpose of this study is}} to {{investigate}} the emotional and temperamental characteristics associated with gambling in Italy and to compare different groups of people on the basis of their risk of gambling: low-risk gamblers, problem gamblers, and pathological gamblers. Particularly, we examined the possible discriminant functions of perception of control, locus of control (whether internal or chance-based; that is, devoted to fate), and emotion-regulation strategies (cognitive reappraisal and expressive suppression). Method: a total of 251 adult regular gamblers (142 males and 109 females) recruited from different betting and bingo halls completed self-report questionnaires on gambling behaviors, lack of control as temperamental dimension, locus of control and emotional regulation strategies. Results: pathological gamblers, in comparison to low-risk gamblers, had lower levels of internal locus of control and cognitive reappraisal and higher levels of chance locus of control. Results from a discriminant function analysis have underlined the presence of two distinct functions: the former, named “unmanageable and stressful fate,” describes an <b>egosyntonic</b> position to gambling; the latter, named “I’d like to resist,” describes the egodystonic position to gambling. Conclusion: findings suggest considering regular gamblers as a heterogeneous group with respect to their attitudes towards their addiction. This can have important implications for their treatment...|$|E
40|$|For many {{individuals}} anorexia plays a functional and <b>egosyntonic</b> role which {{can result in}} reluctance to give it up. However, {{at the same time}} sufferers can also have negative attitudes towards anorexia and this can result in feelings of ambivalence. Pro-anorexia is an online movement which give sufferers a forum to discuss their feelings about wishing to maintain the disorder. This presentation reports the results of an online study which aimed to first determine the understandings of anorexia held by those who wish to maintain it and second, to identify how the understandings may affect pathways to and through treatment. Fourteen participants recruited from pro-anorexic websites took part in either an online focus group or an e-mail interview and data was analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Participants were ambivalent about the role anorexia played in their life: whether it was a ‘tool’, an ‘entity’ or a ‘disease’; whether it was positive or negative; and whether it was a method of control or something that controlled them. Participants also felt ambivalent about whether they wanted to recover. Respondents also discussed barriers to recovery which included feelings of fear and negative attitudes and experiences of treatment. Theoretical and treatment implications of the findings will be discussed as will the methodological implications of using an online approac...|$|E
40|$|Anorexia {{has often}} been theorised {{as a way of}} obtaining a sense of control and a sense of identity. Previous {{research}} has identified the positive functions anorexia plays for those who experience it. Healthcare professionals perceive anorexia as something to be treated whilst those experiencing it are often ambivalent and see it as something to maintain. Those who feel misunderstood in their offline environment can turn to the physically anonymous environment of the internet to discuss their experiences and opinions. The aims of the research were (1) to determine the understandings of anorexia, recovery and treatment through participants’ lived experiences, and (2) to identify how participants’ understandings affected pathways to and through treatment. An online phenomenological approach was used to explore the experiences of those recruited through online resources for anorexia. Data was collected using online focus groups and e-mail interviews and was analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Results indicated a strong theme of maintenance of anorexia due to its <b>egosyntonic</b> and functional role. Anorexia was initially perceived as a solution to problems or crises but over time it became problematic. Nonetheless, strong psychosocial mechanisms such as feelings of ambivalence, an ‘anorexic voice’ and a sense of feeling addicted to anorexia affected its maintenance. Recovery required the acceptance of anorexia as a problem. Recovery was interpreted as a sense of living rather than existing and required four main factors: self-acceptance, acceptance of and from others, the development of alternative, healthy behaviours and the ability to manage residual anorexic cognitions. Implications for treatment are discussed. Online communication is considered a safe environment due to its physical anonymity, allowing people to feel more comfortable disclosing views and experiences that may be stigmatised or uncomfortable to discuss in an offline situation. Future research should utilise the internet in conducting studies with people with body image issues. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|URL] {{students}} of religion suggest that wholeness or {{the attainment of}} an integrated self is an especially valuable goal whose attainment marks a moment of religious insight. Theoreticians like Jung, Allport, and Maslow strongly support this belief. Freud does not. To reconcile the two camps one must either drop Freud altogether or confine his critique of religion to an attack upon neurotic religion, or more exactly, religion based upon superego functioning. One could then claim that healthy religion {{is a function of}} the ego, e. g., the ego's tendency towards integrated functioning and the attainment of "wholeness. " I argue that this ploy, which is itself a function of an <b>egosyntonic</b> desire for wholeness, is altogether wrong. It misrepresents Freud's ego psychology and it therefore misrepresents his critique of the ego's role in religion as well. First, his theoretical, as opposed to his literary, critique of religion is also a critique of certain characteristics of the ego. Second, these characteristics, especially the ego-syntonic drive towards feelings of wholeness, are functions of the ego's obedience to repetition compulsion. Third, the later texts on religion cannot be understood apart from their roots in Freud's earliest theory of ego functioning, especially the physicalist program he developed in his "Project" of 1895. The ego creates and takes part in religious dramas which present an illusory world of wholeness and completion of self. But as the seat of reality testing it must pierce the veils as quickly and as repeatedly as it weaves them. We look in the things we count for an order we can follow in the counting, beginning here and going on this way to end up there; but usually this order is more or less arbitrary, our choice of a sequence where none is unmistakably present. Telling a story we may likewise want to follow the natural succession of events. But it is not in the nature of things that they always come one after another in time; it is owing to the arbitrariness of language that they have to come one after another in the telling.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{constitutes an}} initial {{inquiry into the}} experience of psychological epiphany. In this investigation, the epiphanic experience is conceptualized as one of sudden, discontinuous change, leading to profound, positive, and enduring transformation through the reconfiguration of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s most deeply held beliefs about self and world. To explore {{the nature of the}} epiphanic experience, a qualitative, empirical inquiry was undertaken to determine its fundamental features. Though the generalizability of the findings is limited by the small sample size (five individuals were interviewed indepth), the study revealed a number of characteristic features. The experience was found to be affectively intense, <b>egosyntonic,</b> and profoundly liberating. The experience of epiphany among the participants studied occurred primarily during adolescence or early adulthood, was preceded by a period of internal conflict during which feelings of alienation, anxiety and depression were common, and followed by a period of productive activity and heightened energy. Given the lack of a theoretical framework within which such experiences of discontinuous psychological change could be investigated, two theoretical perspectives originating outside psychology were explored for their applicability. The first, general systems theory, provided a distinction between changes that occur within a system, versus changes to the system as a whole. Systems theory was therefore found to be useful in addressing the impact of epiphanic experiences as experiences which seem to effect changes to an individual 2 ̆ 7 s system of world assumptions. However chaos theory, because it offers a way of distinguishing between different kinds of discontinuous change, was found to provide an even more comprehensive metatheoretical framework within which epiphanies could be conceptualized. Chaos theory holds that significant structural changes to a system which are highly adaptive, often follow from periods of turbulence and seemingly random behavior. Though clinical psychology generally encourages the view that chaos is negative, the findings of the present study suggest that a period of seeming psychological chaos must be carefully evaluated by the clinician as it may be a prelude to important and enduring positive change in an individual 2 ̆ 7 s most basic world assumptions. ...|$|E
