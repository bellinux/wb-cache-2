500|$|His {{hallmark}} was his raw {{voice and}} ability to convey strong emotion. Richie Unterberger of Allmusic noted his [...] "hoarse, gritty vocals, brassy arrangements, an emotional way with both party tunes and aching ballads." [...] In the book Rock and Roll: An Introduction, authors Michael Campbell and James Brody suggested that [...] "Redding's singing calls to mind a fervent black preacher. Especially in up-tempo numbers, his singing is more than impassioned speech but less than singing with precise pitch." [...] According to the book, [...] "Redding finds a rough midpoint between impassioned oratory and conventional singing. His delivery overflows with emotion" [...] in his song [...] "I Can't Turn You Loose". Booker T. Jones described Redding's singing as energetic and emotional, but said that his vocal range was limited, reaching neither low nor high notes. Peter Buckley, in The Rough Guide to Rock, describes his [...] "gruff voice, which combined Sam Cooke's phrasing with a brawnier delivery" [...] and later suggested he [...] "could testify like a hell-bent preacher, croon like a tender lover or <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> dirty with a bluesy yawp".|$|E
500|$|Because of his {{aggressive}} style-of-play, Selwood {{has gathered}} {{a reputation as}} a [...] "head–over–the–ball specialist" [...] and for consistently putting himself in positions to break tackles and win free kicks. His ability to [...] "buckle his knees, (<b>get)</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> pull his arm up so that the tackler's arm goes up above the neck" [...] has been declared by former Hawthorn captain Shane Crawford as [...] "almost impossible to stop at times" [...] and is reflected in his regular standing among league leaders for total free kicks received. It has also led to opposition players noting specific techniques to tackling Selwood—Carlton’s Kade Simpson admitted it was important to [...] "get in low" [...] because [...] "he’s such a master at lifting the elbows, which tries to slip the tackle up around the neck ... there’s no doubt it’s a skill". Selwood has declared the technique as a [...] "benefit and an advantage I’m getting at the moment on someone else because I see a weakness in what they are doing ... the majority of the time they are doing 95 per cent of the tackle right. It’s just that five per cent where I can use my upper body strength, I can dip at the knees slightly". Former Brisbane Lions captain Michael Voss agrees, stating [...] "all he’s doing is keeping his feet, dropping his legs and he’s got a fantastic tenchique in rolling his shoulder ... Selwood shouldn’t be penalised because he’s stronger than the tackler. If I was playing today and I could develop that technique, I’d be looking at it".|$|E

2500|$|In Flora Fountain, {{vehicles}} carrying mail {{were stopped}} and the mail burnt. British men and women going in cars and victorias were made to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> shout [...] "Jai Hind" [...] (Victory to India). Guns were trained on the Taj Mahal Hotel, the Yacht Club and other buildings from morning till evening. After {{the outbreak of the}} mutiny, the first thing the mutineers did was to free B.C. Dutt (who was arrested during General Auchinleck’s visit). Then they took possession of Butcher Island (where the entire ammunition meant for Bombay Presidency was stocked).|$|E
2500|$|According to Peter Guralnick, for Elvis and {{the guys}} [...] "Hollywood was just an open {{invitation}} to party all night long. Sometimes they would hang out with Sammy Davis, Jr., or check out Bobby Darin at the Cloister. Nick Adams and his gang came by the suite all the time, {{not to mention the}} eccentric actor Billy Murphy ..." [...] When Buzz Cason asked Lamar Fike [...] "how Elvis did it – this partying nearly every night," [...] he [...] "answered, 'A little somethin' to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> a little something to get up.' Obviously, {{he was referring to the}} pills that started a trend that sadly in only a few years would lead to Elvis's untimely death." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 14, 2007, Stephen Harper shuffled MacKay from Foreign Affairs to Defence, {{replacing}} Gordon O'Connor. On November 6, 2007, {{while attending}} {{a meeting at}} Forward Operating Base Wilson, 20 kilometres west of Kandahar City, Mackay was unharmed as two rockets struck the base at about 11 a.m. local time. Mackay described the incident: [...] "There was an explosion. It was a loud bang", said MacKay. [...] "When it happened, we heard the explosion, we heard the whistle overhead, {{we were told to}} <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> we did." [...] The incident happened {{on the same day that}} a suicide bomber detonated an explosive in Baghlan in the northeastern part of the country killing at least 35 including several politicians. While Taliban insurgents were suspected of being behind the bombing, it was not believed to be related to the attack in Kandahar.|$|E
2500|$|The Tender Trap {{arrived in}} a vibrant period for eclectic {{contemporary}} clubs in Sydney, including Spicy Friday, Jamie and Vanessa's, The Sunset Club, Madd Club, Club Kooky, <b>Get</b> <b>Down,</b> <b>and</b> the bohemian Rat Parties. But from the beginning, The Tender Trap was aiming to recapture the vibe of swinging sixties Sydney in the perfect venue, [...] "a celebration of cocktail culture at its most sophisticated and savage". The Tender Trap referenced legendary Sydney clubs of an earlier era such as Chequers, The Latin Quarter, the Silver Spade Room, and Tabou. The essential mix was live cabaret entertainment, together with DJs playing their cherished vinyl LP collections featuring lounge music, jazz, Latin, funk, soul, and the incredibly strange. The original fixtures of the room were embraced and enhanced, including red cloth-covered tables, candles, chandeliers, velvet flock wallpaper, and the central focus – the cabaret stage. The effect was remarkably like stepping back in time. Every Sunday the running order was fixed – from 7pm cocktails, laid back music, and sophisticated discussion; then the live act at 10.30 pm; and then the wild dancing commenced.|$|E
2500|$|In the Jets' postgame press conference, Sanchez explained: [...] "I was {{thinking}} a different play in my head. That was a mental error there. As soon as I {{realized there was}} no one to hand it to I started to run toward the line and tried to cover it up and just <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I slid right into Brandon Moore." [...] "I was just trying to get down. The play was over. Say 'Uncle'. Do the right thing. Get to second-and-10 and live to play another down. I'm not a big believer in luck, but that was pretty unlucky. It was really too bad." [...] In an interview six days later, Sanchez described the play again: [...] "It's embarrassing. You screw up the play and I'm trying to do the right thing. It's not like I'm trying to force something. I start to slide and I slide in the worst spot I possibly could—right into Brandon Moore. I guess (I was) more stunned than anything. Just like a car accident. I was like, 'Whoa. What just happened?' Then, the ball's gone. It was weird." ...|$|E

2500|$|Yamada is a {{high school}} girl who is best {{described}} as oversexed, flirtatious and lustful. She is particularly vain and is unabashed in flaunting her looks in public. Her goal in high school is {{to have sex with}} 100 guys; however, her insecurities as a virgin causes her to turn down any advances. She believes the first step towards realizing her dreams is to lose her virginity to an inexperienced boy; this leads her to pursue Takashi Kosuda after she accidentally falls on him at the bookstore. Through the course of the series, Yamada tries to make advances on Kosuda, and becomes overly jealous whenever other girls interact with him. She eventually acknowledges she has feelings for him. Despite living at home with her younger sister, Yamada is unashamed in her licentious habits. She is an excellent student, although that is partly attributed to her ability to read and memorize articles about sex. At the conclusion of the manga series, author Yoko Sanri noted that she never managed to reveal Yamada's given name. Rebecca Silverman of Anime News Network describes her as [...] "single-minded in her determination to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> dirty" [...] and [...] "rather refreshing to see a girl so comfortable with her sexuality and wants, even if we don't share them". [...] Yamada is voiced by Yukari Tamura in Japanese, and by Brittney Karbowski in English.|$|E
2500|$|A Roadblock is a {{task that}} only one team member may perform. A Roadblock clue is given as a cryptic question, such as [...] "Who's really hungry?" [...] (leading to task {{involving}} exotic food) or [...] "Who wants to <b>get</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> dirty?" [...] (for a task related to laundry). Based on this information and observation of any other racers at the task, the team must decide which member will complete the task before reading the full task description. Once a team announces its decision of who will complete the Roadblock, it cannot be taken back. The Roadblock task is performed only by the selected racer while his or her partner waits in a designated area, although the partner is usually able to supply words of encouragement and advice. Further, unless directed by the task instructions, the selected racer can gain help from other racers that have been selected to do the Roadblock or from locals. Some Roadblocks may involve the non-selected racer, such as leading a camel his or her partner rides, or helping his or her partner solve a puzzle. On completing the Roadblock, the selected racer receives their next clue which they then return to their partner to read. If a racer cannot finish a Roadblock, or opts to quit the Roadblock, the team must take a four-hour penalty, which either starts when the next team arrives at the roadblock, or if all teams are present, when they reach the Pit Stop for that leg. Some legs feature two Roadblocks, often {{the first and the}} final legs when this occurs. The second Roadblock in such cases generally require that the non-participating racer from the first Roadblock perform that one.|$|E
