5000|$|In 1808 Douglas was {{commanding}} the brig-sloop [...] and captured four privateers within as many months. He subsequently served under Captain Charles Dashwood at the capture, towards {{the close of}} 1808, {{of the town of}} Samana, St. Domingo. On his passage to England he captured the French schooner Mouche, on 9 March 1809. He co-operated with Commodore Edward Owen's advanced division in the <b>East</b> <b>Scheldt</b> during the Walcheren Campaign.|$|E
50|$|On 28 July of {{the same}} year Squire took part in the Walcheren Campaign. He sailed, as {{commanding}} Royal Engineer to Sir John Hope's division, with the army under the Earl of Chatham to the River Scheldt. On 30 July he reconnoitred the channel and shores of the <b>East</b> <b>Scheldt</b> with Captain Peake, R.N.. He took part in the siege of Vlissingen, and was present at its capture on 14 August, returning to England in December.|$|E
50|$|Both Pliny and Ptolemy's Geography {{are unclear}} {{concerning}} the exact {{position of the}} Tungri but are understood as placing them <b>east</b> of the <b>Scheldt,</b> and {{to the north of}} the Arduenna Silva (Forest of Ardennes), along the middle and lower valley of the Mosa (Meuse River).|$|R
50|$|The 1st Polish Armoured Division enjoyed greater {{success to}} the east as it {{advanced}} northeast from Ghent. In country unsuitable for armour, and against stiffening resistance, the Division advanced to the coast by September 20, occupying Terneuzen and clearing the south bank of the <b>Scheldt</b> <b>east</b> toward Antwerp.|$|R
50|$|In Belgium, a bunder {{was used}} as unit of area {{in the part of}} the country {{historically}} belonging to the Holy Roman Empire (i.e. <b>east</b> of the <b>Scheldt).</b> In general, one bunder was 1/12 of a mansus.During the French occupation (1796-1815) the old measurement standards were accurately converted to the metric system. A general standard like the one in the Netherlands (1 bunder = 1 hectare) has never been adopted in Belgium.|$|R
40|$|Six {{species of}} Copepoda Poecilostomatoida of the {{families}} Myicolidae, Sabelliphilidae, Lichomolgidae, and Mytilicolidae are recorded from six different species of intertidal bivalves in the <b>East</b> <b>Scheldt</b> (The Netherlands), {{a branch of the}} southern bight of the North Sea. One bivalve species may harbour more than one species of copepod, and one copepod species may use more than one species of bivalves as host. Mytilicola orientalis and Myicola ostreae are new to the North Sea, both being undoubtedly carried in accidentally with oriental oysters, successfully introduced for mariculture. In the light of the damage that was caused by Mytilicola intestinalis to Dutch mussel cultures in the past, the acclimatization of M. orientalis is a matter of concern, the more so since it infests not only its original oriental host, Crassostrea gigas, but also the native European species, Ostrea edulis and Mytilus edulis, both important fisheries resources in the <b>East</b> <b>Scheldt</b> region...|$|E
50|$|Gertrude {{and her son}} withdrew to {{the islands}} of Frisia (Zeeland), leaving William to occupy the disputed lands. In 1063 Gertrude married Robert of Flanders (Robert the Frisian), the second son of Baldwin V of Flanders. Baldwin gave Dirk the Imperial Flanders as an appanage - {{including}} the islands of Frisia west of the Frisian Scheldt river. Robert then became his stepson's guardian, gaining control of the islands <b>east</b> of the <b>Scheldt.</b> Robert managed to conquer Kennemerland (north of North Holland), but held it only briefly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{island was}} {{attacked}} from three directions: across the causeway from the <b>east,</b> across the <b>Scheldt</b> from the south, and by sea from the west.The 2nd Canadian Infantry Division attacked the causeway on October 31. An initial {{attack by the}} Black Watch (Royal Highland Regiment of Canada) was rebuffed; The Calgary Highlanders then sent a company over which was also stopped halfway across the causeway. A second attack by the Highlanders {{on the morning of}} November 1 managed to gain a precarious foothold; a day of fighting followed, and then the Highlanders were relieved by Le Regiment de Maisonneuve who struggled to maintain the bridgehead. The [...] "Maisies" [...] withdrew onto the Causeway on November 2, to be relieved by the 1st Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders of the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division. In conjunction with the waterborne attacks, the 52nd continued the advance.|$|R
50|$|A {{fair share}} (but not most) of these territories were {{inherited}} by the Burgundian dukes, a younger {{branch of the}} French royal House of Valois in 1384, upon the death of Count Louis II of Flanders. His heiress, Margaret III of Flanders in 1369 had married Philip the Bold, youngest son of King John II of France and {{the first of the}} Valois dukes of Burgundy at Dijon, who thus inherited the County of Flanders. The Flemish comital House of Dampierre had been French vassals, who held territory around the affluent cities of Bruges and Ghent, but also adjacent lands in former Lower Lorraine <b>east</b> of the <b>Scheldt</b> river ("Imperial Flanders") including the exclave of Mechelen, which were a fief of the Holy Roman Empire, and furthermore the neighbouring French County of Artois. Together they initiated an era of Burgundian governance in the Low Countries.|$|R
40|$|The Paardenmarkt is {{a marine}} shoal, located two {{kilometers}} {{east of the}} Zeebrugge harbour (51 ° 20 ’N- 03 ° 16 ’E), in water depths varying between 3 - 7 m. This site {{is characterized by the}} presence of shallow biogenic gas. Moreover, this site forms a dangerous area for shipping and fishing because it was used as a dumpsite for WWI bombs. For this reason, the understanding of the sedimentary transport is important to estimate the future evolution of this site. This study combines acoustic data (side-scan sonar, single- and multibeam, acoustic doppler current profiler), current modeling and grain-size analysis of surficial sediment samples to evaluate the relative contribution of the hydrodynamic and morphological effects on the sedimentary transport in the area. The hydrodynamic results show a dominance of the flood tidal current for the entire study area. However, locally near the Scheldt Estuary, the ebb current dominates as an effect of the Scheldt outflow. Based on the grain-size analysis, a sediment map is made in combination with the seabed morphology and permits a classification of 5 sediment types. The residual sediment transport, based on the grain-size data, is estimated by a numerical model (Gao and Collins, 1991) and is related to seabed features observed on the acoustic data (side-scan sonar and multibeam). Four different sedimentary transport zones are distinguished with this method: Ä	in {{the western part of the}} study area, the flood currents dominate and influence the sedimentary transport;Ä	in the southern part, the gyre created behind the Zeebrugge harbour influences the sedimentary transport;Ä	in the central part, no significant residual transport is observed;Ä	to the <b>east,</b> near the <b>Scheldt</b> Estuary, the sedimentary transport is influenced by the amplification of the ebb currents. This amplification is due to a minimal addition of freshwater and the contrasted morphology of the estuary, which canalizes and accelerates the ebb current. This case study was carried out in the framework of an evaluation study of the anthropogenic influence of the harbour construction between 1954 - 2000. Due to the construction of the harbour, a gyre is generated resulting in a sedimentary accretion south and erosion north of the Paardenmarkt site...|$|R
