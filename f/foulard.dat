5|$|Popular myth {{has it that}} a US Army {{airplane}} {{had flown}} over Villalba {{on the day of}} the invasion and dropped a yellow silk <b>foulard</b> marked with a black L (indicating Luciano). Two days later, three American tanks rolled into Villalba after driving thirty miles through enemy territory. Don Calogero climbed aboard and spent the next six days traveling through western Sicily organizing support for the advancing American troops. As General Patton's Third Division moved onward the signs of its dependence on Mafia support were obvious to the local population. The Mafia protected the roads from snipers, arranged enthusiastic welcomes for the advancing troops, and provided guides through the confusing mountain terrain.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of FN electoral success, the {{immigration}} debate, growing concerns over Islamic fundamentalism, and the fatwa against Salman Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini, the 1989 affaire du <b>foulard</b> {{was the first major}} test of the relations between the values of the French Republic and Islam. Following the event, surveys found that French public opinion was largely negative towards Islam. In a 1989 legislative by-election in Dreux, FN candidate Marie-France Stirbois, campaigning on an anti-Islamism platform, returned a symbolic FN presence to the National Assembly. By the early 1990s, some mainstream politicians began employing anti-immigration rhetoric. In {{the first round of the}} 1993 legislative elections the FN soared to 12.7% of the overall vote, but did not win a single seat due to the nature of the electoral system (if the election had used proportional representation, it would have won 64 seats).

40|$|Jean Baubérot, The Affair of the Scarves and Secular Education in France The {{prohibition}} of head coverings (scarves) in French high schools {{has been a}} test of the principles of secular education in France which permits an analysis on three levels. First, the dynamics of dissent are revealed as transcending traditional political or ideological positions. Second, defenders of secular education have formed a consensus in favor of the prohibition, even if they disagree on how to do it. Third, the traditional conflict in France between Catholics and secularists has been overcome in favor of secular education. However, this development implies a conspiracy of silence regarding the crisis of secularism in general and, in particular, on the issue of "secular morality". Baubérot Jean.

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the secularism debate {{currently}} taking place in France by examining how this issue impacts the integration of immigrants, particularly Muslim immigrants. Secularism {{is one of the}} key values of French Republicanism, but one which has been challenged by the establishment of a settled population of Muslim immigrants in France. The issue has been particularly highlighted by the affaire des <b>foulards</b> (headscarf affair), an ongoing debate over the rights of Muslim girls to wear a headscarf to secular French schools. Discussions of the principle of secularism and of its application have been even more intense in recent months with the publication in December 2003 of a report by the Stasi Commission, a commission set up by President Chirac to investigate the application of the principle of secularism, and by the passage of legislation intended to outlaw the wearing of any "overt" religious insignia in French schools. This article examines these recent developments in the context of the long-running debate over Muslim women's right to wear a headscarf in French schools. It argues that the current focus on secularism provides evidence of the return of assimilation as a primary objective of public policy (Brubaker, 2001) and the decreasing strength of the movement in favour of the droit à la différence (right to difference). Finally, the paper argues that this has provided important obstacles to the integration of certain groups of immigrants, particularly Muslim immigrants...|$|R

The industry had burgeoned after the Civil War: only four of the thirty four silk exhibitors (representing America 2 ̆ 7 s two hundred twenty four silk manufacturers and dealers) could trace their origins to the 2 ̆ 2 times which tried the souls of the silk producers and manufacturers. 2 ̆ 2 The Nonotuck Silk Company, the unlikely descendant of the 18302 ̆ 7 s moth-to-cloth Northampton Silk Company, was one that could and did. After falling twice from the rickety carousel of early nineteenth century enterprises, it seized the brass ring and held on. The key to its success was its manufacture of the first usable 2 ̆ 2 machine twist, 2 ̆ 2 a silk thread strong and smooth enough to withstand the unprecedented demands of the newly invented sewing machine. Nonotuck became one of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s leading silk thread manufactures and Northampton 2 ̆ 7 s largest employer for decades. Yet the details of this key invention have never been spelled out. This paper attempts to fill that gap. The sericulture years: 1830 - 1850. The story begins, not in 1838 as the trade card suggests, but eight years earlier, when Samuel Whitmarsh, a 30 -year-old Boston native, bought a large estate near the center of Northampton with the proceeds of a successful tailoring business in New York and built cocoonery for two million silkworms and two greenhouses for mulberry shoots next to his mansion. Raising silkworm was a popular spring pastime in Northampton in the 18202 ̆ 7 s; Whitmarsh tugged the silkworm from cottage to factory, from hobby to industry. A former linseed oil mill three miles three miles to the north along the Mill River served as his first factory. A few years later, backed by a group of New York and Connecticut financiers, Whitmarsh built a four-story brick one nearby. The new 7 factory hummed with up-to-the-minute machinery. Tourists flocked to see his power loom churn out silk ribbons and vesting. The Northampton Silk Company was incorporated in 1838. But some whispered that the manufacture was mostly a show to persuade the gullible to invest in mulberry trees, whose price increased tenfold in a few short years. The Northampton Silk Company burst with the mulberry bubble. Bankrupt, Whitmarsh withdrew in 1840. Out but not down, he tried, again unsuccessfully, to establish a silk industry in Jamaica a few years later. At the time of his death, in Northampton in 1875, he was planning to raise silk in California...|$|R

She was dressed in some blue <b>foulard</b> stuff, with lace at the throat, and lace cuffs to the elbow. She was tall and supple; her hair had a curling fluffiness very charming.

60|$|Philip made up {{his mind}} to dislike her thoroughly. She spoke with a slight French accent; and he did not know why she should, since she had been born and bred in the heart of England. He thought her smile affected, and the coy sprightliness of her manner irritated him. For two or three days he {{remained}} silent and hostile, but Miss Wilkinson apparently did not notice it. She was very affable. She addressed her conversation almost exclusively to him, and there was something flattering in the way she appealed constantly to his sane judgment. She made him laugh too, and Philip could never resist people who amused him: he had a gift now and then of saying neat things; and it was pleasant to have an appreciative listener. Neither the Vicar nor Mrs. Carey had a sense of humour, and they never laughed at anything he said. As he grew used to Miss Wilkinson, and his shyness left him, he began to like her better; he found the French accent picturesque; and at a garden party which the doctor gave she was very much better dressed than anyone else. She wore a blue <b>foulard</b> with large white spots, and Philip was tickled at the sensation it caused.|$|E
60|$|The washerwoman lost no time {{in showing}} up, {{although}} her charges have been greatly reduced. She formerly demanded nearly treble {{as much as in}} London; now, however, she makes only sixteen to twenty shillings a month, not bad pay in a place where living costs threepence, and comfortable living sixpence, a day. These nymphs of the wash-tub are painfully familiar and plain. The dress is a bright cotton <b>foulard</b> bound on like the anatomy of a turban and garnished, as were our grandmothers' nightcaps, with huge front bows. Gaudy shawls cover white cotton jackets; and skirts of bright, showy longcloth suggest the parrot or the cockatoo. The ornaments are large gold earrings and necklaces of beads or coral. I could not but remark the difference of tone. There was none of the extreme 'bumptiousness' and pugnacious impudence of twenty years ago; indeed, the beach-boys, nowhere a promising class, were rather civil than otherwise. Not a single allusion to the contrast of 'white niggahs and black gen'lemen.' Nor did the unruly, disorderly African character ever show itself, as formerly it often did, by fisticuffing, hair-pulling, and cursing, with a mixture of English and Dark-Continent ideas and phraseology, whose tout ensemble was really portentous.|$|E
60|$|The Empress and {{the little}} Grand Duchess wore simple suits of <b>foulard</b> (or <b>foulard</b> silk, I don't know which is proper,) with a small blue spot in it; the dresses were trimmed with blue; both ladies wore broad blue sashes about their waists; linen collars and {{clerical}} ties of muslin; low-crowned straw-hats trimmed with blue velvet; parasols and flesh-colored gloves. The Grand Duchess had no heels on her shoes. I do not know this of my own knowledge, but one of our ladies told me so. I was not looking at her shoes. I was glad to observe that she wore her own hair, plaited in thick braids {{against the back of}} her head, instead of the uncomely thing they call a waterfall, which is about as much like a waterfall as a canvas-covered ham is like a cataract. Taking the kind expression that is in the Emperor's face and the gentleness that is in his young daughter's into consideration, I wondered if it would not tax the Czar's firmness to the utmost to condemn a supplicating wretch to misery in the wastes of Siberia if she pleaded for him. Every time their eyes met, I saw more and more what a tremendous power that weak, diffident school-girl could wield if she chose to do it. Many and many a time she might rule the Autocrat of Russia, whose lightest word is law to seventy millions of human beings! She was only a girl, and she looked like a thousand others I have seen, but never a girl provoked such a novel and peculiar interest in me before. A strange, new sensation is a rare thing in this hum-drum life, and I had it here. There was nothing stale or worn out about the thoughts and feelings the situation and the circumstances created. It seemed strange--stranger than I can tell--to think that the central figure in the cluster of men and women, chatting here under the trees like the most ordinary individual in the land, was a man who could open his lips and ships would fly through the waves, locomotives would speed over the plains, couriers would hurry from village to village, a hundred telegraphs would flash the word to the four corners of an Empire that stretches its vast proportions over a seventh part of the habitable globe, and a countless multitude of men would spring to do his bidding. I had a sort of vague desire to examine his hands and see if they were of flesh and blood, like other men's. Here was a man who could do this wonderful thing, and yet if I chose I could knock him down. The case was plain, but it seemed preposterous, nevertheless--as preposterous as trying to knock down a mountain or wipe out a continent. If this man sprained his ankle, a million miles of telegraph would carry the news over mountains --valleys--uninhabited deserts--under the trackless sea--and ten thousand newspapers would prate of it; if he were grievously ill, all the nations would know it before the sun rose again; if he dropped lifeless where he stood, his fall might shake the thrones of half a world! If I could have stolen his coat, I would have done it. When I meet a man like that, I want something to remember him by.|$|E

They were a remarkable couple, Lyon thought, and {{as he looked at}} the Colonel standing in bright erectness before the chimney-piece while he emitted great smoke-puffs he did not wonder that Everina could not regret she had not married him. All the gentlemen collected at Stayes were not smokers and some of them had gone to bed. Colonel Capadose remarked that there probably would be a smallish muster, they had had such a hard day's work. That was the worst of a hunting-house--the men were so sleepy after dinner; it was devilish stupid for the ladies, even for those who hunted themselves--for women were so extraordinary, they never showed it. But most fellows revived under the stimulating influences of the smoking-room, and some of them, in this confidence, would turn up yet. Some of the grounds of their confidence--not all of them--might have been seen in a cluster of glasses and bottles on a table near the fire, which made the great salver and its contents twinkle sociably. The others lurked as yet in various improper corners of the minds of the most loquacious. Lyon was alone with Colonel Capadose for some moments before their companions, in varied eccentricities of uniform, straggled in, and he perceived that this wonderful man had but little loss of vital tissue to repair.|$|E

The world belongs to youth, and so it ought to be the best thing for itself in it. Youth is a very curious thing, and in that it is like spring, especially like the spring we have just been having, to our cost. It is the only period of life, as spring is the only season of the year, that has too much time on its hands. Yet {{it does not seem to}} waste time, as age does, as winter does; it keeps doing something all the while. The things it does are apparently very futile and superfluous, some of them, but in the end something has been accomplished. After a March of whimsical suns and snows, an April of quite fantastical frosts and thaws, and a May, at least partially, of cold mists and parching winds, the flowers, which the florists have been forcing for the purpose, are blooming in the park; the grass is green wherever it has not had the roots trodden out of it, and a filmy foliage, like the soft <b>foulard</b> tissues which the young girls are wearing, drips from the trees. You can say it is all very painty, the verdure; too painty; but you cannot reject the picture because of this little mannerism of the painter. To be sure, you miss the sheeted snows and the dreamy weft of leafless twigs against the hard, blue sky. Still, now it has come, you cannot deny that the spring is pretty, or that the fashionable colors which it has introduced are charming. It is said that these are so charming that a woman of the worst taste cannot choose amiss among them. In spite of her taste, her hat comes out a harmonic miracle; her gown, against all her endeavors, flows in an exquisite symphony of the tender audacities of tint with which nature mixes her palette; little notes of chiffon, of tulle, of feather, blow all about her. This is rather a medley of metaphors, to which several arts contribute, but you get my meaning?"

If not yet of her world, he knew now that his becoming so would be hereafter purely a matter of time. He looked up through the green leaves at the blue sky, bedappled with white, fleecy clouds, and wondered whether she guessed that his appearance here, his ownership of Iris, the studious care with which he had placed himself in the hands of a Seville Row tailor were all for her sake. It was true that she had condescended to Bohemianism, that he had first met her as a journalist, working for her living in a plain serge suit and a straw hat. But he felt sure that this had been to a certain extent a whim with her. He stole a sidelong glance at her--she was the personification of daintiness from the black patent shoes showing beneath the flouncing of her skirt, to the white hat with its clusters of roses. Her <b>foulard</b> gown was as simple as genius could make it, and she wore no ornaments, save a fine clasp to her waistband of dull gold, quaintly fashioned, and the fine gold chain around her neck, from which hung her racing-glasses. She was to him the very type of everything aristocratic. It might be, as she had told him, that she chose to work for her living, but he knew as though by inspiration that her people and connections were of that world to which he could never belong, save on sufferance.
