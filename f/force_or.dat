5|$|In {{the case}} of the weak interaction, fermions can {{exchange}} three distinct types of force carriers known as the W+, W−, and Z bosons. The mass of each of these bosons is far greater than the mass of a proton or neutron, which is consistent with the short range of the weak force. The force is in fact termed weak because its field strength over a given distance is typically several orders of magnitude less than that of the strong nuclear <b>force</b> <b>or</b> electromagnetic force.|$|E
5|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, anti-feminism was mainly focused on {{opposition}} to women's suffrage. Later, opponents of women's entry into {{institutions of higher}} learning argued that education was too great a physical burden on women. Other anti-feminists opposed women's entry into the labour <b>force,</b> <b>or</b> their right to join unions, to sit on juries, or to obtain birth control and control of their sexuality.|$|E

5|$|Newton's Third Law is {{a result}} of {{applying}} symmetry to situations where forces {{can be attributed to the}} presence of different objects. The third law means that all forces are interactions between different bodies, and thus that there is no such thing as a unidirectional <b>force</b> <b>or</b> a force that acts on only one body.|$|E
5|$|Some Scout Groups offer special Scouting {{programmes}} called Air Scouts and Sea Scouts. Both programmes {{follow the}} same core programme in all sections but can add more aeronautical or nautical emphasis depending on the programme, with some Groups choosing to be recognised by the Royal Air <b>Force</b> <b>or</b> Royal Navy. In the United Kingdom there are approximately 400 Sea Scout Groups, of which about 25% (101 Groups) are Royal Navy recognised, whilst of 117 Air Scout Groups, 43 are recognised by the RAF.|$|E

5|$|A 3 January 1992 ceasefire {{allowed the}} {{implementation}} of the Vance plan, which protected civilians in areas designated as UN Protected Areas (UNPAs) and deployed UN peacekeepers in Croatia. One of the UNPAs defined by the plan, UNPA Western Slavonia, encompassed parts of the municipalities of Novska and Nova Gradiška and all of Daruvar, Grubišno Polje and Pakrac. This UNPA covered the area held by the JNA on 3 January, additional territory to the north (recaptured by the HV in late 1991) and towns never under SAO Western Slavonia control (such as Grubišno Polje and Daruvar). The peacekeeping force (United Nations Protection <b>Force,</b> <b>or</b> UNPROFOR), initially expected to be 10,000-strong, began its deployment on 8 March.|$|E
5|$|A world map is {{available}} and, at the beginning, the player is allocated {{one of the}} twenty regions of a fictional, idyllic country to destroy. As the player progresses through these regions, each representing a level, the areas previously conquered will appear ransacked, twisted, and evil. The goals for each level are straightforward: they generally fall {{along the lines of}} eliminating the heroic <b>force</b> <b>or</b> destroying all other Dungeon Keepers. The first few levels are tutorials, teaching the player the basics. Special items are hidden throughout certain levels. Such items perform actions such as increasing the player's creatures' experience level, or revealing the map. They can reveal a hidden level, where the player must perform a specific task, and is rewarded upon completion.|$|E

5|$|As supercells and {{multi-cell}} thunderstorms dissipate {{due to a}} weak shear <b>force</b> <b>or</b> poor lifting mechanisms, (e.g. considerable terrain or lack of daytime heating) the {{gust front}} associated with them may outrun the squall line itself and the synoptic scale {{area of low pressure}} may then infill, leading to a weakening of the cold front; essentially, the thunderstorm has exhausted its updrafts, becoming purely a downdraft dominated system. The areas of dissipating squall line thunderstorms may be regions of low CAPE, low humidity, insufficient wind shear, or poor synoptic dynamics (e.g. an upper level low filling) leading to frontolysis.|$|E

These regulations, as well as providing guidance for members of the public, specify forms of dress {{for a wide variety of}} office-holders and public officials, clergy, the judiciary, members of the Royal Household, etc. It also includes provision for Scottish dress to be worn.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{the weak}} interaction (the weak <b>force</b> <b>or</b> weak nuclear force) is {{the mechanism of}} interaction between sub-atomic particles that causes radioactive decay and thus plays {{an essential role in}} nuclear fission. The theory of the weak interaction is sometimes called quantum flavourdynamics (QFD), in analogy with the terms quantum chromodynamics (QCD) dealing with the strong interaction and quantum electrodynamics (QED) dealing with the electromagnetic force. However, the term QFD is rarely used because the weak force is best understood in terms of electro-weak theory (EWT).|$|E

5|$|Inaugurated at Ottawa, Canada, in October 1939, EATS {{was a plan}} {{to expand}} the Royal Air Force's (RAF) {{capacity}} to train aircrews by creating a pool of personnel from various Commonwealth countries—Australia, Canada, Britain and New Zealand—through {{the establishment of a}} common training system consisting of a series of initial, elementary, and advanced training schools. At the conclusion of advanced training, personnel were posted as required to RAF-controlled squadrons in Britain or the Middle East. These squadrons were designated as either RAF, RAAF, Royal Canadian Air <b>Force</b> <b>or</b> Royal New Zealand Air Force squadrons, but were paid for and administered by the British government, and personnel could be drawn from any Commonwealth nation. Seventeen RAAF squadrons were formed during the war under Article XV of the agreement.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate predators include crabs, starfish and octopuses. Crabs {{crack the}} shells with their pincers and starfish use their water {{vascular}} system {{to force the}} valves apart and then insert part of their stomach between the valves to digest the bivalve's body. It has been found experimentally that both crabs and starfish preferred molluscs that are attached by byssus threads to ones that are cemented to the substrate. This was probably because they could manipulate the shells and open them more easily when they could tackle them from different angles. Octopuses either pull bivalves apart by <b>force,</b> <b>or</b> they bore a hole into the shell and insert a digestive fluid before sucking out the liquified contents.|$|E
5|$|Judicial oratory {{had become}} a {{significant}} literary genre by {{the second half of}} the fifth century, as represented in the speeches of Demosthenes' predecessors, Antiphon and Andocides. Logographers were a unique aspect of the Athenian justice system: evidence for a case was compiled by a magistrate in a preliminary hearing and litigants could present it as they pleased within set speeches; however, witnesses and documents were popularly mistrusted (since they could be secured by <b>force</b> <b>or</b> bribery), there was little cross-examination during the trial, there were no instructions to the jury from a judge, no conferencing between jurists before voting, the juries were huge (typically between 201 and 501 members), cases depended largely on questions of probable motive, and notions of natural justice were felt to take precedence over written law—conditions that favoured artfully constructed speeches.* H.
