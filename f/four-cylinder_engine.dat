5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E

25|$|Though other {{manufacturers}} had marketed the transverse, overhead camshaft, inline <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> configuration and the layout {{had been used}} in racing engines prior to World War II, Honda popularized the configuration with the CB750, and the layout subsequently became the dominant sport bike engine layout.|$|E
25|$|Rover's {{plans to}} use its then fairly new 2.2L <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> were soon {{abandoned}} as BL management ruled that substantially redesigned versions of Triumph's six-cylinder engine were to power the car instead. The Rover V8 engine was fitted in the engine bay. The three-speed automatic gearbox was the BorgWarner 65 model.|$|E

25|$|The initial diesel models {{used the}} M51 straight-six {{turbo-diesel}} engine. In 1998, its successor the M57 was introduced, however the M51 also remained in production {{for two more}} years. In 1999, the M47 four-cylinder turbo-diesel {{was introduced in the}} 520d model, which is the only E39 model to use a <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{facelift}} {{was designed}} at Daewoo's Worthing Technical Centre in England and introduced in South Korea in late 2000, and exported from 2001. The front-end structure was modified {{to accommodate a}} <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine,</b> although the introduction of this engine, the 1.0-litre S-Tec unit, was delayed until after Daewoo's takeover by General Motors in 2002.|$|E
50|$|The Arrow {{family of}} engines are modular {{in design and}} share the same pistons, {{cylinders}} and gearboxes assembled around different crankcase designs, giving one-, two- or <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engines.</b> Arrow engines {{are no longer in}} production.|$|R

The vehicle went on sale in 2014-01-11.|$|E
25|$|The Model D, circa 1909, was {{a smaller}} {{car with a}} <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> with 28-horsepower and fitted with five-passenger touring, close coupled, double rumble-seated runabout, landaulet and {{limousine}} bodies. It had a high-grade runabout chassis. The limousine sold for $4,000 in 1909. This model with a surrey body type sold for $2,700 in 1909 and the touring car was priced at $2,800.|$|E
25|$|American Motors devoted {{three years}} to the {{development}} of a new <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> The brand new engine was designed to use AMC's existing spacing between the cylinder bores so that the tooling remained the same. The location of other major components, such as the distributor, oil filter, and starter were also kept the same to so as to use the machine tools for the AMC straight-6 engine.|$|E
50|$|In late 2006, an {{extension}} of the cooperation between the two groups was announced, promising new <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> without further details.|$|R
50|$|There {{were four}} general petrol engine {{variants}} between 1979 and 1991, with several sub-models. All were overhead-valve push-rod horizontally opposed <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engines.</b> Available engine options differed between regions. Aftermarket VW specialist Oettinger also offered the WBX6, a six-cylinder version.|$|R
50|$|The Jaguar Land Rover Ingenium 2.0-litre <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engines</b> used in Jaguar XE {{is built}} at their new engine plant near Wolverhampton in Staffordshire.|$|R
25|$|Under {{development}} for a year, the CB750 had a transverse, straight-four engine {{with a single}} overhead camshaft (SOHC) and a front disc brake, neither of which was previously available on a mainstream, affordable, production motorcycle. Having a <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> and disc brake, along with the introductory price of US$ (US$ in current money), gave the CB750 a considerable sporting performance advantage over its competition, particularly its British rivals.|$|E
25|$|The first company formed {{exclusively}} to build automobiles was Panhard et Levassor in France, which also introduced the first <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine.</b> Formed in 1889, Panhard was quickly followed by Peugeot two years later. By {{the start of}} the 20th century, the automobile industry was beginning to take off in Western Europe, especially in France, where 30,204 were produced in 1903, representing 48.8% of world automobile production that year.|$|E
25|$|In 1898, de Dietrich debuted the Torpilleur (Torpedo) racer, which {{featured}} a <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> and independent suspension in front, for the Paris-Amsterdam Trial; Gaudry wrecked en route, but still placed third. The response was substantial, exceeding one million gold francs. The 1899 torpilleur was less successful, despite underslung chassis, a rear-mounted monobloc four, and twin carburettors; poor preparation left {{none of the}} works teams able to complete the Tour de France.|$|E
50|$|Later {{models were}} more {{conventional}} with two- or <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engines,</b> {{but the market}} for high wheelers was disappearing and the company folded in 1910.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: IKCO EF <b>Engines</b> are <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engines.</b> The EF7 {{series are}} {{designed}} jointly by Iran Khodro Powertrain Company (IPCO) and F.E.V GmbH of Germany.|$|R
50|$|The Type 8 {{and later}} Type 9 were {{automobiles}} designed by Ettore Bugatti for the Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik in 1907. These used long-stroke <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1990 the Premier was {{substantially}} re-engineered. Standard were 4-wheel {{disc brakes}} and {{a stainless steel}} exhaust system. The electrical system was replaced with standard Chrysler parts {{that proved to be}} more reliable than the original Renix system. The exterior was changed slightly, the Design Giugiaro badges being removed from the front fenders as a result. The (unpopular) <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> was officially dropped from the lineup, with the V6 remaining as the sole engine.|$|E
25|$|Two of {{the major}} {{disadvantages}} of this process are the high cost and long development time. An automotive part can take four years to develop; {{two years in the}} prototype stage and two years to reach production. Not all products take this long, for instance a two-way valve produced by Johnson Controls only took 18 months. The initial cost can be as much as US$8 million to produce a <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> manifold. However, computer flow analysis has helped reduce lead time and costs.|$|E
25|$|The Benz Patent-Motorwagon and the Ford Model T used a {{trembler}} {{coil ignition}} system. A trembler coil was a battery-powered induction coil; the trembler interrupted the current through the coil and caused a quick series of sparks during each firing. The trembler coil would be energized at an appropriate {{point in the}} engine cycle. In the Model T, the <b>four-cylinder</b> <b>engine</b> had a trembler coil for each cylinder; a commutator (timer case) delivered power to the trembler coils. The Model T would be started on battery but then switched to an alternator.|$|E
