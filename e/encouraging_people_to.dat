5|$|From early on, ascetics {{have played}} a major role in the Swaminarayan sect.

The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, later commented that Christians initially burnt the records, but later decided to destroy them with hammers through fear of breathing in the melting vinyl's fumes. The protests were not restricted to the US, with Christian organisations preventing Iron Maiden from performing in Chile in 1992.|$|E

However, the regular diet of Welsh people has been more influenced by India, China and America. The most popular dish is chicken tikka masala, followed by burgers or chow mein. As a result of the popularity of these sorts of foods, Wales has the highest fat consumption in Britain, and the highest levels of obesity.|$|E

The government also announced plans to build new sewage treatment plants. The administration plans to construct 60 million toilets by 2019.

When Eliot deals with the past in The Dry Salvages, he emphasises its importance to combat the influence of evolution as <b>encouraging</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> forget the past and care only about the present and the future. The present is capable of always reminding one of the past.

5|$|Complaints of {{low back}} pain {{are one of the}} most common reasons people visit doctors. For pain that has lasted only a few weeks, the pain is likely to subside on its own. Thus, if a person's medical history and {{physical}} examination do not suggest a specific disease as the cause, medical societies advise against imaging tests such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs. Individuals may want such tests but, unless red flags are present, they are unnecessary health care. Routine imaging increases costs, is associated with higher rates of surgery with no overall benefit, and the radiation used may be harmful to one's health. Fewer than 1% of imaging tests identify the cause of the problem. Imaging may also detect harmless abnormalities, <b>encouraging</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> request further unnecessary testing or to worry. Even so, MRI scans of the lumbar region increased by more than 300% among United States Medicare beneficiaries from 1994 to 2006.|$|E
5|$|More than 9.2 {{million people}} {{signed up for}} care on the {{national}} exchange (healthcare.gov) for 2017, down some 400,000 from 2016. This decline was due primarily to the election of President Trump, who pulled advertising <b>encouraging</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> sign up for coverage, issued an executive order that attempts to eliminate the mandate, and has created significant uncertainty {{about the future of}} the ACA. Enrollments had been running ahead of 2016 prior to President Obama leaving office, with 9.8 million expected to sign-up, so President Trump's actions potentially cost about 600,000 national enrollments (i.e., 9.8 million expected − 9.2 million actual = 0.6 million impact). Of the 9.2 million, 3.0 million were new customers and 6.2 million were returning. The 9.2 million excludes the 11 states that run their own exchanges, which have signed up around 3 million additional people. These figures also exclude the additional coverage due to the Medicaid expansion, which covers another approximately 10 million persons, as described in the impact section above.|$|E
