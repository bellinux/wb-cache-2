40|$|<b>Knee</b> flexion <b>angle</b> {{is used to}} {{determine}} saddle height during pedaling. However, {{it is unclear how}} <b>knee</b> flexion <b>angle</b> at upright standing posture affects measures and interpretation of <b>knee</b> flexion <b>angle</b> during cycling. The objective {{of this study was to}} highlight the importance of adjusting <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> during pedaling according to the <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> at upright posture. Seventeen cyclists performed three 10 min cycling trials at different saddle heights to induce <b>knee</b> flexion <b>angles</b> (40 º, 30 º or 20 º when crank was at the 6 o’clock position). <b>Knee</b> flexion <b>angle</b> was determined at the sagittal plane during cycling using a 2 D motion analysis system. Alteration of saddle height was performed by subtracting the knee flexion determined during an upright standing posture from the observed knee flexion during cycling. Repeatability of <b>knee</b> <b>angles</b> at upright posture in the three trials was very good (ICC= 0. 73). A reduction in <b>knee</b> flexion <b>angle</b> of 10. 6 ° (95 %CI [8. 6, 12. 6 º]) during cycling was found using the adjustment for upright standing posture (p 3. 0). As a result, saddle height is affected by adjustments based on <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> measured in upright standing posture. Determining saddle height without adjusting <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> for upright standing posture could lead to errors with possible effects on performance and/or injury risk...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. [Purpose] The aim of {{this study}} was to verify how the {{application}} of elastic tape to the anterior surface of the thigh changes the <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> pattern during gait. [Subjects] The subjects were 10 people who showed an abnormal <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> change pattern during usual walking. They did not show the so-called double knee action. [Methods] Subjects were asked to walk as usual, and then to walk with elastic tape attached to the anterior surface of the thigh. The <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> was measured during gait with an electronic goniometer. We graphed the temporal changes of the <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> and compared them with the normal gait pattern. [Results] The <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> gait pattern of six of the 10 subjects improved after application of the tape and became like a normal gait pattern. The changes in the <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> resulted from a stimulus via the skin, rather than voluntary muscular adjustment, suggesting that the changes may have originated due to differences in reflexive tensile strength. [Conclusion] In normal speed gait, it is suggested that the <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> was altered such that it exhibited a normal pattern by applying elastic tape to the anterior surface of the thigh.

40|$|AbstractWork {{presented}} in this paper discusses the effect of <b>knee</b> <b>angle,</b> during the block phase of the start, on overall start performance using the Omega OSB 11 block. Omega claims that the footrest enables the athlete to push-off with a rear <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> of 90 °, which is beneficial to starting performance. Published work to date supports the positive effect of starting performance using the footrest, compared to blocks without a footrest, however, reference is not specifically made to the <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> of the athlete beyond set-up. Ten male, national-level, sprint swimmers were asked to perform maximal start trials using three different footrest configurations. Force and video data were collected for each trial at a rate of 125 Hz. Analysis of the data focused on the effect of <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> at set-up, on horizontal and vertical peak forces. For these data the best starts produced a peak vertical force at a rear <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> of 80 °- 90 °.

Objective: The main objective {{of this study was}} to determine the normal developmental limits of the <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> in normal Saudi children as well as to compare between girls and boys regarding the {{development of}} the <b>knee</b> <b>angle.</b> Methods: The present investigation was carried out on 300 Saudi normal children having the age range of 2 - 12 years. The subjects were selected from both sexes (150 girls and 150 boys) and were selected from nurseries and schools of five different areas in Riyadh city. The subjects in each gender were divided according to their age into ten age groups. The <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> was assessed by measuring the tibiofemoral angle, the intercondyler distance and the intermalleolar distance. The used instruments were goniometer, tape measure and caliper. Results: There was a tendency of knock knee in children aging from 2 to 12 years which decreased towards normal lower extremity alignment with age increment for both sexes. There was no significant differences between girls and boys regarding the tibiofemoral angle, the intercondyler distance and the intermalleolar distance (p= 0. 605, 0. 510 and 0. 630 respectively).

40|$|CONTEXT: A passive knee-extension {{test has}} been shown to be a {{reliable}} method of assessing hamstring tightness, but this method does not take into account the potential effect of gravity on the tested leg. OBJECTIVE: To compare an original passive knee-extension test with 2 adapted methods including gravity's effect on the lower leg. DESIGN: Repeated measures. SETTING: Laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: 20 young track and field athletes (16. 6 ± 1. 6 y, 177. 6 ± 9. 2 cm, 75. 9 ± 24. 8 kg). INTERVENTION: Each subject was tested in a randomized order with 3 different methods: In the original one (M 1), passive <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> was measured with a standard force of 68. 7 N (7 kg) applied proximal to the lateral malleolus. The second (M 2) and third (M 3) methods took into account the relative lower-leg weight (measured respectively by handheld dynamometer and anthropometrical table) to individualize the force applied to assess passive <b>knee</b> <b>angle.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Passive <b>knee</b> <b>angles</b> measured with video-analysis software. RESULTS: No difference in mean individualized applied force was found between M 2 and M 3, so the authors assessed passive <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> only with M 2. The mean <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> was different between M 1 and M 2 (68. 8 ± 12. 4 vs 73. 1 ± 10. 6, P <. 001). <b>Knee</b> <b>angles</b> in M 1 and M 2 were correlated (r =. 93, P <. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Differences in <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> were found between the original passive knee-extension test and a method with gravity correction. M 2 is an improved version of the original method (M 1) since it minimizes the effect of gravity. Therefore, we recommend using it rather than M 1...|$|R
40|$|Triceps surae {{muscles are}} {{mechanically}} connected by the shared Achilles tendon and by epimuscular myofascial connections. We aimed {{to assess the}} effects of proximal lengthening of gastrocnemius and plantaris muscles, imposed by changes in <b>knee</b> <b>angle,</b> on the magnitude {{and direction of the}} 3 D ankle moment exerted by the soleus muscle and the mechanical interaction between ankle plantar flexor muscles during co-activation of gastrocnemius muscle, in the rat (N= 9). Ankle angle was kept constant (90 deg), whereas <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> was varied between 60 deg and 130 deg. At each <b>knee</b> <b>angle,</b> the soleus muscle was excited individually as well as simultaneously with the gastrocnemius muscle (SO+GA). The mathematical sum of individual soleus and gastrocnemius ankle moments was compared with the ankle moment exerted by SO+GA to assess nonlinear summation. <b>Knee</b> <b>angle</b> did not affect the magnitude of the soleus ankle moment (P= 0. 695). Moment directions in the transverse (P= 0. 050) and frontal (P= 0. 008) planes were affected by <b>knee</b> <b>angle,</b> but dissection indicated that this was not caused by length changes of the two-joint synergistic muscles. Nonlinear summation was found in the magnitude (- 1. 4 ± 1. 9 %, mean±s. d., P< 0. 001) and in the frontal plane vector direction of the ankle moment (0. 13 ± 0. 23 deg, P= 0. 003); however, the extent did not change with <b>knee</b> <b>angle.</b> Although contraction of SO+GA increased the length of the Achilles tendon compared with its length at rest, this was not dependent on the <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (P= 0. 649).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the rear <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> range in the set position that allows sprinters to reach greater propulsion on the rear block during the sprint start. Eleven university-track team sprinters performed the sprint start using three rear <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> conditions: 90 °, 115 ° and 135 °. A motion capture system consisting of 8 digital cameras (250 Hz) was used to record kinematic parameters at the starting block phase and the acceleration phase. The following variables were considered: horizontal velocity of the centre of mass (COM), COM height, block time, pushing time on the rear block, percentage of pushing time on the rear block, force impulse, push-off angle and length of the first two strides. The main results show that first, horizontal block velocity is significantly greater at 90 ° vs 115 ° and 135 ° rear <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (p< 0. 05 and p< 0. 001 respectively) at block clearance and the first two strides; second, during the pushing phase, the percentage of pushing time of the rear leg is significantly greater at 90 ° vs 135 ° rear <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (p< 0. 01). No significant difference was found for block time among the conditions. These results indicate that block velocity is the main kinematic parameter affected by rear <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> during the starting block phase and acceleration phase. Furthermore, the 90 ° rear <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> allows for a better push-off of the rear leg than larger angles at the set position.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{relative}} involvement of four muscles - rectus abdominis, external obliques, rectus femoris, and the lumbar region of sacrospinalis - during performances of eight different variations of the sit-up exercise. The sit-up variations investigated were long-lying sit-ups with/without feet support and hook-lying sit-ups with <b>knee</b> <b>angles</b> of 65, 90, and 105 degrees with/without feet support. Twenty-seven male volunteers between the ages of 20 and 36 years participated as subjects in the investigation. Myoelectric activity was monitored using an Orion Computerized System with a pair of surface electrodes positioned over each of the four muscles on the right side of the body. A clear plastic goniometer was aligned over the hip, knee, and ankle joints to measure <b>knee</b> <b>angle.</b> Three repetitions of each sit-up variation were performed, with sit-up variations administered to each subject in random order. One minute of rest was given between sit-up variations to minimize the influence of fatigue. A two-way ANOVA with repeated measures on both factors was used to evaluate differences in myoelectric activity levels. The main factors were feet support (supported/unsupported) and <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (long-lying or hooklying with 65, 90, and 105 degree <b>knee</b> <b>angle).</b> Statistical significance (p <. 05) of mean differences were tested using the statistical software BMDP 2 V on the CYBER mainframe computer. Tukey's HSD or Bonferroni pairwise comparisons were used for evaluation of significant F values for knee ankle, while the Scheffe procedure was used to evaluate significant interaction effects. Sit-ups with feet unsupported produced significantly greater myoelectric activity than with feet supported in all selected muscle groups except the rectus femoris, where the reverse was true. The hook-lying sit-up with larger <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> produced significantly greater myoelectric activity in the external obliques and the sacrospinalis. In the external oblique, only the mean comparison of long-lying vs. hooklying sit-up with 105 degree <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> showed a significant interaction difference. Increased <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> in hook-lying sit-ups resulted in increased involvement of the abdominal muscles. Myoelectric activity at the sacrospinalis site was greater with increasing <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> and with the feet unsupported. These findings can be utilized by physical education instructors and by physicians in educating their students and patients as to the relative efficacy of the situp variations investigated...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: There is {{uncertainty}} as {{to which}} <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> during a squat jump (SJ) produces maximal jump performance. Importantly, understanding this information will aid in determining appropriate ratios for assessment and monitoring of the explosive characteristics of athletes. Method: This study compared SJ performance across different knee angles— 90 º, 100 º, 110 º, 120 º, 130 º, and a self-selected depth—for jump height and other kinetic characteristics. For comparison between SJ and an unconstrained dynamic movement, participants also performed a countermovement jump from a self-selected depth. Thirteen participants (Mage = 25. 4 ± 3. 5 years, Mheight = 1. 8 ± 0. 06 m, Mweight = 79. 8 ± 9. 5 kg) were recruited and tested for their SJ performance. Results: In the SJ, maximal jump height (35. 4 ± 4. 6 cm) was produced using a self-selected <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (98. 7 ± 11. 2 °). Differences between 90 °, 100 °, and self-selected <b>knee</b> <b>angles</b> for jump height were trivial (ES ± 90 % CL = 90 °– 100 ° 0. 23 ± 0. 12, 90 °–SS − 0. 04 ± 0. 12, 100 °–SS − 0. 27 ± 0. 20; 0. 5 – 2. 4 cm) and not statistically different.

Methods: All participants were children with spastic cerebral palsy (n= 10) who walked with knee flexion in midstance. Data were collected over 2 - 5 sessions, at 3 -monthly intervals. A-Fdf ROM was quantified using a custom-designed hand-held ankle dynamometer that exerted 4. Nm at the ankle. Ankle-foot and <b>knee</b> <b>angles</b> during gait were quantified on sagittal video recordings. Linear regression (cross-sectional analysis) and General Estimation Equation analysis (longitudinal analysis) were performed to assess relationships between (change in) A-Fdf ROM and (change in) ankle-foot and <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> during gait. Results: Cross-sectional analysis showed a positive relationship between A-Fdf ROM and both ankle-foot angle in midstance and terminal swing. Longitudinal analysis showed a positive relationship between individual decreases in A-Fdf ROM and increases of knee flexion during gait (lowest <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> in terminal stance and angle in terminal swing).

In the past a more prominent role of the VM muscle at more extended <b>knee</b> <b>angles</b> has been put forward. However, different components of the quadriceps muscle converge via a common distal tendon. We therefore hypothesized that the relative contribution of the VM to total knee extension torque would be similar across angles. Methods: At each <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> the EMG isometric torque relations [20 %, 25 %, 30 %, 35 % maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) ] of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL) and VM muscle were established in 10 healthy male subjects; rectified surface EMG was normalized to M-wave area. Subsequently, the VM was functionally eliminated by selective electrical surface stimulation with occluded blood flow. Results: There was no evidence for preferential activation of VM {{at any of the}} <b>knee</b> <b>angles.</b> Following VM elimination, total knee extension torque during maximal femoral nerve stimulation (three pulses at 300 Hz) at 10 °, 30 °, 60 ° and 90 °, respectively, decreased (P 0. 05 among <b>knee</b> <b>angles).</b> In addition, during voluntary contractions at 20 % MVC the increases in torque output of RF and VL compensating for the loss of VM function were calculated from the increases in EMG and found to be similar (P > 0. 05) at 10 °, 30 °, 60 ° and 90 ° values (%MVC), respectively, were: 9. 1 ± 6. 8, 7. 5 ± 2. 9, 5. 9 ± 3. 7 and 6. 9 ± 3. 4. Conclusion: The present findings support our hypothesis that the VM contributes similarly to total knee extension torque at different <b>knee</b> <b>angles.</b> © 2008 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of {{anterior cruciate ligament}} (ACL) injuries for soccer players are non-contact. Women have {{a higher incidence of}} non-contact ACL injury than men. One of the five most important factors associated with these non-contact injuries is when the plant leg knee flexes to less than 30 °. Women soccer players have also been reported to flex the knee less than men when planting to take a shot. While soccer is mainly played on natural grass (NG) fields, playing on artificial turf (AT) surfaces is becoming increasingly popular because of the many benefits including low maintenance. Recently some data has suggested that knee injury incidence rates are higher on artificial turf than natural grass. Purpose: To determine if playing surface has an effect on men and women soccer players’ plant leg <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> when performing maximal effort power (PS) and finesse (FS) shots. Methods: Sixteen collegiate soccer players (8 female, 8 male, age = 20. 17 ± yrs, mass = 73. 67 ± kg, height = 162. 41 ± cm) performed four different shooting conditions (3 PS on artificial turf, 3 PS on natural grass, 3 FS on artificial turf, 3 FS natural grass). Participants performed a 15 yd maximal effort dribble into a 5 yd x 5 yd cone box to complete the shot. A wireless electrogoniometer and accelerometer were attached to each participant in order to collect plant leg <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> kinematics as well as tibial acceleration at 200 Hz. Separate 2 x 2 (field surface x gender) Repeated Measures ANOVAs were used to analyze data collected from each shot type. Results: The mean (sd) <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (degrees) for men, on grass and turf fields during the power shot were 29. 3 °(11. 4 °) and, 28. 6 °(8. 1 °), respectively. The <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> for women on grass and turf fields for the power shot were 26. 8 °(3. 8 °), and 31. 9 ° (18. 7 °), respectively. The mean (sd) <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (degrees) for men on grass and turf fields during the finesse shot were 30. 8 ° (13. 1 °) and 28. 7 ° (8. 6 °), respectively. The <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> for women on grass and turf fields for the finesse shot were 24. 0 ° (6. 5 °), and 24. 3 ° (6. 3 °), respectively. Field surface had no significant effect on <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> of the plant leg during the power (F(1, 14) = 0. 251, p = 0. 624) or finesse (F(1, 14) = 0. 082, p = 0. 779) shots. Furthermore, plant leg <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> were similar between genders during the power (F(1, 14) = 0. 012, p = 0. 913) and finesse (F(1, 14) = 3. 128, p = 0. 099) shots. Lastly, there was no significant interaction between field condition and sex on the plant leg <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> during the power (F(1, 14) = 0. 431, p = 0. 522) and finesse (F(1, 14) = 0. 141, p = 0. 713) shots. Conclusion: A more extended knee on the plant leg {{has been shown to be}} one factor that is associated with knee injuries in soccer. Data from this study suggests that playing surface had no effect on plant leg knee kinematics for either men or women suggesting that either surface is acceptable for play with respect to plant leg knee kinematics...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} tilt table incline and <b>knee</b> flexion <b>angle</b> {{on the degree of}} weight bearing and forces exerted across the supporting straps. DESIGN: A quantitative and exploratory study to {{investigate the}} effects of a mechanical procedure. SETTING: Physiotherapy gymnasium. SUBJECTS: Twelve healthy subjects (9 female, 3 male) aged 22 - 45 years. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects stood on a tilt table, on two occasions, with simulated contractures of 10 degrees and 40 degrees knee flexion. Nine tilt angles, between 10 degrees and 90 degrees, were maintained for 1 minute each in random order. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Force was recorded from single-point load cells placed under the feet, and at knee and chest straps. RESULTS: The degree of simulated knee contracture (10 degrees or 40 degrees) influenced the distribution of forces at different recording sites. Weight bearing increased with table incline and was significantly less with the 40 degrees than the 10 degrees <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (p < 0. 001). Conversely, forces across the knee straps were systemically higher with the 40 degrees <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (p < 0. 0001). The effects were accentuated by greater body weight. Forces across the chest strap also increased with tilt and were significantly larger with the 40 degrees <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> (p < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: The relationships between table incline, <b>angle</b> of <b>knee</b> flexion and distribution of forces generated during tilt table standing have been quantified and described. Standing with flexed knees involved less weight bearing under the feet and greater force exerted across the supporting straps. These effects were more pronounced at the higher <b>knee</b> <b>angle</b> and with greater body weight, and could be modified by reducing table inclin...|$|R
