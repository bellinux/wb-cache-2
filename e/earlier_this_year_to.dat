It places a particular focus on identifying changes in use between devices. A nationally representative sample of n= 1, 001 New Zealanders, 18 years of age or older, was interviewed for this survey by telephone. When we compare the results with those of the same survey last year, there are 3 key trends: 	There is a growing trend towards people owning or having access to multiple mobile devices. 	More people are using Smartphones and tablets/iPads <b>this</b> <b>year</b> than they were last year.

LPI has committed over seven million dollars for capital investment in the Survey Infrastructure Improvement Project – the majority of which will be invested in the CORS network – plus additional funds to operate the network. A strong team of eight technical and customer support staff was formed <b>early</b> <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>to</b> handle the development and operation of the network as well as the introduction of user fees. A new network name, CORSnet-NSW, was announced in June 2009 to reflect the new effort. With 28 sites currently operational, the team aims to expand the network to 70 sites within the next four years. Concluding a competitive and comprehensive tender process, a contract was awarded in June 2009 to deliver LPI with VRS 3 Net, the latest generation of CORS network management software from Trimble Navigation. The deployment of VRS 3 Net in CORSnet-NSW will significantly enhance the range and quality of services that LPI can provide to its customers. LPI aims to integrate VRS 3 Net with its existing accounting and delivery systems, which is a first for this system. Currently, fully-fledged network control centres are being built at the Land and Property Management Authority’s (LPMA) data centres in Sydney and Bathurst. Once completed, these control centres will provide a fully redundant network with future-proof capabilities for many <b>years</b> <b>to</b> come. <b>This</b> new infrastructure will also enable a wide range of research projects in the areas of geodesy, surveying, positioning, navigation and telecommunications.

International collaborations based on such initiatives can facilitate studies on new biomarkers in MS.
