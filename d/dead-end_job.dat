500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} positive reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, wrote: [...] "A superb episode. Some colorful background for Homer and Marge (and a glimpse of Homer and Barney's schooldays) plus our introduction {{to the world of}} the McBain films. Excellent." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson thought the episode was a [...] "fine program", and added that Lovitz made Artie [...] "amusingly annoying". Jacobson thought the episode captured the [...] "tone of the mid-Seventies with warmth and insight", and the courtship [...] "seemed charming but not sappy, and the show worked well overall." [...] Jacobson's favorite line of the episode was Grampa's advice to Homer about Marge, [...] "Oh, son, don’t overreach! Go for the dented car, the <b>dead-end</b> <b>job,</b> the less attractive girl!" [...] When Homer arrives at the Bouvier house to pick up Marge for the prom, Selma tells Patty [...] "Marge's dates get homelier all the time," [...] to which Patty replies [...] "That's what you get when you don't put out." [...] Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought these were the best lines of the episode. IGN ranked Lovitz as the eighth best guest star in the show's history.|$|E

He sought romance, but his advances were rejected by a co-worker and he felt nervous around women. He believed that he brought too much pain to his loved ones. He grew angry and frustrated at his difficulties in finding a girlfriend and he took up obsessive gambling. Unable to pay back gambling debts, he took a cash advance and then defaulted on his repayments. He then began looking for a state without heavy government regulation or high taxes. He became enraged when the government told him that he had been overpaid $1,058 while in the Army and he had to pay back the money.

30|$|To sum up, low-wage {{jobs are}} not always <b>dead-end</b> <b>jobs.</b> However staying in the “wrong” kind of firm or {{occupation}} can make low-wage employment persistent.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new {{test for the}} family investment hypothesis (FIH). We show that a simple two-period labor supply model produces testable implications on the work hours and occupational choices for married women. In credit-constrained households, married women …nancially support their families by working in <b>dead-end</b> <b>jobs</b> that do not necessarily require much skill. The support decreases as their families overcome credit-constraints. We analyze the occupation choices for married women using a …rst-order Markov switching model. Our …ndings, based on the matched March Current Population Survey (CPS) for 1996 - 2002, {{are consistent with the}} FIH. We replicate the annual hours worked speci…cations used in previous papers and demonstrate that the conventional results get reversed when the sample is con…ned to women who work in <b>dead-end</b> <b>jobs...</b>|$|R

40|$|The wage {{progression}} of less skilled workers {{is of particular}} policy interest in light of evidence of skill-biased technology changes. There exist two conflicting views regarding the wage {{progression of}} less skilled workers. One view believes that work experience {{is the driving force}} for wage growth of less skilled workers, so effective policies should encourage workers to participate in the labour market and accumulate work experience. The other view stresses that less skilled workers are usually locked into <b>dead-end</b> <b>jobs</b> in which wages are stagnant and policies that facilitate job shopping (changing jobs and employers) would be desirable. Job tenure is a key factor in testing the hypothesis that less skilled workers are locked into <b>dead-end</b> <b>jobs.</b> If the return to tenure is zero, the hypothesis cannot be rejected. An extended human capital model of wage growth for less skilled workers is estimated using data from the Survey of Labour and Income Dynamics (SLID) 1993 to 1998. In order to compare the wage growth mechanisms for workers with different skill endowments, the model is also estimated for workers with higher skill levels. The result implies that the return to job tenure for less skilled workers is significantly different from zero. This is inconsistent with the view that less skilled workers are locked into <b>dead-end</b> <b>jobs.</b> The return to job tenure is also found to be greater than the return to total labour market experience for less skilled workers. This finding supports the notion that firm-specific human capital acquired by less skilled workers substitutes for their generally low human capital endowments and the accumulation of firm-specific human capital by less skilled workers greatly improves their earnings prospect.

Many shots are located in stairwells and in borrowed flats whose tenants are hostile toward or unaware of the decor, making them seem disconnected from cultural touchstones and their place in their homes.

40|$|<b>Dead-end</b> <b>jobs</b> can {{be defined}} as a line of work in ones early work history that leads to lower long-run wages. This study shows how early lines of work predict long-run worker wages and finds that there are {{significant}} differences in this relationship based on the skill level of the worker. In general, service-producing lines of work appear to penalize long-run wages, especially for low-skilled workers. Low-skilled workers in retail food/foodservice lines of work rank about {{in the middle of the}} spectrum between <b>dead-end</b> <b>jobs</b> and stepping stones. Long-run wage potential is better in retail food/foodservice than in manufacturing/operative jobs. On the other hand, early experience in retail food/foodservice leads to lower long-run wages, all else equal, compared to early experience in a professional services industry (other than health) and a non-business professional occupation. Overall, this research provides evidence that early line of work matters to a workers long run wages at all skill levels; there is little difference between men and women. These results are based on analyzing data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979. Long term wages, early occupations, retail food, foodservice, Labor and Human Capital,...|$|R
