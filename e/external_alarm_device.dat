50|$|The {{enuresis}} alarm methodology {{originated from}} French and German physicians {{in the first}} decade of the 20th century.

Despite early success, the treatment was not developed until the 1930s by two independent groups of psychologists: Orval Mowrer and Willie Mae Mowrer (1938) and John Morgan and Frances Witmer (1939). Mowrer used a modified Pfaundler <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> with 30 children (ages 3-13 years) showing empirical success of the bell and pad method as a treatment for nocturnal enuresis, with the maximum time required to accomplish the treatment not exceeding two months.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—One of {{the most}} {{important}} causes of accidents is driver fatigue. To reduce the accidental rate, the driver needs a quick nap when feeling sleepy. Hence, searching for the minimum time period of nap is a very challenging problem. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold, i. e. to investigate the possible fastest time period for nap and its relationship with stage 2 sleep, and to develop an automatic stage 2 sleep detection and <b>alarm</b> <b>device.</b> The experiment for this investigation is designed with 21 subjects. It yields the result that waking up the subjects after getting into stage 2 sleep for 3 - 5 minutes can efficiently reduce the sleepiness. Furthermore, the automatic stage 2 sleep detection and <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> yields the real-time detection accuracy of approximately 85 % which is comparable with the commercial sleep lab system.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine if and how the social service and the social welfare {{secretary}} provides against threat and violence in the encounter with clients. The study is qualitative and carried out with six semi-structured interviews with social welfare secretaries and participation observations at the social welfare offices in three municipalities. The theoretical starting points used were symbolic interactionism and strange loops. The result shows that social service and social welfare secretaries both use measures to prevent threat and violence to occur. The precautionary measures mainly used by social services are; looked doors, <b>alarm</b> <b>device,</b> loose objects removes and interview rooms are furnish in purpose for the social welfare secretary to flee the room at urgent need. Measures used by the social welfare secretary where focusing on their manner of behaving in their encounter with clients. Some of the important factors where to act respectful, professional, calmly, honestly and to posses`knowledge. The result also shows that measures such as looked doors, removing loose objects and the use of <b>alarm</b> <b>device</b> might be perceived by clients as insulting, provocative, a feeling of being inferior and losing control of their situation. The study implies that an increased knowledge of if and how the surroundings and the precautionary measures used by social service affect clients.
