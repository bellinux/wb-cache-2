40|$|On the Swedish Island of Bjorko, {{that today}} lies in Lake Malaren, is the Viking Age (eighth-tenth century) town of Birka. Between 1871 and 1895 Hjalmar Stolpe {{excavated}} approximately 1100 graves {{in the vast}} grave-fields lying outside the walls of this town. Stolpe 2 ̆ 7 s excavations provided not {{only one of the}} richest quarries for the archaeological interpretation of the Viking Age but revealed the diversity of the approximately 600 - 900 inhabitants who lived in this international trading town. Among these approximately 1100 graves, were a group of male graves that contained a various array of splendid silk textiles, embroideries and trimmings in gold and silver, bronze and lead buttons, bronze belt mounts, and gold and silver brocaded tabletwoven bands. The confusion surrounding the bulk of these extant textiles and their accessories is their possible Near and Far Eastern provenance. Because of these exotic finds, Birka is known as the Silk Road of the North. My most recent research has been focused on the brocaded tabletwoven bands from the male graves. An examination of these tabletwoven bands and their comparison to other Scandinavian and Western brocaded bands will be the purpose of this paper. I will begin with some cursory background information on the known trade and travel of the Eastern Vikings; that is, those Vikings living in Sweden and Russia who were known as the Rus 2 ̆ 7. This will help to explain the wide variety of possibilities for the provenance of these items. I will then introduce the tablet woven bands, explore their unique materials, and finally, compare them to other extant bands through warp threads, <b>ground</b> <b>weft</b> threads, metallic brocade weft threads, and motifs in an effort to discover their possible provenance. I have recently examined the majority of the brocaded tablet woven bands from both male and female graves that are now conserved at the Statens Historiska Museum in Stockholm. This examination confirmed materials and patterns. I have yet to compare the quality of the weave structures between Groups I and II...|$|E

The Sources There are several Arab accounts that note particulars about the trade, travel, and physical appearance of the Eastern Vikings. Ibn Khordadhbeh, in c. 885 CE, writes about Vikings sailing down the Caspian Sea and exiting at 2 ̆ 2 Djordjân. 2 ̆ 2 He explains that they would then pack their merchandise on camels and using eunuchs as interpreters, would make their way to Baghdad. Perhaps the most famous account of the Vikings comes to us from Ibn Fadlan who describes his meeting with the Rus 2 ̆ 7 at a Northern Bulgar settlement on the Volga in 922 CE. His famous description of a chieftain 2 ̆ 7 s funeral includes details about his attire and available textiles. The dead chief wore pants, slippers, ankle-length boots, a tunic, a brocaded caftan with gold buttons, and a brocaded hat trimmed in Marten fur. He was carried out to a pavilion built in his ship and placed on a Byzantine brocade-covered couch. These accounts clearly indicate that Vikings had access to foreign merchandise. Another contemporary course comes from Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus, a learned Byzantine Emperor who ruled from 905 - 959 CE. He wrote De administrando imperio in c. 944 CE. In this book he includes an account of the trade route the Rus 2 ̆ 7 used to get from Novgorod, Smolensk, Teliutza, Chernigov, and Vyshegrad, to Byzantium along the Dnieper river. This information confirms the use of at least this one route from the North to the Mediterranean and includes details of ship building, portaging, and travel time...|$|E
5000|$|Interlocking method - two wefts are {{interlocked}} {{with each other}} where the colour change is required. The figuring weft is made {{of a number of}} coloured threads, weaving plain with warp threads and interlocked on either side with the <b>grounds</b> <b>weft</b> threads are invariably gold threads which interlock with the figure weft threads, thus forming the figure. This system of interlocking weaves, known as kadiyal, is done so that there are no extra floats {{on the back of the}} motif thus making the design nearly reversible.|$|R
5000|$|Structurally, samite is a weft-faced {{compound}} twill, plain or figured (patterned), {{in which}} the main warp threads are hidden {{on both sides of}} the fabric by the floats of the <b>ground</b> and patterning <b>wefts,</b> with only the binding warps visible. By the later medieval period, the term samite was applied to any rich, heavy silk material which had a satin-like gloss, indeed [...] "satin" [...] began as a term for lustrous samite.|$|R
2500|$|Of {{the five}} basic weaves used in Byzantium and the Islamic weaving {{centers of the}} Mediterranean – tabby, twill, damask, lampas and {{tapestry}} – the most important product was the weft-faced compound twill called samite. The word is derived from Old French samit, from medieval Latin samitum, examitum deriving from the Byzantine Greek [...] ἑξάμιτον hexamiton [...] "six threads", usually interpreted as indicating the use of six yarns in the warp. In samite, the main warp threads are hidden {{on both sides of}} the fabric by the <b>ground</b> and patterning <b>wefts,</b> with only the binding warps that hold the wefts in place visible.|$|R
