5|$|Six-year-old Maisie (Onata Aprile) {{lives in}} a New York {{apartment}} with her parents, Susanna (Julianne Moore), a singer in a rock band, and Beale (Steve Coogan), an international art dealer. Susanna and Beale argue with each other viciously and constantly, often ignoring Maisie and leaving her {{in the care of}} their nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham). Maisie does not always understand her parents' actions, such as when Susanna hires a locksmith to change the lock on the apartment's <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> keep Beale out. When they decide to separate, both parents are granted joint custody of Maisie.|$|E
25|$|The 1940 {{residence}} comprises six {{rooms with}} the former lounge and dining room to the east separated from four former bedrooms to the west by a central hall and lobby running from the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the kitchen at the rear. The lounge and dining room share a large double- sided fireplace of face-brick. Two of the former bedrooms retain built-in wardrobes, drawers and shelving. The walls throughout the house and onto the verandahs have a single lining of vertical v-jointed tongue and groove boards with ceilings lined in asbestos cement sheeting and finished with timber cover battens.|$|E
25|$|In April 1993, McVeigh {{headed for}} a farm in Michigan where Terry Nichols lived. In between {{watching}} coverage of the Waco siege on TV, Nichols and his brother began teaching McVeigh how to make explosives out of readily available materials; specifically, they combined household chemicals in plastic jugs. The destruction of the Waco compound enraged McVeigh and convinced {{him that it was}} time to take action. The government's use of CS gas on women and children angered McVeigh; he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects. The disappearance of certain evidence, such as the bullet-riddled steel-reinforced <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> the complex, led him to suspect a cover-up.|$|E

25|$|Information: Preparations {{for seeing}} {{in the new year}} were {{originally}} undertaken to greet the toshigami, or deity of the incoming year. These begin on December 13, when the house was given a thorough cleaning; the date is usually nearer {{the end of the month}} now. The house is then decorated in the traditional fashion: A sacred rope of straw (shimenawa) with dangling white paper strips (shide) is hung over the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> prevent evil spirits from entering and to show the presence of the toshigami. It is also customary to place kadomatsu, an arrangement of tree sprigs, beside the entrance way. A special altar, known as toshidana ("year shelf"), is piled high with kagamimochi (flat, round rice cakes), sake (rice wine), persimmons, and other foods in honor of the toshigami. A fair is traditionally held in late December at shrines, temples or in local neighborhoods. This is in preparation for the new year holidays. Decorations and sundry goods are sold at the fair. Originally these year-end fairs provided opportunities for farmers, fisherfolk and mountain dwellers to exchange goods and buy clothes and other necessities for the coming year.|$|E
500|$|A {{young woman}} {{attending}} {{a party at}} a neighbouring house on Canynge Road {{on the night of}} Yeates' disappearance recalled hearing two loud screams shortly after 9:00pm coming from the direction of Yeates' flat. Another neighbour who lived behind Yeates' home said that he heard a woman's voice scream [...] "Help me", although he could not recall exactly when the incident had occurred. Officers removed the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> Yeates' flat to check for clothing fibres and DNA evidence, with investigators examining the possibility that the perpetrator had entered the flat before Yeates returned home.|$|E

He discovers a butterfly in the sugar bowl, but when he finds the bees, he makes a big mess pulling out their nest. Mrs. Tittlemouse fears she [...] "shall go distracted" [...] {{as a result of}} the turmoil and takes refuge in the nut-cellar. When she finally ventures forth, she discovers everybody has left but her house is a mess. She takes some moss, beeswax, and twigs to partly close up her <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> keep Mr. Jackson out. Exhausted, she goes to bed wondering if her house will ever be tidy again.|$|E
500|$|By late 1977, Bundy's {{impending}} trial {{had become}} a cause célèbre {{in the small town}} of Aspen, and Bundy filed a motion for a change of venue to Denver. [...] On December 23 the Aspen trial judge granted the request—but to Colorado Springs, where juries had historically been hostile to murder suspects. On the night of December 30, with most of the jail staff on Christmas break and nonviolent prisoners on furlough with their families, Bundy piled books and files in his bed, covered them with a blanket to simulate his sleeping body, and climbed into the crawlspace. He broke through the ceiling into the apartment of the chief jailer—who was out for the evening with his wife—changed into street clothes from the jailer's closet, and walked out the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> freedom.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Lennon and Ono {{released}} an 81-minute film {{to accompany the}} Imagine album which featured footage of the couple in their home, garden and the recording studio of their Berkshire property at Tittenhurst Park {{as well as in}} New York City. A full-length documentary rock video, the film's first scene features a shot of Lennon and Ono walking through a thick fog, arriving at their house as the song [...] "Imagine" [...] begins. Above the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> their house is a sign that reads: [...] "This Is Not Here", the title of Ono's then New York art show. The next scene shows Lennon sitting at a white grand piano in a dimly lit, all-white room. Ono gradually walks around opening curtains that allow in light, making the room brighter with the song's progression. At the song's conclusion, Ono sits beside Lennon at the piano, and they share a quaint gaze, then a brief kiss.|$|E

[...] I'm on the phone every minute of every day, talking to people, being creative, planning this Ball, and my tour manager is constantly saying, 'Come on, we have to go, we've got to go right now,' [...] But to me, the Ball is so important.

500|$|Law {{enforcement}} officers {{believe that in}} 2009, Dugard's living quarters were in a secondary backyard behind Garrido's house. The private area of the yard included sheds (one of which was soundproofed and used as a recording studio in which Garrido recorded himself singing religious-themed and romantic country songs), two homemade tents, and what {{has been described as}} a camping-style shower and toilet. The area was surrounded by tall trees and a [...] high fence. An entrance to the secondary backyard was covered by trees and a tarpaulin. Privacy was enhanced by tents and outbuildings, and also housed a car that matched the description of the one used in the abduction. Electricity was supplied by extension cords. Law {{enforcement officers}} visited the residence at least twice, but did not ask to inspect the back yard, and did not detect the presence of Dugard or her children in the areas of the property that they did inspect. Witnesses interviewed stated Dugard was seen in the house, and sometimes answered the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> talk to people, but never stated there was a problem or attempted to leave. While the family kept to themselves, the girls were sometimes seen playing in the backyard or as passengers in Garrido's car.|$|E
500|$|Davis formed up {{his company}} and {{ordered them to}} march at about 7 a.m. According {{to his wife and}} other witnesses, shortly after {{stepping}} off, Davis ordered his company to halt, then returned to his <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> tell his wife, [...] "Take good care of the children." [...] Soon after crossing into Concord, the Acton company passed the farm of Colonel James Barrett who commanded the provincial troops in Concord that morning. A small detachment of British soldiers were searching Barrett's farm for supplies, and Davis considered attacking them. [...] His orders, however, were to muster {{with the rest of the}} provincial militia and Minutemen near the Old North Bridge by the Concord River. [...] He then diverted his company off the road, avoiding the British at Barrett's farm and marching past a tavern belonging to a Widow Brown. [...] A boy named Charles Handley, who lived at Widow Brown's Tavern, saw Davis's company pass the tavern. He recalled many years later that a fifer and drummer played a song called [...] "The White Cockade", a reference to the white ribbon worn on their bonnets by Scots revolutionaries during The '45. [...] Tradition persists that this was Davis's favorite marching song, but there is little evidence to support this notion. [...] There is also a tradition that the Acton musicians played the White Cockade later when Davis's company led the advance on the British at the Old North Bridge, although this too is not supported by primary source accounts.|$|E

500|$|The White House is {{also said}} to be visited by three specters who did not live there. The first is that of David Burns, who owned the ground on which the White House stands before selling it to the federal {{government}} in May 1791, and whose spirit has been seen in Oval Office. A reporter told a security guard during the Truman administration that, while standing in the Yellow Oval Room, he heard a faint ghostly voice which said, [...] "I'm Mr. Burns." [...] The second spirit is allegedly that of a British soldier dressed in a uniform from the War of 1812 and carrying a torch. In August 1814, a combined British land and sea force captured Washington, D.C., and set fire to the White House, Treasury Building, Capitol, and other buildings in retaliation for the American looting of York, Upper Canada (now the city of Toronto) and the burning of the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada after the Battle of York in 1813. The fires were put out only when a hurricane and tornado passed through Washington the following day, extinguishing the blazes. The soldier is claimed {{to be one of those}} who burned the White House, or who lost his life the following day in the storm. Another shade alleged to visit the White House is the ghost of Anna Surratt, daughter of convicted Lincoln assassination co-conspirator Mary Surratt, who forced her way into the White House the night before her mother's execution and unsuccessfully begged for her mother's life. It is claimed by some White House staff that Anna's ghost returns to the White House every July 6, silently banging on the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> seek entrance and continue her futile pleas for her mother's life.|$|E
500|$|In July 1916, Dillon was conscripted {{into the}} army, but disliked the {{discipline}} of regimental life. He applied for exemption on the grounds he had to look after his parents and four brothers, but his claim was rejected. In a later failed attempt, he tried to convince army officials {{that he was too}} obese to carry out military duties. [...] On the rare occasions when Dillon was allowed home on leave, he would often indulge in drinking sessions. [...] One night, Lloyd's friend Bella Burge received a knock at the <b>front</b> <b>door</b> <b>to</b> find a hysterical Lloyd covered in blood and bruises. [...] When asked to explain what had caused her injuries, she stated that she had caught Dillon in bed with another woman and had had a showdown with her husband. By 1917, Dillon's drinking had become worse. That June, two constables were called to Lloyd and Dillon's house in Golders Green after Dillon committed a drunken assault on his wife. [...] Police entered the house and found Lloyd and her maid cowering beneath a table. [...] Dillon confronted the constables and assaulted one of them, which resulted in him being taken to court, fined and sentenced to a month's hard labour. Lloyd began drinking to escape the trauma of her domestic abuse. [...] That year, she was earning £470 per week performing in music halls and making special appearances. By 1918, she had become popular with the British-based American soldiers, but had failed to capture the spirits of their English counterparts, and began feeling sidelined by her peers; Vesta Tilley had led a very successful recruitment drive into the services, and other music hall performers had been honoured by royalty. The following year, she performed perhaps her best known song, [...] "My Old Man (Said Follow the Van)", which was written for her by Fred W. Leigh and Charles Collins. [...] The song depicts a mother fleeing her home to avoid the rent man. [...] The lyrics reflected the hardships of working class life in London {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, and gave her the chance to costume the character in a worn out dress and black straw boater, while carrying a birdcage.|$|E

[...] At non fare control stops, an MBTA policy of forcing exiting passengers to also use the front doors (to prevent other riders from entering without paying) causes further congestion and delays.|$|E

The account credits Gastorius, believing himself {{to be on his}} death bed, with composing the hymn melody as music for his funeral. When Gastorius recovered, he instructed his choir in Jena to sing the hymn each week [...] "at his <b>front</b> <b>door</b> ... <b>to</b> make it better known." ...|$|E
