50|$|A {{coiled spring}} pin, {{also known as}} a spiral pin, is a self {{retaining}} <b>engineered</b> <b>fastener</b> manufactured by roll forming metal strip into a spiral cross section of 2 1/4 coils. Coiled spring pins have a body diameter larger than the recommended hole diameter and chamfers on both ends to facilitate starting the pin into the hole, the spring action of the pin allows it to compress as it assumes the diameter of the hole.|$|E

50|$|The Airframe Products segment {{includes}} PCC Fasteners and PCC Aerostructures. It is {{the leading}} developer and manufacturer of highly <b>engineered</b> <b>fasteners,</b> fastener systems, aerostructures and precision components primary used in critical aerospace applications. In addition to the aerospace and gas turbine markets, this segment serves the construction, automotive, heavy truck and general industrial markets.|$|R
50|$|Illinois Tool Works Inc. or ITW is a Fortune 500 {{company that}} {{produces}} <b>engineered</b> <b>fasteners</b> and components, equipment and consumable systems, and specialty products. It {{was founded in}} 1912 by Byron L. Smith.|$|R
50|$|The GM factory will be {{augmented}} by the a new fastener production facility called Parque Industrial Millennium, a 3400 m2 building, where EJOT of Bad Berleburg, Germany and ATF Inc. of Lincolnwood, IL, will manufacture <b>engineered</b> <b>fasteners</b> and cold-headed products.|$|R
50|$|Optimas OE Solutions, {{formerly}} Anixter OEM Supply â€” Fasteners, is {{a specialty}} distributor and manufacturer of highly <b>engineered</b> <b>fasteners</b> and C-Class components headquartered in Glenview, Illinois, United States. The company employs nearly 2,000 individuals globally, with 70+ locations, including 9 ISO-certified quality control labs, in Europe, Asia and North America. There are 30 {{locations in the}} United States.|$|R
5000|$|The Industrial Fasteners Institute (IFI) is a {{respected}} Independence, Ohio based trade and standards organization and publisher. Among their publications is the frequently cited [...] "IFI Fastener Technology Handbook", a reference available in hardcover and frequently {{used as a}} design guide by mechanical engineers, machinists, and others involved {{in the production of}} high-quality machine screws, bolts, nuts and other <b>engineered</b> <b>fasteners.</b>|$|R
40|$|The Australian anchor {{industry}} is rapidly growing, however, guidance {{for the design}} of post-installed and cast-in anchors for safety-critical applications in Australian codes of practice is minimal. The current level of guidance has resulted in a lack of consistency for product assessment and limited guidance for design. This paper summarises a design procedure for cast-in and post-installed anchors that has been endorsed by the Australian <b>Engineered</b> <b>Fasteners</b> and Anchors Council (AEFAC) for adoption in Australia. The design procedure is based on design guidelines that are intended to become a harmonised European Standard. The design guidelines are an imperative part of a framework being developed by AEFAC to enhance quality and safety standards in the Australian fastener industry...|$|R
50|$|Captive <b>fasteners</b> are an <b>engineered</b> {{class of}} <b>fastener</b> {{designed}} for a permanent hold (captivation) within a target assembly or housing, including upon servicing. They provide a secure joining, and avoid fastener loss or damage that might {{be caused by a}} loose part.|$|R
50|$|Each hole {{contains}} a specially formed t-nut to allow modular climbing holds to be screwed onto the wall. With manufactured steel or aluminum walls, an <b>engineered</b> industrial <b>fastener</b> {{is used to}} secure climbing holds. The face of the multiplex board climbing surface is covered with textured products including concrete and paint or polyurethane loaded with sand. In addition to the textured surface and hand holds, the wall may contain surface structures such as indentions (incuts) and protrusions (bulges), or {{take the form of}} an overhang, underhang or crack.|$|R
2500|$|Tools and {{fasteners}} with sizes {{measured in}} inches are sometimes called [...] "SAE bolts" [...] or [...] "SAE wrenches" [...] to differentiate {{them from their}} metric counterparts. [...] The Society of Automotive <b>Engineers</b> originally developed <b>fasteners</b> standards using U.S. units for the U.S. auto industry; the organization now uses metric units.|$|R
50|$|Design {{engineers}} {{apply the}} Junker Test {{to determine the}} point at which fastener securing elements - such as lock nuts, wedges and lock washers - fail when subjected to vibration. The data collected by the test enables design <b>engineers</b> to specify <b>fasteners</b> that will perform under a wide range of conditions without loosening.|$|R
25|$|The nail's design {{began when}} its inventor, civil {{engineer}} Ed Sutt, {{traveled to the}} Caribbean {{in the wake of}} Hurricane Marilyn. Sutt's trip to the Caribbean was part of a team examining the wreckage of the 80% of the island's homes and business that had been destroyed in the hurricane's winds of 95mph (155km/h). The finding among the homes that had been destroyed was that wood failure was not the cause of destruction; instead, the findings showed that the nails holding the wood together had failed, leading to the buildings' ultimate collapse. Sutt's research began after taking a research assistantship program at the Clemson Wind Load Test Facility, which had received funding through a grant from FEMA. The grant was used to research wooden-framed structures and the relationship of their failure to wind velocity. The outcome of the project's research showed {{that the best way to}} strengthen a structure was to improve the fasteners that held the roofing and wall sheathing to the internal frame, and with this information Sutt signed on as a <b>fastener</b> <b>engineer</b> for the Stanley subsidiary, Bostitch.|$|R
