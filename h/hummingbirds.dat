50|$|Similar {{species to}} the black-chinned <b>hummingbird</b> include broad-tailed <b>hummingbird,</b> rufous <b>hummingbird,</b> calliope <b>hummingbird,</b> Allen's <b>hummingbird,</b> lucifer <b>hummingbird,</b> Anna's <b>hummingbird,</b> and Costa's <b>hummingbird.</b>|$|R
50|$|The admirable <b>hummingbird</b> or Talamanca <b>hummingbird</b> (Eugenes spectabilis) {{is a large}} <b>hummingbird.</b> Some taxonomic authorities, such as the International Ornithological Committee, {{split the}} {{magnificent}} <b>hummingbird</b> into two species, {{in which case the}} nominate fulgens is renamd Rivoli's <b>hummingbird,</b> and spectabilis is named the admirable <b>hummingbird.</b> Other taxonomic authorities have not recognized the split. The admirable <b>hummingbird's</b> range is Costa Rica to Panama.|$|R
50|$|In 2012 the Society {{held its}} first Sedona <b>Hummingbird</b> Festival in Sedona, Arizona. This event {{consisted}} of three days of presentations by <b>hummingbird</b> experts, <b>hummingbird</b> banding demonstrations, <b>hummingbird</b> garden tours, a gala banquet, and a <b>hummingbird</b> marketplace.|$|R
5|$|Nectar- and pollen-eating bats {{are able}} to hover, {{in a similar way}} to <b>hummingbirds.</b> The sharp leading edges of the wings can create vortexes which provide lift. The vortex may be {{stabilized}} by the animal changing its wing curvatures.|$|E
5|$|Living {{things like}} orchids, <b>hummingbirds,</b> and the peacock's tail have {{abstract}} designs with a beauty of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match. The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, {{notably in the}} mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the smaller}} insectivorous birds {{including}} the warblers, <b>hummingbirds</b> and flycatchers migrate large distances, usually at night. They land {{in the morning and}} may feed for a few days before resuming their migration. The birds are referred to as passage migrants in the regions where they occur for short durations between the origin and destination.|$|E

50|$|The amazilia <b>hummingbird</b> (Amazilia amazilia) is {{a species}} of <b>hummingbird,</b> a family of small near {{passerine}} birds. The Loja <b>hummingbird</b> (A. alticola), with less rufous to the underparts, is sometimes considered a subspecies of the amazilia <b>hummingbird.</b>|$|R
5|$|Now {{under the}} {{management}} of the Asa Wright Nature Center, the William Beebe Tropical Research Station has gradually been renovated. It is now once again actively involved in research and an important gathering place for scientists. It is also a popular destination for birdwatchers, who can observe the same populations of <b>hummingbirds,</b> tanagers and oilbirds that William Beebe studied decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|The {{wide range}} of {{habitats}} in the park supports a diverse population of birds including some, such as the vermilion flycatcher and the whiskered screech owl, uncommon elsewhere in the United States. Among the park's 107 bird species are great horned owls, cactus wrens, ravens, kestrels, turkey vultures, roadrunners, woodpeckers, hawks, quails, and <b>hummingbirds,</b> and one threatened species, the Mexican spotted owl.|$|E
5|$|Wildlife {{is common}} in the area's ecosystem. Marmots tend to live in large social groups, and {{play a role in}} {{regulating}} the alpine vegetation. Eagles, hawks, coyotes, and badgers are common predatory animals. Clark's nutcrackers and gray jays are also common, and various species of grouse are present. Insects and <b>hummingbirds</b> are common pollinators.|$|E
50|$|The bee <b>hummingbird,</b> zunzuncito or Helena <b>hummingbird</b> (Mellisuga helenae) is {{a species}} of <b>hummingbird</b> which is the world's {{smallest}} bird.|$|R
50|$|The sapphire-throated <b>hummingbird</b> {{is often}} mistaken {{for the other}} members of its genus which {{includes}} the sapphire-bellied <b>hummingbird</b> (Lepidopyga lilliae) and the shining-green <b>hummingbird</b> (Lepidopyga goudoti). Unlike the sapphire-throated <b>hummingbird,</b> the male sapphire-bellied <b>hummingbird</b> has a darker shiny blue coloration on its throat which covers its entire ventral-side {{with the exception of the}} white undertail. The shining-green <b>hummingbird</b> differs in that it has very little to no blue plumage in comparison to the other two Lepidopyga species.|$|R
5000|$|A hybrid {{between this}} species and Anna's <b>hummingbird</b> was called [...] "Trochilus" [...] violajugulum. The black-chinned <b>hummingbird</b> {{is also known}} to {{hybridize}} with Costa's <b>hummingbird.</b>|$|R
5|$|A {{patch of}} {{coloured}} feathers {{found on the}} throat or upper breast of some species of birds. It is a feature found on many male <b>hummingbirds,</b> particularly those found in North America, whose gorgets are typically iridescent. Other species have gorgets, such as the purple-throated fruitcrow and the chukar partridge. The term {{is derived from the}} gorget used in military armor to protect the throat.|$|E
5|$|Among Chacoan mammals are the {{plentiful}} coyote (Canis latrans); mule deer, elk, and pronghorn also {{live within}} the canyon, though they are rarely encountered by visitors. Important smaller carnivores include bobcats, badgers, foxes, and two species of skunk. The park hosts abundant populations of rodents, including several prairie dog towns. Small colonies of bats are present during the summer. The local shortage of water means that relatively few bird species are present; these include roadrunners, large hawks (such as Cooper's hawks and American kestrels), owls, vultures, and ravens, though they are less abundant in the canyon than in the wetter mountain ranges to the east. Sizeable populations of smaller birds, including warblers, sparrows, and house finches, are also common. Three species of <b>hummingbirds</b> are present: one is the tiny but highly pugnacious rufous hummingbird, which compete intensely with the more mild-tempered black-chinned <b>hummingbirds</b> for breeding habitat in shrubs or trees located near water. Western (prairie) rattlesnakes are occasionally seen in the backcountry, though various lizards and skinks are far more abundant.|$|E
5|$|E. eastwoodiae, E. nelsonii, E. rupestris, and E. verbenacea {{are also}} pollinated by <b>hummingbirds.</b> These four species {{as well as}} E. cardinalis and E. nelsonii produce {{bisexual}} flowers and are self-compatible. This approximate ratio of insect vs hummingbird pollination holds true {{for the rest of}} the genus. There have been two separate transformations to hummingbird pollination. Pollination changes are highly affected by changes in flower morphology. E. cardinalis and its sister species E. cinnabarina likely evolved via allopatric speciation.|$|E
50|$|Doubleday's <b>hummingbird</b> (Cynanthus doubledayi) is {{a species}} of <b>hummingbird</b> in the Trochilidae family {{also known as the}} turquoise-crowned <b>hummingbird.</b> Some taxonomic authorities, such as the American Ornithological Society {{consider}} this bird to be a subspecies of the broad-billed <b>hummingbird,</b> while others consider it distinct.|$|R
5000|$|The ruby-throated <b>hummingbird</b> (Archilochus colubris) {{is a small}} <b>hummingbird.</b> It is {{the only}} species of <b>hummingbird</b> that {{regularly}} nests east of the Mississippi River in North America.|$|R
50|$|The snowy-bellied <b>hummingbird</b> (Amazilia edward), {{sometimes}} {{placed in}} the genus Saucerottia, is a species of <b>hummingbird</b> in the Trochilidae family. It is sometimes known by the name snowy-breasted <b>hummingbird.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Hummingbirds</b> are {{significant}} pollinators of cacti. Species showing the typical hummingbird-pollination syndrome have flowers with colors towards the red {{end of the}} spectrum, anthers and stamens that protrude from the flower, and a shape that is not radially symmetrical, with a lower lip that bends downwards; they produce large amounts of nectar with a relatively low sugar content. Schlumbergera species, such as S. truncata, have flowers that correspond closely to this syndrome. Other hummingbird-pollinated genera include Cleistocactus and Disocactus.|$|E
5|$|North American birds {{most closely}} {{resemble}} those of Eurasia, which {{was connected to the}} continent as part of the supercontinent Laurasia until around 60 million years ago. Many groups occur throughout the Northern Hemisphere and worldwide. However some groups unique to the New World have also arisen; those represented in this list are the <b>hummingbirds,</b> the New World vultures, the New World quail, the tyrant flycatchers, the vireos, the mimids, the New World warblers, the tanagers, the cardinals and the icterids.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have shown}} how {{important}} birds are to individual societies, touching on {{all aspects of}} life. In Andean societies such as the Moche (1–800 AD), Nazca (100–700 AD) and Chimu (1150–1450 AD), bright parrot and macaw feathers were traded from the Amazon rainforest to {{the mountains and the}} Pacific coast, while guano was collected as a fertiliser, and artists and craftsmen were inspired to create textiles, metal jewellery, and ceramics depicting condors, cormorants, ducks, <b>hummingbirds,</b> owls, vultures, and waders. Their religions, too, endowed birds with symbolic meaning.|$|E

5|$|The Lights {{were banned}} from photographing all of Central America except Guatemala, Ecuador, and Colombia, {{as a safety}} measure against the {{gathering}} of strategic knowledge. They {{took advantage of the}} Peruvian government's allowal to take pictures in the air by capturing the earliest photographs of the Nazca lines. These were unable to distinguish from the surface, though further into the atmosphere the designs can range from simple patterns to <b>hummingbirds</b> and llamas.|$|E
5|$|Birds are {{the animals}} most {{often seen in}} the monument. Included {{among the more than}} 50 species {{observed}} are red-tailed hawks, American kestrels, great horned owls, common nighthawks, and great blue herons. Geese nest in the park each summer, and flocks of sandhill cranes and swans pass overhead each year on their migratory flights. California quail, chukar partridges, and mourning doves are also common. Others seen near the Cant Ranch and the visitor's center include rufous <b>hummingbirds,</b> Say's phoebe, yellow warblers, western meadowlarks, and American goldfinches. Visitors on trails may encounter canyon wrens, mountain bluebirds, mountain chickadees, black-billed magpies, and other birds.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{respective}} breeding seasons, {{several species of}} <b>hummingbirds</b> occur at the same locations in North America, and several hummingbird flowers bloom simultaneously in these habitats. These flowers have converged to a common morphology and color because these are effective at attracting the birds. Different lengths and curvatures of the corolla tubes can affect the efficiency of extraction in hummingbird species in relation to differences in bill morphology. Tubular flowers force a bird to orient its bill {{in a particular way}} when probing the flower, especially when the bill and corolla are both curved. This allows the plant to place pollen on a certain part of the bird's body, permitting a variety of morphological co-adaptations.|$|E
50|$|The Pirre <b>hummingbird</b> (Goethalsia bella), also {{somewhat}} misleadingly {{known as}} the rufous-cheeked <b>hummingbird,</b> is a species of <b>hummingbird</b> in the family Trochilidae. It is the only species in its genus.|$|R
5000|$|Rivoli's <b>hummingbird</b> (Eugenes fulgens) {{is a large}} <b>hummingbird.</b> It {{was usually}} {{considered}} {{the only member of}} the genus Eugenes, and called magnificent <b>hummingbird.</b> Many taxonomic authorities, such as the International Ornithological Committee, split the northern, nominate subspecies E. f. fulgens from the larger, southern race of Costa Rica and Panama, E. f. spectabilis as distinct species, in which case the nominate fulgens is renamd Rivoli's <b>hummingbird,</b> and spectabilis is named the admirable <b>hummingbird.</b>|$|R
