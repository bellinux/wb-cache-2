In [23], we presented a uniform declarative and operational framework, based on annotated logics, for amalgamating multiple <b>knowledge</b> <b>bases</b> and data structures (e. g. relational, object-oriented, spatial, and temporal structures) when these <b>knowledge</b> <b>bases</b> (possibly) contain inconsistencies, uncertainties, and non-monotonic modes of negation.
