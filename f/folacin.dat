Substantially higher amounts of <b>folacin</b> were found in teas than that reported previously in the literature. Green tea leaves possessed the highest total folic acid (TFA) content, ranging from 9. 48 mcg/g to 12. 75 mcg/g and with an average of 11. 20 mcg/g. Black tea leaves had highest free folic acid (FFA) content, ranging from 1. 36 mcg/g to 2. 07 mcg/g with an average of 1. 74 mcg/g. Oolong tea leaves had a low <b>folacin</b> content when compared to green and black tea leaves with an average of 0. 38 mcg/g in FFA content and 3. 53 mcg/g of TFA. Herb tea did not show much <b>folacin</b> activity. The reason for this decrease of activity is due to the insignificant amount of <b>folacin</b> in the major raw materials used to manufacture herb teas. Different brands of instant tea contained various amounts of <b>folacin.</b> In one gram of instant tea powder, pure instant teas (100 %) had the highest <b>folacin</b> content while instant tea mix (sugar and lemon flavored) showed the lowest <b>folacin</b> activity. When comparing with hot water prepared instant teas, the cold water prepared instant teas had higher FFA content and lower TFA content. This may suggest that the FFA of instant tea is more labile to heat than TFA while TFA has higher solubility in hot water than in cold water. The amount of <b>folacin</b> extracted from tea leaves into tea brews during 5 minutes hot water infusion differs among <b>folacin</b> types and tea types. The average percentage of <b>folacin</b> extracted from tea leaves were 62 % of both FFA and TFA from green tea, 51 % FFA and 70 % TFA from black tea, and 38 % FFA and 62 % TFA from oolong tea. The tea bag itself was found to have inhibitory effects on the extraction of <b>folacin</b> from tea leaves into tea infusions.

It was found that fresh mulukhiyah contained 556 mcg free folic acid (FFA) and 800 mcg total folic acid (TFA) per 100 g fresh weight basis, and room dried mulukhiyah contained 662 mcg FFA, and 1138 mcg TFA per 100 g dry weight. Therefore, mulukhiyah is an excellent source of folate in the Egyptian diet. The destruction of folic acid in mulukhiyah was high in all three drying methods studied. The retention of FFA ranged from 34 to 42 percent, and TFA ranged from 42 to 48 percent. Retention of TFA was always higher than that of FFA during drying because of 70 percent of the TFA in mulukhiyah is FFA, which is more sensitive to heat than total <b>folacin.</b> Freeze drying method resulted in high <b>folacin</b> retention than the other drying methods. Approximately 10 percent more TFA was preserved by the freeze drying method than that retained by the room drying method while the differences in <b>folacin</b> retention between the tray drying and the room drying methods was 7 percent. The retention of <b>folacin</b> in room dried mulukhiyah during storage varied depending on the packaging method. There was a significant difference (P< 0. 01) in <b>folacin</b> retention between mulukhiyah packed in colored or clear jars under nitrogen or air atmosphere, and length of storage time. There was a significant decrease in folic acid retention with storage time of 48 weeks under all the conditions.

Information regarding the prevalence of known risk factors for cervical dysplasia, early age at first intercourse, multiple sexual partners, early age at first pregnancy, history of having sexually transmitted diseases, cigarette smoking, and sociodemographic data was collected. Dietary intake was estimated using a 97 item quantified food frequency questionnaire designed to obtain information on consumption of all sources of retinol, carotenoids, vitamin C and <b>folacin.</b> Univariate analyses showed that the presence of cervical dysplasia was positively and significantly associated with all the risk factors. In analyses of the association of the dietary variables with cervical dysplasia, information on carotenoid intake was calculated in two ways, as total carotenoid intake and as intake of lycopene and other carotenoids. While there appeared to be an inverse association between the presence of cervical dysplasia and intakes of lycopene and <b>folacin,</b> lower intake of retinol, total carotenoids, other carotenoids (non-lycopene carotenoids) or vitamin C did not increase the risk of having cervical dysplasia.

The effects of time and temperature, type of energy used, and the presence of oxygen and reducing agent during heating of various monoglutamate folate forms were investigated. <b>Folacin</b> derivatives used for experimentation included pteroylglutamate (PteGlu), 5 -formyltetrahydropteroylglutamate (5 -HCO-H 4 PteGlu), 5 methyl-tetrahydropteroylglutamate (5 -cH 3 -H 4 PteGlu), and tetrahydropteroylglutamate (H 4 PteGlu). Aqueous and buffered <b>folacin</b> solutions were maintained at different temperatures, ranging from 50 -l 00 ??C with. Conventional thermal heat and 0 - 100 ??C with microwave energy. Separate experiments were conducted where samples were de-aerated by bubbling nitrogen gas through the solutions during heating. Some of these experiments were repeated with the addition of ascorbic acid to the folate solutions. Samples were withdrawn at various time intervals and <b>folacin</b> content determined by microbiological assay, using Lactobacillus casei (ATCC 7469).

The {{effects of}} conjugase source, oonjugase preparation methods, and conjugase treatment procedures on the <b>folacin</b> activity (as measured by Lactobacillus casei) in spinach were studied. Treatment of spinach extract under favorable conditions with three different sources of conjugase [...] fresh hog kidney, fresh chicken pancreas, or Difao dried chicken pancreas [...] {{did not result in}} significantly different <b>folacin</b> activities in spinach. Additional studies were conducted on the preparation and use of Difco dried chicken pancreas. Dispersing dried pancreas in water (3 mg/ml) produced an effective aonjugase solution that was stable throughout 44 weeks of continuous frozen storage. Purification of conjugase solution with Dowex resin reduced the contaminating folate to less than 1. 5 ng/ml. Buffer species had a marked effect on Difco chicken pancreas conjuga. se activity. Highest activity was observed in tris and potassium phosphate-NaOH buffers. Citrate iphosphate bt. Iffer inhibited conjugase activity. The pH optimum was buffer dependent. Peak activity occurred at pH 4. 7 in sodium acetate buffer; 6. 0 in sodium phosphate, potassium phosphate, and potassium phosphate-NaOH buffers; and 8. 5 in tris buffer. Using an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1 A or 0. 25 : 1, a hour incubation period with the conjugase was adequate for !the deoonjugation of spinach polyglutamates. A prolonged incubation time of 18 hours resulted in significantly lower 1 TFA in spinach. Conjugase treatment prior to filtration of cellular debris from the sample resulted in significantly decreased TFA in spinach. Furthermore, filtering through filter paper, as opposed to centrifuging, yielded significantly decreased TFA values, but did not affect FFA values.
