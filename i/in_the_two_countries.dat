5|$|Instead of {{operating}} as {{an association of}} independently owned teams, MLS is a single entity in which each team is owned and controlled by the league's investors. The investor-operators control their teams as owners control teams in other leagues, and are commonly (but inaccurately) {{referred to as the}} team's owners. The league has a fixed membership, like most sports leagues in the United States and Canada, which makes it one of the world's few soccer leagues that does not use promotion and relegation, a practice that is uncommon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> MLS headquarters is located in New York City.|$|E

5|$|New Jersey {{spent the}} next several years in the peacetime routine of the Atlantic Fleet, with various {{training}} maneuvers and gunnery practice in the Atlantic and Caribbean. During this period, she spent a year out of commission at Boston from 2 May 1910 to 15 July 1911, and in the summers of 1912 and 1913, she conducted training cruises for midshipmen from the United States Naval Academy. The ship was deployed to the Caribbean to protect American interests as the Mexican Revolution worsened in late 1913. On 21 April 1914, the United States occupied Veracruz {{in the aftermath of the}} Tampico Affair. On 13 August, New Jersey departed Mexican waters and steamed to Santo Domingo, where unrest gripped both the Dominican Republic and Haiti. After observing conditions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries,</b> the ship continued on, arriving in Hampton Roads on 9 October.

25|$|During the {{depression}} of 1873–96, most European countries experienced a drastic fall in prices. Still, many corporations {{were able to}} reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates, and, as a result, industrial production increased by 40% in Britain and by over 100% in Germany. A comparison of capital formation rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> helps {{to account for the}} different industrial growth rates. During {{the depression}} the British ratio of net national capital formation to net national product fell from 11.5% to 6.0% while Germany's rose from 10.6% to 15.9%. In essence, {{during the course of the}} depression, Britain took the course of static supply adjustment while Germany stimulated effective demand and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting capital formation. For example, Germany dramatically increased investment with regard to social overhead capital, such as in the management of electric power transmission lines, roads, and railroads, while this input stagnated or decreased in Britain and the investment helped to stimulate industrial demand in Germany. The resulting difference in capital formation accounts for the divergent levels of industrial production <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> and the different growth rates during and after the depression.|$|E

25|$|Federal {{spending}} in constant dollars increased under Bush by 26% {{in his first}} {{four and a half}} years. Non-defense {{spending in}}creased 18% in that time. Of the US$2.4 trillion budgeted for 2005, about US$450 billion are planned to be spent on defense. This level is generally comparable to the defense spending during the cold war. Congress approved US$87 billion for Iraq and Afghanistan in November, and had approved an earlier US$79 billion package last spring.

25|$|These {{incidents}} prompted greater {{cooperation between}} {{law enforcement agencies}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries,</b> building on a 1999 agreement on drug trafficking and money laundering. The Australian Federal Police's Jakarta Regional Cooperation Team provided assistance to the Indonesian National Police, and {{has contributed to the}} Jakarta Centre for Law Enforcement Cooperation. This relationship has attracted criticism, particularly following the arrest and sentencing of the Bali Nine, a group of nine Australians arrested in Denpasar while attempting to smuggle heroin from Indonesia to Australia. The 2005 conviction of Schapelle Corby for attempting to smuggle drugs to Bali also attracted significant attention in the Australian media.|$|E
25|$|An {{assessment}} by Health Canada {{found that}} cancer mortality rates are almost identical <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> Another international comparison by the National Cancer Institute of Canada indicated that incidence rates for most, but not all, cancers were {{higher in the}} U.S. than in Canada during the period studied (1993–1997). Incidence rates for certain types, such as colorectal and stomach cancer, were actually higher in Canada than in the U.S. In 2004, researchers published a study comparing health outcomes in the Anglo countries. Their analysis indicates that Canada has greater survival rates for both colorectal cancer and childhood leukemia, while the United States has greater survival rates for Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as breast and cervical cancer.|$|E

25|$|Much more is {{now known}} about early Cuban jazz bands, but a full {{assessment}} is plagued {{by the lack of}} recordings. Migrations and visits to and from the US and the mutual exchange of recordings and sheet music kept musicians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> in touch. In {{the first part of the}} 20th century, there were close relations between musicians in Cuba and those in New Orleans. The orchestra leader in the famous Tropicana Club, Armando Romeu Jr, was a leading figure in the post-World War II development of Cuban jazz. The phenomenon of cubop and the jam sessions in Havana and New York organized by Cachao created genuine fusions that influence musicians today.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the Assigned PF in the United States and Britain were based on measurements {{of the effectiveness of}} respirators in the workplace (after statistical processing). Also used opinions of experts, based on the similarity of the respirators with different designs (for example, powered air purifying filtering respirators (PAPR), and a similar supplied air respirators SAR) - provided that the mode and the quantity of air supply, and the facepieces (masks) were the same. Experts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries</b> often used the results of the same studies of WPF (because of their limited number). For example, British standard had been developed with usage of results of 1897 WPF measurements during 31 studies; and 23 of this 31 studies had been conducted in United States.|$|E
25|$|Historical {{consensus}} {{notes that}} irrespective of whether military {{duty in the}} France was productive or not, the time spent by the Vietnamese soldiers in France had a profound transformation on them in both the social and individual sense. Inside as well as outside the barracks, the Vietnamese servicemen were often treated more equitably than in their home country. They encountered intellectual thought not openly promulgated in Vietnam. They could relate to Frenchmen, have relations with French women, and with other colonised peoples present in France. Furthermore, they could see that France too {{was in a state}} of change. As a result of their overseas service, at least some of the returning troops would attempt to rationalise the differences between their experiences <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>countries.</b> Coupled with the differences in colonial and metropolitan discipline, this is postulated to have bred a more critical stance towards their superiors and a more critical attitude towards the colonial order.|$|E
