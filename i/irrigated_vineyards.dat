During the five years of the experiment, the mixtures have ensured a higher level of soil covering compared to the other treatments. Moreover, the covering and the contribution to the dry matter yield for every component of the mixtures changed drastically with an increased presence of D. glomerata.

The relative evaporation (RE) method of Ben-Asher et al. (1983) was calibrated using microlysimeters and thermal imaging. Soil surface temperature in a drip <b>irrigated</b> <b>vineyard</b> was then collected using infrared temperature sensors mounted on a quad bike, on several days of the 2009 – 2010 season. Soil surface temperature in the vineyard ranged from 4. 6 °C to 65. 5 °C undervine and 6. 8 °C to 75. 6 °C in the middle of the row.

Four sites were actively investigated in this study. These are the Robertson experimental farm, Goedemoed farm near Robertson, Broodkraal farm near Piketberg and the Glenrosa farm near Paarl. Regular point measurements and soil samples were taken to study the behaviour of salinity in irrigated soils over several irrigation seasons. The quality of the irrigation water was adjusted to six different levels of salinity, between 30 mS m- 1 and 500 mS m- 1. At the Broodkraal and Glenrosa farms, large scale investigations were conducted to estimate salinity over larger areas. Broodkraal farm was a large newly established table grape enterprise offering the opportunity to study the initial change in soil salinity when irrigated with saline water. At the Glenrosa farm, there was an opportunity to characterize the soil even before <b>irrigated</b> <b>vineyards</b> were established. Suction cup measurements were taken with self-designed and patented lysimeters and used to follow the seasonal soil water salinity changes through the root zone under different salinity regimes.

A method was proposed to reduce the number of samples necessary to determine this salt depth trend and to estimate the quality of the soil water that drains below the rooting zone. One of the important findings was that an ECe threshold for vines of 100 mS m- 1 was more suitable than the conventional 150 mS m- 1 and that the sensitivity of the vines to levels beyond this threshold increased with the number of years of exposure.

40|$|Vineyard cover {{cropping}} is {{a cultural}} practice widely used {{in many of the}} world’s winegrowing regions being one of the most recommended practices to face climate changes and to promote vineyard environmental sustainability. The benefits of using cover crops are many ranging from environmental protection (e. g. control of soil erosion, enhancement of soil structure and biodiversity, sequestering carbon) to vineyard management, including control of vigor and improvement of berry composition. Despite those potential benefits, the adoption of cover crops in Mediterranean non-irrigated vineyards has been limited by the concern of excessive water competition between cover crops and vines. However the level of this competition should be better understood as in warm and dry terroirs, like the case of Mediterranean winegrowing regions, water competition by the cover crops is effective mainly during spring. During summer, the almost absence or rainfall induces the dry out of the sward vegetation which residues became dead mulch that can even reduce soil evaporation. Furthermore, some research has also demonstrated that, after some years of competition with swards, the vines were able to develop deeper roots, therefore increasing the capacity for water extraction from deeper soil layers. In order to further elucidate the above mentioned topics, in this paper data on water use and grapevine performance obtained in three floor management experiments (soil tillage vs. inter-row swards), carried out in three different winegrowing regions of the Mediterranean Portugal (covering rainfed and <b>irrigated</b> <b>vineyards),</b> will be presented. Discussion will be focus on water competition by the swards and corresponding effects on grapevine vigor, yield and berry composition. The effect of terroir on grapevine responses will be also underlined. From the data presented it can be concluded that cover crops is a vineyard management practice that can have a positive influence on water use efficiency, either by preventing vine excessive vigor when water is fully available during spring or by maximizing the volume of soil explored by vine roots through the enhancement of the exploitation of soil water reserves into deeper layers. However, in the case of low vigor vineyards located in dry terroirs, the degree of water competition between cover crops and vine must be carefully monitored and managed (e. g. by increasing mowing frequency, reducing the sward strip and/or choosing less competitive species) and adjustments in conventional irrigation management are necessary in order to avoid detrimental effects on grapevine yield and longevity. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E
40|$|Modern canopy {{management}} practices and irrigation strategies have improved {{the economic and}} environmental sustainability of Australia ' s wine industry, in terms of increased production and improved wine quality for minimal production cost and environmental impact. This study tested the hypothesis that partial rootzone drying (PRD) integrated with low input, minimal pruning practices can improve sustainability of winegrape production in warm - climate, <b>irrigated</b> <b>vineyards.</b> The bi - factorial experiment investigated three conventional pruning practices; hand spur pruning (SPUR), mechanical hedging (MECH) and minimal pruning (MIN) integrated with standard drip (SD) and PRD irrigation strategies. The sustainability of winegrape production of field - grown cv. Shiraz grapevines was determined by examining yield, fruit composition, wine composition and quality, vine physiology and susceptibility of bunches to Botrytis bunch rot. Winegrape production was strongly influenced by pruning level and the resultant bunch number per vine. Increased node retention at pruning of minimal pruned vines resulted in 4 - fold more bunches per vine than spur pruned vines. Mechanical hedged vines had an intermediate number of bunches per vine. Yield generally reflected the trend in bunch number per vine. However, minimally pruned and mechanically hedged vines compensated for greater carbohydrate partitioning between reproductive sinks by producing smaller bunches with fewer berries per bunch. Partial drying of the grapevine rootzone had a detrimental effect on yield relative to SD irrigation (18 %). The additive effect of SD combined with light pruning treatments resulted in few statistically significant interactions for the measured yield components. Berry weight was the only parameter influenced by the interaction between irrigation and pruning during the three experimental seasons; PRD + MIN reduced berry weight by 36 % compared to SD + SPUR, in response to lower irrigation inputs and higher bunch number. A 2 - fold increase in water use efficiency (tonnes per megalitre) was found by the reduced irrigation inputs of PRD combined with the high crop levels of MIN vines compared to SD + SPUR vines. Fruit and wine composition was also largely unaffected by combined irrigation and pruning treatments, {{as a result of}} the additive effect of PRD and MIN. However, light pruning levels (MIN and MECH) and their associated small berry size and high bunch exposure, reduced pH and increased titratable acidity, and anthocyanin and phenolic concentrations of berry juice compared to SPUR. Minor pruning level effects on wine composition can be directly correlated with those observed on fruit composition. PRD had minimal effect on basic fruit composition but strong effects on wine spectral parameters : density, hue, total anthocyanin and phenolic concentration and ionised anthocyanin concentration, possibly as a result of co - pigmentation of anthocyanin compounds with exocarp tannins. Berry size was strongly correlated with fruit and wine quality. Small berries (i. e. from PRD and MIN) had lower pH and higher anthocyanin and phenolic concentrations in the juice and produced wine that was more acidic, brighter and had higher colour density and anthocyanin (total and ionised) and phenolic concentrations than all other treatments. Midday and diurnal leaf gas exchange were manipulated by partially drying the rootzone. PRD reduced midday stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and transpiration compared to SD. Stomatal limitation on photosynthesis and transpiration was probable, given the strong positive relationship with stomatal conductance and reduced carbon isotope discrimination by PRD. Transpiration efficiency was improved for PRD irrigated vines compared to SD irrigated vines. Leaf water potential and osmotic potential were measured diurnally, in conjunction with leaf gas exchange to investigate the response of PRD irrigated vines to increasing vapour pressure deficit. Diurnally, stomatal conductance was reduced by PRD compared to SD, which maintained leaf water potential, while no osmotic adjustment occurred. Therefore, PRD irrigation maintained hydraulic water status by hydrating half of the rootzone, whilst dehydration of the other half of the rootzone resulted in the partial closure of stomata. Pruning treatment effects on vine physiology were less pronounced. Minor gas exchange effects showed that pruning level influenced carboxylation efficiency and not stomatal limitations, as photosynthesis was not directly correlated with stomatal conductance. Bunches were least resistant to infection by Botrytis when fully developed and at maximum maturity. The development of bunches into tighter clusters as berry size increased from veraison to harvest and the increase in sugar content may have encouraged development of Botrytis. The distinct bunch architecture resulting from the combined pruning and irrigation treatments influenced the incidence and severity of Botrytis bunch rot. Light pruning combined with PRD irrigation produced small, loose bunches in season 2001 - 02, which were less susceptible to Botrytis bunch rot development compared to the large, compact bunches produced on SD + SPUR vines. However, low bunch numbers and high fruit - set on MIN and MECH vines in season 2002 - 03 led to a significant change in bunch architecture. As a consequence of the increased compactness of bunches in season 2002 - 03, no pruning effects on Botrytis development were observed. Long term economic and environmental sustainability of winegrape production is dependent on continual improvement in fruit and wine quality, preservation of yield, reduced water and chemical usage. This study has shown partial drying of the rootzone combined with light pruning techniques improved yield, fruit and wine composition, water use efficiency and transpiration efficiency and reduced the incidence and severity of Botrytis bunch rot compared to SD and severe pruning levels. Therefore, over the three experimental seasons, PRD combined with minimal pruning was determined as the preferred strategy to enhance the sustainability of winegrape production of Shiraz cv. in warm - climate, <b>irrigated</b> <b>vineyards.</b> Thesis (Ph.

50|$|The Valle de Uco {{valley in}} the Southwest of Argentina offers a good climate, mineral-containing grounds and little precipitation. The heights of the Andes {{transform}} the humid west winds into dry and hot aerial currents, and ensure a continental semi-desert climate. Strong {{differences in the}} seasons with hot summers and cool winters provide high sugar content and healthy vines. Chilly summer nights allow the development of aromatic substances in the grapes. The sun shines more than 300 days annually. Small amounts of precipitation of 100 - 300 mm per year, require the <b>vineyards</b> to be <b>irrigated.</b> The <b>vineyard</b> operates a waterworks, fed with {{the water of the}} Andes rivers.|$|R

Although Petrolina, PE and Juazeiro, BA presented the biggest irrigated areas, the incrernents throughout the years (2002 - 2006) were smaller (213 and 171 %) than those for Santa Maria, PE (275 %) and for Lagoa Grande da Boa Vista, PE (260 %). 201...|$|R
40|$|This study {{compares the}} {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} solution and exchange complex of soil in a 3 -year-old <b>irrigated</b> <b>vineyard</b> (Vitis vinifera L., Red Globe cultivar) with that of adjacent clearing in the native hyperxerophyllic 'caatinga' vegetation. The soils are classified as Plinthic Eutrophic Red-Yellow Argisol; according to Soil Taxonomy they are isohyperthermic Plinthustalfs. Detailed physiographic characterization revealed an impermeable gravel and cobble covering the crystalline rocks; the relief of this layer was more undulating than the level surface. Significant higher concentrations of extractable Na, K, Mg and Ca were observed within the vineyard. Lower soil acidity, higher Ca/Mg ratios, as well as lower sodium adsorption and Na/K ratios reflected additions of dolomitic lime, superphosphate and K-bearing fertilizers. As {{the water of the}} São Francisco River is of good quality for irrigation (C 1 S 1), the increases in Na were primarily attributed to capillary rise from the saline groundwater table. None of the soil in the study area was found to be sodic. About 62 % of the vineyard had an Ap horizon with salinity levels above 1. 5 dSm- 1 (considered detrimental for grape production); according to average values for this horizon, a potential 13 % reduction in grape production was predicted. Differences in chemical composition in function of distance to the collector canals were observed in the clearing, but not in the vineyard. The influence of differences in the elevations of the surface and impermeable layers, as well as pediment thickness, was generally weaker under irrigation. Under irrigation, soil moisture was greater in points of convergent surface waterflow; the effect of surface curvature on chemical properties, though less consistent, was also stronger in the vineyard...|$|R
