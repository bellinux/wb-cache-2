500|$|In 1985, Voight blamed {{human error}} for the Armero tragedy in Colombia, {{where more than}} 23,000 died from an {{eruption}} from the Nevado del Ruiz volcano. He stated that while categorically accurate predictions of volcanic eruptions were impossible, unpreparedness for the disaster exacerbated the death toll. In January 1986, Voight visited Nevado del Ruiz responding to concerns from the Colombian government that the northeastern section of the volcano might cave in, causing another eruption. He established a monitoring network of reflectors and used laser ranging to track how the distances to these reflectors changed over time. When one reflector indicated significant movement, and large cracks became visible from the air, Voight contemplated initiating an evacuation, but waited. By March 1986, he realized the widening cracks were caused by the creep, or gradual shifting, {{of one of the}} volcano's glaciers, rather than rock movement. After leaving Colombia, Voight compiled the 14-page report [...] "Countdown to Catastrophe" [...] (1988), which analyzed how volcanic <b>hazard</b> <b>management</b> had failed at Armero.|$|E

When birds {{are involved in a}} strike, whether reported by an aircraft owner or operator, or the bird was found on the runway, feathers and/or DNA samples are recovered and sent to the Smithsonian Institution for positive identification.
