5|$|Admiral Scheer and Admiral Graf Spee {{had some}} {{improvements}} in armor thickness. The barbettes, 100mm thick in Deutschland, became 125mm {{for the two}} sisters. Admiral Scheer had the belt somewhat improved, and Admiral Graf Spee <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more improved 100mm belt, instead of 50–80mm.

Fischer's recent results and record Elo rating made him the pre-match favorite. Other observers, however, noted that Fischer had never won a game against Spassky.|$|E

5|$|Other {{tensions}} included Donen's hit films {{compared to}} Vincente Minnelli's Brigadoon (which Kelly was closely involved in and {{had wanted to}} direct) flop, and Kelly's own ambitious film Invitation to Dance, both financially unsuccessful. During the shooting of Seven Brides for Seven Brothers, Donen often complained about his budgetary constraints, while Brigadoon <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> larger budget. Around that time Kelly's unsuccessfully attempted dramatic acting with The Devil Makes Three and Seagulls Over Sorrento also flopped, and his marriage to Betsy Blair was ending.|$|E
5|$|Pairs may {{breed in}} {{isolation}} or in loose colonies, and will readily use nest boxes. In a Spanish study, boxes {{made from a}} mixture of wood and concrete (woodcrete) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> higher occupancy rate than wooden boxes (76.5% versus 33.5%), and birds nesting in woodcrete sites had earlier clutches, a shorter incubation period and more breeding attempts per season. Clutch size and chick condition did not differ between nest box types, but reproductive success was higher in woodcrete, perhaps because the synthetic nests were 1.5°C warmer than their wooden counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Silver {{was born}} on September 2, 1928, in Norwalk, Connecticut.

She was a maid and sang in a church choir; he worked for a tire company. Horace <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> older half-brother, Eugene Fletcher, from his mother's first marriage, and was the third child for his parents, after John, who lived to 6 months, and Maria, who was stillborn.|$|E

5|$|Although Callisto is {{very similar}} in bulk {{properties}} to Ganymede, it apparently <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> simpler geological history. The surface {{appears to have been}} shaped mainly by impacts and other exogenic forces. Unlike neighboring Ganymede with its grooved terrain, there is little evidence of tectonic activity. Explanations that have been proposed for the contrasts in internal heating and consequent differentiation and geologic activity between Callisto and Ganymede include differences in formation conditions, the greater tidal heating experienced by Ganymede, and the more numerous and energetic impacts that would have been suffered by Ganymede during the Late Heavy Bombardment. The relatively simple geological history of Callisto provides planetary scientists with a reference point for comparison with other more active and complex worlds.|$|E
5|$|Because the Dreamcast <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller user base than PlayStation platforms, Capcom {{knew the}} series {{could not survive}} on the platform. This led to {{bringing}} an extended cut, titled Code: Veronica X in the West and Code: Veronica Kanzenban in Japan, to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 in 2001. The extended cut was announced in November 2000. It has approximately 10 minutes of new cinematic sequences that reveal more about Wesker's involvement with Umbrella. The rest of the game remains mostly unchanged, although Capcom claimed they made some graphical enhancements. Capcom printed special DVDs of Wesker's Report for the North American PlayStation 2 release. They were sold on Capcom's website and given to customers who purchased the game at specialty retailers such as Electronics Boutique and GameStop.|$|E
5|$|Buffalo's {{offensive}} {{performance was}} {{in some ways the}} opposite of Connecticut's: while UConn dominated on the ground and barely passed the ball, Buffalo struggled with the run but had a good day passing. The Bulls ran for a total of 24yards on the game; James Starks accounted for 25yards on thirteencarries and scored a touchdown, while RB Brandon Termilus ran threetimes for fiveyards. Their total was partially offset by Drew Willy, who lost sixyards on three rushing attempts. Willy <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more successful day passing, completing 29 out of 43passes for 213yards and oneinterception. Namaan Roosevelt led the Buffalo receivers with 90yards on eightcatches; of the five other Bulls who received passes, WR Brett Hamlin caught fourpasses for 54yards, TE Jesse Rack caught three for 22yards, RB Starks caught 11 for 21yards, WR Ernest Jackson caught two for 17yards, and WR Gary Rice caught one for 9yards.|$|E

5|$|During 655, Æthelhere {{joined with}} Penda in {{an assault on}} Northumbria. Steven Plunkett asserts that Æthelhere's motive for {{changing}} sides was to deflect Penda's attention from East Anglia {{and the destruction of}} his kingdom that would have ensued. Penda invaded Northumbria with a force of thirty duces regii (or royal commanders) under his command that included a large contingent of Britons. He laid siege to Oswiu at Maes Gai, in the district of Loidis, which was probably at that time within the sphere of influence of the British kingdom of Rheged. Oswiu offered him a great ransom of treasure which, according to Bede, was refused (or according to the Historia Brittonum, was accepted and distributed)— in either case Penda resolved on battle and the destruction of the Northumbrians. Oswiu <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> smaller force, but in the event the Welsh armies of King Cadfæl of Gwynedd decamped on the eve of battle and Penda's ally Œthelwald of Deira stood aside to await the outcome.|$|E
5|$|East Germany's {{communities}} <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> harder time, {{because the}} country was poorer and their government imposed severe restrictions on them. The border region was progressively depopulated through the clearance of numerous villages and the forced relocation of their inhabitants. Border towns suffered draconian building restrictions: inhabitants were forbidden from building new houses and even repairing existing buildings, causing infrastructure to fall into severe decay. The state did little but to provide a 15% income supplement to those living in the Sperrzone and Schutzstreifen; but this did not halt the shrinkage of the border population, as younger people moved elsewhere to find employment and better living conditions.|$|E
5|$|Following Asilomar, new genetic {{engineering}} techniques and applications developed rapidly. DNA sequencing methods improved greatly (pioneered by Frederick Sanger and Walter Gilbert), as did oligonucleotide synthesis and transfection techniques. Researchers learned {{to control the}} expression of transgenes, and were soon racing—in both academic and industrial contexts—to create organisms capable of expressing human genes {{for the production of}} human hormones. However, this was a more daunting task than molecular biologists had expected; developments between 1977 and 1980 showed that, due to the phenomena of split genes and splicing, higher organisms <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>much</b> more complex system of gene expression than the bacteria models of earlier studies. The first such race, for synthesizing human insulin, was won by Genentech. This {{marked the beginning of the}} biotech boom (and with it, the era of gene patents), with an unprecedented level of overlap between biology, industry, and law.|$|E
