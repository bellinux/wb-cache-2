5|$|The {{financing}} <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> {{the downtown}} core came {{in large part}} from the infusion of investment from Dutch bankers; this investment was so deep that by 1896, one prominent Dutch mortgage company, the Northwestern and Pacific Hypotheekbank owned {{a quarter of the}} city.|$|E
5|$|After Hardorff's death, {{the main}} proponent of Classicism was Christian Frederik Hansen who {{developed}} a more severe style with clean, simple forms and large, unbroken surfaces. From 1800, {{he was in}} charge of all major building projects in Copenhagen where he designed the Copenhagen City Hall & Courthouse (1805–15) on Nytorv.

5|$|In October 2013, {{the federal}} Cabinet {{endorsed}} {{an agreement with}} the Turkish firm Al-Bayrak to manage the Port of Mogadishu for a 20-year period.

In September 2014, the federal government officially delegated management of the Mogadishu Port to Al-Bayrak. The firm's modernization project will cost $80 million.|$|E
5|$|Regent Street {{was one of}} {{the first}} planned {{developments}} of London. The desire to impose order on the city's medieval street pattern dates back to the aftermath of the Great Fire of London (1666) when Sir Christopher Wren and John Evelyn drew plans <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the city on the classical formal model, but progress was slow and houses were rebuilt on the old street network anyway.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets and an American {{group of}} architects each devised {{separate}} outlines <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> {{the town of}} Spitak. Following an invitation by the Soviets for a critique of their plan, the American's proposal was ultimately accepted as the way forward. The new plan would deviate from Soviet styles that {{were found to be}} rigid and outdated, and would mirror characteristics of the local culture. For many years following World War II the Soviets practiced a methodical top-down approach to urban planning and building, constructing a large number of uniformly built row style apartment units, and the Soviets plan <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> Spitak did not diverge from that approach. The Soviet's grid plan road scheme was found to {{not take into account the}} hillside at the new city's location, and the American's plan included finer details of how commercial centers and government facilities were grouped together in an open and communal style.|$|E

5|$|Tudur Hen {{has since}} the 18th century been {{historically}} {{credited with the}} construction of the Franciscan Llanfaes Friary near Bangor, but it has since been discovered that the building pre-dated him. However, since the friary sided with Edward in the two Welsh wars since the original construction, it has been proposed that Tudur was responsible <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the site around 1293 after it was damaged. He arranged to be interred in the south wall of the site.|$|E

5|$|Gatwick Airport was {{licensed}} as {{a private}} airfield in August 1930. It was used during the Second World War as an RAF base, and returned to civil use in 1946.

5|$|Hitler took a {{personal}} interest in architecture and worked closely with state architects Paul Troost and Albert Speer to create public buildings in a neoclassical style based on Roman architecture. Speer constructed imposing structures such as the Nazi party rally grounds in Nuremberg and a new Reich Chancellery building in Berlin. Hitler's plans <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> Berlin included a gigantic dome based on the Pantheon in Rome and a triumphal arch {{more than double the}} height of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. Neither structure was built.|$|E

5|$|Overall {{cost for}} {{reconstruction}} {{was estimated at}} $2.5billion, which was estimated to take four years. The cost for repairing the damaged houses was estimated at $484.8million. Following the storm, workers made emergency repairs to the destroyed bridges and roads. The cost <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> roads was higher than their damage cost due to planning for future flooding. Within a month, there were repairs to the power grid {{to a level of}} 550MW, or 91.7% of what it was before Mitch struck. Water companies restored water to 60% of Tegucigalpa within a month of the storm striking.|$|E

5|$|The castle was {{inherited}} by Edmund's sister's young son, Richard the Duke of York, {{who took}} possession in 1432. Richard took {{a keen interest}} in the castle, which formed the administrative base for his estates around the region, possibly living there in the late 1440s and definitely residing there for much of the 1450s. Richard also established his sons, including the future Edward IV, and their household at the castle in the 1450s, and was possibly responsible <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> {{the northern part of the}} Great Tower during this period.|$|E
5|$|The {{old wooden}} {{roof of the}} stand was due to be {{replaced}} {{the day after the}} Lincoln match, because it did not meet the safety regulations required for Division Two, where the team would be playing in the following season. Instead, it took until July 1986 <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> work to begin. The ground was used for reserve team fixtures from September 1985, but only journalists and club officials were present to watch. Bradford City's senior team played home games at other grounds in West Yorkshire for 19months while Valley Parade was rebuilt. The new ground cost £2.6million to rebuild, and was reopened in December 1986.|$|E
5|$|A coinage commemorating Edmund was minted {{from around}} the time East Anglia was absorbed by the kingdom of Wessex and a popular cult emerged. In about 986, Abbo of Fleury wrote {{of his life and}} martyrdom. The saint's remains were {{temporarily}} moved from Bury St Edmunds to London for safekeeping in 1010. His shrine at Bury was visited by many kings, including Canute, who was responsible <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> the abbey: the stone church was rebuilt again in 1095. During the Middle Ages, when Edmund was regarded as the patron saint of England, Bury and its magnificent abbey grew wealthy, but during the Dissolution of the Monasteries, his shrine was destroyed. Medieval manuscripts and works of art relating to Edmund include Abbo's Passio Sancti Eadmundi, John Lydgate's 14th-century Life, the Wilton Diptych and a number of church wall paintings.|$|E

5|$|Arsenal did {{not always}} play their home matches at Highbury in the 93 years they were based there. During the Second World War the stadium {{was used as an}} ARP station and was bombed; Arsenal played their matches at White Hart Lane, home of North London rivals Tottenham Hotspur, until Highbury re-opened in 1946. More recently, Arsenal's home UEFA Champions League matches in the 1998–99 and 1999–00 seasons were played at Wembley Stadium, as Highbury's already limited {{capacity}} had to be reduced to accommodate advertising hoardings. Arsenal's record at Wembley (P6 W2 D1 L3) was relatively poor, and after two seasons the club switched back to playing at Highbury, not least because since Wembley closed <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> in October 2000, {{it would not have been}} able to host their 2000–01 campaign.|$|E
5|$|By about a {{week after}} the passage of the hurricane, President George W.

The disaster declaration allocated the use of federal funds <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> and providing aid in the aftermath of hurricane Isabel. By about four months after the passage of the hurricane, disaster aid totaled about $516million (2003USD, $ USD), primarily in North Carolina and Virginia. Over 166,000 residents applied for individual assistance, with about $117million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for residents to assist with temporary housing and home repairs. About 50,000business owners applied for Small Business Administration loans, with about $178million (2003USD, $ USD) approved for the assistance loans. About 40,000people visited local disaster recovery centers, designed to provide additional information regarding the aftermath of the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|In 1805 or 1806 {{the last}} bull-baiting {{in the town}} took place. On 7 July 1839, a severe fire {{destroyed}} many houses in Cullompton.

A subscription <b>for</b> <b>rebuilding</b> was set and donations of £5 were made by Barne and Son, tanners of Tiverton, and Cullompton tanners Mortimore and Selwood. In 1847 a riot occurred in the town due to the high price of wheat. Three houses were attacked, including one in Pound Square belonging to Mr Selwood, the owner of a local tannery and also a maltster. He was accused of speculatively buying 2000 bushels of corn and when his house was attacked, almost all the windows were broken and his furniture was also damaged.|$|E
