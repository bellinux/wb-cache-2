5|$|Although {{he signed}} a new {{contract}} with Southport, Brodie signed for their National League rivals Aldershot Town on 14 August 2015 on a one-year contract. He debuted the following day as a 58th-minute substitute in a 3–0 away defeat to Wrexham, but started the following match, a 1–1 home draw with Dover Athletic, in which he scored Aldershot's equalising goal on 36 minutes from a Jim Stevenson pass. Having scored five goals from 26 appearances, Brodie left Aldershot by mutual consent on 29 January 2016, so he could move closer to home for family reasons.

5|$|Bradford City were {{struggling}} in the Second Division {{at the time}} of Cowan's signing, having won just one of their first ten games of the 1935–36 season. Cowan made his debut <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> 19 October 1935 in a 2–2 draw with Swindon Town, {{but it was not until}} Cowan's third game that Bradford won for the second time that season. Cowan missed just three of the club's remaining fixtures that season, playing 29 times in the league and three in the FA Cup as City finished 12th. The following season, City again struggled.

The family next moved to Belton, and in 1887 to his grandparents' 600-acre (240-ha) farm in Grandview. When Truman was six, his parents moved to Independence, so he could attend the Presbyterian Church Sunday School. Truman did not attend a traditional school until he was eight. While living in Independence, {{he served as a}} Shabbos goy for Jewish neighbors, doing tasks <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> Shabbat that their tradition prevented them doing on that day.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bombers}} worked over the airfield, Aircraftman D. Roberts waited <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>on</b> the {{northern}} boundary with his parachute-and-cable launchers. Three Do 17s were heading towards him, climbing slowly. When {{they were in}} range he fired the cables. Nine rockets flew upwards. Wilhelm Raab saw the rockets go up. Although {{he did not understand}} what they were, he banked the Do 17 to avoid the lines of smoke {{that may or may not}} have concealed something. Because the Dornier banked, one of the cables that hit his bomber slid off the wing before the lower parachute had time to deploy. Pilot Petersen's Dornier was not that lucky. Already on fire it ran into the cable which dragged it out of the sky. The Do 17 crashed killing all five crewmen. Oberleutnant Rudolf Lamberty (carrying Joachim Roth) also managed to avoid a collision, but before he could do so fire hit his Dornier destroying the fuel tanks. The bomber caught fire and he was barely able to keep control. Eventually it crash-landed at Leaves Green in Kent after being shot down by No. 111 Squadron Hurricanes. Roth was killed, but Lamberty survived with burns.|$|E
