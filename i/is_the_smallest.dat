5|$|The Eichstätt Specimen (JM 2257) was {{discovered}} in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany, and described by Peter Wellnhofer in 1974. Currently located at the Jura Museum in Eichstätt, Germany, it <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> known specimen and has the second best head. It is possibly a separate genus (Jurapteryx recurva) or species (A. recurva).|$|E
5|$|Type C <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> {{type and}} lives in larger groups than the others. Its eye patch is distinctively slanted forwards, rather than {{parallel}} to the body axis. Like type B, it is primarily white and medium gray, with a dark gray dorsal cape and yellow-tinged patches. Its only observed prey is the Antarctic cod.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> CL125A <b>was</b> {{produced}} from 1967 to 1969 with a 124 cc 4-stroke engine and four-speed transmission.

5|$|A {{lutetium}} atom has 71 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 4f145d16s2. When entering a chemical reaction, the atom loses its two outermost electrons {{and the single}} 5d-electron. The lutetium atom <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> among the lanthanide atoms, due to the lanthanide contraction, {{and as a result}} lutetium has the highest density, melting point, and hardness of the lanthanides.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> and second-closest {{member of}} the inner Jovian {{satellite}} family. It orbits Jupiter at a radius of about 129,000km (1.806Jupiter radii) at the exterior edge of the planet's Main Ring. Adrastea {{is one of only}} three moons in the Solar System known to orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day—the other two being Jupiter's innermost moon Metis, and Mars' moon Phobos. The orbit has very small eccentricity and inclination—around 0.0015 and 0.03°, respectively. Inclination is relative to the equator of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|As a {{district}}, Kuala Terengganu <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> {{in terms}} of area, but it (together with the district of Kuala Nerus that form the city area) has the largest population in Terengganu {{with a population of}} 406,317 in 2010.

50|$|Plato {{makes the}} point that <b>the</b> logistikon would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> part of <b>the</b> soul (as <b>the</b> rulers would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> {{population}} within <b>the</b> Republic), but that, nevertheless, a soul can be declared just only if all three parts agree that the logistikon should rule.|$|R
5|$|If {{the target}} value {{is greater than}} the {{greatest}} value in the array, and the last index of the array is the maximum representable value of L, the value of L will eventually become too large and overflow. A similar problem will occur if the target value is smaller than the least value in the array and the first index of the array <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>smallest</b> representable value of R. In particular, this means that R must not be an unsigned type if the array starts with index 0.|$|E
5|$|Kitti's hog-nosed bat <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{smallest}}</b> {{species of}} bat and arguably the world's smallest mammal. It has a reddish-brown or grey coat, with a distinctive pig-like snout. Colonies range greatly in size, {{with an average}} of 100 individuals per cave. The bat feeds during short activity periods in the evening and dawn, foraging around nearby forest areas for insects. Females give birth annually to a single offspring.|$|E

Members of the breed suffer {{from a wide variety of}} health ailments including problems with their hearts, eyes and ears.|$|E

It is classed as being of least concern by the IUCN, due to its wide distribution and presumed large population.|$|E
