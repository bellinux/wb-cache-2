40|$|The {{structure}} {{and development of}} a new state-of-the-art hybrid energy end-use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions model of the Canadian housing stock (CHS), with the capability of accurately determining the effects of renewable energy technologies, is presented. The model incorporates a 17, 000 house database developed using the latest data available from the EnerGuide for Houses database, Statistics Canada housing surveys, and other available housing databases. The geometry and thermal envelope of each house is defined in detail, making it suitable for energy simulation based on engineering methods (thermodynamics and heat transfer). The model utilizes the ESP-r building energy simulation program as its simulation engine. To account for effects due to occupant behaviour, a new neural network methodology is utilized to estimate the demographic dependencies of the annual energy consumption of discretionary end-uses such as appliances, lighting and domestic hot water. A new approach is used to allot the annual energy consumption of discretionary end-uses to hourly or sub-hourly intervals based on occupancy, appliance, lighting and domestic hot water load profiles. Each house’s profiles are incorporated into the model as loads, a portion of which becomes internal heat gain for inclusion in the space heating/cooling simulation conducted using ESP-r. A new method is used to calculate the GHG emissions from electricity consumption used in the residential sector based on the actual electrical generation fuel mix and the marginal fuel used in each province {{as a function of the}} time of year. The developing hybrid model will predict energy consumption and GHG emissions of the CHS based on the latest available stock databases and surveys and uses multiple simulation methods to account for <b>envelope</b> <b>losses</b> and occupant behaviour. When complete, the model may be used to assess the impacts of envelope upgrades or the addition of renewable energy technologies based on high resolution, targeted application...|$|E
40|$|Even {{though the}} loss of the outer, H-rich {{envelope}} may be a necessary condition for forming WR stars, it is clearly not a sufficient one. This is because the majority of planetary nuclei do not have a WR-type spectrum. The question why some central stars are WR stars while others are, say, O stars is addressed here. The question is approached by ascertaining how the properties of WR-type central stars differ from those of O-type stars. The study therefore begins with the classification and calibration of WR spectra. It is found that whereas the WR phenomenon may occur in stars of any mass, it is limited to stars that have been stripped (or mixed) down to their cores. The fact of prior <b>envelope</b> <b>loss,</b> however, is not sufficient to predict which stars will develop WR characteristics. Instead, a comprehensive description of <b>envelope</b> <b>loss,</b> including a detailed accounting of interior conditions and processes at the core envelope interface, will be required to explain the onset of WR characteristics...|$|R

We also propose a possible channel for the formation of single hot subdwarf stars, in which an old metal-rich RGB star with positive envelope binding energy may lose its envelope and the naked helium core gets ignited to become a hot subdwarf. We also review the well-established Han et al. scenario for the formation of hot subdwarf stars, in which binary interactions lead to the formation of both single and binary hot subdwarfs. By detailed binary evolution calculations, we show that PG 1018 - 047, a hot subdwarf binary with a main sequence companion and a very long orbital period of 756 [*] d, is explained naturally from the stable RLOF channel in the Han et al. scenario...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} core-collapse supernova distributions in isolated and interacting host galaxies, {{paying close attention to}} the selection effects involved in conducting host galaxy supernova studies. When taking into account all of the selection effects within our host galaxy sample, we draw the following conclusions: i) Within interacting, or 'disturbed', systems there is a real, and statistically significant, increase in the fraction of stripped-envelope supernovae in the central regions. A discussion into what may cause this increased fraction, compared to the more common type IIP supernovae, and type II supernovae without sub-classifications, is presented. Selection effects are shown not to drive this result, and so we propose that this study provides direct evidence for a high-mass weighted initial mass function within the central regions of disturbed galaxies. ii) Within 'undisturbed' spiral galaxies the radial distribution of type Ib and type Ic supernovae is statistically very different, with the latter showing a more centrally concentrated distribution. This could be driven by metallicity gradients in these undisturbed galaxies, or radial variations in other properties (binarity or stellar rotation) driving <b>envelope</b> <b>loss</b> in progenitor stars.

Calculating {{the effect of the}} active XUV saturation phase of G-type stars over the loss of the primitive nebula-captured hydrogen envelopes in extrasolar planets, it's obtained that planets with a core mass of more than 1.5 Earth-mass (1.15 Earth-radius max.), most likely cannot get rid of their nebula captured hydrogen envelopes during their whole lifetime. Other calculations point out that the limit between envelope-free rocky super-Earths and sub-Neptunes is around 1.75 Earth-radii, as 2 Earth-radii would be the upper limit to be rocky (a planet with 2 Earth-radii and 5 Earth-masses with a mean Earth-like core composition would imply that 1/200 of its mass would be in a H/He envelope, with an atmospheric pressure near to [...] ). [...] Whether or not the primitive nebula-captured H/He envelope of a super-Earth is entirely lost after formation also depends on the orbital distance.

In this paper we find, by modeling a red giant with a fully three-dimensional hydrodynamic code and a full nucleosynthetic network, that mixing arises in the supposedly stable and radiative zone between the hydrogen-burning shell and the base of the convective envelope. This mixing is due to Rayleigh-Taylor instability within a zone just above the hydrogen-burning shell. In this zone the burning of the 3 He left behind by the retreating convective envelope is predominantly by the reaction 3 He + 3 He → 4 He + 1 H + 1 H, a reaction which, untypically for stellar nuclear reactions, lowers the mean molecular weight, leading to a local minimum. This local minimum leads to Rayleigh-Taylor instability, and turbulent motion is generated which will continue ultimately up into the normal convective envelope. Consequently material from the envelope is dragged down sufficiently close to the burning shell that the 3 He in it is progressively destroyed.

The {{capacity of the}} suspensions to carry out CO 2 -dependent and ferricyanide-dependent O 2 evolution was measured under the same conditions of osmotic strength and detergent concentration. The chloroplasts in the preparations were {{in the form of}} cytoplasts and gave rates of O 2 evolution comparable with those expected from undamaged chloroplasts. Suspension in hypotonic solution depressed the rate of CO 2 -dependent O 2 evolution in both species, but this was partially restored in the Codium chloroplasts when these were re-suspended in iso-osmotic solutions. Major structural changes were observed only after suspension in buffer when the Codium chloroplasts lost their outer envelope, most of their stroma, and the thylakoids became swollen. Caulerpa chloroplasts were more variable in their response and, even when suspended in buffer only, the proportion of the plastids which had lost all of their stroma and thylakoid swelling was never as common as in Codium chloroplasts. However, once suspended in hyper-osmotic medium below 700 mosmolar, Caulerpa chloroplasts could not regain their capacity for CO 2 -dependent O 2 evolution. Detergent treatment removed the cytoplast membrane but not the cytoplasmic material adhering to the chloroplast envelope. High concentrations of detergent were needed to cause loss of the chloroplast <b>envelope,</b> <b>loss</b> of stromal contents and unstacking of the thylakoids. Caulerpa chloroplasts were less sensitive to detergent than those of Codium. There was no indication that specific structures such as the thylakoid organizing body were resistant to detergent action. The results show that exposure to hypotonic solutions and to detergent results in less damage to these chloroplasts than it would to those of higher plants. It is proposed that the basis of this unusual resistance is not due to the properties of the chloroplast membranes but to the presence of material which coats the organelles during isolation.

Using light and EM immunolocalization, we determined that mammalian Tpr is concentrated within the nuclear basket of the pore complex in a distribution similar to Nup 153 and Nup 98. Antibody localization together with imaging of GFP-Tpr in living cells revealed that Tpr is in discrete foci inside the nucleus similar to several other nucleoporins but is not present in intranuclear filamentous networks (Zimowska et al., 1997) or in long filaments extending from the pore complex (Cordes et al., 1997) as proposed. Injection of anti-Tpr antibodies into mitotic cells resulted in depletion of Tpr from the nuclear <b>envelope</b> without <b>loss</b> of other pore complex basket proteins. Whereas nuclear import mediated by a basic amino acid signal was unaffected, nuclear export mediated by a leucinerich signal was retarded significantly. Nuclear injection of anti-Tpr antibodies in interphase cells similarly yielded inhibition of protein export but not import. These results indicate that Tpr is a nucleoporin of the nuclear basket with a role in nuclear protein export...|$|R
40|$|Thermo graphic snap {{shooting}} of buildings {{as a method}} of detecting building <b>envelope</b> heat <b>losses</b> is a rather new method. By thermo graphic camera snapshots it is possible to detect elements of building envelope without thermal insulation or with a poor thermal insulation as well as crakes around windows or in the construction which cause high heat losses. Once, when the causes of thermal losses are detected, it is possible, through the process of reconstruction or refurbishment, to improve thermal characteristics of the buildings. Usually, thermal insulation is added on the facade, windows are changed with new once with better thermal performances and better air tightness, second or third glass pane is added, metal constructions with thermal bridges are removed [...] . Thermo graphic snapshots analyze also enables architects to avoid mistakes in designing new buildings. Several buildings in New Belgrade were photographed with thermal vision camera and the analyze of snapshots is presented In the paper. The chosen buildings, as representatives of specific construction method, were built in the period from 1950. to 1960., when according to the regulations, application of the thermal insulation was not obligatory. As more than 25 % of buildings in Belgrade were built in that period, those buildings represent a great potential for energy saving through the process of refurbishment...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe three-dimensional coupled mode sound propagation model of Chiu and Ehret (1990) is tested for its accuracy in modeling horizontal sound refraction. The test {{is achieved by}} comparing results generated by this model with exact analytic solutions to a parabolic approximation of the Helmholz Equation (Seigman, et al., 1990). Specifically, the acoustic wavefields associated with two cases of horizontally variable sound speed are considered. In Case I the sound speed varies only with azimuth, while in Case II there is radial and azimuth variation. The acoustic quantities used for the comparison included the modal modulation <b>envelopes</b> and transmission <b>loss.</b> Errors in the mode amplitude and phase are quantified and the significance of horizontal refraction is discussed.

40|$|Most air {{handling}} units (AHUs) in commercial buildings have an air economizer cycle for free cooling under certain outside air conditions. During the economizer cycle, the outside air and return air dampers are modulated to seek mixing air temperature at supply air temperature setpoint. Mechanical cooling is always required when outside air temperature {{is higher than the}} supply air temperature setpoint. Generally the supply air temperature setpoint is set at 55 ?F for space humidity control. Actually the dehumidification is not necessary when outside air dew point is less than 55 ?F. Meanwhile the space may have less cooling load due to <b>envelope</b> heat <b>loss</b> and/or occupant schedule. These provide an opportunity to use higher supply air temperature to reduce or eliminate mechanical cooling and terminal box reheat. On the other hand the higher supply air temperature will require higher air flow as well as higher fan power. Therefore the supply air temperature has to be optimized to minimize the combined energy for fan, cooling and heating energy. In this paper a simple energy consumption model is established for AHU systems during the economizer and then a optimal supply air temperature control is developed to minimize the total cost of the mechanical cooling and the fan motor power. This paper presents AHU system energy modeling, supply air temperature optimization, and simulated energy savings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This paper {{presents}} {{a case study}} of a sustainable certification of a building renovation. The new LEED® rating system, Historic BuildingTM protocol, proposed by Green Building Council Italy and addressed to Italian historical heritage, was applied to the High School “A. Canova” in Treviso, chosen because it was built before 1945 and it required a restoration work. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a retrofit design based on strategies according to three objectives: energy saving, preservation of historical architecture, improvement of indoor environmental quality for users. The application of Historic BuildingTM protocol has been carried out according to the protocol guidebook. The novelty of this paper is that Historic BuildingTM has been used as a design tool, not as assessment tool, in order to develop a design strategy. At first a building survey of the building has been performed to define the state of art in terms of structural instability and deterioration of surfaces and architectural elements in order to propose the most important renovation measures; the dynamic simulation was performed to calculate the building <b>envelope</b> thermal <b>losses</b> and the building energy demand for heating. Different energy efficiency measures have been proposed and an optimal solution has been defined according to simulation data and cost analysis evaluation. Three main goals have been achieved: the reduction of building energy consumptions up to 39...|$|R
40|$|Although current {{sensitivity}} limits {{are such that}} true solar system analogs remain challenging to detect, numerous planetary systems have been discovered that {{are very different from}} our own solar system. The majority of systems harbor a new class of planets, bodies that are typically several times more massive than the Earth but orbit their host stars well inside the orbit of Mercury. These planets frequently show evidence for large hydrogen and helium envelopes containing several percent of the planet's mass and display a large diversity in mean densities. Here we show that this wide range can be achieved by one or two late giant impacts, which are frequently needed to achieve long-term orbital stability in multiple planet systems once the gas disk has disappeared. We demonstrate using hydrodynamical simulations that a single collision between similarly sized exoplanets can easily reduce the envelope-to-core-mass ratio by a factor of two and show that this leads to a corresponding increase in the observed mean density by factors of two to three. In addition, we investigate how <b>envelope</b> mass <b>loss</b> depends on <b>envelope</b> mass, planet radius, semimajor axis, and the mass distribution inside the envelope. We propose that a small number of giant impacts may be responsible for the large observed spread in mean densities, especially for multiple-planet systems that contain planets with very different densities and have not been significantly sculpted by photoevaporation...|$|R
40|$|High energy cosmic {{neutrino}} fluxes can {{be produced}} inside relativistic jets under the envelopes of collapsing stars. In the energy range E ~ (0. 3 - 1 e 5) GeV, flavor conversion of these neutrinos is modified by various matter effects inside the star and the Earth. We present a comprehensive (both analytic and numerical) description of the flavor conversion of these neutrinos which includes: (i) oscillations inside jets, (ii) flavor-to-mass state transitions in an <b>envelope,</b> (iii) <b>loss</b> of coherence {{on the way to}} observer, and (iv) oscillations of the mass states inside the Earth. We show that conversion has several new features which are not realized in other objects, in particular interference effects ("L- and H- wiggles") induced by the adiabaticity violation. The neutrino-neutrino scattering inside jet and inelastic neutrino interactions in the envelope may produce some additional features at E > 1 e 4 GeV. We study dependence of the probabilities and flavor ratios in the matter-affected region on angles theta 13 and theta 23, on the CP-phase delta, {{as well as on the}} initial flavor content and density profile of the star. We show that measurements of the energy dependence of the flavor ratios will, in principle, allow to determine independently the neutrino and astrophysical parameters. Comment: 56 pages, 19 figures.

40|$|We {{show that}} {{collisions}} with stellar [...] mass black holes can partially explain {{the absence of}} bright giant stars in the Galactic Centre, first noted by Genzel et al, 1996. We show that the missing objects are low [...] mass giants and AGB stars in the range 1 - 3 M_. Using detailed stellar evolution calculations, we find that to prevent these objects from evolving to become visible in the depleted K bands, we require that they suffer collisions on the red giant branch, and we calculate the fractional <b>envelope</b> mass <b>losses</b> required. Using a combination of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamic calculations, restricted three [...] body analysis and Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the expected collision rates between giants and black holes, and between giants and main [...] sequence stars in the Galactic Centre. We show that collisions can plausibly explain the missing giants in the 10. 5 <K< 12 band. However, depleting the brighter (K< 10. 5) objects out to the required radius would require a large population of black hole impactors which would in turn deplete the 10. 5 <K< 12 giants in a region much larger than is observed. We conclude that collisions with stellar [...] mass black holes cannot account for the depletion of the very brightest giants, and we use our results to place limits on the population of stellar [...] mass black holes in the Galactic Centre.
