40|$|The {{last decade}} has {{witnessed}} a world trend of fiscal decentralization {{in the developing}} countries as an escape from inadequate growth and inefficient gov-ernance. With respect to China, fiscal decentralization has been a fundamental aspect of its transition to a market economy; and the country has made sub-stantial efforts to break down its highly centralized fiscal management system. China’s fiscal system currently has five levels — central, provincial, prefecture, county, and township. Sub-national governments have been assigned prima-ry responsibility for <b>public</b> <b>services</b> provision and financing. China?s highly decentralized system could {{be a boon to}} managing service delivery, but the country’s crave for rapid economic growth {{in the last two decades}} has kept the reform of the <b>public</b> <b>services</b> on the fringes of political agenda. Under the current arrangements, <b>public</b> <b>services</b> are extensively <b>decentralized</b> with sub-national governments taking a much larger portion of expenditure respon-sibilities that are out of line with international practice. The over-devolution of spending responsibilities has resulted in insufficient financing and provi-sion for core <b>public</b> <b>services,</b> and particularly a default in the delivery of vital services in many rural and poor localities. Further, in the absence of mecha-nisms to ensure national minimum <b>service</b> standards, the <b>decentralized</b> <b>public</b> <b>services</b> delivery system is faced with growing inequality across the country due to the widening regional disparity in economic development over the past decade.

40|$|Participatory {{development}} and government accountability depend {{in part on}} the existence of media that provide broad access to information from varied sources and that equip and encourage people to raise and debate issues and develop public opinion. Conducive policies, laws, and regulations are essential for media to develop that are independent and widely accessible and that enable the expression of diverse perspectives and sources of information. Broadcasting, Voice, and Accountability presents a framework to inform analysis of existing policies and support the development of a vigorous media sector, with a particular emphasis on broadcasting. It focuses on broadcasting because that is the medium with the greatest potential to reach and involve society at large, including the most disadvantaged and illiterate segments of society in developing countries. Information on good practices in broadcasting policy is in demand in countries of every region—particularly in countries that are opening their economies, democratizing, and <b>decentralizing</b> <b>public</b> <b>service</b> delivery. This book provides development practitioners with a wide overview of the key policy and regulatory issues involved in supporting freedom of information and expression and enabling development of a pluralistic, independent, and robust broadcasting sector. Policy, regulation, capacity, and institutional development are important development levers that shape the ownership, content, and social impacts of broadcasting systems. The guide shows the importance of enabling a mix of ownership and uses, commonly classified in terms of commercial, <b>public</b> <b>service,</b> and community broadcasting, that serves the public interest. With the guidance of this book, broadcasting policy and regulation can be tackled as a mainstream development topic, with important consequences for government transparency, government accountability, and enabling disadvantaged constituencies to voice their concerns and press for action. This book is the World Bank's first publication presenting good practices from around the world in media and broadcasting policy and regulation and complements existing work in governance, public sector reform, and access to information.

40|$|The {{decentralization}} of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> {{from central}} to local {{control is a}} major feature of institutional innovation throughout the world. The main argument in support of decentralization is that it brings decisions closer to the people, alleviating information asymmetries, agency costs, and problems of collective decision. However, decentralization can also degrade provision {{in the presence of}} positive spillovers, lack of technical capabilities by local governments, or capture of low-level administrators by local elites. Moreover, decentralization may increase inequality if central provision guarantees similar provision across regions and social groups, whereas some groups are disadvantaged under decentralization. Given these theoretical ambiguities, the superiority of either centralized or <b>decentralized</b> provision of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> is an empirical question. And, despite its importance, there is little rigorous evaluation of decentralization efforts.

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{theory of}} public finance {{has made a}} strong case for a major role for fiscal decentralization.

First, regional or local governments {{are in a position to}} adapt outputs of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> to the preferences and particular circumstances of their constituencies, as compared to a central solution which presumes that one size fits all. Second, in a setting of mobile households, individuals can seek out jurisdictions that provide outputs well suited to their tastes, thereby increasing the potential gains from the <b>decentralized</b> provision of <b>public</b> <b>services</b> (Tiebout 1956). Third, in contrast to the monopolist position of the central government, decentralized levels of government face competition from their neighbors; such competition constrains budgetary growth and provides pressures for the efficient provision of <b>public</b> <b>services.</b> And fourth, decentralization may encourage experimentation and innovation as individual jurisdictions are free to adopt new approaches to public policy; in this way, decentralization can provide a valuable Alaboratory for fiscal experiments. However, this basic economic rationale for decentralization of the public sector is not quite so simple and compelling as it appears. Some of the more recent literature provides, first, a thoughtful and provocative critique of the traditional view of fiscal decentralization, and, second, some new approaches that reveal its dark side, especially in practice. There is emerging, in short, a broader perspective on fiscal decentralization that raises some serious questions about its capacity to provide an unambiguously positive contribution to an improved performance of the public sector.
