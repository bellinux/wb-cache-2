40|$|We {{examine the}} disc [...] <b>jet</b> <b>connection</b> in stellar mass and supermassive black holes by {{investigating}} {{the properties of}} their compact emission in the hard X-ray and radio bands. We compile a sample of ~ 100 active galactic nuclei with measured mass, 5 GHz core emission, and 2 - 10 keV luminosity, together with 8 galactic black holes {{with a total of}} about 50 simultaneous observations in the radio and X-ray bands. Using this sample, we study the correlations between the radio (L_R) and the X-ray (L_X) luminosity and the black hole mass (M). We find that the radio luminosity is correlated with both M and L_X, at a highly significant level. We show how this result can be used to extend the standard unification by orientation scheme to encompass unification by mass and accretion rate. Comment: 10 pages, 4 figures.

40|$|We present {{evidence}} of a direct accretion disk − <b>jet</b> <b>connection</b> in the Galactic microquasar GRS 1915 + 105 based on our analysis of RXTE/PCA data with a “spike ” in X-ray light curves. We find that the radio emission increases as the hardness ratio increases during the low hard state. We suggest that the “spike ” which separates the dips with hard and soft spectra {{marks the beginning of}} the burst phase when the luminosity of the soft X-rays (5 − 15 keV) increases by a large factor (∼ 10). This produces a major ejection episode of the synchrotron- emitting plasma termed as “baby jets ” which are associated with infrared (IR) and radio flares of about half an hour period widely reported in the literature. Subsequent short but frequent soft dips produce overlapping faint flares which result in an enhanced level of quasi-steady emission. We discuss the differences between “baby jets ” and relativistic radio jets and especially investigate their signatures in X-rays.

The limit on the index of a radio – X–ray correlation we find is consistent with the value of ∼ 0. 7 which was found for other black hole candidates in the low/hard state. Interestingly, the limit we find seems more consistent with a value of 1. 4 which was recently shown to be typical for radiatively efficient accretion flow models. We further show that when the correlation–index is the same for two sources one can use the differences in normalisation in the radio – X–ray flux correlation to estimate the distance towards the sources if the distance of one of them is accurately known (assuming black hole spin and mass and jet Lorentz factor differences are unimportant or minimal).

40|$|This paper {{presents}} XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray spectroscopy of ten flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) {{which are}} candidates {{to have an}} X-ray spectrum dominated by jet synchrotron emission. In all these FSRQ, which are less strongly relativistically beamed than blazars, a considerable contribution from a power-law component similar to that present in radio-quiet quasars is required to explain the observed X-ray fluxes and X-ray spectral slopes. And as in radio-quiet quasars, their relatively high optical/UV fluxes can {{be accounted for by}} a significant contribution from thermal accretion disk emission. The lack of success in finding radio quasars with synchrotron X-rays is attributed to the adopted selection criteria, which were based on the multiwavelength flux ratios of BL Lacertae (BL Lac) objects. A refined selection technique, which additionally involves radio imaging, is proposed to search for these important candidates for the Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). On the other hand, the discovered FSRQ with their strong accretion disk signatures are expected to be important probes for studies of the poorly known accretion disk - <b>jet</b> <b>connection.</b> Comment: 27 pages, 6 figures, accepted by Ap...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the Conference Active Flow and Combustion Control 2014, September 10 - 12 2014, Berlin, GermanyAn {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the underlying flow physics of a dual jet interaction fluidic oscillator has been conducted in the transition regime for a Reynolds number of 1680. The transition regime {{is defined as a}} narrow range of flow rates between two other operating modes of the fluidic oscillator. Particle image velocimetry (PIV) was used with refractive index matching sodium iodide solution to minimize reflections from the actuator geometry and obtain detailed internal velocity fields. PIV results showed that the inter-action of the two internal jets and the resultant vortices are responsible for the oscillation mechanism in the transition regime. Two side vortices sustain their existence throughout the oscillation period by altering their size, shape and strength, and a dome vortex is created twice each oscillation period (once from each jet). The dome vortex {{plays a key role in}} the kinetic energy transfer mechanism inside the oscillator by means of jet bifurcations. The primary oscillation mechanism in the transition regime is that each internal <b>jet’s</b> <b>connection</b> with the exiting jet is cut completely by the dome vortex in every period. This is in contrast to the low flow rate oscillation mechanism in which the oscillations are created by continuous collisions of the jets. Furthermore, the internal jets were observed to energize the side vortex on the opposite side of the chamber – a phenomenon which was not observed in the low flow rate regim...|$|R

We compile a sample of 100 active galactic nuclei with measured mass, 5 GHz core emission, and 2 - 10 keV luminosity, together with 8 galactic black holes {{with a total of}} 50 simultaneous observations in the radio and X-ray bands. Using this sample, we study the correlations between the radio (L_R) and the X-ray (L_X) luminosity and the black hole mass (M). We find that the radio luminosity is correlated with both M and L_X, at a highly significant level. In particular, we show that the sources define a "fundamental plane" in the three-dimensional (log L_R,log L_X,log M) space, given by log L_R=(0. 60 ^+ 0. 11 _- 0. 11) log L_X +(0. 78 ^+ 0. 11 _- 0. 09) log M + 7. 33 ^+ 4. 05 _- 4. 07, with a substantial scatter of σ_R= 0. 88. We compare our results to the theoretical relations between radio flux, black hole mass, and accretion rate derived by Heinz and Sunyaev (2003). Such relations depend only on the assumed accretion model and on the observed radio spectral index. Therefore, we are able to show that the X-ray emission from black holes accreting at less than a few per cent of the Eddington rate is unlikely to be produced by radiatively efficient accretion, and is marginally consistent with optically thin synchrotron emission from the jet. On the other hand, models for radiatively inefficient accretion flows seem to agree well with the data. Comment: 21 pages, 8 figures (2 in colour). Revised version accepted for publication by MNRAS.

40|$|VLBI {{observations}} of blazars provide the closest look at compact jets that {{are thought to}} be responsible for the variable emission of blazars from radio to γ-ray wavelengths. It appears that flux variability at different wavelengths is connected to changes in jet structure near its base. The changes happen on timescales of weeks or less, which require frequent VLBI monitoring to follow. Currently, the Very Long Baseline Array is the best tool to perform such observations. Images from the VLBA reveal connections between events in compact jets and behaviour at different wavelengths.

40|$|A {{recently}} developed numerical model, describing a self amplification and structure formation process {{which is used}} to model the initial nonlinear growth phase of edge localized modes (ELMs), is applied to the <b>JET</b> tokamak. <b>Connection</b> length simulations of the magnetic topology, including only error fields, for JET reveal the existence of small, so called short connection length flux tubes.

The change in magnetic topology leads to the formation of new, much larger short connection length flux tubes that can conduct much larger currents through the plasma edge.

Throughout the radio monitoring spanning over two GeV gamma-ray flares detected by the Fermi-LAT and the MAGIC Cherenkov Telescope in the periods of 2009 April to May and 2010 June to August, total flux density in radio band increases on average. This flux increase mostly originates in C 3. Although the gamma-ray flares span on the timescale of days to weeks, no clear correlation with the radio light curve on this timescale is found.
