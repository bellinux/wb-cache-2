Understanding the processes and pathways of hillslope runoff in this environment is, therefore, critical to understanding the water cycle within northern alpine tundra ecosystems. This study: (a) {{presents the results of}} a field study on runoff from a sub-alpine tundra hillslope with a large snow drift during the spring melt period; (b) identifies the major runoff processes that must be represented in simulations of snowmelt runoff from sub-alpine tundra hillslopes; (c) describes how these processes can be represented in a numerical simulation model; and (d) compares field measurements with modelled output to validate or refute the conceptual understanding of runoff generation embodied in the process simulations. The study was conducted at Granger Creek catchment, 15 km south of Whitehorse, Yukon Territory, Canada, on a north-facing slope below a late-lying snow drift. For the freshet period, the major processes to be represented in a runoff model include the rate of meltwater release from the late-lying snowdrift, the elevation and thickness of the saturated layer, the magnitude of the soil permeability and its variation with depth. The daily cycle of net all-wave radiation was observed to drive the diurnal pulses of melt water from the drift; this, in turn, was found to control the daily pulses of flow through the hillslope subsurface and in the stream channel. The computed rate of frost table lowering fell within the observed values; however, there was wide variation among the measured <b>frost</b> <b>depths.</b> Spatial variability in <b>frost</b> table <b>depth</b> would result in spatial variabilities in saturated layer and depth thickness, which would, in turn, produce variations in subsurface flow rates over the slope, including preferential flowpaths...|$|R

Steps for model formulation and details of boundary conditions are described. The formulation was based on a transient conductive heat transfer analysis. Conventional earth temperature theories were modified for landfill systems by incorporating heat generation functions representing biological decomposition of wastes. Finite element analysis was used for general modeling and parametric evaluations. Thermal properties of materials were determined using field observations and data reported in literature. The boundary conditions consisted of seasonal temperature cycles at the ground surface (established using near-surface field measurements) and constant temperatures at the far-field boundary (established using field measurements and maps of regional groundwater temperatures). For heat generation, first a step-function was developed to provide initial (aerobic) and residual (anaerobic) conditions. Second, an exponential growth-decay function was established; and third, the function was scaled for climatic conditions.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of <b>frost</b> table <b>depths</b> on a peat-covered permafrost slope was examined in a discontinuous permafrost region in northern Canada over 4 consecutive {{years at a}} variety of spatial scales, to elucidate the role of active layer development on runoff generation. <b>Frost</b> table <b>depths</b> were highly variable over relatively short distances (0. 25 – 1 m), and the spatial variability was strongly correlated to soil moisture distribution, which was partly influenced by lateral flow converging to frost table depressions. On an interannual basis, thaw rates were temporally correlated to air temperature and the amount of precipitation input. Simple simulations show that lateral subsurface flow is governed by the frost table topography having spatially variable storage that has to be filled before water can spill over to generate flow downslope, in a similar manner that bedrock topography controls subsurface flow. However, unlike the bedrock surface, the frost table is variable with time and strongly influenced by the heat transfer involving water.

Thermal properties of materials were determined using experimental testing, field observations, and data reported in literature. The boundary conditions consisted of seasonal temperature cycles at the ground surface and constant temperatures at the far-field boundary.

GPR-based estimates were compared to datafrom thermistors and frost tubes, which estimate soil <b>frost</b> <b>depth</b> with a color indicating solution. In theabsence of snow, frost was initially detected {{at a depth of}} 8 – 10 cm. Dry snow up to 35 cm deep, enhancednear-surface frost detection, raising the minimum frost detection depth to 4 – 5 cm. The most favorablesurface conditions for GPR detection were bare soil or shallow dry snow where frost had penetrated to theminimum detectable depth. Unfavorable conditions included: standing water on frozen soil, wet snow,thawed surface soils and deep snow pack.

Since soil frost strongly affects snowmelt infiltration and runoff, the reduction in <b>frost</b> <b>depth</b> may have altered the water and nutrient cycles in this region. A paired‐plot experiment was conducted in an agricultural field in Tokachi, Hokkaido, to compare the movement of soil water at different frost depths, controlled by manipulating the depth of snow cover.

The soil froze to a maximum depth of 0. 43 m under the treatment plot and 0. 11 m under the control plot. During the freezing period, the amount of upward soil water flux toward the freezing front in the treatment plot was more than double that in the control plot.

Cover temperatures varied seasonally similarly to air temperatures and demonstrated amplitude decrement and phase lag with depth. Elevated temperatures in the underlying wastes resulted in warmer temperatures and low frost penetration in the covers compared to surrounding subgrade soils. The ranges of measured temperatures decreased and average temperatures generally increased (approximately 2 °C/m) with depth. The ranges of measured temperatures (Tmax−Tmin) were 18 – 30 °C and 13 – 21 °C and the average temperatures were 13 – 18 °C and 14 – 23 °C at 1 and 2 m depths, respectively.

In the southern boreal regions, particularly on sandy glacial tills, drought in early summer is also noticeable. This, which somewhat counterbalances the effect of L, was roughly estimated. The partial derivatives of G with respect to the effective temperature sum L and winter’s maximum soil <b>frost</b> <b>depth</b> F were approximated by those obtained earlier by the author from spatial analysis. Applying the relation between Ef and the volume of growing stands K as obtained by Hyvärinen et al. (1995) and the mean ratio G/K on the basis of forest inventories, as well as the derivatives of Ef with respect to L and F, the temporal standard deviations of G and Ef could be roughly approximated for various regions south of the Arctic Circle in Finland. The results were verified by the actual temporal standard deviations of G found in ring-width studies, and evaporation observed by the Class–A pan. The results of this study, albeit rough, were of the right magnitude. It was also shown that the mean snow depth during winter more affected the soil <b>frost</b> <b>depth,</b> Ef and G, than did the frost sum.

40|$|After {{the winter}} of 1962 - 1963 the frost damage in the Netherlands to road constructions was enormous. The "Studie Centrum Wegenbouw" made {{inquiries}} on road constructors about this damage. A special commision was brought together to look after these inquiries. It proved that many physical aspects about frost penetration were unknown. One of the activities therefore {{had to be a}} study on frost penetration into soils. For this reason a new freezing model is derived. With this model values for <b>frost</b> <b>depths</b> and heave can be calculated with it. The new model differs from known models because of different assumptions. Two important conditions are the original temperature distribution and the original water distribution. Both are assumed to be linear functions of place. The interpretation of masstransport and frozen fringe differs from Jones and Miller. The transport is in agreement with Darcy's law. However, the quantity of transported mass is not only depending on the waterpotentialgradient itself, but also on the location of this gradient and on time. The importance of the factor time follows from the heatfluxes at the freezingfront. Model values are compared with experimental results. Three different types of setups are used. A closed system (no free water) was used to investigate the influence of watercontent on frost penetration. Moisted silversand was applied. The volumemetric watercontent, changed to 6 %. By the so called T. R. R. L. method an opensystem (free water available) was copied. Moistured morainesand was used. Measured frostdepths and heaves are compared with calculated values.

Airtemperatures and frostdepths were measured during winterperiods. The measurements of the winter 1979 are used here. Unfortunately there was no knowledge about several thermal parameters.

40|$|Long-term {{data from}} the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest in New Hampshire show that air {{temperature}} has increased by about 1 °C over the last half century. The warmer climate has caused significant declines in snow depth, snow water equivalent and snow cover duration. Paradoxically, {{it has been suggested}} that warmer air temperatures may result in colder soils and more soil frost, as warming leads to a reduction in snow cover insulating soils during winter. Hubbard Brook has one of the longest records of direct field measurements of soil frost in the United States. Historical records show no long-term trends in maximum annual <b>frost</b> <b>depth,</b> which is possibly confounded by high interannual variability and infrequency of major soil frost events. As a complement to field measurements, soil frost can be modelled reliably using knowledge of the physics of energy and water transfer. We simulated soil freezing and thawing to the year 2100 using a soil energy and water balance model driven by statistically downscaled climate change projections from three atmosphere-ocean general circulation models under two emission scenarios. Results indicated no major changes in maximum annual <b>frost</b> <b>depth</b> and only a slight increase in number of freeze–thaw events. The most important change suggested by the model is a decline in the number of days with soil frost, stemming from a concurrent decline in the number of snow-covered days.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} to cold regions hydrology and northern {{water resources management}} lies in predicting runoff dynamically {{in the context of}} warming-induced changes to the rates and patterns of ground thaw and drainage. Meeting this challenge requires new knowledge of the mechanisms and rates of ground thaw and their implications to water drainage and storage patterns and processes. The study carries out to evaluate the concept of energy-based runoff in the perspective of ground heat flux, soil thaw and liquid moisture content, tortuosity of snow-free area, preferential flow and discharge of the hillslope. Based on field measurements, coupled energy and water flow is simulated in the Area of Interest (AOI) with a half-hour time interval by the distributed hydrological model, GEOtop. In the field, the saturated hydraulic conductivity varies exponentially between the superficial organic layer and the underlying mineral layer. In the simulation, the parameters of the soil physical properties are input by fourteen uneven layers below the ground surface. Starting from the initially frozen state, the process of soil thaw is simulated with dynamic variables such as soil liquid moisture and ice content, hydraulic conductivity, thermal conductivity and heat capacity. The simulated <b>frost</b> table <b>depths</b> are validated by 44 -point measurements and the simulation of point soil temperature is also compared to data measured in an excavated soil pit. As a result, the frost table topography is dominated by both the snow-free pattern and the energy fluxes on the ground surface. The rate and magnitude of runoff derived from snow drift and the ice content of frozen soil is greatly influenced by the frost table topography. According to the simulation, the <b>frost</b> table <b>depth</b> is closely regressed with the ground surface temperature by a power function. As soil thawing progresses, ground heat flux reduces gradually and the rate of soil thaw becomes small when the frost table descends. Along with the snow-free area expanding, the average soil moisture of the AOI increases prior to that time when the average frost table is less than 25 cm deep. The snow-free patches expand heterogeneously in the AOI, which causes the spatial and temporal variation of hydraulic conductivity due to the non-uniform <b>frost</b> table <b>depth.</b> According to the simulation, the transit time of the flow through the AOI decreases to the shortest span on May 13 with the average frost table of 10 cm. Before this date, the time lag between snowmelt percolation and slope runoff is about 8 - 10 hours; while after this date, the time lag is no more than 5 hours. The pattern of the preferential flow in the AOI highly depends on the frost table topography. When the snow-free patches are widely scattered and the average frost table is between 0 and 10 cm, the preferential flow paths are inhibited. With soil thaw progresses, the preferential flow paths are prominent with the largest single contributing area occurring when the average frost table is between 10 cm to 15 cm. When the average frost table reaches 25 cm, the importance of preferential flow is not apparent, and matrix flow prevails...|$|R
50|$|The Earth's mass absorbs and retains heat. Over time, {{this heat}} is {{released}} to surrounding areas, {{such as an}} earth shelter. Because of the high density of the earth, change in the earth’s temperature occurs slowly. This is known as ‘thermal lag.’ Because of this principle, the earth provides a fairly constant temperature for the underground shelters, even when the outdoor temperature undergoes great fluctuation. In most of the United States, the average temperature of the earth once below the frost line is between 55 and 57 degrees Fahrenheit (13 to 14 degrees Celsius). <b>Frost</b> line <b>depths</b> vary from region to region. In the USA frost lines can range from just under the surface to more than 40 inches. Thus, {{at the base of}} a deep earth berm, the house is heated against an exterior temperature gradient of perhaps ten to fifteen degrees, instead of against a steeper temperature grade where air is on the outside of the wall instead of earth. During the summer, the temperature gradient helps to cool the house.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Bricks of {{tunnels and}} bridges of Usui Pass railway (Japan) exposed to north {{are subject to}} <b>frost</b> damage. Average <b>depth</b> of erosion due to {{detachment}} of angular blocks is around 1 – 1. 5 cm. In order to assess this weathering and to understand its mechanism, an experimental study {{was carried out in}} the field and laboratory. Field monitoring showed the combination of seasonal and diurnal freezing with a maximum of heave when the freezing front reached 5 cm depth. Bricks taken from the site were submitted to unidirectional freezing at capillary and vacuum saturation in the laboratory. Results showed that frost damage of bricks was favoured by high saturation level and repetition of freeze-thaw cycles. ...|$|R
