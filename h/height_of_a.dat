5|$|August 27–28, 1878 – Streets are {{clogged with}} fallen trees as a {{hurricane}} passes to the north. At the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> storm, a floating dry dock—the largest ever {{built at the}} time—is damaged after breaking from its moorings at HM Dockyard, crushing wharves and a mooring bridge. The dock {{came to rest on}} a breakwater.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses in the {{vicinity}} of Seven-Mile Beach estimated that the aircraft reached a <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> little above 400ft (122m) before turning left slightly and descending steeply. The aircraft cleared the land and crashed into Frederick Henry Bay about 300yards (275m) beyond the water's edge and a mile (1.6km) from the western end of Seven-Mile Beach. After takeoff it flew for less than 2 minutes and covered a distance of only 2.9nautical miles (5.4km).|$|E
5|$|Al-Biruni (973–1048) {{measured}} the {{radius of the}} earth using a new method. It involved observing the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mountain at Nandana (now in Pakistan). Al-Idrisi (1100–1166) created {{a map of the}} world for Roger, the Norman King of Sicily. He also wrote the Book of Roger, a geographic study of the peoples, climates, resources and industries of the whole of the world known at that time. The Ottoman admiral Piri Reis (c. 1470–1553) made a map of the New World and West Africa in 1513. He made use of maps from Greece, Portugal, Muslim sources, and perhaps one made by Christopher Columbus. He was part of a major tradition of Ottoman cartography.|$|E

5|$|Don't Starve was Klei's {{first foray}} into the {{survival}} genre. Conceived during the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> game industry trend of dropping players into a world with few instructions and a goal of survival, the game was influenced by Minecraft, which spearheaded this trend, {{as well as by}} filmmaker Tim Burton. The game received positive reviews from critics; commended for its original art style, music, and variety of ways for the player to die, although its high level of difficulty and implementation of permanent death were less warmly received.|$|E
5|$|Hollywood Rip Ride Rockit is a steel {{roller coaster}} at Universal Studios Florida in Orlando, Florida. With a <b>height</b> <b>of</b> , <b>a</b> length of , {{and a top}} speed of , it is the largest X-Coaster ever built by German {{manufacturer}} Maurer Söhne. It was announced on March 19, 2008 and officially opened on August 19, 2009 though originally planned to open in the spring of that year. Some of the special features are that riders are recorded during the entire 1 minute and 37 second ride and can choose one of thirty songs to listen to during the experience.|$|E
5|$|Various factors {{lay behind}} this sudden mass response. Economically, the news {{had reached the}} US at the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> series of {{financial}} recessions and bank failures in the 1890s. The gold standard of the time tied paper money {{to the production of}} gold and shortages {{towards the end of the}} 19th century meant that gold dollars were rapidly increasing in value ahead of paper currencies and being hoarded. This had contributed to the Panic of 1893 and Panic of 1896, which caused unemployment and financial uncertainty. There was a huge, unresolved demand for gold across the developed world that the Klondike promised to fulfil and, for individuals, the region promised higher wages or financial security.|$|E

5|$|After {{unearthing}} {{an ancient}} crossbow device from a house's garden in Haichow, Jiangsu, Shen {{discovered that the}} cross-wire grid sighting device, marked in graduated measurements on the stock, {{could be used to}} calculate the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> distant mountain {{in the same way that}} mathematicians could apply right-angle triangles to measure height. Needham asserts Shen had discovered the survey device known as Jacob's staff, which was not described elsewhere until the Provençal Jewish mathematician Levi ben Gerson (1288–1344) wrote of it in 1321. Shen wrote that while viewing the whole of a mountain, the distance on the instrument was long, but while viewing a small part of the mountainside the distance was short due to the device's cross piece that had to be pushed further away from the observer's eye, with the graduation starting on the further end. He wrote that if one placed an arrow on the device and looked past its end, the degree of the mountain could be measured and thus its height could be calculated.|$|E
5|$|Internationally, Victoria took a keen {{interest}} in the improvement of relations between France and Britain. She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans, who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845, she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe I at château d'Eu in Normandy; she was the first British or English monarch to visit a French one since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis I of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made a reciprocal trip in 1844, he became the first French king to visit a British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848, and fled to exile in England. At the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848, Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House, a private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support, and the scare died down without any major disturbances. Victoria's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was a public relations success, but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism.|$|E

The height of knitted and crocheted stitches is also different: a single crochet stitch is twice the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knit stitch in the same yarn size and comparable diameter tools, and a double crochet stitch is about four times the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> knit stitch.|$|E

50|$|An AVL tree is <b>a</b> kind <b>of</b> {{balanced}} {{binary search}} tree {{in which the two}} children of each internal node must have heights that differ by at most one.

Thus, the <b>height</b> function <b>of</b> <b>an</b> AVL tree obeys the constraints <b>of</b> <b>a</b> WAVL tree, and we may convert any AVL tree into a WAVL tree by using the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> each node as its rank.|$|R
