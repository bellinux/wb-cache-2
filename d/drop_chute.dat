50|$|Wood pellet {{heating systems}} work with {{different}} techniques of charging and combustion: Today there are specifically developed loading techniques for pellet combustion like <b>drop</b> <b>chute</b> firing, underfeed firing, side-fed firing {{or the use}} of a roller grate system. The method of charging and combustion of the pellet fuel is divided into 5 technologies.|$|E
5000|$|Drop shaft burner - Pellets {{slide down}} a <b>drop</b> <b>chute</b> into a burn pot. This way the {{combustion}} area is exactly defined, combustion {{can therefore be}} exactly controlled. With this technology the least rest ash remains compared with other systems and {{can be carried out}} of the burn pot by cleaning mechanisms. This type of charging is usually used for Pellet stoves.|$|E

50|$|Mining {{sites such}} as Dolaucothi and Las Medulas in {{northwest}} Spain show multiple aqueducts that fed water from local rivers to the mine head. The channels may have deteriorated rapidly, or become redundant as the nearby ore was exhausted. Las Medulas shows at least seven such leats, and Dolaucothi at least five. At Dolaucothi, the miners used holding reservoirs as well as hushing tanks, and sluice gates to control flow, as well as <b>drop</b> <b>chutes</b> for diversion of water supplies. The remaining traces (see palimpsest) of such channels allows the mining sequence to be inferred.A number of other sites fed by several aqueducts {{have not yet been}} thoroughly explored or excavated, such as those at Longovicium near Lanchester south of Hadrian's wall, in which the water supplies may have been used to power trip-hammers for forging iron.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{method of}} disposing human waste from trains is to deposit the waste onto the tracks using {{what is known}} as a hopper toilet. This ranges from a hole in the floor to a full-flush system (possibly with sterilization). The hole in the floor (also known as a <b>drop</b> <b>chute</b> toilet) system is still in use {{in many parts of the}} world, particularly on older rolling stock. The principal disadvantage is that it can be considered crude or unhygienic and dangerous to health and the environment - it litters the railway lines and can convey serious health risks when the train passes over or under a navigable waterway. Passengers may be discouraged from flushing or using toilets while the train is at a station or standing at a red signal. To enforce this limitation, toilets may be automatically locked when the train pulls into a station or stops at a red signal.|$|E
40|$|This {{video is}} a {{compilation}} of three short videos related to the Galileo mission. The first section shows animation of the descent of the Galileo probe into the atmosphere of Jupiter. It includes cutaway views of the atmosphere showing the different layers. This descent will represent the first entry into the atmosphere of an outer planet in our solar system. A second section shows some live shots of the development and <b>drop</b> <b>chute</b> tests of the Galileo spacecraft. A third section is an animation that shows the Probe mission. It shows visualizations from the launch, including the Venus flyby, {{the separation of the}} probe and the orbiter, and the trajectory of the planetary arrival. It also shows the descent of the probe into the atmosphere...|$|E

5000|$|Galactica {{is capable}} of hyper jump travel, {{although}} while escorting the refugee fleet she must limit her speed {{to that of the}} slowest ship. [...] She has a complement of about 150 Vipers: 25 surviving fighters from her own pre-Holocaust squadrons, 42 from the other battlestars at the Peace Conference, and the remainder being transfers from Pegasus. Galactica also has a complement of shuttles. Unlike similar civilian models, these transport craft include military gear for detecting electronic emissions from other spacecraft, and <b>drop</b> <b>chutes</b> for paratroop assaults. In addition, Galactica has armored, tracked ground vehicles known as [...] "landrams" [...] and [...] "snowrams." [...] These are armed with a single heavy laser cannon in an open turret on the roof, and are landed by shuttles. Galactica carries a large number of manually aimed laser batteries, both for anti-aircraft defense against fighters and for engaging other capital ships. As to purely defensive measures, Galactica is protected by both [...] "electronic shields" [...] and a heavy metal double-pocket hatch shield that covers its panoramic bridge viewport; the latter is closed in [...] "positive shield" [...] state and open in [...] "negative shield" [...] state. However, while these might provide limited protection, they are insufficient to guard against suicide ramming runs by Cylon raiders or pulsar-cannon fire from Cylon base ships. Galactica also has the ability to project a broad cone of energy, wide enough to cover much of one hemisphere of an Earth-sized planet, that is powerful enough to destroy ballistic missiles and their nuclear warheads.|$|R

50|$|Most barns were {{equipped}} with several chutes {{along the sides}} {{and in the center}} of the loft floor. This permitted bales to be dropped into the area where they were to be used. Hay bales would be <b>dropped</b> through side <b>chutes,</b> to be broken up and fed to the cattle. Straw bales would be dropped down the center chute, to be distributed as bedding in the livestock standing/resting areas.|$|R
50|$|Further Processing plants {{carry out}} {{operations}} such as cutting and deboning.Previously the conveyor belts carrying live chickens generally ran at {{a maximum of}} 140 chickens per minute, but the maximum speed has been increased to 175 birds/minute. Once the dead birds arrive in the evisceration room (usually <b>dropped</b> down a <b>chute</b> after the feet are removed), they are hung again on shackles {{much the same way}} as they were when they were alive.|$|R
50|$|After mixing, {{the rubber}} charge is <b>dropped</b> into a <b>chute</b> and fed by an {{extruding}} screw into a roller die. Alternatively, the batch can be dropped onto an open rubber mill batchoff system. A mill consists of twin counter-rotating rolls, one serrated, that provide additional mechanical working to the rubber {{and produce a}} thick rubber sheet. The sheet is pulled off the rollers {{in the form of}} a strip. The strip is cooled, dusted with talc, and laid down into a pallet bin.|$|R
50|$|The {{games are}} played indoors in a {{custom-built}} futuristic arena and {{are based on}} standard FA seven-a-side rules, but {{with a handful of}} innovations. The key rules: Matches are ten minutes each way (fifteen each way in the final). Play starts with 'The Drop', where the ball is <b>dropped</b> from a <b>chute</b> in the ceiling 10m above the centre spot. The last minute of each half is deemed a 'PowerPlay', any goals scored during that time count double. Players guilty of persistent foul play are shown a blue rather than yellow card and spend two minutes in 'The Cooler' (a sin bin).|$|R
5000|$|Wool was weighed, conveyed, classed, baled, branded, stored, displayed, marketed and sold. [...] Within {{multi-storey}} ‘wool-warehouses’ bales {{were moved}} on trolleys, by steam or hydraulic lifts and <b>dropped</b> down <b>chutes.</b> Within the one-storey modern wool store, wool {{was moved by}} vehicles. Improvements made to Woolstores in the 1940s included metal wool gates for dividing the wool, electric lifts and elevators, wool presses and wool drops. [...] Wool brokers charged growers a fee for handling and selling the wool in the store. Brokers also provided a range of other services such as credit facilities, banking, advice, and hotel and travel bookings. They linked the wool grower {{to the outside world}} of commerce and international trade. As buildings that were visited by clients, whether they be buyers or suppliers, the stores had to provide a reasonable level of amenity and could not simply be regarded as large sheds. Changing rooms and showers were also installed in the larger Woolstores for use of buyers and growers and of course the offices of wool valuers.|$|R
60|$|That was why I left Washington--not {{on account}} of the mulatto, but {{on account of}} the bulls. I went down to the depot and caught the first blind out on a Pennsylvania Railroad express. After the train got good and under way and I noted the speed she was making, a misgiving smote me. This was a four-track railroad, and the engines took water on the fly. Hoboes had long since warned me never to ride the first blind on trains where the engines took water on the fly. And now let me explain. Between the tracks are shallow metal troughs. As the engine, at full speed, passes above, a sort of <b>chute</b> <b>drops</b> down into the trough. The result is that all the water in the trough rushes up the chute and fills the tender.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Abrupt {{changes of}} the channel bed {{elevation}} in hydraulic systems, e. g. in <b>chutes,</b> <b>drops</b> and steeped spillways, results to create a sever flow kinematic energy. This excess energy, can tend to different phenomena, such as tremendous forces, scouring and degrading the channel bed, resulting to destruction of the downstream hydraulic structures. The most important source to cause this phenomena is the the existence of sequent vertical drops along the the channel. In this study, the energy dissipation efficiency was increased by installing {{a new type of}} dissipaters namely netting dissipater on the crest of the vertical drops based on model experimtation. Also, the features of hydraulic jump, created in the stilling basin, were compared to those of a simple vertical drop. By assembling the above mentioned structure {{to the top of the}} stilling basin, the jet flow direction is changed, the degree of turbulence is increased and as the results, the kinematic energy loss increases and the length of the hydraulic jump decreses. The enhanced efficiency of the proposed structure was quantified based on the achieved experimental data...|$|R
40|$|The Mulled Coal {{process was}} {{developed}} {{as a means of}} overcoming the adverse handling characteristics of wet fine coal without thermal drying. The process involves the addition of a low cost harmless reagent to wet fine coal using off-the-shelf mixing equipment. Based on laboratory- and bench-scale testing, Mulled Coal can be stored, shipped, and burned without causing any of the plugging, pasting, carryback and freezing problems normally associated with wet coal. The objectives of this project are to demonstrate that: The Mulled Coal process, which has been proven to work {{on a wide range of}} wet fine coals at bench scale, will work equally well in a commercial coal preparation plant. The wet product from a fine coal cleaning circuit can be converted to a solid fuel form for ease of handling and cost savings in storage and rail car transportation. A wet fine coal product thus converted to a solid fuel form can be stored, shipped, and burned with conventional fuel handling, transportation, and combustion systems. The Mulled Coal circuit was installed in an empty bay at the Chetopa Preparation Plant. Equipment has been installed to divert a 2. 7 tonnes/hr (3 tons/hr) slipstream of the froth concentrate to a dewatering centrifuge. The concentrated wet coal fines from the centrifuge <b>dropped</b> through a <b>chute</b> directly into a surge hopper and feed system for the Mulled Coal circuit. The Mulled Coal product was gravity discharged from the circuit to a truck or product discharge area from which it will be hauled to a stockpile located at the edge of the clean coal stockpile area. During the 3 -month operating period, the facility produced 870 tonnes (966 tons) of the Muffed Coal for evaluation in various storage, handling, and transportation equipment and operations. Immediately following the production demonstration, the circuit was disassembled and the facility was decommissioned...|$|R
