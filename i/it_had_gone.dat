5|$|In December 1996, Patton {{called a}} special {{legislative}} session {{to consider the}} issue of worker's compensation reform. Both Patton and the state's legislators believed that the generous benefits provided under Kentucky state law created an unfavorable business climate in the state. The reform measures adopted in the special session included a substantial reduction in benefits, including those to coal miners who developed black lung disease. Patton's support of this measure alienated labor leaders, especially in eastern Kentucky's coal mining communities – which had previously been among his strongest supporters. As the law began to take effect, Patton himself agreed that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> too far, and his Secretary of Labor worked with representatives from organized labor to draft changes in the law. Those changes were eventually made in the 2002 legislative session.|$|E
5|$|Mackintosh's party, {{which left}} the ship {{on the morning}} of 3 January, {{consisted}} of Mackintosh and three sailors, with a sledge containing supplies and a large mailbag. Two sailors quickly returned to the ship, while Mackintosh and one companion went forward. They camped on the ice that evening, only to find next day that the whole area around them had broken up. After a desperate dash over the moving floes, they managed to reach a small glacier tongue. They camped there, and waited for several days for their snow-blindness to subside. When their vision returned, they found that Cape Royds was in sight but inaccessible, as the sea-ice leading to <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone,</b> leaving a stretch of open water. They {{had little choice but to}} make for the hut by land, a dangerous undertaking without appropriate equipment and experience.|$|E

One Direction made US chart history as the feat {{marks the first time}} a music DVD had outsold the Billboard 200 number one album. Its opening figure also makes it the highest music DVD debut of 2012 and the second highest debut {{in the past five years}} behind Adele's Live at the Royal Albert Hall, which {{launched}} at number one in December 2011, with 96,000 copies. In the week ending 27 January 2013, Up All Night: The Live Tour claimed its 30th week on top of the Top Music Videos Chart, which is longer than any other title since the chart originated in March 1995. It surpassed Ray Stevens' Comedy Video Classics, which logged 29 weeks on top in 1993-1994. The recording was ultimately certified five times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on 29 May 2013, indicating shipments of 500,000 copies. In Mexico the DVD debuted at number-one of the Music DVD Chart selling over 10,000 copies, being certified Gold in its first week.

5|$|Marsden reappears on Albert Square in 2009 when Archie Mitchell (Larry Lamb) is murdered. She {{arrives on}} the scene when several people say they suspect Janine Butcher (Charlie Brooks), but Marsden waits before {{questioning}} her, and questions the Mitchells first. She makes a televised appeal for witnesses and later interviews Phil, but he is provided an alibi by his girlfriend Shirley Carter (Linda Henry). A few days later, a red fingernail is found {{at the scene of}} the murder; Marsden visits the female locals, checking their hands. Seeing an upset Heather Trott (Cheryl Fergison), knowing that she is vulnerable and lives with Shirley, she talks to Heather about Christmas Day and Heather accidentally tells Marsden that Phil wasn't there. Marsden interviews Phil and later visits his home, asking to see the clothes he was wearing on Christmas Day. Shirley shows her a clean shirt; Marsden closes the laundrette, hoping anyone with blood-stained clothes will not be able to wash them. After a tip-off Marsden arrests Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); Sam accuses her mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), of the murder. Marsden confirms that she was there to talk to Peggy, questioning Peggy and Sam at the police station. Peggy is released without charge; however, Sam is detained for jumping bail. Marsden visits Janine, who insists that people will say anything to get her in trouble. She asks Janine why she was out in the cold on Christmas Day, and asks if Janine knows where Archie's laptop as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> missing.|$|E

25|$|Terohaute's {{explanation}} was that Hood had been cleaning {{his gun and}} that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> off, shooting him through the head. The claim was self-evidently absurd; the rifle was too long {{for a man to}} shoot himself with, moreover Hood {{had been shot in the}} back of the head, apparently while reading a book. But with Terohaute stronger than them and armed, there was nothing John Hepburn and Richardson could do for the next three days, as Terohaute refused to let them out of his sight and became more and more aggressive, repeatedly asking to know if they thought he had murdered Hood. Finally, on 23 October, Terohaute left them for a short time to gather lichen. Richardson took the opportunity to load his pistol, and on Terohaute's return, shot him dead.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after reading}} Price's sermon, Burke wrote {{a draft of}} what {{eventually}} became, Reflections on the Revolution in France. On 13 February 1790, a notice in the press said that shortly, Burke would publish a pamphlet on the Revolution and its British supporters, however he spent the year revising and expanding it. On 1 November he finally published the Reflections {{and it was an}} immediate best-seller. Priced at five shillings, it was more expensive than most political pamphlets, {{but by the end of}} 1790, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> through ten printings and sold approximately 17,500 copies. A French translation appeared on 29 November and on 30 November the translator, Pierre-Gaëton Dupont, wrote to Burke saying 2,500 copies had already been sold. The French translation ran to ten printings by June 1791.|$|E
25|$|Included in that haul {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous caughts-and-bowled ever taken. Ulyett sent down a {{straight}} half-volley to Bonnor, who drove at it with all his considerable might and got it right out of the middle of the bat. The ball flew back towards the bowler with a resounding crack. It seemed to Ulyett barely to have left his hand—yet already it was flying back to him at what seemed like the speed of light. He had no time to judge it but held out the right hand instinctively, and the leather stuck, right in the middle of his palm. With the sound of Bonnor's stroke still echoing about the ground, many eyes in the gallery were looking for the area near the boundary where they thought that the ball would land. The eyes of George Giffen, the non-striker, were among the wanderers, and he was certain that everyone else must be looking for it, too: indeed, a segment of the crowd, in panic, had even opened up a space in the ring in anticipation of the ball’s descent. Giffen reckoned it to have been a very mighty drive indeed—but he could not see where <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone.</b> When, finally, his and other eyes were diverted back towards the pitch, they noticed Ulyett celebrating and Bonnor was departing. It soon dawned on them that Ulyett had taken the catch. Although Ulyett felt no pain in the centre of his hand, there was definitely a fair amount of it on the outside. Bonnor looked at him disgustedly, thinking it almost immoral to have done such a thing, and he walked off gloomily. The England players gathered around Ulyett in wonderment. They seemed to the Wisden correspondent to be curious as to what kind of man this was—although they were also keen to congratulate him on his evasion of impending danger. The looks on the faces of Allan Steel and Alfred Lyttelton would stay with Wisdens man for a long time. WG Grace and Lord Harris both told Ulyett that he was foolish to have attempted to take the catch: had it hit his wrist or arm instead, that bone would surely have snapped. Giffen believed that this {{was one of the}} finest catches that he had ever seen, and, although on the team which it had adversely affected, he definitely appreciated it.|$|E

After the self-immolation, however, the media campaign against the group gained significant traction. Posters, leaflets and videos were produced detailing the supposed detrimental effects of Falun Gong practice, and regular anti-Falun Gong classes were scheduled in schools. CNN compared the government's propaganda initiative to past political movements such as the Korean War and the Cultural Revolution. Later, as public opinion turned against the group, the Chinese authorities began sanctioning the [...] "systematic use of violence" [...] to eliminate Falun Gong. In the year following the incident, Freedom House claimed that the imprisonment, torture, and deaths of Falun Gong practitioners in custody increased significantly.|$|E

Nixon's campaign manager claimed to have proof of Voorhis's involvement with the group. On September 13, the two candidates met at a debate at South Pasadena Junior High School. When Nixon was challenged to produce proof of the allegation, Nixon took from his pocket a local bulletin of the National Citizens Political Action Committee that contained an endorsement of Voorhis. This was a different group, also affiliated with the CIO. While Voorhis's staff was aware of this endorsement, no one had told the representative. Voorhis, confronted with the bulletin, noted that these were two different groups. Nixon responded by reading the names of the boards of directors of the two groups, with many names in common. After the debate, Voorhis asked Congressman Chester E. Holifield for his view of how <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>gone,</b> and Holifield responded, [...] "Jerry, he cut you to pieces." [...] Voorhis had been successfully linked with [...] "the PAC", though he had refused to accept the endorsement of any PAC unless it renounced Communist influence.
