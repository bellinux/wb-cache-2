2500|$|On March 3, 1865, the {{day before}} Lincoln's second inauguration, Grant wired to Washington that Lee had sent representatives to him to sue for peace. Lincoln {{initially}} told Grant that he should get peace with the South by any means necessary. Stanton declared, however, {{that it is the}} president's duty to sue for peace; otherwise, the president is useless and little more than a figure-head. This engendered an immediate change of tone from the president. Stanton, at Lincoln's urging, told Grant that he was to [...] "have no conference with General Lee unless it be for the capitulation of Gen. Lee's army, or on some minor, and purely, military matter". Further, Grant was not to [...] "decide, discuss, or confer upon any political questions. Such matters the President holds in his own hands; and will submit them to no military conferences or conventions". Grant agreed. Days later, Lincoln visited Grant at his siege headquarters (the Siege of Petersburg was still ongoing). Once Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan had rejoined his army from the Shenandoah Valley, Grant was prepared to make his final push into Richmond. On April 1, 1865, Sheridan defeated Lee's army in the Battle of Five Forks, forcing a retreat from Petersburg. Stanton, who had stayed close to his telegraph for days, told his wife the following evening: [...] "Petersburg is evacuated and probably Richmond. Put out your flags." [...] Stanton was worried that President Lincoln, who had stayed around to watch Grant's push into Richmond, was in danger of being captured, and warned him. Lincoln disagreed, but was happy for Stanton's concern. The President wrote Stanton: [...] "It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> to-morrow." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not. <b>I</b> {{know that}} it is wrong. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> down <b>there,</b> and tell him that it must not--must not be so. But I may stay at The Cleeve;--may I not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Think {{you very}} much. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> round <b>there</b> in the morning, and will call at your office {{afterwards}} {{and let you}} know if I have arranged the matter, and the time at which I am to call to inspect the mortgage." ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{the end of}} half an hour Edgar said: [...] "I {{think that}} they must have cleared off by this time. When we sally out, do you, Albert, go one way, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> another. <b>There</b> is naught in our dress to {{distinguish}} us from other citizens, and methinks {{that most of those}} who would have known us again are lying under the ruins above." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} were looking wonderfully tidy," [...] Dick said, smiling. [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> at once. I shall feel a new man, after a bath." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where is that? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> {{and shame}} him before them all. Don't you feel no shame? Because you've got things {{comfortable}} here, I suppose it's all nothing to you. You don't care, though {{my children were}} starving in the gutter,--as they will do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So we have," [...] Percy said. [...] "He was to {{have met}} us {{in front of the}} railway station at nine o'clock and, of course, he has no idea where to find us. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there.</b> Very likely the poor fellow is waiting still." ...|$|E
500|$|Jane Suuto was {{the joint}} oldest person to {{represent}} Uganda at the London Games {{at the age}} of 33. She had not entered any previous Summer Olympics. Sutto qualified for the Games because she achieved a third-place finish at the 2012 Riga Marathon with a time of two hours, 42 minutes and seven seconds, that met the [...] "B" [...] qualifying standard for her event, the women's marathon. In an interview with New Vision before she competed Suuto said: [...] "I will not promise a medal but <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> out <b>there</b> to offer my best and whatever God offers me. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> take it with both hands. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> out <b>there</b> and fight." [...] In the event held on 5 August, she finished 93rd out of 107 athletes, with a time of two hours, 44 minutes and 46 seconds. Suuto ranked ahead of Yolimar Pineda of Venezuela (two hours, 45 minutes and 16 seconds) and Anikó Kálovics from Hungary (two hours, 45 minutes and 55 seconds) but was behind Kálovics's fellow countrywoman Zsófia Erdélyi (two hours, 44 minutes and 45 seconds). Suuto finished 21 minutes and 39 seconds behind event winner Tiki Gelana of Ethiopia (two hours, 23 minutes and seven seconds).|$|R
6000|$|... "Ask Hugh Stanbury what {{he thinks}} of her. But don't suppose I want to say a word against her. I wouldn't for the world do such a thing. Only, as we've met there and all that, I thought it best {{to let you know that}} she had treated me in such a way, and has been {{altogether}} so violent, that <b>I</b> never <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> again." [...] So saying, Mr. Gibson passed on, and was of opinion that he had spoken with great generosity of the old woman who had treated him so badly.|$|R
6000|$|... "Friends in far France? And what {{friends have}} I here?--Art thou my friend? In thy secret heart dost thou wish me well? And for thee, Pierre, what am I but a vile clog to thee; {{dragging}} thee back from all thy felicity? Yes, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> yonder--yonder; out <b>there!</b> <b>I</b> <b>will,</b> <b>I</b> <b>will!</b> Unhand me! Let me plunge!" ...|$|R
60|$|Yours received. Thanks {{for your}} caution, but I {{have already been}} to Petersburg. Staid with General Grant {{an hour and a}} half and {{returned}} here. It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> to-morrow. I will take care of myself.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Tony, {{they would}} {{probably}} take you for a runaway. No, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go.</b> <b>There</b> can be no danger. The men are all away, and the women are sure to be loyal. I fancy the few who were the other way before will have changed their minds since the Yanks landed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think," [...] {{he whispered}} to Miss Pross, after anxious consideration, [...] "I think we had best not speak to him just now, or at all disturb him. I must look in at Tellson's; so <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> at once and come back presently. Then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine there, and all will be well." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he cried. [...] "You {{must not}} take these away. You must {{not think of}} it. They are of no use to you. Leave me the sheets, just as they are. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> further back. <b>There</b> are several words at the meaning of which I have only guessed. Leave them {{with me for a}} few days, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> make you an exact translation." ...|$|R
5000|$|During Sundays in the summer, Marilla would {{accompany}} {{her father to}} the family farm to perform practical activities. This demonstrated an explicit rejection {{of the values of}} her mother's church concerning the Sabbath. At the age of ten, she later wrote, Marilla attended a [...] "fiery" [...] Baptist sermon about hell, after which she swore that she would never believe in God again: [...] "Do you wonder that I, a child of ten years, said to my father, who was a freethinker, infidel, atheist, or whatever else you please to call him: 'I hate my mother's church. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not <b>go</b> <b>there</b> again.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think not. As far as I {{can judge}} he {{is a good}} boy still. I make him my escort to church, so that I am sure of him there. Renville would have taken him for a boy about his studio, and <b>I</b> think he <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> eventually; but Camilla thinks he may be an {{attraction}} at the bazaar, and is making him draw for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I will myself {{draw the}} money from the paymaster. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> at once. Send a couple of men with me, for of course it will be paid in silver. Then I will go to the quartermaster's stores, and get the carts ready by the time that the men arrive. I want to march in an hour's time, at latest." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> {{and take}} away some hay in payment of his debt,' said the liar. And {{proceeding}} to the hay-loft, he began to toss about the hay with a pitch-fork, prodding it into the trusses of hay, till, in terror of his life, the thief crept out and promised his partner to pay him the three florins on the following Saturday.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sahib; {{it will be}} {{perfectly}} safe {{for you to go}} about just as you are, and I can get you any other disguise you like. You will gather what is said in the town, can listen to the Sepoys, and examine the Subada Ke Kothee. If you like <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> with you now. My daughter shall come with us; she may be useful, and will be glad to be doing something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Had Father Nevin {{trusted to}} my honor, I {{would not have}} run away; but he locked me in, like a monk in a cell, and that <b>I</b> <b>will</b> not bear. Just one hour, Yvonne, one little hour of freedom, then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> back, else <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be no sport for me to-morrow," [...] said the lad, {{recklessly}} pulling up the bluets that starred the grass about him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is that it?' he said, {{speaking}} rapidly. 'Let me {{tell you}} then, my girl, that you shall have nothing but your earnings,--your fair earnings. Don't you take trouble about that. Urmand and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> settle that between us, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> bail <b>there</b> shall be no unpleasant words. As I said before, my girl sha'n't leave my house empty-handed; but, Lord bless you, he would only be too happy to take you in your petticoat, just as you are. I never saw a fellow more {{in love with a}} girl. Come, Marie, you need not mind saying the word to me, though you could not bring yourself to say it to him.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! yes, I forgot he {{was going}} to be married,' said Lady Bellair. 'Well, then, it must be Lord Fitzwarrene. Besides, Captain Armine is not rich, but he has got a very fine place though, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> and stop <b>there</b> some day. And, besides, he is over head-and-ears in debt, so they say. However, he is going to marry a very rich woman, and so all <b>will</b> be right. <b>I</b> like old {{families}} in decay to get round again.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there,</b> and we'll {{get some}} of the big monkeys, and you will make them small--just three inches high--by means of your magic, and we'll put the little monkeys all in a basket and bring them home with us. Then you'll train them to dance--up here in your room, where no one can see them--and on Ozma's {{birthday}} we'll put 'em into the cake and they'll know by that time just what to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like enough {{he is at}} {{the club}} still, my lady. At any rate, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> {{in the first place and}} find out. There is sure to be a crowd about the gates {{listening}} to the music--they have got a band over from Newport--so that if they do not know anything at the club, there are sure to be some people outside who saw the accident, and will know where the Major was taken. Anyhow, I won't come back without news." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a duty we all owe to {{the poor}} {{creature}} herself to trace her," [...] continued Sir Percival. [...] "She may have said something at Todd's Corner which may help us to find her. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> and make inquiries on the chance. In the meantime, as I cannot prevail on myself to discuss this painful subject with Miss Fairlie, may I beg, Miss Halcombe, that you will kindly undertake {{to give her the}} necessary explanation, deferring it of course until you have received the reply to that note." ...|$|E
5000|$|Harding's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:Served as {{captain of}} the forecastle on board the U.S.S. Dacotah {{on the occasion of}} the destruction of the blockade runner Pevensey, near Beauford, N.C., 9 June 1864. [...] "Learning that one of the officers in the boat, which was in danger of being, and subsequently was, swamped, could not swim, Harding remarked to him: 'If we are swamped, sir, I shall carry you to the beach or <b>I</b> <b>will</b> never <b>go</b> <b>there</b> myself.' He did not succeed in carrying out his promise, but made desperate efforts to do so, while others thought only of themselves. Such conduct is worthy of appreciation and admiration--a sailor risking his own life to save that of an officer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "With your permission, sir, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> over <b>there</b> at once, and ask Colonel Lewis {{that she}} may receive {{specially}} good treatment. She has been extremely kind to me, {{and it is to}} her influence over Mahmud that I owe my life. Up to this morning Mahmud would have spared me, but Osman Digna insisted that I should be killed, and he was obliged to give way. They fastened me to a tree behind the trench, just inside the zareba, and I should certainly have been killed by our own musketry fire, had not my boy, who had come into the camp in disguise, cut my cords. I fell as if shot, and he threw himself down on me; until the Camerons burst in, when I at once joined them, and did what little I could in the fight." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{that makes}} you pale," [...] said Clewe. [...] "Are you afraid that if I begin work with the Artesian ray I shall become so {{interested}} in it that I shall forget our friends {{up there in the}} North? There is no danger. No matter what I might be doing with the ray, I can disconnect the batteries in an instant, lock up the lens-house, and in the next half-hour start for St. John's. Then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> North if <b>there</b> is anything needed to be done there which human beings can do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be best," [...] Harry said, [...] "if {{you will}} do it, Marie. I own that I am in a fever of apprehension. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> <b>there</b> at once {{to tell them that}} all must be in {{readiness}} by to-night.

They will be able to leave you with a better heart if they feel that your stay here is likely to bring health to him and happiness to both of you." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{was asleep}} as Christmas struck upon the clock at mid night, and didn't wake again till two hours ago. It is now half past 10 Xmas morning; I have had my coffee and bread, and shan't {{get out of}} bed till it is time to dress for Mrs. Laflan's Christmas dinner this evening--where I shall meet Bram Stoker and must make sure about that photo with Irving's autograph.

It does not matter to me where I am. I felt so before, and of course I feel it all the more now that you have saved my life. I am quite sure you will get on in the world, Will, and sha’n’t grudge you your success a bit, however high you rise, for I know how hard you have worked, and how well you deserve it. Besides, even if I had had the pains bestowed upon me, and had worked ever so hard myself, I should never have been a bit like you. You seem different from us somehow. I don’t know how it is, but you are smarter and quicker and more active. I expect some day you will find out something about your father, and then probably we shall be able to understand the difference between us. At any rate I am quite prepared to see you rise, and I shall be well content if you will always allow me to remain your friend.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{a little}} house in Silesia, where I am still a great lady, half-a-dozen servants, perhaps, farms which bring in a trifle of money. <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> and live <b>there.</b> <b>I</b> think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> {{get up in the}} mornings as Jeanne does, and try to love my mountains, and go about amongst my people, and try to spell life with {{different}} letters. Come with me, Nigel. There is shooting and fishing there, and horses wild enough for even you to find pleasure in riding. We have tried many things in life. Let us make one last throw, and try the land of Arcady." ...|$|R
5000|$|In December 1976, Czezowski, Carrington and Jones {{organised}} three gigs at the Roxy. They {{financed the}} venture with borrowed money (Jones, a musician, pawned his guitar to stock the bars, and hire sound equipment, etc.). The first show, on 14 December, was Generation X, a band Czezowski managed. The {{second on the}} following night was the Heartbreakers. The third, on 21 December, featured Siouxsie and the Banshees and Generation X. However, it was the Clash and the Heartbreakers that headlined the official gala opening on 1 January 1977 which was filmed by Julien Temple and finally screened on BBC Four on 1 January 2015 as The Clash: New Year's Day '77. The {{only thing that could}} count as a [...] "scene" [...] is the Roxy. And the Roxy is a dormitory. The last time I went I was feeling really uppity. I stood in the middle and looked around and all these people were slumped around dozing! I threw tomato sauce on the mirror and stormed out. And I haven't been back there. I don't think <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>go</b> back <b>there.</b> The sooner it closes the better. —Joe Strummer Don Letts was the resident DJ at the club and he was instrumental in encouraging punk rockers to embrace reggae.|$|R
5000|$|The second tournament {{was held}} at the Telewest Arena in Newcastle in September 2008, and {{involved}} Sam Sexton, Pele Reid, Luke Simpkin, Dave Ferguson, Chris Burton, David Ingleby, Lee Swaby and Darren Morgan. The draw for the first round of fights was made by reigning British champion Danny Williams. Speaking before the tournament, competitor Luke Simpkin said [...] "This could change my life if I win it", initially a substitute he was brought in to replace Ian Millarvie who had sustained an injury. Of his tactics for the tournament Simpkin said [...] "There’s no tactics involved in my game and attack is the best form of defence so <b>I</b> <b>will</b> just attack. You haven’t got much time to plan anything so <b>I</b> <b>will</b> just <b>go</b> out <b>there,</b> have a good time and try my best". [...] "At 24-years-old I still haven't got my man strength as yet, and I know I can keep improving, hopefully next year I can get a shot at British title, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> keep getting stronger and stronger."
