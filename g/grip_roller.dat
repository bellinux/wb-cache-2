50|$|It {{is alleged}} that Highs knew the jenny's limitations. It could produce only thread that was {{suitable}} for weft. Its output was too soft {{to be used}} for warp, which still had to be manufactured from linen. While Hargreaves worked on the spinning jenny, Highs, it is alleged, constructed a machine using rollers, similar to a machine later called the water frame. Whereas the jenny had stretched the thread by trapping it in a clove, a sort of wooden vice and pulling it out, the water frame achieved better results by passing the roving through two sets of <b>gripping</b> <b>rollers.</b> The second set were rotating at five times the speed of the first, so the thread was stretched to exactly five times its original length, before being given its vital twist by a bobbin and flyer. The machine produced stronger thread than the jenny. This thread that was suitable for warp. It is alleged that Highs gave clockmaker Kay a wooden model of his rollers and asked him to make a working metal version. Kay did so before returning to live a few miles away in his native Warrington.|$|R

50|$|Large woodchippers {{frequently}} {{are equipped with}} grooved rollers in the throat of their feed funnels. Once a branch has been <b>gripped</b> by the <b>rollers,</b> the rollers transport the branch to the chipping blades at a steady rate. These rollers are a safety feature and are generally reversible for situations where a branch gets caught on clothing.|$|R

On a conveying medium (1), support arms (2) are arranged horizontally and vertically to its travel direction, said support arms (2) forming a pair of support arms (3) to support the wheels of a motor vehicle axle. Each pair of support arms (3) is provided with support rollers mounted in swivel bearings (5), said <b>rollers</b> <b>gripping</b> the wheel tyres (8) by a horizontal {{movement of the support}} arms (2) of a support arm pair (3) in opposite directions...|$|R
30|$|Tensile {{tests were}} {{performed}} on dumbbell-shaped specimens according to ASTM D 412 using a Testometric testing machine (Testometric Co., Rochdale, Lancashire, UK) with a load cell of 5 kN and self-tightening <b>roller</b> <b>grips.</b> The specimens were stamped out from nanocomposite foam samples. The narrow section of the dumbbell-shaped specimens had dimensions of 20 [*]×[*] 4 [*]×[*] 2 mm 3, respectively. Test specimens were prepared from foam panels in the flow direction (thickness was in the foam rise direction). In order to remove skins from the specimens' surfaces we used chipper. Five specimens per sample were tested. The tests were run at a speed of 500 mm min- 1.|$|R
50|$|A burster is {{a machine}} that {{separates}} one-part continuous form paper into separate, individual, sheets along the transverse perforations. A burster was typically used with printed continuous form paper applications such as mass-mail advertising, invoices, and account statements. Bursting is done by firmly gripping the second-to-last sheet while feed <b>rollers</b> <b>grip</b> the last sheet firmly and pull it away to burst the perforation. The continuous form paper then advances into the feed rollers to burst the next sheet. Bursting is often a high-speed process that allows the continuous form paper to feed in at a steady rate, with burst pages either stacked or fed into a single-sheet conveyance to the next paper processing stage. Burster equipment and paper manufactures had to generate perforation specifications so that the paper perforations reliably separated under the force of pulling the sheets apart and not tear down into the printed part of the sheet.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Measurement of the tensile {{properties}} of high strength woven and knit fabrics, including geotextiles and geogrids traditionally {{make use of}} roller grip-type clamping systems. These grips are designed to allow a sample to be pulled in tension without applying an excessive crimping or compressive force on the specimen. thus avoiding premature failure. <b>Roller</b> <b>grips.</b> also known as capstan grips, also have the ad-vantage of allowing the specimen to aIign itself with the applied force therefore loading the specimen uniformly across the width. Howevcr, since the specimen tightens itself around the grip during testing, crosshead travel cannot be used to measure specimen strain, which makes the determination of low strain properties and the selection of modulus values difficult. Two issues {{that must be addressed}} in obtaining low strain properties are how to measure sample strain and how to get an accurate and repeatable starting point for the test. This paper will explore alternate methods of gripping systems, strain measurement and data analysis with the objective of accurately measuring and re-porting low strain properties of woven and knit textiles. *Author to whom correspondence should be addressed...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRoller skis {{are used}} by {{cross-country}} skiers for snow-free training, {{with the aim of}} imitating skiing on snow. The roller skis on the market that are constructed for use in the classical style are equipped with a front and a back wheel, one of which has a ratchet to enable it to grip the surface when diagonal striding and kick double poling. A new type of roller ski was constructed with a function which makes it necessary to use the same kick technique as that used on snow, i. e. the ski has a camber that must be pushed down to obtain grip. Its stiffness can be adjusted based on factors that influence grip, i. e. the skier's bodyweight and technical skiing skills. Thus, our aim was to make comparative measurements as regards <b>grip</b> between ratcheted <b>roller</b> skis and the roller ski with a camber and compare with previous published results for grip waxed skis during cross-country skiing on snow. The measurements were carried out using specially developed equipment, with a bottom plate and an overlying rubber mat of the same type as used on many treadmills and a function for applying different loads and generating traction {{on the back of the}} roller ski...|$|R
25|$|In the French comb the {{slivers of}} wool are fed forward by ratchet-operated rollers and a pinned feed grid, the leading {{end of the}} fibres being pushed beyond the nipper jaws which open and shut to receive and hold them, leaving a fringe of fibres {{protruding}} through which the pins of the revolving cylinder comb pass, removing the short fibres or noil and any impurities. These are carried round to the underside and deposited in a box for removal. Whilst the above initial combing is taking place the drawing-off rollers, mounted on a carriage, move towards the nipper jaws and grip the fringe of fibres {{as soon as the}} last row of pins on the comb cylinder has passed through the fringe projecting from the nipper jaws. As the drawing-off <b>rollers</b> <b>grip</b> the projecting fringe, the intersector comb descends, piercing the fringe of fibres, the nipper jaws open and the fibres are given their second combing by the rotation and recession of the drawing-off rollers pulling the fibres through the pins of the intersector comb and the pins of the feed grid. The combed fibres are then conveyed by the leather apron of the drawing-off rollers to the front rollers of the carriage, down a funnel and through the calender rollers, into a can placed directly underneath.|$|R
