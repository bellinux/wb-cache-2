40|$|ABSTRACT: In base-isolated {{structures}} {{specially designed}} <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> pro-vide the needed flexibility and energy dissipation capacity. The <b>isolation</b> <b>systems,</b> {{which can be}} either elastomeric or sliding systems, exhibit highly nonlinear be-havior. The existing algorithms cannot analyze base-isolated structures with sliding <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> accurately. This paper presents an analytical model and a solution algorithm developed for nonlinear dynamic analysis of three-dimensional-base-isolated structures with elastomeric and/or sliding <b>isolation</b> <b>systems.</b> The novelty of the analytical model and solution algorithm is its capability to capture the highly nonlinear frictional behavior of sliding <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> in plane motion. Nonlin-ear behavior is restricted to the base and the superstructure {{is considered to be}} elastic at all times. Biaxial and uniaxial models, which can represent both elas-tomeric and sliding isolation bearings, are presented. The solution algorithm con-sisting of the pseudoforce method with iteration is presented. Comparison of com-puted results with experimental results is presented for verification. A six-story-reinforced-concrete-base-isolated structure is analyzed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effectiveness}} {{and limitations of}} seismic isolation for the earthquake protection of a cable-stayed bridge under bi-directional seismic actions. A simplified lumped mass finite element model of the Quincy Bay-view Bridge at Illinois is developed for the investigation. The deck of the bridge is isolated from the towers by using elastomeric and sliding <b>isolation</b> <b>systems.</b> For the non-linear <b>isolation</b> <b>systems,</b> {{the interaction between the}} restoring forces in two orthogonal horizontal directions is duly considered in the response analysis. The seismic response of the bridge is obtained by solving the governing equations of motion in the incremental form using an iterative step-by-step method. A parametric study is also performed by varying important parameters of the <b>isolation</b> <b>systems.</b> The seismic response of the isolated cable-stayed bridge is compared with the corresponding response of the bridge without <b>isolation</b> <b>systems.</b> The results of the investigation indicate that the peak base shear response of the towers and deck accelerations are significantly reduced by the isolation. The displacement response of the hysteretic <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> is found to be increased when the bi-directional interaction of the bearing force is considered in the response analysis. Furthermore, it is also found that the response of the bridge is significantly affected by the variation in the parameters of the <b>isolation</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

2500|$|There are {{a number}} of columns {{supporting}} the structure. As the ground level rises from the shore {{to the level of the}} Yerba Buena Tunnel, the height of the above ground portion of the columns varies. Since the rock structure supporting these is a hard shale, it would be normal under previous engineering methods to simply dig a relatively shallow foundation for each column, with the structural length varying progressively. Modern seismic analysis and computer simulations revealed the problem with such a design; while the long columns could flex several feet at the top (0.6 meter, more or less), the shorter columns were likely to break, since the rigid deck structures cause the imposition of a similar amount of motion at the tops of the columns, imposing more bending stress per unit length on the shorter columns. This problem was solved by making the columns of similar (but not uniform) length, with the [...] "shorter" [...] columns extending in permanent open shafts to deep foundations. This allows all columns of the YBITS to respond in a sufficiently uniform manner. The space between a column and its pit is covered by a protective sacrificial cover, forming a type of base <b>isolation</b> <b>system</b> at the more sensitive column locations. In addition, the western landing of the YBITS is a zero moment hinge, and so there are no vertical bending stresses at that point.|$|E

40|$|The work {{reported}} herein {{focuses on}} {{the evaluation of the}} response of seismic isolated buildings. An introduction to the seismic isolation concept is presented and a reference to its historical evolution is made. Some of the specific problems regarding the detailing and execution of isolated buildings are examined. A description of the most important examples of <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> with reference to their behavior model is presented. The behavior of the <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> when installed in buildings subjected to seismic loading is examined, assessing the influence of the different parameters that characterize the <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> models. The numerical evaluation of the response of the isolated building models allows the selection of the proper characteristics of the <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> according to prescrible objectives. First, just the linear behavior is admited for the structures, but later the possibility of structural non-linear behavior is also considered. In the analysis of the isolated buildings assuming structural non-linear response, it is shown under which conditions it is possible to consider this kind of behavior, and which characteristics should the <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> exhibit to optimize the response in terms of displacements, internal stresses and ductility requirements.

The base <b>isolation</b> <b>systems</b> have been designed in compliance to the European seismic codes EC 2 and EC 8.

A dynamic nonlinear analysis is performed for the three-dimensional base isolated structure. Recorded accelerograms for bi-directional ground motions compatible with the reference elastic response spectrum have been used for the evaluation of the seismic response of the structure.

During an accident where radioactive material may be released, these valves must shut to prevent the release of radioactive material or the loss of reactor coolant.
