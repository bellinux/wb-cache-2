[...] "It's getting better, and progress is above all what is hoped for", Martínez told the Associated Press. [...] "To go back, I have to recover, I have to be healthy. But if God doesn't want that, then I would have to think about giving it all up." [...] Martínez added, [...] "It's going to be a bitter winter because I am going to <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of work. The pain I feel {{was one of the worst}} I have felt with any injury in my career." [...] But by December 30, 2006, Martínez was more optimistic: [...] "The progress has been excellent. I don't have problems anymore with my reach or flexibility, and so far everything is going very well. The problem has to do with the calcification of the bone that was broken with the tear, and that had to be operated on. You have to let it run its course." [...] Martínez also reported bulking up as part of his recuperative regimen: [...] "I've put on about 10 pounds of muscle, because that's one of our strategies." ...|$|E

'Why don't you pull him in?' says I. 'And break my rod an' line?' says he. 'Why don't you have a stronger line and pole?' says I. 'There wouldn't be no science in that,' says he. 'If it's your science you want to show off,' says I, 'you ought to fish for mud eels. There's more game in 'em than there is in any other fish round here, and as they're mighty lively out of water you might play one of 'em fur half an hour after you got him on shore, and it would take all your science to keep him from reelin' up his end of the line faster than you could yourn.'" ...|$|E

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette's Rob Owen also praised Delany and the supporting cast, but he commented that upon watching the episode for the first time, he thought Megan Hunt was [...] "a fairly unsympathetic, cold character." [...] He added [...] "Body of Proof seems less likely to drive viewers away, at least not viewers content with whodunit crime procedurals.

5000|$|.....without {{a guitar}} player you can't {{rely on the}} {{standard}} hooks that punk rock and rock n' roll in general relies on. The guitar player - the guitar god quote unquote - was such a focus {{for so long that}} by the nature of not having a guitar player, the bass and the drums <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> more. It also makes the vocals more important, or at least it makes a lot more room for the vocals. You don't have guitar solos, you don't have the wash of high end. And the things you do on the drums are different, if you just did a straight four beat on the drums it would get kinda dull after awhile. It isn't as though bass guitar hasn't been a prominent instrument at times in other bands but it made us approach things differently, our song structure couldn't just be verse-chorus-verse. It had everything to do with how our sound got off to a unique start.|$|E

50|$|At {{the core}} of {{teaching}} at HSE {{there are two basic}} principles. The first principle is the individual work of a student. One of the key HSE goals is to educate a highly qualified professional with independent thinking, able to conduct the necessary research and to make conclusions himself. To achieve this HSE students <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of independent work, individually or in groups, while the tutors only guide and consult them. The second core principle of teaching at HSE is control. The academic year, beginning in September and ending in June, is divided into four terms (modules). At the end of every module the students have to pass exams. Most of the exams in HSE are in written form and often include both multiple choice test questions and problems for which written solutions are to be provided. In addition, there is a special emphasis on written analytical works of varying importance and volume. Students have to write one or two essays during most courses. Class participation (speeches, presentations and general participation in discussions) often {{plays an important role in}} defining the final grade for the course.|$|E
