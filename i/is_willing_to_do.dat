5|$|Margaery Tyrell {{is brought}} to meet the High Sparrow, who warns her {{to stay away from}} her life of riches and sin, and recounts his past of how, as a proud cobbler, he learned his wealth-guided pursuits were lies and that the shoeless poor were closer to the truth than anyone. He then takes Margaery to see Loras, who is {{breaking}} under the Sparrows' torture, and <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything to make it stop. Margaery realises that the High Sparrow is trying to use Loras to break her, and tells him to remain strong.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Jaime {{talks with}} Edmure Tully, {{trying to win}} his {{cooperation}} by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he has never seen, and offering to send {{him and his family}} to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.|$|E

25|$|The recent Sino-Angolan {{association}} is illustrative. When a petroleum-rich area called for investment and rebuilding, China advanced a $5 billion loan to be repaid in oil. They sent Chinese technicians, fixing {{a large part}} of the electrical system, and leading a part of the reconstruction. In the short term Angola benefits from Chinese-built roads, hospitals, schools, hotels, football stadiums, shopping centers and telecommunications projects. In turn, Angola mortgaged future oil production of a valuable, non-renewable resource. It may turn out to be a costly trade for Angola, but their needs for infrastructure is immediate and that is precisely what China provideds when no one else <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. And thusly, Angola has become China's leading energy supplier.|$|E
25|$|Yasuna's {{character}} changes {{between the}} manga and anime {{in regard to}} her level of devotion towards Hazumu and how much she <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to be with her, especially after Hazumu's transformation into a girl. The first instance of this is when Yasuna confesses her love to Hazumu the first day she returns to school as a girl, but in the anime she does not confess to Hazumu after the change and in fact starts to avoid her. Similarly, during the time when Hazumu is shopping for her first bra, Yasuna {{shows up in the}} manga version and helps Hazumu into a very feminine bra, but in the anime it is Tomari who helps her try on her first bra. In episode three of the anime, Yasuna continues to avoid Hazumu despite still longing for her, and it takes an effort by Hazumu to restore their previous friendship, but Yasuna never once tries to avoid Hazumu in the manga; on the contrary, Yasuna tries to be around Hazumu as much as possible in the manga version. During the time when Yasuna holds a curry party in the manga, which is combined with the beach trip in episode seven of the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she wants all of Hazumu to herself and she invited the others to the party so that she could see Hazumu's brightest smile. However, during the same scene in the anime, Yasuna tells Tomari that she invited Tomari and the others so that she could learn more about Hazumu and her likes and dislikes.|$|E

She {{was just trying to}} adjust her mind and heart to the inevitability, even though she was only making things worse." [...] Despite her crime, Case also described Sharon as a victim, and contended that this was not the worst thing Sharon has done. After losing Christian to Nick, Sharon decides to fight for a place in his life. CBS Soaps In Depth wrote that her frustration over no one willing to understand her [...] "is what finally lights a tiny flame of defiance deep inside Sharon". According to Case, [...] "Sharon <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything for her child. She's fighting for what she believes is right." ...|$|E

Daffy attempts to recreate the opening with himself in place of Bugs Bunny, but the shield overshoots, causing the entire title card to fall apart. Daffy surrenders the stardom, claiming that since he won't star in the cartoon, they might as well just skip straight to the movie.

2500|$|Maxine McCarty Gray, {{played by}} Tyne Daly: She is Amy's widowed mother. A social worker for the Department of Children and Families, she had retired, but {{she returns to}} the job {{at the start of}} the series. She <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{whatever}} it takes to help the children in her care, even bending the law. She is an opinionated, strong-willed woman, very set in her ways, and capable of holding long grudges (she has not spoken to her brother in over 12 years), but loving to her family. Her relationship with daughter Amy is often not easy, since they are so much alike. After a troubled courtship, she becomes engaged to a wealthy businessman, Jared Duff, but he dies 48 hours before their wedding (a storyline twist necessitated by the unexpected death of the actor Richard Crenna, who played the character). She later becomes involved in a very complicated, on again off again relationship to her landscape designer Ignacio Messina. She has two heart attacks in the last season and has to undergo open heart surgery, but makes certain lifestyle changes and recovers well. At the end of the series she accepts Ignacio's marriage proposal and is set to retire again, becoming a foster parent to the last child she helped.|$|E

2500|$|A {{final twist}} in Steven's story was his {{involvement}} in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield). In episodes that aired in May 2008, {{it was revealed that}} Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, [...] "It’s all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian’s love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She’s the one who gets most of Ian’s time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He’s been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever it takes to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous." [...] In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An EastEnders source told Digital Spy: [...] "Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face." [...] Sidwell added, [...] "Steven is deadly! He <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> whatever it takes to get what he wants [...] including murder." [...] The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the Eurostar to Paris) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, [...] "Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to go home with Ian." [...] In Steven's final scenes, Ian rejects Steven as his son once again, telling him [...] "I never give up on my family. But you're not my family, are you? You're your mother's son and you're Simon's son, and that really used to hurt. Now I thank God I never produced anything as sick and twisted as you." [...] Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.|$|E
2500|$|Misao is a sixteen-year-old {{high school}} student. She {{has been plagued}} {{with the ability to}} see demons ever since birth. Because of her ability, she was never able to make any friends until she met Kyō. The monsters were {{harmless}} until her sixteenth birthday; on the day she turned sixteen, a monster possessing one of the schools idols attacks her. Before she was injured any further, Kyō came to save her and healed her wound by licking it. It is then that she discovers that he is a demon and that she is the [...] "bride of the prophecy" [...] for the head of the Tengu Clan; she was chosen to be the wife of the next head of the clan ten years ago. When she was a child, Misao became attached to Kyo and they had made a promise that she would be his bride. However, she was supposed to marry Kyo's older brother, Sho, who was the heir to the clan. As a result, Kyo left Misao's side in order to surpass him and become the heir. At first, she was scared of Kyo for his stoic personality and demonic powers, but grows to trust and understand that he <b>is</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything to be with her. She later falls in love with Kyo and decides to fulfill her promise to him by becoming his wife, once she graduates high school. They begin a romantic and sexual relationship from then on. After Sho's death, Misao notices a change in her powers, which no one is able to touch her and her scent is overwhelming. It is discovered that this is because Misao is pregnant with a demon child. Despite being told the baby could kill her during childbirth, she refuses to abort it because she has grown to love her unborn child. Misao gives birth to a boy whom she named Sou. Instead of dying, a miracle happens when Misao wakes up, and even though it costs her most of her ability to walk, she is able to live happily with Kyo and Sou.|$|E
