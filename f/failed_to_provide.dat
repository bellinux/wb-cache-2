5|$|Aloin, a {{compound}} {{found in the}} exudate of some Aloe species, was the common ingredient in over-the-counter (OTC) laxative products in the United States until 2002 when the Food and Drug Administration banned it because the companies manufacturing it <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the necessary safety data. Aloe vera has potential toxicity, with side effects occurring at some dose levels both when ingested or applied topically. Although toxicity may be less when aloin is removed by processing, Aloe vera that contains aloin in excess amounts may induce side effects.|$|E

5|$|Pedro Afonso's {{death from}} fever {{at the age}} of one devastated the Emperor, and the {{imperial}} couple had no further children. Pedro Afonso's older sister Dona Isabel became heiress, but PedroII was unconvinced that a woman could ever be accepted as monarch by the ruling elite. He excluded Isabel from matters of state and <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> training for her possible role as empress. With no surviving male children, the Emperor started to believe that the imperial line was destined to end with his own death.|$|E
5|$|Bruce paid two further {{visits to}} Spitsbergen, in 1912 and 1914, but the {{outbreak}} of war prevented further immediate developments. However, early in 1919 the old syndicate {{was replaced by a}} larger and better-financed company. Bruce had now fixed his main hopes on the discovery of oil, but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> evidence of its presence, although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered. Thereafter Bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement. The new company had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures, and although it continued to exist, under various ownerships, until 1952, there is no record of profitable extraction. Its assets and claims were finally acquired by a rival concern.|$|E
5|$|In March 1854, {{the steamer}} Black Warrior {{stopped at the}} Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a cargo manifest, Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress {{as a violation of}} American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the flames of Southern expansionism.|$|E

5|$|Moss was {{the founder}} and {{director}} of Moss Electrical Co Ltd, and owned 950 of the 1,000 available shares. In September 1986 he said that Hunter, the finance director, could have 50 of these shares as part of his employment. Crucially, he made no statement or trust involving the other 900 shares. This gift of 50 shares was never implemented because of tax concerns, the risks of a takeover, and mainly because Moss changed his mind. Hunter brought a case against Moss claiming his 50 shares, which rested on two issues. First, whether the language used was sufficient to create a trust, and second, whether or not the trust <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the three certainties {{because of the lack of}} segregation between the shares.|$|E
5|$|New Line {{believed}} Freddy vs. Jason {{needed a}} fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing Hodder {{was the best}} choice for the role. Hodder did receive the script for Freddy vs. Jason, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained he wanted a slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.|$|E

Hasselbaink negotiated {{a deal to}} work with a fictitious Far Eastern firm looking to become involved in the transfer of footballers. Additionally, Hasselbaink, despite the conflict of interest, was open to the idea of signing players represented by the firm. Queens Park Rangers launched an internal investigation and went on to release a statement fully backing Hasselbaink and stated that The Daily Telegraph <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> sufficient evidence regarding their sting operation.|$|E

5|$|Recent historians, however, {{have taken}} a more {{complicated}} view of Elizabeth. Her reign is famous for {{the defeat of the}} Armada, and for successful raids against the Spanish, such as those on Cádiz in 1587 and 1596, but some historians point to military failures on land and at sea. In Ireland, Elizabeth's forces ultimately prevailed, but their tactics stain her record. Rather than as a brave defender of the Protestant nations against Spain and the Habsburgs, she is more often regarded as cautious in her foreign policies. She offered very limited aid to foreign Protestants and <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> her commanders with the funds to make a difference abroad.|$|E
5|$|The Tube Alloys {{programme}} in Britain and Canada was {{the first}} nuclear weapons project. Due to the high costs, {{and the fact that}} Britain was fighting a war within bombing range of its enemies, Tube Alloys was ultimately subsumed into the Manhattan Project. Despite reaching an agreement with the United States to share nuclear weapons technology, and to refrain from using it against each other, or against other countries without mutual consent, the United States <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> complete details {{of the results of the}} Manhattan Project to the United Kingdom. The Soviet Union gained valuable information through its atomic spies, who had infiltrated both the British and American projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{ships were}} {{modified}} extensively {{in an attempt}} to rectify their machinery problems. All three ships had their propeller shafts lengthened, and their original bronze screws were replaced with larger steel propellers, though this did not improve performance. Sebenico received the most radical alteration; her stern was lengthened slightly to allow for finer hull lines, which would improve her hydrodynamic shape, though this too <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a significantly higher speed. As a result of her different hull, Sebenico is sometimes not included in the Zara class. Between 1898 and 1901, all four ships were re-boilered.|$|E

5|$|Timex {{produced}} a second {{version of the}} ZX81 {{in the form of}} the TS1500, essentially an Americanised ZX81 launched in August 1983. It dispensed with the membrane keyboard and used a case similar to that of the ZX Spectrum, incorporating 16 KB of on-board memory. It was effectively a stopgap between the ZX81 and Spectrum. However, it was unsuccessful due to increased competition from rival US machines and the after-effects of Timex's botched marketing of the TS1000. Although the TS1000 had initially been a great success, Timex <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the essential RAM pack upgrades to the market for two or three months after it launched the TS1000. Consumers would take the machine home, plug it in and find that it would not do anything useful due to the lack of memory.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time castles were {{becoming}} tourist attractions for the first time. By the 1740s Windsor Castle had become an early tourist attraction; wealthier visitors who could afford to pay the castle keeper could enter, see curiosities such as the castle's narwhal horn, and by the 1750s buy the first guidebooks. The first guidebook to Kenilworth Castle followed in 1777 with many later editions following in the coming decades. By the 1780s and 1790s visitors were beginning to progress as far as Chepstow, where an attractive female guide escorted tourists around the ruins {{as part of the}} popular Wye Tour. In Scotland Blair Castle became a popular attraction on account of its landscaped gardens, as did Stirling Castle with its romantic connections. Caernarfon in North Wales appealed to many visitors, especially artists. Irish castles proved less popular, partially because contemporary tourists regarded the country as being somewhat backward and the ruins therefore <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> the necessary romantic contrast with modern life.|$|E
5|$|In 429 BC, Perdiccas II sent {{aid to the}} Spartan {{commander}} Cnemus in Acarnania, but the Macedonian forces arrived {{too late}} to enter the Battle of Naupactus, which ended in an Athenian victory. In that same year, Sitalces, according to Thucydides, invaded Macedonia {{at the behest of}} Athens to aid them in subduing Chalcidice and to punish Perdiccas II for violating the terms of their peace treaty. However, given Sitalces' huge Thracian invading force (allegedly 150,000 soldiers) and a nephew of Perdiccas II that he intended to place on the Macedonian throne after toppling the latter's regime, Athens must have become wary of acting on their supposed alliance since they <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> him with promised naval support. Sitalces eventually retreated from Macedonia, perhaps due to logistical concerns: a shortage of provisions and harsh winter conditions.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Ocean {{had been}} an {{important}} strategic region for British trade since the first British trading posts were developed in India. By the Napoleonic Wars, millions of pounds worth of goods crossed the ocean's trade routes every year, mostly in the heavily guarded convoys of East Indiamen. The French recognised the economic importance of these convoys but until 1808 <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> sufficient forces to disrupt the Indian trade. Late in 1808, {{it was decided to}} send a strong frigate squadron to the Ocean under the command of Jacques Hamelin to augment the forces available on the island bases of Île Bonaparte and Isle de France and raid British shipping in the region. Hamelin was an able commander and between May 1809 and July 1810 his ships captured seven East Indiamen and a large number of small merchant ships and warships.|$|E
5|$|The jury deliberated for 23hours. On June 2, 1997, McVeigh {{was found}} guilty on 11counts of murder and conspiracy. Although the defense argued for a reduced {{sentence}} of life imprisonment, McVeigh was sentenced to death. In May 2001, the Justice Department announced that the FBI had mistakenly <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> over 3,000documents to McVeigh's defense counsel. The Justice Department also announced that the execution would be postponed for one month for the defense to review the documents. On June 6, federal judge Richard Paul Matsch ruled the documents would not prove McVeigh innocent and ordered the execution to proceed. After President George W. Bush approved the execution (McVeigh was a federal inmate and federal law dictates that the President must approve the execution of federal prisoners), he was executed by lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute in Terre Haute, Indiana, on June 11. The execution was transmitted on closed-circuit television so that the relatives of the victims could witness his death. McVeigh's execution was the first federal execution in 38years.|$|E
5|$|The {{perpetrators}} were apprehended in 1989 {{under the}} administration of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. Moro and Zorrilla were sentenced to 25 and 35 years in prison respectively, but were released from prison in February 2009 for good conduct after serving {{at least half of}} their sentences. Several public intellectuals, journalists, press freedom organizations, newspapers, and politicians protested their releases. Zorrilla returned to prison later that year after he <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> a formal letter petitioning his release. On 10 September 2013, Zorrilla was released from prison after a Mexico City judge granted him the opportunity to fulfill the remaining years of his sentence at his residence due to unstable health conditions. The Mexican government closed the case after the arrests, but many journalists doubted the results of the investigation and believed that the masterminds behind the murder case remained at large.|$|E
