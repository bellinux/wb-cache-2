50|$|The 2,200 square {{kilometres}} Bouba Njida National Park (Parc National de Bouba Ndjida) is {{southeast of}} Garoua on the Chad border. Cameroon created {{the park in}} 1968 to protect the black rhinoceros and <b>Derby</b> <b>eland.</b> Many experts today say that the rhinoceros is now extinct in the area today. Other animals in the park include buffalo, elephants, giraffes, leopards, lions, and hippopotami.|$|E
50|$|A major {{conservation}} {{effort has}} been launched with funding provided by the Global Environmental Facility (under {{the aegis of the}} UNDP) to be completed by 2014 with the objective of substantially increasing the area under protection estate and reinforce the management instruments to achieve effective protection area, particularly the southwest region in respect of endangered mammal species of <b>Derby</b> <b>eland</b> and the western chimpanzee.|$|E
50|$|The giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus), {{also known}} as the Lord <b>Derby</b> <b>eland,</b> is an open-forest and savanna antelope. A species of the family Bovidae and genus Taurotragus, it was {{described}} in 1847 by John Edward Gray. The giant eland is the largest species of antelope, with a body length ranging from 220 - 290 cm. There are two subspecies: T. d. derbianus and T. d. gigas.|$|E
5000|$|The Wildlife Safari Park sits in {{the middle}} of 8 km2 (3.09 sq. miles) of unspoiled savanna bush, about 4 km from Jos. It offers a wide variety of wild animals within easy viewing. These include buffalos, lions, leopards, baboons, monkeys, <b>derby</b> <b>elands,</b> pythons, crocodiles, chimpanzees, jackals and the rare pygmy hippopotamus, which is being {{successfully}} bred in the 'hippo pool’. The park also boasts great, panoramic views of Jos city.|$|R
50|$|A Senegalese {{study focused}} on the {{suckling}} behaviour of giant eland and common eland calves about one to five months old determined that suckling bouts increased with {{the age of the}} calves. No other change occurred in the farmed common eland calves, but in the giant eland calves, the males were found to suckle more than female ones and shorter suckling bouts were marked in primiparous mothers than multiparous ones. The results suggest that <b>Derby</b> <b>elands</b> that lived in their natural habitat adjusted their maternal behaviour so as to be able to readily maintain a vigilant lookout for predators and other similar risks. In contrast, the farmed common elands behaved as in the conditions of captivity, without predators.|$|R
40|$|Camera {{trapping}} with capture-recapture analyses {{has provided}} {{estimates of the}} abundances of elusive species {{over the last two}} decades. Closed capture-recapture models (CR) based on the recognition of individuals and incorporating natural heterogeneity in capture probabilities are considered robust tools; however, closure assumption is often questionable and the use of an Mh jackknife estimator may fail in estimations of real abundance when the heterogeneity is high and data is sparse. A novel, spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) approach based on the location-specific capture histories of individuals overcomes the limitations of closed models. We applied both methods on a closed population of 16 critically endangered Western <b>Derby</b> <b>elands</b> in the fenced 1, 060 -ha Fathala reserve, Senegal. We analyzed the data from 30 cameras operating during a 66 -day sampling period deployed in two densities in grid and line arrays. We captured and identified all 16 individuals in 962 trap-days. Abundances were estimated in the programs CAPTURE (models M 0, Mh and Mh Chao) and R, package secr (basic Null and Finite mixture models), and compared with the true population size. We specified 66 days as a threshold in which SECR provides an accurate estimate in all trapping designs within the 7 -times divergent density from 0. 004 to 0. 028 camera trap/ha. Both SECR models showed uniform tendency to overestimate abundance when sampling lasted shorter with no major differences between their outputs. Unlike the closed models, SECR performed well in the line patterns, which indicates promising potential for linear sampling of properly defined habitats of non-territorial and identifiable herbivores in dense wooded savanna conditions. The CR models provided reliable estimates in the grid and we confirmed the advantage of Mh Chao estimator over Mh jackknife when data appeared sparse. We also demonstrated the pooling of trapping occasions with an increase in the capture probabilities, avoiding violation of results...|$|R

50|$|Gaborone Game Reserve, {{near the}} city of Gaborone, has a small area of 600 ha but {{provides}} for popular viewing along roads. It has plenty of birds and wild life in its precincts The reserve is habitat of thorn scrub and woodland to riverine forest and marshland which attracts a wide variety of birds such as raptors a snake eagle, crimson boubou (a genus of brightly coloured, carnivorous passerine bird) and gallinule. Faunal species seen here are the rhino, impala, kudu, ostriches, wildebeest, zebra, gemsbok, bushbuck, springbok, duiker the giant eland (Taurotragus derbianus also known as the Lord <b>Derby</b> <b>eland),</b> which is Africa's largest antelope.|$|E
50|$|There {{is a small}} {{population}} of about 30 lions, which belong to the endangered West African lion population. Elephants, spotted hyena, water buck, warthog and monkeys are {{also found in the}} park. The predominant large ungulates in the park are antelope such as the kob, western hartebeest, Lord Derby’s eland and waterbuck, as well as buffalo. The only place in Africa where there is a realistic change to view the <b>Derby</b> <b>eland,</b> Africa's largest antelope, is within Bénoué National Park. The African wild dog is present within the national park, though less common here than in Faro National Park. Bénoué National Park is known for its hippopotamus colonies. Along with hippo, crocodile are common in the rivers.Bénoué National Park is an Important Bird Area (#CM007) with recent surveys identifying 306 species. In the dry season, sandbars exposed by fluctuating levels of the sandy Bénoué River provide habitat for plover and other waterbirds. Common species include Adamawa turtle-dove, crocodile bird, red-throated bee-eater, red-winged grey warbler, stone partridge, and violet turaco.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this diploma thesis was to compare diet quality of large herbivores across European and African continents. The particular aims were: 1) to determine concentrations of macronutrients (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and fibre fractions (NDF, ADF, ADL) in faeces of selected 17 species of large herbivores, 2) to compare concentrations of these macronutrients and fibre fractions in faeces within the ruminants adopting different foraging strategies and non-ruminants separately in European and African localities, 3) to test the functional link between concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus in animal faeces and in soil on pasture. In total, 281 faecal samples were collected from 17 animal species, i. e. : Loxodonta africana, Equus asinus, E. caballus, E. zebra quagga; Bos taurus, Syncerus caffer, Alcelaphus buselaphus, Damaliscus pygargus pygargus, Hippotragus equinus, Kobus ellipsiprymnus, Antidorcas marsupialis, Ovis aries, Bison bonasus, Alces alces, Taurotragus oryx, Taurotragus derbianus, Capra aegagrus hircus from 10 countries (Senegal, Chad, Zambia, Republic of South Africa, Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Hungary, Iceland, Netherlands, Norway) together with soil representative samples from each locality. The samples were analysed for concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, NDF, ADF, ADL and concentrations of FN and FP were used for determination of diet quality. Herbivores from Africa had lower concentrations of FN and FP and higher ratios of N:P and Ca:P in comparison to herbivores from Europe. The highest lignin concentrations had concentrate selectors (moose, <b>Derby</b> and giant <b>eland),</b> thus reflecting the high concentration of lignin in browse. Within the non-ruminants, equids from Europe were superior in diet quality to African species, with highest fibre concentrations in elephants and lowest concentration of K together with highest concentrations of Mg in faeces of zebra. Finally, the relationship between plants available N, P in soil and FN, FP in investigated herbivorous animals was not proved, proposing more investigation concern to soil-plant-herbivores relationships...|$|R
5000|$|Bénoué National Park {{was first}} {{established}} as a faunal reserve in 1932. It was upgraded to national park status in 1968, and in 1981, it became a biosphere reserve. Its habitat is in the Bénoué savanna belt, a humid savannah woodland area. The park encompasses an area of 180000 ha in size and has a wide frontage to the Bénoué River. The main river flowing through the park is the Bénoué River, which stretches for over 100 km, forming the eastern boundary. The park's altitude ranges from 250 - 760 m above sea level. The higher elevations are characterized by large rocky massifs, while the undulating plain and forest characterizes the lower sections. Eight hunting reserves, totaling 520378 ha, surround the park except along the main road. [...] Access to the park from the north is from Ngaoundéré. Wildlife reported from the park consists of elephants, spotted hyena, water buck, warthog, monkeys, large ungulates such as antelope, the <b>Derby</b> <b>eland</b> (Africa's largest antelope), kob, western hartebeest, Lord Derby’s eland and waterbuck and buffalo. The African wild dog is also present here. The hippopotamus colonies and crocodile are common in the rivers. As an Important Bird Area according to recent surveys 306 species have been identified. In the dry season, sandbars exposed by fluctuating levels of the sandy Bénoué River provide habitat for plover and other waterbirds.|$|E
40|$|Representatives {{of family}} Bovidae are {{subjects}} of many studies concerning with their phylogeny, phylogeography, time of divergence or genetic diversity. Taxonomy is solved by comparison of morphological characteristics or by genetic approaches, genetic diversity could {{be solved by}} pedigree or by genetic analyses too. Tragelaphinae number nine species of two genera, Tragelaphus sp. and Taurotragus sp. The antelopes of the genus Taurotragus (T. derbianus and T. oryx) belong to the largest antelopes of the world. <b>Derby</b> <b>eland</b> (Taurotragus derbianus) has two subspecies, Western <b>Derby</b> <b>eland</b> (T. d. derbianus) and Eastern Giant eland (T. d. gigas), which are distinguished {{on the basis of}} morphological characteristics. Western subspecies (T. d. derbianus) is classified as critically endangered. There lives the only population in Niokolo Koba National Park in Senegal, which numbers fewer than 200 individuals. For the conservation, the semi-captive breeding programme has been established in 2000. It was created by six founders (one male and five females), which are presumed to be non-related. The population within this programme had 95 living individuals in 2013, living in seven herds in Bandia and Fathala reserves in Senegal. The population is under breeding management, which efforts to minimize kinship of the individuals. Studbook was established for the Western <b>Derby</b> <b>eland</b> (T. d. derbianus) in 2008 and is published annually. It acts about small population with low number of founders and no gene flow, which is threatened by inbreeding and genetic drift. Genetic diversity of the population was evaluated by means of microsatellite markers and the results were compared with the results of pedigree analysis. Pedigree analysis showed the highest genetic diversity in the generation of founders (FOUNDERS). It decreased in the generation of founders' offspring (OFFSPRING 1; born in season 2007 / 2008), due to the fact, that the only male took part in the reproduction. And it increased again in the generation of offspring of founders' offspring (OFFSPRING 2; born in the season 2009 / 2010), because more individuals were included into the reproduction. Fifteen individuals and five polymorphic microsatellite loci (from the total number of 13 tested loci) were chosen for the genetic study. The parameters of genetic diversity (HE and HO, Ar and deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, and FIS and FST) were evaluated. Not any deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were found out. The results of genetic analysis confirmed the highest genetic diversity in the population of founders (Ar = 2. 79; HE = 0. 664; HO = 0. 750; FIS = [...] 0. 154). In both generations of offspring values of allelic richness and observed and expected heterozygosity decreased (Ar = 2. 15; HO = 0. 580; HE = 0. 586 in OFFSPRING 1 and Ar = 2. 14; HO = 0. 370; HE = 0. 480 in OFFSPRING 2). Contrary to the results of pedigree analysis, there was not been observed any improvement in OFFSPRING 2. The resultant values of genetic diversity parameters were quite satisfactory, despite of the low number of founders and mating of related individuals...|$|E
40|$|The {{wildlife}} {{populations of}} Northern Central African Republic experienced precipitous declines during the 1970 s and 1980 s. While anecdotes {{coming out of}} the region indicate that the wildlife populations remain under serious threat, little is known about their status. An aerial sample count was carried out in the Northern Central African Republic {{at the end of the}} dry season in June 2005 and covered an 85, 000  km 2 complex landscape containing national parks, hunting reserves and community hunting areas. Results show a dramatic decline of wildlife since the previous survey in 1985. In 20  years, large mammals’ numbers decreased by 65 %, probably because of poaching and diseases brought by illegal cattle transhumance. Elephant (Loxodonta africana) and Buffon kob (Kobus kob) populations showed the greatest decline (over 80 % each), while buffalo (Syncerus caffer), roan antelope (Hippotragus equinus) and Giant Lord’s <b>Derby</b> <b>Eland</b> (Taurotragus derbianus) populations seem stable or increasing over these last 20  years. The analysis of the wildlife population distribution by status of the different types of protected areas (national parks, hunting areas) showed that individual encounter rates of elephant and buffalo were lower in national parks than in neighbouring hunting areas, while those for roan, giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) and Buffon kob were higher in the national parks...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} under the topic, Soils in Africa as source of mineral {{nutrition}} for large herbivores was to analyze soil in two reserves in Senegal. The first one was the Bandia reserve and the second one was the Fathala reserve. At these reserves a concervation program of Western <b>Derby</b> <b>Eland</b> (Taurotragus derbianus) is been run by Czech university of Life Sciences in Prague. The purpose of this research was to find out if these soils can be used as source of minerals for large herbivores practicing geophagy. This phenomen of deliberate ingestion of soil is well documented among wild animals and also among humans. The animals were observed eating soil in the past and in Bandia reserve artifical mineral licks are provided. They are many important factors that are considered for animals which eat soil. Three major ones that were tested include mineral concentrations, pH and clay content. Mineral concentrations were tested by the use of X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy analysis, pH was tested by soil pH meter and clay content was established by particle size distribution analysis. Suitability of soil was fulfilled just in two of the factors which are clay content and pH. Mineral concentrations were found to be too low to supply animals needs. It was also proved that there is signifiant difference in soil characteristics between different habitats (dry and wet) and reserves...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal homologies {{have been}} {{established}} between cattle (Bos taurus, 2 n= 60) and eight species of spiral-horned antelope, Tribe Tragelaphini: Nyala (Tragelaphus angasii, 2 n= 55 ♂/ 56 ♀), Lesser kudu (T. imberbis, 2 n= 38 ♂,♀), Bongo (T. eurycerus, 2 n= 33 ♂/ 34 ♀), Bushbuck (T. scriptus, 2 n= 33 ♂/ 34 ♀), Greater kudu (T. strepsiceros, 2 n= 31 ♂/ 32 ♀), Sitatunga (T. spekei, 2 n= 30 ♂,♀) <b>Derby</b> <b>eland</b> (Taurotragus derbianus 2 n= 31 ♂/ 32 ♀) and Common eland (T. oryx 2 n= 31 ♂/ 32 ♀). Chromosomes involved in centric fusions in these species were identified using {{a complete set of}} cattle painting probes generated by laser microdissection. Our data support the monophyly of Tragelaphini and a clade comprising T. scriptus, T. spekei, T. euryceros and the eland species T. oryx and T. derbianus, findings that are largely in agreement with sequence-based molecular phylogenies. In contrast, our study suggests that the arid adaptiveness of T. oryx and T. derbianus is recent. Finally, we have identified the presence of the rob(1; 29) fusion as an evolutionary marker in most of the tragelaphid species investigated. This rearrangement is associated with reproductive impairment in cattle and raises questions whether subtle distinctions in breakpoint location or differential rescue during meiosis underpin the different outcomes detected among these lineages. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.
