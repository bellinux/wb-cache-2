40|$|We present Caffe con Troll (CcT), a fully {{compatible}} end-to-end {{version of the}} popular framework Caffe with rebuilt internals.

Moreover, with these improvements, the end-to-end training time <b>for</b> <b>CNNs</b> is directly proportional to the FLOPS delivered by the CPU, which enables us to efficiently train hybrid CPU-GPU systems <b>for</b> <b>CNNs...</b>|$|R
