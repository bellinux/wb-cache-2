500|$|Stahlschmidt {{suspected}} that Thomas Hatch was first based in Canterbury, but, from {{late in the}} 16th century, the Hatch family of bellfounders was based at Roses Farm, Broomfield, near Maidstone, where Thomas Hatch may have first taken up residence in 1587. In 1889, W.Scott Robertson noted that the property of Roses Farm straddled {{the boundary between the}} parishes of Broomfield and Ulcombe: in a receipt for work on the bells at Birchington-on-Sea in 1606 Joseph Hatch described himself as [...] "of Bromfeild", and he was buried in the churchyard at Broomfield, but he said in his will of 1639 that he was [...] "of Ulcombe". Stahlschmidt considered it unlikely that the foundry was among the property bequeathed to Joseph Hatch's widow Jane, which included the main <b>dwelling-house</b> of Roses Farm, in Broomfield, and a smaller house adjacent, so it must have lain elsewhere. Bellfounding did not require dedicated buildings, and bells were sometimes cast {{in the vicinity of the}} churches for which they were made, but Stahlschmidt also reported a statement by JamesT. Hatch, a descendant of the same family, that the Hatch foundry was: ...|$|E
500|$|Wilson was {{an early}} member of the Massachusetts Bay Company, and {{accompanied}} John Winthrop and the Winthrop Fleet to New England in 1630. [...] As soon as they arrived, he, with Governor Winthrop, Thomas Dudley, and Isaac Johnson, entered into a formal and solemn covenant {{with each other to}} walk together in the fellowship of the gospel. [...] Life was harsh in the new wilderness, and Plymouth historian Nathaniel Morton said that Wilson [...] "bare a great share of the difficulties of these new beginnings with great cheerfulness and alacrity of spirit." [...] Wilson was chosen the pastor of their first church in Charlestown, being installed as teacher there on 27 August 1630, and in the same month the General Court ordered that a <b>dwelling-house</b> should be built for him at the public expense, and the governor and Sir Richard Saltonstall were appointed to put this into effect. [...] By the same authority it was also ordered, that Wilson's salary, until the arrival of his wife, should be 20 pounds a year. [...] After the Charlestown church was established, most of its members moved across the Charles River to Boston, after which services were held alternately {{on each side of the}} river, and then later only in Boston.|$|E

40|$|On 28 September 1987, the {{resolution}} No. 264 On Further Development of Individual Housing in the Republic {{passed by the}} Central Committee of the Council of Ministers of the Lithuanian SSR restored the typological group of private <b>dwelling-houses</b> to Lithuanian towns after a break of nearly three decades. Post-modern trends in architecture that prevailed in western countries at that time reached Lithuania {{in the form of}} limited spectrum of architectural press. Architectural expression of individual <b>dwelling-houses</b> in Lithuania relied specifically on projects published in foreign magazines (mostly, of Japan, the U. S. A and Western Europe), and later – in the local periodicals. Different features of such analogous architecture were adapted in Lithuanian <b>dwelling-houses</b> in different ways: the spatial structure of the building was used and interpreted in ones, while in the others – only certain specific details, most often published in such professional press. Three groups of individual <b>dwelling-houses</b> were formed: the elite – benchmark-type, typical -adapted and self-taught architecture. They represented examples of architecture, which over the ten-year’s period were built in parallel and intense mode, until finally the economic conditions prevalent in the post-Soviet Lithuania led to the more practical approach to one’s housing, and the style of post-modernism became unfashionable in Lithuania just like in the remaining part of the world...|$|R

2500|$|The {{locality}} where Hay township developed {{was originally}} known as Lang’s Crossing place (named after three brothers named Lang who were leaseholders of {{runs on the}} southern side of the river). [...] It was the crossing on the Murrumbidgee River of a well-travelled stock-route (known as [...] "the Great North Road") leading to the markets of Victoria. [...] In 1856-7 Captain Francis Cadell, pioneer of steam-navigation on the Murray River, placed a manager at Lang’s Crossing-place {{with the task of}} establishing a store (initially in a tent). [...] In December 1857 Thomas Simpson re-located from Deniliquin to establish a blacksmith shop and residence at Lang’s Crossing-place. [...] Six months later the Canadian shipwright Henry Leonard arrived; he commenced building a hotel and <b>dwelling-house</b> near Simpson’s buildings and launched a punt on the river. [...] In August 1858 steamers owned by rival owners, Francis Cadell and William Randell, successfully travelled up the Murrumbidgee as far as Lang’s Crossing-place (with Cadell’s steamer Albury continuing up-river to Gundagai).|$|E
