40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis thesis evaluates {{the adequacy of}} the financial management and budgeting training provided to <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> officers in the United States Marine Corps. Data, based on the responses to a questionnaire, were compiled to summarize the perspective of operating unit supply officers regarding their financial management/budgeting training. This information is contrasted with data obtained during interviews with selected financial managers in the operating forces regarding their views on the performance levels of supply officers relative to their financial and budgeting duties. The author concludes that the current financial training is not adequate considering the scope of a supply officer's duties at the operating unit level. The author recommends: (1) that the training be expanded to approximately twice its current instruction length and include practical application exercises and (2) that professional financial managers, not supply personnel, conduct the financial/budgeting instruction at the <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> officers course.

50|$|One {{other problem}} can {{happen with the}} wattage rating of the power supply. There are 2 Dell power {{supplies}} that were used for different Inspiron models which have the same plug assembly and voltage, a 65 watt supply model PA-6 and a 90 watt supply model PA-9. Some models (for example the Inspiron 1100) shipped with a PA-9. If a PA-6 (or equivalent aftermarket supply) is used in these models then the system might not boot at times. In such cases, it will light the battery light {{for a few seconds}} when the <b>supply</b> is <b>plugged</b> in. This can also happen if the power supply becomes marginal. Marginal supplies can show as supplying full voltage even if tested with a volt meter while the <b>supply</b> is <b>plugged</b> into the computer and an attempt is made to turn on the computer.|$|R

40|$|The {{convergence}} of advanced process technology, increasing levels of integration and higher operating frequencies pose considerable challenge to FPGA designers whose circuits {{are required to}} function in variety of conditions. Full-custom and mixed signal circuit designers ensure that their circuits will function by simulating for various operating conditions (PVT, input stimuli, etc). One key aspect for the reliable operation of these complex circuits {{is the quality of}} the voltage supply they receive. However, it is becoming increasingly apparent that traditional and existing methods of considering power supply variation and noise is grossly inadequate and do not consider the multiple factors that contribute to power and <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> noise. Also existing methods do not provide sufficient capabilities to predict the impact of the fluctuation in the power and <b>ground</b> <b>supplies</b> on various key circuit parameters like noise margin, clock jitter, and delays. Additionally, in traditional IC design methodologies, the custom IPs are typically designed and verified independently of the environment they operate in.

40|$|ABSTRACT- By the full-wave {{electromagnetic}} field simulation, {{the effectiveness of}} certain measures to reduce the power and ground noise coupling in mixed signal modules is investigated. Segmentation of power and ground planes and proper placement of decoupling capacitors for the reduction of noise coupling are evaluated. With the boom of portable communications industry, challenges in designs of mixed signal modules are becoming increasingly serious. Severe electromagnetic interference may occur in highdensity mixed signal electronic modules. Switching currents of output drivers of high-speed digital circuits can generate significant noise in power and <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> systems. Power and <b>ground</b> <b>supply</b> noise, together with the noise coupled to the analog and digital signal distribution systems, may cause malfunctioning of both digital and analog circuits. This presentation provides investigations {{on the effectiveness of}} some techniques used for the reduction of power and ground noise coupling. As shown in Figure 1, segmentation of power and/or ground planes are often used for the isolation of different parts of circuits [1]. As signal traces pass through split power or ground planes, severe signal integrity issues will appear [2]. Bridges connecting segmented metal planes provide adjacent current return paths for such traces...|$|R
