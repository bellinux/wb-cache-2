40|$|Previous {{chapters}} {{have examined}} {{issues related to}} the role of the IMF in the world economy. How did the Fund’s role evolve in dealing with matters as diverse as the <b>erratic</b> <b>value</b> of the U. S. dollar, the debt crisis in Latin America, and the worsening spiral of poverty in Africa? How did it obtain and manage its resources and deal with a growing membership? This final chapter turns inward for a closer look at the institution itself. As the Fund took on a widening circle of responsibilities, its relations with other multilateral organizations inevitably became more complex. To a much greater extent than before, the Fund saw a need to explain itself and its functions regularly and actively. More subtly, its organizational structure, management, and staff evolved and modernized to cope with a rapidly changing world economy. Collaboration In an ideal world, each international organization would serve a unique purpose and would perfectly coordinate its work with others as appropriate. In practice, purposes and activities overlap in ways that change in response to events and require ad hoc rather than resolute coordination. The IMF’s relations with other organizations did not change fundamentally during the 1980 s, but they did evolve, mainly in response to the debt crisis and the need for structural reforms in many borrowing countries. 1 World Bank The most important linkage for the Fund is its relationship with the World Bank. The two have always been known as the “Bretton Woods twins ” 2 and more 1 This section gives a selective review of the Fund’s relations with other institutions, focusing on the main players. Fund staff and management also had recurring interactions with many other organizations, including notably the regional development banks. 2 The term originated in a speech by John Maynard Keynes to the inaugural meeting of the Boards of Governors, at Savannah, Georgia, in March 1946 : “The gestation has been long; the lusty twins are seriously overdue [...] . (and I shall always hold to the view that the christening has been badly done and that the names of the twins should have been reversed). ” Quoted in Harrod (1951), p. 631...|$|E
50|$|DLI uses a {{metallic}} vaporizer or an additional metal hot plate {{to convert the}} liquid to gas. This process works best for mid-range flow rates. At low flow rates there is little control and limited accuracy, while at high flow rates the process is susceptible to bubbles in the liquid, which generate <b>erratic</b> <b>values.</b> DLI offers a low operating cost, good flow control and limited safety issues. DLI can vaporize only limited quantities due to thermal transfer rates, {{and there is a}} potential for chemical decomposition. Most critically, it cannot provide any purification of the liquid being vaporized; everything in the liquid is vaporized into the process. With direct liquid injection systems, increasing flow rate leads to incomplete vaporization. This increases micro droplet formation, which increases non-uniformity and ionic contamination on the wafer.|$|R
30|$|Given the <b>erratic</b> <b>values</b> {{obtained}} for the parameter τ, {{in order to obtain}} smooth parameters in the NS model and also to reduce problems of multicollinearity in their estimation, it is common in the literature on yield curve forecasting to fix τ at a constant value over the whole sample of the term structure and to estimate the beta parameters by ordinary least squares (OLS) fitting interest rates, as in Diebold and Li (2006). Given that our database is composed of coupon bonds, together with bills and repos, we still apply weighted nonlinear least squares, but fix τ at a constant value, to obtain beta parameters by minimizing (2) (see Bank for International Settlements 2005 for the Spanish yield curve). In any case, the dimensionality of the optimization problem is reduced when τ is fixed at a constant value, and this also avoids the need to forecast the highly erratic parameter τ. We term these τ-fixed estimations and find them very interesting from the standpoint of predictive quality.|$|R

After {{this work was}} completed, a 3,392 ton bulk sample was taken from an open pit in January 1992 to confirm old assay results on the Beanland Vein. Equipment consisted of a Caterpillar D6, a Gardner-Denver hydraulic track drill and a John Deere backhoe to remove the blasted material. The extracted ore was shipped to the Kerr-Addison Mine mill in Virginiatown for processing. All of the ore was stockpiled in the mill yard rather than being directly dumped into the crusher and therefore directly into the mill. Because the ore was stockpiled, where it froze {{and had to be}} blasted, it was handled twice which put up the costs of the milling. The mill results were not as high as expected. It was discovered that the ore had a higher percentage in silver than gold. The cause of this was probably due to a deposit of silver hidden in the very high <b>erratic</b> <b>values</b> of gold and silver. Such an occurrence is quite common in the Cobalt-Temagami area. Since the bulk sample was taken in January 1992, it was very cold and experienced a lot of dilution of ore due to overload of holes. Because of the cold weather, the test pit had to be [...] wide. Beanland Mine has remained idle since 1992.|$|R
40|$|Several studies, {{primarily}} Kornacki and Fegley (1986) and Munker et. al. (2003), {{suggested that}} calcium-aluminum-rich inclusions (CAIs) {{common to the}} CV 3 subclass of chondritic meteorites contain significantly lower Nb-Ta ratios than the accepted bulk solar system value. These studies have lead me postulate that; CV 3 carbonaceous chondrites display, on average, low Nb/Ta values because of the low Nb/Ta values in the CAIs. Calcium, titanium, niobium, tantalum, zirconium, and hafnium abundances were obtained via LA-ICP-MS analysis on five chondrules, two CAIs, and the matrix from the CV 3 carbonaceous chondrite Allende. The matrix displayed Nb/Ta and Zr/Hf values that encompass around the accepted bulk solar system values of 19. 9 ± 2 and 34. 3 ± 3. 5 respectively. The chondrules extracted from Allende displayed variable Nb/Ta values that ranged from 3. 8 to 24. 2 (1 σ = 10 %), and Zr/Hf values that ranged from 30. 4 to 41. 0 (1 σ = 10 %). The CAIs displayed consistently low Nb/Ta values that ranged from 0. 9 to 12. 7 (1 σ = 10 %), and <b>erratic</b> Zr/Hf <b>values</b> that ranged from 12 to 73 (1 σ = 10 %). The Nb-Ta ratios {{in comparison with the}} Zr-Hf ratios show evidence that fractionation of Nb and Ta occurred independently of any Zr and Hf fractionation.

40|$|The Upper Neoproterozoic-Lower Cambrian {{sedimentary}} succession in the Central Iberian Zone {{has recently}} been divided into 12 sedimentary units (I to XII). Units I to IV are of Late Neoproterozoic age, and units V to XII are Early Cambrian. Throughout the stratigraphic section, shales with similar ranges of SiO 2 and Al 2 O 3 have TiO 2 and Zr contents that are coupled and vary gradually from the bottom (unit I, TiO 2 = 1. 0 - 1. 1 %, Zr = 245 - 287 ppm) to the top (unit XII, TiO 2 = 0. 74 - 0. 86 %, Zr = 141 - 192 ppm). These two parameters clearly distinguish Upper Neoproterozoic from Lower Cambrian compositions, as do certain elemental ratios (Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2, Rb/Zr, Nb/Ti), which vary from low values {{at the bottom of}} the section to high at the top. However, other elements (the rare earth elements [REEs], Y) do not fit this general trend, with heavy REEs and Y showing extreme concentrations in some Lower Cambrian units, which also have negative Ce anomalies. Units I to III and units XI to XII have uniform T DM neodymium model ages (~ 1. 1 and 1. 7 Ga, respectively), but the units between these two groups have <b>erratic</b> <b>values</b> between 1. 4 Ga (unit VII) and 3. 4 Ga (unit VIII). Thus, the bottom and top units have neodymium isotope ratios that indicate the presence of two source compositions: a composition that records a juvenile contribution younger than 1. 1 Ga and a composition mainly derived from an old basement. Some samples from Lower Cambrian units have disturbed REE abundances and neodymium isotope ratios that are attributed to extensive chemical alteration that resulted in REE and Y redistribution. This alteration probably affected the material now preserved as unit IV during a period of relative sea level fall at the end of the Late Neoproterozoic. Both elemental and isotopic results support the suggestion that the Upper Neoproterozoic-Lower Cambrian stratigraphic section records an inverse stratigraphy of a source hinterland composed of a cover sequence of relatively juvenile crustal materials underlain by an older basement. Through time, the deeper crust gradually increased its contribution to the sediments in the basin from Late Neoproterozoic to Lower Cambrian times. These results are compatible with data from many other European zones. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The casual {{observation}} of dogfishes in aquaria reveals immediately a noteworthy regularity in the rhythmic {{movement of the}} gill-slits. The movements of the spiracles are coordinated in a perfect way {{with those of the}} slits and they go on with the same regularity, without in terruption, for long periods. All these features seemed to point to the suitability of this animal for a study of the frequency of gill move ments as controlled by temperature. The previous work of Bethe, Baglioni, and others had shown con siderable irregularity in the Q 10 ratio (cf. Kanitz, 1915); the observa tions of Crozier and Stier (1924 â€” 25) on the opercular breathing rhythm in the goldfish, on the contrary, showed regularity in this rhythm under properly controlled conditions and demonstrated the applicability of the Arrhenius equation to the data obtained. Would the dogfish obey the same nile and in a similar way? For the observations, young specimens (25 to 37 cm. long) were kept in a large aquarium the temperature of which was maintained constant to within Â± 0. 05 Â ° C. for periods of 30 to 50 minutes at any given temperature. The number of points on the thermometric scale chosen for the observations was made as large as possible, and in gen eral at each temperature from 20 to 30 series of 20 beats were timed with a stop watch. The regularity of the breathing rhythm at constant temperature is remarkable; countings of 20 to 30 successive series of 20 beats often agreed to within 1 to 2 per cent. The only exception seems to be around 15 Â°C. where more <b>erratic</b> <b>values</b> are found. We will come back later to this point. Let us note also that Crozier and Stier have found agreement of the same order of magnitude. Care was taken to allow time for complete temperature equilibrium between the organism and the medium, the water of the aquarium also being stirred gently. The aquarium was almost completely insulated by a cover which. cut out most of the light; {{a small portion of the}} surface only was left uncovered to permit observation. The water in the aquarium was kept as close as possible to saturation with air, so as to exclude any possible effect of 02 concentration. Observations mad...|$|R
40|$|Highway runoff, as a nonpoint source, may exert {{significant}} {{pollutant load}} on the catchment. Finding ways to mitigate nonpoint sources of pollutants {{is a matter of}} great concern for improving water quality. It was cited by the Environment Agency in 2005 that more than 80 % of English rivers were at risk of failing to achieve Water Framework Directive (WFD) objectives through diffuse pollution (Faram, 2007; p. 14). The presence and behaviour of metals were analysed and compared through seasonal sampling from one of the most trafficked roads in the Midlands, M 1. These were compared with other sources: local streams and sewage works. The concentration of metals in stormwater from the M 1, three neighbouring rural brooks and three local sewage works, all in the same catchment, were sampled. Three metals (Fe, Cu and Zn) were used as an indicator because of their predominance and potential harmful effect on biodiversity. The data was analysed to establish any links between the total and dissolved metals and standard water quality parameters. The thesis also examines the performance of a standard highway treatment system of interceptor and lagoon for removing metals. The results indicate that evaporation and de-icer salts had the strongest effect on metal concentrations and their solubility in the runoff from the M 1. As additional factors, rainfall intensity and antecedent dry weather period (ADWP) had the most important influence on metal concentrations. Fe was always at the highest concentrations for all weather conditions (total and dissolved) and all sampling locations. The results also showed that Fe was affiliated with the particulate matter; however, it was also suggested that it was solubilised by anaerobic conditions. Zntot during wet weather exceeded the environmental quality standards (EQS) both on the M 1 and in Woodbrook. The sewage work effluent did not exceed the EQS at any time of sampling. It was also found that Zn solubility was increased by the presence of de-icer salts which released it from the sediment by a process of ion-exchange, as suggested by the literature. Cu concentrations had the most <b>erratic</b> <b>values</b> and varied widely but were in the lowest concentrations compared to other metals. During wet weather Cudis from the M 1 runoff exceeded the EQS. It was also concluded that the analytical and sample preservation methods chosen could {{have an effect on the}} concentrations of copper. Filtration with recycled glass and pea-gravel was able to remove particles down to 5 μm, but at the typical flow rate (5 m/hr), and solids loading the filters would need regular washing. The adsorption studies showed that metals are more effectively removed by alkaline conditions than acid conditions which release metals into the environment.

It borrows from ancient Persian, Greek, Egyptian, Chinese, Phoenician, even Native American, mythologies of the fire bird {{in order to create}} the effect of an ancient world. The use of a phoenix, a statuette, might compel the reader to ponder if the {{narrative}} should target children. But the story alludes to sex and intimacy, hinges around romantic relationship, all themes that surround the interests of an adolescent. In this element, it presents itself as crossover text (Beckton 2014) where a child, a young adolescent (perhaps 12 – 13), a new adult (aged 17 +, capped at 25), even an adult may read it and find enjoyment. Young adult literature has had its share of authors who have stretched boundaries (Crowe 2002 : 116). Take example of J. K. Rowling’s Harry Potter novels that started off as children’s stories, but gathered strength in adolescents, and adults. The use of narratological devices such as voice, theme and dialogue in ‘Gaze of the phoenix’ help to engage the reader, irrespective of whichever audience preconception they may approach the story with. The period of emerging adulthood is, for some, relatively free of ‘the rules of childhood and the responsibilities of adulthood’ (Halpern-Meekin et al. : 3), but situations can occur to a young adult that stem from emotional and relational conflict, things that forge <b>erratic</b> behaviour where <b>value</b> systems are not well shaped.

5000|$|On 2 April 2015, the BEA {{announced}} that a consensus had emerged that <b>erratic</b> and erroneous <b>values</b> of the EPR appeared for both engines two to three minutes after levelling off {{at an altitude of}} 31,000 ft. The EPR is the main parameter for engine power management, and is derived from pressure sensors at the engine inlets. The sensors had probably become clogged with ice in this case. Such icing is normally prevented by a hot-air system, which likely was not activated by the aircrew during climb and cruise, according to BEA [...] "analysis of the available data". The faulty EPR values caused the engine controllers to limit the thrust to much less than required to maintain sufficient airspeed for stability at the altitude that the autopilot tried to maintain by increasing the angle of attack until stall occurred. Twenty seconds after the initial stall, the plane suddenly rolled sharply left to almost full inversion as the autopilot disengaged, and pitched nose down to near vertical. The BEA notes that [...] "the recorded parameters indicate that there were no stall recovery manœuvres by the crew", while the flight control surface deflections remained those that would normally intend nose-up and right-roll. The BEA noted two previous similar incidents involving MD-82 and MD-83 aircraft, where the aircrews were alert enough to notice the loss of airspeed and intervene before loss of control. The first one was Spirit Airlines Flight 970. The aircraft involved, registered as N823NK, was a MD-82 flying in mid day in June 2002 when it suffered a loss of thrust on both engines, in cruise at an altitude of 33,000 ft, that is about 10,000 m. The two pressure sensors, located on the engine nose bullets, were blocked by ice crystals, leading to incorrect indications and over-estimation of the EPR. The crew noticed the drop in speed and the precursor indications of a stall just before disengagement of the autopilot and putting the aeroplane into a descent. They had not activated the engine anti-ice systems. The second one involved was a MD-83 operated by Swiftair that occurred in June 2014. The crew was aware of the drop of their airspeed and successfully recovered.|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{primarily}} explored the specificities {{of the process}} used for the friction-stir welding (FSW) of the magnesium (Mg) alloys (both SSC and wrought) to themselves and to 6061 -T 6 aluminum (Al), {{as well as the}} microstructural analysis of the resultant welds {{in order to understand the}} fundamental mechanisms involved in the mixing of these metals. Dissimilar Mg alloy systems included the FSW of AZ 91 D with AM 60, and the FSW of AZ 91 D with AZ 31 B-H 24. Both Mg AZ 91 D and AZ 31 B-H 24 alloys were welded to 6061 -T 6 Al. Dissimilar Al alloy welds included the FSW of Al 6061 -T 6 to Al 5052 -H 34. ^ Dynamic recrystallization was observed in the weld region as well as in the transition region (HAZ), with a clear decrease in the grain size from the base material through the transition zone and into the FSW zone. The welds were free of porosities. ^ The FSW zone in the welds of Mg alloys (AZ 31 B and AZ 91 D) to 6061 -T 6 A 1 showed unique dissimilar-weld characteristics such as complex intercalated microstructures with lamellar-like bands of Mg-rich and Al-rich regions. EDX analysis of the weld zones revealed bands with equal parts of Mg and Al, as well as unique recrystallized bands with predominance of either material were observed. The transition from the HAZ to the FSW zone consistently shows a sharp demarcation on either side of the weld. The transition from the Mg AZ 31 B HAZ to the FSW zone reveals a demarcation band region that uniquely characterizes all Mg AZ 31 B-Al 6061 -T 6 welds. In the case of the FSW of Mg AZ 91 D-Al 6061 -T 6, the demarcation band was revealed to form in the retreating side of the weld. ^ Vickers microhardness testing performed on the weld cross-sections provided microhardness profiles that revealed the compensation of the normal degradation of 6061 -T 6 Al in the HAZ. It was also noticed that all the Mg-AI welds showed very high and <b>erratic</b> microhardness <b>values</b> in the weld zone, in comparison to the base material. ^ The dissimilar Mg alloy welds revealed a homogenous, equi-axed, fine-grain structure in the FSW zone, along with complex intercalated microstructures. A sharp demarcation was seen on the advancing side (AZ 91 D) and a fairly diffuse flow was observed on the retreating side (AM 60 B) for both sets of solid fractions. Vickers microhardness testing on the dissimilar Mg alloy systems revealed no degradation of residual microhardness of the material in the FSW zone or the transition zone. Limited TEM studies of these welds revealed dense dislocation structures. Considering the Hall-Petch relationship, both the presence of dense dislocation structures and the decrease in weld zone grain sizes might be contributing to the lack of degradation observed in the weld region. ^ The FSW of dissimilar Al alloys show a sharp advancing side demarcation, a rather diffuse retreating side, and an intercalated weld zone microstructure. The interfaces within this weld system are also unique in that a very fine boundary layer demarcates the lamellar bands of recrystallized material within the weld zone. The transitioning of the elongated grains into the weld zone, and the widely varying grain structures across the advancing side interface are also confirmations of general weld characteristics. ...|$|R
40|$|Typescript. Thesis (PhD) [...] Macquarie University, 1998. Bibliography: p. 177 - 197. Systematic isotopic {{variations}} in carbon and strontium in the mid-Neoproterozoic (~ 830 - 750 Ma) of Australia have improved stratigraphic resolution within Australian basins and allowed correlation with successions from Canada, Namibia and Spitsbergen. The use of isotopes of carbon, oxygen, sulfur and strontium, and biomarkers, {{all in a}} sedimentologic, tectonic and palaeobiological framework has allowed for the confident recognition of marine and non-marine environments in the ~ 830 Ma Bitter Springs Formation, Amadeus Basin, {{at a time when}} the fossil record is sparse. It has also led to one of the most comprehensive documentations of a Neoproterozoic carbonate anywhere. Little variation in δ¹³Ccarb across the Amadeus Basin allowed the construction of a composite isotopic curve of the Bitter Springs Formation (Supersequence 1), which could then be correlated with other Australian basins. δ¹³Ccarb curves and comparable stromatolite assemblages in Supersequence 1 of the eastern Officer Basin and Arkaroola Subgroup (lower Callanna Group) of the Adelaide Rift Complex allow correlation with the Amadeus Basin. These are the earliest Australian Neoproterozoic sediments, and they were deposited in a shallow epicontinental sea that extended at least into the northern and eastern areas of the Centralian Superbasin, and northern areas of the Adelaide Rift Complex at about 830 Ma. The isotopic study of successions from various basins highlights the importance of interbasinal correlation in confirming marine deposition, which once established allows correlations with global successions possible. In the Amadeus and eastern Officer Basins, and Adelaide Rift Complex a transition to nonmarine deposition then occurred, after which mid-Neoproterozoic sediments are not seen in the Amadeus and eastern Officer Basins. In the Adelaide Rift Complex, this period of nonmarine deposition, represented by the Curdimurka Subgroup, is supported by extremely depleted and <b>erratic</b> δ¹³Ccarb <b>values.</b> Periods where δ¹³Ccarb <b>values</b> are less <b>erratic</b> and closer to 0 ‰ may indicate brief periods of marine deposition. But the inability to correlate carbon isotopic curves across the Adelaide Rift Complex suggests marine incursions were diachronous, and thus sedimentation was dominated by local tectonics in the developing rift basin. This period of dominantly non-marine deposition prevailed from about 800 to 780 Ma. The approximately 780 Ma and younger Burra Group of the Adelaide Rift Complex was mostly deposited under marine conditions. This is shown by correlation of δ¹³Ccarb curves from successions in the Peake and Denison, and southern Flinders Ranges. Correlations between these two successions have allowed for greater stratigraphic resolution within the Burra Group. An Australian Mid-Neoproterozoic (~ 830 - 750 Ma) carbon and strontium isotopic record was then compiled from the Bitter Springs Formation (~ 830 Ma) and Burra Group (~ 780 Ma), with a gap of about 50 m. y. between 830 and 780 Ma. A correlation scheme is proposed along seven tie lines, and is based on a correlation between Australia and Canada at ~ 830 Ma, and Australia, Spitsbergen and Namibia at ~ 760 Ma. The lowest ever recorded seawater ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr ratios in the upper Shaler Supergroup of Canada compare with ratios in evaporites of the ~ 830 Ma Bitter Springs Formation, Amadeus Basin, Australia. Comparable δ¹³Ccarb records support correlation. At about 760 Ma a correlation can be made between the heaviest mid- Neoproterozoic δ¹³Ccarb values of 7. 2 ‰ in Australia (Burra Group, Adelaide Rift Complex), 8. 5 ‰ in Spitsbergen (Backlundtoppen Formation, Akademikerbreen Group), and 8. 5 ‰ in Namibia (Ombombo Subgroup, Congo Craton). The stratigraphic range of Cerebrosphaera buickii, which is restricted to the upper mid-Neopoterozoic (~ 760 Ma) in Australia, supports correlation with Spitsbergen and necessitates a reinterpretation of the Neoproterozoic succession there. There are numerous negative δ¹³Ccarb excursions in a compilation of δ¹³Ccarb and ⁸⁷Sr/⁸⁶Sr records between about 830 and 750 Ma in Australia, Canada, Namibia and Spitsbergen, which are not associated with known glacial deposits. Apart from models involving the release of methane, explanations for these rapid and large carbon isotopic excursions in the Neoproterozoic involve ice sheets that cover most of the Earth's surface. Future models to explain Neoproterozoic Earth history must therefore include mid-Neoproterozoic isotopic records, which differ substantially from late Neoproterozoic records.
