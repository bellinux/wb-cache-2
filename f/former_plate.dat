40|$|The Gawler Craton is an equidimensional crustal {{province}} {{located on}} the southern margin of Australia. It is comprised of a sheared, irregularly shaped, dominantly metasedimentary Archaean nucleus surrounded by Proterozoic-aged plutonic and orogenic rocks (Daly et al., 1998; Hand et al., 2007). The Gawler Craton has undergone three major orogenies; the Sleafordian Orogeny (2480 - 2420 Ma), the Kimban Orogeny (1730 - 1690 Ma) and the Kararan Orogeny (1570 - 1540 Ma) (Betts and Giles, 2006; Daly et al., 1998; Hand et al., 2007). Voluminous magmatism dominated the period between the Kimban and Kararan Orogenies. This included the I-type Tunkillia Suite (1690 - 1670 Ma) and St Peter Suite (1631 - 1608 Ma), and the A-type Hiltaba Suite and its volcanic equivalent the Gawler Range Volcanics (1595 - 1575 Ma) (Hand et al., 2007). This period {{in the evolution of}} the Gawler Craton marks the transition from St Peter Suite magmatism at an inferred <b>former</b> <b>plate</b> margin to intracontinental magmatism associated with the Hiltaba tectonothermal event (Betts and Giles, 2006; Betts et al., 2009; Betts et al., 2007; Hand et al., 2007; Swain et al., 2008). Tectonic models reconstructing the history of the Gawler Craton and Proterozoic Australia have been created (Betts and Giles, 2006; Betts et al., 2009; Betts et al., 2002; Giles et al., 2004; Myers et al., 1996; Wade et al., 2006) although lack of basement outcrop and paucity of data especially at <b>former</b> <b>plate</b> margins means that these models are often poorly resolved (Stewart and Betts, 2010). Additional structural and geochronological data from <b>former</b> <b>plate</b> margins during this significant period is thus required to better constrain tectonic reconstructions. The evolution of arc magmas above subduction zones is a complex multistage process that is still poorly understood despite considerable research and numerous publications (Winter, 2010). It is thought that dehydration of the downgoing slab releases LILE-rich fluid into the overriding mantle causing partial melting forming tholeiitic basaltic magmas (Hawkesworth et al., 1993; Stern, 2002). The production of intermediate to silicic calc-alkaline magmas, which are so voluminously preserved in the upper crust in volcanic arcs, from primary tholeiitic magmas is complex with numerous processes at work (Winter, 2010). Fractional crystallisation (Bachmann and Bergantz, 2004; Gill, 1981; Grove et al., 2003) and assimilation of crustal material and crust-derived magmas during ascent (Hildreth and Moorbath, 1988) are thought to be the dominant processes. The role of fractional melting of earlier arc rocks is less well understood and has been mostly inferred from geochemistry (Tamura and Tatsumi, 2002; Vogel et al., 2004), petrological features within lavas (Bachmann et al., 2002; Murphy et al., 2000) and zircon recycling within arc magmas (Weinberg and Dunlap, 2000; White et al., 2012). This thesis investigates the Palaeoproterozoic arc represented by the calc-alkaline St Peter Suite at two localities: Rocky Point and Westall. These two outcrops have undergone more strain than other St Peter Suite rocks investigated elsewhere (Chalmers, 2009; Wolfram, 2011). Previous investigations on the St Peter Suite have focused on its geochemistry and geochronology (Chalmers, 2009; Flint et al., 1990; Knight, 1997; Rahilly, 2011; Swain et al., 2008; Wolfram, 2011). This research aims to use a multidisciplinary approach, including structural, geochemical and geochronological analysis, to decipher the igneous and structural evolution of the St Peter Suite at these localities thus contributing to constraining the timing and evolution of this plate margin at a time preceding the intracontinental A-type Hiltaba magmatism, and contributing to better understanding magmatic arc processes such as remelting, magma mingling and mixing and continental crust formation...|$|E

40|$|The {{southern}} part of the Central American isthmus is the product of an island arc. It evolved initially as a ridge of primitive island-arc tholeiites at a collision zone between the Farallon plate and proto-Caribbean crust (Albian-Santonian). During the Campanian, a major tectonic event (most probably subduction reversal) caused décollement of different units of the <b>former</b> <b>plate</b> margin. The resulting structural high was covered by a carbonate platform. From Maastrichtian to Eocenc times continuous subduction produced a stable morphotectonic configuration (trench-slope-outer-arc-fore-arccalcalkaline-arc). Fore-arc sedimentation was controlled by volcaniclastic input and tectonic activity along the outer arc's inner margin. Eustatic control is essentially recognized through lowstand signals such as extensive turbidite sand lobes. Steady accretionary uplift of the outer arc gradually closed the bypasses between forc-arc and trench slope. Eustatic control is verified by lowstand signals (sands) on the trench slope and highstand signals on the outer arc (carbonate ramps). During the Oligocene another major tectonic event affected the entire system: accretion ceased, segments decoupled, and regional compression resulted in general uplift and erosion. From latest Oligocene to Pliocene times, three episodes of tilting created a series of fault-angle depressions. Subsidence varies enormously among these basins. but sedimentation is largely shallow marine. Facies architecture reflects complex interactions between tectonic processes, changes in volcaniclastic sediment supply, and eustasy. Subsequently. very strong explosive volcanic activity resulted in excessive sediment input that overfilled most basins. The history of the island arc shows that tectonic processes largely controlled composition, distribution and geometry of the major sedimentary units. Eustatic signals do indeed occur when they are expected, but may be considered as an overprint rather than a dominating factor...|$|E
40|$|International audienceReflection seismic section, field {{structural}} analysis and gravimetric modelling of orogenic lower crust {{in the core}} of a Carboniferous orogenic root reveal details of the polyphase process of exhumation. Subvertical amphibolite facies fabrics strike parallel to <b>former</b> <b>plate</b> margins that collided in the NW. The fabrics are developed in both mid-crustal and lower crustal high-pressure granulite units as a result of intensive NW-SE intraroot horizontal shortening driven probably by the west-directed collision. In granulites, the steep fabrics originated as a result of extrusion of orogenic lower crust in a similar to 20 km wide vertical ascent channel from lower crustal depths at 350 - 340 Ma. The large granulite bodies preserve older granulite facies fabrics documenting a two-stage evolution during the exhumation process. Surface exposures of granulites coincide with the absence of subhorizontal seismic reflectors at depth, suggesting preservation of the similar to 20 km wide subvertical tabular structure reaching Moho depths. Horizontal seismic reflectors surrounding the vertical channel structure corroborate a dominant flat migmatitic fabric developed in all tectonic units. This structural pattern is interpreted in terms of subhorizontal spreading of partially molten orogenic lower crust in mid-crustal levels (765 degrees C and 0. 76 GPa) at 342 - 337 Ma. Large massifs of extruded and progressively dismembered felsic granulites disturbed mid-crustal fabrics in the surrounding horizontally flowing partially molten crust. The horizontal mid-crustal flow resulted in collapse of the supra-crustal Tepla-Barrandian Unit (interpreted as the orogenic lid) along a large-scale crustal detachment above the extruded lower crustal dome. The presence of felsic granulites {{at the bottom of the}} orogenic root is considered to be a key factor controlling the exhumation of orogenic lower crust in large hot orogens...|$|E

40|$|A map-view palinspastic {{restoration}} of tectonic {{units in the}} Alps, Carpathians and Dinarides reveals the plate tectonic configuration {{before the onset of}} Miocene to recent deformations. Estimates of shortening and extension from the entire orogenic system allow for a semi-quantitative {{restoration of}} translations and rotations of tectonic units during the last 20 Ma. Our restoration yielded the following results: (1) The Balaton Fault and its eastern extension along the northern margin of the Mid-Hungarian Fault Zone align with the Periadriatic Fault, a geometry that allows for the eastward lateral extrusion of the Alpine-Carpathian-Pannonian (ALCAPA) Mega-Unit. The Mid-Hungarian Fault Zone accommodated simultaneous strike-perpendicular shortening and strike-slip movements, concomitant with strike-parallel extension. (2) The Mid-Hungarian Fault Zone is also the locus of a <b>former</b> <b>plate</b> boundary transforming opposed subduction polarities between Alps (including Western Carpathians) and Dinarides. (3) The ALCAPA Mega-Unit was affected by 290 km extension and fits into an area W of present-day Budapest in its restored position, while the Tisza-Dacia Mega-Unit was affected by up to 180 km extension during its emplacement into the Carpathian embayment. (4) The external Dinarides experienced Neogene shortening of over 200 km in the south, contemporaneous with dextral wrench movements in the internal Dinarides and the easterly adjacent Carpatho-Balkan orogen. (5) NS convergence between the European and Adriatic plates amounts to some 200 km at a longitude of 14 ° E, in line with post- 20 Ma subduction of Adriatic lithosphere underneath the Eastern Alps, corroborating the discussion of results based on high-resolution teleseismic tomography. The displacement of the Adriatic Plate indenter led to a change in subduction polarity along a transect through the easternmost Alps and to substantial Neogene shortening in the eastern Southern Alps and external Dinarides. While we confirm that slab-pull and rollback of oceanic lithosphere subducted beneath the Carpathians triggered back-arc extension in the Pannonian Basin and much of the concomitant folding and thrusting in the Carpathians, we propose that the rotational displacement of this indenter provided a second important driving force for the severe Neogene modifications of the Alpine-Carpathian-Dinaridic orogenic system...|$|E

The heat required is from the mantle, mainly from internal heating and conduction into recycled fragments. The magnitude of magmatism appears to reflect the fertility, not the absolute temperature, of the asthenosphere. I attribute the chemical heterogeneity of the upper mantle to subduction of young plates, aseismic ridges and seamount chains, and to delamination of the lower continental crust. These heterogeneities eventually warm up past the melting point of eclogite and become buoyant low-velocity diapirs that undergo further adiabatic decompression melting as they encounter thin or spreading regions of the lithosphere. The heat required for the melting of cold subducted and delaminated material is extracted from the essentially infinite heat reservoir of the mantle, not the core. Melting in the upper mantle does not requires the instability of a deep thermal boundary layer or high absolute temperatures. Melts from recycled oceanic crust, and seamounts—and possibly even plateaus—pond beneath the lithosphere, particularly beneath basins and suture zones, with locally thin, weak or young lithosphere. The characteristic scale lengths— 150 to 600 km—of variations in bathymetry and magma chemistry, and the variable productivity of volcanic chains, may reflect compositional heterogeneity of the asthenosphere, not the scales of mantle convection or the spacing of hot plumes. High-frequency seismic waves, scattering, coda studies and deep reflection profiles are needed to detect the kind of chemical heterogeneity and small-scale layering predicted from the recycling hypothesis. ...|$|E
