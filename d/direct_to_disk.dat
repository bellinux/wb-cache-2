The integrity of the signal chain is very important, typically each of the instruments used are fully calibrated in a lab once per year, and any given setup is calibrated as a whole once per day.|$|R
40|$|RIO is a {{multimedia}} object server which manages {{a set of}} parallel disks and supports real-time data delivery with statistical delay guarantees. RIO uses random data allocation on disks combined with partial replication to achieve load balance and high performance. In this paper we analyze the performance of RIO when the set of <b>disks</b> used <b>to</b> store data blocks is not homogeneous, having both different bandwidths and different storage capacities. The basic problem to be addressed for heterogeneous configurations is that, on average, the fraction of the load <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> each <b>disk</b> is proportional <b>to</b> the amount of data stored on it, {{which may not be}} proportional <b>to</b> the <b>disk</b> bandwidth. This may cause some <b>disks</b> <b>to</b> be overloaded, with long queues and delays, even though bandwidth is available on other disks. This reduces the system throughput or increases the delay bound that can be guaranteed. This problem arises whenever the bandwidth to space ratio (BSR) is not uniform across all disks.

Since the CPU is constantly listening for Touch-tones from Fred, his command causes the CPU <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> the <b>Disk</b> Controller <b>to</b> stop playing the message.

50|$|A small, {{personal}} {{recording studio}} {{is sometimes called}} a project studio or home studio. Such studios often cater to specific needs of an individual artist, or are used as a non-commercial hobby.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} on the {{formation}} of magnetically levitating accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). The structure of these disks is calculated by numerically modeling tidal disruption of magnetized interstellar gas clouds. We find that the resulting disks are entirely supported by the pressure of the magnetic fields against the component of gravitational force <b>directed</b> perpendicular <b>to</b> the <b>disks.</b> The magnetic field shows ordered large-scale geometry that remains stable for the duration of our numerical experiments extending over 10 % of the disk lifetime. Strong magnetic pressure allows high accretion rate and inhibits disk fragmentation. This in combination with the repeated feeding of magnetized molecular clouds to an SMBH yields a possible solution to the long-standing puzzle of black hole growth in the centers of galaxies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Data {{movement}} within {{high performance}} environ-ments {{can be a}} large bottleneck to the overall performance of programs. With the addition of continuous storage and usage of older data, the back end storage is becoming a larger problem than the improving network and computational nodes. This has led us to develop a Distributed Shared <b>Disk</b> Cache, <b>DiSK,</b> <b>to</b> reduce the dependence on these back end storage systems. With DiSK requested files will be distributed across nodes {{in order to reduce}} the amount of requests <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the archives. <b>DiSK</b> has two key components. One is a Distributed Metadata Management, DIMM, scheme that allows a centralized manager to access what data is available in the system. This is accomplished through the use of a counter-based bloomfilter with locality checks in order to reduce false positives and false negatives. The second component is a method of replication called Differentiable Replication, DiR. The novelty of DiR is that the requirements of the files and capabilities of underlying nodes are taken into consideration for replication. This allows for a varying degree of replication depending on the file. This customization of DiSK yields better performance than the conventional archive system. I...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} empirical {{experience on}} a scalable, high-performance storage with two existing low-cost technologies. One technology is Ethernet-Attached Disks (E-AD) which are iSCSI-like disks but with low cost controllers. Another is Network File System (NFS) {{which is an}} open standard supported through open source. In particular, NFS version 4. 0 (NFSv 4. 0) has been the de-facto distributed file system protocol for generations. Unfortunately, {{in this age of}} mass data, scalability of NFSv 4. 0 has become an issue. The NFS community has developed the pNFS protocol that takes advantage of parallel accesses to the pool of storage, and announced NFS version 4. 1 including the pNFS protocol. We evaluated the scalability and performance of our storage system under various environments and benchmarks. The results show that NFSv 4. 1 has substantial benefits on large I/O units due <b>to</b> <b>direct</b> <b>disk</b> access and parallelismclos...|$|R

40|$|The buffer cache {{plays an}} {{essential}} role in smoothing the gap between the upper-level computational components and the lower-level storage devices. A good buffer cache management scheme should be beneficial to not only the computational components, but also to the storage components by reducing disk I/Os. Existing cache replacement algorithms are well optimized for disks in normal mode, but inefficient under faulty scenarios, such as a parity-based disk array with faulty <b>disk(s).</b> <b>To</b> address this issue, we propose a novel asymmetric buffer cache replacement strategy, named Victim (or faulty) Disk(s) First (VDF) cache, to improve the reliability and performance of a storage system consisting of a buffer cache and disk arrays. The basic idea is to give higher priority to cache the blocks on the faulty disks when the disk array fails, thus reducing the I/Os <b>directed</b> <b>to</b> the faulty <b>disks.</b> <b>To</b> verify the effectiveness of the VDF cache, we have integrated VDF into two popular cache algorithms LFU and LRU, named VDF-LFU and VDF-LRU, respectively. We have conducted extensive simulations as well as a prototype implementation. The simulation results show that VDF-LFU can reduce <b>disk</b> I/Os <b>to</b> surviving <b>disks</b> by up <b>to</b> 42. 3 % and VDF-LRU can reduce those by up to 36. 2 %. Our measurement results also show that VDF-LFU can speed up the online recovery by up to 46. 3 % under a spare-rebuilding mode with online reconstruction, or improve the maximum system service rate by up to 47. 7 % under a degraded mode without a reconstruction workload. Similarly, VDF-LRU can speed up the online recovery by up to 34. 6 %, or improve the system service rate by up to 28. 4 %. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Network {{virtualization}} {{allows the}} development of systems with several virtual routers (VR) over the same physical router. Each virtual router can execute, at the same time, different protocol stacks without disrupting the coexisting routers. The main purpose of this work is to analyze Xen capabilities and limitations and compare its efficiency with native solutions. Tests are performed in order to isolate possible bottlenecks and see how each mechanism provided by Xen can impact in performance. I. OVERVIEW Xen provides an architecture capable of supporting virtual routers. It offers an high flexibility framework to build virtualized systems, {{with the price of}} sacrificing some of its performance. In the Xen architecture, a layer called Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM) is spawned between the VRs and the real hardware. This layer is responsible for multiplexing the hardware access among all VRs, by the advent of an scheduler, that must decide which VR can access the hardware at each time. An abstraction of network access is created by a complex I/O mechanism. All these implementations are susceptible to bugs and misbehaviors that can lead to performance loss [2]. Xen architecture also includes a privileged virtual machine, called Domain 0, that has <b>direct</b> access <b>to</b> <b>disk</b> and network hardware and aids the VMM on I/O procedures. Domain 0 develops {{an important role in the}} behavior of the virtual routers, because it mediates the access between them and the real I/O device. II. TESTBED We develop a testbed to evaluate the performance of different forwarding elements. Our testbed is composed of a traffic generator machine (TG), a traffic receiver machine (TR) and a traffic forwarder machine (TF) that interconnects TG and TR. Tests are performed in order to compare TF forwarding performance running either Xen or native Linux. III. PARTIAL RESULTS The first performed test analyzes the influence of Xen mechanisms on the response time of TR.
