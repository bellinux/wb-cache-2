5000|$|Another {{especially}} controversial {{aspect of}} female perpetrated IPV is {{the theory of}} [...] "battered husband syndrome." [...] In light {{of the findings of}} the U.S. National Family Violence Survey in 1975, Suzanne K. Steinmetz wrote an article in 1977 in which she coined the term as a correlative to [...] "battered wife syndrome." [...] Steinmetz conducted several empirical investigations prior to writing her article. Using a broad-based non-representative sample of fifty-four couples, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 47% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 43%. She further found that while 39% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> thrown objects, 31% of wives had done likewise; 31% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> pushed or shoved their partner, compared to 32% of wives; 20% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives, 20% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives with an object, 10% of wives <b>had</b> hit their <b>husbands</b> with an object. In another study, using a sample of fifty-two Canadian college students, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 23% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 21%. Further investigation found that 21% of both <b>husbands</b> and wives <b>had</b> thrown objects; 17% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> pushed or shoved, compared to 13% of wives; 13% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives, 13% of wives had hit their husbands; 10% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives with an object, 12% of wives <b>had</b> hit their <b>husbands</b> with an object. In a third study, using a random sample of ninety-four people, Steinmetz found male perpetrated IPV at a rate of 32% and female perpetrated IPV at a rate of 28%. Further investigation found that 31% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> thrown objects compared to 25% of wives; 22% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> pushed or shoved, compared to 18% of wives; 17% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives, 12% of wives had hit their husbands; 12% of <b>husbands</b> <b>had</b> hit their wives with an object, 14% of wives <b>had</b> hit their <b>husbands</b> with an object.|$|R

5|$|Following Ruland's {{departure}} in 1863, the Queen {{looked for}} a husband for Helena. However, as a middle child, {{the prospect of a}} powerful alliance with a European royal house was low.

Furthermore, Victoria insisted that Helena's future <b>husband</b> <b>had</b> to be prepared to live near the Queen, thus keeping her daughter nearby. Her choice eventually fell on Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein; however, the match was politically awkward, and caused a severe breach within the royal family.|$|E
