40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the issue of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in the context of parental upbringing. This paper is based on {{qualitative}} research and analysis of eleven semi- structured interviews with parents who bring up at least two children of different sex. I focus on the relation between identified <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in upbringing and parenting style. I also focus on <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> attitudes of fathers and mothers within individual families. On the basis of the interviews analysis I conclude that <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in upbringing and overall optics of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> are present in all families, regardless of parenting style. I am finding that differences among families with diverse parenting styles are primarily in the degree of awareness of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> attitudes and the degree of active transmission of these attitudes to their children...|$|R
40|$|The {{process of}} expressing what is {{masculine}} promotes {{attitudes and behaviors}} that can discourage men from seeking help, contributing to numerous health issues in males. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore how personally endorsed <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> vs. <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> attitudes impacted help-seeking behavior. In the current study, female and male adults completed challenging puzzle tasks, recalled previous health help-seeking behavior, and completed sex-typed measures. Females utilized personally endorsed <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> more during the puzzle tasks, while males utilized both personally endorsed <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> as well as <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> attitudes. When males recalled health-related events, however, personally endorsed feminine stereotypes predicted previous instances of help-seeking, suggesting a possible difference in the utilization of pathways during recalled vs. observable help-seeking behaviors. Findings demonstrated that personal and attitudinal pathways of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> play distinct roles for males and females in predicting help-seeking behavior...|$|R
40|$|Although {{parents may}} {{represent}} influential sources of children’s <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> to date no study has directly investigated {{the relations between}} parents’ and children’s <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> regarding academic abilities. Aiming at filling this gap, {{in the present study}} parents’ and their young children’s <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about math and language were assessed using both explicit and implicit measures for each member of the family. Sixty-eight Italian 6 -year-olds, their mothers, and their fathers (a) performed an Implicit Association Test designed to assess implicit <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about math and language, and (b) completed a measure of the relevant explicit stereotypes. Fathers’, but not mothers’, implicit stereotypes predicted children’s implicit and explicit stereotypes. Conversely, no predictive role emerged for parents’ explicit <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> about math and language. Results are discussed also in relation to the role of fathers as targets of interventions to prevent academic <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> within the family...|$|R
50|$|Gender {{stereotypes}} and other culturally-embedded representations of genderDrawing on social role theory (Eagly, 1987), and the stereotype content model (Fiske, Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002), expectation state theory argues that, when deciding (unconsciously) {{who is most}} instrumental to achieving the goal, people rely {{on the content of}} {{stereotypes and}} status beliefs. Women are stereotypically communal and lower status than men.There has been empirical support for an implicit hierarchy <b>gender</b> <b>stereotype.</b> Mast (2004) found that the association between men and hierarchical and between woman and egalitarian was stronger than the associate between men and egalitarian and women and hierarchical. The implicit hierarchy <b>gender</b> <b>stereotype</b> is stronger for men than it is for women, which means men end up with more status and power than women.|$|E

40|$|Background: Reinforcing <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> still {{occurs in}} toy {{advertisements}} {{even though it}} is stated that <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> in marketing is a public concern. Parents perception of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> will further influence how children act according to gender, which is why it is of importance to explore how parents perceive <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyped</b> advertising towards their children and how this is linked to socially responsible marketing. Research questions: RQ: What are the perceptions of Swedish parents on <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertisements targeted at children, and how can this be linked to socially responsible marketing? SQ 1 : What are the perceptions of parents on advertisements towards children where <b>stereotyped</b> <b>gender</b> roles are being reinforced? SQ 2 : What are the perceptions of parents on advertisements towards children where <b>stereotyped</b> <b>gender</b> roles are being challenged? Purpose: The purpose of this research is to link the idea of socially responsible marketing with <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> and advertising targeting children. Methodology: Using visual materials as stimuli in semi-structured focused interviews. Conclusion: The empirical investigation revealed that parents perceived <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertising as harmful to society, particularly to children. Socially responsible marketing should therefore reflect more on this subject and portray both girls and boys sharing colors, attributes and toys...|$|R

Gender differences in math performance {{may be influenced}} by stereotypes held by adolescent girls and stereotypes passed down by their parents. Mothers' and daughters' <b>gender</b> and math <b>stereotypes</b> {{have been shown to be}} correlated in previous research. Past research has also found gender differences in actual math performance. This study looked at the correlation between mothers' <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> and their daughters' math stereotypes as well as with their daughters' math performance. The possible mediating role(s) of subjective task value and competence beliefs were also investigated. The participants in this study were adolescent girls and their mothers (N = 100). <b>Gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> of mothers, stereotypes of daughters, daughters' competence beliefs, subjective task value, and actual math scores were collected via a take home survey given to the girls at school after parental permission was obtained. Correlations were found between mothers' and daughters' <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> as well as between daughters' <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> and their math scores. The mediation hypotheses were not supported. <b>Gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> were found to be correlated with several demographic variables and daughters' math performance was negatively correlated with the mothers being married.

In the paper we have identified the content of road users’ gender stereotypes; analyzed the behaviour of male and female drivers, pinpointing a number of gender-specific behavioural features; demonstrated that male and female driving differ from each other in terms of speed, intensity and roughness; and identified the conditions and mechanisms underlying the actualization of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> Based on video and audio materials, we have found that drivers’ gender-specific behavioural features are perceivable to road users: such features trigger the actualization of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> as attributive schemes, which determine the interaction between road users, while also laying the foundation for <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes...</b>|$|R

40|$|A very {{prominent}} limiting factor in modern society {{is the presence}} of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes.</b> Previous research has identified numerous character traits that are associated with each gender, as well as ways in which <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> negatively affect individuals.

40|$|This study aims to {{investigate}} {{the effects of the}} use of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertising on a brand. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to examine the topic of stereotypes in advertising and discover the reason for the continued use of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertising. This paper aims to explore whether or not there is a purpose behind the use of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> and explore how consumers respond to advertising campaigns of this nature. This will be achieved by comparing past academic studies and primary research conducted by the author on this paper. Having conducted an in-depth study into the literature on the topic a study was conducted based on this research. This study used a quantitative approach using an online questionnaire which was created and distributed by the author. This questionnaire was constructed with all of the objectives and sub-objects in mind in order to gain a better insight into how consumers actually respond to this issue. The literature found there was a great divide between people who cared about the use of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in advertising and those who were either indifferent and those who liked their use. This was quite similar to the results found from the survey. Although opinions were divided on the reaction to the use of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes,</b> it was clear that the use of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> affect a brand’s image and may even go as far as stopping people from buying their products. This observation is something that marketers need to be made aware of for future actions. From the literature there is a difference in opinion amongst scholars on the subject of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> in advertising. Furthermore the effect of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> on brand equity was not examined in-depth. The link between <b>gender</b> <b>stereotyping</b> and brand equity on the contradicts what other scholars have reported on the subject it as unsurprising that the results agreed with some of it.

50|$|Consequently, that <b>gender</b> <b>stereotype</b> filter {{leads to}} a lack of fair {{evaluation}} and, in turn, to fewer women occupying higher paying positions. Gender stereotypes contain women at certain, lower levels; getting trapped within the glass ceiling. While the number of women in the workforce occupying management positions is slowly increasing, women currently fill only 2.5% of the higher managerial positions in the United States. The fact that most women are being allocated to occupations that pay less, is often cited as a contributor to the existing gender pay gap.|$|E
50|$|Implicit {{stereotypes}} can {{be reduced}} by exposure to counterstereotypes. Reading biographies of females in leadership roles (such as Meg Whitman, the CEO of eBay) increases females’ associations between female names and words like leader, determined, and ambitious in a <b>gender</b> <b>stereotype</b> IAT. Attending a women's college (where students are presumably more often exposed to women in leadership positions) reduces associations between leadership and males after one year of schooling. Merely imagining a strong woman reduces implicit association between females and weakness, and imagining storybook princesses increases the implicit association between females and weakness.|$|E

The main objective of the thesis is to find out about their awareness of <b>gender</b> and <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> occurring in social work areas and to characterise the influence of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> during the execution of their duties. The theoretical part includes an introduction explaining the gender issues and general terms related to the given topic including the development of the gender issue within a social and historical context and its interconnection with the present form of social work in the Czech Republic. A definition of the given context represents the basis for {{the second part of the}} thesis dealing with research. Its contents describe the elaboration, analysis and assessment of the executed semi-structured interviews and observations. The author focused on four thematic areas related to the issue of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in terms of accomplished qualitative research, which were later compared to the given observation. The results show a remarkable difference in the perception of <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> by a male social worker and female social workers while dealing with male and female clients and the author of this thesis. Research also demonstrates that the gender issue and <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> assessment in social work with seniors is rather difficult due to different education, as well as different cultural and social periods. The results in the given thesis might be useful for both professionals and the public in order to realize and understand <b>gender</b> and <b>gender</b> <b>stereotypes</b> in social work areas and not only while working with male and female seniors.
