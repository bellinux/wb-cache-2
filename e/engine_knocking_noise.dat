40|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>knock</b> {{has long}} been a well {{recognized}} phenomenon in the automotive industry. Detecting <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> opens up the possibility for an indirect feedback of the engine's internal combustion without installing a pressure transducer inside the cylinder. Knock detection has mainly been used for spark advance control, making it possible to control the engine close to its knock limit in search for the optimal ignition timing. This application has to a lesser extent been applied to lightweight two-stroke engines, which is the focus of this study. The investigation features a modern chainsaw <b>engine</b> whose <b>knock</b> characteristics were first determined with a pressure transducer. The structural vibrations originating from the <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> are filtered out of the signal from a remote located accelerometer. The knock intensity is compared with the signal from the pressure transducer which shows a correlation with an accepted extent between the two sensors. Parameters that affect the knock intensity have also been investigated. These include engine temperature, different types of fuel and ignition timings...|$|R
50|$|LSPI {{events are}} random and infrequent, {{and their effects}} on {{impacted}} vehicles can include very high-pressure spikes, loud <b>knocking</b> <b>noises</b> and sometimes catastrophic engine damage.|$|R
40|$|A {{critical}} {{review of literature}} bearing on the autoignition and detonation-wave theories of spark-ignition <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> and {{on the nature of}} gas vibrations associated with combustion and knock results in the conclusion that neither the autoignition theory nor the detonation-wave theory is an adequate explanation of spark-ignition <b>engine</b> <b>knock.</b> A knock theory is proposed, combining the autoignition and detonation-wave theories, introducing the idea that the detonation wave develops in autoignited or afterburning gases, and ascribing comparatively low-pitched heavy knocks to autoignition but high-pitched pinging knocks to detonation waves with the possibility of combinations of the two types of knock. Prepared at the Aircraft Engine Research Laboratory, Cleveland, Ohio. Originally issued as NACA as Advance Restricted Report E 6 C 22 (April 1946). NACA Wartime Report E- 238.

50|$|An {{antiknock}} {{agent is}} a gasoline additive {{used to reduce}} <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> and increase the fuel's octane rating by raising the temperature and pressure at which auto-ignition occurs.|$|R
50|$|Water {{injection}} {{was used}} historically {{to increase the}} power output of military aviation engines for short durations, such as dogfights or takeoff. However {{it has also been}} used in motor sport and notably in drag racing. In Otto cycle engines, the cooling effects of water injection also enables greater compression ratios by reducing <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> (detonation). Alternately, this reduction in <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> in Otto cycle engines means that some applications gain significant performance when water injection is used in conjunction with a supercharger, turbocharger, or modifications such as aggressive ignition timing.|$|R
50|$|Triacetin {{can also}} be used as a fuel {{additive}} as an antiknock agent which can reduce <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> in gasoline, and to improve cold and viscosity properties of biodiesel.|$|R
50|$|Higher {{compression}} ratios will however make gasoline engines {{subject to}} <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> (also known as detonation) if lower octane-rated fuel is used. This can reduce efficiency or damage the <b>engine</b> if <b>knock</b> sensors are not present {{to modify the}} ignition timing. However, knock sensors have been a requirement of the OBD-II specification used in 1996 model year vehicles and newer.|$|R
5000|$|Restructured pistons - A {{more compact}} piston {{prevents}} residual gas accumulation {{which in turn}} suppresses <b>engine</b> <b>knocking.</b> In addition, oil retention is improved thus reducing friction and increases fuel efficiency.|$|R
50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Diesel engines {{operate on the}} {{principle}} of compression ignition, so that a fuel which resists autoignition will cause late ignition, which will also lead to <b>engine</b> <b>knock.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Water {{injection}} {{which is}} a method for cooling the combustion chambers of engines by adding water to the incoming fuel-air mixture, allowing for greater compression ratios and reduced <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> (detonation).|$|R
5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl {{is used as}} an additive in {{unleaded gasoline}} to boost octane rating and reduce <b>engine</b> <b>knocking.</b> The manganese in this unusual organometallic compound is in the +1 oxidation state.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Engine</b> <b>knock</b> {{control is}} used to allow the {{ignition}} timing to continually approach the point of detonation. This is {{the point where the}} engine will produce the most motive power, as well as the highest efficiency.|$|R
5000|$|The mixture {{known as}} {{gasoline}} or petrol, {{when used in}} high compression internal combustion engines, {{has a tendency to}} knock (also called [...] "pinging" [...] or [...] "pinking") and/or to ignite early before the correctly timed spark occurs (pre-ignition, refer to <b>engine</b> <b>knocking).</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "Octane" [...] is colloquially {{used as a}} {{short form}} of [...] "octane rating" [...] (an index of a fuel's ability to resist <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> at high compression, which is a {{characteristic}} of octane's branched-chain isomers, especially iso-octane), particularly in the expression [...] "high octane." ...|$|R
5000|$|Automatic Performance Control (APC) was {{the first}} <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> and boost control system that was {{introduced}} on turbo charged Saab H engines in 1982 and was fitted to all subsequent 900 Turbos through 1993 (and 1994 convertibles), as well as 9000 Turbos through 1989.|$|R
50|$|The Scaled Hammer Action II {{has been}} {{described}} as being harder, more substantial and heavier compared to the previous versions. It is also widely criticized for its characteristic <b>knocking</b> <b>noises</b> when played at medium to high velocities, and considered as being heavier than a generic acoustic piano keys.|$|R
50|$|Methanol is (In {{automotive}} terms) hygroscopic, {{meaning it}} will absorb water vapor {{directly from the}} atmosphere. Because absorbed water dilutes the fuel value of the methanol (although it suppresses <b>engine</b> <b>knock),</b> and may cause phase separation of methanol-gasoline blends, containers of methanol fuels must be kept tightly sealed.|$|R
50|$|Unintentional {{detonation}} when deflagration {{is desired}} {{is a problem}} in some devices. In internal combustion engines it is called <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> or pinging or pinking, and it causes a loss of power and excessive heating of certain components. In firearms, it may cause catastrophic and potentially lethal failure.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{the torque}} control problem for {{spark-ignition}} engines is considered. The {{objective is to}} provide good output torque tracking with minimum fuel consumption, while avoiding <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> and misre. To this end, three control strategies are proposed: a feed-forward controller with recalibrated engine maps, a PI control scheme and a model predictive controller. For the model predictive control strategy, a simplied air-path engine model is developed based on the Wiener model structure. The proposed controllers are shown to provide safe engine operation by avoiding <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> and misre. The performance of each control strategy is evaluated over a specic driving cycle and compared with a baseline control strategy. Simulation results show up to 40 % performance improvement for the model predictive control strategy {{as compared to the}} baseline strategy...|$|R
50|$|Ethylbenzene {{is added}} to {{gasoline}} as an anti-knock agent, meaning it reduces <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> and increase the octane rating. Ethylbenzene is often found in other manufactured products, including pesticides, cellulose acetate, synthetic rubber, paints, and inks. Used in the recovery of natural gas, ethylbenzene may be injected into the ground.|$|R
50|$|First, {{a higher}} {{mechanical}} compression ratio (or, with super-charged or turbo-charged engines, maximum combustion pressure) {{may be used}} for better thermodynamic efficiency. Since fuel is not present in the combustion chamber until virtually the point at which combustion is required to begin, there is no risk of pre-ignition or <b>engine</b> <b>knock.</b>|$|R

25|$|Automotive engine {{management}} systems use piezoelectric transducers to detect <b>Engine</b> <b>knock</b> (Knock Sensor, KS), {{also known as}} detonation, at certain hertz frequencies. A piezoelectric transducer is also used in fuel injection systems to measure manifold absolute pressure (MAP sensor) to determine engine load, and ultimately the fuel injectors milliseconds of on time.|$|R
50|$|The {{compression}} ratio in a gasoline (petrol)-powered engine will usually {{not be much}} higher than 10:1 due to potential <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> (detonation) and not lower than 6:1. Some production automotive engines built for high performance from 1955-1972, used high-octane leaded gasoline or '5 star' to allow {{compression ratio}}s as high as 13.0:1.|$|R

40|$|A {{critical}} {{review of literature}} bearing on the autoignition and detonation-wave theories of spark-ignition <b>engine</b> <b>knock</b> and {{on the nature of}} gas vibrations associated with combustion and knock results in the conclusion that neither the autoignition theory nor the detonation-wave theory is an adequate explanation of spark-ignition <b>engine</b> <b>knock.</b> A knock theory is proposed, combining the autoignition and detonation-wave theories, which introduces the idea that the detonation wave develops in autoignited or after-burning gases, and ascribes comparatively low-pitched heavy knocks to autoignition but high-pitched pinging knocks to detonation waves with the possibility of combinations of the two types of knocks. Analysis of five shots of knocking combustion, taken with the NACA high-speed motion-picture camera at the rate of 40, 000 photographs per second reveals propagation speeds ranging from 3250 to more than 5500 feet per second. The range of propagation speeds from 3250 to more than 5500 feet per second is held to be considered with the proposed combined theory but not with either the simple autoignition theory or the simple detonation-wave theory...|$|R
50|$|Gas {{is mixed}} with air by a common mixer {{installed}} before turbocharger(s). Gas flow is controlled by a throttle valve, which is electronically operated by the special control system according to the required engine output and speed. In order to avoid <b>knocking</b> of the <b>engine,</b> <b>knocking</b> detector/controller is installed, thus enabling engine operation at the most efficient gas/diesel ratio.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a discussion of}} three potential sources of error in recording <b>engine</b> <b>knocking</b> which are: the natural oscillation of the membrane, the shock process between test contacts, and the danger of burned contacts. Following this discussion, the paper calls attention to various results which make the bouncing-pin indicator appear fundamentally unsuitable for recording knock phenomena...|$|R
5000|$|As a fuel additive, {{polyisobutylene}} has detergent properties. When {{added to}} diesel fuel, it resists fouling of fuel injectors, leading to reduced hydrocarbon and particulate emissions. It is blended with other detergents and additives {{to make a}} [...] "detergent package" [...] that is added to gasoline and diesel fuel to resist buildup of deposits and <b>engine</b> <b>knock.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{rotary valve}} {{combustion}} engine possesses several significant advantages over the conventional assemblies, including significantly higher compression ratios and rpm, meaning more power, {{a much more}} compact and light-weight cylinder head, and reduced complexity, meaning higher reliability and lower cost.
