25|$|By {{the will}} of my {{commander}} in chief, I have come to release the ownership over the Talysh regions {{from the hands of}} the Persians and therefore must take Lankaran. Knowing you are a valiant and prudent leader, I consider it necessary to warn that your resistance will be in vain. Even though you may be a great military leader, but you are no better than Abbas Mirza, who lost at Aslanduz and with that ten thousand soldiers, 500 men as prisoners, all the banners, weapons of which the troops don't have to their disposal right now. As it was at Aslanduz, where here barely escaped along with the 20th horsemen regiment and fled to Tabriz, while he had thirty thousand men at his disposal, and we had just two thousand men. Warriors of the great almighty in the world the Russian emperor crashed Abbas Mirza to pieces, and now they are located here, at the Talysh Khanate. So, when Abbas Mirza could not resist our victorious weapons, despite the fact that his troops outnumbered ours by fifteen times, you reflect that you won't be able either to inflict us a mortal blow here; so <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> agree to voluntarily surrender the fortress to avoid harmful and unnecessary bloodshed, sparing both Abbas Mirza's as well as my warriors. Consider of what you will reach by following sanity, namely saving lives, dignity, and both your property and all affiliated parties' properties in this conflict; otherwise, you will lose everything, if you won't attend the voice of common sense. But it is my duty to tell you, as you will be the one to choose; only I shall be justified in front of God and humanity. I'm ordered not to bombard yet by this letter until I receive response and receipt within three hours.|$|E
2500|$|The {{guests at}} the hotel {{typically}} are comic foils to Basil's anger and outbursts. Guest characters in each episode provide different characteristics (working class, promiscuous, foreign) that he cannot stand. Requests both reasonable and impossible test his temper. Even the afflicted annoy him, as for example in the episode [...] "Communication Problems", revolving around the havoc caused by the frequent misunderstandings between the staff and the hard-of-hearing Mrs. Richards. By the end, Basil faints just {{at the mention of}} her name. This episode is typical of the show's careful weaving of humorous situations through comedy cross-talk. The show also uses mild black humour at times, notably when Basil is forced to hide a dead body and in Basil's comments about Sybil ("Did you ever see that film, How to Murder Your Wife? ... Awfully good. I saw it six times.") and to the guests ("May <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> consider moving to a hotel closer to the sea? Or preferably in it.").|$|E
6000|$|... "It's all straight, and I hope you're satisfied. A farmer, aren't you? May <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have mistaken your profession?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. It was {{to prevent}} any such {{contingency}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should bicycle to Kingham Manor. When I informed the ladies and gentlemen that I had found the key, and it was borne in upon them <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were having <b>that</b> long ride for nothing, their animosity vanished immediately, {{to be replaced by}} cordial amusement. There was much laughter." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{same idea}} {{eventually}} {{served as the}} basis of the proposal for resolving the controversy of Tossa de Mar, as remembers the responsible after some 19 years after the event on the site of Anubis, an association for the protection of animals in Spain, which she belongs: [...] "The Major, Mr Adolf Hitler, wanted to stop the scandal, and ask me how, <b>I</b> <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> declare the anti-bullfighting city." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ferguson {{stroked his}} long lean jaw. [...] "No, no," [...] said he; [...] "all <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> find Mr. Wilding {{work to do}} elsewhere." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Is {{that not}} rather a {{question}} for you to consider? <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had better speak to your daughter; just a hint, you know, just a hint." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{you must}} not let me {{influence}} you in any way. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> go on your line and I on mine. We can compare notes afterwards, and each will supplement the other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course there}} will be a grand feast at the Royal Palace on Ozma's {{birthday}}, and all our friends will be present. So <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> make a fine big birthday cake of Ozma, and surround it with candles." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is a {{beautiful}} woman, nevertheless," [...] continued de Batz with a smile. [...] "During the next act, my good St. Just, <b>I</b> would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> open your eyes {{as well as your}} ears." ...|$|R
60|$|AUSTIN. Then, sir (with {{his hand}} upon the bell), this {{conversation}} becomes impossible. You have me at too gross a disadvantage; and, {{as you are}} a gentleman and respect another, <b>I</b> would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> retire.|$|R
6000|$|... "I believe, Prince," [...] he said, [...] "that no {{good can}} come of any further conference {{between you and}} me. We {{understand}} one another too well. Might <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> therefore <b>that</b> <b>you</b> permit me to ring?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well. Gomez {{is waiting}} for {{instructions}} and probably knows that the messenger is a foreigner. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> impersonate him. The guards will let you pass, and Gomez will, no doubt, receive you alone. Then you must try to extort an order for your friend's release." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be so good as to remember," [...] Mr. John Zant answered, [...] "that the {{decision}} rests with me, as the lady's relative. I am sensible of the honor which your visit confers on me. But {{the time has}} been unhappily chosen. Forgive me if <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will do well to retire." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are on {{the point}} of selling the No. 2 patents to Belgium, Italy, etc. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> stop those {{negotiations}} and put those people off two or three months. They are anxious now, they will not be less anxious then--just the reverse; people always want a thing that is denied them.|$|E
50|$|In {{your work}} of suppression, <b>I</b> would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> keep your mind on these insects. Devise {{protection}} by window screens, in-door (illegible) abandonment of barrels, tubs, etc. {{about the house}} that contain water in which they breed abundantly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that the public {{interest}} will not allow me to answer your question. Since, however, Lord Wellington himself is present, <b>I</b> would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> ask his lordship whether I am {{to give you the}} information you require." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Evidently Foy has a {{story to}} tell," [...] said Adrian wearily, [...] "and the sooner he rids his mind of it the sooner {{he will be able}} to wash. <b>I</b> <b>suggest,</b> Foy, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should begin at the beginning." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you only}} {{open your mouth}} to show your ignorance, Oliver, you had better keep it shut. The men who carried stone axes had {{advanced}} far beyond the state of savagery. But <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had better give Doctor Adams a chance of telling his story, after which you can criticize." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Eccles {{was going}} to tell us about it when you entered the room. I think, Watson, a brandy and soda would do him no harm. Now, sir, <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> take no notice of this {{addition}} to your audience, and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have done had you never been interrupted." ...|$|E
60|$|HOTCHKISS [gaily] Or {{take you}} {{as a matter of}} course? [Swiftly to the Bishop] We must get her out of this: it's dangerous. [Aloud to her] May <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shall be Anthony's devil and the Bishop's saint and my adored Polly? [Slipping behind her, he picks up her hand from her lap and kisses it over her shoulder].|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{gentleman who}} made this charge," [...] I went on, [...] "seems {{to me to be}} in a very {{uncertain}} condition. Might <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that,</b> before <b>you</b> commit yourself to taking these people to the police station, you just make sure he really has been robbed of his pocketbook?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In that case, your Grace, {{since you}} have {{yourself}} stated that any unhappiness in your married life was caused by his presence <b>I</b> would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> make such amends as you can to the Duchess, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> try to resume those relations which have been so unhappily interrupted." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They did. You {{might have}} put it more harshly with truth. But <b>I</b> want to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{let me take a}} share in your venture." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Hannaway Wells's advice is, without doubt, {{technically}} correct," [...] Julian admitted, [...] "but {{the whole}} subject is too great, {{and the issues}} involved too awful for etiquette or even propriety to count. It is for you, sir, to decide {{what is best for}} the country. You commit yourself to nothing by reading the proposals, and <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do not mean," [...] he continued, [...] "to {{propose that}} I shall act as your {{agent in the}} various forms of {{business}} which press upon you, but <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> allow me to do for you exactly what the under-study does for the actor; that is, that you let me take your place when it is inconvenient or impossible for you to take it yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{ought to}} say," [...] {{interrupted}} his visitor, [...] "that {{we all thought}} him, of course, an honourable man until this war, or {{we should not have}} been his friends. He is a dentist," [...] she added, [...] "and, I suppose, may be said to be doing useful work, which makes it difficult. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> go to him to have a tooth out." ...|$|E
60|$|That's not so satisfactory--unless they contradicted one another; {{in which}} case <b>I</b> venture to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have grasped at all events the {{elements}} of the Egyptian problem.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I admit that; indeed, {{you might}} put it more harshly with truth. But <b>I</b> want to <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{let me take}} a share in your venture." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{accompanying}} notes <b>I</b> have <b>suggested</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> vastly {{modify the}} first visit to hell, and leave out the second visit altogether. Nobody would, or ought to print those things. You are not advanced enough in literature to venture upon a matter requiring so much practice. Let {{me show you what}} a man has got to go through: ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good. Then you authorize me to {{tell her}} that she's been mistaken, and there was nothing but a little fun in it? You've no doubt, Katharine, in your own mind? Cassandra is in our charge, and I don't intend that people should gossip about her. <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should be a little more careful in future. Invite me to your next entertainment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Fentolin," [...] he said, [...] "I {{hope that}} you will not think that I am officious or in any way abusing your hospitality, but I cannot help {{suggesting}} that as Dr. Sarson is purely your household physician, the relatives of this man Dunster might be better satisfied if some second opinion were called in. Might <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> telephone to Norwich for a surgeon?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Sabin emerged {{through the}} swing door. [...] "Your discretion, my dear Lucille," [...] he said, smiling, [...] "is excellent. The place is indeed {{better than it}} seems, and Annette's cookery may be all that the Prince claims. Yet I think I know better places for a luncheon party, and the {{ventilation}} {{is not of the}} best. May <b>I</b> <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> come with me instead to the Milan?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I don't think <b>that!</b> <b>I</b> merely <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't idealize {{the victim}} in this instance. I dare say she hasn't {{suffered}} {{half as much as}} <b>you</b> have. Remember <b>that</b> she's a person of commonplace traditions, and probably took a simple view of the matter, and let it go as something that could not be helped." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. Not probable; {{certainly}} not; but it's possible. Great {{interest will}} probably be made. If I might venture to advise your lordship, <b>I</b> would <b>suggest</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should discuss the matter with his grace next week. I {{have no doubt that}} your wishes, if made known and backed by his grace, would be paramount with Lord ----." ...|$|R
