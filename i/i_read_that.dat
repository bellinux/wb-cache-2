500|$|Following its release, {{there was}} media {{speculation}} that Spears {{had written a}} song {{as a response to}} [...] "Cry Me a River"; she denied the rumors, explaining, [...] "You know, it's funny. <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> I wrote this song and I wrote these lyrics and that's not my style. I would never do that." [...] Annet Artani, who co-wrote Spears' 2003 song [...] "Everytime", stated that the song was written as a response to [...] "Cry Me a River". When asked during an interview with Diane Sawyer on PrimeTime in 2003, if [...] "Everytime" [...] was about Timberlake, Spears responded, [...] "I'll let the song speak for itself." ...|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, but I {{think it is very}} important with people who are dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E
500|$|The group {{wrote and}} {{performed}} children's music {{that was different}} from {{what had been done}} previously; as Cook stated, [...] "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music". [...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the first}} guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. I think it would be really nice if in 15years <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> somebody got into guitar playing because of [...] Wiggles". [...] In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band [...] "they got into".|$|E

500|$|Many of the {{original}} characters graduated from McKinley High {{at the end of}} the third season. Murphy said, [...] "We didn't want to have a show where they were in high school for eight years. We really wanted to be true to that experience." [...] Adult characters played by Matthew Morrison and Jane Lynch would remain to provide continuity to the series, though according to Falchuk, some students—Rachel, Finn and Kurt in particular—would likely remain on the show after they graduate. In May 2012, Murphy said that just because a character on the show graduates high school does not mean that they are leaving, [...] "A lot of people have been writing Dianna's off the show, Amber's off the show — they're not off the show. I think Amber was talking about that bittersweet feeling of, 'I'll never be in the choir room with that exact group of people.' At least that's what she told me ... When <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> [...] I said, 'I think people will misconstrue that.' She's excited about where her character is going. They all are. I wanted to do the right thing by all of them." [...] He then continued: [...] "They're all coming back. Anyone who is a regular is coming back. Everyone said yes." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the same}} time Shakira's album evoked sharp {{criticism}} {{by a number of}} authors. David Browne from Entertainment Weekly, for instance, called the album a [...] "the ultimate in crossover nightmares" [...] and opined that Shakira's incorporation of different musical genres made it sound confusing, saying [...] "Its wan ska-pop, faux-country ballads, and generic rock barely betray a Spanish accent or any musical heritage. (She can't decide if she wants to sound like Alanis or Shania)". Matt Cibula from PopMatters gave a more mixed view in his review of Laundry Service; he complimented some of the lyrics of the songs but expressed disappointment in Shakira's production of the album, writing it off as [...] "generic". He felt that the album was [...] "extremely safe" [...] and speculated that the reason behind the album's [...] "generic" [...] sound was due to the Estefans' involvement, saying [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> she's [...] helping you with lyrics and he's [...] 'executive producer', and I hear the unmistakable hum of 'moneymoneymoneymoney' in the background [...]" [...] Ernesto Lechner from Rolling Stone complimented the singer's voice as a [...] "wild and beautiful instrument [...] capable of delivering scorching moments of musical passion," [...] but commented that the involvement of a [...] "battalion of producers and songwriters" [...] led to Shakira sounding [...] "downright silly" [...] on Laundry Service and also criticised [...] "her efforts to spice things up with obvious touches of Latin American folklore." ...|$|E
500|$|Hearst was {{reluctant}} to play a character similar to herself, commenting, [...] "I'd never gone in and done as cameo as myself or anything, and I wouldn't do that. Yes, the college is called Hearst…which I thought was funny, and it's certainly not related to publishing." [...] Hearst had never previously accepted roles where {{she was asked to}} play herself, stating that it was a [...] "pathetic attempt to get attention" [...] when other celebrities played themselves or characters similar to themselves. Hearst had heard of Veronica Mars and seen several episodes prior to her appearance; nevertheless, she still needed to talk to Thomas about the series and her character before agreeing to guest star, commenting that she discovered that the character's background was not exceedingly similar to her own life, as [...] "Selma's situation is nothing like anything I've had to deal with." [...] When reading the script for the first time, Hearst was amused by the fact that her character was the heiress to the [...] "Hearst Mart fortune", comparing it to Walmart; she stated, [...] "when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> in the script, I burst out laughing. It was a spit-take kind of thing. I almost fell over." [...] When asked whether or not the character would become a recurring one, she responded that the idea had not come up in discussions with the crew. However, she stated that she would accept if given the opportunity, and she particularly enjoyed working with Kristen Bell, Enrico Colantoni, and Ed Begley, Jr..|$|E

2500|$|Lewenstein {{also noted}} {{the power of}} the book as a {{recruitment}} tool. Along with Microbe Hunters and The Double Helix, he described Cosmos as one of the [...] "books that people cite as 'Hey, the reason I'm a scientist is because <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> book'."

Political correctness has gone too far." ...|$|E
2500|$|King {{related in}} detail his primary {{inspiration}} for writing horror fiction in his non-fiction Danse Macabre (1981), in a chapter titled [...] "An Annoying Autobiographical Pause". King compares his uncle's successfully dowsing for water using the bough of an apple branch with the sudden realization {{of what he}} wanted to do for a living. That inspiration occurred while browsing through an attic with his elder brother, when King uncovered a paperback version of an H. P. Lovecraft collection of short stories he remembers as The Lurker in the Shadows, that had belonged to his father. King told Barnes & Noble Studios during a 2009 interview, [...] "I knew that I'd found home when <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> book." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Small Demons", {{a website}} that [...] "obsessively maps out {{cultural}} allusions found in books", {{was inspired by}} Borges, according to CEO Valla Vakili: [...] "The inspiration for the name comes from the Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges, specifically a passage in his short story 'Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius'. Borges writes, 'The history of the universe… is the handwriting produced by a Minor god in order to communicate with a Demon.' <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> as, {{the history of the}} universe is all the stories ever told. Minor gods are the storytellers who rule the worlds of their stories. And the Demon is the force that drives the need for stories, the place where author and reader meet. I took 'Minor' and 'Demon' and from there, Small Demons." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 6, 2012, Bryant passed O'Neal for fifth {{place on}} the all-time scoring list. Bryant {{said it was an}} honor because of their championships together. O'Neal congratulated Bryant, saying [...] "I'm proud of him. I'm happy for him. And, most of all, I want to thank him for being a part of the {{greatest}} 1-2 punch ever created, never to be duplicated." [...] Bryant stated on radio the following day that he and O'Neal were never going to last as teammates. Bryant recalled: [...] "There was an interview that I heard Shaq do which he kind of threw down the challenge of me not being able to win without him. After <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that,</b> I said, 'Aw, that's it.' Some comparison that he made with me and Penny Hardaway, and once <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that,</b> I said, 'You know what? I can't finish my career with people saying that. There's no way.'" [...] In 2013, Bryant said that the two [...] "have a really, really good relationship now", calling it [...] "a good lesson for all of us." [...] He said the two had [...] "mutual respect" [...] for each other, while O'Neal commented that they had an [...] "athletic dislike" [...] for each other but [...] "never had a real dislike". That year, the Lakers retired O'Neal's No. 34 during a halftime ceremony. [...] Bryant did not attend the ceremony, but called O'Neal [...] "the most gifted physical specimen I've ever seen play this game" [...] in a recorded video during the event. [...] Questioned about his absence, Bryant told the media, [...] "I appreciate you guys trying to start some stuff for old times' sake." [...] Later, it came out that Bryant had missed the ceremony because he had been receiving treatment from the Lakers' training staff.|$|E
2500|$|Gillespie did {{not serve}} in World War II. At his Selective Service interview, he told the local board, [...] "in this stage of my life here in the United States whose foot has been in my ass?" [...] He was {{thereafter}} classed as 4-F. In 1943, Gillespie joined the Earl Hines band. Composer Gunther Schuller said:" ... In 1943 I heard the great Earl Hines band which had Bird in it {{and all those other}} great musicians. They were playing all the flatted fifth chords and all the modern harmonies and substitutions and Gillespie runs in the trumpet section work. Two years later <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> that was 'bop' and the beginning of modern jazz ... but the band never made recordings." [...] Gillespie said of the Hines band, [...] "eople talk about the Hines band being 'the incubator of bop' and the leading exponents of that music ended up in the Hines band. But people also have the erroneous impression that the music was new. It was not. The music evolved from what went before. It was the same basic music. The difference was in how you got from here to here to here ... naturally each age has got its own shit".|$|E
2500|$|Early in the 2012 presidential campaign, in June 2011, Romney said, [...] "I don't {{speak for}} the {{scientific}} community, of course, but I believe the world's getting warmer. I can't prove that, but I believe based on what <b>I</b> <b>read</b> <b>that</b> the world is getting warmer. And number two, I believe that humans contribute to that. I don't know how much our contribution is to that, because I know {{that there have been}} periods of greater heat and warmth in the past but I believe we contribute to that. And so I think it's important for us to reduce our emissions of pollutants and greenhouse gases that may well be significant contributors to the climate change and the global warming that you're seeing." [...] Four months later, in October 2011, he said, [...] "My view is that we don't know what's causing climate change on this planet. And the idea of spending trillions and trillions of dollars to try to reduce CO2 emissions is not the right course for us." [...] He expressed his opposition to cap and trade plans and to regulation of carbon emissions. In June 2012, Romney's domestic policy advisor Oren Cass told the Los Angeles Times, [...] "He's a supporter of renewable energy, as long as it's anything that would be economically competitive. He doesn't know the extent to which climate change is occurring or that human activity is causing it.... What you won't see are mandates or taxes or regulations that interfere with economic activity." ...|$|E
