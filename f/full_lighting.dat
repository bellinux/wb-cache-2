2500|$|At 03:50 on 13 September Barøy {{was struck}} by a torpedo some [...] west of Tranøy Lighthouse, sinking within minutes. The torpedo ripped open the ship's hull, quickly {{flooding}} her with water, and immediately knocking out the electrical power on board. Due to the ship sinking so rapidly {{there was no time to}} lower the lifeboats, and the people on board had to jump into the water in order to survive. At the time of the sinking the water temperature was 78 °C. The torpedo that sank Barøy had been dropped by an 817 Squadron Fairey Albacore, one of seven that attacked shipping in the Vestfjorden area that morning. The Albacore crews also claimed to have sunk another vessel, of around 2,000 tons, in the same attack. The Fleet Air Arm aircraft came from the fleet carrier , which was part of Force M which had escorted the old carrier , carrying 24 Hawker Hurricane fighters to the Soviet Union. On their way back to the UK the Albacores on board Victorious were assigned anti-shipping and bombing missions on the Norwegian coast and 12 aircraft took off at 03:00 and flew east, navigating by moonlight. Seven of the Albacores belonged to 817 Squadron and carried torpedoes, the remaining five were 832 Squadron aircraft with bombs. While the 817 Squadron aircraft sank Barøy, the 832 Squadron bombed the hydroelectric power station in Glomfjord, the aluminium plant Nordag in Haugvik and the radio station at Røst. Two Norwegian civilians died at Glomfjord and one at Røst. No British aircraft were lost during the operation. At the time of the attack Barøy had been sailing with <b>full</b> <b>lighting</b> due to work being carried out on the deck cargo. The wreck of the ship rests at depth of around [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} shade {{on the growth}} and {{development}} of Bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon) (L.) Pers.) was determined under glasshouse conditions. The plants were grown from shoot propagules in <b>full</b> <b>light,</b> under different layers of green netting (provides 42, 58 and 77 % shade) and under plants canopy {maize (65 % shade) and soybean (67 % shade) } for 42 to 84 days. Results have shown that continuous shading severely {{reduced the number of}} tillers, leaf area, leaf dry weight, stem dry weight, root dry weight and total dry weight of C. dactylon. After 84 days continuous shading, plants grown in 42, 58 and 77 % shade and with maize (65 % shade) or soybean (67 % shade) yielded only 25, 21, 7, 11 and 15 %, respectively as much total dry weight as the plants grown in <b>full</b> <b>light.</b> Shading at later growth stages also reduced growth of C. dactylon but early shading followed by <b>full</b> <b>light</b> at later stages had less shade effect. For example at the final harvest, plants that were transferred from 77 % shade to <b>full</b> <b>light</b> at day 42 after planting had 45 % of the total dry weight of the plants in the continuous <b>full</b> <b>light</b> treatment, but plants transferred from <b>full</b> <b>light</b> to 77 % shade at day 42 had only 27 % as much. Constant shading reduced Dry Matter Production (DMP), Net Assimilation Rate (NAR), Relative Growth Rate (RGR) and Leaf Area Duration (LAD) but increased Leaf Area Ratio (LAR). Plants shaded after 42 days in <b>full</b> <b>light</b> maintained larger LAD then continuously shaded plants but had similar or lower NAR values to them during the shaded period. Early shaded plants had slightly larger NAR than the plants that were maintained continuously in the <b>full</b> <b>light</b> treatment and increased their LAD compared to the continuously shaded plants...|$|R

40|$|Doctoral thesisThe need {{to develop}} forest {{management}} systems other than clearfelling {{has resulted in a}} requirement for improved understanding of the potential of continuous cover forestry (CCF). One suggested method for the conversion of forest stands into CCF systems and for bringing under-performing forests into productivity is thinning in conjunction with underplanting. This study was an attempt to provide information on species suitability for underplanting of two important trees in European forestry: pedunculate oak (Quercus robur L.) and European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.). To determine the morphological, physiological and growth responses of these two species to different light conditions, beech and oak seedlings previously grown at <b>full</b> <b>light</b> for two years were covered by shading nets that provide different shade levels (62 %, 51 % or 28 % of <b>full</b> <b>light)</b> or continued to be exposed to <b>full</b> <b>light.</b> The different shade levels were intended to mimic a range of underplanted conditions and the process of acclimation to shade was studied to provide information on the ecology and adaptation of underplanted seedlings. In addition to the controlled-shade experiment another study to determine the physiological responses of beech natural regeneration to shade was conducted under natural light conditions (from open gaps to closed canopy). Both oak and beech displayed similar acclimation in response to shade for most of the traits investigated. At the plant level, seedling acclimation to shade included higher biomass allocation to above than below-ground parts and greater energy investment on height than diameter growth. At the leaf level, seedlings grown under shade reduced their leaf thickness and photosynthetic rates per unit area and increased their specific leaf area. This increase in specific leaf area seems to be one mechanism that allows seedlings to perform well under shade conditions. Another acclimation to low light conditions was to increase the efficiency of the photosystem II under shade. Photosynthetic rates were higher and leaves were retained for longer in seedlings grown at <b>full</b> <b>light</b> than under shade. Hence, this probably led to a greater growth in the <b>full</b> <b>light</b> than under shade. Despite this greater growth at <b>full</b> <b>light,</b> {{the results of this study}} suggest that beech and oak seedlings would be able to acclimate and perform well if underplanted below overstories that reduce the available light to as low as 28 % of <b>full</b> <b>light</b> without having any significant adverse effect on the quality of the final crop...|$|R
