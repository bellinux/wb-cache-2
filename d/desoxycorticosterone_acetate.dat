Averaged flowing lymph volume on 25 sound dogs at 10 minutes from the thoracic duct-fistle formation was 3. 5 cc, total protein nitrogen 511 mg, albumin nitrogen 266 mg/ 100 cc, globulin nitrogen 171 mg/ 100 cc, A/G ratio 1. 35, fibrinogen nitrogen 33 mg/ 100 cc, and non-protein nitrogen was 31 mg/ 100 cc. 2. Administration of allyl formate brought an increase on flowing lymph volume and total protein contents, and the increase was apparent on albumin fraction in the early stage and on globulin fraction in the end stadium. A/G ratio, therefore, increased temporally in the early stage, and afterward the value reduced gradually to reach below that before the administration of allyl formate. Both fibrinogen and non-protein nitrogen increased. These results may suggest that allyl formate brings serous inflammatory process. 3. Administration of Syncorta, a preparate of <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate,</b> brought inhibition of increases of thoracic duct lymph volume and total protein volume, decrease of A/G ratio, and increase of fibrinogen on the allyl fomate-administered dog.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} {{whereby the}} vasoconstrictor response to angiotensin II (AII) {{is influenced by}} sodium balance or disease is unclear. To explore this question, the renal vascular responses (RVR) to intrarenal injections of subpressor doses of AII and norepinephrine were studied in dogs with an electromagnetic flowmeter. Acute and chronic sodium depletion increased plasma renin activity (PRA) and blunted the RVR to AII, while acute sodium repletion and chronic sodium excess plus <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> decreased PRA and enhanced the RVR to AII. The magnitude of the RVR to AII was inversely related to PRA. The RVR to norepinephrine was unaffected by sodium balance and {{was not related to}} PRA. Inhibition of the conversion of angiotensin I to AII by SQ 20, 881 during sodium depletion lowered mean arterial blood pressure (MABP), increased renal blood flow (RBF), and enhanced the RVR to AII but not to norepinephrine. Administration of bradykinin to chronically sodium-depleted dogs also lowered the MABP and increased RBF but had no effect on the RVR to AII. SQ 20, 881 had no effect on MABP, RBF, or the RVR to AII in the dogs with chronic sodium excess and <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate.</b> Administration of indomethacin to chronically sodium-depleted dogs lowered RBF but did not influence the RVR to AII. The results indicate that the RVR to AII is selectively influenced by sodium balance and that the magnitude of the response is inversely related to the availability of endogenous AII. The data did not suggest that the variations in the RVR to AII were because of direct effects of sodium on vascular contraction, changes in the number of vascular AII receptors, or the renal prostaglandins. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the vasoconstrictor effect of AII in the renal vasculature is primarily dependent upon {{the degree to which the}} AII vascular receptors are occupied by endogenous hormone...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of the effects of}} adrenal cortical steroids on the response of the vascular system to bacterial endotoxin has shown that glucocorticoids (cortisone, triamcinolone) are capable of preparing the system for the generalized Shwartzman reaction.

Administering insulin, with maintenance of normal blood sugar, had no effect on the extent of glomerular capillary thrombosis. Blockade, however, of α-adrenergic receptor sites by Dibenzyline caused a significant reduction of the thrombosis. In addition, cortisone-treated animals did not require exogenous stimulation of α-adrenergic receptor sites by norepinephrine to localize thrombi in the glomerular capillaries when Hageman factor was activated (by ellagic acid) and fibrinolysis inhibited (by ε-aminocaproic acid).

In addition, specific pre-pro-ANP messenger RNA content in rat atria was significantly elevated as early as 12 h after mineralocorticoid administration and remained elevated at 24, 48, and 72 h, indicating a prompt and sustained increase in ANP biosynthesis. Renal glomerular ANP receptor density was down-regulated appropriately with rising plasma ANP levels, and receptor affinity was unchanged.

Despite a considerable parallel between the effects of DCA and the findings in the human disease, only indirect evidence links essential hypertension to the DCA-induced condition (3). A distinct barrier to a direct linkage between the two conditions still remains in the fact that there is little proof of adrenal cortical hypersecretion in most instances of essential hypertension. In studying this problem we noted that there was little information concerning the course of DCA hypertension once treatment with the steroid was discontinued.

The in-fluence of bilateral adrenalectomy on {{the synthesis of}} norepinephrine (NE) in the rat heart was determined by three independent methods 6 to 9 days after the operation. Two of the methods involved estimating turnover rates by: 1) measuring the decline of cardiac NE after inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase with a-methyl-p-tyrosine (cz-MPT) and 2) measur-ing the decline in specific activity of H’-NE in the heart after its i. v. administration. The third method involved measuring the amount of C 14 -NE formed in the heart after the i. v. administration of C 14 -tyrosine.

Like others, we have concluded that the intensifying effect of saline resides in the sodium ion, although we have suggested that other ions may likewise be capable of increasing the effects (5). Following on this, it appeared that the next phase of the problem was to elucidate the mechanism of action of DCA.

40|$|Following {{the reports}} of Kimmelstiel and Wilson (1) and Murakami (2) on the {{pathognomonic}} association of nodular glomerular lesions with human diabetes, a number of experiments have been performed on laboratory animals {{with the intent of}} producing similar lesions. Two approaches were pursued: (a) In one, experiments were designed to induce the lesions in animals by virtue of their being diabetic. Alloxan-induced diabetes has generally failed to bring about these lesions. One of us (3) studied the effects of alloxan diabetes, alone and with other agents, in New Zealand albino rabbits. In these experiments 20 per cent of the animals made diabetic by alloxan, and maintained for 2 years with blood sugar levels of 400 to 750 nag per cent, showed an occasional glomerulus with loci of collagen or hyalinization. Similarly, alloxan diabetic rabbits when fed cholesterol singly or in combination with either <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> or cortisone remained without apparent alteration of the glomeruli. The induction of the hypertensive state in the alloxan diabetic animal by bilateral renal artery constriction failed to produce significant glomerular lesions. Also, normal rabbits given cortisone alone did not produce glomerulosclerosis...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} the {{relation}} between experimental renal hypertension and essential hypertension in man, hinging on the primacy of the kidney, has assumed a critical importance in recent years. The alternate positions have been summarized by Smith, Goldring, and Chasis (1), Goldring and Chasis (2), and more recently by Goldblatt (3). Recent work by Selye and his colleagues implicating the adrenal cortex in the etiology of the hypertensive syndrome has, in a sense, offered an intermediate position (4, 5). These workers demonstrated, first in the chick (6), and later, in the rat, dog, and monkey (7), that overdosage with <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DCA) could produce hypertension and renal damage in animals sensitized with saline. Later these workers demonstrated that an endogenous overproduction of cortical hormones resulting from stress could also cause this nephrosderosis and hypertension in the rat (8). The r 61 e of the adrenal in experimental hypertension in animals has been confirmed by many workers, more recently by Anderson, Page, Li, and Ogden (9), and Page, Ogden, and Anderson (10), who showed that renal hypertension could be restored in hypophysectomized rats by administration of the adrenocorticotropic hormone alone...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of dextrose-enhanced peritoneal mass transport rates. The mechanism whereby hypertonic dextrose affects peritoneal transport {{was investigated in}} a short-term model of peritoneal dialysis using alert intact rabbits. During control (1. 5 % dextrose) dialyses osmotic ultrafiltration was 0. 28 mg/kg/min, the clearance of potassium was 0. 98, urea 0. 54, phosphate 0. 32, and dextrose (reverse) 0. 21 ml/kg/min. With 4. 25 % dextrose, the ultrafiltration rate increased to 0. 73 ml/kg/min (P < 0. 02), but solute transport did not increase despite the added convective flux. The posthypertonic exchanges {{did not differ from}} control despite the effect of residual dialysate contaminating this peritoneal lavage. By indicator dilution residual volume averaged 12 % of total dialysate volume. Acute volume expansion by intravenous dextrose after <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DOCA) pretreatment increased the ultrafiltration coefficient, potassium and urea clearances significantly, and DOCA alone was ineffective. It is suggested that in uremic humans hypertonic dextrose dialysis increases peritoneal mass transport rates because the absorbed dextrose causes extracellular volume expansion that cannot be eliminated promptly. No evidence of a direct effect of dextrose augmenting peritoneal permeability was detected...|$|E
40|$|Structural-functional {{heterogeneity}} {{along the}} rabbit collecting tubule. The {{possibility that the}} rabbit collecting tubule is heterogeneous with respect to electrical and morphologic properties was examined in isolated segments. Collecting tubules from rabbits treated with <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> were dissected from various locations within the cortex and outer medulla, and the transepithelial potential was measured. The cortical collecting tubule always displayed a negative potential. In contrast, collecting tubules dissected from the inner stripe of the outer medulla displayed a positive potential. That this change {{is a function of}} position within the kidney is supported by the observation that some tubules generated a negative potential at the superficial (cortical) end and a positive potential at the deep (medullary) end of the same tubule. Histologic evaluation of tubules after perfusion resulted in a striking correlation between the existence of a negative potential and the presence of dark cells. The results of this study provide evidence that the collecting tubule is heterogeneous with respect to active transport processes and suggest that these functional differences may correlate with morphologic differences between the cortical segment and the medullary segment of the collecting tubule...|$|E
40|$|Note: Some pages out of order. The {{well-known}} {{regulation of}} the electrolyte balance by the adrenal cortex {{has been attributed to}} its secretion of a hormone similar to, if not identical with, desoxycorticosterone. A deficiency of adrenocortical hormone lowers both serum chloride and sodium, and elevates potassium. Therapy with desoxycorticosterone rapidly restores these electrolyte levels to normal by markedly increasing the retention of sodium and chloride and reducing the renal retention of potassium. Therefore it seemed paradoxical to find that large doses of <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DCA) can lower the serum chloride of both normal and adrenalectomized animals. At the outset of this research, the problem was to determine the mechanism by which DCA produced this hypochloremia, which has been observed by several investigators. It seemed probable that it was an overdosage effect related to the loss of potassium produced by DCA, and that this steroid must increase the urine chloride excretion, contrary to the available information indicating that it produces chloride retention. These factors were investigated. Balance studies on chloride and potassium ions were performed to determine the relation between the chloride and potassium excretions in potassium deficiency. This problem of the effect of DCA and potassium deficiency on chloride balance forms {{the first part of this}} thesis. [ [...] . ...|$|E
40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that preeclampsia, a pregnancy-specific hypertension disorder, is characterized by high blood pressure (BP) and sympathetic overactivity. Increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM), a key region for controlling sympathetic tone, {{has been reported to}} contribute to high level of BP and sympathetic outflow. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the role of the RVLM ROS in mediating the preeclampsia-associated cardiovascular dysfunction. Methods: The animal model of preeclampsia was produced by administration of <b>desoxycorticosterone</b> <b>acetate</b> (DOCA) to pregnant rats. Results: Compared with normal pregnant rats without DOCA treatment (NP), the protein concentration and norepinephrine excretion in 24 -h urine, as well as BP in pregnant rats with DOCA treatment (PDS) were significantly increased. The levels of superoxide anion and the protein expression of NADPH oxidase subtype (NOX 4) in the RVLM were significantly increased in PDS than in NP groups. Furthermore, microinjection of the superoxide dismutase (SOD) mimic Tempol (5 nmol) into the RVLM significantly decreased BP, heart rate, and renal sympathetic never activity in PDS but not in NP group. Conclusion: The present data suggest that high BP and sympathetic overactivity in preeclampsia rats is associated with increased oxidative stress in the RVLM via upregulation of NOX 4 expression...|$|E
