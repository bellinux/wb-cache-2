The EP would also internalize the costs of current externalities (like pollution) and “would be set {{as a function of}} the distance traded”, reducing the effects of long-distance transport like carbon emissions and increased packaging of goods. He thinks that this will provide a “standard of transformation” for non-ecological industries, like the automobile industry, thus spurring changes towards ecological production.|$|E

2500|$|The {{best known}} cartonería {{enterprise}} {{is that of}} the Linares family in Mexico City, with an international reputation <b>for</b> <b>forms</b> such as skeletons, skulls, Judas figures and fantastical creatures called [...] "alebrijes." [...] The family's fame began with Pedro Linares who created cartonería figures as a seasonal occupation. Sometime prior to the 1950s, Pedro began to create more inventive figures including the alebrijes. The inventiveness of the work allowed them to not only sell their wares in traditional markets but they also began to sell them at the Angel de la Independencia monument in the fashionable Zona Rosa neighborhood, gaining them patronage with artists and scholars. This allowed the family business to survive the near ban on Judas figures which occurred in the city after a 1957 explosion at a warehouse. The fame of the Linares work went international {{as a result of the}} 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, when they were contracted by Dolores Olmedo to create life sized skeletal figures of Olympic athletes. While such animated figures have been common for Day of the Dead, it was the first time such was done on a large scale. This led to their work being sought out by museums and others in the United States and Europe. [...] In 1990 Pedro Linares received the distinguished National Award for Science and Art from the Mexican government.|$|E
