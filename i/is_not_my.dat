5|$|It was {{a little}} strange. And {{definitely}} when I {{walked down the aisle}} I was like, 'This is kind of creepy — there’s some other man standing there!' It was really beautiful. People were all really excited like it was really my wedding. My mother was even like, 'Aww', and I was like, 'Mom, it's a video. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> dress. This is not the real wedding.' But I think it’s just one of those moments that every woman kind of fantasizes and relives.|$|E
25|$|The {{second proof}} is more {{reminiscent}} of R.D. Laing: Your concept of your concept <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> concept of your concept—a reproduced concept {{is not the}} same as the original concept. Pask defined concepts as persisting, countably infinite, recursively packed spin processes (like many cored cable, or skins of an onion) in any medium (stars, liquids, gases, solids, machines and, of course, brains) that produce relations.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> main {{ground of}} {{complaint}} {{that you have}} her, even though I loved her dearly; that she has you is my chief regret, a loss that touches me more closely. Loving offenders, I excuse you both thus: you love her, because you know I love her; similarly, she abuses me for my sake, in allowing my friend to have her. If I lose you, my loss is a gain to my love; and losing her, my friend picks up that loss. Both find each other, I lose both, and both lay this cross on me for my sake. But there is one consolation in this thought: my friend and I are one; therefore she loves me alone.|$|E

25|$|Channing {{continued}} {{her return to}} the stage by teaming up again with playwright John Guare. She received Tony Award nominations for her performances in his plays, The House of Blue Leaves (1986) and Six Degrees of Separation (1990), for which she also won an Obie Award. The Alan Ayckbourn play Woman in Mind received its American premiere Off-Broadway in February 1988 at the Manhattan Theatre Club. The production was directed by Lynne Meadow and the cast included Channing {{in the role of}} Susan, for which she won a Drama Desk Award for Best Actress. When once asked if Susan was Channing's most fully realized character, the actress replied: Well, you like to think that they’re all fully realized because what you’re doing is different from what anyone else is seeing. You do a character but {{how much of it is}} on film, or how much of it is seen by an audience, is really up to the director, the piece, or the audience. And so, I just do these people. And flesh them out. I think anything else <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> job.|$|E
25|$|I {{know that}} some people are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> purpose when people ask me about the legitimacy of the dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E
500|$|... "Dog Eat Dog" [...] is a style {{parody of}} the Talking Heads. Described as a [...] "tongue-in-cheek look at office life", the song was {{inspired}} by Yankovic's past experience of working in the mailrooms {{as well as the}} traffic department at Westwood One radio station. He noted, [...] "At first I thought [...] was kinda cool that I had a phone and a desk and a little cubicle to call my own, but after a while I felt like my soul had been sucked out of me." [...] The song features a line directly parodying the Talking Heads song [...] "Once In a Lifetime": [...] "Sometimes I tell myself, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> beautiful stapler/Sometimes I tell myself this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> beautiful chair!" [...] This mirrors a similar line in the Talking Heads song: [...] "You may tell yourself, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> beautiful house/You may tell yourself, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> beautiful wife".|$|E
6000|$|... "But you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> mother," [...] {{said the}} boy, {{recovering}} his recollection, and endeavouring, though faintly, {{to escape from}} the caresses of the Lady of Avenel; [...] "you <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> mother,--alas! I have no mother--only I have dreamt that I had one." ...|$|R

500|$|Another {{contemporary}} writer {{also wrote}} of Rhys if Roger Turvey {{is correct in}} stating that Walter Map's piece Of the King Appollonides deals with Rhys under a pseudonym. Map was less favourably disposed toward Rhys, describing him as [...] "This king I have seen and know, and hate", but {{goes on to say}} [...] "I would not have my hatred blacken his worth; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> wish ever to suppress any man's excellence through envy". He tells the following story about Apollonides/Rhys: ...|$|E

Then, Stottlemeyer and Disher {{go back to the}} precinct {{to try to get a}} bead on Tennyson's location while Monk and Sharona discover that the ambassador's final words meant [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> coat". Stottlemeyer breaks into Cage's office to discover that Tennyson is dying in a hospital and has days left to live. Stottlemeyer confronts Cage, who says the only way he will allow access to Tennyson is if Monk solves the ambassador's murder.|$|E

500|$|Friedgen {{stated that}} the curfew {{violations}} occurred over several nights, and that different players violated the rule to separate degrees. He informed Maryland athletic director Deborah Yow of the infractions and initially suggested sending all of the curfew violators back to Maryland by bus. Yow dissented, and they agreed to suspend the players {{for part of the}} game. Describing the incident, Friedgen said that [...] "Five percent of [...] guys thought they didn't need to listen to me, that they could get bed checked and sneak out." [...] He added, [...] "But I checked again at 1 o'clock. [...] "This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> first rodeo." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with [...] "Thriller", [...] "Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'", and [...] "Beat It", [...] "Billie Jean" [...] was {{performed}} {{for all of}} Michael Jackson's tour concerts. After the ending chorus, the drum solo is always extended {{for a period of}} time as Jackson dances under one spotlight. The song almost always ends with Jackson singing [...] "Billie Jean <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> lover" [...] and throwing his hat towards the audience. Exceptions are some of the concerts in the Victory Tour, where he held his hat up and threw it afterwards. Since the Victory Tour, the performance has evolved in terms of dance moves and overall song length.|$|E
500|$|Not My Life is a 2011 American {{independent}} {{documentary film}} about human trafficking and contemporary slavery. The film was written, produced, {{and directed by}} Robert Bilheimer, who {{had been asked to}} make the film by Antonio Maria Costa, executive director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Bilheimer planned Not My Life as the second installment in a trilogy, the first being A Closer Walk and the third being the unproduced Take Me Home. The title Not My Life came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, who said that many people deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, saying, [...] "No, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E

500|$|Bilheimer {{said that}} the level of cruelty he saw in {{shooting}} Not My Life was greater than anything he had seen when documenting apartheid in South Africa for The Cry of Reason. Bilheimer attested to becoming more aware of the global extent of human trafficking as he went about making Not My Life. The film's title came from a June 2009 interview with Molly Melching, founder of Tostan, an organization dedicated to human rights education operating in ten African countries. As Bilheimer and Melching spoke in Thiès, Senegal, discussing how people often deny the reality of contemporary slavery because it is an uncomfortable truth, Melching said, [...] "People can say, 'No, this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> life.' But my life can change. Let's change together." ...|$|E
500|$|It is {{also stated}} that my name, my real name, {{that is the one}} I am known by, <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> real name. Now one is given one's name—one's {{authentic}} ones—at some such ceremony as baptism, Christening, or the like, on the occasion of one's formal reception into a certain religious Faith. In the ancient Zarathustrian Parsi community to which, on my father's side, I have the honour to belong, this ceremony is normally performed, as in other Faiths, in childhood, or owing to special circumstances as in my case, later in life, when I assumed my name as it now is or, {{in the words of the}} legal document in which this is mentioned [...] "...received into the Parsi community and in accordance with the custom and tradition thereof, is now and will be henceforth known as..." [...] and here follows my name as now.|$|E
500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] {{is a song}} by American singer Michael Jackson. It is {{the second}} single from the singer's sixth studio album, Thriller (1982). It was written and {{composed}} by Jackson and produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones. There are contradictory claims {{on the meaning of}} the song's lyrics. One suggests that they are derived from a real-life experience, in which a female fan claimed that Jackson (or one of his brothers) had fathered her twins. However, Michael Jackson stated that [...] "Billie Jean" [...] was based on groupies he had encountered. The song is well known for its distinctive bassline played by Louis Johnson, the standard drum beat heard in the beginning, the repetition of [...] "Billie Jean <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> lover" [...] {{towards the end of the}} song and Michael Jackson's vocal hiccups. The song was mixed 91 times by audio engineer Bruce Swedien before it was finalized, though he reportedly went with the second mix as the final product.|$|E

500|$|After again {{considering}} a candidacy for the 1988 presidential election, influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with {{remaining in the}} Senate, in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run. [...] He added: [...] "I know this decision means I may never be president. But {{the pursuit of the}} presidency <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> life. Public service is." [...] Kennedy used his legislative skills to achieve passage of the COBRA Act, which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job. Following the 1986 congressional elections, the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee. [...] By now Kennedy had become what colleague Joe Biden termed [...] "the best strategist in the Senate," [...] who always knew when best to move legislation. Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator Orrin Hatch, and they were close allies on many health-related measures.|$|E
500|$|The {{first four}} {{numbers of the}} Journal {{featured}} Fielding's contributions to the [...] "Paper War", a conflict he instigated with writers of other contemporary periodicals to generate sales. In the first number, along with the promise to avoid the dullness of other periodicals, Fielding confronted [...] "the armies of Grub Street" [...] and proclaimed his disdain for the literary critics of the day: [...] "As to my brother authors, who, like mere mechanics, are envious and jealous of a rival in their trade, to silence their jealousies and fears, I declare that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> intention to encroach on the business now carried on by them, nor to deal {{in any of those}} wares which they at present vend to the public." [...] Also given in the inaugural number was [...] "An introduction to a journal of the present paper-war between the forces under Sir Alexander Drawcansir, and the army of Grub Street", written in the tradition of Jonathan Swift's Battle of the Books.|$|E
500|$|Price Peterson of TV.com {{wrote that}} while he [...] "liked it overall", he disliked the focus on Logan and Weevil, writing that he was [...] "more than ready for Weevil to be written off the show" [...] and, [...] "I'm getting {{slightly}} tired of [...] storylines. He seems to be alternating between woe-is-me hangdog and shifty bro liar. [...] Logan <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>my</b> favorite." [...] On his blog What's Alan Watching, Alan Sepinwall wrote that [...] "this was a fairly light-hearted hour, with the two darkest events -- Weevil beating up the abusive boyfriend and the blonde getting raped -- taking place off-screen. And if the purpose of doing shorter arcs was to avoid the loss of momentum that both the bus crash and the bridge stabbing suffered {{in the middle of}} last year, I'm not sure if it's working yet."
