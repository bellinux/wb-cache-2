5|$|Not {{listed below}} are Hugh Magnus, <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> of Robert II, and Philip of France, <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> of Louis VI; both were co-kings {{with their fathers}} (in {{accordance}} with the early Capetian practice whereby kings would crown their heirs in their own lifetimes and share power with the co-king), but predeceased them. Because neither Hugh nor Philip were sole or senior king in their own lifetimes, they are not traditionally listed as Kings of France, and are not given ordinals.|$|E
5|$|Very {{little is}} known of Sviatoslav's family life. It is {{possible}} {{that he was not}} the only (or the <b>eldest)</b> <b>son</b> of his parents. The Russo-Byzantine treaty of 945 mentions a certain Predslava, Volodislav's wife, as the noblest of the Rus' women after Olga. The fact that Predslava was Oleg's mother is presented by Vasily Tatishchev. He also speculated that Predslava was of a Hungarian nobility. George Vernadsky was among many historians to speculate that Volodislav was Igor's <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> and heir who died at some point during Olga's regency. Another chronicle told that Oleg (? - 944?) was the <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> of Igor. At the time of Igor's death, Sviatoslav was still a child, and he was raised by his mother or under her instructions. Her influence, however, did not extend to his religious observance.|$|E

According to the Nawab’s law, the <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> of the Nawab succeeded him, however, Waris Ali's <b>eldest</b> <b>son,</b> Wakif Ali Meerza Bahadur, was excluded from the succession by his father for contracting a non-Muslim marriage and for not professing the Muslim religion.|$|E

5|$|Hairan I: {{the name}} appears on a 251 {{inscription}} from Palmyra describing him as Ras implying {{that he was}} already an adult by then. In the Augustan History, Odaenathus' <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> is named Herod; the inscription at Palmyra dating to 263 celebrating Hairan's coronation mentions him with the name Herodianus. It is possible that Hairan of the 251 inscription {{is not the same}} as Herodianus of the 263, but this is contested by Hartmann who conclude that the reason for the difference in the spelling is due to the language used in the inscription (Herodianus being the Greek version), meaning that Odaenathus' <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> and co-king is Hairan Herodianus.|$|E

5|$|In 1087, William was fatally injured {{during a}} {{campaign}} in the Vexin. Henry joined his dying father near Rouen in September, where the King partitioned his possessions among his sons. The rules of succession in western Europe {{at the time were}} uncertain; in some parts of France, primogeniture, in which the <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> would inherit a title, was growing in popularity. In other parts of Europe, including Normandy and England, the tradition was for lands to be divided up, with the <b>eldest</b> <b>son</b> taking patrimonial lands – usually considered to be the most valuable – and younger sons given smaller, or more recently acquired, partitions or estates.|$|E
