PetFinder says the breed is soft in temperament, companionable, demonstrative, loyal, and a quiet housedog.

The New Zealand Kennel Club warns against keeping them with dogs that have dominant personalities, [...] "as once challenged they are terrifying fighters, despite their gentle appearance", but otherwise the breed is good with other dogs.|$|E

Drawing a parallel to the [...] "controlled folly" [...] described in Castaneda's A Separate Reality, Rhinehart argues that in almost all cases, enlightenment is linked to humor: [...] "One can rarely have an enlightenment experience except under the impact of nonsense ... Every time we laugh {{we are in a}} way experiencing a mini enlightenment, a tiny letting go of some attachment to some bit of belief or sense. Full enlightenment, in these terms, <b>is</b> <b>accepting</b> what is, which leads to experiencing fully whatever one is experiencing." ...|$|E

Much to his dismay, Will believes he, a lawyer, <b>is</b> <b>accepting</b> legal clients. Karen finally reveals to Will {{that she has been}} telling everyone he is her gigolo.

500|$|After {{receiving}} {{reports of}} mass casualties and destruction at Pass-a-Grille, the American Red Cross stocked a United States Navy subchaser with pine caskets and relief supplies, but found no bodies {{and only a}} fraction of the reported damage. Because of fears that the hurricane might hinder the Florida land boom of the 1920s, rebuilding and cleanup of the area commenced quickly and the land boom in the Tampa Bay region and in southern Florida continued. Local officials, businessmen, realtors, and later the press soon attempted to cover up or downplay the damage, which threatened to distort Tampa's advertised image as the [...] "Year Round City". On October28, a writer for The Tampa Tribune stated, [...] "Everyone <b>is</b> <b>accepting</b> the storm as an incident and all are going to work to rebuild the devastated areas, with the firm conviction that there will not be another storm of such severity during the life of anyone now living." [...] One of the destroyed buildings at the Ballist Point Pavilion was soon rebuilt after the storm. However, the building was destroyed again by fire in 1922. In 1925, a new pavilion was built. On Captiva Island, the Wayside Chapel suffered extensive damage, but was repaired and reopened as Captiva School and Chapel-by-the-Sea, which has been listed as a National Historic Place since 2013. Many farmers on the island sold their land for a significantly reduced price to Clarence B. Chadwick, who would transform more than [...] of property into the South Seas Island Resort.|$|E
500|$|AJ {{brings out}} a {{different}} side to Masood, which Ganatra said could [...] "upset the status quo".

[...] Presenter Kate Thornton, when interviewing Ganatra, said AJ was a [...] "playmate" [...] for Masood, while Wadia said that AJ brings the comedy back to Masood. Inside Soap Kate White called AJ [...] "a world away from family man Masood", while Soaplife said AJ is [...] "not a good influence but he sure puts a smile on [...] face and a new spring in his step." [...] Daniel Kilkelly from Digital Spy said that AJ's influence on Masood is [...] "infectious". AJ's arrival allows people to see what Masood was like before he married Zainab, as all that was known about him to that point was his life with her. Ganatra stated: [...] "So by opening this door, you get to see what Masood was like in his childhood and as a teenager. Masood did have a naughty streak—he was in a band with his brother, and they got up to mischief. Masood [...] has been put on the straight and narrow [...] But prior to that, he was a teenager like any other—getting into trouble, and that was in cahoots with his brother AJ!" [...] Ganatra said that, as British Asians, Masood and AJ grew up going to clubs and getting into trouble with girls. Now, Masood sees AJ as somebody with [...] "no responsibilities, no children and no stress of having to provide for a family" [...] and as AJ suffers marrital problems, is feeling lonely and has no children, Ganatra said [...] "they want each other's lives, which is quite a nice dynamic to play." [...] He added that [...] "AJ would love the stability of a family life like Masood's, while Masood would love to pack his bags, get drunk and perhaps end up in a stranger's bed. I'm interested to see him bring out Masood's naughty streak—and where that could take them..."

2500|$|There is {{widespread}} agreement that p-values are often misused and misinterpreted. One practice {{that has been}} particularly criticized <b>is</b> <b>accepting</b> the alternative hypothesis for any p-value nominally less than [...]05 without other supporting evidence. Although p-values are helpful in assessing how incompatible the data are with a specified statistical model, contextual factors must also be considered, such as [...] "the design of a study, {{the quality of the}} measurements, the external evidence for the phenomenon under study, and the validity of assumptions that underlie the data analysis". Another concern is that the p-value is often misunderstood as being the probability that the null hypothesis is true. Some statisticians have proposed replacing p-values with alternative measures of evidence, such as confidence intervals, likelihood ratios, or Bayes factors, but there is heated debate on the feasibility of these alternatives. Others have suggested to remove fixed significance thresholds and to interpret p-values as continuous indices of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.|$|E
