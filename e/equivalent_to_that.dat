5|$|Estimates of lifespans {{for wild}} orcas vary. SeaWorld says wild lifespans are 30–50 years for females, and 19–30 years for males. These {{estimates}} {{depart from the}} findings of a 2005 study, which pegged the mean age of females at 45.8 years and males at 31.0 during the period between 1973 and 1996. Marine conservation groups argue that even these estimates are low due to the effects of hunting, pollution, and capture on the wild populations, and that natural wild orca lifespans are <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of humans, with male orcas living up to 75 years and female orcas living up to 80 years.|$|E

5|$|A {{key feature}} of the Cadet Nurse Corps program was its {{accelerated}} training curricula. Participating schools of nursing were required to compress the traditional nursing program of 36 months to 30 months. They were also bound to provide the students with the four clinical experiences of medical, surgical, obstetrics, and pediatrics. The students became senior cadets {{in the last six}} months before graduation, requiring them to serve in a federal or civilian hospital. They rendered full-time service <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a graduate nurse. During their first nine months of service, the cadets were protected by regulation from working on the wards for more than 24 hours each week. Junior cadets typically worked between 40 and 48 hours each week, including classes. Senior cadets were free of classes. All State Boards of Nursing modified their regulations to agree with the accelerated program.|$|E
5|$|After {{several months}} of poor health, Suramarit, Sihanouk's father, died on 3April 1960 which Sihanouk blamed upon the shock {{that his father had}} {{received}} from the parcel bomb attack. The following day, the royal throne council met to choose Monireth as regent. Over the next two months, Sihanouk introduced constitutional amendments to create the new post of Head of State of Cambodia, which provided ceremonial powers <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the king. A referendum held on 5June 1960 approved Sihanouk's proposals, and Sihanouk was formally appointed Head of State on 14June 1960. As the head of state, Sihanouk took over various ceremonial responsibilities of the king, such as holding public audiences and leading the Royal Ploughing Ceremony. At the same time, he continued to play an active role in politics as Sangkum's leader.|$|E

5|$|Brezhnev was {{adept at}} the {{politics}} within the Soviet power structure. He {{was a team}} player and never acted rashly or hastily; unlike Khrushchev, he did not make decisions without substantial consultation from his colleagues, and was always willing to hear their opinions. During the early 1970s, Brezhnev consolidated his domestic position. In 1977, he forced the retirement of Podgorny and became once again Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, making this position <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of an executive president.

5|$|In RRMS {{they are}} {{modestly}} effective at decreasing {{the number of}} attacks. The interferons and glatiramer acetate are first-line treatments and are roughly equivalent, reducing relapses by approximately 30%. Early-initiated long-term therapy is safe and improves outcomes. Natalizumab reduces the relapse rate more than first-line agents; however, due to issues of adverse effects is a second-line agent reserved {{for those who do}} not respond to other treatments or with severe disease. Mitoxantrone, whose use is limited by severe adverse effects, is a third-line option {{for those who do not}} respond to other medications. Treatment of clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) with interferons decreases the chance of progressing to clinical MS. Efficacy of interferons and glatiramer acetate in children has been estimated to be roughly <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of adults. The role of some newer agents such as fingolimod, teriflunomide, and dimethyl fumarate, as of 2011, is not yet entirely clear.|$|E
5|$|Nightjars have {{relatively}} large eyes, {{each with a}} tapetum lucidum (reflective layer behind the retina) that makes the eyes shine in torchlight and improves light detection at dusk, dawn and in moonlight. The retinas of nocturnal birds, including nightjars, are adapted for sight in low-light levels and have a higher density of rod cells and far fewer cone cells compared to those of most diurnal birds. These adaptations favour good night vision {{at the expense of}} colour discrimination. In many day-flying species, light passes through coloured oil droplets within the cone cells to improve colour vision. In contrast, nightjars have a limited number of cone cells, either lacking or having only a few oil droplets. The nocturnal eyesight of nightjars is probably <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of owls. Although they have good hearing, European nightjars appear not to rely on sound to find insects, and nightjars do not echolocate.|$|E

5|$|The 1988 Bangladesh cyclone (designated as Tropical Cyclone 04B by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center) {{was one of}} {{the worst}} {{tropical}} cyclones in Bangladeshi history. Striking in November1988, the tropical system exacerbated the catastrophic damage from what was then considered the worst floods in Bangladesh's history. The tropical cyclone originated from a disturbance that developed within the Strait of Malacca on November21. Tracking slowly westward, the initial tropical depression reached tropical storm status in the Andaman Sea. On November26, the storm reached an intensity <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a modern-day severe cyclonic storm and subsequently turned northward. Gradually intensifying as it had previously, the tropical cyclone reached peak intensity with winds of 125mph (200km/h) as it was making landfall near the Bangladesh-West Bengal border on November29. Although the storm retained strong winds well inland, it was last monitored over central Bangladesh as a moderate cyclonic storm-equivalent on November30.|$|E
5|$|The armor {{protection}} of the Gangut-class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts unpenetrated. The Russians decided that the entire {{side of the ship}} needed to be armored, even though this would limit the thickness of the main belt. They developed a system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an inboard armor bulkhead would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the vitals. This system likely would have worked against the British armor-piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland, but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses. A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the inboard splinter bulkhead even though they used armor thickness roughly <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of the main belt.|$|E
5|$|Vera {{developed}} on September20 between Guam and Chuuk State, and initially tracked westward {{before taking a}} more northerly course, reaching tropical storm strength the following day. By this point Vera had assumed a more westerly direction of movement and had begun to rapidly intensify, and reached its peak intensity on September23 with maximum sustained winds <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a modern-day Category5 hurricane. With little change in strength, Vera curved and accelerated northward, resulting in a landfall on September26 near Shionomisaki on Honshu. Atmospheric wind patterns caused the typhoon to briefly emerge into the Sea of Japan before recurving eastward and moving ashore Honshu for a second time. Movement over land greatly weakened Vera, and after reentering the North Pacific Ocean later that day, Vera transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September27; these remnants continued to persist for an additional two days.|$|E

5|$|Intensification {{was more}} gradual {{following}} April9. At 0000UTC on April11, the JMA upgraded {{the system to}} tropical storm intensity, thus identifying it with the name Kujira. At roughly the same time, Kujira began to curve towards a westward track due to a high pressure area to the north. Concurrently the ambient wind shear abated and the storm further consolidated, allowing for more quicker strengthening. Throughout the following day, Kujira developed a banding eye feature that would later consolidate into a distinct circular eye; this was reflected with an upgrade to typhoon status by both the JTWC and JMA at 1800UTC on April12 and 0000UTC on April14, respectively. On April14, a shortwave trough caused Kujira to track slightly more northwestward. Marked intensification continued, and late on April15, the JTWC upgraded the typhoon to super typhoon intensity, {{the first of the}} year, while Kujira was located 400km (250mi) north-northwest of Yap State. At roughly the same time Kujira reached its peak intensity with winds of 165km/h (105mph). Estimated 1-minute sustained winds at that time were 250km/h (155mph), <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a Category4 hurricane on the Saffir–Simpson wind scale. Following peak intensity, Kujira continued to track westward as it entered the area of responsibility of the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration(PAGASA) at 1200UTC on April16, and as such the name Amang was assigned to the typhoon by the agency.|$|E
5|$|Vera only {{maintained}} {{peak intensity}} for roughly twelve hours, but still remained a powerful tropical cyclone. With very {{little change in}} strength, the typhoon tracked northwestward throughout September24. Due {{to the influence of}} a nearby high-pressure area, Vera began to gradually curve and rapidly accelerate northward towards Japan. At 0900UTC on September26, Vera made its first landfall on Honshu, just west of Shionomisaki. At the time, the typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph) and a barometric pressure of 920mbar (hPa; 27.17inHg). Vera traversed the Japanese island rather quickly at a speed 61km/h (38mph), and emerged into the Sea of Japan at 1530UTC that day. Despite its short stint over land, the terrain greatly weakened the tropical cyclone. Tracking into a westerly wind flow, Vera was forced eastward, resulting in a second landfall near Sakata, Honshu, with an intensity <b>equivalent</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> of a Category1 hurricane. Vera re-emerged into the North Pacific Ocean late on September26, having weakened due to advection of cold air in addition to continued land interaction. At 0600UTC on September27, the JTWC analyzed the typhoon to have weakened to tropical storm intensity. The warning center discontinued its periodic monitoring of the system, as Vera had begun to transition into an extratropical cyclone. Consequently, the JMA officially reclassified the system as an extratropical storm at 1200UTC that day. Vera's extratropical remnants continued to persist and track eastward for the next two days before the JMA last noted the storm at 1200UTC on September29.|$|E
