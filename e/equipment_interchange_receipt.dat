40|$|This thesis in Thermal Flow Drilling and Flowtap in thin {{metal sheet}} and pipes of copper and copper alloys had as {{objectives}} {{to know the}} comportment of copper and copper alloys sheet metal during the Thermal Flow Drill processes with normal tools, to know the best Speed and Feed machine data for the best bushing quality, to known the best Speed for Form Tapping processes and to know the best bush long in pure copper pipes for water solar <b>interchange</b> <b>equipment.</b> Thermal Flow Drilling (TFD) and Form Tapping (FT) {{is one of the}} research lines of the Institute of Production and Logistics (IPL) at University of Kassel. At December 1995, a work meeting of IPL, Santa Catarina University, Brazil, Buenos Aires University, Argentine, Tarapacá University (UTA), Chile members and the CEO of Flowdrill B. V. was held in Brazil. The group decided that the Manufacturing Laboratory (ML) of UTA would work with pure copper and brass alloys sheet metal and pure copper pipes in order to develop a water interchange solar heater. The Flowdrill BV Company sent tools to Tarapacá University in 1996. In 1999 IPL and the ML carried out an ALECHILE research project promoted by the DAAD and CONICyT in copper sheet metal and copper pipes and sheet metal a-brass alloys. The normal tools are lobed, conical tungsten carbide tool. When rotated at high speed and pressed with high axial force into sheet metal or thin walled tube generated heat softens the metal and allows the drill to feed forward produce a hole and simultaneously form a bushing from the displacement material. In the market exist many features but in this thesis is used short and longs normal tools of TFD. For reach the objectives it was takes as references four qualities of the frayed end bushing, where the best one is the quality class I. It was used pure copper and a-brass alloys sheet metals, with different thickness. It was used different TFD drills diameter for four thread type, from M- 5 to M 10. Similar to the Aluminium sheet metals studies it was used the predrilling processes with HSS drills around 30 % of the TFD diameter (1, 5 – 3, 0 mm D). In the next step is used only 2, 0 mm thick metal sheet, and 9, 2 mm TFD diameter for M- 10 thread. For the case of pure commercial copper pipes is used for ¾” inch diameter and 12, 8 mm (3 / 8 ”) TFD drill for holes for 3 / 8 ” pipes and different normal HSS drills for predrilling processes. The chemical sheet metal characteristics were takes as reference for the material behaviour. The Chilean pure copper have 99, 35 % of Cu and 0, 163 % of Zinc and the Chilean a-brass alloys have 75, 6 % of Cu and 24, 0 % of Zinc. It is used two German a-brass alloys; Nº 1 have 61, 6 % of Cu, 36, 03 % of Zinc and 2, 2 % of Pb and the German a-brass alloys Nº 2 have 63, 1 % of Cu, 36, 7 % of Zinc and 0 % of Pb. The equipments used were a HAAS CNC milling machine centre, a Kistler dynamometer, PC Pentium II, Acquisition card, TESTPOINT and XAct software, 3 D measurement machine, micro hardness, universal test machine, and metallographic microscope. During the test is obtained the feed force and momentum curves that shows the material behaviour with TFD processes. In general it is take three phases. It was possible obtain the best machining data for the different sheet of copper and a-brass alloys thick of Chilean materials and bush quality class I. In the case of a-brass alloys, the chemical components and the TFD processes temperature have big influence. The temperature reach to 400 º Celsius during the TFD processes and the a-brass alloys have some percents of Zinc the bush quality is class I. But when the a-brass alloys have some percents of Lead who have 200 º C melting point is not possible to obtain a bush, because the Lead gasify and the metallographic net broke. During the TFD processes the recrystallization structures occur around the Copper and a-brass alloy bush, who gives more hardness in these zones. When the threads were produce with Form Tapping processes with Flowtap tools, this hardness amount gives a high limit load of the thread when hey are tested in a special support that was developed for it. For eliminated the predrilling processes with normal HSS drills it was developed a compound tool. With this new tool it was possible obtain the best machining data for quality class I bush. For the copper pipes it is made bush without predrilling and the quality class IV was obtained. When it is was used predrilling processes, quality classes I bush were obtained. Then with different HSS drill diameter were obtained different long bush, where were soldering with four types soldering materials between pipes with 3 / 8 ” in a big one as ¾”. Those soldering unions were tested by traction test and all the 3 / 8 ” pipes broken, and the soldering zone doesn’t have any problem. Finally were developed different solar water interchange heaters and tested. As conclusions, the present Thesis shows that the Thermal Flow Drilling in thinner metal sheets of cooper and cooper alloys needs a predrilling process for frayed end quality class I bushings, similar to thinner sheets of aluminium bushes. The compound tool developed could obtain quality class I bushings and excludes predrilling processes. The bush recrystalization, product of the friction between the tool and the material, the hardness grows and it is advantageous for the Form Tapping. The methodology developed for commercial copper pipes permits to built water solar interchange heaters...|$|R
40|$|A {{combination}} of evolving technologies, economic circumstances, {{and the need}} to manage the increased flow of information culminated in the utilization of computer networks in libraries to enhance information retrieval and document delivery and facilitate access to resources. Computer networks have enabled librarians to streamline support services and reduce the costs of labor intensive operations. A computer network is a structure that makes available to an end user at one place some service performed at another place. Ever since computer users started accessing central processor resources from remote terminals three decades ago, computer networks have become complex, powerful, and versatile. Technically, computer networks have evolved from dedicated private networks to those utilizing multiplexed links or accessing hosts from multiple vendors. Geographically, computer networks have the capability to link several buildings, a few states or span the globe. Advanced telecommunications technology in concert with computer technology triggered the emergence of all sizes, shapes, and types of computer networks to enable terminals and/or users connected to the networks to communicate with each other. While libraries 2 ̆ 7 needs are changing in the fields of video and voice communications, the most profound alterations are in the realm of data communications or telecommunications among computers and between terminals and computers. To cope with the mix of requirements for sharing resources ranging from bibliographic citations and cataloging and circulation records to grant proposals and publications, librarians in the 1980 s are turning to a special form of computer network, the extended local area network or linked LAN, as a tool for connecting diverse communications equipment. A local area network is a facility providing data communications within a geographically limited area. Essentially, a local area network can bind together proliferating personal computers, terminals, host computers, and other communications <b>equipment</b> for information <b>interchange.</b> These local area networks can be connected into linked LANs or extended local area networks through fiber optic transmission in a dispersed geographical area for maximum communications efficiency. The dissertation, NETWORKING: CHOOSING A LAN PATH TO INTERCONNECTION, is about the mortar and bricks out of which computer networks are built. Special emphasis is placed on the process of designing, installing, and implementing local area networks and on the linkage of these LANs as a strategy for information management for multi type library consortia such as SEFLIN (SouthEast Library Information Network). Consisting of public and academic libraries in Southeast Florida, SEFLIN is responsible for promoting resource sharing and the dissemination of new knowledge in all areas of study for the 3. 2 million residents of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach Counties. SEFLIN participants include the Broward Community College Library, the Broward County Library System, the Florida Atlantic University Library, the Florida International University Library, the Miami – Dade Community College Library, the Miami-Dade Public Library, and the University of Miami Library. Scarcity of space, shrinking budgets, growing user demands and expectations, spiraling costs of materials and services, and price reductions in communications and computing equipment contributed to the emergence of multi type library networks such as SEFLIN for resource sharing. SEFLIN was formed to serve the needs of a mixed community of library users by supplying access to a full range of information resources and offering sophisticated support for a host of library and management function including online processing and cataloging, circulation control, serials control, fund accounting, statistical reporting, word processing and electronic mail. SEFLIN 2 ̆ 7 s primary mission is to link libraries in a common pattern of information exchange through the creation of an extended local area network or linked LAN. Sharing decision making data among public and academic libraries broadens the scope of sources and services available to the user community. Few areas in data communications much recent offering as technological innovation and local area networks. Local have seen as new commercial area network development has responded to the users 2 ̆ 7 demand for greater transmission speed and capacity. Among user advantages provided by a LAN are enhanced reliability; faster response time; flexibility in applications programming; better supported facilities; and internetworking capabilities for multiple remote locations. Spanning short distances ranging from a few meters to several kilometers and involving high data rates and short propagation delays, local area networks are characterized by a variable number of devices requiring interconnection. As more and more materials become available and the costs of operations skyrocket, library professionals have {{to come to terms with}} the facts that not only is there not enough money around to be self-sufficient but often any semblance of self-sufficiency has become an impossibility. As a consequence, computer networks such as linked LANs are playing an increasingly important role in library activities. NETWORKING: CHOOSING A LAN PATH TO INTERCONNECTION is the result of efforts to explore the processes involved in developing a framework for interconnecting disparate computer systems in use by SEFLIN members in an extended local area network (LAN) or linked LAN based on the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Reference Model promulgated by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). Within a multi-type library consortium such as SEFLIN, an extended local area network or linked LAN facilitates access to decision making data. A networking system such as Network Systems Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s HYPERbus which can be extended via private or public communications facilities such as Bell South T 1 transmission technology, compatible Timep 1 ex devices, and Microtel 2 ̆ 7 s LaserNet, a fiber optic transmission system, into an extended local area network or linked LAN is a mechanism for facilitating the accomplishment of this mission. Inasmuch as HYPERbus has been utilized since 1984 by the Broward County Main Library, the major reference and research facility of the Broward County Library System, and can provide maximum performance networking capabilities for high speed digital data communications applications, NETWORKING: CHOOSING A LAN PATH TO INTERCONNECTION examines the feasibility of using HYPERbus as the basis for an extended local area network linking two SEFLIN participants, namely, the Broward County Main Library and the Florida Atlantic University Library. Developed by Network Systems Corporation, HYPERbus is a local area network implemented by Broward County 2 ̆ 7 s Information Resources Management Division in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Presently, HYPERbus is used to link the Broward County Main Library, the Broward County Governmental Center, the Broward County Courthouse, and the new jail facility. A multi-drop coaxial cable based system which transmits data at speeds up to 10 M bps, HYPERbus features a flexible architecture capable of handling simultaneously diverse data rate, traffic types, and protocols and incorporating a variety of transmission media within the network. Moreover, HYPERbus can support extended span geographic distances using communication links. HYPERbus provides a data communications resource that is transparent to differences in communications media and equipment. As a consequence, network reconfiguration and expansion can be readily accomplished as new technologies, protocols, and user requirements emerge. The generic model developed in this dissertation for interconnecting two SEFLIN participants based on HYPERbus technology, however, is by no means exhaustive of all existing schemes; the field is presently so wide open that new schemes are being introduced constantly. Technological advances and economic pressures have stimulated interest in resource sharing through computer networking as an option for overcoming barriers in accessing information. The linking of computerized systems to enable one system to exchange data with another system is an essential and basic goal to any effective cooperative intersystem resource sharing effort. In this world of electronic communications, the future of computer networking which provides tailored data communications services to the user community is definitely on an upward climb as a consequence of such factors as competitive pricing, improved and faster transmission speeds, and conformance to standards devised by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). NETWORKING: CHOOSING A LAN PATH TO INTERCONNECTION deals with designing and implementing a computer network for resource sharing and is intended for technical service and public service staff of the Broward County Library System who are using the building blocks of a local area network and still appear to be somewhat mystified by its information capabilities as well as for those who are not yet doing so. This dissertation examines the history of library involvement with networking, briefly reviews the history of library networking and automation, presents examples of library use of networking, and provides the user with the basic information needed for understanding networking technology and terminology. Further, NETWORKING: CHOOSING A LAN PATH TO INTERCONNECTION proposes an enhanced role for the Broward County Library System as a community information provider by using an extended local area network or linked LAN to actively pursue, organize, and make available to present and potential library patrons a range of information resources never before offered in today 2 ̆ 7 s information based society...|$|R
