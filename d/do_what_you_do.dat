Rev. Edward Everett Hale addressed the school girls in his inimitable way, at once attractive and helpful.

2500|$|On May 6, 2015, Bateman and Ginnifer Goodwin were {{announced}} {{as having been}} cast, respectively in the roles of Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps. The filmmakers chose Bateman because they wanted an actor who could bring [...] "a funny yet heartfelt side" [...] with [...] "a wily, dry-witted sort of voice." [...] Bateman described his character as [...] "a crafty, sarcastic schemer," [...] remarking on the role's similarity to many other roles he had done since he was 12. He explained that he had said to the directors: [...] "'What kind of voice do you guys want me to do?' And they {{just looked at me}} like I was an idiot and said, 'Just <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> Just talk.'" ...|$|E

I know I oughtn't to say such things of my mother--she really is an exceptional person--but a woman should be something more than mind. My sisters could no more <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> than a lame duck can lead a ballet. I suppose it is because I have {{had to live with}} a lot of ailing women all my life that I feel as I do toward you. I worship your health and strength. I really do.

6000|$|Well, my dear friends, God shall judge you, not I. If {{little is}} given to a man little is {{required}} of him. But not nothing at all; because more than nothing was given him. A little {{is given to}} every man; and, therefore, a little is required of every man. And so, he who knew not his Master's will shall be beaten with few stripes. But he will be beaten with some stripes, because {{he ought to have}} known something, at least of his Master's will. If you were dumb animals, which can only follow their own lusts and passions, and must be what nature has made them, then your excuse would be good enough; but your excuse is not good now, just because you are men and women, and not dumb beasts, and, therefore, can rise above your natures, and conquer your lusts and passions, as they cannot, and can <b>do</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not like, because, though you dislike it, you know that it is right. And, therefore, God does not take that excuse which sinners make, that they have had no teaching. But what does he do to them? ...|$|E
