Most of their day-to-day affairs were performed by their uncle including the collection of tax. Everything was going on well until somebody out of jealousy told the kings that their uncle was not properly depositing the tax collected from Darrang District of Assam to the king. Heeding to the false allegation of that person, they had killed their uncle with a poisoned arrow. The uncle while dying cursed the two brothers that even they would be killed by the people very soon like he was. The next year the king Nyila and his brother Yonpu went to Mazbat to collect tax where they were misunderstood and {{were killed by the}} Bodos. They did not know the language properly and were misunderstood, actually they checked the collected items but the thread-rolls were not there, so they said that there is no [...] "Hu-tu-tu" [...] but the villagers couldn't understand it, with no option left the kings took out his sword and draw a long line on the grounds as they were trying to <b>draw</b> <b>thread</b> but the villagers mis-understood it as black magic.

50|$|The {{most basic}} kind of <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work is hemstitching. Drawn thread work {{is often used}} to {{decorate}} the trimmings of clothes or household linens.

50|$|Cutwork {{is related}} to <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work. In <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work, {{typically}} only the warp or weft threads are withdrawn (cut and removed), and the remaining threads in the resulting hole are bound in various ways. In other types of cutwork, both warp and weft <b>threads</b> may be <b>drawn.</b>|$|R

50|$|Drawn thread {{work is a}} form of counted-thread {{embroidery}} {{based on}} removing threads from the warp and/or the weft of a piece of even-weave fabric. The remaining threads are grouped or bundled together into a variety of patterns. The more elaborate styles of <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work use a variety of other stitches and techniques, but the <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> parts are their most distinctive element. It is also grouped as whitework embroidery because it was traditionally done in white thread on white fabric and is often combined with other whitework techniques.|$|R

5000|$|Hemstitch or hem-stitch is a {{decorative}} <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work or openwork hand-sewing technique for embellishing {{the hem of}} clothing or household linens. Unlike an ordinary hem, hemstitching can employ embroidery thread in a contrasting color {{so as to be}} noticeable.|$|R
50|$|In hemstitching, {{one or more}} <b>threads</b> are <b>drawn</b> out of {{the fabric}} {{parallel}} and next to the turned hem, and stitches bundle the remaining threads {{in a variety of}} decorative patterns while securing the hem in place.

50|$|Hand hemstitching can be imitated by a hemstitching machine {{which has}} a piercer that pierces holes into the fabric and two {{separate}} needles that sew the hole open.

5000|$|... 17th century Spanish Sol lace {{was a form}} of <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> {{work with}} {{circular}} patterns built up on a skeleton of woven threads.

50|$|Another {{embroidery}} {{style that}} combines <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work with needlelace techniques is Hedebo from Denmark, which originates {{from the area}} around Copenhagen and Roskilde. It uses techniques that are clearly distinct from reticella and traditional Italian neddlelace {{on the one hand}} and Hardanger on the other. It does make extensive use of buttonhole stitches, but they are done slightly differently than in Italian embroidery.|$|R

5000|$|This {{relatively}} easy type of <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work {{is created by}} weaving (or darning) the embroidering thread into the barelaid warp or weft threads to create patterns of light-colored threads and dark openings in the drawn-thread cloth.

50|$|Samplers {{were known}} to be used by stitchers in Europe as early as the {{beginning}} of the 16th century, although none that early have been found. A collection of fifty dechados (samplers) was listed in the 1509 inventory of the possessions of Queen Joanna (Juana I) (1479-1555) of Castile (Spain). They were described as stitchery and deshilado (<b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work), some in silk and others in gold thread. At the time of the inventory they were in the care of her chamberlain Diego de Rivera and his son Alonso, but they have all disappeared.|$|R
5000|$|Reticella lace {{is a form}} of {{embroidery}} {{in which}} typical techniques of needlelace are used to embellish <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work. It was first used in 16th century Italy. Needlelace evolved from this when the lacemakers realized that they can do the same things without any supporting fabric. High quality reticella is done with thread almost as thin as sewing silk. Ruskin lace is in fact a near-modern form of it. Warp and weft threads are removed, and the remaining threads are overcast with buttonhole stitches, as in needlelace.|$|R

Embroidery and <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work are done by hand to produce clothing, as well as tablecloths and other home textiles for sale in local crafts markets. A small but growing number of fine art galleries in Antananarivo, and several other urban areas, offer paintings by local artists, and annual art events, such as the Hosotra open-air exhibition in the capital, contribute to the continuing development {{of fine arts in}} Madagascar.|$|R

50|$|Embroidery {{can also}} be {{classified}} by the similarity of appearance. In <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work and cutwork, the foundation fabric is deformed or cut away to create holes that are then embellished with embroidery, often with thread in {{the same color as}} the foundation fabric. When created with white thread on white linen or cotton, this work is collectively referred to as whitework. However, whitework can either be counted or free. Hardanger embroidery is a counted embroidery and the designs are often geometric. Conversely, styles such as Broderie anglaise are similar to free embroidery, with floral or abstract designs that are not dependent on the weave of the fabric.|$|R
50|$|Hardanger {{embroidery}} is a {{style of}} <b>drawn</b> <b>thread</b> work that is most popular today. It originally comes from Norway, from the traditional district of Hardanger. The backbone of Hardanger designs consists of satin stitches. In geometrical areas both warp and weft threads are removed and the remaining mesh is secured with simple weaving or warping or with {{a limited number of}} simple filling patterns. The designs tend to be geometric, if they include flowers or such they are very stylized {{due to the nature of}} the technique. Hardanger never includes Buttonhole stitches, except for securing the edges of a piece of fabric. It is usually executed using rather coarse fabric and thread.|$|R

5000|$|A Dobby loom {{is a type}} {{of floor}} loom that {{controls}} all the warp threads using a device called a dobby. (The word dobby is a corruption of [...] "draw boy" [...] which refers to the weaver's helpers who used to control the warp thread by pulling on <b>draw</b> <b>threads.)</b> A dobby loom is an alternative to a treadle loom. Both are floor looms in which every warp thread on the loom is attached to a single shaft using a device called a heddle. A shaft is sometimes known as a harness. Each shaft controls a set of threads. Raising or lowering several shafts at the same time gives a huge variety of possible sheds (gaps) through which the shuttle containing the weft thread can be thrown.|$|R
