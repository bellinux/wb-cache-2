The next day, Sykes' superior Captain Warner (McCarthy), informs his squad that they will have to work with the newly promoted Newcomer detective Sam Francisco (Patinkin). Although biased, Sykes enlists to work with Francisco to investigate a similar homicide with a Newcomer named Warren Hubely, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he investigates that crime, he will also find opportunities to investigate his partner's death (which he is officially forbidden to do).|$|E

He has also compared the search for Laura's killer to the central narrative of the 1960s television series The Fugitive, which featured an ongoing search for a one-armed man. Contrasting the two, Lynch stated [...] "each week, you know, they [...] hardly ever dealt with that. And that's the beautiful thing. You keep wondering, 'When will he find this guy and set everything straight?' But then you knew it would be the end".|$|E

500|$|After From Russia with Love, Eon had {{considered}} undertaking {{an adaptation of}} either On Her Majesty's Secret Service or Casino Royale. They entered into negotiations with Charles K. Feldman, who held {{the rights to the}} latter, but a deal proved too difficult to achieve. Instead, Eon turned to the Thunderball novel. Although Eon had wanted to adapt the book in 1962, it had not been possible until the legal obstacles had been cleared. As a result of the settlement of the copyright infringement lawsuit brought by Kevin McClory, Eon negotiated with McClory to make Thunderball. McClory received the sole producer credit on the film, while Broccoli and Saltzman took the title Executive Producer, although [...] "in reality all three men would essentially act as producers". Broccoli later said of the three-way partnership that [...] "We didn't want anyone else to make Thunderball... We had the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> anyone else came in and made their own Bond film, it would have been bad for our series".|$|E

[...] In a demonstration of some half an hour, Bryan was carried around the floor, then surrounded with cheering supporters. [...] Men and women threw their hats into the air, not caring where they might come down. [...] Delegates were shouting to begin the vote and nominate Bryan immediately, which he refused to consider, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> his appeal could not last overnight, it would not last until November. [...] Bryan left the convention, returning to his hotel to await the outcome.

[...] Hanna became convinced that McKinley was the only Ohioan who could gain the nomination, and by telegram hinted that Sherman should withdraw in the congressman's favor as the only Ohio Republican with a chance at the presidency. [...] Sherman, believing this to be his best chance for election, refused, a decision which Hanna accepted, fighting for Sherman to the end. [...] Hanna was greatly impressed by McKinley's loyal conduct in refusing to begin a run himself. [...] Foraker threw his support to Blaine, though he returned to Sherman when the New Englander did not run. [...] In the end, the nomination fell to former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison. Hanna never forgave {{what he saw as}} Foraker's treason. [...] After 1888, there was a strong dislike between the two men, and the separation split the Ohio Republican Party into two factions, a rupture that did not heal until after Hanna's death in 1904. [...] Foraker stated in his memoirs that the break occurred because Hanna bribed black delegates from the South in 1888. [...] However, Ohio newspaper publisher J. B. Morrow contradicted Foraker's account, stating: [...] "I was at the convention in 1888 and know Senator Foraker [...] brought great scandal to the Ohio people who were there and to the delegates with his secret work with Mr. Blaine's friends... Mr. Hanna became thoroughly angered at what he thought was Senator Foraker's bad faith." [...] According to Horner, Foraker was the more embittered of the two as the years passed, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it had not been for that dispute, Foraker, not McKinley, might have become president.|$|E

500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of Born This Way, season ten American Idol {{contestant}} Haley Reinhart sang [...] "You and I" [...] as one of two performances for the [...] "Songs from Now and Then" [...] episode. Jimmy Iovine, head of Gaga's record label, asked for the song and Reinhart received her permission before the performance. Reviews of Reinhart's performance were mostly positive. Len Melisurgo of The Star-Ledger considered it a risky choice, since the song had not been released, but accepted that Reinhart [...] "sounded amazing" [...] by hitting [...] "some really high notes". Brian Mansfield of USA Today described Reinhart's performance as an [...] "old-fashioned dance-hall groove, kind of like a mid-'70s Elton John number. It's perfectly suited to that slippery growl that such a distinctive part of Haley's style. By the end of the song, she turns it into a gospel-style rocker, and she takes it to the house." [...] Mansfield also noted that the American Idol judges—Randy Jackson, Jennifer Lopez and Steven Tyler—reacted positively to it. On the contrary, Jim Farber of the New York Daily News considered the choice risky and was thankful when Reinhart performed a more familiar song for her second round. On May 5, 2011, Reinhart's studio recording of [...] "You and I" [...] was released as a digital single to the iTunes Store, and appeared on the compilation album American Idol Top 5 Season 10. Mansfield, who initially had misgivings about Reinhart as a singer, complimented her studio recording of the track, <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she could [...] "get another 10 songs this good {{when it comes time to}} cut the record, then all my initial misgivings about this girl will vanish into thin air." ...|$|E

And this meant that we had to shoot our scenes at breakneck speed so that the actors could get out on time. I couldn't help <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they'd been really conscientious, they'd have swallowed their sandwich in the cab, on the way to the theatre, and get there in time to put on their make-up and go on stage.

40|$|We {{seem to have}} {{a problem}} in arts {{education}} at pre-school level: the lack of specific training for teachers teaching this subject to very young children. The future preschool teachers’ training seems to be focused on the teaching and learning aspects of artistic education however they receive little training on methodologies and philosophies. Therefore, when teachers have to face the classroom, the methodologies they use are usually quite traditional and do not favour the development of critical thinking skills in the students. There are different philosophies of arts education that might embed opportunities for reflection, art interpretation, experimentation, expression of emotions and <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>if,</b> in the case these philosophies, reach the classroom, may doubtlessly enrich the student’s artistic training.

[...] Yahoo! Music's Gary Crossing referred to the album as [...] "a polished, well-produced yet largely undemanding collection of disco, Hi-NRG, Ibizan trance, funk, 60s film and TV themes and Latin-flavoured tunes which like the Minogue minx's attire leaves very little to the imagination." [...] He also opined that [...] "ou just get the <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> those concerned put as much effort into the songwriting as they did into the glossy album sleeve photo shoot things might have been a whole lot better."

But the best tracks have an engagingly bouncy quality and taken as a whole this is a much better record than most critics would like to admit."

2500|$|Earl Scruggs did not invent three-finger banjo playing; in fact, he {{said the}} three-finger style {{was the most common}} way to play the five-string banjo in his {{hometown}} in western North Carolina. An early influence was a local banjoist, DeWitt [...] "Snuffy" [...] Jenkins, who plucked in a finger style. According to banjoist and historian Tony Trischka, [...] "Jenkins came about as close as one could to Scruggs style without actually playing it". At age ten, when Scruggs first learned the technique, he recalled that he was at home in his room after a quarrel with his brother. He was idly playing a song called [...] "Reuben" [...] and suddenly realized that he was playing with three fingers, not two. [...] "That excited me to no end", he later recalled, and said he ran through the house repeatedly yelling [...] "I've got it". From there he devoted all his free time to perfecting his timing and to adding syncopation and variations to it. Controversy exists as to the actual origin of three-finger picking style. Don Reno, an eminent banjo player who also played this style and who knew Scruggs at that young age, described Scruggs' early playing as similar to that of Snuffy Jenkins. Scruggs, however, consistently referred to it as his own, saying that he adapted to it [...] "a syncopated roll that was quite different." [...] On the subject, John Hartford said, [...] "Here's the way I feel about it. Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three finger banjo pickers have been around a long time— maybe since 1840. But it's my <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't be worried about who invented it." ...|$|E

40|$|Fallibilism, {{the thesis}} that no belief can be known for certain, has become a popular view in epistemology. The {{certainty}} of our perceptions, inductions, faculties of reason, and even self-knowledge are regularly challenged. On this view, most of epistemology then deals with knowledge that is probably fallible. However, knowledge of our own primitive feelings may avert the likely fallibility of other sources of knowledge. In this paper I argue <b>that</b> primitive <b>feelings</b> are an infallible source of knowledge {{even in the face}} of the strongest fallibilist challenges, by exploring what kinds of things <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> believed, must be true. I address the matter first by determining what kinds of things <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> they are true, we must be justified in believing if and when we believe them. Next I determine what can be believed only if true. Then I show <b>that</b> primitive <b>feeling</b> fulfills both of these. Finally, since primitive feelings do fulfill these requirements, I show <b>that</b> <b>if</b> the <b>feelings</b> are believed then necessarily they are also known for certain. Then I address challenges that pose issues for self-knowledge and explain how they do not create real problems for primitive feelings even if they do for other kinds of self-knowledge. Through this process, I refine into a tightly understandable category what constitutes these sorts of <b>feelings</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> believable, are also infallibly knowable. From there we can come to know for certain some things about the world we exist in...|$|R
