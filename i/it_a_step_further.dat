Germanicus massacred the villages of the Marsi he encountered and pillaged the surrounding territory. On the way back to their winter quarters at Castra Vetera, they pushed successfully through the opposing tribes (Bructeri, Tubantes, and Usipetes) between the Marsi and the Rhine.|$|E

Because Gautier wrote so frequently on plays, {{he began to}} consider {{the nature of the}} plays and developed the criteria by which they should be judged.

Having abandoned the idea that tragedy is the superior genre, Gautier was willing to accept comedy as the equal of tragedy. Taking <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further,</b> he suggested that the nature of the theatrical effect should be in favour of creating fantasy rather than portraying reality because realistic theatre was undesirable.|$|E

On 11 December 2016, he netted a hat-trick in a 5–0 Serie A victory over Cagliari before taking <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> in the next match by scoring four goals in a 5–3 win over Torino. Mertens' four goals, which included the fourth fastest hat-trick in Serie A history, was the first haul scored by a Napoli player since Beppe Savoldi in 1977. It also saw him become {{the first player to}} score successive league hat-tricks since Juventus' Pietro Anastasi in 1974, and the first to score seven goals across two matches since Antonio Angelillo in 1958.

40|$|This chapter {{examines}} the diffusion and actual operation of regulatory reforms since the 1990 s in Turkey, focusing on national regulatory agencies (NRAs) in various sectors. <b>It</b> takes <b>a</b> <b>step</b> <b>further</b> from the mere initiation of regulatory reforms along with de jure institutional {{design of the}} NRAs and explores the actual processes through which NRAs function. It, then, finds out a considerable discrepancy between de jure design and de facto operation of the NRAs in terms of independence, accountability, and capacity to enforce; the extent of such discrepancy varies across sectors. The chapter specifically investigates the Competition Authority and NRAs in banking, telecommunications, energy, sugar, tobacco, and alcohol markets. It suggests that the operation of NRAs in practice may create new forms of rents, giving rise to significant distributive consequences...|$|R
