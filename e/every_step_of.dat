Negotiations began at the Moore House on October 18 between Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Dundas and Major Alexander Ross (who represented the British) and Lieutenant Colonel Laurens (who represented the Americans) and the Marquis de Noailles (who represented the French).

With their combined puppetry talents they managed <b>every</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> the process for each performance. Paul, with his skills, designed and built the puppet sets and marionettes. Edee created the puppets' scripts and their costumes. Paul had a separate 45' by 16' workshop studio that was part of their personal residence he added in 1952. In the studio he created the marionettes that were made from pine, which included the flexible wooden joints for the puppets. The marionette heads were from plaster wood. The rough block heads were individually crafted, specifically shaped, finished, painted up, and decorated with hair. His wife would add her custom-designed costumes just before being attached to an overhead controller by strings.|$|E
25|$|Viruses often mimic human SLiMs {{to hijack}} and disrupt a host's {{cellular}} machinery, thereby adding functionality to their compact genomes without necessitating new virally encoded proteins. In fact, many motifs were originally discovered in viruses, {{such as the}} Retinoblastoma binding LxCxE motif and the UEV domain binding PTAP late domain. The short generation times and high mutation rates of viruses, in association with natural selection, has led to multiple examples of mimicry of host SLiMs in <b>every</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> the viral life cycle (Src binding motif PxxP in Nef modulates replication, WW domain binding PPxY mediates budding in Ebola virus, A Dynein Light Chain binding motif in Rabies virus is vital for host infection). The extent of human SLiM mimicry is surprising with many viral proteins containing several functional SLiMs, for example, the Adenovirus protein E1A.|$|E

25|$|In the US, victims' rights {{include the}} right to have a victims {{advocate}} preside over <b>every</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> the medical/legal exam to ensure sensitivity towards victims, provide emotional support, and minimize the risk of re-traumatization. Victims are to be informed of this immediately by law enforcement or medical service providers. Emergency rooms of many hospitals employ sexual assault nurse/forensic examiners (SAN/FEs) with specific training to care for those who have experienced a rape or sexual assault. They are able to conduct a focused medical-legal exam. If such a trained clinician is not available, the emergency department has a sexual assault protocol that has been established for treatment and the collection of evidence. Staff are also trained to explain the examinations in detail, the documentation and the rights associated with the requirement for informed consent. Emphasis is placed on performing the examinations at a pace that is appropriate for the person, their family, their age, and their level of understanding. Privacy is recommended as is the prevention of self-harm.|$|E
25|$|Classical {{figures have}} not {{discussed}} {{the subject as}} it has only {{come up in the}} 19th century. Contemporaries have come up with several distinct stances. One stance is that adaptation, or evolution on a micro scale, is accepted within a species, but cross-species evolution, that is evolution from one species into another species, is not as the human beginning is considered to be miraculous. However, this traditional thought would not conflict with the view that human-like beings could have been created around the same time as human beings, which, in this view, would explain the fossil records that look human but are not. Another stance is that since evolution is the simplest explanation it is the most reasonable to accept under the condition that it is not random but occurs only with the permission of God <b>every</b> <b>step</b> <b>of</b> the way. One particular argument that supports the idea that evolution is possible is the one stating that in that the stages of human development in evolution are akin to the distinct stages of development acknowledged in the Koran. The final stance completely rejects cross-species evolution across all organisms, but approves of adaptation (micro evolution).|$|E
