5|$|Thyroid hormone is {{required}} for the normal functioning of numerous tissues in the body. In health, the thyroid gland predominantly secretes thyroxine (T4), which is converted into triiodothyronine (T3) in other organs by the selenium-dependent enzyme iodothyronine deiodinase. Triiodothyronine binds to the thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>receptor</b> in the nucleus of cells, where it stimulates the turning on of particular genes and the production of specific proteins. Additionally, the hormone binds to integrin αvβ3 on the cell membrane, thereby stimulating the sodium–hydrogen antiporter and processes such as formation of blood vessels and cell growth. In blood, almost all thyroid hormone (99.97%) is bound to plasma proteins such as thyroxine-binding globulin; only the free unbound thyroid hormone is biologically active.|$|E
5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating <b>hormone</b> <b>receptor.</b> These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and palpitations. Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{is destined}} to review the advances {{that had been made}} to study the role of thyroid hormone and thyroid <b>hormone</b> nuclear <b>receptors</b> in regulating the gene expression. Triiodothyronine (T 3) and tetraiodothyronine (thyroxine or T 4) are most important thyroid hormones. The thyroid hormones bind to their specific nuclear <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors,</b> as ligand, and play important role in gene expression and transcriptional gene regulation in human and higher animals. Thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors</b> form heterodimers by making combination with retinoid X receptors. The capability of heterodimerization of thyroid hormones generates novel complexes which allow altered specificity and higher affinity for DNA-receptor binding. Thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors</b> work as ligand activated transcription factor and play with transcriptional gene expression process.

40|$|Mechanisms {{controlling}} nuclear <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors</b> are {{a central}} question to mammalian developmental and disease processes. Herein, {{we show that}} a subtle increase in O-GlcNAc levels inhibits activation of nuclear <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors.</b> In vivo, increased levels of O-GlcNAc impair estrogen receptor activation and cause a decrease in mammary ductal side-branching morphogenesis associated with loss of progesterone receptors. Increased O-GlcNAc levels suppress transcriptional expression of coactivators and of the nuclear <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors</b> themselves. Surprisingly, increased O-GlcNAc levels are also associated with increased transcription of genes encoding corepressor proteins NCoR and SMRT. The association of the enzyme O-GlcNAc transferase with these corepressors contributes to specific regulation of nuclear <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors</b> by O-GlcNAc. Overall, transcriptional inhibition {{is related to the}} integrated effect of O-GlcNAc by direct modification of critical elements of the transcriptome and indirectly through O-GlcNAc modification of the proteasome...|$|R

These chemicals are known to cause endocrine disruption via a few different mechanisms. While the mechanism associated with the thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>receptor</b> is not well understood, two more established mechanisms involve the inhibition of the androgen receptor and activation of the estrogen receptor.|$|E
25|$|Several {{molecular}} isoforms of GH {{exist in}} the pituitary gland and are released to blood.

This variant has not been identified, {{but it has been}} suggested to coincide with a 22 kDa glycosylated variant of 23 kDa identified in the pituitary gland. Furthermore, these variants circulate partially bound to a protein (growth hormone-binding protein, GHBP), which is the truncated part of the growth <b>hormone</b> <b>receptor,</b> and an acid-labile subunit (ALS).|$|E

25|$|Findings have {{suggested}} that thyroid hormone (T4) is {{taken up by the}} hypothalamic glial cells in the infundibular nucleus/ median eminence, and that it is here converted into T3 by the type 2 deiodinase (D2). Subsequent to this, T3 is transported into the thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)-producing neurons in the paraventricular nucleus. Thyroid hormone receptors have been found in these neurons, indicating that they are indeed sensitive to T3 stimuli. In addition, these neurons expressed MCT8, a thyroid hormone transporter, supporting the theory that T3 is transported into them. T3 could then bind to the thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>receptor</b> in these neurons and affect the production of thyrotropin-releasing hormone, thereby regulating thyroid hormone production.|$|E
25|$|A {{molecular}} {{mechanism for}} non-genomic signaling through the nuclear thyroid <b>hormone</b> <b>receptor</b> TRβ involves the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). This signaling can be {{blocked by a}} single tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution in TRβ without disrupting direct gene regulation. When mice were created with this single, conservative amino acid substitution in TRβ, synaptic maturation and plasticity in the hippocampus was impaired almost as effectively as completely blocking thyroid hormone synthesis. This mechanism appears to be conserved in all mammals but not in TRα or any other nuclear receptors. Thus, phosphotyrosine-dependent association of TRβ with PI3K provides a potential mechanism for integrating regulation of development and metabolism by thyroid hormone and receptor tyrosine kinases. In addition, thyroid hormone signaling through PI3K can alter gene expression.|$|E
25|$|Estradiol acts {{primarily}} as an agonist of the estrogen receptor (ER), a nuclear steroid <b>hormone</b> <b>receptor.</b> There are two subtypes of the ER, ERα and ERβ, and estradiol potently binds to and activates {{both of these}} receptors. The result of ER activation is a modulation of gene transcription and expression in ER-expressing cells, which is the predominant mechanism by which estradiol mediates its biological effects in the body. Estradiol also acts as an agonist of membrane estrogen receptors (mERs), such as GPER (GPR30), a recently discovered non-nuclear receptor for estradiol, via which it can mediate a variety of rapid, non-genomic effects. Unlike {{the case of the}} ER, GPER appears to be selective for estradiol, and shows very low affinities for other endogenous estrogens, such as estrone and estriol. Additional mERs besides GPER include ER-X, ERx, and Gq-mER.|$|E

In spite of excellent glucose and blood pressure control, including administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and/or angiotensin II receptor blockers, diabetic nephropathy still develops and progresses. The development of additional protective therapeutic interventions is, therefore, a major priority. Nuclear <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors</b> regulate carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, the immune response, and inflammation. These receptors also modulate the development of fibrosis. As a result of their diverse biological effects, nuclear <b>hormone</b> <b>receptors</b> have become major pharmaceutical targets for the treatment of metabolic diseases.
