5|$|An {{equilibrium}} between electrons, positrons and photons {{was maintained}} <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> {{of the evolution}} of the Universe. After 15 seconds had passed, however, the temperature of the universe dropped below the threshold where electron-positron formation could occur. Most of the surviving electrons and positrons annihilated each other, releasing gamma radiation that briefly reheated the universe.|$|E
5|$|The {{follicular}} {{phase is}} {{the first part of}} the ovarian cycle. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> the ovarian follicles mature and get ready to release an egg. The latter part of this phase overlaps with the proliferative phase of the uterine cycle.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near the end of each stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At the end of each instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E

25|$|End Phase: If {{the player}} {{has more than}} six cards in their hand, they must discard cards until they have six. <b>This</b> <b>phase</b> also exists for card effects that {{activate}} or resolve <b>during</b> <b>this</b> specific <b>phase</b> and maintenance costs. Once <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> is resolved, the player ends their turn.|$|R
50|$|For a semi-claustral species, {{which is}} an ant that {{requires}} food <b>during</b> <b>this</b> nesting <b>phase,</b> protein rich foods should be provided intermittently during the pre-worker phase, with the frequency and type of food determined by the specific species of ant.|$|R
5|$|Progressive {{deterioration}} eventually hinders independence, with subjects {{being unable}} to perform most common activities of daily living. Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary, which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions (paraphasias). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost. Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives. Long-term memory, which was previously intact, becomes impaired.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} shown that during the luteal phase woman consume more carbohydrates, {{proteins}} and fats and that 24-hour energy expenditure shows increases between 2.5-11.5%. The increasing intake during the luteal phase may be related to higher preferences for sweet and fatty foods, which occurs naturally and is enhanced during the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle. This is due to the higher metabolic demand <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase.</b> In particular, women tend to show a cravings for chocolate, with higher cravings during the luteal phase.|$|E
5|$|A {{specialized}} test train, Dasye set744 in a commemorative livery, {{arrived to}} conduct the fourth phase of testing, which began on 28 September 2015. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> more than 200 test runs would be performed on the line. The test runs would test ride smoothness, performance of the catenary, radio communications, and the signalling system. During some runs, the test train would operate at 10% above the planned operational speeds for the line when it enters service. Some automated safety systems were disabled to allow the test train to operate beyond normal operating conditions. Orientation training for operators was scheduled to take place between January and March 2016 {{prior to the start}} of commercial service on the line, which was scheduled for 3 April 2016 at the time of the accident. In January 2016, SNCF announced that the opening of the line would be delayed until to 3 July 2016.|$|E

5|$|An unusually small hurricane, with gale-force winds {{extending}} only 60mi (95km) {{from its}} center, Danny {{was prone to}} significant fluctuations in intensity, making forecasts particularly difficult. Indeed, the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non-existent upper-level wind shear. Low-level moisture wrapped around the circulation <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> mitigating {{the influence of the}} Saharan Air Layer. Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12:00UTC on August21 as a Category3 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125mph (205km/h) alongside a barometric pressure of 960mbar (hPa); 28.35inHg). Shortly thereafter, increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase. The storm's eye became obscured by clouds and disappeared from satellite image late on August21.|$|E
5|$|Before a {{translation}} is greenlit and translators are allocated for each language, the localization, quality assurance (QA) and marketing staff play through a build {{of the game}} and sometimes do a focus group study. The localization team's playthrough can sometimes take over 100 hours of gameplay. Once the company greenlights a localization project, a period of brainstorming starts in which glossary, style, naming schemes and fonts are chosen. During the translation phase, voiced sections are translated first. Text files are cross-checked by multiple translators and editors. The text is then integrated along with any graphic and sound changes, and the game goes to quality assurance. During a period of several weeks to up to three months, Japanese QA teams look for bugs while Western QA teams check linguistic issues. The localization team often re-plays the game <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> translates the manuals and help out on the guidebooks if these are made. Finally, the game is sent to the hardware manufacturers to be approved.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Americans felt that they were better {{prepared}} to deliver destruction to the trail system. During Commando Hunt III (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> of the campaign by an estimated 743 anti-aircraft weapons. This increased number of aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with cluster bomb units (CBUs), the fighter bombers were poised to pounce upon any enemy anti-aircraft positions identified by other aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Concept {{development}} for the game began with a small team in 2009. <b>During</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> the unique gameplay mechanic of Link merging onto walls was prototyped. However, development suffered several setbacks with production of the game ceasing entirely in late 2010, as core team members were reassigned to different projects. A year later, development restarted and after several failed pitches to series creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, the game entered full production in 2012. Changing the established conventions of the series became a goal for the game's designers; {{this led to a}} change in the game's structure, allowing players to tackle and clear the majority of dungeons in any order they choose, and the introduction of the item rental system.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fourth}} phase, low-lying casemates {{were added to}} the western and southwestern {{curtains}} to provide an additional platform for al-Rahba's defenders to use. The walls, particularly on the eastern side, were reinforced in the fifth phase, which Paillet attributes to the efforts of Shirkuh II and his Ayyubid contemporaries to strengthen the fortresses of Syria. The building technique used in this phase likely necessitated significant funds, equipment and technical expertise. Several changes were made including the southeastern tower being rebuilt and the northeastern tower being reinforced by an additional wall and a vaulted story. Moreover, the northern slope of the outer wall was further strengthened with a glacis built from large conglomerate blocks. A building in the center of al-Rahba was erected <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> likely replacing an older structure or a courtyard.|$|E
5|$|Some of the Kentish crowds now dispersed, {{but others}} continued. From this point, {{they appear to}} have been led by Wat Tyler, whom the Anonimalle Chronicle {{suggests}} was elected their leader at a large gathering at Maidstone on 7 June. Relatively little is known about Tyler's former life; chroniclers suggest that he was from Essex, had served in France as an archer and was a charismatic and capable leader. Several chroniclers believe that he was responsible for shaping the political aims of the revolt. Some also mention a Jack Straw as a leader among the Kentish rebels <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> in the revolt, but it is uncertain if this was a real person, or a pseudonym for Wat Tyler or John Wrawe.|$|E

5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the closeness of the fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a steep slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position early in the evening.|$|E
5|$|The {{highest ranking}} {{casualty}} of this engagement was Gen. Heth, who {{was struck by}} a bullet in the head. He was apparently saved because he had stuffed wads of paper into a new hat, which was otherwise too large for his head. But there were two consequences to this glancing blow. Heth was unconscious for over 24 hours and had no further command involvement in the three-day battle. He was also unable to urge Pender's division to move forward and supplement his struggling assault. Pender was oddly passive <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> of the battle; the typically more aggressive tendencies of a young general in Lee's army would have seen him move forward on his own accord. Hill shared the blame for failing to order him forward as well, but he claimed illness. History cannot know Pender's motivations; he was mortally wounded the next day and left no report.|$|E

5|$|The {{second phase}} occurs between 24h and 72h {{following}} overdose {{and consists of}} signs of increasing liver damage. In general, damage occurs in liver cells as they metabolize the paracetamol. The individual may experience right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The increasing liver damage also changes biochemical markers of liver function; International normalized ratio (INR) and the liver transaminases ALT and AST rise to abnormal levels. Acute kidney failure may also occur <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase,</b> typically caused by either hepatorenal syndrome or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In some cases, acute kidney failure may be the primary clinical manifestation of toxicity.

Throughout September the Germans began to withdraw back towards the Hindenburg Line and the 3rd Division took part in the operations undertaken to follow them up and harass the rearguard. Casualties <b>during</b> <b>this</b> <b>phase</b> had been high, however, and as a result the division's pioneers were used as infantry and even led the advance towards Buire on 6 September.|$|E
