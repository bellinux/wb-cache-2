5|$|Liz {{attempts}} to make amends by talking to Tracy during a rehearsal, during which she makes negative remarks about Jenna {{and the other members}} of her staff. Liz is notified by Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) that her chat with Tracy was aired over the studio's monitors, which meant that everyone heard and saw her making the comments. Liz's staff show their displeasure by throwing food and other objects at her. Liz and Tracy discuss an idea to get everyone together to try and smooth things over, and Tracy decides to invite Liz and the staff to a party aboard a yacht. Tracy gets along well with everyone at the party, including Jenna, and things appear to be <b>going</b> <b>very</b> well. Liz soon discovers that the yacht does not belong to Tracy, and the yacht's real owner shows up with the NYPD. The following day Liz learns that Jack paid the newspapers to keep Tracy out of the press but left a photo of Jenna passing out on the yacht in their pages, which Jenna sees as exciting and flattering.|$|E
25|$|On {{the opening}} night {{the play is}} <b>going</b> <b>very</b> well. In his {{dressing}} room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife Sylvia that several years ago he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about his inner Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia wishes him luck and leaves the room, Riggan picks up a real gun and checks that it is loaded for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on-stage. The play receives a standing ovation as Tabitha rushes out to file copy.|$|E
25|$|Modern {{scholarship}} generally describes Ammianus as a pagan who was {{tolerant of}} Christianity. Marcellinus writes of Christianity {{as being a}} pure and simple religion that demands only what is just and mild, and when he condemns the actions of Christians, he does not do so {{on the basis of}} their Christianity as such. His lifetime was marked by lengthy outbreaks of sectarian and dogmatic strife within the new state-backed faith, often with violent consequences (especially the Arian controversy) and these conflicts sometimes appeared unworthy to him, though it was territory where he could not risk <b>going</b> <b>very</b> far in criticism, due to the growing and volatile political connections between the church and imperial power.|$|E

25|$|At Martinsville, Kenseth {{came into}} a turn <b>going</b> <b>very</b> fast, causing {{his car to}} wheel-hop. He hit Kevin Harvick hard, who's still in the Chase, causing Harvick to spin. Harvick hit the wall hard and fell 42 laps back. After hitting Harvick, a {{sideways}} Kenseth was bumped by Tony Stewart and straightened Kenseth out of his spin with no more damage. Laps later, after Harvick {{had returned to the}} track, he saw Kenseth coming behind him. Harvick, purposely checked-up trying to smash up Kenseth's radiator. Kenseth saw what Harvick was doing and checked-up enough to avoid serious damage. Kenseth still finished in 6th place and is in 4th place of the Chase. Harvick finished in 33rd putting Kenseth 28 points down and swore that if this race is the cause of him not making it further into the Chase, {{that he was going to}} cause Kenseth not to make it either.|$|E
25|$|However, in sunny {{conditions}} {{and on a}} good batting track, India found the <b>going</b> <b>very</b> easy. Admittedly Dabengwa dropped a hard catch off Virender Sehwag on 5, and Sehwag made the Zimbabweans pay, pounding six fours and one six in a 44 before Mahwire found a way through his defences at the stroke of lunch. India had added 88 for the first wicket, however, and although Gautam Gambhir departed for 46 shortly after lunch, the foundation was laid down. Rahul Dravid was back to his form from before the one-day series, and VVS Laxman also survived a tricky period to hit his eighth Test century. Mahwire added yet another wicket to his tally, as he lured Dravid into an edge that fell into Brendan Taylor's hands, but Laxman pounded Zimbabwe's bowlers in the evening session, giving them a relatively comfortable lead of 46 runs at stumps on day two.|$|E

500|$|Location {{scouting}} {{revealed a}} former Wall Street bank {{that had been}} closed down and repurposed as a cigar bar. [...] The building stood in for the fictional Manhattan Trust Bank branch, where the bank heist occurs. [...] "Without a bank, we didn’t have a movie," [...] Lee explained. [...] "But everything ended up <b>going</b> <b>very</b> smoothly. We shot {{in the heart of}} Wall Street in a bank that had been closed down. It was like having a back lot in the middle of Wall Street." [...] An office at the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House doubled as the office of Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer). Plummer believed that the office's design was essential to his character: [...] "The space literally presents Case’s power, so I found that part of my character was to simply play very cool about everything. You don’t have to push the power, because it’s all around you." [...] The location was also used to film a scene where Frazier confronts Madeleine White (Jodie Foster). The American Tract Society building, located at 150 Nassau Street and Spruce Street, Manhattan, doubled as White's office. Cafe Bravo, a coffee shop located at 76 Beaver Street and Hanover Street, was also used for filming. Other filming locations included Battery Park and the New York Supreme Court House's Appellate Division located at East 25th Street and Madison Avenue, Manhattan.|$|E

[...] The conductor then jumped himself, just before the car struck the wooden gate before the open draw. [...] He saw a number people jump off the car.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, {{in order}} to ensure Egypt's support of the war effort, which {{initially}} seemed to be <b>going</b> <b>very</b> badly for the Allies, Britain replaced the Egyptian government with one whose cooperation it could be sure of. [...] Martial law was imposed, and in 1941 some public figures that Britain considered subversive were arrested. [...] Hassan al-Banna was imprisoned twice (only to be released within weeks), the Brotherhood's journals were suppressed, its meetings were banned and any reference to it in newspapers was forbidden.|$|E

All of Elisabeth's children attended a four-day summer camp organised by firefighters, with 4,000 other young campers, in August 2008.

2500|$|The French-educated Isma'il Pasha greatly admired Europe as {{the model}} for {{excellence}} in everything, being an especially passionate Italophile and Francophile, saying {{at the beginning of his}} reign: [...] "My country is no longer in Africa, it is now in Europe". [...] Isma'il was a Muslim who loved Italian wine and French champagne, and many of his more conservative subjects in Egypt and the Sudan felt alienated by a regime that was determined to Westernize the country with little regard for tradition. The languages of Khedive's court were Turkish and French, not Arabic. The Khedive's great dream was to make Egypt culturally a part of Europe, and he spent huge sums of money attempting to modernize and Westernize Egypt, in the process <b>going</b> <b>very</b> deeply into debt.|$|E

2500|$|In 1896, the British Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, was {{concerned}} with keeping France out of the Horn of Africa. A French expedition {{under the command of}} Jean-Baptiste Marchand had left Dakar in March 1896 with the aim of conquering the Sudan, seizing control of the Nile as it flowed into Egypt, and forcing the British out of Egypt; thus restoring Egypt to the place within the French sphere of influence that it had had prior to 1882. Salisbury feared that if the British did not conquer the Sudan, the French would. He had supported Italy's ambitions to conquer Ethiopia {{in the hope that the}} Italians would keep the French out of Ethiopia. The Italian attempt to conquer Ethiopia, however, was <b>going</b> <b>very</b> badly by early 1896, and ended with the Italians being annihilated at the Battle of Adowa in March 1896. In March 1896, with the Italians visibly failing and the Mahdiyah state threatening to conquer Eritrea, Salisbury ordered Kitchener to invade northern Sudan, ostensibly for the purpose of distracting the Ansar (whom the British called [...] "Dervishes") from attacking the Italians.|$|E

The cavalry had been ordered forward from Moralncourt at [...] but found the <b>going</b> <b>very</b> difficult, the ground being wet and cut trenches and shell-holes. The Secunderabad Cavalry Brigade took until the afternoon to reach Montauban and at [...] Rawlinson ordered the 7th Division to capture High Wood. Horne countermanded the order because of the situation at Longueval and the XIII Corps held back the cavalry, apart from patrols. The attack of the 21st and 1st divisions also proved abortive because of the German party in the north-west corner of Bazentin le Petit Wood and increasing German artillery-fire. A German counter-attack at [...] reduced the infantry of the 62nd Brigade to [...] and made the rest of the 21st Division incapable of attacking.|$|E
