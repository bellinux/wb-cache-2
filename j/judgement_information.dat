40|$|Colour is an {{important}} attribute for image matching and retrieval, and relevance feedback (RF) {{has been found to}} improve the retrieval effectiveness in information retrieval systems significantly. In this paper, we propose a new approach for colour-based RF for image retrieval. The approach makes use of the Multi-Interval Discretization Algorithm to discretize the range of colour histogram values into discrete colour intervals. The probabilistic 0. 5 formula is adapted to identify significant colour intervals which are then used to refine the initial query. In addition, knowledge is extracted from the relevance <b>judgement</b> <b>information</b> and represented as a Colour Interval Decision Tree. The decision tree is used to aid in classifying the images, retrieved using the modified query in subsequent retrieval, into the relevant and nonrelevant sets. Extensive tests on a large image collection were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed RF approach. 1...|$|E
40|$|Relevance {{feedback}} is the retrieval task where {{the system is}} given not only an information need, but also some relevance <b>judgement</b> <b>information,</b> usually from users ’ feedback for an initial result list by the system. With different amount of feedback information available, the optimal feedback strategy might be very different. In TREC Relevance Feedback task, the system is given different sets of feedback information from 1 relevant document to over 40 judgements with at least 3 relevant. Thus, in this work, we try to develop a feedback algorithm that works well on all levels of feedback by extending the relevance model for pseudo relevance feedback to include judged relevant documents when scoring feedback terms. Within these different levels of feedback, {{it is more difficult}} for the feedback algorithm to perform well when given minimal amount of feedback. Experiments show that our algorithm performs robustly in those difficult cases. ...|$|E

Different query-level weighting strategies are examined against two transfer ranking frameworks: AdaRank and a new weighted LambdaMART algorithm. Our experimental results show that the effectiveness of different weighting strategies, including those shown in past work, vary under different transferring environments. In particular, (i) Kullback-Leibler based density-ratio estimation tends to outperform a classification-based approach and (ii) aggregating document-level weights into query-level weights is likely superior to direct estimation using a query-level representation.

Aims: This study explored the factors influencing judgements regarding suicide risk in psychiatrists and nurses working in acute psychiatric in-patient units in Scotland. Method: Clinical <b>judgement</b> analysis. <b>Information</b> used by 12 psychiatrists and 52 nurses to make judgements about suicide risk were analysed over 130 hypothetical cases. Correlations and linear regression analysis were used to examine <b>judgement</b> consistency and <b>information</b> use. Results: There was agreement between clinicians on the relative but not absolute degree of risk of each patient case. Consistency of judgments was low, particularly amongst nurses. All clinicians rated those with more previous suicide attempts, men, those with shorter admission times, {{and those who were}} less compliant and not improving clinically as at greater risk of suicide. Conclusions: Clinicians use cues that have been associated with suicide in traditional predictive models based on epidemiological studies and short term factors that may be particularly relevant to acute psychiatric settings. The inconsistencies observed can be interpreted to cast doubt on the validity of predictions of risk for imminent suicide and the role of such predictions in the assessment process...|$|R

40|$|Bureaucracy Reform is a {{national}} program consists of three pillars; organization structure and design, business processes, and human resources. Since government is a huge complex system with hierarchy, formal and rigid rules, therefore to succeed the reform, it must be executed gradually but systematically, consistently, and seriously (Effendi, 2009). With this conception, organizational performance evaluation for government organization becomes an essential tool supporting the continuity and the consistency of reforms as evaluation provides <b>judgement</b> and <b>information</b> {{of where we are}} now - the present performance, and hence would assist to find what next steps to run for achieving the better performance suitable to the final goal.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} evaluation methods {{based on}} the use of non-dichotomous relevance <b>judgements</b> in <b>information</b> retrieval (IR) experiments. It is argued that evaluation methods should credit IR methods for their ability to retrieve highly relevant documents. This is deskable from the user's point of view in modem large IR environments. The proposed methods are (1) a novel application of P-R curves and average precision computations based on separate recall bases for documents of different degrees of relevance, and (2) two novel measures computing the cumulated gain the user obtains by examining the retrieval result up to a given ranked position. We then demonstrate the use of these evaluation methods in a case study on the effectiveness of query types, based on combinations of query structures and expansion, in retrieving documents of various degrees of relevance. Query expansion is based on concepts, which are selected from a conceptual model, and then expanded by semantic relationships given in the model. The test is run with a best match retrieval system (inQuery) in a text database consisting of newspaper articles...|$|R
