50|$|The <b>flyback</b> <b>converter</b> is an {{isolated}} power converter. The two prevailing control schemes are {{voltage mode control}} and current mode control (in {{the majority of cases}} current mode control needs to be dominant for stability during operation). Both require a signal related to the output voltage. There are three common ways to generate this voltage. The first is to use an optocoupler on the secondary circuitry to send a signal to the controller. The second is to wind a separate winding on the coil and rely on the cross regulation of the design. The third consists on sampling the voltage amplitude on the primary side, during the discharge, referenced to the standing primary DC voltage.|$|E
50|$|This voltage is not {{directly}} produced by the main power supply circuitry; instead the receiver makes use of the circuitry used for horizontal scanning. Direct current (DC), is switched though the line output transformer, and alternating current (AC) is induced into the scan coils. At {{the end of each}} horizontal scan line the magnetic field, which has built up in both transformer and scan coils by the current, is a source of latent electromagnetic energy. This stored collapsing magnetic field energy can be captured. The reverse flow, short duration, (about 10% of the line scan time) current from both the line output transformer and the horizontal scan coil is discharged again into the primary winding of the flyback transformer by the use of a rectifier which blocks this negative reverse emf. A small value capacitor is connected across the scan switching device. This tunes the circuit inductances to resonate at a much higher frequency. This slows down (lengthens) the flyback time from the extremely rapid decay rate that would result if they were electrically isolated during this short period. One of the secondary windings on the flyback transformer then feeds this brief high voltage pulse to a Cockcroft-Walton generator design voltage multiplier. This produces the required EHT supply. A <b>flyback</b> <b>converter</b> is a power supply circuit operating on similar principles.|$|E
