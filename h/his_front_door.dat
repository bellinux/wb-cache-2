5|$|Sheriff Tate {{arrives and}} discovers that Bob Ewell has {{died during the}} fight. The sheriff argues with Atticus about the {{prudence}} and ethics of charging Jem (whom Atticus believes to be responsible) or Boo (whom Tate believes to be responsible). Atticus eventually accepts the sheriff's story that Ewell simply fell on his own knife. Boo asks Scout to walk him home, and after she says goodbye to him at <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> he disappears again. While standing on the Radley porch, Scout imagines life from Boo's perspective, and regrets {{that they had never}} repaid him for the gifts he had given them.|$|E
25|$|Savile {{lived in}} Salford from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s, the later period with Ray Teret, who became his support DJ, {{assistant}} and chauffeur. Savile managed the Plaza Ballroom on Oxford Road, Manchester, in the mid-1950s. When {{he lived in}} Great Clowes Street in Higher Broughton, Salford, he was often seen sitting on <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> steps. He managed the Mecca Locarno ballroom in Leeds in the late 1950s and early 1960s {{as well as the}} Mecca-owned Palais dance hall in Ilford, Essex, between 1955 and 1956. His Monday evening records-only dance sessions (admission one shilling) were popular with local teens.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the bodies}} of the four men were found in the {{vicinity}} of Port's flat in just over a year from late summer 2014, Walgate (the first) outside <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> and the other three in a graveyard, the Metropolitan Police neglected to link the deaths. The first three victims (Kovari and Whitworth being the others) were initially thought not to have died in suspicious circumstances, and despite the PinkNews website and the force's LGBT independent advisory group correctly believing there was a serial murderer at large, the police had told them the crimes were not linked. The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) is now investigating whether 17 police officers in the Met should face disciplinary action.|$|E

25|$|On October 5, 2008, Anthony Limon {{had agreed}} {{as a favor}} to Torres to drive four men in his Hummer {{limousine}} that night, picking up the first three and taking them to the Elephant Bar restaurant in suburban Lakewood, where they picked up Saenz. Later, he ordered Limon to drive to Montebello, then at 5 a.m. ordered him to drive to the limo owner's home in Whittier. Saenz was filmed on a home surveillance system arriving at Torres' house, chasing him out of <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and then shooting Torres four times in the head, possibly due to lost money. The DVD disc that had captured the shooting was removed from the surveillance system. However, shortly after the investigation of the homicide, video of the murder was retrieved from the security equipment's hard drive, leading investigators to identify Saenz as the shooter.|$|E
500|$|The newly {{established}} band {{embark on a}} tour to Chicago, though Nat discovers that The Gold Boulders is their opening act. The Gold Boulders start the show with [...] "Boys Rule, Girls Drool" [...] and are immediately booed off the stage. After their performance, The Naked Brothers Band perform [...] "Hardcore Wrestlers (with Inner Feelings)" [...] and [...] "Rosalina", which are greeted with a loud applause from the audience. After the concert, Nat hosts a party for the band in his apartment. In {{the midst of the}} party, David, Thomas, and Josh arrive at <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door,</b> asking to join the reconstructed band. Forgivingly, a surprised Nat welcomes them to join the celebration. The film concludes with the outfit performing [...] "Crazy Car" [...] {{on the roof of the}} Wolffs' apartment while fireworks detonate in the background.|$|E
500|$|Davis formed up {{his company}} and {{ordered them to}} march at about 7 a.m. According {{to his wife and}} other witnesses, shortly after {{stepping}} off, Davis ordered his company to halt, then returned to <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> to tell his wife, [...] "Take good care of the children." [...] Soon after crossing into Concord, the Acton company passed the farm of Colonel James Barrett who commanded the provincial troops in Concord that morning. A small detachment of British soldiers were searching Barrett's farm for supplies, and Davis considered attacking them. [...] His orders, however, were to muster {{with the rest of the}} provincial militia and Minutemen near the Old North Bridge by the Concord River. [...] He then diverted his company off the road, avoiding the British at Barrett's farm and marching past a tavern belonging to a Widow Brown. [...] A boy named Charles Handley, who lived at Widow Brown's Tavern, saw Davis's company pass the tavern. He recalled many years later that a fifer and drummer played a song called [...] "The White Cockade", a reference to the white ribbon worn on their bonnets by Scots revolutionaries during The '45. [...] Tradition persists that this was Davis's favorite marching song, but there is little evidence to support this notion. [...] There is also a tradition that the Acton musicians played the White Cockade later when Davis's company led the advance on the British at the Old North Bridge, although this too is not supported by primary source accounts.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2016, an Oberlin professor, Joy Karega, blamed Israel for the Charlie Hebdo {{attacks and}} for ISIS, {{prompting}} a rebuke from faculty and administration. After {{five and a}} half months of discussion, the school suspended and then fired her.

2500|$|As {{described}} in , an apocryphal {{account in the}} 1687 Nordhausen Gesangbuch (Nordhausen songbook) records that the hymn text was written by Samuel Rodigast in 1675 while his friend, the cantor Severus Gastorius, whom he knew from school and university, was [...] "seriously ill" [...] and confined to his bed in Jena. The account credits Gastorius, believing himself {{to be on his}} death bed, with composing the hymn melody as music for his funeral. When Gastorius recovered, he instructed his choir in Jena to sing the hymn each week [...] "at <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> ... to make it better known." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 14 September: a {{high-ranking}} UVF member (John Bingham) {{was shot dead}} by the IRA at his home, Ballysillan, Belfast. Two IRA men, armed with a rifle and a revolver, used an axe to smash down <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door</b> before shooting him in both legs. The UVF man managed {{to make his way}} to an upstairs bedroom before being shot three more times. The IRA later released a statement saying: [...] "Relying on accurate intelligence reports we were able to pinpoint the whereabouts of UVF murder-gang leader John Bingham, who after a period of intensive activities which resulted in the deaths of five innocent Catholics, had just in the last number of weeks felt safe to return home." ...|$|E
2500|$|He later {{claimed to}} police {{that he was}} being {{followed}} and that threats were being made against him, with strangers banging on <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Doubting the story but aware that he was an aide to the Prince of Wales, the police set up a secret CCTV camera to verify his testimony. Though he continued to make allegations, the police tapes showed that no-one was following him or banging on his door. The police then approached the Prince's staff in St. James's Palace in London and warned that unless Smith received help he would be prosecuted for [...] "wasting police time". The Prince paid for him to attend The Priory, a famous British drink and drug treatment centre frequented by rock stars such as Robbie Williams and prominent people in the aristocracy, the media and the public eye.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2013, Underwood {{spoke out}} with disapproval {{regarding}} the Tennessee [...] "Ag Gag bill". The bill {{makes it a}} crime to videotape animal cruelty or abuse and then fail to turn in the evidence to authorities within 48 hours. This is to stop animal rights activists from accumulating enough documentation to prove that animal cruelty is routine in big agribusiness. Underwood tweeted, [...] "Shame on TN lawmakers for passing the Ag Gag bill. If Gov. Bill Haslam signs this, he needs to expect me at <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> Who's with me?" [...] State Rep. Andy Holt responded to her tweet, saying, [...] "I would say that Carrie Underwood will stick to singing, I'll stick to lawmaking." [...] Underwood later responded via Twitter, [...] "I should stick to singing? Wow…sorry, I’m just a tax paying citizen concerned for the safety of my family. #NoAgGag". She also tweeted Tennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, saying [...] "Please don't sign the Ag Gag bill. Think about the welfare of the animals as well as the consumers. I'm begging you..." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ware and Marsh {{searched for}} a vocalist, but their first choice, Glenn Gregory, was {{unavailable}} (Gregory eventually became the lead singer of their later band Heaven 17). Ware then decided to invite an old school friend, Philip Oakey, to join the band. Oakey {{was working as a}} hospital porter at the time and was known on the Sheffield social scene for his eclectic style of dress. Although he had no musical experience, Ware thought he would be ideal as lead singer for The Future as [...] "he already looked like a pop star." [...] When Ware called on Oakey he found he was out, so asked him to join the Future by leaving a note stuck to <b>his</b> <b>front</b> <b>door.</b> He accepted the invitation, but early sessions were awkward. Oakey had never sung {{in front of an audience}} before, could not play keyboards and only owned a saxophone (which he could barely play). Listening to one of Ware and Marsh's demos, Oakey was inspired to write some lyrics which later became the single [...] "Being Boiled".|$|E

50|$|On July 2, 1917, East St. Louis was {{engulfed by}} a bloody race riot, {{characterized}} by violent attacks by white mobs on blacks to whom little protection {{was provided by}} law enforcement.

Although Noah Parden encouraged his client and one-time political rival Leroy Bundy {{to leave the city}} during the tense days before the riot, he himself remained at his home in East St. Louis, later testifying that on the night of July 1 he had responded to the arrival of a carload of white men cruising past his house in a Model T Ford and shooting from the car, by running to <b>his</b> own <b>front</b> <b>door</b> with a gun.|$|R

Some 2,500 houses were reported as seriously damaged or destroyed and 54 people were killed, many because of fallen electrical wires. Several people were found dead in downtown Providence, near the central police station; they may have been seeking shelter. Ten-year-old Peter Gosselin, of Uxbridge, Massachusetts, disappeared in the deep snow just feet from <b>his</b> home's <b>front</b> <b>door</b> and was not found until three weeks later.
