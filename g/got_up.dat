It was horrifying and fascinating at the same time.|$|E

In result of an injury, Finlay was stretchered out of the ring, and Mysterio followed. Finlay, however, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and attacked Mysterio, ending the match in a no contest.|$|E
5|$|My dearest mother, This morning, {{about four}} o'clock, I was <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> just one hour after I retired, with the {{information}} that at six {{we were going to}} Richmond. At six we started. The rebs had gone at three, along a road strewn with all the munitions of war. Richmond was reached, but the barbarous South had consigned it to flames. The roar of the bursting shells was terrific.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{injuries}} {{also made}} him permanently unable {{to sit for}} long periods without pain, so when he attended conferences as a politician, he would briefly rise from his seat from time to time. During his talks with British Prime Minister Harold Wilson aboard HMS Tiger in 1966, Smith regularly <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and looked out of a porthole; the British incorrectly interpreted this as Smith feeling intimidated by Wilson, or seasick.|$|E

5|$|The fifth {{match was}} a Triple Threat {{match for the}} WWE Championship between {{champion}} John Cena, Christian, and Chris Jericho. The match saw all three wrestlers take the advantage over one another. A spot in the match included Jericho applying the Walls of Jericho on Cena, but he released the move and performed a springboard dropkick on Christian, after Christian <b>got</b> <b>up</b> on the ring apron. Late in the match, Jericho reversed an Unprettier attempt by Christian by tossing Christian directly to Cena. Cena performed an FU on Christian and pinned Christian to retain the WWE title.|$|E
5|$|When the {{two sides}} met in late-February, {{a week before the}} brawl game, during the third period, Flyers winger Mark Recchi was {{following}} Martin Havlat of the Senators when he crossed into the Philadelphia defensive zone. As this happened, Recchi hooked Havlat, causing both of the players to collide and fall into the boards. When Havlat <b>got</b> <b>up</b> from the ice, angered by Recchi's hook, he took his stick above him and slashed Recchi, hitting him in the face.|$|E
5|$|With {{approximately}} {{two minutes of}} normal time left, the referee's whistle blew for an infringement.

5|$|Albert and Victoria {{chose the}} names Louisa Caroline Alberta. She was baptized on 13 May 1848 in Buckingham Palace's private chapel by John Bird Sumner, the Archbishop of Canterbury. Though she was christened Louisa at the service, she was {{invariably}} known as Louise throughout her life. Her godparents were Duke Gustav of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (her paternal great-great-uncle, for whom Prince Albert stood proxy); the Duchess of Saxe-Meiningen (for whom her great-aunt Queen Adelaide stood proxy); and the Hereditary Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz (her first cousin once-removed, {{for whom the}} Duchess of Cambridge stood proxy). During the ceremony, the Duchess of Gloucester, {{one of the few}} children of King George III who was still alive, forgot where she was, and suddenly <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{in the middle of the}} service and knelt at the Queen's feet, much to the Queen's horror.|$|E
5|$|As Jim Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism {{came to a head}} in a game against the Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as he <b>got</b> <b>up</b> to throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} leg of the flight, at about 15:00, Keč, wearing a winter coat, <b>got</b> <b>up</b> from his seat and walked {{to the front of the}} aircraft. A flight {{attendant}} stopped him. After talking for a short while, and another flight attendant came by, he was let into the cockpit. No information about the hijacking was given to the passengers until arrival at Bodø. Bodø Airport was evacuated and the aircraft parked at Bodø Main Air Station, the military section. After landing, by order of the hijacker, the passengers were informed that all women, children under 18 and people over 60 were to leave the aircraft. After this had happened, there were 77 passengers and four crew members left. The aircraft departed Bodø at about 16:00 and headed for Oslo Airport, Gardermoen, which was closed for all other traffic.|$|E

5|$|During the quarter-finals, Canada {{faced the}} United States with McLeod {{starting}} in goal. In the twelfth {{minute of the}} game, American player Heather O'Reilly made a shot on goal, but it was stopped by McLeod. Angela Hucles then got the rebound and scored for the United States. However, McLeod injured her right knee during the play. She was down for several minutes before she <b>got</b> <b>up</b> and attempted to resume playing. A few minutes later, she was replaced by goalkeeper Karina LeBlanc in the 19th minute. The United States won the game 1–2. It was later revealed that McLeod had torn her right ACL.|$|E
5|$|Lex Luger was {{accompanied}} {{to the ring}} by four women with revealing outfits {{as he prepared to}} face Mr. Perfect. The match began with technical wrestling, and Perfect tried to injure Luger's knee while Luger worked on Perfect's back. Perfect took control of the match with a powerslam and tried to pin Luger after performing a dropkick from the top rope. Luger's foot was on the ropes, however, so the referee halted the three-count and continued the match. Luger gained momentum and pinned Perfect; Perfect's feet were on the rope, but the referee did not see them. Luger continued to attack Perfect after the match and hit him with his forearm, which contains a steel plate {{as the result of a}} legitimate motorcycle accident. When Perfect <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> he chased Luger but was attacked by Shawn Michaels backstage.|$|E
5|$|On 10 April, Rane <b>got</b> <b>up</b> {{early and}} resumed {{work on an}} {{obstacle}} {{that had not been}} cleared the previous night. Within a span of two hours, he cleared the roadblock of five large pine trees in the midst of mines and machine-gun fire. This allowed the 4th Dogra Battalion to advance another thirteen kilometers until it encountered another major roadblock. The Pakistani forces were situated on the adjoining hills and able to fire on all approaches to the block, making its destruction problematic. Rane drove a tank to the roadblock and took cover behind the tank while blasting open the roadblock with mines, opening the road {{before the end of the}} night.|$|E

5|$|On May 20, 2006, Barrett was {{involved}} in an infamous altercation with A. J. Pierzynski during the Chicago Crosstown Classic between the Chicago White Sox and Cubs. During the game's second inning, Brian Anderson hit a sacrifice fly, which allowed Pierzynski to score the game's first run. Pierzynski collided with Barrett en route to home plate, causing Barrett to fall down. Pierzynski showed his enthusiasm by slapping home plate. As Pierzynski <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> he bumped into Barrett, who proceeded to punch him. Scott Podsednik came to Pierzynski's aid and subdued Barrett. Anderson and John Mabry eventually joined the brawl before both teams emptied their dugouts and stormed the field.|$|E
5|$|Recording {{started in}} December 1971 at Morgan Studios, London. Unlike {{previous}} albums, where Anderson had generally written songs in advance, only the initial {{section of the}} album had been worked out when the band went into the studio. The remainder of the suite was written during the recording sessions. To compensate {{for a lack of}} material, Anderson <b>got</b> <b>up</b> early each morning to prepare music {{for the rest of the}} band to learn during that day's session. The lyrics were written first, with the music constructed to fit around them. Anderson recalls the album took about two weeks to record and another two or three for overdubs and mixing. The final work spanned the entire length of an LP record, split over two sides.|$|E
5|$|Two months later, on August 5, 2000, at the Mohegan Sun in Connecticut, Judah {{defeated}} former IBF Light Welterweight Champion Terron Millett by fourth-round knockout. Judah {{was knocked}} {{down in the}} first round from a left hand. Judah rose quickly, and from that point on he dominated the fight. Judah hurt Millett with two combinations {{near the end of the}} first round. In round two, Judah sent Millett down with a right hand to the chin. Millett survived the round, but he was clearly hurt. In round four, Judah charged across the ring and inflicted a series of blows on Millett, knocking him down again. Millett <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> but Judah continued his assault and knocked Millett down again. Millett rose at the count of four, but his legs were unsteady and the referee decided to stop the bout.|$|E
