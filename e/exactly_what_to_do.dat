500|$|We {{achieved}} {{what we did}} on a low budget {{because we}} carefully planned the whole production in advance of starting the cameras. [...] Thus, when we moved into the studio for fifteen days of scheduled shooting, we didn't have to start making decisions. Because of our pre-production conferences with director of photography Floyd Crosby and art director Daniel Haller, everyone knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> barring any last minute inspirations on the set.|$|E
500|$|The band {{cancelled}} its scheduled recording sessions as {{a result}} of Berry's departure. [...] "Without Bill it was different, confusing", Mills later said. [...] "We didn't know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> We couldn't rehearse without a drummer." [...] The remaining members of R.E.M. resumed work on the album in February 1998 at Toast Studios in San Francisco. The band ended its decade-long collaboration with Scott Litt and hired Pat McCarthy to produce the record. Nigel Godrich was taken on as assistant producer, and drafted in Screaming Trees member Barrett Martin and Beck's touring drummer Joey Waronker. The recording process was plagued with tension, and the group came close to disbanding. Bertis Downs called an emergency meeting where the band members sorted out their problems and agreed to continue as a group. Led off by the single [...] "Daysleeper", Up (1998) debuted in the top ten in the US and UK. However, the album was a relative failure, selling 900,000 copies in the US by mid-1999 and eventually selling just over two million copies worldwide. While R.E.M.'s American sales were declining, the group's commercial base was shifting to the UK, where more R.E.M. records were sold per capita than any other country and the band's singles regularly entered the Top 20.|$|E
500|$|Pitchfork writer Stuart Berman {{stated that}} [...] "The Hungry Saws {{temperate}} approach {{feels like the}} work of a band who are grateful for a new lease on life, but not sure <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with it," [...] noting how [...] "the record turns increasingly more restrained, as it reconciles the band's well-established soul affinities with a more pastoral presentation" [...] while praising its [...] "beautifully rendered" [...] ballads. In his review for PopMatters, Michael Keefe opined that while [...] "all of The Hungry Saw finds Tindersticks trekking through fairly familiar territory...they find new diversions along the way." [...] Writing for Record Collector, Jake Kennedy said that [...] "The Hungry Saw marks a wonderful coming of age for Tindersticks...this is the sound of pure rejuvenation." [...] In a less complementary review, Shannon Zimmerman of Spin found that [...] "the first half of Tindersticks' latest is a can't-miss proposition" [...] but that [...] "the disc's second half descends into a morass of half-finished, melancholic curios that mostly go nowhere slowly." [...] Uncut critic Sam Richards was similarly unimpressed, offering that [...] "Tindersticks have returned refreshed, but some of the old dissolute glamour is gone." [...] This opinion was not shared by Tiny Mix Tapes, whose reviewing writer said that [...] "ultimately, it’s another Tindersticks record, and they’re still good after all these years. It’s not an incredibly remarkable record, but when a band is this consistent for this long, it’s hard to fault it." ...|$|E

500|$|Now {{two years}} since she signed the deal, Lavigne, who was then unknown, came to the {{attention}} of the three-piece production team The Matrix. Arista could not find the right direction for Lavigne, so the team's manager, Sandy Roberton, suggested that they work together: [...] "Why don't you put her together with The Matrix for a couple of days?" [...] According to member Lauren Christy, they had been listening to Lavigne's early songs and felt they contained [...] "a Faith Hill kind of vibe". As soon as they saw Lavigne coming into their studio, The Matrix felt that her musical direction was incongruous to her image and attitude. After talking to Lavigne for an hour, [...] "we cottoned on that she wasn't happy but couldn't quite figure out where to go". The Matrix played her songs with Faith Hill influences, because it was those kind of songs the label wanted Lavigne to sing. But Lavigne dismissed it, saying she wanted songs with punk rock inclinations. Lavigne played The Matrix a song that she had recorded and really loved, a track with sounds in the likes of the rock band System of a Down. Fortunately, prior to forming The Matrix, its members' early projects were in the pop-rock type, so they readily figured out what Lavigne wanted to record and knew <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with her. They told her to come back the following day, and in the afternoon during that day, they wrote a song that evolved into [...] "Complicated" [...] and another song called [...] "Falling Down" [...] (Falling Down appears on the Sweet Home Alabama Soundtrack). They played it to Lavigne when she came back the following day, inspiring her what path she should take.|$|E

In 1967 the US offered a newer version of the Polaris, the A3T design, which featured a [...] "hardened" [...] missile airframe intended to better protect it against ABMs. As the UK had not yet received their missiles, they agreed to use the A3T version as it required relatively few other changes.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout her career, Vélez's onscreen {{persona of}} a hot tempered, lusty [...] "wild" [...] woman was closely tied to her off screen personality. The press often {{referred}} to her by such names as [...] "The Mexican Spitfire", [...] "The Mexican It girl" [...] and [...] "The Mexican Kitten". Vélez consciously chose to promote her [...] "Whoopee Lupe" [...] persona but dismissed {{the idea that she}} was wild. In an interview she said: [...] "What I attribute my success?, I think, simply, because I'm different. I'm not beautiful, but I have beautiful eyes and know <b>exactly</b> <b>what</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with them. Although the public thinks that I'm a very wild girl. Actually I'm not. I'm just me, Lupe Vélez, simple and natural Lupe. If I'm happy, I dance and sing and acted like a child. And if something irritates me, I cry and sob. Someone called that 'personality.' The Personality is nothing more than behave with others as you really are. If I tried to look and act like Norma Talmadge, the great dramatic actress, or like Corinne Griffith, the aristocrat of the movies, or like Mary Pickford, the sweet and gentle Mary, I would be nothing more than an imitation. I just want to be myself: Lupe Velez." ...|$|E
