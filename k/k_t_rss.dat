The peptide maps of the 100 K and 17 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigens were also compared with those of the SV 40 -specific proteins found in cells infected by the nondefective adenovirus type 2 -SV 40 hybrid viruses, which we have previously shown are encoded by defined sequences within the early region of SV 40 (<b>K.</b> Mann, <b>T.</b> Hunter, G.

Data for both the velocity and passive scalar fields are considered, the latter for several values of the Schmidt number Sc.

The evolution of these four quantities provides qualified support for the equilibrium similarity proposal of George (1992 a, b). In particular, this proposal provides a reliable means of calculating the transfer functions, starting with known distributions of E(k, <b>t)</b> and Eè (<b>k,</b> <b>t).</b> However, at sufficiently large values of the wavenumber k, normalizations by Kolmogorov and Batchelor variables yield a better collapse of these quantities than the use of equilibrium similarity The distributions of Eè (<b>k,</b> <b>t)</b> and Tè (<b>k,</b> <b>t)</b> do not depend on Sc, when the latter is in the range 0. 7 Sc 7, irrespective of the normalization adopted. The velocity derivative skewness and mixed velocity–scalar derivative skewness approach constant values as t increases.

40|$|The {{adenovirus}} E 1 A transforming region, which encodes immortalization, partial cell transformation, {{and gene}} activation functions, expresses two early mRNAs, 13 S and 12 S. Multiple-T antigen species with different electrophoretic mobilities are formed from each mRNA, presumably by unknown posttranslational modifications. The adenovirus type 12 (Ad 12) 13 S and 12 S mRNAs encode E 1 A T antigens of 266 and 235 amino acid residues (266 R and 235 R), respectively. To study possible posttranslational processing at the N and C termini and {{to distinguish between}} the Ad 12 266 R and 235 R T antigens, we prepared antibodies targeted to synthetic peptides encoded at the common C (peptide 204) and N (peptide 202) termini of the 266 R and 235 R T antigens and at the unique internal domain of the 266 R T antigen (peptide 206). The specificity of each anti-peptide antibody was confirmed by immunoprecipitation of the 266 R and 235 R T antigens produced in Escherichia coli. Immunoprecipitation analysis of the E 1 A T antigens synthesized in Ad 12 -infected KB cells revealed the following. Antibody to the common C terminus recognized three T antigens with apparent Mrs of 43, 000, 42, 000, and 39, 000 (43 K, 42 K, and 39 K). All three forms were phosphorylated and were present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. The 43 K and 42 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigens were rapidly synthesized during a 10 -min pulse with [35 S]methionine in Ad 12 -infected cells. The 43 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen had a half-life of 20 min, the 42 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen had a longer half-life of about 40 min, and the 39 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen became the predominant E 1 A T antigen. Antibodies to the unique region immunoprecipitated the 43 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen but not the 42 K and 39 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigens. Antibody to the N terminus immunoprecipitated the 43 K and 42 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigens but not the 39 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen, suggesting that the 39 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen possessed a modified N terminus. Partial N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis showed that the 43 K and 42 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigens contain methionine at residues 1 and 5, as predicted from the DNA sequence, whereas no methionine was released from the 39 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen during the first six cycles of Edman degradation.

Interaction of mouse 3 T 3 fibroblasts with simian virus 40 (SV 40) thus generates four classes of transformed cells. We have examined viral gene expression in these four classes of cell lines. Immunoprecipitation of [35 S]methionine-labeled cell extracts with an antiserum obtained from tumor-bearing hamsters detected the SV 40 large T and small t proteins (94, 000 molecular weight [94 K], 17 K) and the nonviral host 54 K protein in all cell lines tested. A tumor antigen with an apparent molecular weight of 100, 000 was also found in some, but not all, lines. Similar "super T" molecules have been found by others in many rodent transformed lines. We carried out {{an analysis of the}} relation of phenotype to relative amounts of these proteins in cell lines of the four classes, using the Spearman rank correlation test. The amount of the 100 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen relative to the 94 <b>K</b> <b>T</b> antigen or to total viral protein was well correlated with the ability to form colonies in semisolid medium.
