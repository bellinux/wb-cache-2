HUGE, the Hydrogen Oriented Underground Coal Gasification for Europe project, co-financed by the European Coal and Steel Research Fund is a major clean coal technology R&D project in the European Union. HUGE raises high expectations because of the potential of its specific UCG concept to integrate large scale <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> production of hydrogen-rich gases with on site geological storage of carbon dioxide. This would allow transferring underground generated low carbon and partly purified hydrogen or synthesis gases to the surface as major product, while leaving behind the wastes generated during their conversion from coal. The project, which primarily addresses a European issue, also has a global dimension because of the environmental constraints related to the technologies involved. Major attention in the technology oriented project HUGE is paid to optimizing the integration of mature elements of {{coal gasification}} and hydro-gasification processes with heat and mass transfer phenomena taking place in geological multiphase systems of complex geometry.

40|$|<b>In</b> <b>situ</b> <b>gasification</b> {{of crude}} oil using {{downhole}} gasification (DHG) is a new, improved oil recovery technique for application in light oil reservoirs. Inert gas is generated inside a DHG unit by gasifying part of the produced oil. A string of DHG units is positioned along a horizontal producer well, or on a vertical well. The gases, mainly hydrogen and CO 2, are then directed into a gas cap formation. Incremental oil recovery is achieved via gravity stabilized gas injection or another suitable gas displacement drive method. There is essentially no net heat release into the reservoir if efficient heat recovery is practiced. A series of high pressure, continuous flow expts. was performed in a small-scale gasifier unit, using n-pentane as feedstock, to represent the light naphtha fraction from a crude oil. The expts. were operated at pressures up to 100 bar, compared to the 20 to 30 bar normally used in a surface steam reforming plant. Catalytic steam reforming of the pseudo-light naphtha fraction, contg. reservoir gas, achieved conversions of 70 to 80 % at a gasifier exit temp. of 720 Deg C. The produced gas contained up to 50 % hydrogen, with the remainder comprising carbon oxides. The new IOR technique has wide potential application in depleted light oil reservoirs where the pressure is less than about 200 bar, {{although it may be}} possible to increase this limit. The economics of the DHG process appear to be attractive, if energy is recovered from the hot gas stream. The produced gases are stored-up in the reservoir and any emissions are therefore limited to those which are released from the crude oil when it is produced. If the reservoir pressure is low, then the amt. of gas produced with the oil will be relatively small. The hydrogen product stored-up in the reservoir is a valuable resource, which could be recovered later for use in the future "hydrogen economy. ". [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E

However, the concentrated production of low quality CB at these feeding operations serves as a good feedstock for <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>gasification</b> for syngas (CO and H 2) production and subsequent use in power generation. A small scale (10 kW) countercurrent fixed bed gasifier was rebuilt to perform gasification studies under quasisteady state conditions using dairy biomass (DB) as feedstock and various air-steam mixtures as oxidizing sources. A DB-ash (from DB) blend and a DB-Wyoming coal blend were also studied for comparison purposes. In addition, chlorinated char was also produced via pure pyrolysis of DB using N 2 and N 2 -steam gas mixtures. The chlorinated char is useful for enhanced capture of Hg in ESP of coal fired boilers. Two main parameters were investigated in the gasification studies with air-steam mixtures. One was the equivalence ratio ER (the ratio of stochiometric air to actual air) and the second was the steam to fuel ratio (S:F). Prior to the experimental studies, atom conservation with i) limited product species and ii) equilibrium modeling studies with a large number of product species were performed on the gasification of DB to determine suitable range of operating conditions (ER and S:F ratio). Results on bed temperature profile, gas composition (CO, CO 2, H 2, CH 4, C 2 H 6, and N 2), gross heating value (HHV), and energy conversion efficiency (ECE) are presented. Both modeling and experimental results show that gasification under increased ER and S:F ratios tend to produce rich mixtures in H 2 and CO 2 but poor in CO. Increased ER produces gases with higher HHV but decreases the ECE due to higher tar and char production.

In this study, using the high-temperature triaxial permeability test equipment for different ranges of temperature and pore pressure, the permeability and mechanical characteristics of lignite from the Pingzhuang Mine Area in Chifeng have been examined. The results show that, at constant confining pressure, the elastic modulus of lignite decreases with increasing temperature.

40|$|This PhD thesis {{presents}} the work {{carried out by}} kinetic modeling incorporated with particle simulation on selected plant based biomass during pyrolysis and gasification followed by an experimental investigation of those processes under entrained flow to satisfy the engineering requirement. Renewable energy sources are becoming {{a significant part of}} the primary energy share for mitigating the CO₂ emission along with addressing the issue of fossil fuel depletion. According to the lifecycle of biomass, it is CO₂ neutral and can be a potential replacement for fossil fuels. Being a solid fuel, it can be consumed using the existing technology for solid fossil fuels, however, with modification. To modify any available technology, significant research effort is needed in both fundamental and engineering level to find out optimum reaction conditions. One appropriate technology for solid fuel conversion is entrained flow gasification which uses a high heating rate and low residence time to produce high energy gas. Non-conventional biomass (e. g. algae) along with woody biomass might be consumed by this technology. At the same time, fossil fuel (coal) can be potentially replaced by blending biomass with it. To model the inherent kinetics involved in the pyrolysis process, a new algorithm was proposed for higher order distributed activation energy model. The new algorithm was found to be versatile in estimating the intrinsic pyrolysis kinetics for different types of biomass (algae, sawdust, and coconut shell) along with predicting the pyrolysis behavior of the blends of one those biomass samples and coal. To link this fundamental development to the engineering application, entrained flow pyrolysis experiments on biomass were performed on biomass by varying different operating conditions. After that, a particle model was developed for this process to predict the conversion profile of the solid biomass particle using apparent kinetics which showed good agreement with the experimental data. A guideline was also generated on the basis of parametric study (particle size, temperature, gas velocity, residence time etc.) to design a laminar entrained flow reactor for pyrolysis. Further development of the particle model was achieved by incorporating the intrinsic kinetic parameters obtained by the newly developed algorithm. It was proposed that inclusion of pyrolysis heat of reaction would improve the prediction of the model if intrinsic kinetic parameters were to be used. At the same time, effect of operating parameters (temperature, particle size) and species variation on entrained flow pyrolysis was evaluated. The study was limited to the particle size ranges under 600 µm (suitable particle size for entrained flow gasification) and up to a temperature of 1000 °C. Among all the parameters, particle size was found to be the most critical because of its influence on both residence time and heating rate. Also, temperature was found be very important for achieving full conversion in case of larger particle size. At 1000 °C, pyrolysis of all types of biomass under consideration reached completion. In case of a lower temperature (800 °C), some unconverted particles were observed for larger size (500 - 600 µm). Tar production was minimized at 1000 °C for the smaller particle size (150 - 250 µm). At a higher temperature, the gas yield was also increased considerably due to the increase in conversion efficiency. Morphological study on the char particles showed that sawdust experienced a molten phase during its pyrolysis and due to the gas release from inside, the smaller particles were converted into cenospheres where no morphology of the parent particle was visible. This resulted in highly reactive char with an extremely porous structure. However, this observation could not be generalized as algae and coconut shell char showed different morphological development. As the char obtained from the entrained flow pyrolysis process were different from fixed bed chars, they were studied for their reactivity and kinetics under CO₂. Generally, gasification kinetics of most of the chars was predicted well by random pore model. Only the algal char obtained from rapid pyrolysis was different because of its low amount of gasifiable mass attached to the surface which did not show any porous structure, therefore, followed the volumetric reaction model. Along with the fixed bed chars, only coconut shell char from entrained flow reactor showed very low reactivity. This difference in the reactivity was attributed to the lack of mesopores along with the variation of indigenous alkali in the ash among the biomass species to a lesser extent. This low reactivity of coconut shell char resulted in the entrained flow gasification experiments which were performed by varying the temperature, particle size and also concentration of gasifying agent (CO₂). The char from coconut shell did not show any significant increase in conversion due to the decrease in particle size whereas a steady linear increase was observed for temperature. In contrast, the sawdust char was highly reactive and reached its highest conversion (50 %) at 1000 °C under 20 % CO₂ for a reactor length of 1. 885 m. Remarkable increase in the conversion was observed with decrease in the particle size and increase of temperature. The increase in reactor length also showed positive effect on char conversion and gas production. These findings have important implications on the gasifier design and sample preparation meaning there will be no benefit of reduced particle size on conversion if the sample itself is less reactive in the first place. Also it was revealed that if raw biomass was gasified, these effects would have been indistinguishable because of the dominance of pyrolysis. No tar was observed during char gasification process at 1000 °C as most of it removed during the pyrolysis process. Along with the above studies, a new analytical technique (Synchrotron based Infrared spectrum) was used to study the pyrolysis process of biomass. The study delineated the evolution of functional groups from the surface of biomass along with the effect of heating rate during the process. This was a preliminary study which opened up new possibilities in energy research considering <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>gasification</b> of biomass...|$|E
40|$|This {{focus of}} this report are the UK coal {{resources}} available for exploitation by the new technologies of Underground Coal Gasification, Coalbed Methane production and Carbon Dioxide Sequestration. It also briefly considers the potential for further underground and opencast mining and the extraction of methane from working and closed mines. The potential for mining was mainly considered {{because it has a}} bearing on the scope for the new exploitation technologies rather than to identify resources or potential mine development areas. The report covers the UK landward area and nearshore areas, although information on the extent of underground mining was not available for the nearshore areas. This work was carried out by the British Geological Survey, with the assistance of Wardell Armstrong and Imperial College, London. It represents a summary {{of the results of the}} Study of the UK Coal Resource for New Exploitation Technologies Project, carried out for the DTI Cleaner Coal Technology Programme (Contract No. C/ 01 / 00301 / 00 / 00) under the management of Future Energy Solutions (Agreement No. C/ 01 / 00301 / 00 / 00). Coalbed methane production can be subdivided into three categories: Methane drained from working mines, known as Coal Mine Methane (CMM), has been exploited in the UK since at least the 1950 s. Currently all working mines except Daw Mill and Ellington drain methane. It is used to generate electricity at Harworth, Tower and Thoresby collieries and in boilers at Welbeck, Kellingley and Ricall/Whitemoor collieries. There is potential to increase the exploitation of CMM in the UK but this is mainly a question of economics. There is also an environmental case for further utilisation, as methane is an important greenhouse gas, 23 times more powerful than carbon dioxide on a mass basis. Methane drained from abandoned mines, known as Abandoned Mine Methane (AMM), is a methane-rich gas that is obtained from abandoned mines by applying suction to the workings. The fuel gas component consists primarily of methane desorbed from seams surrounding the mined seam(s). These unmined seams have been de-stressed and fractured by the collapse of overlying and underlying strata into the void left by the extracted seam(s). Currently AMM is being exploited at sites in North Staffordshire (Silverdale Colliery), the East Midlands (Bentinck, Shirebrook and Markham collieries) and Yorkshire (Hickleton, Monk Bretton and Wheldale collieries). The methane-rich gas is used for electricity generation or supplied to local industry for use in boilers and kilns. Over the last few years, the fledgling UK AMM industry has started to ascend a learning curve. However, it has suffered a major setback since the wholesale price of electricity fell under the New Electricity Trading Arrangements and AMM does not currently qualify as renewable energy in the UK. Coalbed methane produced via boreholes from virgin coal seams, known as Virgin Coalbed Methane (VCBM), has been the subject of significant exploration effort in Lancashire, North Wales, South Wales and Scotland. The best production of gas and water from a single well is understood to be from the project at Airth, north of Falkirk in Scotland. However, this is not economic at present. The main reason for the slow development of VCBM in the UK is perceived to be the widespread low permeability of UK coal seams, although little work has been carried out in the UK on coal permeability, or to truly identify the reasons for the lack of success. This must be overcome before the otherwise significant resource bases in the Clackmannan Syncline, Canonbie, Cumbria, South Lancashire, North Wales, North Staffordshire and South Wales coalfields can be exploited. A technological breakthrough is required to overcome the likely widespread low permeability in the UK Carboniferous coal seams. Otherwise, at best, production will probably be limited to niche opportunities in areas where high seam permeability exists. The criteria used to define and map the location of VCBM resources are as follows: • Coal seams greater than 0. 4 m in thickness at depths > 200 m • Seam gas content > 1 m 3 /tonne • 500 metres or more horizontal separation from underground coal workings • Vertical separation of 150 m above and 40 m below a previously worked seam Vertical separation of > 100 m from major unconformities of these areas is thought to be about, 900 x 109 m 3 (about 29 years of UK natural gas consumption). he main criteria sed for the delineation and mapping of resource areas with potential for UCG were: eparation from underground coal workings and current omic and environmental grounds as described later in this report. he establishment of these criteria do not rule out UCG projects in shallower or thinner seams, if • Vertical separation of > 100 m from major aquifers, and • Areas with a CMM resource (current underground coal mining licences) were excluded. Note that the presence of a CBM resource does not imply permeability in the coal seams or that the resource can be recovered economically now or at any time in the future. Using these criteria resource areas were defined and represented on the maps. The total VCBM resource 2 Underground coal gasification (UCG) is the process whereby the injection of oxygen and steam/water via a borehole results in the partial in-situ combustion of coal to produce a combustible gas mixture consisting of CO 2, CH 4, H 2 and CO, the proportions depending on temperature, pressure conditions and the reactant gases injected. This product gas is then extracted via a producing well for use as an energy source. All previous trials of this technology in the UK took place in the 1950 ’s or before, e. g. Durham (1912), Newman Spinney (1949 - 1956) and Bayton (c. 1955), although this country is well placed for UCG, with large reserves of indigenous coal both onshore and offshore. T u • Seams of 2 m thickness or greater • Seams at depths between 600 and 1200 m from the surface • 500 m or more horizontal and vertical scoal mining licences, and • Greater than 100 m from major aquifers While seams outside these depth and thicknesses criteria are known to support UCG, the criteria were chosen for this generic study on econ T local site specific factors support it. Mapping of the potential UCG resource has identified large areas suitable for UCG, particularly in Eastern England, Midland Valley of Scotland, North Wales, Cheshire Basin, South Lancashire, Canonbie, the Midlands and Warwickshire. Potential also exists in other coalfields but on a smaller scale; this is often limited by the extent of former underground coal mining activities. The total area where coals are suitable for gasification is approximately 2. 8 x 109 m 2. Where the criteria for UCG are met, the minimum volume of coal available for gasification, calculated assuming only one 2 m thick seam meets the criteria across each area, is app 63 roximately 5, 698 x 10 m (7 Btonnes). Using an verage of the total thickness of coals that meet the criteria across each area gives a more realistic source figure of 12, 911 x 106 m 3 (17 Btonnes). pass the expensive step of parating the CO 2 from flue gases. If the main objective, however, is CO 2 sequestration rather than ethane production then separation of the flue gases may be worthwhile. O 2 on coal seams, is would render them unminable and ungasifiable (because the CO 2 would be released). Any future ining of such coals would require re-capture and sequestration of the stored CO. ion, providing that other issues, such as low seam permeability, can be vercome. Large areas where coal is below 1, 200 m occur in the UK, particularly in the Cheshire asin and Eastern England. In summary • and its potential application in the UK cannot be assessed. However, there are vast areas of coal at depths below 1, 200 m that are possibly too deep for mining and <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>gasification...</b>|$|E
