25|$|The {{notion of}} Svatantrya {{is central to}} Somananda's philosophy. The free-will of Shiva is {{manifested}} as energy, called Shakti, which emanates from Shiva himself and is the stuff from which the world is created, thus, being ontologically anterior to the world, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> any obstacles. When Shakti begins the process of manifestation it subdivides {{into a number of}} ontological categories or substances called tattvas, 36 in number. Thus, the world is considered real (not illusory, as in other monistic idealistic spiritual schools).|$|E
25|$|Each State has a Bar Council {{of its own}} whose {{function}} is to enroll the Barristers willing to practise predominately within the territorial confines of that State and to perform {{the functions of the}} Bar Council of India within the territory assigned to them. Therefore, each law degree holder must be enrolled with a (single) State Bar Council to practise in India. However, enrollment with any State Bar Council does not restrict the Barrister from appearing before any court in India, even though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> the territorial jurisdiction of the State Bar Council which he is enrolled in.|$|E

Roark says that if Keating promises to build it exactly as designed, Roark will do it while permitting Keating {{to take all the}} credit. With prodding from the envious Toohey, the firm backing the housing project decides to alter the design presented by Keating. Roark decides, with Francon's secret help, to rig explosives to the buildings and destroy them. Roark is arrested at the site after the demolition. In order to demonstrate Roark's guilt, Toohey pressures Keating into privately confessing that Roark designed the project.|$|E

25|$|In epistemology, for example, the {{criticism}} of what Fodor calls the interpretationalist hypothesis accounts for the common-sense intuition (on which naïve physics is based) of the independence of reality from the conceptual categories of the experimenter. If the processes of elaboration of the mental modules are in fact independent of the background theories, then {{it is possible to}} maintain the realist view that two scientists who embrace two radically diverse theories see the world exactly in the same manner even if they interpret it differently. The point is {{that it is necessary to}} distinguish between observations and the perceptual fixation of beliefs. While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> doubt that the second process involves the holistic relationship between beliefs, the first is largely independent of the background beliefs of individuals.|$|E

500|$|King Mieszko II died in 1034; {{his son and}} heir, Casimir {{was forced}} to leave Poland. A period of anarchy followed, which lasted at least until 1039 when Casimir returned. According to Kristó and Makk, Béla was staying in Poland during this period; he even may have {{administered}} the kingdom in the name of his absent brother-in-law. On the other hand, the Polish historian, Manteuffel writes that Béla and his two brothers, in contrast with the unanimous report of the Hungarian chronicles, arrived in Poland only with Casimir, after 1039. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> a doubt that Levente and Andrew departed from Poland in about 1038, becauseaccording to the Illuminated Chroniclethey did not want to [...] "live the life of hangers-on in the Duke of Poland's court, regarded only as Béla's brothers".|$|E

[...] Manoah then {{prepared}} a sacrifice, but the Angel of the Lord would only {{allow it to be}} for God. He touched it with his staff, miraculously engulfing it in flames, and then ascended into the sky in the fire — and, in doing so, revealed that he was not simply an angel but was God in angelic form. This was such dramatic evidence {{of the nature of the}} Messenger that Manoah feared for his life, since it was said that no one could live after seeing God. However, his wife convinced him that, if God planned to slay them, he would never have revealed such things to them. In due time, their son Samson was born, and he was raised according to the provisions.|$|E
500|$|The {{creation}} of cardinal-nephews predates the hierarchical preeminence of cardinals within the Roman Catholic Church, which {{grew out of}} the 1059 decree of Pope Nicholas II, In nomine Domini, which established cardinal bishops as the sole electors of the Pope, with the consent of cardinal deacons and cardinal priests. The first known cardinal-nephew is Lottario (...) , seniore, cousin of Pope Benedict VIII (1012–1024), elected circa 1015. Benedict VIII also elevated his brother Giovanni (the future Pope John XIX) and his cousin Teofilatto (the future Pope Benedict IX) as cardinal-deacons. The first known cardinal-nephew after 1059 is Anselm of Lucca, the nephew or brother of Pope Alexander II (1061–1073), although until the end of 12th the majority of the alleged cases of such appointments are dubious, either because the relationship between the Pope and cardinal is not proven, or because the cardinalate of the papal kinsman is uncertain. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> doubt that the promotions of papal relatives to the College of Cardinals were common in 13th century.|$|E
500|$|Ward employs symbols {{such as a}} rose, {{which takes}} {{different}} meanings in different contexts: creative beauty for the Girl, an item for purchase for the Elderly Gentleman. [...] The same telephone system that provides the Elderly Gentleman with quick communication is an alienating, isolating symbol for the Boy, as <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> his means yet telephone poles are ever-present. [...] Ward displays discontinuous contrasts throughout the book: the Girl stretches herself out nude and carefree in a chapter of her section, while in his the Elderly Gentleman sadly views his worn-out naked form in a mirror. [...] While essentially wordless, via signs and placards the graphics incorporate far more text into the imagery than in earlier works. [...] To wordless novel scholar David Beronä, this shows an affinity {{to the development of}} the graphic novel, even if Vertigo itself is perhaps not comics; Ward himself was not permitted to read comics in his youth.|$|E

500|$|After a Getzein {{victory over}} the Kansas City Cowboys in 1886, the Detroit Free Press wrote: [...] "The Pretzel is all right. [...] He went into the box to-day and pitched one of his finest, his curves {{circling}} around {{in the form of}} the delicious pastry from which Getz takes his sobriquet." [...] However, the editor of the Grand Rapids World opined that Getzein's [...] "curved ball" [...] was a fiction. [...] He wrote:"The baseball enthusiasts claim for Getzein that he is able to so pitch a ball that it will describe the arc of a circle on a horizontal plane before reaching the catcher, and that therein lies the secret of his marvelous pitching [...] [...] [...] [...] Scientifically, this theory is utterly absurd. The forces that act upon a ball pitched by Getzein are not different from those which operate upon a projectile thrown from any other source, and the results must be the same, and governed by the same laws. The curves are in the imagination of Getzein's admirers. When the ball leaves his hand <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>beyond</b> his control, and it moves forward from the impulse last given it as it leaves his hand. It is then controlled by the force of propulsion, the resistance of the atmosphere, and gravitation[...] [...] [...] Getzein's antic and deceptive motions may deceive the batter, so that he is unable to discover the exact course of the ball in time to strike it, but he cannot throw a ball so as to make a curve on the horizontal plane." ...|$|E
