40|$|In this paper, {{the model}} of a two-degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) spring {{resonator}} with <b>end</b> <b>stopper</b> for an energy harvesting application is presented. Then we characterize its nonlinear dynamical behavior by numerical simulations when some suitable parameters are varied. The system is formed by two resonators subject to external vibrational excitation and with an <b>end</b> <b>stopper.</b> We present the continuous time dynamical model of the system {{in the form of}} a switched fourth order differential equation. Harmonic vibrations are considered as the main ambient energy source for the system and its frequency response representing the RMS value of the displacement is first computed. The dynamical behavior is unveiled by computing state-space trajectories, timedomain series and FFT spectra and frequency response as the excitation amplitude is varied.

40|$|We {{have applied}} a fluids density {{functional}} theory {{based on that}} of Yu and Wu [J. Chem. Phys. 116, 7094 (2002) ] to treat reversible supramolecular polymers near a hard surface. This approach combines a hard-sphere fluids density functional theory with the first-order thermodynamic perturbation theory of Wertheim. The supramolecular polymers are represented in the theory by hard-spheres with two associating sites. We explore {{the effects of the}} bonding scheme, monomer concentration, and association energy upon the equilibrium chain sizes and the depletion lengths. This study is performed on simple systems containing two-site monomers and binary mixtures of two-site monomers combined with <b>end</b> <b>stopper</b> monomers which have only a single association site. Our model has correct behavior in the dilute and overlap regimes and the bulk results can be easily connected to simpler random-flight models. We find that there is a nonmonotonic behavior of the depletion length of the polymers as a function of concentration and that this depletion length can be controlled through the concentration of end stoppers. These results are applicable to the study of colloidal dispersions in supramolecular polymer solutions. Process and EnergyMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
50|$|Monkey Knuckles is a skill toy {{consisting}} of two sliding wooden balls on a string, with <b>end</b> <b>stoppers</b> that allow the player to grip the toy. The toy can be manipulated {{in a variety of}} ways to perform tricks, and depending on the way that the player grasps and manipulates the toy, different styles of play are possible. Monkey Knuckles was developed by Matthew Hiebert, and was patented in 2006. In 2013 Hiebert licensed the design to Yomega Corp., which took over its manufacturing and distribution. In 2015, Kuma Films released a YouTube video featuring Monkey Knuckles.|$|R
40|$|In this work, a new [2]rotaxane {{consisted}} of a diazobenzene containing α-conjugated linear compartment, including the 4, 4 -bipyridyl moiety and α-cyclodextrin (-CD) as the macrocyclic compartment, was synthesised with yields of nearly 57 % and fully characterised. α-CD easily assembled with the linear compartment and suitable bulky <b>ends</b> (<b>stoppers)</b> in water to give a new [2]rotaxane. The characterisation of this supramolecular compound was accomplished using several spectroscopic techniques such as 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR and 2 D NMR spectroscopy, powder X-ray diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, induced circular dichroism and UV-vis spectrophotometry, as well as scanning electron microscopy and Energy Dispersive X-ray. Furthermore, the reversible E-Z photoisomerisation of both [2]rotaxane and its molecular dumbbell was investigated by irradiation with UV light. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

50|$|The fourth type of needle is {{a hybrid}} needle. It is a {{straight}} needle with {{a point on}} one end and a flexible strand on the other <b>end</b> with a <b>stopper,</b> such as a large lightweight bead, at the end. This type of needle allows a larger project to be worked at one time than a straight needle, while folding up quickly and more compactly for travel.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional lamzdeliai {{are made}} of either bark or wood. The bark pipe (zieves lamzdelis) {{is made in the}} springtime of a willow, aspen or pine sprout. The bark is beaten on all sides, and twisted off of the wood. The blowing end is closed off with a stopper made from the wood, with one side cut off. At the place where the <b>stopper</b> <b>ends,</b> a whistle hole is cut into the bark, and one end of the hole is bent {{slightly}} inwards. Three to six finger holes are cut in the pipe. Wooden pipes {{are made of}} ash or linden wood. The bark is removed, and the instrument is hollowed out by burning, drilling or carving. The blowing hole, whistle hole and finger holes are made {{in the same way as}} for the bark pipes. Lamzdeliai are usually tuned to a diatonic major scale. The timbre is soft and breathy, but when the instrument is blown too strongly, the sound becomes sharp and shrill.|$|R

Old age and hard sarvice, Neb, has made me veer cable to the better <b>end.</b> The <b>stopper</b> is working loose, and a few more surges will leave the hulk adrift. The case is different with you, who are in your prime,--and a prime chap be you, on a yard or at the wheel. My parting advice to you, Neb, is, to hold out as you've begun. I don't say you're without failin's, (what nigger is?) but you're a good fellow, and as sartain to be found in your place as the pumps. In the first place, you're a married man; and, though your wife is only a negress, she's your wife, and you must stick to her through thick and thin. Take your master as an example, and obsarve how he loves and cherishes your mistress," [...] [here Lucy pressed, gently, closer to my side;] [...] "and then, as to your children, bring 'em up according' to the advice of Madam Wallingford. You can never sail under better instructions than hern, as I know, by experience. Be particular to make that Hector of yours knock off from swearing: he's begun, and what's begun in sin is pretty sartain to have an indin'. Talk to him, first, and, if that won't do, rope's-end it out of him. There's great vartue in ratlin stuff, among boys. As for yourself, Neb, hold on as you have begun, and the Lord will have marcy on you, before the v'y'ge is up." ...|$|R
40|$|A {{system of}} {{identical}} disks {{is confined to}} a narrow channel, closed off at one <b>end</b> by a <b>stopper</b> and {{at the other end}} by a piston. All surfaces are hard and frictionless. A uniform gravitational field is directed parallel to the plane of the disks and perpendicular to the axis of the channel. We employ a method of configurational statistics that interprets jammed states as configurations of floating particles with structure. The particles interlink according to set rules. The two jammed microstates with smallest volume act as pseudo-vacuum. The placement of particles is subject to a generalized Pauli principle. Jammed macrostates are generated by random agitations and specified by two control variables. One {{is a measure of the}} intensity of random agitations at given pressure. The other is a measure of the change in gravitational potential energy in units of compression work when one particle is excited. In this two-dimensional space of variables there exists a critical point. The jammed macrostate realized at the critical point depends on the path of approach. We describe all jammed macrostates by volume and entropy. Both are functions of the average population densities of particles. Approaching the critical point in an extended space of control variables generates two types of jammed macrostates: states with random heterogeneities in mass density and states with domains of uniform mass density.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of sodium ion with blood proteins (2 - 7), other proteins (8 - 13) and with cellular content (14 - 19), is extensively {{dealt with in}} current litera ture. In {{the evaluation of the}} dialysis-perfusion system developed in this investi gation, 22 Na ion was used as a test substance. This dialysis perfusion system al lows the monitoring of unidirectional diffusion of a gamma emitting isotope from a dialysis cell. This cell is equipped with teflon <b>end</b> plugs and <b>stopper,</b> permitting the repeated use of the same celluose membrane for serial dialysis experiments. (1) METHOD Using thecontinuousmonitoredflowdialysischamber,the rateof escapeof 22 Na was determined in physiologicsodium chloridesolutionunder buffered (Phosphatebuffer) and non-bufferedconditions. The steadystatewas maintained where possible; it was compromised by the presence of serum electrolytes other than sodium within the dialysis cell. Studies of washed and unwashed serum protein indicated that this deviation did not significantly influence the studies. The rate of escape of 22 Na was determined under standard conditions and as in fluenced by temperature, pH, serum protein concentration and the presence of potassium ion. In addition, the Donnan effect and the relation of distance of diffusion to diffusion characteristics were studied. The serum protein was obtained from pooled specimens drawn from nor mal adult male laboratory workers. The pool was divided into aliquots for daily use and stored under frozen refrigeration. Each aliquot was thawed on the day of use. Freezing had no apparent effect upon sodium interaction...|$|R
