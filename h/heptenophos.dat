40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the {{protective}} effect of two individual oximes (HI- 6 and trimedoxime) with their combination in mice acutely poisoned with tabun, dichlorvos or <b>heptenophos.</b> Oxime HI- 6 did not protect experimental animals against either dichlorvos, <b>heptenophos</b> or tabun. Trimedoxime was very effective against all three OPs. The ED- 500 doses of trimedoxime necessary to protect 50 % of animals after the simultaneous administration of OPs and oxime were 42. 18, 14. 97 and 32. 08 μmol/kg in dichlorvos, <b>heptenophos</b> and tabun poisoning, respectively. Half-time of efficacy in the tabun protocol was approximately three and two times longer than in the protocol for <b>heptenophos</b> and dichlorvos, respectively indicating also that trimedoxime is very potent in counteracting tabun toxicity. Addition of trimedoxime significantly improved the protective effect of HI- 6 in acute tabun poisoning. When dichlorvos or <b>heptenophos</b> were used, addition of trimedoxime generally improved the antidotal effect of HI- 6, but still lower protection was obtained than in the case when trimedoxime alone was administered. The investigations of different oxime combinations have indicated that application of a mixture of two oximes represents a promising antidotal approach...|$|E
40|$|Introduction/Aim. In acute {{organophosphate}} poisoning {{the issue}} of special concern is the appearance of muscle fasciculations and convulsions that cannot be adequately antagonised {{by the use of}} atropine and oxime therapy. The aim {{of this study was to}} examine atidotal effect of obidoxime or HI- 6 combinations with memantine in mice poisoned with soman, dichlorvos or <b>heptenophos.</b> Methods. Male Albino mice were pretreated intravenously (iv) with increasing doses of oximes and/or memantine (10 mg/kg) at various times before poisoning with 1. 3 LD- 50 of soman, dichlorvos or <b>heptenophos,</b> in order to determine the median effective dose and the efficacy half-time. In a separate experiment, cerebral extravasation of Evans blue dye (40 mg/kg iv) was examined after application of memantine (10 mg/kg iv), midazolam (2. 5 mg/kg intraperitonealy - ip) and ketamine (20 mg/kg ip) 5 minutes before soman (1 LD- 50 subcutaneously - sc). Results. Coadministration of memantine induced a significant decrease in median effective dose in null time of both HI- 6 (7. 96 vs 1. 79 mmoL/kg in soman poisoning) and obidoxime (16. 80 vs 2. 75 mmoL/kg in dichlorvos poisoning; 21. 56 vs 6. 63 mmoL/kg in <b>heptenophos</b> poisoning). Memantine and midazolam succeded to counteract the soman-induced proconvulsive activity. Conclusion. Memantine potentiated the antidotal effect of HI- 6 against a lethal dose of soman, as well as the ability of obidoxime to antagonize the toxic effects of dichlorvos and <b>heptenophos</b> probably partly due to its anticonvulsive properties...|$|E
40|$|The {{toxicity}} towards Bombus terrestris (L.) of the insecticides acephate, buprofezin, carbaryl, cartap hydrochloride, chlorpyri-fos-methyl, cyfluthrin, cyromazine, dimethoate, <b>heptenophos,</b> imidacloprid, lamda-cyhalothrin, methomyl, phosalone, pirimicarb, quinalphos, rotenone, and teflubenzuron, of the acaricides fenazaquin, fenpyroximate, hexythiazox, propargite, and tebufenpyrad {{and of the}} insecticide-acaricides abamectin and amitraz {{was tested}} in the laboratory. Oral, topic contact, and indirect contact trials were carried out for each pesticide, employing formulated compounds dispersed in water at the highest field dose marked on the label. The pesticides that caused a mortality higher than the untreated controls were tested also at decreasing concentrations until the mortality was statistically insignificant in comparison {{with that of the}} control; also the acute oral and topic contact LD 50, the indirect contact LC 50 and the related hazard ratios were calculated for these pesticides.

40|$|International audienceAn {{evaluation}} of the stability of pesticides in fruits and vegetables during cryogenic sample processing (comminution of samples {{in the presence of}} dry ice) is reported. Pesticides were spiked onto the undamaged surface of individual units of fruit before freezing and comminution. The mean recoveries of pesticides spiked before and after comminution of the sample were compared to determine the relative stability of the individual pesticides during cryogenic sample processing. A stable internal deposition standard (IDS) was used to correct for physical losses and volumetric errors. Mean recovery results together with associated standard errors were obtained using Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) analysis. A total of 134 pesticides in 4 commodities (apples, grapes, lettuce and oranges) were evaluated. The results demonstrated that 120 pesticides were stable (i. e. the mean difference in recovery of pesticides spiked pre and post processing was 20 %); biphenyl, cadusafos, captan, chlorothalonil, dichlorvos, disulfoton, ethoxyquin, etradiazole, <b>heptenophos,</b> malaoxon, phorate, tebuconazole, tecnazene and trifluralin...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, several {{researches}} on {{the acute}} laboratory {{toxicity of pesticides}} to bumblebees have been carried. However, only a few researches on the toxicity of pesticides to bumblebees in semi-field and field-tests have bee conducted, and thus little {{information on this subject}} is available. The Italian Ministry of Agricultural Resources and Forestry financed the “AMA” Project (Ape-Miele-Ambiente) with the aim to intensify researches on toxicological impacts of pesticides on Apoidea. Within this project, we tried to develop an extended laboratory bioassay to evaluate the effects of insecticides and acaricides on bum-blebees. In order to record the behaviour and mortality of bumblebee workers after exposure to plants sprayed with pesticides, special cages offering the bees ample flying space, were built. Prior being transferred into the cages, potted flowering cucumber (Cu-cumis sativus) plants were sprayed with different pesticides at the field rate. Three different classes of pesticides were tested: phosphorganics (chlorpyriphos-methyl, dichlorvos, dimethoate, <b>heptenophos</b> and quinalphos), azotorganics (ethiofencarb and imidacloprid) and pyrethroids (acrinathrin and bifenthrin). In a first test, in each cage, thirty bumblebees were put into contact with the plants 1 hour after the treatment. For the next three days, every 24 hours, abnormal behaviour and bumblebee mortal-ity were recorded. In a second test, the introduction of the bumblebees into the cages was delayed up to 24 hours after the treatment; behaviour and mortality were recorded over the next two days. The cages were housed in a greenhouse and tem...|$|E
40|$|Fifty {{samples of}} honey {{collected}} from local markets of Portugal and Spain during year 2002 were analyzed for 42 organochlorine, carbamate, and organophosphorus pesticide residues. An analytical procedure based on solid-phase extraction with octadecyl sorbent followed by gas chromatography−mass spectrometry (GC−MS), for organochlorines, and by liquid chromatography−atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (LC−APCI-MS), for organophosphorus and carbamates, has been developed. Recoveries of spiked samples ranged from 73 to 98 %, except for dimethoate (40 %), with relative standard deviations from 3 to 16 % {{in terms of}} repeatability, and from 6 to 19 % in terms of reproducibility. Limits of quantification were from 0. 003 to 0. 1 mg kg- 1. Most of the pesticides found in honey were organochlorines. Among them, γ-HCH was the most frequently detected in 50 % of the samples, followed by HCB in 32 % of the samples and the other isomers of HCH (α-HCH and β-HCH) in 28 and 26 % of the samples, respectively. Residues of DDT and their metabolites were detected in 20 % of the samples. Of the studied carbamates, both methiocarb and carbofuran were detected in 10 % of the samples, pirimicarb in 4 % and carbaryl in 2 %. The only organophosphorus pesticides found were <b>heptenophos</b> in 16 %, methidathion in 4 %, and parathion methyl in 2 % of honey samples. Results indicate that Portuguese honeys were more contaminated than Spanish ones. However, honey consumers of both countries should not {{be concerned about the}} amounts of pesticide residues found in honeys available on the market. [URL]...|$|E
