Sometimes threaded or snap-lock plastic standoffs are used, which are less secure, but equally useful in a stationary computer.

50|$|While the CUBy was {{initially}} offered with wooden wing ribs and spars like the Piper Cub, aluminum ribs and spars were later added as an option, also like later Cubs. The aircraft does {{differ from the}} original Piper design in several ways including having its fuselage fabricated from 4130 steel instead of the Cub's original 1025 carbon steel and utilizing a conventional elevator-mounted trim tab {{in place of the}} Cub's <b>jack</b> <b>screw</b> trimming system that adjusts the Cub's elevator angle of incidence.|$|E
50|$|The BM-1 was {{a single}} place biplane with {{conventional}} landing gear and a steerable tail skid. The aircraft used a dropable main fuel tank between the main gear to meet crashworthiness requirements and a small header tank of 10 gallons in the upper wing. Control cables were designed not to use pulleys. The wings had optional metal or wood spars with doped aircraft fabric covering. The fuselage used an all-metal aluminum girder structure with aluminum covering. The horizontal stabilizer used a <b>jack</b> <b>screw</b> for trim adjustment. The engine featured a radiator mounted to the front with a pass-through for the propeller shaft.|$|E

5000|$|A {{jack post}} (telepost, {{adjustable}} steel column) is a steel post {{used in the}} construction trades for temporary support of ceilings, walls and trenches (shoring). The term [...] "jack post" [...] {{is one of many}} describing the same system, other names include any assortment of [...] "adjustable", [...] "steel", [...] "jack" [...] and [...] "shoring" [...] with [...] "post", [...] "column" [...] and [...] "prop", depending on their precise construction - the [...] "jack" [...] refers to examples with a <b>jack</b> <b>screw</b> to adjust the precise length of the post. They are also known by any number of trade names, notably [...] "lally column" [...] and [...] "Acrow prop". Jack posts are widely standardized.|$|E
50|$|Jack posts are {{telescopic}} {{tubular steel}} props {{consisting of two}} primary parts, {{the main part of}} the post, and the <b>jack</b> <b>screw</b> or other adjustable fitting on the end. Both ends are normally fitted with flat metal plates on the end, providing additional support area. Most jack posts are split in two near the middle, with the upper end carrying the jack designed to slide within the lower portion. Gross adjustment for length is first made by pulling a pin and sliding the two sections within each other until they almost fill the gap, inserting the pin to lock them, then using the screw to close any remaining gap. Other designs used two threaded pipes instead of sliding sections, clamping sections, or other similar concepts to lock the system at a specific length.|$|E
50|$|Nearly {{all of the}} Waco Custom Cabins were {{powered by}} radial engines (there being one factory-built exception, the MGC-8) and the {{purchaser}} could specify almost any commercially available engine and Waco would build an aircraft powered by it, hence the profusion of designations, as the first letter indicates the engine installed. Some models were offered in case someone wanted a specific engine but not all were built. Fuselage structure was typical for the period, being welded steel tubing with light wood strips to fair the shape in. The wings were made of spruce with two spars each, having ailerons on only the upper wings, mounted on a false spar. Split flaps were installed on the undersides of the upper wings, though two designs were used depending on model - placed either mid-chord (OC, UC and QC), or in the conventional position at {{the trailing edge of}} the wing (GC and N). The model N was unusual in being the only model with flaps on the lower wings while the model E was the only one with plain flaps. Wing bracing was with a heavily canted N strut joining upper and lower wings, assisted by a single strut bracing the lower wing to the upper fuselage longeron, except on the E series which replaced the single strut with flying and landing wires. Elevators and rudder were aerodynamically counterbalanced and braced with wire cables. Both could be trimmed, the rudder via a ground-adjustable tab, the elevators via <b>jack</b> <b>screw</b> on the OC, UC and QC, while the GC, E and N used a single trim tab on the port (left) elevator. The main landing gear was sprung with oleo struts, and a castoring tailwheel was fitted on all versions except the VN model, which had a nosewheel.|$|E

40|$|Toggle jacks {{are simple}} {{mechanisms}} {{used to drive}} large loads short distances and to lift the heavy loads. It also have the advanced feature of rotating the parts about their axis where {{there is not enough}} space to move the load. The power screw design of a common Toggle jack reduces the amount of force required by the user to drive the mechanism. Most of the Toggle jacks are similar in design, consisting of eight main members out of whom four are driven by a power screw and rest of four by loading condition. In this report, a unique design of a Toggle jack is used to lift the heavy loads at the stable state with the unique condition. In toggle <b>jack</b> <b>screw</b> and nut are main components. A screw is moving part and nut is a stationary part. Both the parts always work in meshing condition. Therefore there are stresses like shear and tensile stresses induced in materials which are responsible for failure of screw. While a nut has bearing stress. Different materials of screw and nut can induce different magnitude of stresses so it is necessary to select a pair of material combination {{in such a way that}} a pair gives induced stress within safe limit. Here we have taken different material combinations of screw and nut & based on that analytical design is done for on different loading condition from 1 KN to 5 KN.

The maximum mechanical advantage possible for a hydraulic jack is not limited by the limitations on <b>screw</b> <b>jacks</b> and can be far greater.

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of many aerospace structures {{is limited by}} the {{accuracy of}} assembly tooling which is in turn limited by the accuracy of the measurements used to set the tooling. Further loss of accuracy results from different rates of thermal expansion for the components and tooling. This paper describes improved tooling designs and setting processes which have the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of aerospace structures. The most advanced solution described is environmentally isolated interferometer networks embedded within tooling combined with active compensation of component pick-ups. This would eliminate environmental effects on measurements while also allowing compensation for thermal expansion. A more immediately realizable solution is the adjustment of component pick-ups using micrometer <b>jacking</b> <b>screws</b> allowing multilateration to be employed during the final stages of the setting process to generate the required offsets...|$|R
