25|$|According to a 2014 {{survey by}} the UNESCO Institute for Statistics of {{innovative}} manufacturing firms in 65 countries, 85% of Brazilian firms are still at the stage of acquiring machinery, equipment and software {{to enable them to}} innovate. Among the other BRICS countries (Russian Federation, India, China and South Africa), the percentage varies between 64% and 71%. Some 17% of Brazilian firms conduct research and development in house, according to the survey, compared to 19% of Russian firms, 35% of Indian firms, 54% of South African firms and 63% of Chinese firms. Brazil is also the BRICS country which outsources research the least (7% of innovative firms), compared to one in ten in India and one in five in the other BRICS. Brazil also trails other Latin American countries. A much higher percentage of firms report <b>in-house</b> <b>research</b> and development in Costa Rica (76%), Argentina (72%), Mexico (43%), El Salvador (42%), Ecuador (35%) and Colombia (22%). Only 6% of Brazilian manufacturing firms collaborate with universities to develop innovative products and processes, a lower ratio than in Mexico (7%), Colombia (11%), Argentina and Cuba (15%) and, above all, Costa Rica (35%).|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} of Sesame Street believed education through television was possible if they captured and sustained children's attention; this meant the show needed a strong appeal. Edward Palmer, the CTW's first Director of Research {{and the man}} Cooney credited with building the CTW's foundation of research, {{was one of the}} few academics in the late 1960s researching children's television. He was recruited by the CTW to test if the curricula developed in the Boston seminars were reaching their audience effectively. Palmer was also tasked with designing and executing the CTW's <b>in-house</b> <b>research</b> and with working with the Educational Testing Service (ETS). His research was so crucial to Sesame Street that Gladwell asserted, [...] "...without Ed Palmer, the show would have never lasted through the first season".|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} {{long known that}} firms can benefit {{substantially}} from basic research. Recently, however, the open innovation literature has questioned whether firms should conduct these basic <b>research</b> activities <b>in-house</b> and has suggested that outsourcing is more appropriate both for small and large firms. However, existing empirical work investigates the performance implications of R&D outsourcing in general, but {{does not take into}} account the differences between basic research on the one hand and more applied R&D on the other. This paper therefore studies whether outsourced basic research indeed contributes equally to firm productivity as <b>in-house</b> basic <b>research,</b> while explicitly incorporating the moderating effect of firm size. A production function approach is applied to firm-level data stemming from three waves of the Flemish R&D survey, combined with data from firms' annual accounts. The results show that small firms benefit from outsourcing their basic research activities. For medium-sized and large firms, however, <b>in-house</b> basic <b>research</b> is more productive than outsourced basic research. These results contradict the general belief that small firms benefit little from basic research and cast doubts on the recent trend to close medium-sized and large firms' corporate labs. status: publishe...|$|R
