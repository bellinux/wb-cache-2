50|$|The idea of {{a parcel}} post may be {{credited}} to Germany, where the growth of railways had brought uniform postal rates throughout Germany and Austria in 1857.

Because of dynamic base less nature and absence of brought together observing focuses, the specially appointed systems are powerless against assaults.

It first breaks down the reason that impromptu system is defenseless against assaults. At that point it introduces the understood assaults and the prevalent secure conventions...|$|R

The cleaner and remote are put on the table, and Pingu is intrigued.

Unable to <b>forward</b> Smith's <b>parcel</b> to [Jacques] Dorthes in Montpellier as communications between there and Geneva have ceased. Lists reasons for delays with his book: ill-health, lack of space, greater temptation of the "delightful verdure of the country", bad winter light, expanding his herbarium, caring for his garden, his wife's ill health, death of their first child, and family matters. As foreseen by Smith he was too communicative about his plans and Haller's son has taken advantage: after sending him specimens and observations received a manuscript titled "Tentamen additament" or "ad Hist. Stirp. Helv. " to be printed in a German magazine in Berne containing articles Haller {{had no idea of}} before their "imprudent communications". Infant son in good health...|$|R
40|$|On 7 February 2000 an {{atypical}} orange discolouration of snowfields in {{the central}} Southern Alps, New Zealand occurred following {{the passage of a}} cold front. Analysis of snow samples identified fine orangey-brown dust mixed with much coarser grey dust. Air <b>parcel</b> <b>forward</b> trajectories from dust sources in southern and central Australia, where dust storms were reported on 4 February 2000, were computed to identify the deposits source. Geochemical analyses of the dust deposit using 26 trace elements, unaffected by regional air pollution and gravitational sorting, indicate that 20 % of the dust was sourced from western New South Wales, with 45 % from the eastern Eyre Peninsula of South Australia and the remaining 35 % was local New Zealand dust. This provenancing approach provides a spatial resolution of long travelled dust sourcing not previously achieved. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|It is {{probable}} that this letter was never sent as it bears no date, valediction, signature or address, appears unfinished, and from references in other letters to a long letter started in January but not sent. ] Currently suffering poor {{physical and mental health}} after discovering that a large part of his herbarium has been spoiled by damp though his recent acquisitions escaped, including wild specimen of 'Daphne alpina' Haller "Historia stirpium" no. 1026. Reminiscences at length on his life, including his first introduction to botany move to Switzerland following father's death, introduction to Smith and increasing passion for the subject, limitations imposed by decreased patrimony, becoming a recluse, and marrying despite intending to remain single; has been unable to botanise in Alps since that time due to becoming a father, also preventing him from publishing his work and legal troubles with his wife's brother. Describes his son and daughter and fears for their future as they are strangers in both the country of their birth and native land of their father and "the desolation of the times in which we live is fit also to inspire melancholy", thinks England is "running headlong into ruin". Disastrous wars have doubled the price of everything and a famine was only narrowly avoided by an abundant potato crop and Turin rice; the armies on the Rhine and a collusion founded on private interest on part of Balsois to supply neighbouring French with grain disrupted the Swiss' usual provision from Suabia. Responds to Smith's letter of 26 September 1794 : would like to know his opinion of the 'Carex' he sent; sent seed of 'Digitalis' and 'Verbascum nigrum'; the 'Biscutella' specimen and seed he sent Smith originally came from seed from Moscow Hort. Demidof.; 'Saxifraga mutata'; plunging temperatures made him fear for his 'Morina'; Rhine armies and cold weather have pushed wolves into areas of human habitation; account of his discovery of 'Cyathea montana' on Mount Suchet for first time in the Jura, hopes this mountain and Davall's stock of books will tempt Smith to visit as well as plants 'Saxifragus hirculus' and 'Carex leporina' Linnaeus, 'Orchis abortiva', and 'Orchis coriophora'. Reports death of [Jean Baptiste François] Bulliard [(1752 - 1793) ] who did "so much in the Fungi"; an error in his plate 333 'Crataegus oxyacantha' fig A should be 'Prunus spinosa' fig B 'Crataegus monogyna' Jacquin.

Received [James] Dickson's outline for a greenhouse but needs fully detailed plans, there being no similar structures in Switzerland.
