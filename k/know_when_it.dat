5|$|In 1919, {{the year}} after the war ended, around 60,000 British {{tourists}} and mourners made pilgrimages to the Western Front. The transatlantic voyage was longer and more expensive from Canada; many attempts to organize large pilgrimages failed, and journeys overseas were largely made individually or in small, unofficial groups. The delegates of the 1928 national convention of the Canadian Legion passed a unanimous resolution asking that a pilgrimage be organized to the Western Front battlefields. A plan began to take form wherein the Legion aimed to coordinate the pilgrimage with the unveiling of the Vimy memorial, which at the time was expected to be completed in 1931 or 1932. Due to construction delays with the memorial, it was not until July 1934 that the Canadian Legion announced a pilgrimage to former battlefield sites in conjunction with the unveiling of the memorial. Although the exact date of the memorial unveiling was still not set, the Legion invited former service members to make tentative reservations with their headquarters in Ottawa. The response from veterans and their families was enthusiastic—1,200 inquiries by November 1934. The Legion presumptuously announced that the memorial would be unveiled on Dominion Day, 1 July 1936, even though the government still did not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> would be completed.|$|E

25|$|Health literacy. This {{is where}} {{patients}} have problems obtaining, processing, and understanding basic health information. For example, {{patients with a}} poor understanding of good health may not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is necessary to seek care for certain symptoms. While problems with health literacy {{are not limited to}} minority groups, the problem can be more pronounced in these groups than in whites due to socioeconomic and educational factors. A study conducted in Mdantsane, South Africa depicts the correlation of maternal education and the antenatal visits for pregnancy. As patients have a greater education, they tend to use maternal health care services more than those with a lesser maternal education background.|$|E

500|$|According to Nielsen ratings, [...] "I Dream of Jesus" [...] was the most-watched {{program on}} Fox the night it {{originally}} aired.

Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 7/10, claiming the episode had entertaining moments, but {{was not one of}} the show's strongest efforts. Haque wrote, [...] "Jesus on Family Guy should have been a big deal and featured far more laughs than it did." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V.

Bozell said [...] "this lying, slacker Jesus is even dumber than Peter, the greatest idiot on animated television today." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number nine on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] due its use of the 'Sufin Bird' song and quipped that [...] "you never <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> might strike again." ...|$|E

500|$|Migratory birds may use two {{electromagnetic}} {{tools to}} find their destinations: one that is entirely innate and another that relies on experience. A young bird on its first migration flies in the correct direction according to the Earth's magnetic field, but {{does not know how}} far the journey will be. It does this through a radical pair mechanism whereby chemical reactions in special photo pigments sensitive to long wavelengths are affected by the field. Although this only works during daylight hours, it does not use the position of the sun in any way. At this stage the bird is in the position of a Boy Scout with a compass but no map, until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use. With experience it learns various landmarks and this [...] "mapping" [...] is done by magnetites in the trigeminal system, which tell the bird how strong the field is. Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions, the magnetic field strengths at different latitudes let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> has reached its destination. There is a neural connection between the eye and [...] "Cluster N", the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation, suggesting that birds may actually {{be able to see the}} magnetic field of the earth.|$|E

2500|$|Buffer {{overflows}} work {{by manipulating}} pointers (including stored addresses). [...] PointGuard was proposed as a compiler-extension to prevent attackers {{from being able}} to reliably manipulate pointers and addresses. [...] The approach works by having the compiler add code to automatically XOR-encode pointers before and after they are used. [...] Because the attacker (theoretically) does not know what value will be used to encode/decode the pointer, he cannot predict what it will point to if he overwrites it with a new value. [...] PointGuard was never released, but Microsoft implemented a similar approach beginning in Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1. [...] Rather than implement pointer protection as an automatic feature, Microsoft added an API routine that can be called at the discretion of the programmer. [...] This allows for better performance (because it is not used all of the time), but places the burden on the programmer to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>it</b> is necessary.|$|E
