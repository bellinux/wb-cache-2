[...] "If there hasn't been one by now, I doubt it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> wonderful." ...|$|E

500|$|Voss {{returned}} from leave on 23 September 1917 {{not yet fully}} rested; as fellow pilot Leutnant Alois Heldmann observed: [...] "He had the nervous instability of a cat. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fair {{to say he was}} flying on his nerves." [...] Nevertheless, Voss flew a morning mission and shot down an Airco DH.4 from 57 Squadron at 09:30 hours. Upon his return to his air base with bullet holes in his Fokker, he took advantage of Richthofen's absence at the Voss family hunting lodge to celebrate with a victory loop before landing. In contrast to Voss's usual tidy flying garb, he was wearing striped gray trousers, a dirty gray sweater, and tall lace-up boots.|$|E
500|$|After {{graduating from}} Princeton in 1971, Berg decided {{to expand the}} thesis into a {{full-length}} biography, thinking it would take around nine months. He also formulated a career plan at this time, and later recalled: [...] "I did tell myself early on: <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interesting, perhaps, to spend a career writing a half-dozen biographies of twentieth-century American cultural figures—each one, as I often use as my metaphor, a different wedge of the great apple pie." [...] The Perkins biography, Max Perkins: Editor of Genius, took longer than Berg anticipated and was eventually published in 1978, winning a National Book Award in Biography. In 2016, The New Yorker credited Berg with [...] "almost single-handedly rescu Maxwell Perkins from the anonymity he desired." ...|$|E

[...] "To me this is a really {{interesting}} time to be in this position and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> in a way irresponsible not to put my best foot forward and lead us into a different time." [...] In September, The September Issue, a documentary film by The War Room producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. She appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy. The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.|$|E

Cordray noted that when he assumed statewide office, Ohio was challenged with restoring public trust after the misdeeds of former Ohio Governor Bob Taft. Referring to what {{in a similar way}} would be required to follow Ohio Attorney General Marc Dann and his interim successor Nancy Rogers he said: [...] "... we have been patiently rebuilding the public trust there [...] and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a very similar task there in the Attorney General's office."

500|$|Leigh's death {{received}} {{widespread and}} ongoing coverage {{in both the}} Sydney and Newcastle media, possibly due to a fascination with her reduplicated name. Between 1989 and 1994, The Newcastle Herald ran at least 39 stories on Leigh, 23 of them featured on the front page. At least ten articles on the case were published in The Sydney Morning Herald during the same period. Both the extended media coverage and the theatrical plays and film the murder inspired have led to it being termed a [...] "celebrity crime", and to Leigh being {{referred to as a}} [...] "celebrity victim". In 1996 Psychologist Roger Peters attributed the media fascination to the sense of community in Stockton, and due to the crimes being committed by people not considered to be typical criminals, [...] stating [...] "I think one of the main things is that people can identify with people involved. Had it of been a criminal from outside who stalked her and killed <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> long forgotten." ...|$|E
500|$|The group {{wrote and}} {{performed}} children's music {{that was different}} from {{what had been done}} previously; as Cook stated, [...] "we didn't just go down the route of what people think is kids' music". [...] They were not tied to one style or genre of music and often experimented in the studio; while some of their recordings were orchestral, others had a more live feel. The group was aware that their songs were often children's first exposure to music. Guitar Magazine speculated that since Cook {{was one of the first}} guitarists children were exposed to, he may be the most influential guitarist in the world. [...] Cook was conscious that he was probably the first guitarist children would see, and said, [...] "I always think that if it inspires kids to play guitar later on that would be great. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> really nice if in 15years I read that somebody got into guitar playing because of [...] Wiggles". [...] In 2013, after Cook retired from touring with the group and became their touring manager, he reported that newer bands like Regular John approached him and said that The Wiggles were the first band [...] "they got into".|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Feige {{said that}} [...] "in an ideal world" [...] {{releases}} each year would include one film {{based on an}} existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's [...] "a nice rhythm" [...] in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, he said it is [...] "certainly something to aim for." [...] Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, [...] "I don't know that we'll keep to [...] every year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, [...] "so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> fun to continue that sort of thing." [...] In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the [...] "rhythm" [...] that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like [...] "a big event or crossover series," [...] with Avengers films acting as [...] "big, giant linchpins." [...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I {{think if you look}} at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going." [...] After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said, [...] "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [...] instead of just two, without changing our methods." ...|$|E
