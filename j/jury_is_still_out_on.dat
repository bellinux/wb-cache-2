500|$|This episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic {{said that the}} plot of the episode had a [...] "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a [...] "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping for more of {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the <b>jury</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E

We define social development by a combination of health and education outcomes. We find that, after controlling for per-capita income and a bunch of other macroeconomic and institutional factors, a higher dependence on (point and diffuse) natural resources causes social underdevelopment. The estimation of a system of equations indicates two possible transmission mechanisms. One operates via income inequality, the other via macroeconomic volatility. ...|$|R
