5|$|Grand Lodges and Grand Orients are {{independent}} and sovereign bodies that govern Masonry {{in a given}} country, state, or <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> (termed a jurisdiction).

5|$|Nurkse also refuted {{the claim}} that if a country's <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> is large, {{the size of its}} market also ought to be large. A country may be {{extremely}} small in area but still have a large effective demand. For example, Japan. In contrast, a country may cover a huge <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> but its market may still be small. This may occur if {{a large part of the}} country is uninhabitable, or if the country suffers from low productivity levels and thus has a low National Income.|$|E

5|$|Unlike the Badami Chalukyan temples {{featured}} in detailed studies by Henry Cousens (1927), Gary Tartakov (1969) and George Michell (1975), Western Chalukyan architecture suffered neglect despite its importance and wider use. Recently however, scholars {{have returned to}} the modern Karnataka region to focus on a longer chronology, investigating a larger <b>geographical</b> <b>area,</b> making detailed studies of epigraphs and giving more importance to individual monuments dating from the 11th through 13th centuries.|$|E

5|$|More {{schools for}} the deaf were founded after ASD, and {{knowledge}} of ASL spread to these schools. In addition, the rise of Deaf community organizations bolstered the continued use of ASL. Societies such as the National Association of the Deaf and the National Fraternal Society of the Deaf held national conventions that attracted signers from across the country. This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large <b>geographical</b> <b>area,</b> atypical of a sign language.|$|E
5|$|Southeast Asian musical {{innovations}} {{include those}} {{during a period}} of Indian influence that ended around 920 AD. Balinese and Javanese music made use of xylophones and metallophones, bronze versions of the former. The most prominent and important musical instrument of Southeast Asia was the gong. While the gong likely originated in the <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> between Tibet and Burma, it was part of every category of human activity in maritime Southeast Asia including Java.|$|E

5|$|A {{habitat is}} made up of {{physical}} factors such as soil, moisture, range of temperature, and light intensity as well as biotic factors such as the availability of food and {{the presence or absence of}} predators. Every organism has certain habitat needs for the conditions in which it will thrive, but some are tolerant of wide variations while others are very specific in their requirements. A habitat is not necessarily a <b>geographical</b> <b>area,</b> it can be the interior of a stem, a rotten log, a rock or a clump of moss, and for a parasitic organism it is the body of its host, part of the host's body such as the digestive tract, or a single cell within the host's body.|$|E
5|$|Although set in {{a similar}} {{historical}} period and <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> to the unmodified game (covering a timespan of 272 BC to 14 AD, compared to the original game's 270 BC to 14 AD), Europa Barbarorum is a total conversion modification as it replaces all the aspects of the original Rome: Total War game that can be replaced, such as unit models, statistics and the musical score. The modification has received favourable reviews {{in a number of}} computer gaming magazines. PC Gamer magazine ranks Europa Barbarorum as the best mod for any of the seven Total War games released for the PC at that time.|$|E
5|$|Badajoz was {{the birthplace}} of the statesman Manuel de Godoy, the duke of Alcudia (1767–1851). Many of the provincial {{administration}} buildings are located in Badajoz, as well as the government buildings of the municipal administration. Politically, Badajoz belongs to the Spanish Congress Electoral District of Badajoz, which is the largest electoral district about of 52 districts in the Spanish Congress of Deputies in terms of <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> and includes {{a significant part of the}} Extremadura region. The electoral district was first contested in modern times in the 1977 General Election. At the time of the 2011 election, Badajoz had six deputies representing the district in congress, four from the People's Party-United Extremadura party (PP-EU), and two from the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party party (PSOE).|$|E

5|$|Exclusive Jurisdiction is {{a concept}} whereby only one Grand Lodge will be {{recognised}} in any <b>geographical</b> <b>area.</b> If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will {{have to choose between}} them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one. (In 1849, for example, the Grand Lodge of New York split into two rival factions, each claiming to be the legitimate Grand Lodge. Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).|$|E
5|$|For Constantine's {{last years}} as king {{there is only}} the meagre record of the Chronicle of the Kings of Alba. The death of Æthelstan is reported, as are two others. The first of these, in 938, is that of Dubacan, mormaer of Angus or son of the mormaer. Unlike the report of 918, on this {{occasion}} the title mormaer {{is attached to a}} <b>geographical</b> <b>area,</b> but it is unknown whether the Angus of 938 was in any way similar to the later mormaerdom or earldom. The second death, entered with that of Æthelstan, is that of Eochaid mac Ailpín, who may, from his name, have been a kinsman of Constantín.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} map {{itself of}} Europa Barbarorum covers a wider <b>geographical</b> <b>area</b> {{than that of}} Rome: Total War, expanding into {{areas such as the}} Arabian Peninsula, India, Central Asia, and Scandinavia. Relief, province boundaries, snow boundaries, vegetation types, coastlines and areas prone to natural disaster in 272 BC have all been researched and implemented into the campaign map. The Nile–Red Sea canal linking the Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea has been added to the map, as have the great trade routes of the ancient world, such as the Amber and Silk Roads, which can be captured and exploited by the player or by the artificial intelligence.|$|E
