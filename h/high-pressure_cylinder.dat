50|$|The {{locomotive}} used saturated steam. The <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> had piston valves arranged {{above the}} cylinders, while the low-pressure cylinders had Allen Richardson balanced slide valves, also arranged above the cylinders and all actuated by Walschaerts valve gear. Copper steam pipes were arranged {{on each side}} of the dome and passed vertically down outside the boiler to the steam chests of the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinders.</b> The exhaust from the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> passed through a receiver pipe along the centre of the engine to the low-pressure cylinders. The exhaust from the low-pressure cylinders passed to the smokebox and blast pipe through a pipe fitted with flexible connections.|$|R
25|$|The tandem {{compound}} {{first appeared on}} the Erie Railroad in 1867. Like the Vauclain compound, a {{tandem compound}} has each pair of high- and low-pressure cylinders driving a common crosshead, connecting rod and crank; but unlike the Vauclain compound, the cylinders are mounted fore and aft of each other. The rear wall of the forward cylinder is usually the forward wall of the rear cylinder. The piston rod of the rear cylinder {{is connected to the}} crosshead in the usual way, but the forward cylinder may have its piston rod, or rods, in either of two forms: either the piston rod of the rear cylinder is extended forwards to also carry the forward piston; or if the forward cylinder be the low-pressure cylinder (and thus larger in diameter than the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> behind), it may have two long piston rods which pass above and below, or to either side, of the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> in order to reach the common crosshead.|$|E
25|$|In 1824, the Allaire Works {{built the}} engine for , the first {{steamship}} {{in the world}} fitted with a compound engine. The <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> was 12inches in diameter and the low-pressure cylinder 24inches, with both having a stroke of 4 feet. In the same year, the Allaire Works also supplied a compound engine for a 200-ton towboat called Post Boy, and another for a small steamer, Linnaeus.|$|E
25|$|In 1889 Samuel M. Vauclain of the Baldwin Locomotive Works {{devised the}} Vauclain {{compound}} locomotive. This design used a double-expansion engine fitted {{into the space}} occupied by a conventional single-expansion engine on the locomotive, using a single piston valve with conventional gear to control both the high- and low-pressure cylinders. The <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> could be placed above or below the low-pressure cylinder, each had its own piston rod connected to a common crosshead, so that one connecting rod and crank was required for each pair of cylinders. Substantial fuel efficiencies were achieved, but maintenance difficulties doomed the type. Most were converted to conventional engines.|$|E
25|$|Unlike in Garratt's patent, Tasmanian Railways {{insisted on}} a {{compound}} arrangement with cylinders facing inwards, {{in order to reduce}} the distances between both the main steam pipe and the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinders,</b> and between the <b>high-pressure</b> and low-pressure <b>cylinders.</b> This made the locomotive unnecessarily complicated and placed the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinders</b> directly underneath the cab, making it uncomfortably hot, especially in summer. The pattern was not repeated on later Garratt designs. Only one more Garratt locomotive, again built by Beyer, Peacock & Co. in 1927, was produced with compound propulsion for the Burma Railways.|$|R

25|$|Melville mounted Maines engines {{with the}} {{cylinders}} in vertical mode, {{a departure from}} conventional practice. Previous ships had had their engines mounted in horizontal mode, {{so that they would}} be completely protected below the waterline. Melville believed a ship's engines needed ample room to operate and that any exposed parts could be protected by an armored deck. He therefore opted for the greater efficiency, lower maintenance costs and higher speeds offered by the vertical mode. Also, the engines were constructed with the <b>high-pressure</b> <b>cylinder</b> aft and the low-pressure cylinder forward. This was done, according to the ship's chief engineer, A. W. Morley, so the low-pressure cylinder could be disconnected when the ship was under low power. This allowed the high and intermediate-power cylinders to be run together as a compound engine for economical running.|$|E

However, skirmishes between the rival destroyer screens convinced the German commander, Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, that he was confronted with the entire Grand Fleet. He broke off the engagement and turned for home. A fleet sortie to the Dogger Bank took place on 24 April 1915.

50|$|The most {{noticeable}} external {{difference from the}} experimental Class MD engine was the altered arrangement of the main steam pipes necessitated by the superheater.
