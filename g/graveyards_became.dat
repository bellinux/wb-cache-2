50|$|In Laurell K.

That, or numerous animators (or people who possess magic related to the dead) are buried in the graveyard. Though they were once human, they are like lone wolves, and they are not very smart. The only reason Zach's ghouls stayed and worked together was because Zach was controlling them. They will only attack if a person is vulnerable. A ghoul will run from a healthy, strong human being, and is afraid of fire. Like zombies, ghouls have human strength, but seem stronger because the sensations of pain and the 'governors' that keep people from ripping their bodies apart died with them. So while a human would stop trying to punch a hole in a steel door because of the pain a zombie or ghoul would keep trying until stopped or the door broke even if it would mean completely destroying their arm in the process.|$|E

Near 382 Pope Damasus built the semi-hypogeum basilica and the catacomb ceased being a <b>graveyard</b> and <b>became</b> a place of worship of the martyrs there buried. In 682 Pope Leo II moved the relics of the martyrs of Generosa in the church of Santa Bibiana on the Esquiline Hill: the catacomb was thereby gradually abandoned and its location was forgotten.|$|R

50|$|Geodynamic mantle {{convection}} {{models have}} included compositional distinctive material. The material {{tends to get}} swept up in ridges or piles. When including realistic past plate motions into the modeling, the material gets swept up in locations that are remarkably similar {{to the present day}} location of the LLSVPs. These locations also correspond with known slab graveyard locations mentioned in the origin section. These types of models, as well as the observation that the degree two structure of the LLSVPs is orthogonal to the path of true polar wander, suggest these mantle structures have been stable over large amounts of time. This geometrical relationship is also consistent with the position of the supercontinent Pangaea, and the formation of the current geoid pattern due to continental break-up from the superswell below.However, the heat from the core is not enough to sustain the energy needed to fuel the superplume(s) located at the LLSVPs. There is a phase transition from perovskite to post-perovskite from the down welling slab(s) that causes an exothermic reaction. This exothermic reaction helps to heat the LLSVP, but it is not sufficient enough to account for the total energy needed to sustain it. So it is hypothesized that the material from the slab <b>graveyard</b> can <b>become</b> extremely dense and form large pools of melt concentrate enriched in uranium, thorium, and potassium. These concentrated radiogenic elements are thought to provide the high temperatures needed. So, the appearance and disappearance of slab graveyards predicts the birth and death of an LLSVP, potentially changing the dynamics of all plate tectonics.|$|R

5000|$|Day of the Dead is {{the most}} {{important}} celebration in this community, with two days of ritual and cultural events from November 1 to 2. The village and its church <b>graveyard</b> has <b>become</b> famous in the Mexico City metropolitan area for this. In and around the cemetery, thousands of Mexican and international visitors experience the sights, sound and smells of the rituals, cultural events and stands selling food, crafts and other items. The modern celebrations are an extension of the cult of the dead that existed here since pre-Hispanic times. Excavations in this area have revealed a large quantity of stone skulls that used to adorn the facades of homes in this area. Solemn commemoration and festivities do not compete here; both are considered part of the event. In addition to the traditional altars to the dead called “ofrendas”, grave cleanings and decoration, there are also plays, processions, poetry readings, concerts and folk dance. In 2009, the finale was a concert by Susana Harp.Preparations for this celebration can begin two or three months in advance, when families begin to buy plates and utensils that will be used only for ofrendas and women embroider napkins and tablecloths for the occasion. In mid-October, residents place a large paper star lantern over their doorways, which will remain until November 3. The purpose of this star is to help guide the dead who come back to visit. [...] In {{the days leading up to}} the Day of the Dead, fields around the community that have been planted with cempoalxóchitl bloom and the fragrance can be detected. Other aromas, such as those of fruits in season and pan de muerto have given rise to the expression “ya huele a muertos”(now it smells like the dead) or “ya se siente muertitos” (now the dear (lit. little) dead can be felt) indicating that Day of the Dead is near. In the public primary schools, students and teachers arrange Day of the Dead altars, called ofrendas, with the teachers arranging the school’s large altar and students creating miniature ones, sometimes with themes. These are placed on public display, with the ofrendas of the Cristobal Colon Primary School the most visited due to the school’s location near the church. Days before celebrations begin, tomb cleaning and repair commences.|$|R
40|$|In many {{developing}} countries up to 30 % of tractors are standing idle {{because of a lack}} of replacement parts. Surveys indicate that in Africa alone there are some 100, 000 tractors in a state of disrepair. Machinery <b>graveyards</b> have <b>become</b> all too common. However, recent initiatives demonstrate that such machinery can be rehabilitated to virtually 'es new' so limiting the expense of importing new machines. Controversy continues on the issue of farm mechanization in developing countries. Many tractors and other items of agricultural equipment fail after relatively short working lives. Therefore, as long as they are appropriate, why not rehabilitate them? Equipment purchased with scarce foreign exchange and now idle for want of repair represents wasted investment. Often a relatively small input could mobilize these power units for cultivation and transport. In 1982 a pilot tractor rehabilitation scheme was set up in Mozambique. In 1979 it had been estimated that 50 % of the tractors in the country were inoperative through premature failure. Since 70 % of the national tractor fleet were Massey-Ferguson models, the company was involved in devising an innovative solution to this dire situation. This programme of rehabilitation, overhaul and certification became known as the ROC scheme. The ROC scheme not only repairs the tractor, but also upgrades it so that the completed machine is equivalent to the latest model in that range produced by the Company. All the essential components (engine, clutch, gearbox and hydraulics) are replaced with current specification assemblies and the tractor is re-sprayed. On completion the machine is given a full warranty and new registration. Tractor owners hand over their old tractor, and it is rebuilt as an ROC tractor for approximately 75 % of the cost of an equivalent new import. The ROC or Rebuild scheme has now rehabilitated over 5, 000 tractors in projects in Africa covering Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nigeria, Somalia, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe. Another, less costly alternative is the basic rehabilitation scheme where each tractor is assessed and renovated according to its individual needs. Unserviceable parts are repaired or replaced and the tractor is returned to its owner as new. The benefit of this option is that a tractor can be restored to excellent working order for between one third and one half of the price of an equivalent new machine. Massey-Fergusonremains the major manufacturers involved in both the complete rebuild and selective replacement schemes, but a renovation programme for Ford tractors was launched in Tanzania alongside the Massey-Ferguson programme. National benefits The rehabilitation and rebuild programmes are operated mainly by the tractor manufacturers' local distributors. The aim is to employ and train local staff so that once the initial project is completed, trained mechanics are available to carry out regular service and maintenance in the future. The indirect causes of premature equipment failure have included government policies towards agricultural mechanization which have underestimated the training required, not only of operators and service managers but also of distributor staff and government staff. Government policies have also penalized imports of replacement parts. Rehabilitation and repair projects have demonstrated that training and expenditure on essential replacement is not so much a cost to the nation as a saving. Could local industries provide even more employment and save more foreign exchange by manufacturing replacement parts locally? The answer is yes, although with strict limitations. Manufacturers, who are going to guarantee rehabilitated equipment, wish to ensure that all replacement parts are made to the stringent standards demanded for the proper functioning and long life of engines and other moving parts that have to work under severe mechanical load. Unless a tractor maker has a subsidiary company in a country, the highly engineered components of engines and bearings will almost certainly have to be imported. Components such as radiators, electrical systems, water pumps, clutch assemblies, brake shoes and fuel injection equipment could readily be reconditioned locally. However, even these repair shops would need to be specialized, have appropriate inputs of technical data to ensure the required specification, and pay attention to quality control. Future development of parts manufacturing industries will depend on the size of the domestic market and any prospects for export. The commitment of governments to industrialization will be fundamental. Meanwhile the current level of commitment by several governments has already ensured a dramatic improvement in the serviceability of tractor fleets at relatively modest cost and with the benefits of local employment and training. Direct benefits for the agricultural sector have resulted through the provision of 'as good as new' equipment at prices more farmers can afford. In {{many developing}} countries up to 30 % of tractors are standing idle {{because of a lack of}} replacement parts.
