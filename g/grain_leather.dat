25|$|As in {{previous}} years, the 1985 Ninety-Eight was {{available as a}} 4-door sedan and a 2-door coupe, in either Regency or Regency Brougham trim. Both models came with standard velour seating, with Sierra <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> optional on both. For the first year, the Buick 181in³ V6 was the standard powerplant. V8 engines were gone for good, never {{to return to the}} Ninety-Eight. Optional engines were Buick's 231 and Oldsmobile's 263in³ Diesel V6. The 3.0 gas V6 and 4.3 Diesel V6 were dropped for 1986.|$|E
25|$|Early on 14 June 1809, near Cape Croisette {{south of}} Marseilles, Raitt {{encountered}} {{a convoy of}} 14 Spanish merchant vessels and two gunboats. Scout set off in pursuit but after the wind dropped in the afternoon Raitt had to continue the pursuit using his boats. The convoy dispersed as seven of the vessels headed for a small nearby harbour. Scouts boats went in under fire from a shore battery. A landing party captured the battery, spiking the two 6-pounder guns there. The boats then captured and sailed out the seven Spanish vessels. British casualties were one man killed and five wounded. The Spanish vessels were carrying wool, <b>grain,</b> <b>leather,</b> flour and cheese. Raitt destroyed two of the vessels after removing their cargoes; the five others he sent to Port Mahon.|$|E

5000|$|Horween Leather Company {{produces}} {{many different}} full grain and corrected <b>grain</b> <b>leathers.</b> Its leather {{is used in}} a number of products including footwear, sports equipment, bags, belts, wallets, briefcases, suitcases, jackets, coats, and other apparel and accessories. [...] As of 2003, 60% of the company's leather was used to make clothes, shoes, and accessories, and 40% for sporting goods such as footballs, basketballs, and baseball gloves.|$|R
5000|$|Corrected-grain leather is any leather {{that has}} had an {{artificial}} grain applied to its surface. The hides used to create corrected leather {{do not meet the}} standards for use in creating vegetable-tanned or aniline leather. The imperfections are corrected or sanded off, and an artificial grain embossed into the surface and dressed with stain or dyes. Most corrected-grain leather is used to make pigmented leather as the solid pigment helps hide the corrections or imperfections. Corrected <b>grain</b> <b>leathers</b> can mainly be bought as two finish types: semi-aniline and pigmented.|$|R

50|$|Among {{the main}} {{economic}} activities, a primary industry was salt mining from brine {{at a site}} between Caralis and Quartu, still undertaken today. This salt as well as <b>grain,</b> <b>leather</b> (tanned in establishments found near the port) and other products made in Sardinia were exported to other provinces of the empire.|$|E
5000|$|A second {{criticism}} {{is that the}} suede boots are too easily damaged and impossible to clean if {{they are exposed to}} grease, oil, or other petroleum products. In 2011, a new [...] "Maintainer" [...] style of boot, made with sage green full <b>grain</b> <b>leather,</b> was authorized for wear by all airmen to address these concerns.|$|E
50|$|On the inside, Rolls-Royce fitted re-designed front seats, and re-angled {{the rear}} seats {{so as to}} allow for easier {{communication}} with other passengers. The clock fascia and instrument dials gained polished metal chaplets that evoke premium watch design. Natural <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> could now be fitted to the A and C pillars, and two new veneers became available.|$|E
50|$|Oiling {{provides}} the leather with lubrication and {{allows it to}} flex repeatedly without cracking. Leather fibres that are dry and un-lubricated break very easily. Oiling does impart colour and an element of water resistance. Oiling would normally be performed on full <b>grain</b> aniline <b>leathers.</b> The {{most common type of}} leather oiled is vegetable tanned leather.|$|R
50|$|The {{vegetable}} tanned skins used {{in production}} have {{the quality of}} permanently retaining the embossed imprint of motifs or batiks. A cotton pad or a glass, which has a smooth surface, is {{used to make the}} <b>grains</b> of the <b>leather</b> shine.|$|R
5000|$|Split leather is leather {{created from}} the fibrous {{part of the}} hide left once the top-grain of the rawhide has been {{separated}} from the hide. During the splitting operation, the top-grain and drop split are separated. The drop split can be further split (thickness allowing) into a middle split and a flesh split. In very thick hides, the middle split can be separated into multiple layers until the thickness prevents further splitting. Split leather then has an artificial layer applied {{to the surface of}} the split and is embossed with a <b>leather</b> <b>grain</b> (bycast <b>leather).</b> Splits are also used to create suede. The strongest suedes are usually made from grain splits (that have the grain completely removed) or from the flesh split that has been shaved to the correct thickness. Suede is [...] "fuzzy" [...] on both sides. Manufacturers use a variety of techniques to make suede from full-grain. A reversed suede is a grained leather that has been designed into the leather article with the grain facing away from the visible surface. It is not considered a true suede.|$|R

50|$|Kip full <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> was a Water Buffalo hide {{impregnated}} with tallow, {{oils and}} waxes; {{it was made}} in India. Split Kip was split leather and was often used just on the heel (the quarters). The presence of wax and oil made the leather hard, and necessitated a heated Half Round Bottom Glazer for shaping over the last. Kip lasts up to 40 years, but is no longer imported.|$|E

5000|$|Being a {{man-made}} material, it is washable and retains its softness when wet, unlike natural leather. After many decades of development, Clarino has achieved performance that exceeds that of leather in some applications, especially where the item may {{be exposed to}} water, such as riding saddles. Top <b>grain</b> <b>leather</b> applications include [...] "patent leather" [...] shoes that retain high gloss {{without the need for}} polish. During manufacturing it is microscopically perforated to give it breathability similar to that of natural leather. Clarino is based on a non-woven fabric composed of special synthetic fibers that are intertwined three-dimensionally. The material’s softness and suppleness arise from the structure of the non-woven fabric’s special fibers—a superfine fiber construction and tiny cavities.|$|E

Access to the ladder was by a small door in the rear. There were no front doors. Coachwork was made of high quality using wood, probably by a local carriage builder as with other Packards.

50|$|Most {{studies of}} {{historical}} smuggling {{have been based}} on official sources — such as court records, or the letters of Revenue Officers. According to Dr Evan Jones (University of Bristol), the trouble with these is that 'they only detail the activities of those dumb enough to get caught'. This has led him and others, such as Prof Huw Bowen (University of Swansea) to use commercial records to reconstruct smuggling businesses. Jones' study focuses on smuggling in Bristol in the mid-16th century, arguing that the illicit export of goods like <b>grain</b> and <b>leather</b> represented {{a significant part of the}} city's business, with many members of the civic elite engaging in it. Grain smuggling by members of the civic elite, often working closely with corrupt customs officers, has also been shown to have been prevalent in East Anglia during the later 16th century.|$|R

The Imperial line utilized mahogany as their primary wood, usually stained dark brown with a silvery sheen, created by grain filler, probably silex or calcium chloride. The line was solid and heavy, accented by top quality ironwork. Originally the line was upholstered in a multicolored cotton weave in a fiesta-influenced pattern.

5000|$|Leather gloves: These gloves {{are worn}} by criminals because the tactile {{properties}} of the leather allow for good grip and dexterity. These properties {{are the result of}} the grain present {{on the surface of the}} glove. The grain makes the surface of the leather unique to each glove. Over time, the pores and <b>grain</b> of <b>leather</b> gloves will pick up dirt and grease from surfaces that they have touched or handled. The dirt and grease can in return help to create prints on surfaces. Also, unlined gloves provide the most dexterity but can over time become saturated with the oils and sweat of the wearer's hands. This helps to increase the gripping {{properties of the}} gloves but causes the gloves to leave prints. A print that contains the glove wearer's sweat and oils will contain their DNA, which can incriminate them. Investigators are able to dust for the marks left behind from leather the same way they dust for fingerprints.|$|R
