60|$|From the Vivi Rapids to Nsundi {{along the}} {{windings}} {{of the bed}} is a total of 115 miles, about the distance of Vivi to the sea; the direct land march was 75 miles. Captain Tuckey heard nothing of the Lumini River entering 43 leagues above the Yellala, and he gives no professional opinion touching the navigability of the total of six greater rapids which, to judge <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> saw, <b>can</b> hardly offer any serious obstruction {{to the development of}} the Nzadi.|$|R
6000|$|He {{described}} {{the division between}} rich and poor peasants, and the Government propaganda among the latter against the former, leading to acts of violence which he seemed to find amusing. He spoke as though the dictatorship over the peasant would have to continue a long time, because of the peasant's desire for free trade. He said he knew <b>from</b> statistics (<b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> well believe) that the peasants have had more to eat these last two years than they ever had before, [...] "and yet they are against us," [...] he added a little wistfully. <b>I</b> asked him <b>what</b> to reply to critics who say that in the country he has merely created peasant proprietorship, not Communism; he replied that that is not quite the truth, but he did not say what the truth is.[3] ...|$|R
5|$|Now Sunderland {{found out}} {{how hard it is}} to score against this terrific defence of ours.

5000|$|Semi-final opponents Sunderland found Birmingham without [...] "hard-man" [...] left-half Roy Warhurst, who had injured a thigh against Arsenal, but in Jack Badham {{they had}} an {{effective}} replacement. The club's official history describes this as [...] "probably the finest team performance against top class opposition ever produced" [...] by a Birmingham team. They attacked from the kick-off and nullified Sunderland's pressure {{and the threat of}} Len Shackleton. Noel Kinsey scored early and the second goal came from a passing move down the left side finished by Astall. As Sunderland threw everyone forward, which left them open at the back, Brown picked up a long through ball and lobbed the goalkeeper. Astall said afterwards that he was surprised they had not scored five, and Brown wrote in his newspaper column:Now Sunderland found out {{how hard it is to}} score against this terrific defence of ours.

6000|$|I am truly {{glad that}} the Tales have amused you. In my poor opinion [...] {{they are the best}} of the four sets, though perhaps I only think so [...] on account of their opening ground less {{familiar}} to me than the [...] manners of the Highlanders. [...] . If Tom--[His brother, Mr. Thomas [...] Scott.]--wrote those volumes, he has not put me in his secret. [...] General rumour here attributes them to a very ingenious but most [...] unhappy man, a clergyman of the Church of Scotland, who, many years [...] since, was obliged to retire from his profession, and from society, [...] who hides himself under a borrowed name. This hypothesis seems to [...] account satisfactorily for the rigid secrecy observed; but <b>from</b> <b>what</b> [...] <b>I</b> <b>can</b> recollect of the unfortunate individual, these are not the [...] kind of productions I should expect from him. Burley, if I mistake [...] not, was on board the Prince of Orange's own vessel at the time of [...] his death. There was also in the Life Guards such a person as [...] Francis Stewart, grandson of the last Earl of Bothwell. I have in my [...] possession various proceedings at his father's instance for [...] recovering some part of the Earl's large estates which had been [...] granted to the Earls of Buccleugh and Roxburgh. It would appear that [...] Charles I. made some attempts to reinstate him in those lands, but, [...] like most of that poor monarch's measures, the attempt only served [...] to augment his own enemies, for Buccleugh {{was one of the first}} who [...] declared against him in Scotland, and raised a regiment of twelve [...] hundred men, of whom my grandfather's grandfather (Sir William Scott [...] of Harden) was lieutenant-colonel. This regiment was very active at [...] the destruction of Montrose's Highland army at Philiphaugh. In [...] Charles the Second's time the old knight suffered as much through [...] the nonconformity of his wife as Cuddie through that of his mother. [...] My father's grandmother, who lived to the uncommon age of [...] ninety-eight years, perfectly remembered being carried, when a [...] child, to the field-preachings, where the clergyman thundered from [...] the top of a rock, and the ladies sat upon their side-saddles, which [...] were placed upon the turf for their accommodation, while the men [...] stood round, all armed with swords and pistols. [...] . Old Mortality [...] was a living person; I have myself seen him about twenty years ago [...] repairing the Covenanters' tombs as far north as Dunnottar.|$|R

I took out the list of Professor Challenger's exploits, and I read it over under the electric lamp. Then <b>I</b> had <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> only regard as an inspiration. As a Pressman, <b>I</b> felt sure <b>from</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had been told that I could never hope to get into touch with this cantankerous Professor. But these recriminations, twice mentioned in his skeleton biography, could only mean that he was a fanatic in science. Was there not an exposed margin there upon which he might be accessible? I would try.|$|R
