25|$|Van Ronk refused {{for many}} years to fly and never learned to drive (he would use trains or buses or, when possible, recruit a girlfriend or young {{musician}} as his driver), and he declined to ever move from Greenwich Village for any extended period of time (having stayed in California for a short time in the 1960s). Van Ronk's trademark stoneware <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> Tullamore Dew was frequently seen on stage next to him in his early days.|$|E
25|$|The chapel lies in {{the north}} range of First Court, and its {{original}} construction dates to 1470-72. However, later renovation works meant that little of the original chapel other than the original roof remains. Since the college is dedicated to Mary Magdalene, much of the chapel's artwork describes her story. The glass windows on the eastern wall of the chapel are entirely dedicated to the encounters between Mary Magdalene and Jesus Christ {{around the time of}} the crucifixion of Jesus: anointing Jesus with her <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> ointment, watching the crucifixion, weeping at the tomb and recognising Jesus after his resurrection. Compared to most other Cambridge colleges of medieval origin, Magdalene College's chapel is much smaller and cosier, in line with the college's relatively small population.|$|E

25|$|Back in Britain, Collins met Austin John Marshall, {{whom she}} later married. She also {{proceeded}} with her singing career, appearing releasing on three compilations albums (A <b>Jug</b> <b>of</b> Punch, A Pinch of Salt and Rocket Along) in 1960 and an EP, Heroes in Love, in 1963 (now included with False True Lovers on the CD release). It was after that, {{in a series}} of influential albums, that she helped to introduce many innovations into the English folk revival. In 1964, she recorded the landmark jazz-folk fusion of Folk Roots, New Routes, with guitarist Davy Graham. 1967 saw the essentially southern English song collection, The Sweet Primeroses, on which she was accompanied for the first time by Dolly Collins's portative organ. 1968's The Power of the True Love Knot also featured Dolly's accompaniment. In 1969, there was another collaboration, this time with The Young Tradition (featuring Peter Bellamy, Heather Wood and Royston Wood) and Dolly Collins, The Holly Bears the Crown. However, the album was not released until 1995.|$|E
25|$|The four House dormitories have secret entrances, {{generally}} {{known only}} to members of that house and require a password (Gryffindor & Slytherin), riddle answer (Ravenclaw) or ritual (Hufflepuff) {{in order to gain}} entrance. Inside is the common room, which contains armchairs and sofas for the pupils and tables for studying and homework. There are fireplaces to keep the rooms warm, and students either relax here in the evenings or else complete their homework, but may complete their work in the bedroom. There are notice boards in each common room and at other strategic points throughout the school. The students sleep in their House dormitories, which branch off from the common rooms. Each dormitory gets at least two rooms; one for boys and one for girls (an enchantment prevents boys from entering the girls' area, although there is no spell to prevent the reverse from occurring). Each student sleeps in a large four-poster bed with bed covers and heavy curtains in the House colours, and thick white pillows. There is a bedside table for each bed, and each dormitory has a <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> water and goblets on a tray.|$|E

[...] "Looking back further it was where we all lived together in the early years, played all those flapper and <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> ale shows, and then got our record deal".

500|$|The {{head of the}} {{household}} takes a <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> wine and pours some on the badnjak; in some regions, he may strew wheat grains over the logs. He then proposes a toast: [...] "Grant, O God, that there be health and joy in this home, that our grain and grapevines yield well, that children be born healthy to us, that our property increase in the field, pen, and barn!" [...] or, [...] "Hail, badnjak, veseljak! I give you wheat and wine, and you give me every good thing and peace!" [...] or similar. The name veseljak, literally [...] "jovial one", is used along with badnjak in some areas. The head drinks a draught of wine from the jug, after which it is passed to other members of household. In the clan of Kuči, wine is poured on the [...] "beard" [...] of the badnjak, and then a little girl sits for a moment on the log—for the well-being of the cattle. Christmas Eve dinner follows, which traditionally includes a round loaf of unleavened bread, beans, fish, walnuts, honey, and red wine. The bread is not cut with a knife, but broken with hands.|$|E
500|$|On April 3, Presley {{made the}} first of two {{appearances}} on NBC's Milton Berle Show. His performance, {{on the deck of the}} USS Hancock in San Diego, prompted cheers and screams from an audience of sailors and their dates. A few days later, a flight taking Presley and his band to Nashville for a recording session left all three badly shaken when an engine died and the plane almost went down over Arkansas. Twelve weeks after its original release, [...] "Heartbreak Hotel" [...] became Presley's first number-one pop hit. In late April, Presley began a two-week residency at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino on the Las Vegas Strip. The shows were poorly received by the conservative, middle-aged hotel guests—"like a <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> corn liquor at a champagne party," [...] wrote a critic for Newsweek. Amid his Vegas tenure, Presley, who had serious acting ambitions, signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures. He began a tour of the Midwest in mid-May, taking in 15 cities in as many days. He had attended several shows by Freddie Bell and the Bellboys in Vegas and was struck by their cover of [...] "Hound Dog", a hit in 1953 for blues singer Big Mama Thornton by songwriters Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. It became the new closing number of his act. After a show in La Crosse, Wisconsin, an urgent message on the letterhead of the local Catholic diocese's newspaper was sent to FBI director J. Edgar Hoover. It warned that [...] "Presley is a definite danger to the security of the United States.... actions and motions were such as to rouse the sexual passions of teenaged youth.... After the show, more than 1,000 teenagers tried to gang into Presley's room at the auditorium.... Indications of the harm Presley did just in La Crosse were the two high school girls... whose abdomen and thigh had Presley's autograph." ...|$|E

2500|$|Perhaps {{the most}} popular Persian poet of the 19th and early 20th centuries was Omar Khayyam (1048–1123), whose Rubaiyat was freely {{translated}} by Edward Fitzgerald in 1859.

2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1942, P-47Cs {{were sent}} to England for combat operations. The initial Thunderbolt flyers, 56th Fighter Group, was sent {{overseas}} to join the 8th Air Force. As the P-47 Thunderbolt worked up to operational status, it gained a nickname: the [...] "Jug" [...] (because its profile {{was similar to that}} of a common milk <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> the time). Two Fighter Groups already stationing in England began introducing the Jugs in January 1943: the Spitfire-flying 4th Fighter Group, a unit built around a core of experienced American pilots who had flown in the RAF Eagle Squadrons prior to the US entry in the war; and the 78th Fighter Group, formerly flying P-38 Lightnings.|$|E
2500|$|Jieun {{returns to}} sing the second verse of the song with interchanging scenes from the {{abandoned}} building, the misty rice field {{and in the back}} seat of the car.

The video returns to the present where the woman has parked her car in a road near a rice field at night. When Jieun starts {{to sing the}} second chorus, the woman opens her car trunk in a straight-on view, revealing a captive man (Kim Him Chan) who had been blindfolded and tied up with rope. The woman takes a <b>jug</b> <b>of</b> gasoline in the trunk of her car and kisses the man. She then pours gasoline on the prisoner and backs up a distance from the car.
