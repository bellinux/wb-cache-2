Nomura started drawing {{at the age of}} three years and developed his own Sugoroku games during his elementary school years. As a child, he spent much of his free time playing baseball, swimming, fishing and building fortresses. When he was in middle school, his father told him that an era of computers would come and bought him his own computer. Nomura played Legends of Star Arthur: Planet Mephius on it and started creating his own video games by learning programming. He first tried a Nintendo product with the tennis and ping-pong variant of the Color TV Game console and later borrowed a Family Computer in high school. Around that time, Dragon Warrior became Nomura's favorite because it surprised him and introduced him to video games with story elements. His art teacher in high school pointed him towards the works of Final Fantasy illustrator Yoshitaka Amano. Nomura also created his own manga during class and intended to do this as a profession although he ultimately abandoned the idea. Nomura went to vocational school to learn magazine and advertising artwork. Nomura then looked for an advertising job at a publishing company. However, he eventually applied at the video game company Square after he had seen a <b>job</b> <b>advertisement</b> with a drawing by Yoshitaka Amano.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{marketization}} of universities’ recruitment discourse, using critical discourse analysis and corpus linguistic methodology. University and financial <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> were compared synchronically and diachronically. Synchronic corpus linguistic analyses were executed on 3, 000 online university and 3, 000 financial <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> {{from the present}} day. In addition, 60 university and financial <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> from newspaper in the 1970 s were analysed manually for the diachronic comparison. The results indicate that while 1970 s university and financial <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> are strikingly different, 2010 s university <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> are fundamentally aligned with those from businesses. 2010 s university <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> and financial <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> seek to establish the credentials of the employer but this move is rare in 1970 s university <b>job</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Universities in 2010 s are construed as performing activities that are inherently promotional. Applicants in 2010 s university <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> are construed as more equal and as benefiting from the job. The evaluative adjectives in university and financial <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> are largely similar. Business oriented discourse and ideologies have become conventionalized in the phraseology of university discourse. However, universities do not always adopt business discursive practices and should indeed be more selective about the in-take of business discourse. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose Gender fair {{language}} use in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> {{has been shown}} to impact the outcome of personnel selections. It is thus important to assess, to what extent gender fair language is used in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> and with which factors it is associated, e. g., language, culture, status, and gender typicality of profession. Design/Methodology In the present research we investigated gender fair {{language use}} in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> published online in four European countries with different socio-economic rankings of gender equality (World Economic Forum, 2011), namely Austria (rank 34), Czech Republic (75), Poland (42), and Switzerland (10). From four lines of business with different percentages of female employees – steels/metals, science, restaurants/food services, and health care –we randomly selected 100 <b>job</b> <b>advertisements,</b> summing up to 1600 <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> in total. Results A first analysis of the Swiss data indicates that the phrasing of <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> is closely related to a profession’s gender typicality (e. g., merely masculine forms are used in steels and metals, gender-fair forms in healthcare). Feminine forms however are almost never used. Cross-cultural comparisons will be presented. Limitations We analyzed <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> of four specific lines of business in four European countries. To what extend results can be generalized remains an open question. Research/Practical Implications The present data provide a sound basis for future studies on gender fair language use in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Furthermore it sheds a light on how companies comply with national guidelines of gender equality. Originality/Value This {{is the first time that}} gender fair language use in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> is investigated (a) across different countries and languages and (b) considering status and gender typicality of professions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the variety of}} languages {{and the level of}} language competence required in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> in Lithuania. The research is based on the data collected from on-line and hard-copy newspapers; <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> under investigation include those written in Lithuanian and other languages. The main findings suggest that in on-line advertisements employers require foreign language competence more often than those in the hard-copy adverts. It has also been observed that competence of two languages is of high demand. If employers require competence of 3 languages, the order of the languages is as follows: national (Lithuanian), lingua-franca (English), and others (Russian or Polish). Lithuanian is of high importance in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> as employers tend to take into consideration the level of written and spoken Lithuanian. Finally, the data have revealed that in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> language knowledge is described in very abstract terms, and references to the CEFR are hardly ever observed in the collected data...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to establish whether employers specify the requirement of CPD when recruiting managers and, in doing so, to open up the debate on the importance attached to CPD by employers. Design/methodology/approach – An observational analysis was undertaken of <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> placed in four regional newspapers and a national online job web site over a two-month period (August and September 2006). Findings – From the newspaper <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> scrutinized none indicated CPD either directly or indirectly as a requirement for managerial jobs. Job experience (84 per cent) and personal attributes (82 per cent) were the most important requirements indicated for managerial jobs. An online national jobs web site, however, implied or specifically mentioned CPD for only five managerial posts. Research limitations/implications – Some of the <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> provided very scant details. The study has only taken a surface view of the posts, as opposed to a detailed reviewing of the person specification for jobs. Targeting “Managers” focused on only middle level positions and even this could have excluded some posts. Practical implications – The lack of CPD evidence now challenges employers to consider the importance of CPD when preparing managerial <b>job</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Originality/value – The paper highlights the gap between the value of CPD and its absence in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> and discusses the impact of the findings on relevant stakeholder groups. It argues the need for employers to detail CPD implicitly or explicitly in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> to enhance the quality of job applicants...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that gender {{references}} in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> {{play an important role}} for gender (in) equality in personnel selection. The use of pair forms (masculine and feminine form) in German-language <b>job</b> <b>advertisements,</b> for example, was found to reduce the lack of fit between women and leadership roles (Horvath & Sczesny, 2013). Therefore the present study addresses the question which forms of gender reference are used in <b>job</b> <b>advertisements,</b> how these forms are distributed in different countries and how language use is related to gender typicality and status of the job. We collected <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> published online in four countries with different rankings of gender equality (i. e., Switzerland, Austria, Poland, and Czech Republic; World Economic Forum, 2011). We randomly selected 100 advertisements per country from four branches that are characterized by different proportions of female and male employees: steels/metals, science, restaurants/food services, and health care. The advertisements were analyzed with regard to gender references as well as different indicators of job status. The results show that, in general, men and women are addressed more equally in Swiss and Austrian <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> compared to Polish and Czech <b>job</b> <b>advertisements.</b> The results also show that women and men are addressed more equally in branches where the proportion of women is high than where the proportion of women is low. We thus can conclude that the use of gender references is associated with the degree of gender equality achieved in a country and with the gender typicality of a profession...|$|R

In all there were 68 appointments during the research period, 40 before the economic collapse and 28 after the collapse, which met the criteria of 13 th paragraph in 22 nd article of employment laws, no. 70 / 1996. Content analysis, which is a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, was used for processing and analyzing the data. The study investigates whether the <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> fulfill the criteria about job advertisments like they appear in regulations no. 464 / 1996 about <b>job</b> <b>advertisements.</b> Whether <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> for vacant <b>jobs</b> were published in Lögbirtingablaðið (Iceland’s Legal Publication Journal), whether the application deadline were according to 7 th article og the employment laws, whether special recruiting committees were used for professional support and finally the length of the recruitment process.

40|$|This article uses data {{obtained}} from a content analysis of <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> to explore the questions of (1) what types of non-traditional jobs are available for library and information science (LIS) professionals and (2) how can LIS students and professionals take advantage of non-traditional job opportunities. Two groups of <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> were used in this investigation: <b>advertisements</b> from LIS-targeted <b>job</b> boards (two library school job boards and two library association job boards) and Government of Canada internal job postings. These two sets of job postings were selected to compare the competencies in job postings targeted to LIS graduates (the LIS <b>job</b> board <b>advertisements)</b> and <b>job</b> postings that were not targeted to the LIS community (the Government of Canada <b>job</b> <b>advertisements).</b> An analysis of these groups of <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> demonstrated that both samples focused mainly on transferable competencies. Due to the emphasis on transferable competencies, the analysis of job postings from the Government of Canada job list revealed {{that there are many}} non-traditional opportunities for LIS graduates. A typical LIS professional could apply for 51 (or 25. 8 %) of the <b>job</b> <b>advertisements</b> in this set, having met all of the listed criteria. This individual may be able to apply for an additional 40 (or 21. 2 %) of the jobs listed if they had certain additional competencies or knowledge obtained through prior experience working in the Government of Canada but not necessarily obtained by the average LIS professional. This supports the argument that there are numerous opportunities for LIS professionals in non-traditional jobs. The exploration of commonly requested competencies can be used to guide LIS job seekers to craft their resumes and CVs to address the competencies requested by potential employers.
