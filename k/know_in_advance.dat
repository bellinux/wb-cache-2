5|$|The Buccaneers {{were once}} again criticized for poor {{tackling}} and conservative play-calling following a loss to a previously winless St. Louis Cardinals team. This time, complaints came from the players as the Cardinals seemed to <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> which plays the Buccaneers would be running, and the Buccaneers waited until {{too late in the}} game to make adjustments. The Buccaneers led early, after Steve DeBerg's touchdown pass to Calvin Magee on a fake field goal. Steve Young's rushing and passing combined for 304 of the Buccaneers' 347 yards. The Cardinals unexpectedly used a soft zone defense instead of their usual blitzing, which contributed to Tampa Bay's decision to avoid the passing game until the fourth quarter. The Cardinals put the game away with Stump Mitchell's 31-yard fourth-quarter touchdown run, in which three Buccaneers missed tackles. Ron Holmes, Jeremiah Castille, Marvin Powell, and Gerald Carter all missed the game with injuries.|$|E

25|$|The {{accuracy}} of the Mishnah's claim that the Mishnaic calendar was also used in the late Second Temple period is less certain. One scholar has noted {{that there are no}} laws from Second Temple period sources that indicate any doubts about the length of a month or of a year. This led him to propose that the priests must have had some form of computed calendar or calendrical rules that allowed them to <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> whether a month would have 30 or 29 days, and whether a year would have 12 or 13 months.|$|E
25|$|The wolf plays a {{prominent}} role in the Serer religion's creation myth, where it is viewed as the first living creature created by Roog, the Supreme God and Creator. In one aspect, it can be viewed as an Earth-diver sent to Earth by Roog, in another, as a fallen prophet for disobeying the laws of the divine. The wolf was the first intelligent creature on earth, and it is believed that it will remain on earth after human beings have returned to the divine. The Serers believe that, not only does it <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> who will die, but it traces the tracks in advance of those who will go to funerals. The movements of the wolf are carefully observed, because the animal is viewed as a seer who came from the transcendence and maintains links with it. Although believed to be rejected in the bush by other animals and deprived of its original intelligence, it is still respected because it dared to resist the supreme being who still keeps it alive.|$|E

25|$|Imagine {{a pair of}} {{particles}} that can be measured at distant locations. Suppose that the measurement devices have settings, which are angles—e.g., the devices measure something called spin in some direction. The experimenter chooses the directions, one for each particle, separately. Suppose the measurement outcome is binary (e.g., spin up, spin down). Suppose the two particles are perfectly anti-correlated—in the sense that whenever both measured in the same direction, one gets identically opposite outcomes, when both measured in opposite directions they always give the same outcome. The only way to imagine how this works is that both particles leave their common source with, somehow, the outcomes they will deliver when measured in any possible direction. (How else could particle 1 know how to deliver the same answer as particle 2 when measured in the same direction? They don't <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> how {{they are going to}} be measured...). The measurement on particle 2 (after switching its sign) can be thought of as telling us what the same measurement on particle 1 would have given.|$|E

500|$|In October 2009, actress Barbara Windsor's {{decision}} to leave EastEnders after sixteen years of portraying the character Peggy Mitchell was announced. The show's executive producer, Bryan Kirkwood, {{said it was a}} massive honour for him to be responsible for the character's exit, but explained that as she has become the [...] "quintessential matriarch of the show", they had to get the exit storyline right, which he said would be [...] "both epic and poignant". Windsor gave one year's notice of leaving, giving the production team time {{to come up with a}} storyline, and was asked to keep her decision a secret until the announcement was made. Kirkwood looked at Windsor's first episode and decided her exit should be about Peggy and her son Phil, as Peggy's arrival came at a time when Phil needed her most, and since then, she had believed that Phil still needed her. Peggy's exit came when she realised his mother was not what Phil needed. Windsor did not want to <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> how her character would leave, but hoped she would not be killed off. She commented: [...] "My exit was beautifully written and I really couldn’t have asked for a better send-off for Peggy." ...|$|E
500|$|The title {{received}} generally negative reviews. Video game magazines Nintendo Power and Electronic Gaming Monthly {{gave the}} title {{a score of}} 2.68 out of 5 and 5.62 out of 10 respectively, while the website Allgame rated it 3 out of 5 stars. Freelance critic Robert Schmitz gave the title a score of 0.5 out of 11, calling it [...] "awful" [...] and explaining the game is almost [...] "better left unsaid." [...] Schmitz blamed Enix's decision to base the game on a little-known cartoon series, a comment echoed by both the Video Game Bible. Electronic Gaming Monthly felt the graphics lack vibrant colors, but that the music was [...] "alright." [...] Allan Milligan, in a review for the Gaming Intelligence Agency, judged the graphics and audio both mediocre, the character designs [...] "terrible," [...] the plot generic and the puzzles not challenging. He noted {{that it is impossible}} for the player to <b>know</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> which Knight is best suited for which boss. Milligan called the game [...] "staggeringly ill-conceived" [...] and likened it to a [...] "succession of fetch quests." [...] He criticized the fact that all enemies on a screen must be defeated to progress through some passages, and the possibility for characters and enemies to be hidden from the player's view behind large objects. The Knights' artificial intelligence was also denounced, as was the lack of animation when a character or enemy is hit.|$|E

40|$|The dynamic {{approximate}} membership problem asks {{to represent}} a set S of size n, whose elements are provided in an on-line fashion, supporting membership queries without false negatives and with a false positive rate at most epsilon. That is, the membership algorithm must be correct on each x in S, and may err with probability at most epsilon on each x not in S. We study a well-motivated, yet insufficiently explored, variant of this problem where the size n of the set is not <b>known</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> Existing optimal approximate membership data structures require that the size is <b>known</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> but <b>in</b> many practical scenarios {{this is not a}} realistic assumption. Moreover, even if the eventual size n of the set is <b>known</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> it is desirable to have the smallest possible space usage also when the current number of inserted elements is smaller than n. Our contribution consists of the following results: - We show a super-linear gap between the space complexity when the size is <b>known</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> and the space complexity when the size is not <b>known</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance.</b> - We show that our space lower bound is tight, and can even be matched by a highly efficient data structure.
