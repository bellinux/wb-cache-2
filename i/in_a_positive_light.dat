5|$|All {{publications}} and media {{were subjected to}} censorship. The Soviets sought to recruit Polish left-wing intellectuals {{who were willing to}} cooperate. Soon after the Soviet invasion, the Writers' Association of Soviet Ukraine created a local chapter in Lwów; there was a Polish-language theater and radio station. Polish cultural activities in Minsk and Wilno were less organized. These activities were strictly controlled by the Soviet authorities, which saw to it that these activities portrayed the new Soviet regime <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>light</b> and vilified the former Polish government.|$|E
5|$|Two Timmy and Lassie episodes {{launched}} Campbell's Soup premiums, {{while two}} others promoted a UNICEF Halloween {{project and the}} Peace Patrol, a children's savings bond program spearheaded by Lassie and The Lone Ranger.

5|$|At over 80, Mondragón {{was still}} able to mount on horseback, though he had to be helped by two men and could only wear light armour. He first came to {{prominence}} at the Battle of Mühlberg, in 1547, {{and was one of the}} few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces, being portrayed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>light</b> by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo. Mondragón could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E
5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>light.</b> She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her time and money to helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to these}} delays, Urobuchi issued an apology to viewers. However, he also {{indicated}} that the postponements could be viewed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>light</b> because they alleviated some production pressures placed on animation studio Shaft due to the tight broadcast schedule. Citing particularly challenging drawings for episodes 11 and 12, Urobuchi and Iwakami planned to have Shaft continue to improve the episodes immediately up until their new air time. Furthermore, Urobuchi remarked that if episode 11 in its current state had been aired as scheduled, the result most likely would have been disappointing. On March 23, 2011, the broadcast {{for the rest of}} the series was delayed indefinitely. However, the production team reported that they were continuing to work on the episodes and announced their intention to finish airing the series by April. Finally, on April 10, 2011, the official website for Puella Magi Madoka Magica announced that broadcasts would resume on April 21. Episodes 11 and 12 aired back-to-back on MBS to conclude the series, while TBS and CBC ran episode 10 in addition to 11 and 12.|$|E

5|$|The {{tendency}} to portray animals as having human traits was not new; Aesop's moralistic animal tales were still popular with {{readers of the}} day, and inspired such works as Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book (1894). However, one of the features separating the turn-of-the-century animal writers from those before them was the desire to have their animals set an example through their noble, sympathetic characteristics. Anna Sewell's Black Beauty, for example, {{told the story of}} a gentle horse seemingly from the animal's own point of view; after being published in the United States by the American Humane Education Society in 1890, Sewell's book helped further the cause against animal cruelty. The budding animal welfare movement helped establish a climate for wider public support of wildlife conservation, and soon nature writers similarly sought to gain sympathy for wild animals—specifically those who seemingly displayed honorable human traits—by depicting them <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>light.</b> One popular nature writer of the day, Mabel Osgood Wright, told of wolves nobly taking their own lives after losing their mates.|$|E

25|$|In his {{criticism}} of Gnosticism, Irenaeus made reference to a Gnostic gospel which portrayed Judas <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> <b>light,</b> as having acted in accordance with Jesus' instructions.

25|$|Abiding by {{traditions and}} {{cultural}} norms {{is a more}} popular reason for not smoking than that of health related concerns, religion, personal conviction, or economic reasons.
