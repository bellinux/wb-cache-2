40|$|Carbon Fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (CFRP) composites are recently {{becoming an}} efficacious solution in rehabilitation and strengthening work for deteriorated reinforced concrete structures, {{because of their}} superior properties. It is important to maintain a sound interaction between CFRP and concrete for transferring stresses between concrete substrate and the CFRP <b>sheet</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate.</b> However, the epoxy adhesive used to create the bond is very sensitive to the temperature and mechanical properties deteriorate rapidly with exposure to the elevated temperature. The CFRP <b>sheet</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate</b> itself cannot provide sufficient insulation to the composite system. Therefore, application of a suitable insulation onto the CFRP sheet is important especially {{in the application of}} buildings. Initially, a numerical model was developed to determine the behaviour of an insulated CFRP strengthened concrete block. The model predicted results were well agreed with the test results. Then the model was further developed to understand the behaviour of a CFRP strengthened concrete slab subjected to fire.

50|$|Two {{techniques}} are typically adopted for {{the strengthening of}} beams, relating to the strength enhancement desired: flexural strengthening or shear strengthening. In many cases {{it may be necessary}} to provide both strength enhancements. For the flexural strengthening of a beam, FRP <b>sheets</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates</b> are applied to the tension face of the member (the bottom face for a simply supported member with applied top loading or gravity loading). Principal tensile fibres are oriented in the beam longitudinal axis, similar to its internal flexural steel reinforcement. This increases the beam strength and its stiffness (load required to cause unit deflection), however decreases the deflection capacity and ductility.|$|R

50|$|Flat rolling is {{the most}} basic form of rolling with the {{starting}} and ending material having a rectangular cross-section. The material is fed in between two rollers, called working rolls, that rotate in opposite directions. The {{gap between the two}} rolls is less than the thickness of the starting material, which causes it to deform. The decrease in material thickness causes the material to elongate. The friction at the interface between the material and the rolls causes the material to be pushed through. The amount of deformation possible in a single pass is limited by the friction between the rolls; if the change in thickness is too great the rolls just slip over the material and do not draw it in. The final product is either <b>sheet</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate,</b> with the former being less than 6 mm thick and the latter greater than; however, heavy plates tend to be formed using a press, which is termed forming, rather than rolling.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Cropping is {{a cutting}} process whereby {{opposing}} aligned blades create a shearing failure by exerting opposing forces normal to {{the surfaces of}} a metal <b>sheet</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate.</b> Building on recent efforts to quantify cropping, this paper formulates a plane strain elastic-plastic model of a plate subject to shearing action by opposing rigid platens. Shear failure {{at the local level}} is modeled by a cohesive zone characterized by the peak shear traction and the energy dissipated by shear failure process at the microscopic level. The model reveals the interplay between shear cracking and the extensive plastic shearing accompanying the cutting process. Specifically, it provides insight into the influence of the material’s microscopic shear strength and toughness on the total work of cropping. The computational model does not account for deformation of the cropping tool, friction between sliding surfaces and material temperature and rate-dependence.

40|$|In the {{industrial}} forming of metal <b>sheet</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate</b> components {{by means of}} a bending operation, a constant problem is the change of shape, or “springback”, of the formed part under the elastic stresses that are released when the forming pressure is removed. For the close-tolerance forming of such components, an accurate means of calculating the springback is of great value, as this enables a corrective allowance to be made when designing and performing the forming operation itself. In the present paper, the influence of axial force on the elastic-plastic bending and springback of a beam is examined. After obtaining the fundamental relationship between the curvature of the beam and the load for the case of pure bending, both the elastic-plastic bending of a cantilever subjected to a concentrated force at its tip and the springback are considered. It is shown that the analysis {{can be applied to the}} press-brake bending of strips and the equibiaxial bending of plate...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of externally bonded fiber-reinforced polymer (FRP) laminates for strengthening existing reinforced concrete (RC) structures is strictly {{related to the}} bond of the FRP reinforcement to the concrete substrate.

Thus, a series of single shear tests (SSTs) under both monotonic and cyclic actions, without inversion of sign, were performed on concrete prismatic specimens reinforced with carbon FRP (CFRP) <b>sheets</b> <b>or</b> <b>plates.</b> To evaluate and compare the influence of cyclic external actions on the bonding behavior of sheets and plate reinforcements, the results provided by monotonic and cyclic tests are reported and discussed in this paper.

The result of this is cut edges at an angle other than 90 Degrees to the material surface, for example 30-45 Degree angles. This angle is continuous throughout the thickness of the material. This is typically applied in situations where the profile being cut is to be used as part of a welded fabrication as the angled edge forms part of the weld preparation. When the weld preparation is applied during the cnc plasma cutting process, secondary operations such as grinding or machining can be avoided, reducing cost.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} evaluation of texture via ultrasonic measurements because of the advantages when compared to evaluation by diffraction techniques. First, ultrasonic measurements are much more rapid and have the potential of being used concurrently while processing. Second, ultrasonic measurements are nondestructive while diffraction techniques require coupons to be cut for samples. Third, ultrasonic measurements, like neutron diffraction, sample the bulk of the test material while, in contrast, x-ray diffraction samples a thin surface layer. The primary disadvantage of ultrasonic measurements is that the textural evaluation must be based on a quite limited amount of data whereas diffraction evaluation is normally based upon a very extensive number of measured points. In spite of this disadvantage, research has shown that ultrasonic measurements are potentially useful. Specifically, it has been established [1, 2] that during ultrasonic measurements the textural contribution can be distinguished from stress contribution, and it has been shown [3 – 10] that ultrasonic measurements do give a measure of the type and amount of texture in metal <b>sheet</b> <b>or</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R
