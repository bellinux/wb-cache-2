5|$|I {{was just}} trying to make a point. I wanted to show people {{how easy it is to}} {{manipulate}} someone's voice. If I can do it with a clip I pulled off of TV, imagine what they are doing on records and during live performances. The entire industry has been so manipulated, because there's such an emphasis on perfection, so when something like this happens, it causes such a stir. I knew something had to have happened to make it jump so fast. It's wild how much the story's been twisted. It's just always been fun for me to manipulate artists, and make it sound crazy. It was just for a good laugh. It was a goof, just for fun. I do a lot of parodies on my YouTube channel, and it <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> this one got a little out of hand. It was just what I've learned in school, and it's fun I could fool so many people and get away with it. A lot of people had a lot of laughs because of it, so why should I apologize? If you can't poke fun at yourself, I don't know what kind of person you are.|$|E
25|$|On one stormy night, the landlord, Huang Shiren, {{and several}} of his other {{servants}} come to the temple to worship and provide offerings. Their trip is stopped by the thunderstorm. It <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> that Xi'er is now in the temple too, and by the light of a flash of lightning, the landlord sees her—with her long white hair and shabby clothes that have been weathered to nearly white. He thinks it is the reincarnation of a goddess who has come to punish him for his mistreatment of Xi'er and other despotisms. He is so frightened that he is literally paralyzed. Xi'er recognizes that it is her arch-enemy and seizes the opportunity to take further revenge. She picks up the brass incense burner and hurls it against the landlord. The landlord and his gang flee.|$|E

500|$|The song divided music critics. Sasha Geffen {{from the}} Chicago Reader gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} track, complimenting it for bringing the underground PC Music to the mainstream, adding that [...] "between Diplo's blocky breakdowns and Sophie's slippery arpeggios, s a provocative piece of work [...] The shift from SoundCloud to superstars was always coming—it <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> that Madonna {{is the one who}} carried it over." [...] Another positive review came from [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, who elaborated: [...] "he track in question fizzes with bright energy, a handclapping rave anthem powered by a fantastically wonky synth line that sounds like a vintage arcade game played on an electronic kazoo, and topped off with a snappy Nicki Minaj rap. Madonna delivers the melody like a playground nursery rhyme, chanting about bad behavior in a butter-wouldn't-melt sing-song voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Burnley is {{the primary}} {{songwriter}} in the band. Music industry attorney and author Martin Frascogna writes that [...] "it's unmistakably clear that Burnley started the group, is the creative force behind the group and essentially dictates the group's decisions." [...] Bands such as Nirvana, Live, Bush, Pearl Jam, Stone Temple Pilots, and The Beatles have been cited as influences. Burnley remarked in 2009 that while the other band members did contribute, it was [...] "always left {{up to me to}} put all the pieces together and make it so that it's even anything at all." [...] However, Burnley expressed how he considered Rauch to be his [...] "writing partner" [...] during Dear Agony, and that he looked forward to writing with him in the future. After joining the band in 2014 as part of the new lineup, Rauch provided writing contributions on Dark Before Dawn, writing the intro and outro tracks as well as riffs on two other tracks. Burnley revealed in 2015 that the whole band would write songs for Breaking Benjamin in the future, and that [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> that when they came on board for this album, I was already 95 percent done", adding, [...] "I'm really looking forward to writing the next one all together." ...|$|E

[...] gained {{even more}} fame in Brazil when Miranda {{performed}} {{it in the}} 1939 film Banana da Terra, {{and it was this}} song that garnered her international attention and helped launch her career. After this success, Caymmi began to focus more on making music, and he wrote songs that appeared in other Brazilian films.

2500|$|The story follows Sakura, a 14-year-old princess who'd rather marry {{for love}} and make her own choices in life than be married away to someone she's never met. Her best friend is Asagiri, a cute female Mononoke (a tiny spirit) who she once saved from a life of slavery (unbeknownst to her, Asagiri is really a Yuki-Onna). Since birth, she's been engaged to Prince Oura. Not wanting to marry the prince after a {{precarious}} argument with Prince Oura's messenger, named Aoba, Sakura runs away but gets lost and accidentally looks at the full moon, which she was warned to never do. A man-eating demon arrives, referring to Sakura as [...] "Princess Kaguya" [...] and nearly wounds her, but Aoba and a priestess that Sakura knows named Byakuya arrive. Priestess Byakuya tells Sakura that she is in fact Princess Kaguya's granddaughter {{and is the only}} one able to destroy the demons. By drawing a pair of back-to-back crescent moons on her palm, she is able to summon the mystic sword Chizakura and kill the demon. She also discovers the word “destroy” is actually her Soul Symbol (a symbol each person possesses that best represents his or her true nature). Soon after, Sakura, Asagiri, and Aoba travel to Prince Oura's estate, where it's discovered that Aoba actually is Prince Oura, explaining {{that he wanted to be}} mischievous. Of course, the two don't get along from then on, until finally while relaxing under a tree, the two finally seem to come to an understanding, and do appear to be finding the silver lining in their arranged engagement. Unfortunately, she is soon under threat of execution, as Aoba turns on her, as he's afraid that she will eventually become a demon herself, like her mother and grandmother before her. Aoba shoots an arrow through her chest and Sakura falls into a river, only to be found by a cute and sassy young ninja named Kohaku and her childhood friend Hayate, who used to be human but was accidentally turned into a frog by Kohaku (although he regains his human form during the full moon). While with Kohaku, the two form a nice friendship, and Sakura reveals that she is being hunted by Kohaku's master, who <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> to be Aoba. Kohaku though in return admits already knowing this, and tells that she doesn't wish to harm her, and wants to protect her. The two, along with Asagiri and Hayate, soon encounter Aoba and his men, and Volume 1 ends with Sakura being affected by a youko whistle that Aoba has.|$|E
2500|$|Taki {{has also}} been {{repeatedly}} listed as one of gaming's top ninja characters, such as by Kotaku Japan in 2013. According to Kotaku USA's Schedeen, [...] "Everyone loves a good ninja, and Taki <b>just</b> <b>so</b> <b>happens</b> {{to be one of}} the best;" [...] in 2007, Joystiq's JC Fletcher called her [...] "everyone's favorite underdressed ninja."

In 2010, Game Informer chose Taki as one of the 20 Namco characters they would like to see in a rumored crossover fighting game [...] "Namco Vs Capcom", her Capcom side equivalent being Strider Hiryu, adding that [...] "most fighting game characters can’t quite keep up with Taki’s rapid (and annoying) leaps."

In 2012, Rich Knight of Complex ranked her as the fifth swiftest video game ninja, adding that, due to her large bust size, [...] "the only female on this list is also probably the most incredible ninja on here." [...] In 2013, PLAY similarly ranked Taki as the fifth top ninja in video games, described as [...] "superagile fighting machine" [...] and noted as the only female on their list, adding that she [...] "wins the Most Outrageous Ninja Outfit award for garbing herself in nothing but a pink skintight bodysuit." [...] Márcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's GameHall placed her at fifth spot of his 2014 list of top ten kunoichi (female ninja) characters in games. It is also possible Taki inspired the design of Crimson Akali, an alternate version of the League of Legends character Akali the Fist of Shadow.|$|E
