25|$|In Australia's 1999 tour of Sri Lanka, he was {{involved}} in a sickening outfield collision when both he and Steve Waugh were running to take a catch. Waugh was running from the infield towards the outfield, while Gillespie was running in. Waugh dived for the ball resulting <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and Gillespie's right leg being broken. The catch was not taken.|$|E
25|$|Cassidy {{administered}} {{an overdose}} of ether, which caused Dillinger to suffocate. He began to turn blue and stopped breathing. Loeser pulled Dillinger's tongue {{out of his mouth}} with a pair of forceps, {{and at the same time}} forcing both elbows into his ribs. Dillinger gasped and resumed breathing. The procedure continued with only a local anaesthetic. Loeser removed several moles on Dillinger's forehead, made an incision <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and an incision in his chin and tied back both cheeks.|$|E
25|$|Carleton S. Coon {{also has}} a {{hypothesis}} for why noses on Mongoloids are very distinct. Typically, the nose is not very prominent {{on the face of}} a Mongoloid. Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow more room for padding to protect from their cold environment. Regardless of the environment that the mongoloid is <b>in,</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> helps reduce the stress of the environment on their body by moistening the air inspired to cool the body off instead of doing a straight up heat exchange.|$|E
50|$|In February 2005, Reedus {{sustained}} {{a head injury}} when a truck collided with <b>his</b> car <b>in</b> Germany. <b>His</b> <b>nose</b> was reconstructed {{with the aid of}} four screws and his left eye socket with titanium.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Simpkins rose. He was a short, round-shouldered man, made still shorter by {{the bend}} {{which he had}} {{acquired}} by the operation of boot-closing; his eyes were small, and sunken <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head; <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> wide and flat, as if <b>in</b> <b>his</b> early youth he had fallen {{on the edge of}} a pewter pot, and he too had the appearance of regarding water with as deep an aversion as he viewed the aristocracy.|$|R

25|$|Within the series' narrative, K9 is a robot dog {{acquired}} by Doctor Whos title {{character in the}} 1977 serial The Invisible Enemy. The first two incarnations of the character travelled alongside the fourth Doctor (portrayed by Tom Baker) until 1981. In these stories, K9 proved useful for the powerful laser weapon concealed <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose,</b> his encyclopaedic knowledge and his vast computer intelligence. By 1981, {{each of the two}} models of K9 which travelled alongside the Doctor had been left with one of the Doctor's female companions. The character subsequently transitioned into spin-off territory. Producers hoped K9's popularity with children would launch the series K9 and Company, led by actress Elisabeth Sladen in the role of companion Sarah Jane Smith alongside a new K9. In 2006, K9 reappeared in the revived series of Doctor Who. Although the character's appearances in the 2007 spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures were hampered by the concurrent development of the K9 spin-off, the character began to appear full-time in both K9 and The Sarah Jane Adventures, depicting adventures of the original K9 Mark I and of Mark IV, respectively.|$|E
500|$|During the Australian team's tour of England in 1899, Hill {{required}} {{surgery to}} remove a growth <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> [...] The after-effects of the operation were more serious than expected; Hill lost an alarming amount of weight and strength and missed around half of the tour. Before this, Hill was recognised by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as {{the best of the}} Australian batsmen that English summer. He scored 301runs in three Tests at an average of 60.20, and was named as one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year. His best performance of the series was in the Second Test at Lord's. [...] Hill scored 135, sharing a partnership of 82 with Victor Trumper, who was playing only his second Test match. [...] Trumper went on to score 135notout. [...] Hill, who was dropped by Ranjitsinhji fielding at slip when he had made 119, batted for 4hours and hit 17boundaries. Australia won the Test, the only one to have a definite result, by 10wickets and retained the Ashes.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2001–02 season, he had an {{unsuccessful}} trial with Cambridge United. He was then set to sign for Northampton Town, however, Kevin Wilson was sacked and the club's plans to sign the defender were halted. Stuart eventually joined Bury in October 2001 on a short-term contract, which was later extended to a two-and-a-half-year deal in February 2002. He made his debut for the club in the 1–0 away win at Hartlepool United in the Football League Trophy on 16 October 2001. He was sent-off in his third game for Bury in the 5–1 defeat to Brentford. Stuart scored his only goal for Bury on 22 December 2001, in the 1–1 draw at home to Blackpool. Bury went 1–0 down in the first-half, before Stuart equalised in the 53rd minute, with a shot that went in off the post. During his 18-month spell with Bury, Stuart was a first-team regular, making 61 appearances in the Third Division, scoring once. Bury finished seventh in the league during the 2002–03 season, qualifying for the play-offs. He also gained a total of four red cards and four yellows in the 18-months he was with Bury, including a red card in the 2002–03 play-off semi-final first leg against Bournemouth. Stuart was allegedly elbowed in the face by Wade Elliott, which resulted <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> being broken and Stuart reacting by grabbing Elliott's shirt. Referee, Jeff Winter, adjudged Stuart had thrown a punch, whilst Andy Preece criticised Stuart for raising his arms to another player, defended him saying [...] "I can't see why he thinks Jamie has punched him in the face...the explanation from the ref doesn't add up with what you see on the video." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{brooding}} Lammle, {{with certain}} white dints {{coming and going}} <b>in</b> <b>his</b> palpitating <b>nose,</b> looked as if some tormenting imp were pinching it.

A petition seeking redress for his death garners over 15,000 signatures. Qin's wife and daughter are subsequently imprisoned and reportedly tortured for their efforts to draw attention to the case.|$|E
2500|$|Groucho {{maintained}} his irrepressible {{sense of humor}} to the very end, however. [...] George Fenneman, his radio and TV announcer, good-natured foil, and lifelong friend, often related a story {{of one of his}} final visits to Groucho's home: When the time came to end the visit, Fenneman lifted Groucho from his wheelchair, put his arms around his torso, and began to [...] "walk" [...] the frail comedian backwards across the room towards his bed. As he did, he heard a weak voice in his ear: [...] "Fenneman," [...] whispered Groucho, [...] "you always were a lousy dancer." [...] When a nurse approached him with a thermometer during his final hospitalization, explaining that she wanted to see if he had a temperature, he responded, [...] "Don't be silly—everybody has a temperature." [...] Actor Elliott Gould recalled a similar incident: [...] "I recall the last time I saw Groucho, he was in the hospital, and he had tubes <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> and what have you," [...] he said. [...] "And when he saw me, he was weak, but he was there; and he put his fingers on the tubes and played them like it was a clarinet. Groucho played the tubes for me, which brings me to tears." ...|$|E
2500|$|When allowed {{outside its}} pen, the bull {{typically}} {{was kept in}} a halter connected by a strap snapped into the ring <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> for ease of control. In the bull pen, {{the use of a}} ring connected by a cable to a fixed point was recommended as a means of controlling and securing the bull while allowing a degree of movement by the subject bull. [...] If the pen was strong enough, the bull could be turned loose, and if needed, placed in a stanchion. Farmers who lacked an assistant, or a bull staff, {{had no choice but to}} adopt other means. [...] Some farmers elected to move their bulls by tying a rope to the ring and tying the other end of the rope to a farm tractor, providing both motive power and a degree of protection from the angry bull. [...] The efficacy of this technique is doubtful, and may depend on the size of the tractor and of the bull; one authority has [...] "seen a bull lift the front end of a tractor like a toy". [...] Others used dogs and horses. [...] Not all farmers could afford specially designed and manufactured bull handling products, which were not readily available until the 1980s. [...] The experimental improvisation of techniques for bull handling, as in many aspects of family farming, was a common practice.|$|E

2500|$|Generally {{the use of}} both a {{ring and}} a halter, and {{management}} of the bull by two people, is the preferred method today for controlling the bull. [...] Typically, a bull was led by a wooden staff with a steel end that snapped into the ring. A long rigid steel or wooden bull staff locked into the ring could also be used to push a bull out of a pen without requiring the handler to enter the pen for cleaning or feeding. Because of the risk that the bull may drive the staff into the handler if the bull misbehaves many handlers prefer to avoid their use nowadays. [...] One current veterinary text still recommends the use of a staff in addition to the halter: Many handlers rely on a nose ring to control a bull. [...] But a ring <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> is no good unless you have a bull staff and use it. [...] A bull staff is a pole with a snap in the end that clips to the bull ring. [...] Leading a bull with a staff gives you a lot more handling power as the bull can't get any closer to you than the length of the staff allows. Leading him only by a chain in the ring lets him run over you at will.|$|E

60|$|The old sailor's {{face was}} brown as a berry.

60|$|Hidden in {{a little}} thicket, {{stretched}} out {{so that he might}} rest better, Old Man Coyote listened to that great voice drawing nearer and nearer. There was a wicked grin on Old Man Coyote's face, and <b>in</b> <b>his</b> yellow eyes a look of great eagerness. In a few minutes Bowser came <b>in</b> sight, <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> <b>in</b> the trail Old Man Coyote had left. Into Bowser's voice crept a new note of eagerness as <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> picked up the scent stronger than ever. Straight on he raced and it seemed as if he had gained new strength. His whole thought was on just one thing--catching Old Man Coyote, and Old Man Coyote knew it.|$|R

(It is speculated that his brother's punch during their sister's funeral may have played a role <b>in</b> shaping <b>his</b> <b>nose.)</b> He was also said to have had long and {{skillful}} fingers.
