5|$|With {{the advent}} of the Balkan Wars, Prince Andrew was {{reinstated}} in the army and Princess Andrew acted as a nurse, assisting at operations and setting up field hospitals, work for which King George V awarded her the Royal Red Cross in 1913. During World War I, <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> King Constantine of Greece, followed a neutrality policy despite the democratically elected government of Venizelos supporting the Allies. Princess Andrew and her children were forced to shelter in the palace cellars during the French bombardment of Athens on 1 December 1916. By June 1917, the King's neutrality policy had become so untenable that she {{and other members of the}} Greek royal family were forced into exile when <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> abdicated. For the next few years, most of the Greek royal family lived in Switzerland.|$|E

Their appeals were dismissed, as was a direct appeal to the White House. Through the efforts of US Ambassador Frederick Nolting, the assault charges laid against the journalists were subsequently dropped. Vietnamese Buddhists reacted to the incident by contending that Diệm's men were planning to assassinate monks, while Madame Nhu repeated earlier claims that the US government had been trying to overthrow <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law.</b>|$|E

Constance succeeded her father, who fell in battle, at the age of two, {{although}} his cousin, Roger II of Sicily, laid claim to Antioch. Her mother assumed the regency, but the Antiochene noblemen replaced her with her father (Constance's grandfather), Baldwin II of Jerusalem.

5|$|Anne Hyde (12 March 163731 March 1671) was Duchess of York and of Albany as {{the first}} wife of the future King James II of England. Originally an Anglican, she {{converted}} to Catholicism soon after her marriage to James. This took place in 1660 after she became pregnant by him, but {{he is said to}} have promised to marry her the year before. The two first met in the Netherlands while Anne was living in the household of James' sister Mary. James and Anne had eight children, but six died in early childhood.

5|$|Babe's storylines {{have mostly}} {{revolved}} around {{her relationship with}} the Carter family, most notably the delicate relationship with her sister Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) and the unrequited love for <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> Stan Carter (Timothy West). Babe's other storylines have included her past baby farming, encouraging Abi Branning (Lorna Fitzgerald) to fake a pregnancy, blackmailing Les Coker (Roger Sloman) and her subsequent feud with Claudette Hubbard (Ellen Thomas), and being attacked by an unknown character who was later revealed to be Abi.

5|$|Daniel Cady, Stanton's father, was a {{prominent}} Federalist attorney who served one term in the United States Congress (1814–1817) and then became both a circuit court judge and, in 1847, a New York Supreme Court justice. Judge Cady introduced his daughter to the law and, together with <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> Edward Bayard, planted the early seeds that grew into her legal and social activism. Even as a young girl, she enjoyed reading her father's law books and debating legal issues with his law clerks. It was this early exposure to law that, in part, caused Stanton to realize how disproportionately the law favored men over women, particularly married women. Her realization that married women had virtually no property, income, employment, or even custody rights over their own children, helped set her course toward changing these inequities.|$|E

5|$|Louise was {{the most}} artistically talented of Queen Victoria's daughters. As well as being an able actress, pianist and dancer, she was a {{prolific}} artist and sculptor. When Louise sculpted a statue of the Queen, portraying her in Coronation robes, the press claimed that her tutor, Sir Edgar Boehm, was the true creator of the work. The claim was denied by Louise's friends, who asserted her effort and independence. The work {{was intended to be}} exhibited in 1887, but production was delayed until 1893. A memorial to <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> Prince Henry of Battenberg, and a memorial to the Colonial soldiers who fell during the Boer War, reside at Whippingham Church on the Isle of Wight, and another statue of Queen Victoria remains at McGill University in Montreal.|$|E
5|$|Rowling {{was left}} in despair after her estranged husband arrived in Scotland, seeking both her and her daughter. She {{obtained}} an Order of Restraint, and Arantes returned to Portugal, with Rowling filing for divorce in August 1994. She began a teacher training course in August 1995 at the Moray House School of Education, at Edinburgh University, after completing her first novel while living on state benefits. She wrote in many cafés, especially Nicolson's Café (owned by <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law),</b> and the Elephant House, wherever she could get Jessica to fall asleep. In a 2001 BBC interview, Rowling denied the rumour that she wrote in local cafés to escape from her unheated flat, pointing out that it had heating. One of the reasons she wrote in cafés was that taking her baby {{out for a walk}} {{was the best way to}} make her fall asleep.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} the {{succession}} marked Louis' reign. Elizabeth was long considered barren, and a succession crisis was expected after the childless king's death. <b>Her</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> Stephen was heir presumptive {{until his death in}} 1354, when his son John replaced him. However, John also died in 1360. A daughter was born to the King and Queen in 1365, but the child died the next year. For a few years, John's sister, Elizabeth, was treated as heir presumptive and a suitable marriage for her was being negotiated. Things suddenly took a different course after Elizabeth had three daughters in quick succession; Catherine was born in July 1370, Mary in 1371, and Hedwig in 1373 or 1374. Elizabeth is known to have written a book for the education of her daughters, a copy of which was sent to France in 1374. However, all copies have been lost.|$|E

5|$|During World War II, Princess Andrew {{was in the}} {{difficult}} situation of having sons-in-law fighting on the German side and a son in the British Royal Navy. Her cousin, Prince Victor zu Erbach-Schönberg, was the German ambassador in Greece until the occupation of Athens by Axis forces in April 1941. She and her sister-in-law, Princess Nicholas of Greece (the mother of Princess Marina, Duchess of Kent), lived in Athens {{for the duration of}} the war, while most of the Greek royal family remained in exile in South Africa. She moved out of her small flat and into <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> George's three-storey house in the centre of Athens. She worked for the Red Cross, helped organize soup kitchens for the starving populace and flew to Sweden to bring back medical supplies on the pretext of visiting her sister, Louise, who was married to the Crown Prince. She organized two shelters for orphaned and stray children, and a nursing circuit for poor neighbourhoods.|$|E
5|$|Sudirman {{was born}} to Karsid Kartawiraji (father) and Siyem while they lived with Siyem's sister Tarsem, one of three women married to the sub-district head Raden Cokrosunaryo, in Rembang, Bodas Karangjati, Purbalingga, Dutch East Indies. According to the family's records, Sudirman– named by his uncle– was born on a pon Sunday {{in the month of}} Maulud in the Javanese calendar; the Indonesian {{government}} later established 24 January 1916 as Sudirman's birthday. As Cokrosunaryo was in a better financial situation, he adopted Sudirman and gave him the title Raden, reserved for Javanese nobility; however, Sudirman was not told that Cokrosunaryo was not his birth father until he was eighteen. When Cokrosunaryo retired from his position as chief in late 1916, Sudirman went with the family to Manggisan, Cilacap, where he was raised. In Cilacap Karsid and Siyem had another son, Muhammad Samingan. Karsid died when Sudirman was six, at which time Siyem left the boys with <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> and went back to her village at Parakan Onje, Ajibarang.|$|E
5|$|When George Clifford died in 1605, {{his wife}} Margaret became dowager countess and began {{repairing}} Brougham Castle, which became her favoured residence. Margaret contended with {{claims to the}} ownership of the family estates from <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law</b> Francis Clifford, 4th Earl of Cumberland, but held onto Brougham Castle. Her daughter, Lady Anne Clifford continued {{the restoration of the}} castle and other Clifford properties. The only one of Margaret's three children to survive childhood, Anne inherited the Clifford estates after her mother died in 1616. The inheritance was not without incident. The Earl of Cumberland again asserted his claim to the Clifford estates, however the privy council found in favour of Anne. The solution was only temporary, and in April 1617 the king decided that the Earl of Cumberland was the rightful heir, and the Clifford estates passed to Francis Clifford. Later the same year, JamesI visited Scotland and on his return journey he stayed at the castles of Carlisle, Brougham, and Appleby, where expensive banquets were given in his honour. It is estimated that the festivities cost around £1,200. After this, Brougham was almost forgotten by its owner and neglected.|$|E

5|$|In 1528, {{sweating}} sickness {{broke out}} with great severity. In London, {{the mortality rate}} was great and the court was dispersed. Henry left London, frequently changing his residence; Anne Boleyn retreated to the Boleyn residence at Hever Castle, but contracted the illness; <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> William Carey, died. Henry sent his own physician to Hever Castle to care for Anne, and shortly afterwards, she recovered. It soon became the one absorbing object of Henry's desires to secure an annulment from Catherine. Henry had set his hopes upon a direct appeal to the Holy See, acting independently of Cardinal Wolsey, to whom he at first communicated nothing of his plans related to Anne. In 1527 William Knight, the King's secretary, was sent to Pope Clement VII to sue for the annulment of his marriage to Catherine, {{on the grounds that}} the dispensing bull of Pope Julius II permitting him to marry his brother's widow, Catherine, had been obtained under false pretences. Henry also petitioned, in the event of his becoming free, a dispensation to contract a new marriage with any woman even in the first degree of affinity, whether the affinity was contracted by lawful or unlawful connection. This clearly referred to Anne.|$|E
5|$|Peggy {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with <b>her</b> <b>brother-in-law,</b> Archie, father of Ronnie (Samantha Womack) and Roxy Mitchell (Rita Simons). They get engaged and Archie begins subtly controlling Peggy. They marry, but it ends {{a few hours later}} when it is revealed that Archie lied to Ronnie about her infant daughter's death. Peggy has Archie evicted from The Queen Vic, and tries unsuccessfully to coerce Phil into murdering him. Peggy files for divorce and Archie plots revenge on the entire Mitchell family. When Peggy loses the bail surety she has paid on behalf of her daughter Sam (who breaks the conditions of her bail following coercion from Archie), the Mitchells are forced to use The Queen Victoria to gain a collateral Loan from Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Archie blackmails Ian to sell the loan to him, and when the Mitchells are unable to meet the loan repayment, Archie evicts them and assumes ownership of the pub. However, Archie is murdered on Christmas Day 2009 by an unknown assailant. Peggy grieves for Archie, but she and various other members of her family become suspects for his murder. Following a police enquiry, Bradley Branning (Charlie Clements) is posthumously found guilty of the murder, though unbeknown to everyone, the actual murderer is Bradley's wife, Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner), after Archie raped her. In his will, Archie leaves The Queen Vic to Roxy, who reinstates Peggy.|$|E
