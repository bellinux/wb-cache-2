40|$|Multipath {{in global}} {{positioning}} system (GPS) is the interference of the microwave signals directly from satellites and those reflected before reaching the antenna, typically by the ground. Because reflected signals cause positioning errors, GPS antennas are designed to reduce such interference. Recent studies show that multipath could be utilized to infer {{the properties of the}} ground around the antenna. Here, we report one such application, i. e. a fixed GPS station used as a snow depth meter. Because the satellite moves in the sky, the excess path length of reflected waves changes at rates dependent on the <b>antenna</b> <b>height.</b> This causes quasi-periodic variations of the amplitude and phase of the received signals. Accumulation of snow reduces <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>heights,</b> and we can see it by analyzing multipath signatures. Signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) are often used to analyze multipath, but they are not always available in raw GPS data files. Here, we demonstrate that the geometry-free linear combination (L 4), normally used to study the ionosphere, {{can also be used to}} analyze multipath signatures. We obtained snow depth time series at a GPS station in Hokkaido, Japan, from January to April in 2009 using L 4 and SNR. Then, we compared their precisions. We also discuss mechanisms responsible for the possible underestimation of the snow depth by GPS. Finally, we investigate the possibility of inferring physical conditions of the snow surface using amplitudes of multipath signatures...|$|R

40|$|In {{vehicles}} such as e. g. cabriolets, {{some parts}} of the skin are made of plastics e. g. the trunk lid. This makes the integration of antennas into these relatively narrow integration volumes possible. Since the radiation characteristics of a single antenna are restricted by a variety of boundary conditions in such a narrow environment, the overall directional characteristics of the antenna part can be optimised by using several of such very compact antenna elements and applying an antenna diversity system. It can be shown that the reception of such an integrated antenna diversity system leads to an excellent quality of reception, which is much higher than the one of a single mast antenna on the vehicle. Such compact diversity antennas in this narrow environment are possible due to an advanced concept of high impedance amplifiers which leads to a satisfying <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> even for relatively narrow antenna structures. In this concept a good reception quality is achieved with selectable frequency dependence, which is nearly independent of the frequency dependence of the effective length and impedance of the antenna structure while a high noisesensitivity and a high linearity are ensured at the same time. A powerful automatic gain control of the active antenna is implemented as well, in order to prevent nonlinear effects. As antenna elements for mobile FM- and TV-reception we use a novel ring structure made of copper wire, which is lai...|$|E
40|$|To {{support the}} {{continuously}} {{increasing number of}} mobile telephone users around the world, mobile communication systems have become more advanced and sophisticated in their designs. As {{a result of the}} great success with the second generation mobile radio networks, deployment of the third and development of fourth generations, the demand for higher data rates to support available services, such as internet connection, video telephony and personal navigation systems, is ever growing. To be able to meet the requirements regarding bandwidth and number of users, enhancements of existing systems and introductions of conceptually new technologies and techniques have been researched and developed. Although new proposed technologies in theory provide increased network capacity, the backbone of a successful roll-out of a mobile telephone system is inevitably the planning of the network’s cellular structure. Hence, the fundamental aspect to a reliable cellular planning is the knowledge about the physical radio channel for wide sets of different propagation scenarios. Therefore, to study radio wave propagation in typical Australian environments, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and the Australian Telecommunications Cooperative Research Centre (ATcrc) in collaboration developed a cellular code division multiple access (CDMA) pilot scanner. The pilot scanner measurement equipment enables for radio wave propagation measurements in available commercial CDMA mobile radio networks, which in Australia are usually deployed for extensive rural areas. Over time, the collected measurement data has been used to characterise many different types of mobile radio environments and some of the results are presented in this thesis. The thesis is divided into an introduction section and four parts based on peer-reviewed international research publications. The introduction section presents the reader with some relevant background on channel and propagation modelling. Also, the CDMA scanner measurement system that was developed in parallel with the research results founding this thesis is presented. The first part presents work on the evaluation and development of the different revisions of the Recommendation ITU-R P. 1546 point-to-area radio wave propagation prediction model. In particular, the modified application of the terrain clearance angle (TCA) and the calculation method of the <b>effective</b> <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> are scrutinized. In the second part, the correlation between the smallscale fading characteristics, described by the Ricean K-factor, and the vegetation density {{in the vicinity of the}} mobile receiving antenna is investigated. The third part presents an artificial neural network (ANN) based technique incorporated to predict path loss in rural macrocell environments. Obtained results, such as prediction accuracy and training time, are presented for different sized ANNs and different training approaches. Finally, the fourth part proposes an extension of the path loss ANN enabling the model to also predict small-scale fading characteristics...|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} low {{computational}} requirements, two-dimensional semiempirical wave propagation algorithms are still indispensable tools for terrestrial mobile communications and radio broadcasting coverage predictions {{in the very}} high and ultrahigh frequency bands. In this paper, we discuss various improvements of an algorithm based on digital terrain data. The algorithm combines the basic empirical propagation curves of Okumura et al. (1968) with terrain adaptive propagation curves derived from Fresnel zone clearance analyses of several terrain subsections. Also, a multiple knife-edge diffraction algorithm with approximate evaluation of the Kirchhoff diffraction integrals is applied when the line of sight is obstructed. Prediction quality is further improved by a robust algorithm for determination of <b>effective</b> transmitter <b>antenna</b> <b>heights,</b> and land usage along the terrain profile different from "open terrain" is considered by a multilevel Fresnel zone blockage evaluation. Prediction errors with standard deviations of about 6 to 7 dB were found for {{a great variety of}} measurements in flat and moderately undulating terrain.

40|$|Abstract—Ultra-wideband (UWB) {{technology}} is being proposed for several short range wireless applications. Some of the applications, such as position location devices for rescue personnel, may require the <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> {{to be close}} to the ground. In scenarios where the <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> is very low (from 0 to 30 cm), propagation characteristics and channel modeling are needed to provide important insights for the application design. This paper presents time-domain measurements and channel characterization of the indoor UWB channel at three different <b>antenna</b> <b>heights</b> (7. 5 cm, 26. 5 cm, and 108. 5 cm). The transmitting and receiving antennas are placed at heights referred to as near ground, middle ground, and above ground.

40|$|Abstract—An optimal {{power and}} <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> {{determination}} {{over a wide}} range of incidence angles is proposed for in-orbit operations of the spaceborne stripmap synthetic aperture radar (SAR) with variable <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> and variable radiating el-ement power. The <b>antenna</b> <b>height</b> and the average transmitted radio-frequency power of a radiating element for each incidence angle are determined so that the mapping area can be maximized with the constraints on the signal-to-noise ratio, ambiguities, and swath width, given the SAR geometry (an altitude and incidence angles) and radar wavelength. With the receive-chain power consumption of one transmit/receive module (= 10 mW) and the SAR instrument power consumption without the phased array antenna (= 5 W), the illustrative design example shows that the mapping area of the proposed SAR for the maximum incidence angle (max = 75) is about 269. 1 % of that resulted from utilizing only the variable <b>antenna</b> <b>height.</b> The proposed optimization would have a more beneficial effect on applications that need the high-incidence-angle operations.
