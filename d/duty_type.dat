50|$|An {{articulated}} hauler, articulated {{dump truck}} (ADT), or sometimes a Dump Hauler, {{is a very large}} heavy <b>duty</b> <b>type</b> of dump truck used to transport loads over rough terrain. The vehicle usually has all-wheel drive and consists of two basic units: the front section, generally called the tractor, and the rear section that contains the dump body, called the hauler or trailer section. Steering is made by pivoting the front in relation to the back by hydraulic rams. This way, all wheels follow the same path, making it an excellent off-road vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|Completely {{redesigned}} in 1960, this is {{the most}} familiar version of the Stout. The Japanese market had the 1,453 cc Type R engine in the RK45 and the 1,897 cc 3R-B engine in the RK100, which was introduced in October 1962. Along with the new optional engine, the Stout also underwent a facelift, including twin headlights. In September 1963 there also appeared a shorter and lighter <b>duty</b> (<b>type</b> RK40) model called [...] "Light Stout", which featured independent coil sprung front suspension for a more carlike ride. This was meant to compete directly with Nissan's Datsun minitrucks, but it never sold particularly well in its home market and was replaced by the Briska and Hilux following Toyota's takeover of Hino Motors.|$|E

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{examined the}} effect of justifications on trait attributions for immoral behaviors. Trait attribution {{has been shown to}} be trait dependent, and Immanuel Kant's philosophical distinctions of perfect and imperfect duty violation reflect some dependencies observed for moral traits. Previous research revealed asymmetric attribution effects for perfect duty violations, with strong negativity effects. Strong negative attributions appear to be caused by affective response (Trafimow, Bromgard, Finlay, & Ketelaar, 2005). To further the investigation into the trait attribution process across <b>duty</b> <b>types,</b> behavioral scenarios were coupled with justificatory intent statements. Results indicate that justifications had a positive effect on attributions for both perfect and imperfect duty violations, supporting the importance of affect in the moral trait attribution process.

5000|$|The [...] "Combat" [...] {{engine was}} {{released}} in January 1972, with a twin roller bearing crank, 10:1 compression and developing [...] at 6,500 rpm. Reliability immediately suffered, with frequent and early crank-shaft main-bearing failures, sometimes leading to broken crankshafts. Older engines had used one ball-bearing main bearing and one roller bearing main bearing but the Combat engine featured two roller bearings in a mistaken belief this would strengthen the bottom-end {{to cope with the}} higher power-output. Instead the resultant crank-bending caused the rollers to [...] "dig-in" [...] to the races, causing rapid failure. This fragility was particularly obvious when measured against the reliability of contemporary Japanese machines. This problem was solved by specifying a heavier <b>duty</b> <b>type</b> of spherical roller bearing, of 'superblend' fame, later in the 1972 production year.|$|E

Most experienced interior firefighters (firefighters that enter the structure in an emergency) will carry, in their turnout trouser pockets, various tools and equipment as well as rope they may need during an emergency. The turnout trousers, when not in use, are usually stored scrunched down around the boots for efficient and fast access when they are needed. The firefighter may then step into each boot and pull up the trousers and suspenders.|$|E

50|$|The New South Wales Police Force {{has three}} grades of Senior Constable, namely senior constable (two chevrons), {{incremental}} senior constable (two chevrons and a horizontal bar) and leading senior constable (two chevrons and two horizontal bars). A senior constable is senior to a constable but junior to an incremental senior constable. Promotion to Senior Constable can occur after a miniumum of 5 years service, one {{year as a}} Probationary Constable in addition to 4 years as Constable and then upon passing probity checks and an exam. Incremental Senior Constable is attained after 10 years of service automatically. One is appointed the rank of Leading Senior Constable on a qualification basis but must have a minimum of 7 years service amongst other criteria {{in order to be}} eligible. Leading Senior Constable is a specialist position of which there are limited allocated numbers within any section/unit or Local Area Command. If an officer is transferred to another <b>duty</b> <b>type</b> or station, the officer is then relieved of the position of Leading Senior Constable. It is primarily a position for Field Training Officers who oversee the training and development of inexperienced Probationary Constables or Constables.|$|E
5000|$|Cab over engine (COE) or flat nose, {{where the}} driver is seated {{on top of the}} front axle and the engine. The front doors are {{typically}} in front of and above the front tires. This design is almost ubiquitous in Europe, where overall truck lengths are strictly regulated. They were common in the United States and Canada but such body style in heavy <b>duty</b> <b>type</b> trucks lost prominence, when the legally permitted length was extended in the early 1980s. Nevertheless, COE's are still popular among medium and light duty trucks in the United States. To access the engine, the whole cab tilts forward, earning this design the name of tilt-cab. This type of cab is especially suited to the delivery conditions in Europe where many roads follow the layout of much more ancient path and trackways which require the additional turning capability of the cab over engine type. The operating conditions of these vehicles tend to be cooler than the conventional cab design and so the increased engine surface area used for cooling in hotter climates is not required. Access to a COE cab is commonly by steps forward of the front tires.|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedU. S. Navy Submarine Approach Officers (AO) use tactical skills acquired from years at sea and a seemingly natural panache to accurately determine an enemy submarine's bearing range, course, and speed. This thesis investigates {{the effects of}} AO demographic differences and combat system employment methodologies {{on the ability to}} develop a timely and accurate firing solution. Employing a low-resolution submarine combat simulator, approximately 10 percent of the total pool of AO's were taken through two of four pre-scripted initial contact scenarios. The AO's were instructed to execute each scenario until they perceive that an accurate solution is obtained on the enemy submarine. The demographic differences of geographic location, ship type, and <b>duty</b> <b>type</b> are the top three traits that distinguish between success and failure. Further data analysis reveals differences in the information utilization of the simulator between successful and unsuccessful operators. Additionally, utilizing a survey administered to the subjects and basic display design principles, a notional command workstation {{for the next generation of}} submarine is developed. The conclusions of this research provide insight into the cognitive modeling, training, and selection of AO's, as well as adding to the growing body of work in the design of military decision support systems.

40|$|The {{mention of}} {{hyperbaric}} treatment to many health professionals will usually {{result in a}} blank stare, or the comment that {{it has something to}} do with deep-sea diving. Few realize the many clinical and research applications hyperbaric oxygen treatment offers. Several years ago the Center established a hyperbaric oxygen treatment facility (only one of two in this city of 300, 000) which is frequently used for clinical treatment and research. Unlike most hyperbaric chambers, our chamber is a custom made, heavy <b>duty</b> <b>type</b> which could be used for decompression treatment, if necessary. Although hyperbaric treatment is commonly associated with diving applications, clinical use of pressure medicine predated the diving use by more than 200 years. In 1662, Henshaw, a British physician, designed a chamber he called the "domicilium " which used large organ bellows fitted with valves. ' He could compress the air inside the chamber or remove the air by use of the bellows. Dr. Henshaw used increased pressure to treat acute diseases and reduced pressures to treat chronic diseases. In 1666, Robert Boyle described the behavior of animals in a pressurized environment. In the early part of the 19 th century, a pneumatic institute was established at Oxford University for the study of gases and gas mixtures in the treatment of diseases. In 1834, V. T. Junod designed a copper chamber in order to study the physiological and therapeutic action of compres-sion and rarefaction of air on the human body. 1 In 1878, Paul Bert carefully described the mechanisms of oxygen toxicity. Dr. Bert's work was a major turning point in the evolution of diving and clinical hyperbaric medicine. 2 Others making major contributions t...|$|E

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study seeks {{to determine if}} military duties and assignments affect the marriage and divorce decisions of United States Navy officers. Previous studies suggest that a stable marriage can have {{a positive influence on}} a military member's performance. However, no previous research has looked specifically at how duties and assignments may affect the marital status of Navy officers. This thesis presents an overview of <b>duty</b> <b>types</b> in the Navy and various factors that are believed to affect the marriage and divorce decisions of Navy officers. Based on the literature review, five hypotheses are generated and tested by estimating 32 logit models. The results show that military duties and assignments, gender, and commissioning sources significantly affect the likelihood and timin g of marriage and divorce decisions of Navy officers. The results provide important information that can be used by policy makers to help reduce the adverse effects of duties and assignments on Navy marriages. The study also looks at the relationship bet ween marriage on divorce and the member's decision to leave the Navy. It is recommended that further research be conducted regarding the effects of duties and assignments on divorce for enlisted personnel and members of other US armed forces.
