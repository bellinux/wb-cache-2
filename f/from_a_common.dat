5|$|Hydnellum ferrugineum fruit bodies {{contain the}} {{pigments}} hydnuferrigin (dark violet) and hydnuferruginin (yellow), {{as well as}} small amounts of the polyphenol compound atromentin. Hydnuferrigin has a chemical structure that closely resembles that of thelephoric acid, a pigment found in other species of Hydnellum and Hydnum, and they may originate <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> precursor compound.|$|E
5|$|In 1859, Charles Darwin {{explained}} homologous structures as {{meaning that}} the organisms concerned shared a body plan <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor, and that taxa were branches of a single tree of life.|$|E

5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of Cyclura nubila are the Grand Cayman blue iguana (Cyclura lewisi) and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana (Cyclura cychlura); phylogenetic analysis indicates that these three species diverged <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor three million years ago.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "knowledge commons" [...] {{refers to}} information, data, and content that is collectively owned and managed by a {{community}} of users, particularly over the Internet. What distinguishes <b>a</b> knowledge <b>commons</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>commons</b> of shared physical resources is that digital resources are non-subtractible; that is, multiple users can access the same digital resources with no effect on their quantity or quality.|$|R

5|$|The manuscripts are {{all thought}} to derive <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> original, but the {{connections}} between the texts are more complex than simple inheritance via copying.

5|$|The {{study of}} early dinosaurs such as Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor {{therefore}} {{has important implications}} for the concept of dinosaurs as a monophyletic group (a group descended <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor). The monophyly of dinosaurs was explicitly proposed in the 1970s by Galton and Robert T. Bakker, who compiled a list of cranial and postcranial synapomorphies (common anatomical traits derived from the common ancestor). Later authors proposed additional synapomorphies. An extensive study of Herrerasaurus by Sereno in 1992 suggested that of these proposed synapomorphies, only one cranial and seven postcranial features were actually derived <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor, and that the others were attributable to convergent evolution. Sereno's analysis of Herrerasaurus also led him to propose several new dinosaurian synapomorphies.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 genetic {{study by}} {{evolutionary}} biologist Emma Harrower and colleagues of C.violaceus and its closest relatives {{suggests that the}} group (section Cortinarius) originated in Australasia and began diverging <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor around 12 million {{years ago in the}} Miocene, with C.violaceus itself diverging from its closest relative around 3.9 million years ago. The fact that these species diverged relatively recently indicates that some form of dispersal must have taken place across large bodies of water. The original plant hosts were flowering plants (angiosperms), and C.violaceus—or its direct ancestor—developed a symbiotic relationship with pines, as well as multiple flowering plants; this may have facilitated its expansion across the Northern Hemisphere.|$|E

50|$|Demethylation is the {{chemical}} process {{resulting in the}} removal of a methyl group (CH3) <b>from</b> <b>a</b> molecule. <b>A</b> <b>common</b> way of demethylation is the replacement of a methyl group by a hydrogen atom, resulting in {{a net loss of}} one carbon and two hydrogen atoms.|$|R
5|$|A central {{organizing}} {{concept in}} biology is that life changes and develops through evolution, {{and that all}} life-forms known have a common origin. The theory of evolution postulates that all organisms on the Earth, both living and extinct, have descended <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor or an ancestral gene pool. This universal common ancestor of all organisms {{is believed to have}} appeared about 3.5 billion years ago. Biologists regard the ubiquity of the genetic code as definitive evidence in favor of the theory of universal common descent for all bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes (see: origin of life).|$|E
5|$|All the {{foregoing}} rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, {{on the view}} that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,...|$|E
5|$|Amanita bisporigera {{belongs to}} section Phalloideae {{of the genus}} Amanita, which {{contains}} some of the deadliest Amanita species, including A.phalloides and A.virosa. This classification has been upheld with phylogenetic analyses, which demonstrate that the toxin-producing members of section Phalloideae form a clade—that is, they derive <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor. In 2005, Zhang and colleagues performed a phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences of several white-bodied toxic Amanita species, {{most of which are}} found in Asia. Their results support a clade containing A. bisporigera, A.subjunquillea var. alba, A.exitialis, and A.virosa. The Guangzhou destroying angel (Amanita exitialis) has two-spored basidia, like A.bisporigera.|$|E

5|$|Biological {{structures}} or sequences {{in different}} taxa are homologous {{if they are}} derived <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor. Homology thus implies divergent evolution. For example, many insects (such as dragonflies) possess two pairs of flying wings. In beetles, the first pair of wings {{has evolved into a}} pair of hard wing covers, while in Dipteran flies the second pair of wings has evolved into small halteres used for balance.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{sequences}} can be {{mapped to}} reveal a phylogenetic tree that represents evolutionary relationships, with each branch point representing the divergence of two lineages <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor. On this tree the term basal is used to describe a lineage that forms a branch diverging nearest to the common ancestor. Wolf genetic sequencing has found the Beringian wolf to be basal to all other gray wolves except for the modern Indian gray wolf and Himalayan wolf, and the extinct Belgian clade of Pleistocene wolves.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of {{both the}} Malagasy pygmy {{hippopotamus}} and H. lemerlei show a cursorial adaptation, distinct from the hippos on the African continent, {{and they would have}} been much better runners. This common trait is a possible indicator that both species of Malagasy hippo descended <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor, and that the similarities to the modern hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are a case of parallel evolution.|$|E

5|$|In 2008, {{advances}} in DNA analysis allowed {{a more detailed}} study of the fisher's evolutionary history. It was determined that the fisher and the Martes genera were descended <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor but the fisher was distinct enough {{to put it in}} its own genera. It was decided to create the Pekania genera and reclassify the fisher as Pekania pennanti.|$|E
5|$|In his 1918 {{revision}} of North American Oryzomys, Goldman considered O.nelsoni {{to be most}} {{closely related to the}} nearest mainland subspecies of O.couesi, O.couesi mexicanus. In 2009, Michael Carleton and Joaquin Arroyo-Cabrales revised the Oryzomys of western Mexico and confirmed that O.nelsoni is a very distinct species. Their morphometrical analysis found some resemblance between the species and Oryzomys albiventer of interior mainland Mexico, and they suggested that although O.nelsoni likely represents an old, distinctive lineage, it may have derived <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> ancestor with O.albiventer.|$|E
5|$|In the city, Argante and Armida, {{in danger}} <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>common</b> enemy, become {{reconciled}} and prepare their troops for battle.

After {{a struggle for}} supremacy, Jerusalem falls to Goffredo; Argante is overcome and captured by Rinaldo, while Armida is taken by Eustazio. Rinaldo and Almirena celebrate their love and forthcoming marriage. Armida, accepting her defeat, breaks the wand which {{is the source of}} her evil power and together with Argante embraces Christianity. Goffredo expresses his forgiveness to his beaten foes and sets them free, before victors and vanquished join in a chorus of reconciliation.|$|E
