25|$|Since {{the growth}} of the theosophical {{movement}} in the 19th century, and influenced by theosophy's articulations on the Maitreya, non-Buddhist religious and spiritual movements have adopted and reinterpreted the concept in their doctrines. Share International, which equates Maitreya with the prophesied figures of multiple religious traditions, claims that he is already present in the world, but is preparing to make an open declaration of his presence in the near future. They claim that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>here</b> to inspire mankind to create a new era based on sharing and justice.|$|E
25|$|The villagers of Ploverleigh are {{preparing}} to celebrate the betrothal of Alexis Pointdextre, {{the son of the}} local baronet, and the blue-blooded Aline Sangazure ("Ring forth, ye bells"). Only a young village maiden named Constance Partlet seems unwilling to join in the happy mood, and we learn as she tells her mother that she is secretly in love with the local vicar, Dr Daly ("When <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>here,</b> I sigh with pleasure"); and the cleric himself promptly soliloquises that he has been unlucky in love ("The air is charged with amatory numbers"). However, despite Mrs. Partlet's best attempts at matchmaking, the middle-aged Dr Daly seems unable to conceive that a young girl like Constance would be interested in him.|$|E

25|$|The crow helps Eric locate Tin Tin; Eric kills him by {{stabbing}} him in each vital organ, {{in alphabetical}} order, {{with his own}} knives and then takes his coat. He then goes to the pawn shop where Tin Tin pawned Shelly's engagement ring the year before. Eric forces the owner, Gideon, to return the ring. Eric then tosses rings telling Gideon each {{of them is a}} life - a life Gideon helped destroy. He lets Gideon live so that he can warn the others and blows up his shop. Eric then meets up with Albrecht, explains who he is and why <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>here.</b> Eric finds Funboy getting high with Sarah's drug-addict mother, Darla. After killing Funboy with an overdose of morphine, Eric talks to Darla, taking the drug out of her arm seemingly by magic and making her realize that Sarah needs her to be a good mother. He later visits Albrecht, at his house. Albrecht tells him what he knows about Shelly's death and that he watched as she suffered for thirty hours before dying. Eric touches Albrecht and receives from him the pain felt by Shelly during those hours. The next day, Sarah and her mother begin to repair their strained relationship. Sarah goes to Eric's apartment and talks to him. She tells him that she misses him and Shelly. Eric explains that, even though they cannot be friends anymore, he still cares about her.|$|E
500|$|At this moment, cries {{are heard}} from the Knights (""): a flying swan has been shot, and a young man is brought forth, a bow {{in his hand and}} a quiver of {{matching}} arrows. Gurnemanz speaks sternly to the lad, saying this is a holy place. He asks him outright if he shot the swan, and the lad boasts that if it flies, he can hit it ("") Gurnemanz tells him that the swan is a holy animal, and asks what harm the swan had done him, and shows the youth its lifeless body. Now remorseful, the young man breaks his bow and casts it aside. Gurnemanz asks him why <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>here,</b> who his father is, how he found this place and, lastly, his name. To each question the lad replies, [...] "I don't know." [...] The elder Knight sends his squires away to help the King and now asks the boy to tell what he does know. The young man says he has a mother, Herzeleide (Heart's Sorrow) and that he made the bow himself. Kundry has been listening and now tells them that this boy's father was Gamuret, a knight killed in battle, and also how the lad's mother had forbidden her son to use a sword, fearing that he would meet the same fate as his father. The youth now recalls that upon seeing knights pass through his forest, he had left his home and mother to follow them. Kundry laughs and tells the young man that, as she rode by, she saw Herzeleide die of grief. Hearing this, the lad first lunges at Kundry but then collapses in grief. Kundry herself is now weary for sleep, but cries out that she must not sleep and wishes that she might never again waken. She disappears into the undergrowth.|$|E

2500|$|In 1918, Karen Blixen met the English {{big game}} hunter Denys Finch Hatton (1887–1931), an English army officer from an upper-class background. He often {{travelled}} {{back and forth}} between Africa and England, and visited her occasionally. After her separation from her husband she and Finch Hatton developed a close friendship, which eventually became a long-term love affair. In a letter to her brother Thomas in 1924, she wrote: [...] "I believe that for all time and eternity I am bound to Denys, to love the ground he walks upon, to be happy beyond words when <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>here,</b> and to suffer worse than death many times when he leaves..." [...] But other letters in her collections show that the relationship was unstable, and that Blixen's increasing dependence upon Finch Hatton, who was intensely independent, was an issue.|$|E
2500|$|It is at {{this point}} that Wilson's own {{memories}} end, but the Scarecrow Guide informs him that all Dreamscapes are connected, and {{he will be able to}} uncover the truth of Amelia's disappearance if he continues searching. He begins by going back to the barn and discovering Amelia's necklace. It is also while <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>here</b> that he remembers a conversation he had with Amelia the day before the wedding, where she expressed concern for Frank after he called her and told her to cancel the wedding. As a result of this, she told Wilson she didn't want him at the wedding in case he did something stupid. Wilson recalls a telephone conversation he overheard Frank having one day at the airfield, and realizes that this conversation was the one Amelia was referring to. He remembers that Frank told her to meet him at their special spot so they can talk. This special spot is the lake, which is the location where Amelia and Frank had their one and only date many years prior. After he discovered that Amelia intended to follow through and marry Wilson, he drowned her in a fit of anger, telling her that [...] "If I can't have you, no one can." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 2001, Tarkan {{became the}} first Pepsi {{spokesperson}} in Turkey. This preceded the release of his album Karma {{and for the first}} time two singles in his domestic market in the same year: [...] "Kuzu Kuzu" [...] ("Like A Lamb") and [...] "Hüp" [...] ("Whoop"). Although Karma was not released worldwide, it was distributed in large shipments to Russia, where he had become the largest-selling non-Russian pop star. A million copies shipped to other areas of Europe, including Denmark. His so-called Karma-era style projected an image totally different from his earlier persona in respect to both music and looks. His appearance – tight trousers, loose, unbuttoned shirts or tight T-shirts – and his new hairdo set a trend among young Turkish men, who started to copy his looks. According to hairdressers, his Kuzu Kuzu hairstyle is still the most frequently requested style in the salons of Turkey. During this time he met Michael Lang, co-organiser of the Woodstock Festival, who became his international manager. According to Lang: [...] "Tarkan is a great singer and his performance is great. His current success is only the beginning in my opinion. He'll be a star in five-year's time and he will not fade away. Know this, <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>here</b> to stay.

2500|$|It is {{admitted}} that the doctrine as defined by Pius IX was not explicitly mooted before the 12th century. It is also agreed that [...] "no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture". But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained {{in the teaching of}} the Fathers. Their expressions {{on the subject of the}} sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as [...] "in every respect holy", [...] "in all things unstained", [...] "super-innocent", and [...] "singularly holy" [...] are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is [...] "the earth before it was accursed". The well-known words of St. Augustine (d. 430) may be cited: [...] "As regards the mother of God," [...] he says, [...] "I will not allow any question whatever of sin." [...] It is true that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>here</b> speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin [...] "of every sort" [...] (omni ex parte).|$|E
