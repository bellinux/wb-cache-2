5|$|Though not {{resident}} {{in the two}} boys' household, Edward <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> great interest in the princes' upbringing and well-being. Before he died, the king had promised to provide Edmund with substantial grants of land. In August 1306, Edward I signed a charter promising Edmund land worth 7000 marks a year, and in May 1307, 1000 marks was added to this. He probably intended to give the earldom of Norfolk to Thomas, while Edmund would receive the earldom of Cornwall, which had been left vacant after Edward I's cousin Edmund died without children in 1300. When Edward II came to the throne, however, he went against his father's wishes by granting the earldom of Cornwall to his favourite Piers Gaveston. According to the chronicle Vita Edwardi Secundi, this act was a grave insult to the king's younger brothers. Edward II nevertheless took steps to provide his half-brother with an income; grants made in 1315 and 1319 secured Edmund 2000 marks a year. In May 1321, Edmund received the strategically important Gloucester Castle, and further grants followed his creation as Earl of Kent on 28 July 1321.|$|E
25|$|When Frederick I of the House of Hohenzollern {{took over}} the Electorate of Brandenburg in 1411, he and his successors {{restricted}} {{the influence of the}} local nobles, towns and clergy, and followed a policy of territorial expansion. Since the eastern frontier with Pomerania, the Neumark, was pawned to the Teutonic Order state from 1402 to 1455, the western frontier (Uckermark) was in the focus of the Brandenburg–Pomeranian conflict: The first major battle between the Pomeranian and Hohenzollern armies took place in 1412 at Kremmer Damm, only one year after Frederick <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> over the electorate.|$|E

Bolesław, after the Polish-German War (1002–1018), signed the Peace of Bautzen on 30 January 1018, which made Bolesław I a clear winner. The Polish ruler {{was able to keep}} the contested marches of Lusatia and Sorbian Meissennot as fiefs, but as part of Polish territory. The Polish prince Mieszko {{destroyed}} a 100 Sorbian villages in 1030 and expelled them from urban areas, exception made of fisherman and carpenters, who were allowed to live in the outskirts.|$|E

[...] He told his colleagues, [...] "I have three daughters, but, so help me God, I had rather find either one of them killed by a tiger or a bear [...] than to have her crawl to me and tell me the horrid story that she had been robbed of the jewel of her womanhood by a black fiend." [...] In 1907, he told the senators about the Ellenton riot of 1876, [...] "it was then that we shot them; it was then that we killed them; it was then that we stuffed the ballot-boxes." ...|$|E
500|$|On the {{afternoon}} of this day I was taking a walk with the steward of the convent in the neighbourhood, and as we returned, towards sunset, he begged me to take some refreshment {{with him in his}} cell. Scarcely had he entered the room, when, resuming our former subject of conversation, he said: [...] "And I, too, have read a Septuagint" [...] – i.e. a copy of the Greek translation made by the Seventy. And so saying, he took down from {{the corner of the room}} a bulky kind of volume, wrapped up in a red cloth, and laid it before me. I unrolled the cover, and discovered, to my great surprise, not only those very fragments which, fifteen years before, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> out of the basket, but also other parts of the Old Testament, the New Testament complete, and, in addition, the Epistle of Barnabas and a part of the Shepherd of Hermas.|$|E

Shortly after the tour Mascherino left the band, although his departure was not announced until early October. He said, [...] "It was getting to the point where I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the road as long as I possibly could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go." [...] Mascherino had written over 45 songs, most intended for Louder Now but turned down by the band. He began a solo project, the Color Fred.|$|E

500|$|McGovern {{enrolled}} at small Dakota Wesleyan University in Mitchell {{and became a}} star student there. He supplemented a forensic scholarship by working a variety of odd jobs. With World War II underway overseas and feeling insecure about his own courage, McGovern took flying lessons in an Aeronca aircraft and received a pilot's license through the government's Civilian Pilot Training Program. McGovern recalled: [...] "Frankly, I {{was scared to death}} on that first solo flight. But when I walked away from it, I had an enormous feeling of satisfaction that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the thing off the ground and landed it without tearing the wings off." [...] In late 1940 or early 1941, McGovern had a brief affair with an acquaintance that resulted in her giving birth to a daughter during 1941, although this did not become public knowledge during his lifetime. In April 1941, McGovern began dating fellow student Eleanor Stegeberg, who had grown up in Woonsocket, South Dakota. They had first encountered each other during a high school debate in which Eleanor and her twin sister Ila defeated McGovern and his partner.|$|E
500|$|However, Mascherino {{left the}} band {{following}} {{the end of}} the tour. He said, [...] "It was {{getting to the point where}} I felt <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> the road as long as I possibly could," [...] and his compositions were [...] "more pop than anyone else [...] wanted to go". In October, the group revealed that their next album was [...] "in its very early stages". In December, Rubano said the group was in New York City working on new material, having already written six songs. Prior to demoing, O'Connell had to have back surgery, having injured it during the Projekt Revolution tour. During the demoing process, the group tried different drummers, but according to Rubano: [...] "They just weren't Mark. Not enough ferocity, intensity." [...] Following this, the band's members took time to refocus themselves after several years of constant touring. Lazzara sorted his life out following addiction issues, ending his engagement to Chauntelle DuPree of Eisley. He subsequently moved to another town, got married, and had a child. O'Connell also got married, Reyes spent time with his family, and Rubano recorded music for the TV show Electric Company.|$|E
500|$|In 1803, after a {{succession}} of commands, Heywood was promoted to post-captain. In command of , Heywood {{conducted a series of}} surveys of the eastern coasts of Ceylon and India, areas that had not been studied previously, and produced what Alexander describes as [...] "beautifully drafted charts". In later years he was to produce similar charts for the north coast of Morocco, the River Plate area of South America, parts of the coasts of Sumatra and north-west Australia, and other channels and coastlines. His skill in this area may well have developed from Bligh's tutelage in the earlier stages of the Bounty voyage. Bligh, an accomplished draughtsman, had written of Christian and Heywood: [...] "These two had been objects of my particular regard and attention, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> great pains to instruct them." [...] James Horsburgh, who was hydrographer to the East India Company, wrote that Heywood's work had [...] "essentially contributed to making my Sailing Directory for the Indian navigation much more perfect than it would otherwise have been." [...] The extent of Heywood's professional reputation was demonstrated when the position of Admiralty Hydrographer was offered to him in 1818, after he had retired from the sea. He declined, and the appointment went to Francis Beaufort on Heywood's recommendation.|$|E

500|$|Middleton's VIII Corps was {{assigned}} a 50-mile front, half of which belonged to the 2nd Division {{and the other half}} to the 8th Division. The front extended from Losheim, on the German-Belgian border, to central Luxembourg. On 11 October, the 83rd Division was brought back under VIII Corps control, and another 38 miles of front in Luxembourg was added to the responsibility of the corps. The new 9th Armored Division was added to the lineup on 20 October, but put into corps reserve by Middleton. [...] During October and into November these divisions ran deception maneuvers to confuse the Germans, and also became thoroughly familiar with the terrain so as to be able to absorb a heavy thrust from the enemy should they be attacked. However, from mid-November to early December the three well-prepared infantry divisions were all replaced by two battle-weary divisions and one green division. Both the 28th Infantry Division and the 4th Infantry Division, Middleton's old division from World War <b>I,</b> <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> heavy losses in the Huertgen Forest, and were at less than 75% normal strength. The 106th Infantry Division was just entering the lineup with no combat experience. Middleton now had about 68,000 officers and men in his corps, many weary and many uninitiated, along an 88-mile front facing about 200,000 veteran German troops who were deftly moving into position under the cover of darkness.|$|E
