25|$|Confederate Lieutenant Robert M. Smith was {{captured}} and imprisoned at Johnson's Island, Ohio. He {{is unique in}} {{that he was able}} to secretly construct a wet-plate camera using a pine box, pocket knife, tin can, and spyglass lens. Smith acquired chemicals from the prison hospital to use for the photographic process. He used the camera clandestinely to photograph other prisoners at the gable end of the attic of cell block four. No other prison had an on-site photographer providing images for the imprisoned to send home. His contribution is well presented in David R. Bush's I <b>Fear</b> <b>I</b> Shall Never Leave This Island: Life in a Civil War Prison (2011).|$|E

He returned to England in June 1919.|$|E

They were permitted to visit him on 29 January, and he bade them a tearful farewell. The following morning, he called for two shirts to prevent the cold weather causing any noticeable shivers that the crowd could have mistaken for fear: [...] "the season is so sharp as probably may make me shake, which some observers may imagine proceeds from <b>fear.</b> <b>I</b> would have no such imputation." ...|$|E

I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. I think it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time. She's a very intelligent woman but I don't see much to <b>fear.</b> <b>I</b> will say it is great to have a woman {{in charge of the}} country.

John Le Mesurier described Jacques as [...] "a remarkable lady... had an aura of love and kindness about her", while her obituary in The Times observed that [...] "she will be remembered with affection by all who saw her".

500|$|When an English anarchist named John Turner {{was arrested}} under the Anarchist Exclusion Act and {{threatened}} with deportation, Goldman {{joined forces with}} the Free Speech League to champion his cause. The league enlisted the aid of attorneys Clarence Darrow and Edgar Lee Masters, who took Turner's case to the US Supreme Court. Although Turner and the League lost, Goldman considered it a victory of propaganda. She had returned to anarchist activism, but it was taking its toll on her. [...] "I never felt so weighed down," [...] she wrote to Berkman. [...] "I <b>fear</b> <b>I</b> am forever doomed to remain public property and to have my life worn out through the care for the lives of others." ...|$|E

During a trip to Lake Biel, Hański went to arrange lunch, leaving his wife and Balzac alone. In the shade of a large oak tree, they kissed and exchanged vows of patience and fidelity. She told him of the family's plan to visit Geneva for Christmas; Balzac agreed to visit {{before the end of the}} year. Before he left Nauchâtel, she sent a passionate letter to his hotel: [...] "Villain! Did you not see in my eyes all that I longed for? But have no <b>fear,</b> <b>I</b> felt all the desire that a woman in love seeks to provoke".|$|E
500|$|Although he {{performed}} on the album, drummer Ward was unable to tour because of {{the pressures of the}} road, and quit the band after the commencement of the Born Again album. [...] "I fell apart with the idea of touring", Ward later said. [...] "I got so much fear behind touring, I didn't talk about the <b>fear,</b> <b>I</b> drank behind the fear instead and that was a big mistake." [...] Ward was replaced by former Electric Light Orchestra drummer Bev Bevan for the Born Again '83 -'84 world tour, (often unofficially referred to as the 'Feigh Death Sabbath '83 – '84' World Tour) which began in Europe with Diamond Head, and later in the US with Quiet Riot and Night Ranger.

500|$|The 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon {{included}} a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing {{a version of}} Hung Up by Madonna. [...] Although the character had not yet made her on-screen debut in the programme, Lewington as Maddy appeared in the sketch - as did fellow newcomers Peter Wingfield (Dan Clifford) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) who also had yet to arrive in the show itself. The 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Lewington, alongside Rakie Ayola (Kyla Tyson) and Phoebe Thomas (Maria Kendall) provided backing vocals for Sharon D Clarke (Lola Griffin), who performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, Respect. Lewington said of these appearances: [...] "I had {{the time of my}} life...Woo hoo! Loved every second. Although I was a gibbering wreck before the live performance of 'Respect'. Sharon D Clarke was amazing, not a whisper of <b>fear.</b> <b>I</b> however was convinced that I was going to forget everything and stare blankly into the eyes of 14 million viewers or however many squillions there were watching. All went well though and I've {{got a little bit of}} history in my dvd collection ready for the grand kiddies!" [...] Lewington has also appeared in a Holby City vs. Casualty special episode of BBC Two quiz show The Weakest Link, alongside co-stars Phoebe Thomas, Tom Chambers (Sam Strachan), Duncan Pow (Linden Cullen) and Robert Powell (Mark Williams).|$|E
500|$|Richard {{views the}} album as her take on medieval literature, but calls her lyrics less [...] "literal" [...] than {{contemporary}} pop music. Lyrically, she portrays {{herself as an}} embattled queen in acts of guarding, fighting, surrendering, and conquering. She murmurs in the intro to [...] "Warfaire", [...] "I fight a battle every day, against discouragement and <b>fear</b> ... <b>I</b> must forever be on guard." [...] The track's misspelled title is taken from the television series Game of Thrones. On [...] "Goliath", she declares, [...] "I faced the Beast with my bare hands". [...] "Gleaux" [...] is an eccentric spelling of [...] "glow", referring to what the narrator wants {{to do with her}} lover to see each other in the night. [...] "Tug of War" [...] concludes a conflicted quest for dominance at the expense of a lover's power. On the power ballad [...] "Break of Dawn", Richard promises herself and a love interest that he will [...] "never see the break of dawn". Richard, who wanted the album to end on a [...] "hopeful" [...] note, said that the title track [...] "speaks of the fairytale. That naïveté. That moment where you felt anything is possible." [...] According to Laurie Tuffrey of The Quietus, the song concludes Goldenhearts lyrical arc with a [...] "wistful retrospect" [...] on a relationship that began with Richard's declaring her [...] "champion" [...] on [...] "In the Hearts Tonight" [...] and shifted to [...] "Tug of War", where she became [...] "her own champion".|$|E
500|$|Oblivions {{score was}} {{composed}} by series mainstay Jeremy Soule, {{a video game}} composer whose past scores had earned him a British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) award in the [...] "Game Music Category" [...] and two nominations for an Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences (AIAS) award for [...] "Original Music Composition". The official soundtrack to Oblivion, featuring 26 tracks spanning 58 minutes; it was released in March 2006, via Soule's digital distributor DirectSong. Soule had worked with Bethesda and Todd Howard during the creation of Morrowind, and, in a press release announcing his return for Oblivion, Soule repeated the words he had said during Morrowinds press release: [...] "The stunning, epic quality of The Elder Scrolls series is particularly compatible with the grand, orchestral style of music I enjoy composing the most". As in his compositions for Morrowind, Soule chose to create a soft and minimalist score {{so as not to}} wear out users' ears. Soule stated that while composing the music he did not imagine any specific characters or events; rather, he wanted it [...] "to comment on the human condition and the beauty of life". In a 2006 interview, he related that this desire came {{as a result of a}} car accident that occurred during his composition of the score. He said, [...] "I ended up rolling in my car several times on an interstate while flying headlong into oncoming traffic ... I felt no <b>fear</b> ... <b>I</b> simply just acknowledged to myself that I've had a good life and I would soon have to say goodbye to all of it in a matter of seconds". Soule sustained only minor injuries, but commented that his feeling during the crash—"that life is indeed precious"—remained with him throughout the rest of the composition.|$|E

Although Robertson retained the special powers he had been granted in December 1915, and Lord Derby, an ally of the soldiers, was appointed Under-Secretary, Robertson still wrote to Kiggell (26 June 1916) “That d----d fellow L.G. is coming here I <b>fear.</b> <b>I</b> shall have an awful time.” ...|$|E

It has become {{difficult for me to}} continue bearing the responsibility for decisions with which I do not agree and the consequences of which I <b>fear.</b> <b>I</b> cannot bear the responsibility for a single drop of blood before God, before my own conscience or the citizens..."

That's the reason I got into Buddhism, took EST training, was into therapy, into Scientology, into Transcendental Meditation. I was trying to support that side of myself. But, you know, in Texas there isn't much support for that part of you." [...] He also had said how he is interested in and loves looking into different [...] belief systems and faith, how it matters to other people, and how these various religious teachings are important to him in his world. He sought treatment for alcoholism by going into rehab in the 1990s.
