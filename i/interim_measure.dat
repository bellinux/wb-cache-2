40|$|In the 20 th century, Arbitration {{became one}} {{the most widely}} {{utilized}} form of dispute resolution {{in the field of}} international commerce. The use of Arbitration provides parties with more flexibility. This thesis examines one of the current trends in international arbitration - <b>interim</b> <b>measures.</b> Their purpose {{is to be able to}} react in situations when the proceedings are already pending or even before they actually commenced. They should significantly reduce the risk that the arbitral award may be frustrated or unenforceable. In these situations, it may be justifiable to interfere with parties' relationships. The thesis is focused particularly on the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal to issue <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> and on the role of national courts in this field. In the terms of competence of arbitral tribunals, the legal basis of their jurisdiction and conditions necessary to issue <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> are highlighted. In the case of the role of national courts, the thesis examines their ancillary function (<b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> issued by national courts) as well as their supervisory function (review of the <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> issued by arbitral tribunals). The most important aspect is then the enforcement of <b>interim</b> <b>measures.</b> The very latest trend - emergency arbitrator proceedings - is not excluded. The thesis [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Anyone who {{proves that}} he or she is in a {{situation}} of danger and who is a potential victim of a violation of a right set forth in the American or the European Convention on Human Rights may be protected by <b>interim</b> <b>measures.</b> <b>Interim</b> <b>measures</b> in the human rights systems may be defined as an instrument, the purpose of which is to prevent irreparable harm to persons who are in a situation of extreme gravity and urgency, which a favourable final judgment would therefore not be able to undo. They result in protection offered by the State in compliance with the legally binding order of the Inter-American or European Court on Human Rights. While this legal figure is nowadays applied more and more frequently and in most cases the American and European countries have complied with the order of their respective Court of Human Rights, the question that this contribution would like to answer is what the legal consequences of incompliance are and whether the difference as to the legal basis of the <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> in both human rights systems has influenced the legal effect that the respective Courts have given to non-compliance with the measures. After an overview of the case-law, it will be shown that in fact each regional system has given different legal consequences to the incompliance with its <b>interim</b> <b>measures,</b> but paradoxically, the effects are not directly related to the type of legal instrument in which the <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> are contemplated. The issue is relevant because on the one hand <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> are mostly adopted in dramatic contexts where the life and personal integrity of human beings are endangered and because a survey of the case-law shows that under the European system the cases of incompliance seem to be on the rise, and on the other hand, because it appears that under the Inter-American system there are many cases in which provisional measures have been issued which will be decided soon on the merits, and therefore during the examination of which it will be decided whether the member States have complied or not with the Inter-American Court’s <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> and what consequences incompliance entails...|$|R
5|$|In 1922, as an <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> {{before the}} first {{specially}} designed definitives were ready, a series of contemporary stamps of King George V were overprinted. The unoverprinted stamps were issued and in use in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland between 1912 and 1922 and continued in use in Great Britain and Northern Ireland until 1936. Three printing firms held overprinting contracts: Dollard Printing House Ltd., Alex. Thom & Co Ltd., and Harrison & Sons. In June 1925 the Government Printers, Dublin Castle, obtained the contract and completed all overprinting until 1937, when the final, high-value stamps were issued.|$|E
5|$|Realising {{that his}} advance {{was going to}} be contested, Bowen {{requested}} reinforcements. Consequently, as an <b>interim</b> <b>measure,</b> 59men from Warrego and Yarra were landed under Lieutenant G.A. Hill, until infantry could arrive from Berrima, which was still steaming towards Kabakaul from Karavia Bay. Meanwhile, Bowen pushed on and the Australians were again fired upon by the well concealed Germans and their Melanesian troops, as well as by snipers in the treetops. By 09:30the situation had become grave, and the Australians suffered their first casualty of the war, with Able Seaman Billy Williams mortally wounded. Also among the casualties was the medical officer, Captain Brian Pockley, who died of his wounds in the afternoon after being evacuated to Berrima.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} {{restarted}} in 1981, largely as an <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> while the stealth bomber entered service. This {{led to a}} redesign as the B-1B, which had lower top speed at high altitude of Mach 1.25, but improved low-altitude performance of Mach 0.96. The electronics were also extensively improved during the redesign, and the airframe was improved to allow takeoff with the maximum possible fuel and weapons load. The B-1B began deliveries in 1986 and formally entered service with Strategic Air Command (SAC) as a nuclear bomber in 1986. By 1988, all 100 aircraft had been delivered.|$|E

5|$|When the war ended, {{it was not}} {{expected}} that the inefficient Little Boy design would ever again be required, and many plans and diagrams were destroyed. However, by mid-1946 the Hanford Site reactors were suffering badly from the Wigner effect. Faced {{with the prospect of}} no more plutonium for new cores and no more polonium for the initiators for the cores that had already been produced, Groves ordered that a number of Little Boys be prepared as an <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> until a cure could be found. No Little Boy assemblies were available, and no comprehensive set of diagrams of the Little Boy could be found, although there were drawings of the various components, and stocks of spare parts.|$|E
5|$|As an <b>interim</b> <b>measure,</b> the US {{offered the}} Honest John missile. The offer was accepted, and 120 Honest John {{missiles}} with W31 warheads were supplied in 1960, enough to equip three artillery regiments, the 24th at Nienburg (and later Paderborn), the 39th at Sennelager, and the 50th at Menden, with two batteries each. In addition, each regiment had two batteries of eight-inch M115 howitzers (later replaced by M110 howitzers) with W33 nuclear warheads. A British nuclear artillery round project was cancelled in 1958, and Blue Water met {{the same fate}} on 10 August 1962. The Honest Johns therefore remained in service until 1977. One of the Honest John regiments, the 50th Missile Regiment, Royal Artillery, was then re-equipped with the Lance missile, with its W70 nuclear warhead. The W48 was acquired for the 155mm M109 howitzers. Both it and the W33 would remain in service until 1992. The British Army also considered acquiring the Davy Crockett, but had decided against it by February 1962.|$|E
50|$|The European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France, may grant <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> {{to prevent}} a state from {{carrying}} out an action that could cause irreparable harm before the court has {{had an opportunity to}} hear and/or decide a case. The most common circumstance for when <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> are granted is in cases of extradition or deportation where there is valid evidence that the detainee or asylum seeker would be at risk of torture or the death penalty. Under the court's case law, sending someone to a country where it is reasonable to believe he or she would be tortured amounts to a violation of Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture. <b>Interim</b> <b>measures</b> are temporary and expire once the court has made a final decision. They are also sometimes referred to as precautionary or preliminary measures.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the role the African and Inter-American human rights systems in {{protecting}} the rights of detainees through <b>interim</b> <b>measures.</b> The need for regional human rights to complement protection {{at the national level}} is all the more pronounced when it comes to detainees, because they oft en lack democratic leverage at the national level. While complementing the universal system, regional systems have the added benefit of closer connection and binding judgments. Because the situation of detainees often requires urgent intervention, <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> are required to ensure that detainees do not suffer undue harm. A comparative survey of <b>interim</b> <b>measures</b> in the two regional systems reveals that, while these measures had been issued in both systems, the Inter-American has used them much more frequently. One of the reasons for this difference {{is the fact that the}} Inter-American system does not make the submission of a formal complaint a prerequisite for issuing <b>interim</b> <b>measures.</b> The African Commission should amend its Rules of Procedure to allow for a similar possibility; and it should devote more resources and institutionalize this procedure. Despite the inclusion of collective rights in the African system, the African Commission has infrequently dealt with urgent measures affecting groups of detainees. Both systems suffer from some defects. There is a lack of substantiated reasoning in decisions dealing with <b>interim</b> <b>measures,</b> especially when requests are rejected; information is not made available systematically about the fate of all requests for interim measures; and a lack of compliance besets both systems.

5|$|Calshot Castle was {{designed}} to protect the Solent, a body of water that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the important port of Southampton. The castle was one of four forts that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord Admiral, and William Paulet decided to build to improve the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Hurst. Calshot was constructed on the narrow Calshot Spit, overlooking the deep-water channel running through into Southampton. Temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an <b>interim</b> <b>measure,</b> but the castle itself was built quickly and finished by the end of 1540. It probably reused stone and lead from Bealieu and Netley abbeys, which had recently been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E

This was to be only an <b>interim</b> <b>measure,</b> however, since the forces that withdrew to Huế and Chu Lai would then be sea-lifted to Da Nang by the navy. The president then stunned the general by announcing he misinterpreted his previous orders: The old imperial capital of Huế was not to be abandoned. Making matters worse, Trưởng discovered that his force was to be reduced by the removal of the Marine Division.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} tanks to equip {{armoured}} units led the War Cabinet {{to approve the}} manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940. Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943, but none were used in action. Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas. A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941, while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942, and these {{proved to be the}} most suitable type for jungle warfare. A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign. The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee. Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions, but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas, they did not see action. An Australian scout car known as the Dingo was produced as an <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944. The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, No.82 Wing's Canberras were {{slated for}} {{possible}} bombing and reconnaissance tasks against Indonesian forces under Operation Handover, a little-publicised contingency plan {{put into effect}} during the Indonesia–Malaysia Konfrontasi, although no combat ensued. No.2 Squadron Canberras saw extensive action in the Vietnam War from 1967 to 1971, {{under the control of}} the USAF's 35th Tactical Fighter Wing. The Canberras flew almost 12,000 sorties and delivered over 76,000 pounds of bombs, for the loss of two aircraft to enemy action, and gained a high reputation for their accuracy. No.1OCU was made independent of No.82 Wing in April 1968; its sole purpose from then until its disbandment in June 1971 was to supply trained crews to No.2 Squadron in Vietnam. Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons effectively ceased operations in 1968, while their crews underwent conversion to the General Dynamics F-111C swing-wing bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Between 1970 and 1973, as an <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> pending the delayed delivery of the F-111, Nos.1 and 6 Squadrons flew leased F-4E Phantoms; meanwhile No.2 Squadron continued to operate the Canberra, mainly for aerial survey work in Australia and Indonesia, until disbanding in 1982. The Air Force retained the option to purchase the Phantoms if the F-111C program was cancelled. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and was highly regarded by its RAAF crews.|$|E
5|$|No.1 Squadron re-equipped with Canberra Mk.20s after {{returning}} to Australia. The RAAF's first jet bomber, the Canberra was subsonic but had long range and was highly manoeuvrable. It had been procured partly for its capacity to deliver nuclear weapons, an ordnance option the government seriously contemplated but never acquired. Initially the Canberra's envisaged mission profile was medium-to-high-altitude area bombing but its primitive bombsight and light load made this a dubious proposition, and by mid-1961 crews were training in low-level army cooperation tactics. No.1 Squadron was awarded successive Gloucester Cups for its proficiency in 1959–60 and 1960–61. As of January 1962, its strength was eight aircraft and 53 personnel, including 18 officers. The unit effectively ceased operations in 1968, to begin converting to the General Dynamics F-111C supersonic bomber, which was expected to enter service soon afterwards. Already controversial owing to its escalating cost, the F-111 program was heavily delayed by airworthiness concerns related to its swing-wing technology. In September 1970, as an <b>interim</b> <b>measure</b> while awaiting delivery of the F-111, No.1 Squadron relinquished its Canberras for leased McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantoms, which it operated until June 1973. Although the Phantom had a multi-role capability, the RAAF employed it as a strike aircraft to maintain compatibility with the proposed F-111 mission profile. One of No.1 Squadron's Phantoms was lost with its crew of two in June 1971, the only fatalities and hull loss of the 24 aircraft leased to the RAAF. Though not as sophisticated an aircraft as the F-111, the Phantom was a significant advance over the Canberra, and well regarded by its Australian crews.|$|E
