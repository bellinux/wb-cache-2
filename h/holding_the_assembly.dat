50|$|The first delay for <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> {{occurred}} due to {{the lack}} of preparation on behalf of the Election Commission as well as the seven parties that were at the helm of the government. The second delay, on 5 October 2007, occurred because the Maoists demanded that a republic be declared before the election and that a fully proportional system be used in the election instead of a mixed system. A compromise was agreed to on 4 November: the election would use a fully proportional system, but the republic would only be declared immediately after the Constituent Assembly election.|$|E
5000|$|Soldering {{operations}} can {{be performed}} with hand tools, one joint at a time, or en masse on a production line. Hand soldering is typically performed with a soldering iron, soldering gun, or a torch, or occasionally a hot-air pencil. Sheetmetal work was traditionally done with [...] "soldering coppers" [...] directly heated by a flame, with sufficient stored heat in {{the mass of the}} soldering copper to complete a joint; gas torches (eg, butane or propane) or electrically-heated soldering irons are more convenient. All soldered joints require the same elements of cleaning of the metal parts to be joined, fitting up the joint, heating the parts, applying flux, applying the filler, removing heat and <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> still until the filler metal has completely solidified. Depending on the nature of flux material used and the application, cleaning of the joint may be required after it has cooled.|$|E

The discussion is divided into two parts: the first is devoted to the investigation of the very notion of assembly, the second to the analysis of the topic of classification of assemblies – {{from the perspective of the}} form of decision of an administrative authority regarding the permissibility of <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly.</b> Following this criterion, assemblies are divided into ones which only require notification and the silent acceptance of the administrative organ, spontaneous assemblies which do not require notification, assemblies which require prior permission, and finally assemblies in the case of which it is necessary to agree on the time and place of <b>holding</b> <b>the</b> <b>assembly</b> with the operator of the road...|$|E

An unmet challenge is the construction of polymeric materials that, like nature's tubulin, are simultaneously reversible and capable of useful physical tasks.

Most of these theologians had retained their positions in the Church during the tenure of William Laud. Some had been ejected from their churches or cited by ecclesiastical courts for their views.

25|$|Ideol’s {{engineers}} have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation {{based on a}} central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations.

This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology and planned to be built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and installed by mid-2017 {{off the coast of}} Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV).

50|$|It is, therefore, {{counterproductive}} {{to suspend}} penetrants from <b>the</b> drywall <b>assembly</b> during a fire test.
