5|$|According to Doctor of Legal Sciences Vladimir Ovchinsky, {{regional}} differences in forensic psychiatric expert reports are striking. For example, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> of Russia, 8 or 9 {{percent of all}} examinees are pronounced sane; in other regions up to 75 percent of all examinees are pronounced sane. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> less than 2 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics; in other regions up to 80 percent of examinees are declared schizophrenics.|$|E

5|$|Another {{effect of}} the common European {{currency}} is that differences in prices—in particular in price levels—should decrease because {{of the law of}} one price. Differences in prices can trigger arbitrage, i.e., speculative trade in a commodity across borders purely to exploit the price differential. Therefore, prices on commonly traded goods are likely to converge, causing inflation <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> and deflation in others during the transition. Some evidence of this has been observed in specific eurozone markets.|$|E

5|$|East Antarctica {{is a cold}} {{region with}} a ground base above sea level and {{occupies}} most of the continent. This area is dominated by small accumulations of snowfall which becomes ice and thus eventually seaward glacial flows.

However, increased ice outflow has been suggested <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the People's Republic of China, Mongolian is a co-official {{language}} with Mandarin Chinese <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions,</b> notably the entire Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The traditional alphabet {{has always been}} used there, although Cyrillic was considered briefly before the Sino-Soviet split.

5|$|Ocean {{circulation}} patterns have {{a strong}} influence on climate and weather and, in turn, the food supply of both humans and other organisms. Scientists have warned of the possibility, {{under the influence of}} climate change, of a sudden alteration in circulation patterns of ocean currents that could drastically alter the climate <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> of the globe.

5000|$|An {{example of}} a moment measure is the first moment measure of a point process, often called mean measure or {{intensity}} measure, which gives the expected or average number of points of the point process being located <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>region</b> of space.

Each Noh {{school has}} its own {{permanent}} theatre, such as Kanze Noh Theater (Tokyo), Hosho Noh Theater (Tokyo), Kongo Noh Theater (Kyoto), and Nara Komparu Noh Theater (Nara). Additionally, there are various prefectural and municipal theatres located throughout Japan that present touring professional companies and local amateur companies. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions,</b> unique regional Noh such as Ogisai Kurokawa Noh have developed to form schools independent from five traditional schools.|$|E
5|$|Seasons {{may play}} a role <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions.</b> A {{dramatic}} change in colour and texture is created by seasonal snowy conditions in northern latitudes, necessitating repainting of vehicles and separate snow oversuits. The Eastern and northern European countries have a tradition for separate winter uniforms rather than oversuits. During the Second World War, the Waffen-SS went a step further, developing reversible uniforms with separate schemes for summer and autumn, as well as white winter oversuits.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{factorial}} moment {{measure of a}} point process coincides with its first moment measure or intensity measure, which gives the expected or average number of points of the point process located <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>region</b> of space. <b>In</b> general, {{if the number of}} points <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>region</b> is considered as a random variable, then the moment factorial measure of this region is the {{factorial moment}} of this random variable. [...] Factorial moment measures completely characterize a wide class of point processes, which means they can be used to uniquely identify a point process.|$|R

5|$|Several {{species have}} a hot to very acrid taste {{and can cause}} {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms. Despite this, such species are eaten <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions,</b> e.g. Lactarius torminosus in Finland or Russia. Often, they are parboiled or pickled to make them palatable, and sometimes, they are used as spice, for example Russula emetica in Eastern Europe. Some species are however truly poisonous: the East Asian and North American Russula subnigricans causes rhabdomyolysis and is potentially lethal, and Lactarius turpis from Eurasia contains a mutagenic substance.|$|E
5|$|The {{range of}} the North American river otter has been {{significantly}} reduced by habitat loss, beginning with the European colonization of North America. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions,</b> though, their population is controlled to allow the trapping and harvesting of otters for their pelts. River otters are very susceptible {{to the effects of}} environmental pollution, which is a likely factor in the continued decline of their numbers.

5|$|The vernacular {{architecture}} of Scotland, as elsewhere, {{made use of}} local materials and methods. The homes of the poor were usually of very simple construction, and were built by groups of family and friends. Stone is plentiful throughout Scotland and was a common building material, employed in both mortared and dry stone construction. As in English {{vernacular architecture}}, where wood was available, crucks (pairs of curved timbers) were often used to support the roof. With a lack of long span structural timber, the crucks were sometimes raised and supported on the walls. Walls were often built of stone, and could have gaps filled with turf, or plastered with clay. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions</b> wattled walls filled in with turf were employed, sometimes on a stone base. Turf-filled walls were not long-lasting, {{and had to be}} rebuilt perhaps as often as every two or three years. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions,</b> including the south-west and around Dundee, solid clay walls were used, or combinations of clay, turf and straw, rendered with clay or lime to make them weatherproof. Different regions used turfs, or thatch of broom, heather, straw or reeds for roofing.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} on 22 June, approximately 1.8million French soldiers were in captivity; a figure representing roughly 10 percent of the total adult male population of France at the time. One of the terms of the Compiègne Armistice was that French prisoners would remain in German custody {{until the end of the}} war which was thought to be imminent. French prisoners came from all backgrounds, regions and civilian occupations within France and also included a substantial number of soldiers from the French colonial empire. Nevertheless, approximately a third of all French prisoners of war were French farmers or peasants and, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions,</b> the total proportion of agricultural workers captured was much higher. This created labour shortages in many civilian occupations, particularly agriculture which was largely unmechanised.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with the}} {{situation}} after the redistribution of population {{as a result of}} the clearances and the industrial revolution that began in the eighteenth century, the population was evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay. Most of the early modern population, in both the Lowlands and Highlands, was housed in small hamlets and isolated dwellings. One result of the Little Ice Age was the abandonment of marginal land in the early part of the period, as it became impossible to sustain agriculture <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>regions,</b> particularly in the uplands, but new settlements were created {{as a result of the}} opening up of hunting reserves like Ettrick Forest and less desirable low-lying land was also settled, often incorporating features into their names such as bog, marsh and muir.|$|E
