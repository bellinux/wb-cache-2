And sometimes he'd go berserk with those who disagreed with him. He didn't have, let us say, the delicacies of negotiation.|$|E
500|$|Science {{fiction writer}} and U.S. Navy officer L. Ron Hubbard soon {{moved into the}} Parsonage; he and Parsons became close friends. Parsons wrote to Crowley that {{although}} Hubbard had [...] "no formal training in Magick he has {{an extraordinary amount of}} experience and understanding in the field. From some of his experiences I deduce he is direct touch with some higher intelligence, possibly his Guardian Angel.... He is the most Thelemic person <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> and is in complete accord with our own principles." ...|$|E
500|$|Scottish {{mezzo-soprano}} Karen Cargill summarized [...] "Maria Radner, {{my beloved}} friend" [...] in The Guardian: [...] "She {{was the most}} generous-spirited person <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> Hysterical laughter, an obsession with all things Burberry, unadulterated passion for Bayern Munich and the warmest of hugs were things you could always be guaranteed of when you were with her. Her son and partner were her whole life." [...] Further down Cargill qualified the latter, in that [...] "Music was Maria's entire life until she met her partner and they had their son." ...|$|E

500|$|For the {{ten years}} {{following}} World War I, Troy Middleton would be either an instructor or {{a student in the}} succession of military schools that Army officers attend during their careers. [...] Middleton arrived in Columbus, Georgia with strong praise from his superiors, and would soon get his efficiency report, in which Brigadier General Benjamin Poore of the 4th Division wrote of him, [...] "The best all-around officer I have yet seen. Unspoiled by his rapid promotion from captain in July to colonel in October; and made good in every grade. He gets better results in a quiet unobtrusive way than any officer <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> Has a wonderful grasp of situations and a fine sense of proportion." ...|$|E
500|$|After Barack Obama {{was elected}} as U.S. Senator of Illinois, Lu joined Obama's office in early 2005 as {{legislative}} director. Lu developed a strong admiration for Obama, {{of whom he}} said, [...] "With his quick and incisive mind, Obama is the most intelligent person that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> (in the political arena)." [...] As legislative director, Lu led a 15-person group and was responsible for overseeing the drafting of all legislation and advising Obama on votes and policy decisions. When weighing difficult votes, Obama had Lu and his other staff members assemble together and argue about the issue in front of him. David Mendell, a Chicago Tribune reporter and Obama biographer, said Lu was among the [...] "moderate voices in this atmosphere of smart young staffers." [...] Lu advised Obama to {{vote in favor of}} the Military Commissions Act of 2006 because he felt it would have been politically wiser to support it, but Obama ultimately voted against it.|$|E
500|$|Cognizant {{that there}} is [...] "life after baseball", in 2013, Hollands {{enrolled}} at the Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising to earn a degree merchandise marketing. He notes that fashion has permeated his life; {{he grew up in}} the Bay Area of California, where fashion is [...] "everywhere and a part of everyone's life in some way or another", and worked at an Abercrombie & Fitch store while in high school. He also frequently counsels his teammates on appropriate fashion choices. Fellow reliever Jake Diekman characterized Hollands as having a [...] "really good personality for the bullpen ... I don't know, he just hangs out, he's probably the most chill human being <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in my life." [...] He has even instructed fellow relievers on techniques for folding shirts. Despite earning [...] during his first season, Hollands takes the subway to Citizens Bank Park for Phillies' games.

60|$|He {{really was}} the shyest man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> It seemed to hurt him to be spoken to. However, he was the boss, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> to humour him, so I didn't say any more.|$|R

500|$|Michael begins {{leaving the}} office early, refusing to explain {{himself to his}} {{employees}} and lying to Jan of his whereabouts. In reality, Michael has been combating heavy debt by working as a telemarketer until 1 a.m. At the office the next day, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak) arrives to find Michael unprepared for a presentation due to his moonlighting, and orders Michael to quit his night job or be fired from Dunder Mifflin. At the same time, Kelly Kapoor (Mindy Kaling) flaunts {{the fact that she}} is now dating Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) in an attempt to make Ryan jealous. They get into a fight later where Kelly says to the documentary crew, [...] "Darryl Philbin is the most complicated man <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> I mean, who says exactly what they're thinking? What kind of game is that?" [...] After quitting his telemarketing job, Michael desperately attempts to come up with money.|$|E
500|$|Gagnon's {{fascination with}} Peru and the Asháninka [...] began after World War II, {{when he heard}} a bishop give a talk about them. He then worked for three years in a shoe factory and {{restaurant}} in New Hampshire to save money to allow him to visit Lima. In 1948, he came to Peru, entered the Franciscan order, and took the name Mariano. Gagnon was ordained a priest in 1957, and spent three years working with those who spoke Cocama, an indigenous language of Peru. He said of the people that he served, [...] "They are the most virtuous people <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> They never lie and have great respect for personal property. Their language is very sharp. There is no word for 'maybe' in Campa." [...] He also observed that they did not chew coca leaves and were not prone to sharing food and drink, which had been a major cause of rampant tuberculosis. There was also a high infant mortality rate. By 1969, he had established two missions and began work on a third.|$|E
500|$|The Smiths {{involved}} themselves {{heavily in}} local affairs. Jock chaired the village management board and commanded the Selukwe Company of the Southern Rhodesia Volunteers; he {{also became a}} founder member of the Selukwe Freemasons' Lodge and President of the town's football and rugby clubs. Agnes, who became informally known as [...] "Mrs Jock", established and ran the Selukwe Women's Institute. Both won the MBE (at different times) for their services to the community. [...] "My parents strove to instil principles and moral virtues, the {{sense of right and}} wrong, of integrity, in their children," [...] Ian Smith wrote in his memoirs. [...] "They set wonderful examples to live up to." [...] He considered his father [...] "a man of extremely strong principles"—"one of the fairest men <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> and that is the way he brought me up. He always told me that we're entitled to our half of the country and the blacks are entitled to theirs." [...] Raised on the frontier of the British Empire in the UK's youngest settler colony, Smith and his generation of white Rhodesians grew up with a reputation for being [...] "more British than the British", something in which they took great pride.|$|E

2500|$|Longtime friend, eight-time co-star and on-again, off-again romance Joan Crawford concurred, stating on David Frost's TV show in 1970 that [...] "he was a king {{wherever}} he went.

2500|$|Schmierer {{expressed}} {{shock at}} the bill, telling The New York Times that, although he outlined how homosexuals could change to heterosexual in the March 2009 conference, his involvement {{was limited to}} giving seminars to Africans about better parenting skills: [...] " [...] horrible, absolutely horrible... Some of the nicest people <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> are gay people." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coward {{wrote the}} {{following}} to Hector Bolitho, her biographer: [...] "she wastes no time on personal inhibitions or inferiority complexes. In fact, she {{takes off her}} coat and gets down to {{the job of the}} moment with less shi-shi than any actress <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met....</b> Despite the fact that for fifty years she has performed a multitude of plays to multitudes of people, she has always contrived to remain the mistress of her tradition rather than allow any tradition to become the mistress of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What of that?" [...] I cried. I {{thought he}} was the most dull, unimaginative man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> <b>I</b> don't know what more <b>I</b> would <b>have</b> said, but the much-belated Hamilton came in just then and took his usual seat. So I dropped into a mumble.|$|R
5000|$|Rondal Partridge, son {{of famous}} {{photographer}} Imogen Cunningham, summarized Dody as being [...] "the most focused person <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> She was quick-thinking; {{she knew the}} 'who, what, when and where' of photographic composition and she knew where the rainbow was... and she went after it." ...|$|R
6000|$|I said I was not {{shocked by}} their unreality. They seemed the least {{affected}} people <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> [...] "And {{are they really}} so extravagant?"

2500|$|I was on {{the verge}} of {{painting}} the Portrait of Jacques Nayral. He was to become my brother-in-law, and was one of the most sympathetic men <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> A strange lad, a little surprising on first encounter - both disturbing because of his sharp use of irony and also attractive because of a generosity that left him as vulnerable as a child. The first time I met him was at President Bonjean's house at Villepreux-les-Clayes, near Versailles, during a dinner which brought together the committee of that 'Villa Medicis Libre' which, as I said before, had been founded by Alexandre Mercereau. From that time onwards, we saw each other often and became friends.|$|E
2500|$|Upon the book's release, {{some readers}} viewed several {{excerpts}} as being {{highly critical of}} U.S. President George W. Bush, {{considered by many to}} be a close friend. [...] For example, Fox wrote that Bush was [...] "the cockiest guy <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in my life," [...] and claimed that he was surprised that Bush had ever made it to the White House. [...] Later, in an interview with Larry King, Fox explained that this was a misunderstanding and that what he meant by calling George W. Bush [...] "cocky" [...] was to say he was [...] "confident." [...] Fox also referred to Bush in his autobiography as a [...] "windshield cowboy," [...] due to Bush's apparent fear of a horse Fox offered him to ride.|$|E
2500|$|Branson {{has stated}} {{in a number}} of {{interviews}} that he has been much influenced by non-fiction books. He most commonly mentions Nelson Mandela's autobiography, Long Walk to Freedom, explaining that Mandela was [...] "one of the most inspiring men <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> and had the honour to call my friend." [...] Owing to his interest in humanitarian and ecological issues, Branson also lists Al Gore's best-selling book, An Inconvenient Truth, and The Revenge of Gaia by James Lovelock amongst his favourites. According to Branson's book, Screw It, Let's Do It: Lessons in Life, he is also a fan of Jung Chang's Wild Swans and Antony Beevor's Stalingrad. In fiction, Branson has long admired the character Peter Pan, and in 2006 he founded Virgin Comics LLC, stating that Virgin Comics will give [...] "a whole generation of young, creative thinkers a voice".|$|E
6000|$|... "How dreadful! I do {{not know}} any one that I pity so much as I do her. I {{was in the house}} with her some time, and she gave me the idea of being the most unhappy woman <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> with. Don't you think that she is very unhappy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly! At Blakely we were {{on terms}} of the most {{intimate}} friendship. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> grown to like and respect him more than any man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> <b>I</b> don't know exactly why I should take you so far into my confidence, but I am inclined to do so.

2500|$|In April 1973 {{progressive}} liberal {{members of}} the House paid tribute to Mrs. Lucy Lopez. John J. Mershon, representative from Cloudcroft, introduced a memorial honoring Mrs. Lopez. [...] He belonged to the conservative group that was usually opposed to the Mama Lucy Gang, so his introduction was a gesture of unity. Richard Carbajal, representative from Belen, spoke first. He said [...] "Mama Lucy is the most generous person <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> She was so good to us and helped most of us make it through college. She has a heart as big as she is." [...] He said [...] "If she went bankrupt {{it was because of}} the big heart she had. Students like me, broke, could go to Mama Lucy and want to charge a meal. She never once flinched. You never walked away hungry if you knew Mama Lucy." ...|$|E
2500|$|Goldwater was grief-stricken by the {{assassination}} of Kennedy and was greatly disappointed that his opponent in 1964 would not be Kennedy but instead his Vice President, former Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas. Goldwater disliked Johnson (saying he, [...] "....used every dirty trick in the bag."), and Richard M. Nixon of California (whom he later called, [...] "...the most dishonest individual <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> in my life."). After Goldwater again became a senator, he urged Nixon to resign {{at the height of}} the Watergate scandal, warning that fewer than ten senators would vote against conviction if Nixon were impeached by the House of Representatives. The term [...] "Goldwater moment" [...] has since been used to describe situations when influential members of Congress disagree so strongly with a president from their own party that they openly oppose him.|$|E
2500|$|General Macready (in 1919) thought French [...] "one of {{the most}} lovable men <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> … one {{of the most}} loyal and true-hearted {{individuals}} you are ever likely to come across". Field Marshal Chetwode, reflecting on the hostility between Haig and his former patron French, wrote that [...] "French was a man who loved life, laughter and women … a man who might have done big things in open warfare. He was a lucky general and inspired the greatest confidence in his troops" [...] and that Haig was his opposite in most of these respects. Churchill (in Great Contemporaries) wrote that French was [...] "a natural soldier" [...] who lacked Haig’s attention to detail and endurance, but who had [...] "deeper military insight" [...] and [...] "would never have run the British army into the same long drawn-out slaughters". Seely and Esher thought highly of him. Haldane thought he had [...] "been a great Commander-in-Chief, a soldier of the first order, who held the Army as no other could". Lloyd George praised him as [...] "a far bigger man" [...] than Haig and regretted that he [...] "had fallen by the daggers of his own colleagues", although perhaps as an ally against Haig in 1916–18.|$|E
60|$|Before {{the advance}} {{commenced}} I visited Butler at Fort Monroe. This {{was the first}} time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> him.

They were very much such as I intended to direct, and as I did direct (*24), in writing, before leaving.|$|R
60|$|We {{sat down}} again, side by side. He was the strangest {{compound}} of anomalies <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met</b> with. Throw him {{into one of}} those passions in which he flamed out so easily--and you would have said, This is a tiger. Wait till he had cooled down again to his customary mild temperature--and you would have said with equal truth, This is a lamb.|$|R
6000|$|As {{he entered}} the room I recall {{remarking}} that he was possessed of the supremest confidence of any man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>met.</b> Mrs. Manners he greeted in one way, Mr. Marmaduke in another, and Mr. Walpole in still another. To Comyn it was [...] "Hello, Jack," [...] as he walked by him. Each, as it were, had been tagged with a particular value.|$|R
