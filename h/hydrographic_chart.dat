6000|$|In {{geography}} {{the principal}} novelties are {{the identification of}} certain ruined cities mentioned by Ptolemy, and the [...] "Harrahs" [...] or plutonic centres scattered over the seaboard and the interior. I venture to solicit the attention of experts for my notes on El-Harrah, that great volcanic chain whose fair proportions have been so much mutilated by its only explorer, the late Dr. Wallin. Beginning with Damascan Trachonitis, and situated, in the parallel of north lat. 28 degrees, about sixty direct {{miles east of the}} Red Sea, it is reported to subtend the whole coast of North-Western Arabia, between El-Muwaylah (north lat. 27 degrees 39') and El-Yambu' (north lat. 24 degrees 5'). Equally noticeable are the items of information concerning the Wady Hamz, the [...] "Land's End" [...] of Egypt, and the most important feature of its kind in North-Western Arabia. Its name, wrongly given by Wallin, is unknown to the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Chart,</b> and to the erudite pages of my friend Professor Aloys Sprenger, who, however, suspects with me that it may be the mouth of the celebrated Wady el-Kura. For further topographical details the reader is referred to the [...] "Itineraries" [...] of the Expedition, offered to the Royal Geographical Society of London.|$|E
6000|$|Father Merolla (1682), {{who visited}} it from [...] "Angoij," [...] our [...] "Cabinda," [...] speaks {{of it as}} a pretty large island, {{tributary}} to the Mani-Congo, extremely populous, well supplied with provisions, and outlaid by islets belonging to the Count of Sonho. Tuckey's Embomma was an inland banza or town, and the site of the factories was called Market Point; the Expedition map and the <b>hydrographic</b> <b>chart</b> term it Loombee, the latter being properly the name of a large quitanda (market) lying two miles to the north-west. Early in the present century it is described as a village of a hundred huts, opposite which trading vessels anchored under charge of the [...] "Fuka or king's merchant;" [...] no market was held there, lest, in case of dispute, the royal person might suffer. Although the main features of our maps are still correct, there have been great changes in the river-bed between Porto da Lenha and Boma, especially about the latter place, which should be transferred from its present site to Lumbi. The broad Chisalla Creek, which Mr. Maxwell calls Logan, between the northern bank and the island [...] "Booka Embomma," [...] is now an arm only 200 feet wide. In fact all the bank about Boma, like the lower delta, urgently calls for re-surveying.|$|E
6000|$|We set out {{at seven}} a.m. {{on the next}} day, when an Azyab or south-easterly wind was promised by the damp air, the slaty sea, and the gloomy nimbi on the hill-tops. A small party landed after two hours' steaming, in search of quartz, which proved to be chloritic {{sandstones}} and limestones. In the broad valley they found a few Muzayni families, with their camels, sheep, and goats. These unfortunates had no tents, sleeping under the trees; they were desperate beggars, and, although half-starved, they asked a napoleon for a kid, declaring that such was its price at the quarantine station of Tor. Here the errors of the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Chart,</b> which have been copied literally by the latest and best popular books such as Professor Palmer's [...] "Desert of the Exodus," [...] began to excite our astonishment. For instance, Ras Kusayr ("the Short One") becomes Ras Arser--what a name for a headland! A good survey will presently become a sine quâ non. Unfortunately Ahmed Kaptán was suffering so much that I could not ask him to make solar observations; {{while the rest of}} us had other matters in hand. It was a great disappointment, where so much useful work remains to be done.|$|E
50|$|The {{idea for}} the survey {{probably}} arose while he {{was working as a}} Customs official in Holyhead, where he would have come into contact with many seafarers.

6000|$|The <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Chart</b> {{gives the}} Mountain {{a maximum of}} nine thousand[EN#17] feet, evidently a {{clerical}} error often repeated--really those Admiralty gentleman are too incurious: Wellsted, who surveyed it, remarks (II. X.), [...] "The height of the most elevated peak {{was found to be}} 6500 feet, and it obtained from us the appellation of Mowilabh High Peak"'--when there are native names for every head. We had been convinced that the lesser is the true measure, by our view from the Hismá plateau, 3800 feet above sea-level. Again, the form, the size, and the inclination of the noble massif are wrongly laid down by the hydrographers. It is a compact block, everywhere rising abruptly from low and sandy watercourses, and completely detached from its neighbours by broad Wadys--the Surr to the north and east, while southwards run the Kuwayd and the Zahakán. The huge long-oval prism measures nineteen and a half by five miles (= ninety-seven and a half square miles of area); and its lay is 320° (mag.), thus deflected 40° westward of the magnetic north. The general appearance, seen in profile from the west, is a Pentedactylon, a central apex, with two others on each side, tossed, as it were, to the north and south, and turning, like chiens de faïence, their backs upon one another.|$|E
6000|$|The survey {{soundings}} {{were not}} finished till nearly eight a.m. (March 23rd), {{when the old}} corvette swung round on her heel; and, with the black hills of Salbah to port, resumed her rolling, rollicking way southwards. Her only ballast consisted of some six hundred conical shot, or twelve tons for a ship of eight hundred. After one hour of steaming (= seven miles) we passed the green mouth of the Wady Antar, in whose Istabl ("stable"), or upper valley-course, the pilgrimage-caravan camps. It drains a small inland feature to the north-east, the true [...] "Jebel Antar," [...] which the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Chart</b> has confounded with the great block, applying, moreover, the term Istabl to the height instead of the hollow. This Jebel Libn, along which we are now steaming, is a counterpart on a small scale, a little brother, of the Shárr, measuring 3733 instead of 6000 to 6500 feet. We first see from the north a solid block capped with a mural crown of three peaks. When abreast of us the range becomes a tall, fissured, and perpendicular wall: this apical comb, bluff to the west, reposes upon a base sloping, at the angle of rest, to the environing sandy Wady. To complete the resemblance, even the queer [...] "Pins" [...] are not wanting; and I should expect to find in it all the accidents of the giant of El-Muwaylah.|$|E
6000|$|Now he {{has another}} {{opportunity}} of doing valuable service, {{none of these}} positions having been established by observations, and of showing travellers how topography should be worked. He has before him for correction the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>chart,</b> which pretends to nothing within the Coast, and the 'River Ankobra and Tarquah(!) Gold Mines,' printed in 1878 by Captain Louis Wyatt, then District-commissioner for Axim. This first attempt at a regular survey is meritorious for an amateur; {{but of course it}} cannot compare with the produce of a scientific and experienced naval surveyor. We had Lieut. Jeekel, before alluded to, but his scale, 1:250,000, is too small for details. I did not see, till long after our return from this excursion, the then unfinished map by M. Paulus Dahse, a veteran West-Coaster, who has spent years in travelling through the interior. My fellow-voyager also was the first to show me the various cartes printed and published by the late M.

6000|$|We set out at 4.30 p.m. (March 24th); and steamed due west till we had {{rounded the}} {{northern}} head of El-Raykhah, a long low island which, lying west-south-west of El-Wijh, may act breakwater in that direction. Then we went south-west, and passed to port the white rocks of Mardu'nah Isle, which fronts the Ras el-Ma'llah, capping the ugly reefs and shoals that forbid tall ships to hug {{this section of}} the shore. It is described as a narrow ridge of coralline, broken into pointed masses two to three hundred feet high, whose cliffs and hollows form breeding-places for wild pigeons: the unusually rugged appearance is {{explained by the fact that}} here the [...] "Jinns" [...] amuse themselves with hurling rocks at one another. Before night we had sighted the Ras Kurkumah, so called from its [...] "Curcuma" [...] (turmeric) hue, the yellow point facing the islet-tomb of Shaykh Marbat.[EN#46] Upon this part of the shore, I was told, are extensive ruins as yet unvisited by Europeans, the dangerous Juhaynah being the obstacle. To the south-east towered tall and misty forms, the Gháts of the Tihámat-Jahaníyyah. Northernmost, and prolonging the Libn, that miniature Shárr, is the regular wall of the Jebel el-Ward; then come the peaks and pinnacles of the Jibál el-Safhah; and lastly, the twin blocks El-Rál, between which passes the Egyptian Hajj when returning from El-Medínah.

6000|$|I {{lost all}} {{patience}} with Wellsted,[EN#59] whose blunders concerning the Umm el-Karáyát are really surprising, {{even for a}} sailor on camel-back. He reaches the ruins after ten miles from the fort, when they lie between twelve and thirteen from El-Wijh. He calls the porphyritic trap [...] "dark granite." [...] He makes the grand quartz formation [...] "limestone, of which the materials used for constructing the town (coralline!) {{appear to have been}} chiefly derived." [...] He descends the [...] "caves" [...] with ropes and lights; yet he does not perceive that they are mining shafts and tunnels, puits d'air, adits for the workmen, and pits by which the ore was [...] "brought to grass." [...] And the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Chart</b> is as bad. It locates the inland fort six miles and three-quarters from the anchorage, but the mine is thrust eastwards ten miles and a quarter from the fort; the latter distance being, as has been seen, little more than the former. Moreover, the ruins are placed to the north, when they lie nearly on the same parallel of latitude as El-Wijh. Ahmed Kaptán fixed them, by solar observations, in north lat. 26° 13', so that we made only one mile of southing. It ignores the porphyritic sub-range in which the [...] "Mother of the Villages" [...] lies: and it brings close to the east of it the tall peaks of the Tihámat-Balawíyyah' which, from this point, rise like azure shadows on the horizon. Finally, it corrupts Umm el-Karáyát to Feyrabat. [...] "Impossible, but true!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{southern}} port, [...] "Ginái," [...] {{is formed}} by {{a bend in}} the reef which sweeps round from east to south-west like a scorpion's tail. The natural sea-wall, at once dangerous and safety-giving, protects, to the south and south-east, diabolitos of black rock visible only at high tide: inshore the sickle-shaped breakwater runs by east to south-west, becoming a [...] "sandy hook," [...] and enclosing a basin whose depth ranges from seven to twelve fathoms. Its approach from the south is clean; and the western opening is protected by the tall screen of coast cliffs, the Jebel el-Ginái, whose deep-black porphyritic gorge seemingly prolongs that of Midianite Tayyib Ism. This is a section of the Jibál el-Samghi, the coast-range which extends as far north as the Wady Wati'r. The Dock-port, so useful when the terrible norther blows, has an admirable landmark, visible even from Sináfir Island, and conspicuous at the entrance of the Gulf. Where the sandy slopes of South-Eastern Sinai-land end, appears a large white blot, apparently supporting a block, built, like a bastion, upon a tall hill of porphyritic trap. We called this remnant of material harder than the rest, Burj el-Dahab--"the Tower Hill of Dahab." [...] I have been minute in describing the Golden Harbour: scant justice has been done to it by the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Chart,</b> and it will prove valuable when the Makna' mines are opened. Ahmed Kaptán vainly attempted soundings--he was too ill to work. Wellsted's identification of the site with Ezion-geber (ii. ix.), and the reef with the rock-ledge which wrecked Jehosaphat's fleet, has one great objection--no ruins are known to exist near it.[EN#121] ...|$|E

6000|$|Before {{describing}} the Palace of Sa'íd the Brave, I must devote {{a few lines}} to a notice of the Wady Hamz. The Wady Hamz, which has been mentioned as the southern frontier of Egyptian Midian, and the northern limit of the Ottoman Hejaz, is the most notable feature of its kind upon the North-Western Arabian shore. Yet Wallin has unjustifiably described and inscribed it [...] "Wady Nejd," [...] confusing it with a northern basin, whose mouth, the Salbah (Thalbah), we passed before reaching Sharm Dumayghah. He appears to identify it with the classical Wady el-Kura. Sprenger clean ignores the name, although he mentions its branches; {{and of course it}} is utterly neglected by the <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Chart.</b> This main approach to the Arabian interior is not a fissure, like the vulgar Wadys, but rather an opening where the Gháts, or maritime chain, break to the north and south. Distant one long or two short marches from El-Wijh, its mouth is in north lat. 25° 55'; and it is said to head fifteen days inland, in fact beyond El-Medínah, towards which it curves with a south-easterly bend. It receives a multitude of important secondary valleys; amongst which is the Wady el-Uwaynid, universally so pronounced. I cannot help thinking that this is El-Aúníd of El-Mukaddasi, which El-Idrísí (erroneously?) throws into the sea opposite Nu'ma'n Island. If my conjecture prove true, we thus have a reason why this important line has been inexplicably neglected. Another branch is the Wady el-Is, Sprenger's [...] "Al-Ys" [...] (pp. 28, 29), which he calls [...] "a valley in the Juhaynah country," [...] and makes the northern boundary of that tribe.|$|E
60|$|After a {{cool and}} {{comfortable}} night {{we visited the}} ruins which Bosman calls Casteel Groot Frederiksburg tot Pocquesoe (Prince's). Our <b>Hydrographic</b> <b>Chart</b> has 'old fort Brandenburg,' which is at Cape Threepoints. Others declare {{that it was the}} only good establishment owned by the Elector; and the best authority, Lieut. Jeekel, terms it G Friedrichsburg (Hollandia). I may note that 'Prinsi 'Ollandia' is still the native name. These buildings interest us greatly, because in the coming days of immigration they will serve for hospitals, stores, and barracoons. Ascending a few feet of bushy hill, called in books 'Mamfra,' and once evidently an island, we came upon the eastern flank, three substantial bastions and a cavalier, with masonry knitted by creepers. We then wound round by the southern or sea side, and, turning the angle, made the eastern flank. The gateway, stockade, and belfry shown in Bosman ('Eerste Brief,' 1737) have disappeared; so also has the slave-court, but the double doorway remains. The spacious centre, planted with bananas almost wild, would make a grand garden; the walls are built to stand for ages; and, although the floors of the upper stories have been torn down, there would be no difficulty in restoring them. As steps and stairs are absent, {{it was not possible to}} reach the battlements. These are luxuriant with vegetation, of which I should preserve a portion for shade and coolth. A fine arched cistern now affords a shelter to bats; and a building which appears to be the chapel remains on the northern side. Old iron guns still cumber the embrasures and the ground.|$|E
6000|$|We {{anchored}} for {{the night}} off {{the south side of}} the Zungá chyá Ngombe, in Portuguese Ilha do Boi (Bullock), the Rhinoceros Island of our early charts. It emerges from the waters of the right bank, a mere [...] "ponton" [...] plumed with dark mangroves and streaked with spar-like white trunks. This is probably the [...] "Island of Horses," [...] where the Portuguese, flying from the victorious Hollanders, were lodged and fed by the courteous Count of Sonho; perhaps it is Battel's [...] "Isle Calabes." [...] The place is backed by the Monpanga or Mombang, the [...] "Look-out Islands" [...] of the chart, which has greatly changed since the beginning of the century; the dark mass of mangroves is now apparently part of the northern shore. Almost due south of the Ilha do Boi is the Zungá chyá Kampenzi, whence our word chimpanzee: in the <b>hydrographic</b> <b>chart</b> it is miswritten Zoonga Campendi, and in Tuckey's map, which contradicts his text, [...] "Zoonga Casaquoisa." [...] His [...] "Zoonga Kampenzey," [...] also named [...] "Halcyon Island," [...] appears to be the Draper's Island or the [...] "Monkey Island" [...] of Mr. Maxwell: the latter in modern charts is more to the north-east, that is, above Porto da Lenha, than the former. The Simiads have been killed out; Captain Tuckey going up the river saw upwards of twenty which, but for their tails, might have been mistaken for negroes. Merolla says that wild men and women (gorillas?) have been captured in Sonho, and he carefully distinguishes them from baboons: one of them was presented to a friar of his order, who [...] "bestowed it on the Portuguese governor of Loanda." [...] Chimpanzee Island may be the Zariacacongo of Father Merolla, who makes Cacongo (Great Congo) a large and independent kingdom" [...] lying in the middle between Congo and Loango." [...] He describes Zariacacongo, [...] "none of the smallest, and situate in the midst of the River Zaire." [...] It abounded in all sorts of provisions, was well peopled, consisted of a plain raised eight fathoms above water, and was divided from the kingdom of Congo by a river, over which there was a bridge.|$|E
