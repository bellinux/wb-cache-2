5|$|Not all of {{the monks}} were {{attracted}} by Symeon's zealous approach. Symeon attempted to reform the Byzantine monasteries, where monks had become subservient to the emperor and had acquired large holdings of property, libraries, and art. His writings and teachings were aimed at returning the monasteries to their traditional role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>church,</b> urging the monks {{to take up a}} life of simplicity, asceticism, purity of heart, and constant prayer. The strict monastic discipline for which Symeon aimed upset several monks in the monastery. Symeon also took a more emotional approach to worship, suggesting that a monk shouldn't take the sacrament without tears. The introduction of vegetarian meals, along with other unique practices to instill discipline and humility, also caused some displeasure among the monks.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Christ in pictorial form was highly controversial <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>church.</b> From the 5th century onward, flat painted icons became {{popular in the}} Eastern Church. The Byzantine Iconoclasm acted {{as a barrier to}} developments in the East, but by the ninth century, art was permitted again. The Protestant Reformation brought renewed resistance to imagery, but total prohibition was atypical, and Protestant objections to images have tended to reduce since the 16th century. Although large images are generally avoided, few Protestants now object to book illustrations depicting Jesus. The use of depictions of Jesus is advocated by the leaders of denominations such as Anglicans and Catholics and is a key element of the Eastern Orthodox tradition.|$|E

It was during this period that he began to participate in the discussions of the Anglican–Roman Catholic International Commission (ARCIC); {{he was a member of}} the commission 1969–81 and again 1983–90. his early Evangelical sympathies having been tempered over time, helped by his friendship with Edward Yarnold, Master of Campion Hall. He was a master of the Anglican approach of producing statements capable of a range of interpretations to enable common ground to be reached, this worked well for simpler historical differences, but did not always impress the Roman Catholic members of the commission when it came to questions of ecclesiology and church authority. He was also able to use his historical background to put forward summaries of early church positions on a variety of subjects, and he had a true desire to establish consensus on the basis of the principles revealed by this research. Although his scholarly output suffered from the pressures on his time, he was editor of Oxford Early Christian Texts (from 1970), and was able to work on two major monographs, Priscillian of Avila: the occult and the charismatic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> (published 1976) and Boethius: the consolations of music, logic, theology and philosophy (published 1981).

25|$|Scholars {{agree that}} the Gospel of Mark was not written {{by any of the}} Apostles, but by some {{insignificant}} figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>church.</b> Notwithstanding its shortcomings, it was probably included in the Canon because the Early Church Fathers believed it was a reliable account of the life of Jesus of Nazareth.|$|E

25|$|From {{this point}} until their baptisms, catechumens are {{dismissed}} after the liturgy {{of the word}} when they attend Mass at the parish at which they had the Rite of Acceptance.

25|$|It is to {{be noted}} that since they {{are not related to}} each other dogmatically, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>Church</b> the Great Lent Fast and the Holy Week Fast were fasted separately.

25|$|Worship can be varied {{for special}} events like baptisms or weddings {{in the service}} or {{significant}} feast days. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>early</b> <b>church,</b> Christians and those yet to complete initiation would separate for the Eucharistic part of the worship.

25|$|The final {{ministry}} in Jerusalem is traditionally called the Passion and begins with Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem {{early in the}} week that includes the Last Supper, and liturgically marked by Holy Week.
