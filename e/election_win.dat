25|$|The first UKIP {{local council}} <b>election</b> <b>win</b> {{occurred}} {{when one of}} its members was elected to South Cambridgeshire District Council in 2000. A number of Conservative, Liberal Democrat, Labour and Independent local councillors in all four constituent nations of the UK defected to UKIP over subsequent years, with the most recent defections to date (May to July 2013) coming from former Conservative councillors in the London Boroughs of Merton, Richmond upon Thames and Havering, and from Labour in Northampton and North-East Lincolnshire. In May 2013, 33 English and one Welsh council held local elections, with UKIP gaining 139 seats {{for a total of}} 147, with significant gains in Lincolnshire, Norfolk and Kent.|$|E
25|$|Topp ran the {{campaign}} war {{room for the}} Alberta New Democratic Party during the 2015 election which propelled the Alberta NDP from only 4 seats in the legislature to a majority of 53 seats, ending 44 years of Progressive Conservative rule and allowing the NDP to form its first ever government in the province's history. Topp {{was in charge of}} messaging and communications. He joined {{the campaign}} in January. Topp drafted speeches, wrote articles countering Tory claims, and approved campaign events. He also subbed for Jim Prentice during practice for the leader's debate. Following the <b>election</b> <b>win,</b> he became the chair of Rachel Notley's transition team into government, working alongside other prominent NDP figures such as Anne McGrath.

25|$|Tony Blair stood down {{as prime}} {{minister}} after 10 years in June 2007, and was succeeded by chancellor Gordon Brown. That autumn, the national media reported that an imminent general election was likely, putting all polling organisations, the press and political parties on an election footing, but he eventually {{announced that he would}} not seek a dissolution. According to many media and political figures, this was because he believed that Labour was likely to lose its majority in a snap general election, even though many opinion polls suggested that a fourth successive <b>election</b> <b>win</b> for Labour was likely, and this would potentially have ensured the Labour government's survival to the end of 2012. Gordon Brown has since maintained that Labour would have won but he did not believe an early election was in the national interest.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} was finally held on 9 April 1992 and the Conservatives won a fourth successive electoral victory, {{even though the}} economy was still in recession {{and most of the}} polls had predicted either a narrow Labour victory or a hung parliament. Major's vigorous campaigning, notably his claim that the UK would have higher prices and higher taxes under a Labour government, was seen to have been crucial in his <b>election</b> <b>win</b> (in which he became the first–and as of 2015, only–Prime Minister to attract 14,000,000 votes in a general election), as was a high-profile campaign by The Sun newspaper against Labour leader Neil Kinnock, who resigned {{in the aftermath of the}} election to be succeeded by John Smith. The Conservative Party also touched upon the issue of immigration, claiming that under Labour, immigration would rise hugely.|$|E
25|$|As {{the night}} wore on, the returns {{in a handful}} of small-to-medium-sized states, {{including}} Wisconsin and Iowa, were extremely close; however, it was the state of Florida that would decide the winner of the election. As the final national results were tallied the following morning, Bush had clearly won a total of 246 electoral votes, while Gore had won 249 votes. Two hundred and seventy votes were needed to win. Two smaller states — Wisconsin (10 electoral votes) and Oregon (7 electoral votes) — were still too close to call. It was Florida (25 electoral votes), however, on which the news media focused its attention. Mathematically, Florida's 25 electoral votes became the key to an <b>election</b> <b>win</b> for either candidate. Although both Wisconsin and Oregon were declared in favor of Gore over the next few days, Florida's statewide vote took center stage because that state's winner would ultimately win the election. The outcome of the election was not known {{for more than a month}} after the balloting ended because of the time required to count and recount Florida's presidential ballots.|$|E

25|$|The City of Christchurch {{by-election}} of 1896 was a by-election held on 13 February 1896 {{during the}} 12th New Zealand Parliament {{in the urban}} seat of the City of Christchurch. The by-election was triggered by the appointment of William Pember Reeves as Agent-General to the United Kingdom. The Liberal Government led by Richard Seddon had trouble finding a suitable candidate and delayed Reeves' resignation {{until the day he}} left his home in Christchurch to take up the London post. Nonetheless, rumours of Reeves' pending resignation had been circulating for a month and candidates were lining up. The Liberal Party candidate who was secured resigned within a week of Reeves' eventual resignation, and a new candidate had to be found. Three candidates contested the election: Richard Molesworth Taylor was the official Liberal Party candidate, Tommy Taylor was a prohibitionist also with liberal views but an ardent opponent of Seddon, and Charles Lewis was the reluctant conservative candidate of the opposition. Being a Liberal Party stronghold, vote splitting between those candidates who held liberal views secured the <b>election</b> <b>win</b> for Lewis, with the Liberal Party candidate coming last.|$|E

500|$|The {{massacre}} {{was a major}} spur for the Canadian {{gun control}} movement. Heidi Rathjen, a student who {{was in one of}} the classrooms Lépine did not enter during the shooting, organized the Coalition for Gun Control with Wendy Cukier. Suzanne Laplante-Edward and Jim Edward, the parents of one of the victims, were also deeply involved. Their activities, along with others, led to the passage of Bill C-68, or the Firearms Act, in 1995, ushering in stricter gun control regulations. These new regulations included requirements on the training of gun owners, screening of firearm applicants, rules concerning gun and ammunition storage and the registration of all firearms. [...] Between 2009 and 2012, survivors of the massacre and their families publicly opposed legislative actions by Stephen Harper's Conservative government aimed at ending the requirement to register non-restricted firearms (commonly referred to as the [...] "long-gun registry"). A bill was narrowly defeated in September 2010, but following their 2011 majority <b>election</b> <b>win,</b> the long-gun registry was abolished by the Harper government in April 2012. The Quebec government subsequently won a temporary injunction, preventing the destruction of the province's gun registry data, and ordering the continued registration of long guns in Quebec. In March 2015, The Supreme Court of Canada ruled against Quebec, clearing the way for the destruction of all registry data.|$|E

Other issues were inflation and mining. As in previous elections, there were instances of candidates making monetary payments and other gifts to lure voters.|$|E

2500|$|John Howard was re-elected {{leader of}} the Liberal party in 1995, and pledged [...] "never, ever" [...] to {{introduce}} the GST. Howard led the Liberal-National Coalition to a large victory in the 1996 federal election. However, before the 1998 election, Howard proposed a GST that would replace all existing sales taxes, as well as applying to all goods and services. At the election, the Howard Government suffered a swing against it of 4.61% at the election, achieving a two-party-preferred vote of only 49.02%, compared with Labor on 50.98%. Nevertheless, the incumbent government retained a majority of seats in the lower house and Howard described the <b>election</b> <b>win</b> as a [...] "mandate for the GST". Lacking a Senate majority, and with Labor opposed {{to the introduction of}} the GST, the government turned to the minor parties such as the Australian Democrats to gain the necessary support to get the necessary legislation through the Senate.|$|E
