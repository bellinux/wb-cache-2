5|$|At this point, both armies {{began to}} draw apart; {{although}} sporadic fighting continued as night fell, by midnight both forces had disengaged completely. Both army councils met; Essex's plan to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> the Royalists seemed feasible, and many Parliamentarians, loathe {{to give up}} the ground they had taken, fully expected the battle to continue. The Royalists, on the other hand, were plagued by poor morale, heavy losses and a lack of supplies, having used 80 of their 90 barrels of gunpowder. Although Rupert argued for the battle to continue, he was out-voted, and the next morning Essex was allowed to bypass the Royalist force without issue and continue his retreat towards London.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry {{intensified}} {{after the}} 1989 San Marino Grand Prix, {{where the two}} drivers had an agreement that neither would get in each other's way to the first corner (cf. 1982 San Marino Grand Prix). At the start, Senna got away in the lead and Prost followed him through the first corner without getting in Senna's way. Gerhard Berger's crash on lap four stopped the race. At the restart, it was Prost this time that got away the better of the two; but Senna forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> Prost in the first corner, breaking the pair's agreement {{at the start of}} the race, leaving the Frenchman furious with Senna. Senna argued it was the restart. Prost himself was angered by McLaren apparently favouring Senna because of Senna's better relationship with engine supplier Honda, so he announced mid-season that he had signed to race for Ferrari the following season.|$|E

5|$|Fernando Alonso {{became the}} first man to win two races in 2012 at the European Grand Prix in Valencia, scoring his first home win since the 2006 Spanish Grand Prix. Starting eleventh, he was forced to {{navigate}} his way through traffic, narrowly avoiding early contact between Bruno Senna and Kamui Kobayashi as Sebastian Vettel broke free of the field to establish a twenty-second lead by the first round of stops. Vettel's lead was quashed when Heikki Kovalainen and Jean-Éric Vergne made contact, triggering the deployment of the safety car to clear debris from the circuit. Alonso found himself third at the restart and pounced on a mistake by second-placed Romain Grosjean to lead the chase against Vettel. Vettel pulled away once more, but his lead was short-lived as he lost drive and his engine shut down on lap 33. Grosjean attempted to challenge Alonso, but was forced out of the race with an alternator problem seven laps later, leaving Alonso in the lead, four seconds clear of Lewis Hamilton and Kimi Räikkönen. As the race entered the final laps, Räikkönen forced <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> Hamilton to secure second place, but Pastor Maldonado's attempts to take third place ended with Hamilton in the barrier and a broken nose for the Williams driver. Maldonado finished tenth, but was given a post-race drive-through penalty and was classified twelfth. Meanwhile, Michael Schumacher and Mark Webber had started to carve their way through the field by virtue of a late pit stop and easily picked off the minor points positions and taking advantage of the Maldonado—Hamilton collision to finish third and fourth behind Alonso and Räikkönen. It was Schumacher's first podium since the 2006 Chinese Grand Prix. Alonso's win cemented a twenty-point lead in the championship, whilst Vettel's retirement relegated him to fourth overall, twenty-six points behind Alonso.|$|E
5|$|Fernando Alonso's luck finally ran out in Japan; {{having spent}} most of the season {{profiting}} from poor results from his rivals when he needed them the most, Alonso was the victim of a dramatic first corner clash, spinning out when he made contact with Kimi Räikkönen and paving the way for his championship rivals to make considerable inroads into his twenty-nine-point championship lead. Mark Webber was also caught up in the opening lap melee when he was hit by Romain Grosjean; Webber was forced to pit straight away, while Grosjean was given a ten-second stop-go penalty for causing yet another first lap incident. Bruno Senna also ran afoul of the stewards, hitting Nico Rosberg whilst trying to avoid Grosjean and Webber and earning a drive-through penalty for his troubles while Rosberg retired on the spot. Sergio Pérez added his name to the growing list of early retirements when he slid off at the hairpin under brakes and into the gravel trap whilst trying to force <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> a struggling Lewis Hamilton. Sebastian Vettel won the race from pole position, having led every lap of the race and setting the fastest lap time in the process to complete his second Grand Chelem. Felipe Massa finished second, his first podium result since the 2010 Korean Grand Prix, whilst Kamui Kobayashi claimed the first podium of his career – and the first podium for a Japanese driver at the Suzuka Circuit since Aguri Suzuki finished third in 1990 – after withstanding late pressure from Jenson Button.|$|E
5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood to show any compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E

[...] He {{advanced}} his own ideas (based on cases he and others had studied) observing how various [...] "passions" [...] may be responsible, such as grief, despair, intense study, and application of the mind; as well as poisons such as opium and mercury. He inveighed against private madhouses run by non-physicians and non-clergymen for profit. Pargeter believed that patients were abused in these houses. He also commented on the popular idea that lunacy was influenced by phases of the moon. He often quoted poetry by Milton, Cowper, and others to describe melancholia in his patients.|$|R

25|$|The safety car was {{withdrawn}} after three laps and racing resumed with Asmer leading the field {{back up to}} speed. Jarvis remained close by as he was hoping to making his move on the following lap at Lisboa corner. As Van Der Zande crossed the start/finish line to continue racing, he attempted to find <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> Kennard. Van Der Zande was unable to get past and ended up drifting into the wall at Lisboa turn while Kennard resumed without trouble. Ho then made a pit stop and retired shortly after. On the fifth lap, Jarvis made his overtaking manoevure on Asmer for the lead by slipstreaming {{onto the back of}} him heading down the main straight and passed the driver around the outside at Lisboa corner. At the same time, Senna managed to find <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> Hülkenberg and started to close the gap to Buurmann. Hülkenberg then tried to line up a passing move on Senna to reclaim the position but lost control of his car and glanced the barriers lining the track at Lisboa corner. Both he and Senna were forced into retirement. Localised yellow flags were waved which neutralised racing in that section of the circuit because of debris scattered across the tarmac surface.|$|E
25|$|After pitting for repairs, Senna worked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> both Williams and the Benettons {{to take a}} three-second victory. However, his altercation with Prost seven laps earlier {{meant he}} had missed the chicane and, {{according}} to FIA and FISA president Jean Marie Balestre, had not completed the lap. It {{is worth noting that}} many drivers in previous races had used the escape roads near chicanes after on-track incidents, as is customary, without receiving penalties. He was disqualified and Nannini revelled in his first grand prix victory. The new Williams FW13s finished second and third, putting them five points ahead of the Ferrari team in the race for second.|$|E

As the Indian, holding tightly to their prisoner's arm, picked <b>his</b> <b>way</b> noiselessly <b>past</b> the open flap, Clarke made a queer noise--half cough, half sneeze--very low, but loud enough to be heard by any one in the tent. Like a flash, Harding threw up his pistol, ready for use. As he did so, his foot tripped on a broken bottle lying {{in front of the}} dark entrance. The pistol did not go off, but Harding, trying wildly to regain his balance, fell with a crash against the tepee.|$|R

He continued (without paying), forced his way through the locks at Harpers Ferry and Lock 5, until Georgetown, where he was served notice for $120 in fees plus $4.08 for the waybill. When he got back to Cumberland, his boat was confiscated until he paid the whole $124.08.|$|E

[...] He is as the child to the full-grown man, into which he hopes to develop in the future life. He [...] "sees as in a glass darkly, but then face to face." [...] He [...] "knows now in part." [...] Then--but not till then--will he [...] "know even as he is known." [...] Nay, more.

Surrey got an early breakthrough by dismissing Craig Spearman, but Kadeer Ali and Ramnaresh Sarwan stuck to the crease, adding 151 for the second wicket.

Peterkin used to say of it that it beat a druggist's shop all to sticks; for whereas {{the first is a}} compound of good and bad, the other is a horrible compound of all that is utterly detestable. And indeed the more I consider it, the more I am struck with the strange mixture of good and evil that exists, not only in the material earth, but in our own natures. In our own Coral Island we had experienced every variety of good that a bountiful Creator could heap on us. Yet {{on the night of the}} storm we had seen how almost, in our case-- and altogether, no doubt, in the case of others less fortunate--all this good might be swept away for ever. We had seen the rich fruit-trees waving in the soft air, the tender herbs shooting upwards under the benign influence of the bright sun; and the next day we had seen these good and beautiful trees and plants uprooted by the hurricane, crushed and hurled to the ground in destructive devastation. We had lived for many months in a clime, for the most part, so beautiful that we had often wondered whether Adam and Eve had found Eden more sweet; and we had seen the quiet solitudes of our paradise suddenly broken in upon by ferocious savages, and the white sands stained with blood and strewed with lifeless forms, yet among these cannibals we had seen many symptoms of a kindly nature. I pondered these things much, and while I considered them there recurred to my memory those words which I had read in my Bible: [...] "The works of God are wonderful, and <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>past</b> finding out." ...|$|R

25|$|On October 1, {{the insurgents}} started to battle in Rancagua {{in an attempt}} to prevent the expeditionaries from taking Santiago, Chile. Maroto, manifesting a disdain for his opponents typical of {{officials}} recently arrived in the Americas, ordered his troops to attack the enemy fortifications without bothering to send in either scouts or guerrillas. The result was that Maroto's Talaveras, bombarded by the volley of shots, were forced to retreat with heavy losses. On the next day, Bernardo O'Higgins managed to make <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>past</b> the royal troops and retreat to the capital, where his opponents entered without resistance a few days later. Whether due to a belief that Maroto had conducted himself clumsily in battle or due to other, unknown reasons, although the list of officials who ought to be promoted after the latest victories sent by Osorio to viceroy Abascal included Maroto's name, the messenger who delivered the list nonetheless had confidential instructions to let Abascal know that Osorio believed that Maroto should not be promoted. When Maroto received word several months later that the list that had been sent to Madrid did not include his name, he lodged the appropriate complaint with Abascal, who had not liked the confusing way of proceeding and ended up finding in Maroto's favor on May 10, 1815, granting him the grade of brigadier, backdated to 8 November 1814.|$|E

Of comprehending absolutely, or perfectly, we are not here to speak; for that the Apostle could not, in this place, as to the thing prayed for, desire: For it is utterly impossible perfectly to know whatsoever is in the breadths, lengths, depths, and heights here spoken of. Whether you call them mercies, judgments, or the ways of God with men. [...] "How unsearchable are his judgments, and <b>his</b> <b>ways</b> <b>past</b> finding out!"

[...] Wherefore should the Apostle by this term, conclude, or insinuate, that what he calls here breadths, lengths, depths, or heights, might be fully, or perfectly understood and known, he would not only contradict other scriptures, but himself, in one and the self same breath. Wherefore it must be understood comparatively; that is, and that he says, with, or as much as others, as any, even with all saints. That ye {{may be able to}} comprehend with all saints, what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height. I would ye were as able to understand, to know, and to find out these things, as ever any were; and to know with the very best of saints, The love of Christ, which passeth knowledge.
