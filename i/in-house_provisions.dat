Specifically, we investigate how much cities switch between <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> and contracting out from 1982 to 2002, in what pattern or direction the switching occurs, what services {{are likely to be}} switched, and what cities are likely to switch. We find that any given city-service is roughly {{three times more likely to}} be switched at least once over the time period, as opposed to consistently remaining in-house or contracted out. Summing across cities, more than half of the services they provide had a net increase or decrease in contracting of ten percent or more: some services trended towards <b>in-house</b> <b>provision,</b> some towards contracting, and still others moved back and forth. Services that were most likely to switch had lower fixed costs, were project oriented, had low knowledge barriers, had somewhat visible quality levels, were uninvolved with internal government affairs, and tended to have quality issues that were of medium importance. On a city level, we found that high population contributes to in-house switching, high levels of debt and high median income...|$|R
40|$|In the United States, the two {{principal}} modes of producing local government services are <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> by government employees and contracting out to private suppliers, {{also known as}} privatization. We examine empirically how U. S. counties choose the mode of providing services.

This points to the important roles played by political patronage and taxpayer resistance to government spending in the privatization decision. ...|$|R
40|$|General {{empirical}} {{evidence suggests that}} contracting out refuse collection results in a cost decrease {{in the order of}} 20 %. However, although the method of contracting out refuse collection has become more popular, it is still less common than <b>in-house</b> <b>provision.</b> This paper investigates the reasons behind this phenomenon. Recently, L?pez-de-Silanes et al. (1997) tried to explain the reservedness of local authorities towards contracting out with US-data and show that political patronage is an important explanation. In this article we give such an empirical assessment using Dutch data. We base our empirical research on the combination of the theories around efficiency, interest group influence and ideology. To test these theories we model the choice between private and public provision of refuse collection on the one hand side and the choice between <b>in-house</b> and out-house <b>provision</b> on the other side. Data are available for nearly all Dutch municipalities. A most striking conclusion is that nearly all political parties in the Netherlands do have a preference for public and <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> of refuse collection. We find only modest evidence for the hypothesis that a high level of real estate tax (proxy for the soundness of municipal financial affairs, the efficiency argument) or a low level of unemployment (the interest group argument) raises the probability of private and out-house provision. We find more evidence for the assumed relation between the size of municipalities and private collection. In all cases a smaller municipality has a higher chance of private collection. Therefore, scale effects are important for the choice between public and private provision. For the choice between out-house and in-house collection in relation to scale less evidence exists. Compared with other studies we estimated more general models, allowing for higher order effects and heteroskedasticity. We show that the standard Logit model is too restrictive, both for the choice between private and public provision and the choice between <b>in-house</b> and out-house <b>provision.</b> Signs and significance do differ between the different models. Especially, for the choice between <b>in-house</b> and out-house <b>provision</b> the applied model matters. In this case, only unemployment and municipality size has influence. Thus, more attention is needed for the implications of model choice for the explanation of the raised questions...|$|R

40|$|We {{set up a}} {{model of}} public service {{provision}} to study the factors determining whether outsourcing to for-profit and not-for-profit producers of social services will enable a local government to achieve a given service quality at lower budgetary cost. Outsourcing provides an incentive for producers to lower quality {{in order to reduce}} costs. The cost reductions per se tend to be efficiency-improving, but to prevent a deterioration of service quality policy makers must spend more resources on monitoring quality. Moreover, the greater effort exerted under private service provision will have to be compensated by higher factor rewards. Hence public <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> may be more cost-efficient than outsourcing. This is particularly likely to be the case when the quality of the service is difficult to measure so that marginal monitoring costs are high.

40|$|Abstract This article {{argues that}} the {{observed}} elasticity of substitution between military and civilian labour within a defence ministry provides {{an indication of the}} likely scope for efficient outsourcing of military services. Military labour can only be employed by government, so outsourcing military services to private firms requires replacement of military labour with civilian labour. The degree to which such substitution occurs under <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> offers an insight into how much may be undertaken through outsourcing without compromising operational effectiveness. We obtain an estimate of the elasticity of substitution between military and civilian labour in the UK over the period 1970 and 2008 by estimating the Ministry of Defence's relative demand for military labour. Instruments based on the relative supply of military labour are used to account for the endogeneity of relative wages. The long run elasticity is estimated to be around 0. 75, though a value of 1 cannot be rejected. The estimated elasticity suggests that there remains scope for further outsourcing of military activities in the UK. ...|$|R

40|$|Cost {{shifting}} is {{an organizational}} strategy to improve organizational profitability and to rationalise {{the arguments for}} survival or continuity. The extant literature provides ample evidence of its routine use in organizations with two pronged operating structure, a competitive segment and a monopoly segment. Cost shifting strategy {{has been used in}} the defense, health care and regulated monopolies for centuries. The use of cost shifting strategy in government funded regulated organizations in Australia is only a recent addition to extant practice. The current qualitative case study empirically investigates the conventional wisdom that cost shifting is an effective organizational strategy to rationalise survival of business segments. To validate this conventional wisdom, the study is undertaken in a budget constrained government organization in Australia. Using archival data, semi-structured and focused group interviews, the study explores if the organization studied benefited from cost shifting strategy to rationalise operations of one of its competitive segments. The competitive segment had to undergo mandatory market testing and competitive bidding exercise to justify the efficiency of its <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> and to comply with the accountability obligations to different stakeholders such as the local and state governments. The case study evidence was analysed by patterns and themes. The study finds that the organization used cost shifting strategically within the stricter codes of conduct of different regulatory and reporting frameworks, managed to save costs, and was successful in receiving stakeholder endorsement on <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> of the service. However, the cost shifting arrangement imposed a number of operational risks on other parts (the monopoly units) of the organization. The monopoly segments feared future regulatory scrutiny for exceeding budgetary expenditure thresholds and reclassification of their services as competitive services. Such reclassification was envisaged as harmful by some important users and was contrary to the organization’s agendas on some important services (e. g., aged care, meals on wheels). The findings of the study implies that cost shifting strategy may be repeatedly used {{in the absence of any}} regulatory oversight and stakeholders sanctions on funds for service provisions. However, if cost shifting imbalances expenditure thresholds and imposes risks on any organizational unit, then longer term solutions such as cost reductions or productivity improvements need to be contemplated. So, government organizations following such cost shifting practice and likely to anticipate regulatory oversight on such manipulative practice will benefit from the insights gleaned from this paper...|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} the organisation of employment services, labour market programmes, unemployment insurance (UI) benefits and social assistance in Poland {{according to the}} legislation that was in force until January 2009, when the Act on employment promotion and labour market institutions was amended. The decentralisation of employment service began in 1998 and was completed in 2002. Since decentralisation, local-level poviat labour offices (PUP) report to local mayors (starosta or prezydent miasta na prawach powiatu). However, state structures at a regional level supervise the performance of both the PUP and, at the regional level, the voivodeship labour offices (WUP). These offices must follow some centrally-defined rules and legal standards: for example, a Ministerial guideline in 2007 defined minimum numbers of staff they should employ by main function. However, their operational costs are in principle borne by the respective territorial levels of government. Under-financing is common, and there are concerns that decentralisation has led to more uneven service provision and performance. Local budgets {{may be used to}} finance the outsourcing of some PUP labour market services, but local authorities usually find that <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> is cheaper. ...|$|R

40|$|Microinsurance is a {{powerful}} tool in helping low-income households transition out of poverty, {{but it has not}} achieved substantial scale compared with microcredit. In India, microfinance institutions (MFIs) initially showed great potential in offering microinsurance through <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> (the mutual model) or as agents for mainstream microinsurance companies (the partner– agent model). Over time, however, both models revealed significant flaws. The mutual model appeared limited because the community absorbs all the risk, and the partner–agent model experienced severe implementation issues, causing many large MFIs in India to scale back its use. The microinsurance industry is battling the challenges of an infant industry—challenges made more severe by the difficulty of providing high-quality services at a price that the target population is willing to pay. Yet slow progress and the experiences of a few MFIs offer hope that MFIs can become a suitable delivery channel for microinsurance products.

Some such transfers of control are mutually beneficial, a simple re-division of labour which acknowledges a changing social or environmental context or just the shifting balance of the preferences and priorities amongst the actors involved.

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 96 - 99. Health {{reforms that}} {{advocate}} for more private sector {{involvement in the}} provision and financing of health services are increasingly being considered {{as a means of}} ensuring more efficient provision of health related services. Though such reforms may be designed, funded and implemented it does not imply that the conditions necessary for them to yield the intended results do exist. One such reform is contracting out. The only national referral hospital Uganda {{has a long history of}} contracting out health support services, but there is hardly any empirical evidence of the resultant efficiency gains. To study the contractual arrangements in the hospital a theoretical framework based on what determines contract performance was used as the basis for the analysis. Several methodology approaches were used, which included in-depth structured interviews with the hospital administrator and key government officials on the entire contractual process and to establish the regulations and policies underlying the contracting out policy in the country. In addition a detailed documentary review was done for the contract design and implementation and other issues pertaining to the cleaning and security services. Cost data was obtained from the hospital’s expenditure and accounts records. Quality of the services data was collected using a quantitative interview schedule that required consumers to indicate their satisfaction with the security and cleaning services when they are provided in-house as opposed to when they are provided by contractors. One of the major findings is that while it was cheaper to provide cleaning services through contracting out, it was actually more costly to provide security services through contracting out than <b>in-house</b> <b>provision.</b> Therefore there is no clear pattern to support the hypothesis that health support services can be provided at a lower cost than direct provision of services. This is because contract costs are a function of service complexity, contestability and management capacity. Services that are hard to specify involve uncertainty about the nature and costs of production itself, which is likely to increase total contract costs both during contract negotiations and the post contract stage. Secondly, contractors had succeeded in providing better quality services than <b>in-house</b> <b>provision.</b> One pertinent issue of contract design is that is key to contract success is the detailed specifications of the expected outcome in terms of both quantity and quality for this greatly eases the enforcement and monitoring process and is likely to a positive impact on the quality of services that the contractors provide, for both parties will have a clear picture of what was expected. The study highlights a number of factors that contribute to the success of contracts: First, governments needs cost and quality information on its own services for this should be the basis upon which decisions to contract out should be made. Secondly, award and renewal of contracts requires regular and detailed evaluation of provider performance and of the market situation especially in low contestability and competition. Thirdly, there is need to have incentives within the management of contracts efficient monitoring. Lastly, contract failure was attributed more to the government bureaucratic and centralised systems that often resulted in delays in awarding contracts and paying contractors...|$|R

First, an in-house low-efficiency machine was used. Then, scans were done at another area hospital, in effect duplicating {{some aspects of}} regionalizing services. Finally, a high-efficiency in-house machine was used. Clinical outcomes and costs of diagnosing 181 bronchogenic cancer patients were compared across the three time periods to identify any differences associated with regionalization of CT services. Patient groups were homogeneous with respect to sociodemographic characteristics, clinical presentation, and severity of disease. The {{first part of the}} analysis investigated whether the site of CT scanning affected clinical outcomes. Diagnostic procedures, surgical results, mortality, and length of stay were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Significant differences were found only for conventional tomography and CT utilization rates. While conventional tomography declined across the periods, CT utilization increased, exceeding national trends. The second part of the analysis examined the costs of CT scanning. During the regionalized period, the hospital paid a fixed fee of $ 519 per scan. Estimated costs of in-house scans were $ 285 in the low-efficiency and $ 141 in the high-efficiency periods. Charge-based payments made to the external facility and differences in the volumes of patients scanned internally account for the cost differences. The analysis showed that while regionalized CT scanning did not compromise the quality of care for these VA patients, it was more costly. Results suggest that VA hospital administrators should carefully consider ownership and payment arrangements when comparing regionalized and <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> of services...|$|R

The increase in collaboration across the public sector between the public, private and voluntary sectors has been promoted under New Labour in public leisure provision, either through contracts or partnership arrangements. The transfer to collaboration has created significantly new modes of service delivery, including in-house, leisure trust, and private leisure management contractor arrangements. There {{is a need to}} examine and test in a more focused way the practices of those engaged in collaborative structures and reflect upon the implications these models present from a strategic management perspective. To this end, the thesis adopts a resource-based view of the firm and seeks to examine how the three approaches to public leisure provision develop strategies and effectively utilise and deploy resources through their strategic actions, with the overarching aim to achieve strategic outcomes. The main findings of the empirical analyses are two-fold. Firstly, of the three approaches examined, <b>in-house</b> <b>provision</b> has the most to gain from being more strategically aware. The case is made for significant strengthening oflocal {{government in}}-house managed facilities, which has often been viewed as the poor relation in public leisure provision and stands to lose the most in funding cuts and the subsidies provided to leisure trust rivals. Secondly, leisure trusts receive significant government funds and subsidies through tax breaks that are not forthcoming to rivals, which raises questions as to whether leisure trusts deserve such aid for delivering upon the social inclusion agenda of the government. Given that inclusion is not heavily emphasised or significantly achieved to any greater degree than rivals, {{it can be argued that}} this approach to provision does not justify the financial perks oftrust status provided to it. This thesis calls for a fundamental rethink of public policy and for the current public leisure management playing field to be levelled in a rebalance of opportunity and investment through the removal of anti-competitive measures in service delivery.

40|$|A {{growing body}} of {{empirical}} evidence fails to support rational choice expectations of superior private sector efficiency in the urban water sector. Drawing on Oliver Williamson’s work on comparative institutional analysis, I suggest that institutional adaptability explains the efficiency and effectiveness {{of the public sector}} relative to the private sector. Under private sector participation, lowly remediable institutional adaptability favours the deployment of asymmetric power and the production of outcomes unaligned to reform objectives. Conversely, institutions supporting public operations are designed to facilitate the achievement of collective goals. This makes the alignment of individual attitudes, resources and institutions under <b>in-house</b> service <b>provision</b> less resilient to sustainability-oriented change. Remediable institutional alignment undergirds the comparative advantage of public water operations, as more ample opportunities are provided for compliance, allocative efficiency and adaptive performance. I thus call for a critical realist account of the outcomes of water service reform, free of rational choice dogma...|$|R

This paper focuses on the way that WWB recipients are being reintegrated in the labour market through an analysis of different levels of ‘public-private partnerships’ between local governments and private reintegration companies. The Netherlands’ decentralized welfare system allows municipalities to choose varying degrees of <b>in-house</b> and outsourced <b>provisions</b> of reintegration services. This paper argues {{that the decision to}} undertake this kind of public private partnership is based on the assessment of three main factors, namely, quality, price and accountability...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Local government in England have reformed the management of their public services over many years. The increase in collaboration across the public sector between the public, private and voluntary sectors has been promoted under New Labour in public leisure provision, either through contracts or partnership arrangements. The transfer to collaboration has created significantly new modes of service delivery, including in-house, leisure trust, and private leisure management contractor arrangements. There {{is a need to}} examine and test in a more focused way the practices of those engaged in collaborative structures and reflect upon the implications these models present from a strategic management perspective. To this end, the thesis adopts a resource-based view of the firm and seeks to examine how the three approaches to public leisure provision develop strategies and effectively utilise and deploy resources through their strategic actions, with the overarching aim to achieve strategic outcomes.

40|$|Background The {{number of}} beds in care homes (with and without nurses) in the United Kingdom is three {{times greater than the}} {{number of beds}} in National Health Service (NHS) hospitals. Care homes are {{predominantly}} owned by a range of commercial, not-for-profit or charitable providers and their residents have high levels of disability, frailty and co-morbidity. NHS support for care home residents is very variable, and it is unclear what models of clinical support work and are cost-effective. Objectives To critically evaluate how the NHS works with care homes. Methods A review of surveys of NHS services provided to care homes that had been completed since 2008. It included published national surveys, local surveys commissioned by Primary Care organisations, studies from charities and academic centres, grey literature identified across the nine government regions, and information from care home, primary care and other research networks. Data extraction captured forms of NHS service provision for care homes in England in terms of frequency, location, focus and purpose. Results Five surveys focused primarily on general practitioner services, and 10 on specialist services to care home. Working relationships between the NHS and care homes lack structure and purpose and have generally evolved locally. There are wide variations in provision of both generalist and specialist healthcare services to care homes. Larger care home chains may take a systematic approach to both organising access to NHS generalist and specialist services, and to supplementing gaps with <b>in-house</b> <b>provision.</b> Access to dental care for care home residents appears to be particularly deficient. Conclusions Historical differences in innovation and provision of NHS services, the complexities of collaborating across different sectors (private and public, health and social care, general and mental health), and variable levels of organisation of care homes, all lead to persistent and embedded inequity in the distribution of NHS resources to this population. Clinical commissioners seeking {{to improve the quality of}} care of care home residents need to consider how best to provide fair access to health care for older people living in a care home, and to establish a specification for service delivery to this vulnerable population...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the supply of}} a public good based on a publicly owned facility. The Government has a choice between <b>provision</b> <b>in-house</b> and privatizing the facility and then outsourcing the production. In particular, we focus on corruption {{in the decision to}} privatize and on its effect on social welfare when there is asymmetric information on the public and private manager’s efficiency. Our analysis shows that a corrupt Government, that chooses to privatize only in exchange for a bribe, makes a positive selection on the private firm’s efficiency and, thus, may {{have a positive effect on}} social welfare...|$|R
