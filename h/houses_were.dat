5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, the <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For {{many of the}} smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, the doors were aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|Hearths and oblong shaped ovens {{were found}} in a semicircular hut. The white colour of the soil around the hearth and the ovens found at the site pointed to animal meat roasted in the ovens, likely for {{community}} feeding. Rice was a staple food.

Burnt chunks of clay with reed or bamboo impressions suggest that <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> destroyed by fire. <b>Houses</b> <b>were</b> larger in size in the Chalcolithic period compared to the Neolithic period, made of reeds and bamboo with mud plaster and flooring of fired earth.

5|$|At {{the same}} time as these keeps were being built by the {{extremely}} wealthy, much smaller, keep-like structures called tower houses or peel towers were built across Ireland, Scotland, and northern England, often by relatively poorer local lords and landowners. It was originally argued that Irish tower <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> based on the Scottish design, but the pattern of development of such castles in Ireland does not support this hypothesis. A tower house would typically be a tall, square, stone-built, crenelated building; Scottish and Ulster tower <b>houses</b> <b>were</b> often also surrounded by a barmkyn or bawn wall. Most academics have concluded that tower houses should not be classified as keeps but rather as a form of fortified house.|$|E
