5|$|The last heroine in Clannad is {{a first-year}} student named Fuko Ibuki {{who has a}} distant {{attitude}} towards others and, before she met Tomoya, was generally seen alone by herself making wood carvings of starfish with a small knife to give to others as presents. Fuko is extremely enthralled by starfish, or things that are star-shaped, and will often go into short euphoric bouts where her awareness of <b>her</b> <b>surroundings</b> is completely overtaken.|$|E
5|$|The second, smaller {{pavilion}} {{is known}} as the Tranofitaratra ("house of glass") and was constructed in 1862 under the orders of Ranavalona II. The queen would gather her ministers for counsel in this building, and the large windows on all four sides of the building provided a view of the countryside below, enabling the queen to ascertain the security of <b>her</b> <b>surroundings.</b> The glass used in the construction was imported by an Englishman named Parrett in 1862.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a fascination with the human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore <b>her</b> <b>surroundings,</b> and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E

5|$|Madonna in the Church (or The Virgin in the Church) {{is a small}} {{oil panel}} by the early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. Probably {{executed}} between c. 1438–40, it depicts the Virgin Mary holding the Child Jesus in a Gothic cathedral. Mary is presented as Queen of Heaven wearing a jewel-studded crown, cradling a playful child Christ who gazes at her and grips {{the hem of her}} red dress in a manner that recalls the 13th-century Byzantine tradition of the Eleusa icon (Virgin of Tenderness). Tracery in the arch {{at the rear of the}} nave contains wooden carvings depicting episodes from Mary's life, while a faux bois sculpture in a niche shows her holding the child in a similar pose. Erwin Panofsky sees the painting composed as if the main figures in the panel are intended to be the sculptures come to life. In a doorway to the right, two angels sing psalms from a hymn book. Like other Byzantine depictions of the Madonna, van Eyck depicts a monumental Mary, unrealistically large compared to <b>her</b> <b>surroundings.</b> The panel contains closely observed beams of light flooding through the cathedral's windows. It illuminates the interior before culminating in two pools on the floor. The light has symbolic significance, alluding simultaneously to Mary's virginal purity and God's ethereal presence.|$|E

25|$|Through her stories, Kate Chopin wrote {{a kind of}} {{autobiography}} {{and described}} her societies; {{she had grown up}} in a time when <b>her</b> <b>surroundings</b> included the abolitionist movements before the American Civil War, and their influence on freedmen education and rights afterward, as well as the emergence of feminism. Her ideas and descriptions were not reporting, but her stories expressed the reality of her world.|$|E
25|$|In 1956 Juvonen, who was {{supporting}} herself by selling prints from a stall in the Pike Place Market, {{moved into a}} small house in Edmonds, Washington. The shack-like house was soon overrun with cats and chickens, and neighbors complained frequently. In 1959, she was committed to Northern State Hospital in Sedro-Woolley, Washington. After one year of confinement there, she was transferred to Oakhurst Infirmary (later known as Oakhurst Convalescent Center) in Elma, Washington, where she {{spent the rest of}} her life. In spite of <b>her</b> <b>surroundings,</b> Juvonen tirelessly continued to produce art, using whatever materials she was able to secure.|$|E
25|$|Rise {{says that}} the white {{community}} disdained Ruby Floyd for her missionary work with the Jehovah's Witnesses and for her willingness to enter the black part of Martinsville. The prosecution pointed out that Floyd had had gone to an area considered unsafe for white women, ignored warnings of black residents of staying too long there, and not been attentive to <b>her</b> <b>surroundings</b> or the men she passed. A relative of the Hairstons has said that their family tradition always said that Floyd had been {{having an affair with}} one of the defendants, but this was not explored at trial.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the early}} nineties, she has {{produced}} albums of lithographs based on Phoenician legends and studied porcelain painting, while still {{working as a}} designer and illustrator. Bassili Sehnaoui has been exhibiting art since the mid-sixties. Her seemingly naïve paintings most often reference <b>her</b> own <b>surroundings,</b> <b>her</b> country and its cultural heritage. The works suggest a very personal interpretation of space where shapes and line interpenetrate in colourful harmonies.|$|R

She has about three years left to live naturally at most.|$|E
25|$|At {{an early}} age, doctors {{diagnosed}} that the singer suffered from 40-percent hearing loss {{in her left}} ear and 20-percent in her right, after discovering that the protective envelope of her eardrums had vanished. Consequently, she had ear tubes placed and, a month prior to her American Idol audition, fits for silicon spray ear plugs. Miller's condition has affected her singing, obstructing her hearing of <b>her</b> <b>surroundings,</b> rather than herself. She claimed that she learned to manage {{it a couple of}} years prior to her American Idol audition. In January 2013, her mother revealed to The Salem News that a third surgery to skin graft her eardrum was impending once Miller completed her stint on the series.|$|E

While unpacking, Dana suddenly becomes dizzy, and <b>her</b> <b>surroundings</b> begin to fade away. When she comes to her senses, she finds herself {{at the edge of a}} wood, near a river where a small, red-haired boy is drowning. Dana wades in after him, drags him to the shore, and tries to resuscitate him. The boy's mother, who had been unable to save him, begins screaming and hitting Dana, accusing her of killing her son, whom she identifies as Rufus. A man arrives and points a gun at Dana, terrifying her. She becomes dizzy again and arrives back at her new house with Kevin beside her. Kevin, shocked at her disappearance and reappearance, tries to understand if the whole episode was real or a hallucination.|$|E

Lords Dannyl and Rothen lead the search into the slums, worried that Sonea's {{increasingly}} uncontrolled magic will harm her and those around her. But Sonea both distrusts the Guild for their {{apparent lack of}} compassion for the poor dwells and fears their reprisal for her accidental injury of Lord Fergun. She flees with her friend Cery, eventually seeking {{the aid of the}} shady Thieves, who see the value of having their own magician and take her under their care. With Cery, she sneaks into the Magician's Guild in an attempt to gain knowledge of how to control her magic, and observes a black-robed magician covered in blood performing a strange rite on a servant. However, her attempt to learn more is unsuccessful, and Sonea continues to lose control of her powers, setting fire to <b>her</b> <b>surroundings</b> repeatedly, before Lord Rothen at last locates her.|$|E

500|$|Tennyson's poems {{traditionally}} {{rely on the}} use {{of visual}} imagery for effect. In [...] "Mariana", Tennyson instead emphasises auditory imagery that serves to emphasise her solitude. Her hearing is sensitive and she is able to hear every sound, which only reveals the silence of <b>her</b> <b>surroundings.</b> Her solitude and loneliness causes her to be unable to recognise the beauty of <b>her</b> <b>surroundings,</b> and the world to her is dreary. In contrast to Tennyson's other poems, including [...] "The Lady of Shalott", there is no movement within [...] "Mariana". There is also a lack of a true ending within the poem, unlike the later version Mariana in the South, which reworks the poem so there is a stronger conclusion that can be found within death.|$|E
