She added that Mercedes confiding secrets in Doctor Browning [...] "served only to bring them closer.

5000|$|Self-conscious and naïve {{imitation}} of cultural norms, such as attempting to stage an elegant dinner {{for an audience}} member with Twinkies; or following the Rock Concert Instruction Manual {{with the expectation that}} following a series of instructions <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to put on a rock concert.|$|E

In addition, it is possible that a single cell transformed into a cancer cell <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to develop the full effect (the [...] "one hit" [...] theory).|$|E

50|$|Topham Park {{represents}} the upper East {{side of this}} neighbourhood and could well be described as quaint. A quick trip through the neighbourhood (which <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes)</b> {{and you will see}} Topham Park, many residents enjoying their front parks and a very consistent feel. The rising tide in Toronto real estate fortunes over the years {{does not seem to have}} affected the style of this neighbourhood.|$|E

50|$|Three {{years after}} the end of the Apache Wars, peacemaking chief Cochise dies. His elder son Taza (Rock Hudson) shares his ideas, but brother Naiche (Bart Roberts) yearns for war...and for Taza's betrothed, Oona (Barbara Rush). Naiche loses no time in {{starting}} trouble which, thanks to a bigoted cavalry officer, ends with the proud Chiricahua Apaches on a reservation, where they are soon joined by the captured renegade Geronimo, who <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to start a war.|$|E

5000|$|Just 7 {{appearances}} in his debut season of provincial rugby <b>were</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> {{to convince the}} Christchurch-based [...] that he was worthy of a Super Rugby contract. He made their senior squad {{for the first time}} in 2016 and made 2 substitute appearances during his debut campaign. He was subsequently retained in the squad for the 2017 Super Rugby season.|$|R
50|$|One way to {{mask the}} {{symptoms}} of the spins is to avoid staring at moving objects, such as people who are dancing or ceiling fans. Instead, it helps to stare at a non-moving object and slowly blink a few times. However, it will make things worse to keep one's eyes closed for an extended period. In minor cases of the spins, simply sitting alone in a quiet place or taking a walk <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to make them subside.|$|E
5000|$|Meanwhile, Donald and Goofy have {{tracked down}} their quarry, {{a large black}} bull moose. Watching the male eat a bush full of leaves in one bite causes an jubilant Donald to add some makeup and {{lipstick}} to make the costume more attractive. Goofy adds in some [...] "deer kiss" [...] perfume to the disguise and himself and sprays a trail towards the bull, letting the wind do the rest. The moose, entranced by the scent follows it to the waiting [...] "lady moose". A mere glance <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for the rutting bull to become smitten, especially when [...] "she" [...] does a teasing walk for him.|$|E
50|$|Another, unusual variant {{was found}} in the Ortgies {{semi-automatic}} pistols. To disengage the safety, a user would squeeze a lever until flush with the rear of the grip. The lever then would latch in the disengaged position until the user released it again by pressing a button under the slide, whereupon tension from the striker spring would push it back to the engaged position. Thus, engaging the safety also relieved some tension in the striker spring. As the Ortgies is a pocket pistol meant for personal defense, this feature eliminates the problem of failing to disengage the safety when one needs to shoot. Gripping the pistol tightly <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to disengage the safety.|$|E
50|$|It was {{a moment}} before the {{significance}} struck and a gasp of sharp fear seized <b>all</b> who heard <b>it.</b> That moment <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> for the killer to strike and slaughter all the others, before escaping with his goal accomplished, along with documents Schmidt was carrying, and the bonus of the special crystal, with which he could use to unerringly identify {{all members of the}} Brotherhood.|$|R

5000|$|The {{album was}} not {{received}} with particular enthusiasm. Robert L. Doerschuk of Allmusic noted [...] "Get it Out" [...] an AMG Track Pick and stated, [...] "There's {{no doubt that}} grade 8 can pummel {{through a set of}} neo-metal material and, most likely, tear it up on-stage; the only question is why that may <b>be</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to make <b>it</b> in a style whose rules are as rigid and unforgiving as those of even the most conservative genres." ...|$|R
5000|$|Big Joe & the Dynaflows debut album, Good Rockin Daddy was {{released}} by Ichiban Records in 1990. [...] Then followed a string of releases on various record labels up to All Night Long (2000). These included, Mojo, a stripped down affair which featured Jeff Sarli on bass guitar. In December 1994, The Washington Post noted that [...] "listening to the opening (and title) track {{for a few seconds}} <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to confirm that this sessions atmosphere and pacing {{has more to do with}} Percy Mayfields laconic balladry, than Big Joe Turners barroom barking". His 1998 release, Im Still Swingin, was given a Washington Area Music Award for Best Blues Recording. Maher has also performed with his own Big Three Trio and the Big Four Combo, which have included John Cocuzzi.|$|E
5000|$|The Guardian {{gave the}} album three stars {{out of five}} and {{described}} the closing track [...] "I Don't Need a Lover" [...] as [...] "This one is a piano ballad dominated by a vocal performance of silvery regret and loss. It’s {{a reminder of how}} good Young can be (and how much he has influenced Sam Smith)." [...] Clashmusic.com also focused on the final track within their 7 out of 10 review, describing it as [...] "The album's finest moment, 'I Don't Need A Lover', concludes proceedings with a minimal backdrop to accompany Young's emotive falsetto built around a piano and some relatively reserved strings. It's quite sincerely breathtaking and a reminder that no matter who the artist or the genre, a well-written song paired with a striking voice <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to capture the listener's ear." ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the pilot}} ready room, Apollo enters {{to give a}} briefing. He overhears the pilots {{chattering}} about how many days {{it has been since}} they encountered the Cylons, which is currently at 49 days. Apollo berates their celebration saying they only need to consider the number [...] "1" [...] — since [...] "one slip-up" [...] <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to jeopardize the fleet. Adama watches his son's stern lecture from the doorway as Carolanne's image returns to his mind. She scoffs at the fact that he never tells Lee how much he loves him and that he lets performance reviews express his feelings instead of words. Afterwards, Adama tells his son of Roslin's request that he handle the legal proceedings. Apollo is flattered saying he remembers looking through his grandfather's legal textbooks and that he briefly considered becoming a lawyer instead of joining the military. Apollo refuses because the duties of the CAG already consume all his time.|$|E
5000|$|Just {{one season}} of provincial rugby with Hawke's Bay <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> to bring Abbott to the {{attention}} of New Zealand's Super Rugby franchises and he opted to sign for the Wellington-based [...] ahead of the 2014 Super Rugby season. [...] As a result of his lack of top level experience and the 'Canes having locks such as Jeremy Thrush, James Broadhurst and Blade Thomson on their books, Abbott was restricted to just 2 appearances in his first season of Super Rugby.|$|R

50|$|According to the Eastern Wake News, the {{television}} series {{got its start}} {{at the end of}} August 2008, when the station sent a cameraman down for one day of shooting and that <b>was</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>took</b> for a contract to be written. Those at the network were merely scouting out prospects at the time, but after realizing Amy Shirley was not only a power lifter, but a mortician and co-owner of the recovery business, they realized there was more color to the picture than originally anticipated.|$|R
50|$|Miley goes to {{the home}} of Dr. Eugene Murrick, who offers him a little red pill. He takes the pill and Dr. Murrick sends him home, saying that <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes,</b> for now. He returns to his {{favorite}} bar only to find out that alcohol now has no effect on him. After enough booze to knock out any normal man, he isn't even buzzing. He then goes to Murrick to find out what's going on. It turns out that the pill contained a Hellgramite, a tapeworm that absorbs all traces of alcohol in a person, thus rendering them sober no matter how much they drink; but since it feeds on alcohol it will grow larger in his stomach and kill him if he continues to drink. The only solution is to starve the tapeworm, but to do so invites painful withdrawal. If he can endure the withdrawal pains, the tapeworm will eventually be forced into a hibernation state, thus giving a measure of freedom to the host. But if he ever drinks one drop of alcohol again, the tapeworm will once again wake up.|$|E
50|$|Baratos {{began to}} slowly re-release its albums in CD form, thus {{reaching}} a new audience {{both inside and}} outside the country. The label also went back to releasing compilations, mainly the two volume Brazilian Pebbles which showcases garage bands worthy of inclusion in the Nuggets collections. The first volume of the series mainly includes bands from São Paulo City, but volume two presents bands from other states and is a feast for those needing a healthy fix of fuzz guitar. The collections proved to be a testing ground for a new underground rock scene in SP populated by bands brought up on a healthy diet of 60's pop rock and 70's punk. Some of these bands proved to be so good that they released their own CDs. Such is the case of Os Skywalkers, Mákina du Tempo, Pipodélica and Gasolines. In addition to theses bands Baratos also released an exceptionally fine album by Mopho, from Alagoas state, located in the northeast of Brazil, and a strong contender for best Beatles sound alike band of all time, but with its own updated take on the classic pop sound. All these bands leave nothing to their American and British counterparts. One listen <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> for rock aficionados worldwide to agree.|$|E

The Times of India rated the film 3.5 out of 5 and wrote [...] "What makes Kirumi stand apart from other thrillers set in the backdrop of crime is its understated quality. Even when the situation offers scope to turn things into full-blown melodrama, Anucharan keeps things at a low key...and this refreshing change of pace actually keeps things interesting". Bangalore Mirror rated the film 4.5 out of 5 and wrote [...] "For a debutant, Anucharan shows a lot of maturity as well as expertise and clearly proves to the audience that he is a new kid on the block who is worth watching". Sify wrote [...] "Kirumi does have an original story and a tight screenplay. Well shot, well edited and brilliantly enacted by most of the lead actors, debutant director Anucharan gives us a bunch of fully flesh-and-blood characters with whom you can quickly relate to", describing the film as [...] "pitch perfect".|$|E

5000|$|Tommy & Tallulah do {{everything}} with utmost enthusiasm, commitment and positivity - {{even if that}} gets them further and further into trouble. They share that [...] "I {{want it to happen}} now" [...] impatience of all preschoolers, but they are 8 years old. Tommy and Tallulah love each other, back each other up and egg each other on—a convincing [...] "Well if you're sure, then I'm sure," [...] <b>is</b> <b>all</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to confirm both their commitments to a course of action. This 'can do' spirit can often produce a calamitous outcome, but their individual approach to a sticky situation and joint resourcefulness always shines through and saves the day. Tommy is funny and always ready for adventure. His 'act now think later' approach often lands the twins in a spin. He is practical and resourceful but his confidence sometimes outweighs his own ability with comedic effect. However, when things go wrong, he can always turn to his twin sister, Tallulah, for help. Tallulah is the more creative half of this duo. She is much more of a thinker and inevitably comes up with the plan to solve the problem they face. She has a big imagination and is not afraid to use it - but she knows she can always rely on Tommy for practical advice and know-how when faced with a problem she can't solve. Tommy has been voiced by Koda Gursoy and Talullah by Isabelle Seratch in the American version. Toby Ross Ralph and Ruby Love voice Tommy and Tallulah, respectively in the UK version.|$|E

Kansas State {{never looked back}} and reeled off a total of 27 unanswered points. The flat Nebraska squad was thoroughly humiliated, as the Wildcats set new series records for most points scored on Nebraska and largest margin of victory. Even through the painful 1940's Nebraska had still managed to win eight of ten Kansas State games in that decade, and ten in a row against the Wildcats overall, before this completely demoralizing defeat. The win was just the fifth ever for Kansas State against the Cornhuskers in all 37 attempts.|$|R
