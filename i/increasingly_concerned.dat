5|$|The Movie and Television Review and Classification Board {{also became}} <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about the scandal {{due to the}} {{escalating}} on-air feuds between Willie and Joeyasking Willie to make an on-air apology about his remarks towards Joey on the September 4 episode of Wowowee.|$|E
5|$|Even as the Thirteenth Amendment {{was working}} {{its way through the}} {{ratification}} process, Republicans in Congress grew <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about the potential for there to be a large increase in the congressional representation of the Democratic-dominated Southern states. Because the full population of freed slaves would be counted rather than three-fifths, the Southern states would dramatically increase their power in the population-based House of Representatives. Republicans hoped to offset this advantage by attracting and protecting votes of the newly enfranchised black population.|$|E

40|$|Pork {{represents}} {{more than}} 70 % of meat consumption in Vietnam and pig production is growing fast. Its production delivers substantial benefits to the smallholders who supply 80 % of the market. Yet, most smallholder pig farms lack technologies and disease control measures, which threaten food safety and environment conditions. While Vietnamese consumers have a strong preference for fresh, un-chilled pork sold at outlets supplied by smallholders there are <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerns</b> about pig diseases and food safety...|$|R
5|$|<b>Increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> {{about the}} {{potential}} danger to humanity arising from scientific discoveries, Oppenheimer joined with Albert Einstein, Bertrand Russell, Joseph Rotblat and other eminent scientists and academics to establish what would eventually become the World Academy of Art and Science in 1960. Significantly, after his public humiliation, he did not sign the major open protests against nuclear weapons of the 1950s, including the Russell–Einstein Manifesto of 1955, nor, though invited, did he attend the first Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a shuttlepod {{containing}} Sub-Commander T'Pol, Lieutenant Reed, Ensign Mayweather and MACO Corporal Hawkins, departs {{to investigate}} a nearby sphere {{in order to try}} to collect more data on the Sphere Builders (who are now becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> with the human threat). The away team successfully enters an exhaust vent, and reaching the core, they are able to retrieve a memory module. The intrusion alerts an automated defense system, however, and Hawkins is disintegrated helping the others escape.|$|E
5|$|Sarumpaet, {{born into}} a {{politically}} active Christian family in North Sumatra, initially studied architecture in Jakarta. After seeing a play by Willibrordus S. Rendra in 1969, she dropped out and joined his troupe. Five years later, after marrying and converting to Islam, she founded the Satu Merah Panggung; the troupe did mostly adaptations of foreign dramas. As she became <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about her marriage and unhappy about the local theatre scene, two years later Sarumpaet left her troupe and began to work in television; she only returned in 1989, after divorcing her abusive husband.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} {{performed}} for Concawe {{to obtain information}} {{on the development of}} an approach for assessing biodegradation of petrochemical effluents and the impact on assessing the toxicity and potential to bioaccumulate of the constituents. Whole Effluent Assessments (WEA) are being investigated as a potential tool for controlling aqueous discharges and minimizing environmental impact. The key parameter in such assessments relates to the toxicity of the effluent to aquatic organisms. <b>Increasingly</b> <b>concern</b> over long-term toxicity and the potential for toxicity to persist after discharge requires investigation...|$|R
30|$|Another {{concern was}} the {{overlapping}} of cohorts or subgroups of cohorts in longitudinal long-term follow-up studies (Hangody et al. 2010; Hangody & Füles 2003; Hangody et al. 2001 a; Hangody et al. 2008; Hangody et al. 2001 b; Szerb et al. 2005), an <b>increasingly</b> <b>concern</b> in the orthopaedics and surgery scientific literature (Jakobsen et al. 2005; Gwilym et al. 2004; Schein & Paladugu 2001). Concerning this issue, studies with biggest cohort and longest follow-up were selected (Hangody et al. 2010; Hangody et al. 2008; Hangody et al. 2001 b).|$|R
5|$|Starting in August 1941, when {{it became}} clear to some in the Propaganda Ministry and the Wehrmacht high command that the war would likely extend into 1942, Goebbels grew <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about the triumphant tone of the communiques. However, a string of {{spectacular}} victories in September, especially in the Battle of Kiev, removed any restraint from the texts, making propagandists's work more difficult later on, when they had to explain the Wehrmacht's failures to the German public which was rapidly losing confidence in a swift victory.|$|E
5|$|Collier {{applied to}} the Admiralty for the {{opportunity}} to clear his name, but this was not satisfied. Friends and relations had become <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about his mental state as a result. His brother took the precaution of removing the razors from his home, but Collier appears to have smuggled one to his room, and used it to cut his own throat early in the morning on 24 March 1824. His servant who was sleeping in the same room immediately brought help, but nothing could be done and Collier died less than five minutes after inflicting the injury. The inquest later determined that 'The deceased destroyed himself, being in a state of temporary mental derangement.' The baronetcy became extinct upon his death.|$|E
5|$|From 1944, the Allies became <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> with {{laying the}} {{framework}} of post-war Europe. These were formalized through numerous treaties and agreements from 1944. In July 1944, Camille Gutt attended the Bretton Woods Conference in the United States {{on behalf of the}} Belgian government, establishing the Bretton Woods System of currency controls. During the negotiations, Gutt served as an important intermediary between the delegates of the major Allied powers. Through the agreements, the Belgian Franc's exchange rate would be tied to the American Dollar after the war, while the conference also established the International Monetary Fund (IMF) of which Gutt would serve as the first director.|$|E
50|$|<b>Increasingly,</b> <b>concern</b> {{has been}} voiced over {{the rise in}} {{community}} treatment orders, medical homes, invasive supervision in homes, in addition to decades of outcry over involuntary procedures in psychiatry in the US and restrictions on human rights. In this field, no viable recourse exists for reversing actions by personnel, including professional and medical malpractice, and the most successful programs are viewed as those that result in high compliance. High medication usage is required, often against the law, and the situation worsens during any police-enforced confinement. Group homes in the non-profit sector are often operated by other than the providers involved in state or private, for-profit involuntary care.|$|R
40|$|Exposure to {{atmospheric}} ultrafine particles (UFPs, D< 100 nm) {{has been}} an <b>increasingly</b> <b>concern</b> because of their potential impact one health. Motor vehicle emissions are considered {{as one of the}} major source of UFPin urban airshed, as the combustion of both petrol and diesel engine leads to emission of particles which are predominantly in this size range (Ban-Weiss et al, 2010; Morawska et al, 2008). New particle formations (NPFs) and major facilities such as airport or seaport has also been identified as major sources of UFPs in urban airshed (Cheung et al, 2010; González et al, 2011; Mazaheri et al, 2013). However, contribution of those urban sources to ambient UFP concentrations has not been comprehensively characterized...|$|R

5|$|Husbandry, {{especially}} if it is intensive, has a substantial environmental impact, occupying {{about a third of}} the earth's ice-free land, causing loss of habitat and emitting about half of all greenhouse gas worldwide. Since the 18th century, people have become <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about the welfare of farm animals, and laws and standards are widely enforced in response. In culture, animal husbandry often has an idyllic image, featuring in children's books and songs, where happy animals live in attractive countryside. A similar image may be projected by petting farms and by historic farms that offer farmstays to paying visitors.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} Middle Ages, Scottish people, {{like most of}} Catholic Europe, were <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> with prayers for the dead, {{necessary}} to speed passage from Purgatory to Heaven. The upper nobility began to turn from patronage for monasteries to the establishing collegiate churches to pray for them, such as Lord Dummond's foundation at Innerpeffray in 1508 and Lord Fleming's re-establishment at Biggar in 1546. Those lower down in society paid for shrines, priests and masses, leading to a proliferation of altars, clergy and services within existing churches. In the burghs the primary function of craft guilds was {{to pay for the}} funerals and masses of their members. By the early sixteenth century St. Mary's in Dundee had perhaps 48 altars and St Giles' in Edinburgh over 50.|$|E
5|$|She {{pointed out}} that when the {{discussion}} was reported to Washington, the leading US generals in the U.S. military lobbied Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, claiming {{that it was no}} longer feasible to work within the parameters laid out by Saigon and that the U.S. should simply take control of anti-communist military policy, thereby necessitating a coup. The Americans became <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> with Saigon's reluctance to intensify the war effort, and bombing rebuff was regarded as a critical point. The government's plans to win over the NLF were never implemented to any degree before the government was deposed.|$|E
40|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, forests provide high quality water for domestic, agricultural, industrial, and {{ecological}} needs, with water supplies in those regions inextricably linked to forest health. Wildfires have the potential to have devastating effects on aquatic ecosystems and community drinking water supply through impacts on water quantity and quality. In recent decades, a combination of fuel load accumulation, climate change, extensive droughts, and increased human presence in forests have resulted in increases in area burned and wildfire severitya trend predicted to continue. Thus, the implications of wildfire for many downstream water uses are <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerning,</b> particularly the provision of safe drinking water, which may require additional treatment infrastructure and increased operations and maintenance costs in communities downstream of impacted landscapes.

40|$|Sustainability is {{an issue}} that <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerns</b> all those {{involved}} in the apparel industry, including textile manufacturers, apparel designers, retailers and consumers. This important book covers recent advances and novel technologies in the key areas of production, processing and recycling of apparel. Part One addresses sustainable finishing and dyeing processes for textiles. The first two chapters concentrate on the environmental impact of fabric finishing, including water consumption, emissions and waste management. Further chapters focus on plasma and enzymatic treatments for sustainable textile processing, and the potential for improving the sustainability of dyeing technologies. Part Two covers issues of design, retail and recycling, and includes discussions of public attitudes towards sustainability in fashion, methods of measuring apparel sustainability and social trends in the re-use of apparel...|$|R
40|$|Within other disciplines, the {{merging of}} {{physical}} form with digital contents and behaviors occurred alike. Product Design <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerns</b> complex computational behavior and designers need to rethink how to make IT-related appliances legible and usable. Design researchers have come to investigate how form and digital behavior can be more closely coupled and how users could interact in richer ways with digital products. Therefore this paper would trace a theoretical dissertation about the evolution of HCI technologies and interaction design approaches focusing on the necessity {{to return to a}} more direct connection with “materiality” and perceptual values. Several theoretical dissertations, from the last fifteen years, are here taken in account to sustain this thesis. The cases here analyzed are few representative examples of this approach, including both tangible oriented interaction projects and relational/participatory urban installation experiences...|$|R
5|$|Since the 18th century, {{people have}} become <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about the welfare of farm animals. Possible {{measures}} of welfare include longevity, behavior, physiology, reproduction, freedom from disease, and freedom from immunosuppression. Standards and laws for animal welfare have been created worldwide, broadly {{in line with the}} most widely held position in the western world, a form of utilitarianism: that it is morally acceptable for humans to use non-human animals, provided that no unnecessary suffering is caused, and that the benefits to humans outweigh the costs to the livestock. An opposing view is that animals have rights, should not be regarded as property, and should never be used by humans.|$|E
5|$|The {{men in the}} Castle Inn {{retreated to}} Penydarren House, who were joined by the initial {{reinforcements}} from the Yeomanry, bringing the establishment's numbers to around 300, {{not all of them}} were armed and able to fight. They faced increasingly well-armed insurgents and Bute became <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> {{about the quality of the}} opposition facing his men. Bute sent spies into the insurgency, and nearby Cyfarthfa Castle was pressed into service as an observation post. Bute mobilised military pensioners, and used them to start to bring Penydarren House additional weaponry from Cardiff; he was advised to be careful, however, in case the shipments fell into the hands of the insurgency. Morgan's forces were able to prevent the radical crowds from entering either Penydarren or Cyfartha, and Bute arrested potential insurgents in Cardiff.|$|E
5|$|Vizzini {{initially}} {{supported the}} separatist movement in Sicily. On December 6, 1943, Vizzini participated {{at the first}} clandestine regional convention of the Sicilian separatists movement of the Sicilian Independence Movement (Movimento Indipendentista Siciliano - MIS) in Catania. Other prominent Mafia bosses like Giuseppe Genco Russo, Gaetano Filippone, Michele Navarra and Francesco Paolo Bontade did not hide their sympathies for the separatists either. The separatists benefited from covert support of the OSS. As Italy experienced a leftward drift in 1943-1944, the American military became <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about their future prospects in Italy. The island's naval bases and strategic location in the Mediterranean provided a possible future counterbalance to a Communism on the Italian mainland. The Italian Communist Party's membership had doubled and the largely left inspired resistance movement in the north was gathering strength.|$|E

5|$|When Tennyson {{heard on}} 1 October 1833 of his friend's death, {{he was living}} in Somersby, Lincolnshire, in cramped {{quarters}} with his mother and nine of his ten siblings. His father had died in 1831, requiring Tennyson to return home and take responsibility for the family. Tennyson's friends were becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> about his mental and physical health during this time. The family had little income, and three of Tennyson's brothers were mentally ill. Just as Tennyson's outlook was improving—he was adjusting to his new domestic duties, regaining contact with friends, and had published his 1832 book of poems—the news of Hallam's death arrived. Tennyson shared his grief with his sister, Emily, who had been engaged to Hallam.|$|E
5|$|Building for the 1975–76 {{campaign}} {{he signed}} Phil Boersma from Liverpool to replace Murdoch, but Boersma never settled {{at the club}} and was frequently injured. They finished in 13th place, {{and went on to}} win the Anglo-Scottish Cup with a 1–0 win over Fulham. They also reached the semi-finals of the League Cup, and took a 1–0 lead over Manchester City into the second leg at Maine Road, where they were soundly beaten 4–0. However teams had begun to learn how to combat Charlton's attack strategy and left their centre-backs on the outside of the penalty box to neutralise the threat of Foggon. Despite the team's steady progress the club's board voted to sack Charlton in July 1976 after becoming <b>increasingly</b> <b>concerned</b> that he was overstepping his authority in negotiating business deals on behalf of the club and choosing the club's strip. However, the club chairman overruled the decision and Charlton remained in charge.|$|E

Faye is later attacked by a heroin-addicted patient, and when Linden attempts to defend her, he is {{hit in the head}} with a glass bottle and dies. Faye suffers a breakdown in the aftermath of Linden's death, and is admitted to a psychiatric unit. She self-harms, and refuses to leave the unit when she goes into labour, until Jac assures her that Joseph does not intend to take their child away from her. Faye delivers a boy by Caesarean. She initially fails to bond with him, but when Joseph puts their divorce proceedings on hold, she makes an effort and names him Harry, after Joseph's deceased younger brother.
