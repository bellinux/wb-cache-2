5|$|Apart {{from not}} smoking, the American Cancer Society {{recommends}} keeping a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight,</b> and increasing consumption of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, while decreasing consumption {{of red and}} processed meat, {{although there is no}} consistent evidence this will prevent or reduce pancreatic cancer specifically. A 2014 review of research concluded that there was evidence that consumption of citrus fruits and curcumin reduced risk of pancreatic cancer, while there was possibly a beneficial effect from whole grains, folate, selenium, and non-fried fish.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{developing}} pancreatic cancer is lower among non-smokers, and people who maintain a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> and limit their consumption of red or processed meat. A smoker's chance {{of developing}} the disease decreases if they stop smoking, and almost returns {{to that of the}} rest of the population after 20years. Pancreatic cancer can be treated with surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, palliative care, or a combination of these. Treatment options are partly based on the cancer stage. Surgery is the only treatment that can cure pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and may also be done to improve quality of life without the potential for cure. Pain management and medications to improve digestion are sometimes needed. Early palliative care is recommended even for those receiving treatment that aims for a cure.|$|E

40|$|Background: The food {{industry}} uses market segmentation to target products toward specific groups of consumers with similar attitudinal, demographic, or lifestyle characteristics. Our aims were to identify distinguishable segments within the US overweight population to be targeted with messages and media aimed at moving Americans toward more <b>healthy</b> <b>weights.</b> Methods: Cluster {{analysis was used}} to identify segments of consumers based on both food and lifestyle behaviors related to unhealthy weights. Drawing from Social Learning Theory, the Health Belief Model, and existing market segmentation literature, the study identified five distinct, recognizable market segments based on knowledge and behavioral and environmental factors. Implications for social marketing campaigns designed to move Americans toward more <b>healthy</b> <b>weights</b> were explored...|$|R

40|$|This study, {{based on}} the Canadian Community Health Survey (2004), {{examined}} the relationship between food insecurity and overweight/obesity among Canadian adults by sex and family type using logistic regression analysis; we also provided an environmental scan of policies, programs and initiatives to address food insecurity.

Our environmental scan revealed broad recognition of the importance of addressing food insecurity and concrete recommendations to do so. We found far less recognition of the implications of food insecurity for <b>healthy</b> <b>weights</b> within a policy context. The food insecurity/overweight/obesity relationship and its policy implications are complex; we need a better understanding of how underlying social and economic conditions, sex, and family type relate to income, food security and <b>healthy</b> <b>weights...</b>|$|R

25|$|Prevention is by {{maintaining}} a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> and exercising before pregnancy.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} things to take into consideration when either trying to lose or put on weight is output versus input. It is important to know the amount of energy your body is using every day, so that your intake fits the needs of one's personal weight goal. Someone wanting to lose weight would want a smaller energy intake than what they put out. There is increasing research-based evidence that low-fat vegetarian diets consistently lead to <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> loss and management, a decrease in diabetic symptoms as well as improved cardiac health.|$|E
25|$|Prevention is by {{maintaining}} a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> and eating a diet high in fiber {{and low in}} simple carbohydrates. If there are no symptoms, treatment is usually not needed. In those who are having gallbladder attacks, surgery to remove the gallbladder is typically recommended. This can be either done through several small incisions or through a single larger incision.

25|$|Consumed {{worldwide}} by {{billions of}} people, wheat {{is a significant}} food for human nutrition, particularly in the least developed countries where wheat products are primary foods. When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a healthy food source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber recommended for children and adults, in several daily servings containing a variety of foods that meet whole grain-rich criteria. Dietary fiber may also help people feel full and therefore help with a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight.</b> Further, wheat is a major source for natural and biofortified nutrient supplementation, including dietary fiber, protein and dietary minerals.|$|E

25|$|Difficulty in chewing and {{swallowing}} makes eating {{very difficult}} and {{increases the risk of}} choking or of aspirating food into the lungs. In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube. As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory-onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of {{anorexia}} involves restoring a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight,</b> {{treating the}} underlying psychological problems, and addressing behaviors that promote the problem. While medications do not help with weight gain, {{they may be}} used to help with associated anxiety or depression. A number of types of therapy may be useful including an approach where parents assume responsibility for feeding their child, known as Maudsley family therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Sometimes people require admission to hospital to restore weight. Evidence for benefit from nasogastric tube feeding, however, is unclear. Some people will just have a single episode and recover while others may have many episodes over years. Many complications improve or resolve with regaining of weight.|$|E
25|$|Cattle drives had {{to strike}} a balance between speed and the weight of the cattle. While cattle could be driven as far as 25 miles in a single day, they would lose so much weight that they would be hard to sell when they reached the end of the trail. Usually they were taken shorter {{distances}} each day, allowed periods to rest and graze both at midday and at night. On average, a herd could maintain a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> moving about 15 miles per day. Such a pace meant that it would take as long as two months to travel from a home ranch to a railhead. The Chisholm trail, for example, was 1,000 miles long.|$|E
40|$|In the {{haemophilia}} population, obesity has {{an adverse}} effect on health care cost, chronic complications and joint disease. Although staff of federally funded Hemophilia Treatment Centers in the United States (HTCs) anecdotally recognize these outcomes, practices to promote <b>healthy</b> <b>weights</b> have not been reported. This evaluation identifies routine practices among HTCs in body mass index (BMI) assessment, perceptions about need to address obesity and roles in offering evidence-based strategies to promote <b>healthy</b> <b>weights.</b> A telephone survey was developed to assess HTCs practices including patient BMI assessment and counselling, perceptions {{about the importance of}} <b>healthy</b> patient <b>weights,</b> and HTCs roles in weight management. Ninety of the 130 federally funded HTCs contacted elected to participate and completed the telephone survey. Of these, 67 % routinely calculated BMI and 48 % provided results to patients. Approximately one-third classified obesity correctly for children (30 %) and adults (32 %), using the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions BMI cut-offs. Most HTCs (87 %) reported obesity as an issue of 'big' or 'moderate' concern and 98 % indicated HTC responsibility to address this issue. Most centres (64 %) address patient weight during comprehensive visits. One-third (33 %) of centres include a nutritionist; of those without, 61 % offer nutrition referrals when needed. Most (89 %) HTCs do not have a protocol in place to address healthy weights; 53 % indicated that guidelines are needed. HTCs offer services to help improve weight outcomes. Training programmes for calculating and interpreting BMI as well as identifying appropriate guidelines to apply to the HTC patient population are needed.

40|$|Obesity is {{a serious}} and {{increasing}} public health problem in the UK. The author discusses current evidence which suggests that intervention with individual clients is worthwhile, and that the priorities for promoting a <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> are to reduce dietary fat and eat a diet high in carbohydrates, in conjunction with moderate daily physical activity. The client is unlikely to achieve an maintain a <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> unless they find a diet and forms of exercise that they enjoy. Health professionals can help by providing evidence-based advice tailored to the individual client's preferences. For example, clients can eat more of the fruits and vegetables they like, and sugar need not be excluded from the carbohydrate components of the diet and may be beneficial in making the diet more palatable. Slow, steady weight loss should be the aim leading to maintaining a <b>healthy</b> body <b>weight</b> in the long-term. Small acceptable changes to the diet, which can be maintained lifelong, should be encouraged. Some practical suggestions for low energy diets and ways of increasing exercise are included...|$|R

25|$|Psychological {{factors in}} health had been studied {{since the early}} 20th century by {{disciplines}} such as psychosomatic medicine and later behavioral medicine, but these were primarily branches of medicine, not psychology. Health psychology began to emerge as a distinct discipline of psychology in the United States in the 1970s. In the mid-20th century there was a growing understanding in medicine {{of the effect of}} behavior on health. For example, the Alameda County Study, which began in the 1960s, showed that people who ate regular meals (e.g., breakfast), maintained a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight,</b> received adequate sleep, did not smoke, drank little alcohol, and exercised regularly were in better health and lived longer. In addition, psychologists and other scientists were discovering relationships between psychological processes and physiological ones. These discoveries include {{a better understanding of the}} impact of psychosocial stress on the cardiovascular and immune systems, and the early finding that the functioning of the immune system could be altered by learning.|$|E
25|$|There is {{debate as}} to whether the higher rate of breast cancer {{associated}} with obesity is due to a biological difference in the cancer itself, or differences in other factors such as health screen practices. It has been suggested that obesity may be a determinant for breast cancer screening by mammography. Seventeen scientific studies in the United States have found that as obesity increases in women over 40 years of age the rate of mammography reported decreases significantly. When stratified by race (white vs. black) there was a stronger relationship between obesity and lack of mammography screening among white women. Another study also found lower rates of mammography among those who were overweight and obese compared to those women who were of normal body mass index—this effect was only seen in white women. Obese {{women are more likely to}} list pain associated with mammograms as a reason for not getting screened; however, leaner women also list this as a reason for avoiding mammograms. Other reasons obese women may avoid mammography are due to lack of insurance, low income, or embarrassment at the procedure, although when these factors are accounted for, the effect of lower rates of screening are still significant. In contrast, other studies have shown that mammography patterns did not differ among women who were obese compared to those at a <b>healthy</b> <b>weight</b> indicating that there may be biological differences in cancer presentation between these groups.|$|E
