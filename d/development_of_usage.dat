40|$|Part 4 : Capture and Reuse of Product and Process InformationInternational audienceComplex {{products}} development {{relies on}} established and tested processes that embed software applications in collaborative PLM systems. Many efforts are performed by companies {{to improve their}} development process by means of research projects. However the transfer of research results into industrial processes implies {{a high level of}} risk. The maturity assessment and the proof of usage are two criteria that help decreasing the risky transition. Technology Readiness Level (TRL) methodology and usage scenarios are tools which provide evidence associated to those two criteria. In this paper, a methodology is proposed to guide stakeholders in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> scenario in the frame of TRL methodology. Thanks to the proposed methodology, {{at the end of the}} research project, the proof of usage and the maturity of engineering technology products are validated and could support their industrialization...|$|E
40|$|International audienceResearch {{projects}} in industry provide new concepts and {{new technologies to}} business, especially to product development processes. Those brand new technologies are characterized by their maturity and by their specifications. In order to optimize the industrial investment in research projects, industry tends to anticipate and to integrate the future business requirements in the research process. The integration of any research results into the product development, as a risky decision, relies on a multi-disciplinary team involvement. The decision implies discussions, contradictions and arguments. The actors are invited to decide on a go/no-go way thanks to crucial resources built continuously during the research process. The proof of usage and the assessment of technology maturity are resources that decrease the risky transition. Usage scenarios, integrated into the technology readiness level methodology, contribute to anticipate {{the use of technology}} product into industrial context. A methodology is proposed to guide stakeholders in the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> scenario. The aim of the thesis is to build a methodology in order to help R&D industrial actors to integrate with success their research technologies into product development. As a conclusion, the proof of usage and a high maturity are not sufficient for ensuring a technological transition success: in a second step, the proof of value and associated resources would have {{to be added to the}} methodology...|$|E

40|$|Land - use rights (Summary) The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to complexly discuss history, development, {{contemporary}} state {{and the future of}} the land-use rights, especially with respect to specific attribute of land as being an object of civil legal relationships. This paper can be divided into three parts - history and the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> rights, description and analysis of valid legal regulation of usage rights and finally comparison of this regulation with the draft of new Czech civil code and Slovak regulation of lease relationships. For the sake of better arrangement, the comparative part does not constitute a separate chapter, but is included in particular chapters related to relevant usage institutes instead. The first part of this thesis concerns the history of land reforms in Czech lands, demonstrating a close connection of land legal relationships with social and political changes in our territory. After the year 1948, the institutes of usage rights became one of the dominant instruments of building the socialist society, where the principle "land belongs to those who farm on in" applied. The next part of this paper is focused on valid legal regulation of usage rights, with its major usage institute being the lease according to civil code, which is a lex specialis to other legal acts that also [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Transdermal drug {{delivery}} {{systems have been}} developed {{over the past several}} decades and now include patches for birth control, nicotine addiction, and pain relief. The local application of heat can increase the diffusion coefficient of the drug in the skin and result in faster delivery of the drug and shorter time to reach a steady state concentration of the drug. While this procedure is desirable for some systems where a faster dose will aid in alleviating pain and/or symptoms, it can also be a cause of concern for some drugs. Fentanyl, a chronic pain relief drug, can cause accidental death by overdose. We report herein an analysis of the effects of various heating situations on transdermal fentanyl delivery based upon a model developed using COMSOL Multiphysics. The utilization of such a model allows for the determination of situations which may be potentially dangerous for fentanyl drug users, and enables the <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> guidelines and safety mechanisms for transdermal delivery systems. Using the computer model, the following cases were simulated: no applied heat, ThermaCare heat pad, fever, and heating blanket. The heating blanket and ThermaCare heat pad simulations showed the most dangerous increases in fentanyl blood concentration above no-heat levels: about 180 % and 100 %, respectively, over 30 hours; by contrast, the patient fever model reported a 40 % increase in fentanyl blood concentration. These simulations demonstrate the dangers of fentanyl transdermal pain patches when skin temperature is increased, and can be used to develop better patient guidelines for patch use and to improve fentanyl transdermal systems. Lastly, this computer model may be used to model other transdermal {{drug delivery}} systems for the improvement of patient guidelines and/or the development of new systems, thus decreasing the need for experimentation on subjects...|$|E

The <b>development</b> <b>of</b> <b>usage</b> and installation of PV system needs a relevant solar policy making plan through proper assessment of solar PV Energy potential. The study uses the estimate of the PV potential of an area under consideration using the PVGIS online software. The study divides the total geographic area of into a grid of „mxn‟. The PVGIS evaluated the value of incident solar radiation and generated PV energy at central coordinate of each grid. The evaluation of energy potential for four cases (based on mounting and tracking) uses two critical parameters: annual incident Global radiation and annual PV Energy production. A methodology is presented to plot the rasterized maps of the solar energy potential. The study further discusses {{a case study of}} Odisha to show the usefulness of the proposed methodology to develop a district wise strategy for promoting the installation of grid-connected PV system. The decision to install a PV plant depends on three major factors: the climatic and environment conditions of the location, the viability of commercial operations, and the government policies. Considering uncertain nature of geographical parameters development of a reliable model to predict the energy output of a plant-to-be installed becomes essential. The study proposes models that consider only two meteorological variables collected from 1195 locations of Odisha: total annual incident global radiation on the PV module and annual average air temperature. The thesis focuses on simplification at every stage of the development while validating the preciseness of the model. A case study of NIT Rourkela is considered to apply a various methods for the evaluation of PV potential. Again the current solar policy framework of India is reviewed along with the challenges the nation has to face for achieving the targets...|$|E

The possibil-ity of various uses of an interrogative sentence; uses as a question, an exclamation, a rhetorical question, a demand and a recommendation is explained based on the same denotation for the sentence. The denotation which is neutral for all possible uses is defined in terms of a new modal operator in the formal language level, and of possible world semantics in the denotational level. Our interpretation of the " Japanese end marker particle "ka " also explains some other <b>usages</b> <b>of</b> the same particle "ka " in a uniform way; especially, "ka " as the parallel listing (disjunctive) parti-cle, which is another important <b>usage</b> <b>of</b> "ka", is explained uniformly with the interrogative "ka".

We study a progressive retrieval based on "relevance feedback ", processed through a man- machine dialogue where images play an important role. In the knowledge based system we propose, EXPRIM, among a first set of images displayed to him (following a textual request or browsing in the image base), the user chooses fitting images. The system then attemps to formulate a better request, by {{trying to understand the}} user's need through his choices: the chosen images are positive illustrations of it while the rejected ones are negative illustrations. This may be viewed as a machine learning process by examples and negative examples, the concept to learn being the user's need. In the machine learning based prototype we have written in SMALLTALK on a SUN coupled with a videodisk-reader, we have tried to compare, adapt and mix some existing learning techniques. The prototype in hand is being experimented on a pilot application and progressively enhanced by adding and changing various heuristics of the knowledge base. We assume that beyond pure image retrieval, this kind of progressive requesting system may be very well suited to other applications: especially image based Computer Aided Education and Diagnosis by image. 1...|$|R
