25|$|The catastrophic {{damage to}} the rupiah caused in 1997–1998 {{severely}} damaged confidence in the currency. Even though the rupiah is <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> currency, it is still regarded as a risky currency to hold. As of 13 June 2017, one US Dollar is worth 13,300 IDR {{and it is one}} of the least valued currency units in the world.|$|E
25|$|Two separate, but <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> {{currencies}} for two wings {{should be}} introduced; or {{if this is}} not feasible, there should be one currency for the whole country, but effective constitutional provisions should be introduced to stop the flight of capital from East to West Pakistan. Furthermore, a separate banking reserve should be established and separate fiscal and monetary policy be adopted for East Pakistan.|$|E

Member nations cannot adopt any exchange measures restricting free transfer of the funds invested or from activities exercised in their respective territories.|$|E
25|$|Switzerland's most {{important}} exports {{during the war}} were precision machine tools, watches, jewel bearings (used in bombsights), electricity, and dairy products. During World War Two, the Swiss franc was the only remaining major <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> currency in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the Swiss National Bank. Between 1940 and 1945, the German Reichsbank sold 1.3 billion francs worth of gold to Swiss Banks in exchange for Swiss francs and other foreign currency.|$|E
25|$|In June 1992, Estonia {{replaced}} the ruble {{with its own}} <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> currency, the kroon (EEK). A currency board was created and the new currency was pegged to the German Mark {{at the rate of}} 8 Estonian kroons for 1 Deutsche Mark. When Germany introduced the euro the peg was changed to 15.6466 kroons for 1 euro. Estonia was set to adopt the euro in 2008 but due to high inflation rates the adoption date was delayed to 2011. On 1 January 2011, Estonia adopted the euro and became the 17th eurozone member state.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some games}} such as Second Life, in-game {{currency}} is not <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> with real world currency. Players may only buy specific in-game items (such as the Pilot License Extension (PLEX), a token worth 30 days of game time) from CCP with real-world currency. The player can then sell {{the items on}} the in-game market for ISK (game currency). The reverse process, selling in-game currency or items for real-world money, is prohibited. The developers' reasoning for this policy, as related by a CCP representative at Fanfest 2010, is that free interchange of currency causes in-game banking to fall under the same regulatory domain as real-world banking. CCP would rather not place this restriction on in-game behavior, due both to the difficulty of regulatory enforcement and the desire to allow players to create illegitimate in-game banks or Ponzi schemes if they wish to do so.|$|E
2500|$|Switzerland's {{trade was}} {{blockaded}} {{by both the}} Allies and by the Axis. Each side openly exerted pressure on Switzerland not to trade with the other. Economic cooperation and extension of credit to the Third Reich varied according to the perceived likelihood of invasion, {{and the availability of}} other trading partners. Concessions reached their zenith after a crucial rail link through Vichy France was severed in 1942, leaving Switzerland completely surrounded by the Axis. Switzerland relied on trade for half of its food and essentially all of its fuel, but controlled vital trans-alpine rail tunnels between Germany and Italy. Switzerland's most important exports during the war were precision machine tools, watches, jewel bearings (used in bomb sights), electricity, and dairy products. Until 1936, the Swiss franc was the only remaining major <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> currency in the world, and both the Allies and the Germans sold large amounts of gold to the Swiss National Bank. Between 1940 and 1945, the German Reichsbank sold 1.3billion francs worth of gold to Swiss Banks in exchange for Swiss francs and other foreign currency, which were used to buy strategically important raw materials like tungsten and oil from neutral countries. Hundreds of millions of francs worth of this gold was monetary gold plundered from the central banks of occupied countries. A total of 581,000 francs' worth of [...] "Melmer" [...] gold taken from Holocaust victims in eastern Europe was sold to Swiss banks. In total, trade between Germany and Switzerland contributed about 0.5% to the German war effort and did not significantly lengthen the war.|$|E

5000|$|The {{manner in}} which the Soviet Union transacted trade varied from one trade partner to another. Soviet trade with the Western industrialized {{countries}}, except Finland, and most Third World countries was conducted with hard currency, that is, currency that was <b>freely</b> <b>convertible.</b> Because the ruble was not <b>freely</b> <b>convertible,</b> the Soviet Union could only acquire hard currency by selling Soviet goods or gold on the world market for hard currency. Therefore, the volume of imports from countries using convertible currency depended on the amount of goods the Soviet Union exported for hard currency. Alternative methods of cooperation, such as barter, counter trade, industrial cooperation, or bilateral clearing agreements were much preferred. These methods were used in transactions with Finland, members of Comecon, the People's Republic of China, Yugoslavia, and a number of Third World countries.|$|E

Soviet oil exports to these countries bought machinery and equipment and industrial consumer goods, {{as well as political}} support without the expenditure of <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> foreign currency. In addition, Soviet aid programs, which took the form of direct loans or trade subsidies, almost exclusively involved socialist countries.|$|E
5000|$|The {{exchange}} rate between the U.S. dollar and the Vietnamese đồng {{is important because}} the dong, although not <b>freely</b> <b>convertible,</b> is loosely pegged to the dollar through an arrangement known as a [...] "crawling peg". This mechanism allows the dollar-dong {{exchange rate}} to adjust gradually to changing market conditions. As of January 1, 2017, a US dollar is worth 22,769 Vietnamese đồng.|$|E

50|$|After Hong Kong {{reinstated}} {{its currency}} board in 1983, Hanke began {{to collaborate with}} his fellow Johns Hopkins Professor, and Margaret Thatcher’s personal economic adviser, Sir Alan Walters, {{on the subject of}} currency boards. A currency board is a monetary authority that issues a local currency that is fully backed by a foreign reserve currency, and which is <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> with the foreign reserve currency at a fixed exchange rate. Walters was a key advocate of the reestablishment of Hong Kong’s currency board.|$|E
50|$|The gold {{standard}} is a monetary {{system in which}} a region's common media of exchange are paper notes that are normally <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> into pre-set, fixed quantities of gold. The standard specifies how the gold backing would be implemented, including the amount of specie per currency unit. The currency itself has no innate value, but is accepted by traders {{because it can be}} redeemed for the equivalent specie. A U.S. silver certificate, for example, could be redeemed for an actual piece of silver.|$|E

5000|$|In 1977, East Germany {{experienced}} trouble {{covering the}} domestic demand for coffee, a commodity {{that had to}} be purchased using [...] "Westgeld", or <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> western currencies, something in short supply in Eastern Bloc countries. The coffee crisis indirectly led to changes in the world market for coffee. The coffee crisis led to a reorientation of East German foreign policy as well as considerable economization. In particular, the East German government engaged in barter with Third World countries, exporting weapons and trucks in exchange for coffee and energy.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of wealth finance, the commoners do not supply staples, but rather {{valuables}} (wealth objects or prestige goods) or currencies which {{are more or less}} <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> in the exchange of goods. Usually currencies are found in state-organized societies; large states invariably use currency systems for taxation and payment. Valuables and currencies are much more portable, easily centralized, and they do not lose value through spoilage. The disadvantage is that they cannot be directly consumed; they have to be exchanged in markets for consumption goods. So, if markets are for some reason disrupted, wealth objects and currencies suddenly lose their value.|$|E
50|$|Monetary {{reform was}} {{undertaken}} in early nineties {{to improve the}} stability of the economy. Lithuania chose a currency board system controlled by the Bank of Lithuania independent of any government institution. On 25 June 1993, the Lithuanian litas was introduced as a <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> currency, but on 1 April 1994 it was pegged to the United States dollar at a rate of 4 to 1. The mechanism of the currency board system enabled Lithuania to stabilize inflation rates to single digits. The stable currency rate helped to establish foreign economic relations, therefore leading to a constant growth of foreign trade.|$|E

50|$|The Asian {{financial}} crisis affected China at the margin, mainly through decreased {{foreign direct investment}} and {{a sharp drop in}} the growth of its exports. However, China had huge reserves, a currency that was not <b>freely</b> <b>convertible,</b> and capital inflows that consisted overwhelmingly of long-term investment. For these reasons it remained largely insulated from the regional crisis and its commitment not to devalue had been a major stabilizing factor for the region. However, China faced slowing growth and rising unemployment based on internal problems, including a financial system burdened by huge amounts of bad loans, and massive layoffs stemming from aggressive efforts to reform state-owned enterprises (SOEs).|$|E
50|$|Guinea {{was part}} of the franc zone {{countries}} that included most of the former French Colonies. After Independence, these countries did not become completely economical free. France decided against monetary autonomy hence they could not use a <b>freely</b> <b>convertible</b> currency. The state intervention of the new governments was characterized by stops of quotas on imports and internal price controls. In the time up to c. 1980, the franc-zone countries had on average a lower inflation and a higher economic growth compared to the Anglophone counterparts, who could use their own currencies. But regarding the time after c. 1980 and the economic liberalism, characterized by Structural Adjustments, the franc zone countries could not outperform the rest.|$|E
