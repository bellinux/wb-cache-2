50|$|Raltegravir and <b>elvitegravir</b> {{share the}} same {{mechanism}} of action against integrase: to bind to the active site of Mg2+ ions.

5000|$|In November 2005, {{data from}} a phase 2 study of an investigational HIV {{integrase}} inhibitor, MK-0518, demonstrated that the compound has potent antiviral activity.

5000|$|The {{search for}} new ways to improve {{treatment}} of patients infected with HIV is constant. Considering the experience that has been gathered since the 1980s of ARV drug development arrival of INSTIs as a new potent class of ARV signals a new era in the treatment of HIV. Development of a successful INSTI treatment was accomplished when raltegravir was discovered by Merck Sharp & Dohme Limited. A conditional marketing authorization was licensed in December 2007 by the European Commission which was valid throughout the European Union. In 2009 this authorization was converted to a full marketing authorization and in the same year the FDA changed the approval from accelerated to traditional approval and listed the drug as a first line ARV treatment agent. [...] The second INSTI drug, <b>elvitegravir,</b> was identified by Japan Tobacco and clinical trials began in 2005. In 2011 the drug was still in phase three clinical trials, where it is being compared to raltegravir, in treatment experienced subjects and is also in phase two development in naïve subjects {{as a part of a}} multidrug treatment. S/GSK1349572 is an integrase inhibitor discovered by ViiV/Shinongi which was entering phase three in clinical trials in 2011. This new drug is promising and seems to be well tolerated and so far shows better results than both raltegravir and <b>elvitegravir.</b>|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{discovered}} that over 60 variations of INSTI mutations cause in vivo and in vitro resistance. Due to these mutations and development of resistance the inhibitors are less effective against the virus.Resistance of INI corresponds {{to those of other}} ARV drugs. First IN resistance is caused by primary mutations that decrease INI sensitivity in combination with secondary mutations that further reduce virus sensitivity and/or repair decreased fitness of the virus. Secondly there is a genetic barrier to INI resistance, defined by the number of mutations required for the loss of clinical INI activity. Thirdly there is extensive but incomplete cross-resistance among the INIs.A loop containing amino acid residues 140-149 is located in the catalytic-core domain and is important for IN function as mentioned before. This loop is flexible and even though its role is not quite known it is thought to be important and its functions critical for DNA binding. This resistance appears within mutations in this IN-coding region.The resistance to raltegravir and <b>elvitegravir</b> is primarily due to the same two mutation pathways but other primary mutations are also involved for each of the drugs. Some mutations increase resistance to the drugs to a large extent than others. For example, {{one of the most common}} mutation pathway increases the resistance to raltegravir up to 100 times more than the second most common one.Resistance to Integrase Inhibitor S/GSK1349572 is still being developed and the resistance has not been fully characterized. When it was assessed alongside the primary mutations of raltegravir and <b>elvitegravir</b> it did not show cross-resistance which means that it could be useful against drug resistant viruses.Raltegravir has limited intestinal absorption and thus resistance cannot be overcome by prescribing higher doses. Newer drugs are warranted to overcome this pharmacological disadvantage and gain plasma concentrations high enough to target raltegravir-resistant viruses.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s an {{infectious}} disease started to plague human civilization. The coexistence of viruses and humans {{is a fight}} for survival for both because the invaders can kill the human but in doing so eliminate their own host. The body uses its immune system to protect itself from bacteria, viruses and other disease-causing beings, and when it fails to do so immunodeficiency diseases occur. One such disease is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) which is most commonly {{a result of an}} infection by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).Two closely related types of HIV have been identified, HIV-1 and HIV-2. While HIV-2 is spreading in India and West Africa, HIV-1 is more virulent and the number one cause of AIDS worldwide. Though some of the patients have different results in most cases people infected with HIV go on to develop AIDS and ultimately die of opportunistic infections or cancer.Integration to the retroviral genome is critical for gene expression and viral replication. The viral genome is reversely transcribed into the DNA of the infected cell by viral reverse transcriptase, the DNA is then integrated into the host-cell chromosomes with the aid of the viral integrase. RNA transcripts are produced from integrated viral DNA and serve both as mRNAs to direct the synthesis of viral proteins and later as RNA genomes of the new viral particles.Viral particles escape from the cell by budding from the plasma membrane, each enclosed in a membrane envelope. In this process HIV-1 integrase is essential and therefore a very promising target for anti-AIDS drug design. Selective drug design is a possibility as HIV-1 integrase has no known cellular equivalent. Many integrase inhibitors have been discovered and designed but {{only a few of the}} molecules were developed further and got as far as phase II or phase III of clinical trials. Raltegravir (brand name Isentress) was granted accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2007 and from EMEA (now EMA) in December 2007. [...] It was marketed as an antiretroviral drug (ARV) for HIV-1 infected adults who had already been exposed to a minimum of three ARV classes and showed multi-drug resistance. In general there are two main groups of integrase inhibitors; Integrase Strand Transfer inhibitors (INSTI) and Integrase Binding Inhibitors (INBI). INSTIs restrain the binding of pre-integration complex (PIC) and host DNA and INBIs restrain integrase and viral DNA binding. Raltegravir is an INSTI integrase inhibitor which inhibits both HIV-1 and HIV-2 replication. It is more potent than other previously known integrase inhibitors as well as causing less side effects. Raltegravir, <b>Elvitegravir,</b> and Dolutegravir are the only HIV-1 integrase inhibitor being used to treat HIV infections <b>elvitegravir</b> and S/GSK1349572.|$|E
40|$|Co-formulated <b>elvitegravir,</b> cobicistat, {{tenofovir}} disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine {{is among}} the preferred regimens for first-line ART. A population approach was used to characterize the pharmacokinetics of <b>elvitegravir</b> and cobicistat and identify individual factors and co-medications influencing their disposition, taking into consideration {{the interaction between the}} two compounds. The study population included 144 HIV-infected individuals who provided 186 and 167 <b>elvitegravir</b> and cobicistat plasma concentrations, respectively. First, distinct NONMEM(®) analyses were conducted for <b>elvitegravir</b> and cobicistat, including individual demographic, clinical and genetic factors as potential covariates. <b>Elvitegravir</b> and cobicistat interaction was then assessed through different inhibitory models. Simulations based on the final model served to compare expected drug concentrations under standard and alternative dosage regimens. Clearance with between-subject variability was 7. 6 L/h [coefficient of variation (CV) 16. 6 %] and volume of distribution 61 L for <b>elvitegravir</b> and 16. 0 L/h (CV 41. 9 %) and 88. 3 L, respectively, for cobicistat. Concomitant administration of non-ritonavir-boosted atazanavir decreased <b>elvitegravir</b> clearance by 35 %, likely due to UDP-glucuronosyl transferase (UGT) 1 A 1 inhibition. Concomitant administration of non-ritonavir-boosted atazanavir and ritonavir-boosted darunavir decreased cobicistat clearance by 47 % and 27 %, respectively. The final interaction model included cobicistat exposure (AUC 0 - 24) on <b>elvitegravir</b> clearance. Simulations confirmed that a reduced <b>elvitegravir</b> dose of 85 mg co-administered with cobicistat and atazanavir produces a concentration-time course comparable to the standard regimen without atazanavir. <b>Elvitegravir</b> and cobicistat pharmacokinetic variability appears to be mainly explained by drug-drug interactions that may be encountered in routine clinical practice.

40|$|Background: <b>Elvitegravir</b> is a once daily {{inhibitor}} of HIV- 1 integrase {{boosted by}} ritonavir. We aimed {{to compare the}} efficacy and safety of <b>elvitegravir</b> with raltegravir, another HIV- 1 integrase inhibitor, in patients in whom previous antiretroviral treatment failed. Methods: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, phase 3 study at 234 sites in 13 countries. Eligible patients had plasma HIV RNA of 1000 copies per mL or greater, any CD 4 cell count, and resistance to or 6 months' experience {{with at least two}} classes of antiretroviral drugs. They received an open-label background regimen of a fully active, ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor and a second agent. We randomly allocated patients (1 : 1) by computer with a block size of four to receive either <b>elvitegravir</b> 150 mg once daily (n= 361; 85 mg dose if given with atazanavir, or lopinavir with ritonavir) or raltegravir 400 mg twice daily (n= 363). Placebo tablets were given to mask the difference in daily dosing. The primary endpoint was achievement and maintenance of virological response (HIV RNA < 50 copies per mL) through week 48. Non-inferiority was prespecified with a margin of 10 %. We did a modified intention-to-treat analysis. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials. gov, number NCT 00708162. Findings: Ten patients allocated <b>elvitegravir</b> and 12 assigned raltegravir were excluded from the analysis (either for protocol violations or because they did not receive treatment). 207 (59 %) of 351 patients allocated <b>elvitegravir</b> achieved virological response compared with 203 (58 %) of 351 assigned raltegravir (treatment difference 1 · 1 %, 95 % CI - 6 · 0 to 8 · 2), meeting the criterion for non-inferiority (p= 0 · 001). Three patients allocated <b>elvitegravir</b> had serious adverse events related to study drugs compared with seven assigned raltegravir; two and eight patients died, respectively. More individuals assigned <b>elvitegravir</b> reported diarrhoea up to week 48 (p= 0 · 023), and more patients assigned raltegravir had grade 3 or 4 rises in alanine aminotransferase (p= 0 · 020) or aspartate aminotransferase (p= 0 · 009). Interpretation: <b>Elvitegravir</b> used in combination with a ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitor in treatment-experienced patients has similar efficacy and safety to raltegravir. Since <b>elvitegravir</b> can be given once a day compared with twice a day for raltegravir, <b>elvitegravir</b> might improve patients' adherence. Funding: Gilead Sciences. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background/Aims: The {{antiviral}} drug <b>Elvitegravir</b> {{is used for}} the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infections. The present study explored whether the drug is able to trigger eryptosis, the suicidal death of erythrocytes. Eryptosis is characterized by cell shrinkage and cell membrane scrambling with phosphatidylserine translocation to the erythrocyte surface. Stimulators of eryptosis include increase of cytosolic Ca 2 + activity ([Ca 2 +]i), oxidative stress, ceramide, activated p 38 kinase and activated caspases. The present study explored, whether <b>Elvitegravir</b> induces eryptosis and, if so, to shed light on the mechanisms involved. Methods: Phosphatidylserine abundance at the erythrocyte surface was estimated from annexin-V-binding, cell volume from forward scatter, [Ca 2 +]i from Fluo 3 -fluorescence, abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from DCFDA dependent fluorescence, and ceramide abundance at the erythrocyte surface utilizing specific antibodies. Results: A 48 hours exposure of human erythrocytes to <b>Elvitegravir</b> (≥ 1. 5 µg/ml) significantly increased the percentage of annexin-V-binding cells, and significantly decreased forward scatter. <b>Elvitegravir</b> (2. 5 µg/ml) significantly increased Fluo 3 -fluorescence, but did not significantly modify DCFDA fluorescence or ceramide abundance.
