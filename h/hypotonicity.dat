Like other marine reptiles, sea turtles rely on a specialized gland to rid the body of excess salt ions, because reptilian kidneys cannot produce urine with a higher ion concentration than sea water. All species of sea turtles have a lachrymal gland in the orbital cavity, capable of producing tears with a higher salt concentration than sea water.|$|E
50|$|False {{hyponatremia}}, {{also known}} as spurious, pseudo, hypertonic, or artifactual hyponatremia is when the lab tests read low sodium levels {{but there is no}} <b>hypotonicity.</b> In hypertonic hyponatremia, resorption of water by molecules such as glucose (hyperglycemia or diabetes) or mannitol (hypertonic infusion) occurs. In isotonic hyponatremia a measurement error due to high blood triglyceride level (most common) or paraproteinemia occurs. It occurs when using techniques that measure the amount of sodium in a specified volume of serum/plasma, or that dilute the sample before analysis.|$|E

Severe hypercalcaemia (above 15-16 mg/dL or 3.75-4 mmol/l) is {{considered}} a medical emergency: at these levels, coma and cardiac arrest can result. The high levels of calcium ions decrease the neuron membrane permeability to sodium ions, thus decreasing the excitability, which leads to <b>hypotonicity</b> of smooth and striated muscle. This explains the fatigue, muscle weakness, low tone and sluggish reflexes in muscle groups. The sluggish nerves also explain drowsiness, confusion, hallucinations, stupor and / or coma. In the gut this causes constipation. Hypocalcaemia causes the opposite by the same mechanism.|$|E
50|$|Normal saline (NSS, NS or N/S) is the {{commonly}} used phrase {{for a solution}} of 0.90% w/v of NaCl, 308 mOsm/L or 9.0 g per litre. Less commonly, this solution {{is referred to as}} physiological saline or isotonic saline (because it closely approximates isotonic, that is, physiologically normal, solution); although neither of those names is technically accurate (because normal saline is not exactly like blood serum), they convey the practical effect usually seen: good fluid balance with minimal <b>hypotonicity</b> or hypertonicity. NS is used frequently in intravenous drips (IVs) for patients who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing dehydration or hypovolemia. NS is also used for aseptic purpose. NS is typically the first fluid used when hypovolemia is severe enough to threaten the adequacy of blood circulation, and has long been believed to be the safest fluid to give quickly in large volumes. However, it is now known that rapid infusion of NS can cause metabolic acidosis.|$|E
5000|$|Chronic {{dehydration}} {{needs to}} be treated with zinc as well as with water [...] Zinc reduces cell swelling caused by decreased intake of water (<b>hypotonicity)</b> and also increases retention of salt. In the dehydrated state, the body has too high an osmolarity and, it appears, discards zinc to prevent this. Zinc also regulates transport of the cellular osmolyte taurine, and albumin is known to increase cellular taurine absorption. Zinc has been shown to increase retinol (vitamin A) production from beta-carotene, and in lab experiments retinol reduced human albumin production. It is possible that a retinol (vitamin A) deficiency alone could cause albumin levels to become raised. Patients recovering from chronic dehydration may develop dry eyes as the body uses up its vitamin A store. Retinol causes cells to swell with water (this is most likely one reason that too much vitamin A is toxic). Hyperalbuminemia is also associated with high protein diets.|$|E

The effects of <b>hypotonicity</b> and thrombin on taurine efflux were studied in BC 3 H 1 and C 2 C 12 cells, two mouse myoblastic cell lines that can be induced to differentiate with serum deprivation. In proliferating cultures of both cell types preloaded with [3 H]taurine, exposure to 27 % <b>hypotonicity</b> activated a 10 - to 20 -fold increase in [3 H]taurine efflux (Jtau). This effect was blocked by the C 1 - channel inhibitors NPPB and flufenamic acid. Thrombin and the thrombin receptor agonist SFLLRN also activated Jtau that was abolished by NPPB and flufenamic acid. Together, <b>hypotonicity</b> and thrombin synergistically activated Jtau. In differentiated myocytes, the effect of thrombin was abolished, while that of <b>hypotonicity</b> was significantly reduced.

40|$|Kidney collecting-duct cells swell in {{response}} to changes in medulla osmolality caused by the transition from antidiuresis to diuresis. Regulatory volume decrease (RVD) mechanisms must be activated to face this hypotonic stress. In Aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) -expressing renal CD 8 cells, <b>hypotonicity</b> decreased cell surface expression of AQP 2 and increased the amount of AQP 2 localized intracellularly, whereas {{the total amount of}} AQP 2 phosphorylated at ser- 256 decreased. Analysis of cAMP dynamics using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) showed that <b>hypotonicity</b> causes a reduction of cAMP, consistent with a decrease in phospho-AQP 2. Moreover, <b>hypotonicity</b> caused a profound actin reorganization, associated with the loss of stress fibers and formation of F-actin patches (microspikes) at the cell border. Those changes were regulated by the monomeric GTPase Cdc 42. Interestingly, expression of the dominant-negative Cdc 42 (N 17 -Cdc 42) prevented the hypotonicity-induced microspike formation and the generation of Cl(-) currents. <b>Hypotonicity</b> also caused the relocation from the cytosol to the plasma membrane and increase in interaction with actin of ICln (nucleotide-sensitive chloride current protein), which is essential for the generation of ion currents activated during RVD. Together, the profound actin remodeling, internalization of AQP 2 and translocation of ICln to the plasma membrane during <b>hypotonicity</b> may contribute to RVD after cell swelling in renal medulla...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which extracellular <b>hypotonicity</b> stimulates release of renin from juxtaglomerular (JG) cells is unknown. We hypothesized that osmotically induced renin release depends on water movement through aquaporin- 1 (AQP 1) water channels and subsequent prostanoid formation. We recorded membrane capacitance (Cm) by whole-cell patch clamp in single JG cells as an index of exocytosis. <b>Hypotonicity</b> increased Cm significantly and enhanced outward current. Indomethacin, PLA 2 inhibition, and an antagonist of prostaglandin transport impaired the Cm and current responses to <b>hypotonicity.</b> <b>Hypotonicity</b> also increased exocytosis as determined by a decrease in single JG cell quinacrine fluorescence in an indomethacin-sensitive manner. In single JG cells from COX- 2 −/ − and AQP 1 −/ − mice, <b>hypotonicity</b> increased neither Cm nor outward current, but 0. 1 -μM PGE 2 increased both in these cells. A reduction in osmolality enhanced cAMP accumulation in JG cells but not in renin-producing As 4. 1 cells; only the former had detectable AQP 1 expression. Inhibition of protein kinase A blocked the hypotonicity-induced Cm and current response in JG cells. Taken together, our results show that a 5 to 7 % decrease in extracellular tonicity leads to AQP 1 -mediated water influx in JG cells, PLA 2 /COX- 2 -mediated prostaglandin-dependent formation of cAMP, and activation of PKA, which promotes exocytosis of renin...|$|E
40|$|Neuroendocrine {{secretory}} vesicles discharge their cargo {{in response}} to a stimulus, but the nature of this event is poorly understood. We studied the release of the pituitary hormone prolactin by <b>hypotonicity,</b> because this hormone also contributes to osmoregulation. In perfused rat lactotrophs, <b>hypotonicity</b> resulted in a transient increase followed by a sustained depression of prolactin release, as monitored by radioimmunoassay. In single cells imaged by confocal microscopy, <b>hypotonicity</b> elicited discharge of the fluorescently labeled atrial natriuretic peptide cargo from ∼ 2 % of vesicles/cell. In contrast, KCl-induced depolarization resulted in a response of ∼ 10 % of vesicles/cell, with different unloading/loading time course of the two fluorescent probes. In cell-attached studies, discrete changes in membrane capacitance were recorded in both unstimulated and stimulated conditions, reflecting single vesicle fusion/fissions with the plasma membrane. In stimulated cells, the probability of occurrence of full fusion events was low and unchanged, whereas over 95 % of fusion events were transient, with the open fusion pore probability, the average pore dwell-time, the frequency of occurrence, and the fusion pore conductance increased. <b>Hypotonicity</b> only rarely elicited new fusion events in silent membrane patches.

We previously reported that the excitability of nociceptor was increased by hypotonic stimulation. The present study tested the effect of <b>hypotonicity</b> on tetrodotoxin-sensitive sodium current (TTX-S current) in cultured trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. Our data show that after hypotonic treatment, TTX-S current was increased. In the presence of <b>hypotonicity,</b> voltage-dependent activation curve shifted to the hyperpolarizing direction, while the voltagedependent inactivation curve was not affected. Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 4 receptor (TRPV 4) activator increased TTX-S current and hypotonicity-induced increase was markedly attenuated by TRPV 4 receptor blockers. We also demonstrate that inhibition of PKC attenuated hypotonicity-induced inhibition, whereas PKA system was not involved in hypotonic-response. We conclude that hypotonic stimulation enhances TTX-S current, which contributes to hypotonicity-induced nociception. TRPV 4 receptor and PKC intracellular pathway are involved in the increase of TTX-S current by <b>hypotonicity...</b>|$|E

Very little is, on the other hand, known about the effects of long-term <b>hypotonicity</b> on expression and function of KCNK 5, thus we have investigated the effect of long-term <b>hypotonicity</b> (24 h - 48 h) on KCNK 5 in Ehrlich cells on the mRNA, protein and physiological levels. Methods: Physiological effects of long-term <b>hypotonicity</b> were measured using patch-clamp and Coulter counter techniques. Expression patterns of KCNK 5 on mRNA and protein levels were established using real-time qPCR and western blotting respectively. Results: The maximum swelling-activated current through KCNK 5 was significantly decreased upon 48 h of <b>hypotonicity</b> and likewise the RVD response was significantly impaired after both 24 and 48 h of hypotonic stimulation. No significant differences in the KCNK 5 mRNA expression patterns between control and stimulated cells were observed, but a significant decrease in the KCNK 5 protein level 48 h after stimulation was found. Conclusion: The data suggest that the strong physiological impairment of KCNK 5 in Ehrlich cells after long-term hypotonic stimulation is predominantly due to down-regulation of the KCNK 5 protein synthesis...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of protein}} {{tyrosine}} phosphorylation and of G proteins in the activation of a swelling-activated Cl− current (ICl,swell) in calf pulmonary artery endothelial (CPAE) cells was studied using the whole-cell patch clamp technique. ICl,swell was activated {{by reducing the}} extracellular osmolality by either 12. 5 % (mild <b>hypotonicity)</b> or 25 % (strong <b>hypotonicity).</b> The protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) inhibitors tyrphostin B 46, tyrphostin A 25 and genistein inhibited ICl,swell with IC 50 values of, respectively, 9. 2 ± 0. 2, 61. 4 ± 1. 7 and 62. 9 ± 1. 3 μM. Tyrphostin A 1, a tyrphostin analogue with little effect on PTK activity, and daidzein, an inactive genistein analogue, were without effect on ICl,swell. The protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors Na 3 VO 4 (200 μM) and dephostatin (20 μM) potentiated ICl,swell activated by mild <b>hypotonicity</b> by 47 ± 9 and 69 ± 15 %, respectively. Intracellular perfusion with GTPγS (100 μM) transiently activated a Cl− current with an identical biophysical and pharmacological profile to ICl,swell. This current was inhibited by the tested PTK inhibitors and potentiated by the PTP inhibitors. Hypertonicity-induced cell shrinkage completely inhibited the GTPγS-activated Cl− current. Intracellular perfusion with GDPβS (1 mM) caused a time-dependent inhibition of ICl,swell, which was more pronounced when the current was activated by mild <b>hypotonicity.</b> Our results demonstrate that the activity of endothelial swelling-activated Cl− channels is dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation and suggest that G proteins regulate the sensitivity to cell swelling...|$|E

To investigate this mechanism in the liver, we studied the release of free amino acids from isolated perfused rat liver during <b>hypotonicity.</b> The osmolarity of the perfusion medium was reduced from 305 to 255 or 205 mosM by decreasing the NaCl concentration 25 or 50 mM, respectively.

40|$|The {{identification}} of osmo/mechanosensory proteins in mammalian sensory neurons is still elusive. We have used an expression cloning approach to screen a human {{dorsal root ganglion}} cDNA library to look for proteins that respond to <b>hypotonicity</b> by raising the intracellular Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]i). We report the unexpected {{identification of}} GAP 43 (also known as neuromodulin or B 50), a membrane-anchored neuronal protein implicated in axonal growth and synaptic plasticity, as an osmosensory protein that augments [Ca 2 +]i in response to <b>hypotonicity.</b> Palmitoylation of GAP 43 {{plays an important role}} in the protein osmosensitivity. Depletion of intracellular stores or inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) activity abrogates hypotonicity-evoked, GAP 43 -mediated [Ca 2 +]i elevations. Notably, <b>hypotonicity</b> promoted the selective association of GAP 43 with the PLC-δ 1 isoform, and a concomitant increase in inositol- 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) formation. Collectively, these findings indicate that hypo-osmotic activation of GAP 43 induces Ca 2 + release from IP 3 -sensitive intracellular stores. The osmosensitivity of GAP 43 furnishes a mechanistic framework that links axon elongation with phospho inositide metabolism, spontaneous triggering of cytosolic Ca 2 + transients and the regulation of actin dynamics and motility at the growth cone in response to temporal and local mechanical forces...|$|E

40|$|We {{previously}} reported that ATP release from 1321 N 1 human astrocytoma cells could be stimulated either by activation of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) or by hypotonic stress. Cheema et al. (Cheema TA, Ward CE, Fisher SK. J Pharmacol Exp Ther 315 : 755 – 763, 2005) {{have demonstrated that}} thrombin activation of protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR 1) in 1321 N 1 cells and primary astrocytes acts synergistically with hypotonic stress to gate the opening of volume-sensitive organic osmolyte and anion channels (VSOAC) and that hypertonic stress strongly inhibits PAR 1 gating of VSOAC. We tested the hypothesis that a VSOAC-type permeability might comprise a GPCR-regulated pathway for ATP export by determining whether PAR 1 -sensitive ATP release from 1321 N 1 cells is similarly potentiated by <b>hypotonicity</b> but suppressed by hypertonic conditions. Strong hypotonic stress by itself elicited ATP release and positively modulated the response to thrombin. Thrombin-dependent ATP release was also potentiated by mild hypotonic stress that by itself did not stimulate ATP export. Notably, PAR 1 -sensitive ATP export was greatly inhibited in hypertonic medium. Neither the potency nor efficacy of thrombin as an activator of proximal PAR 1 signaling was affected by <b>hypotonicity</b> or hypertonicity. 1, 9 -Dideoxyforskolin and carbenoxolone similarly attenuated PAR 1 -dependent ATP release and suppressed the PAR 1 -independent ATP elicited by strong hypotonic stress. Probenecid attenuated PAR 1 -stimulated ATP release under isotonic but not mild hypotonic conditions and {{had no effect on}} PAR 1 -independent release stimulated by strong <b>hypotonicity.</b> PAR 1 -dependent ATP export under all osmotic conditions required concurrent signaling by Ca 2 + mobilization and Rho-GTPase activation. In contrast, PAR 1 -independent ATP release triggered by strong <b>hypotonicity</b> required neither of these intracellular signals. Thus, we provide the new finding that GPCR-regulated ATP release from 1321 N 1 astrocytoma cells is remarkably sensitive to both positive and negative modulation by extracellular osmolarity. This supports a model wherein GPCR stimulation and osmotic stress converge on an ATP release pathway in astrocytes that exhibits several features of VSOAC-type channels...|$|E

40|$|The {{syndrome}} {{of inappropriate}} antidiuretic hormone secretion {{is characterized by}} excessive water uptake and hyponatremia. The extent of hyponatremia, however, is less than anticipated, which is ascribed to a defense mechanism, the vasopressin-escape, and is suggested to involve a tonicity-determined down-regulation of the water channel aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2). The underlying mechanism, however, is poorly understood. To study this, we used the mouse cortical collecting duct (mpkCCD) cell line. MpkCCD cells, transfected with an AQP 2 -promoter luciferase construct showed a reduced and increased AQP 2 abundance and transcription following culture in hypotonic and hypertonic medium, respectively. This depended on tonicity rather than osmolality and occurred independently of the vasopressin analog dDAVP, cAMP levels, or protein kinase A activity. Although prostaglandins and nitric oxide reduced AQP 2 abundance, inhibition of their synthesis did not influence tonicity-induced AQP 2 transcription. Also, cells in which the cAMP or tonicity-responsive element (CRE/TonE) in the AQP 2 -promoter were mutated showed a similar response to <b>hypotonicity.</b> Instead, the tonicity-responsive elements were pin-pointed to nucleotides - 283 to - 252 and - 157 to - 126 bp. In conclusion, our data indicate that <b>hypotonicity</b> reduces AQP 2 abundance and transcription, which occurs independently of vasopressin, cAMP, and the known TonE and CRE in the AQP 2 -promoter. Increased prostaglandin and nitric oxide, as found in vivo, may contribute to reduced AQP 2 in vasopressin-escape, but do not mediate the effect of <b>hypotonicity</b> on AQP 2 transcription.

In the islets, 5 -nitro- 2 -(3 - phenylpropylamino) benzoic acid (NPPB) and 5 -chloro- 2 -hydroxy- 3 -(thiophene- 2 - carbonyl) indole- 1 -carboxamide (tenidap) reduced glucose-stimulated insulin release, however, only NPPB suppressed the enhancing action of cAMP analogs upon such a release. Insulin output from the BRIN-BD 11 cells was stimulated by 2 -ketoisocaproate (KIC) or extracellular hypoosmolarity. cAMP analogs and 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine increased the insulin output recorded in the isotonic medium to a greater relative extent than that in the hypotonic medium. The secretory response to KIC or <b>hypotonicity</b> was inhibited by NPPB or tenidap, which both also opposed the enhancing action of cAMP analogs. Inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase decreased insulin output in isotonic and hypotonic media. The inhibitor of sAC, 2 -hydroxyestriol, caused only a modest inhibition of insulin release, whether in the isotonic or hypotonic medium, even when tested at a concentration of 100 μM.

Erythrocytes of the skate (Raja erinacea) exposed to hypotonic stress swell and then undergo a volume regulatory decrease by releasing taurine and other osmolytes.

In WT mice, forskolin activated a linear Cl(-) current only in distal convoluted and cortical collecting tubule cells. This current was not recorded in KO mice. In both mice, Ca(2 +) -dependent Cl(-) currents were recorded in all segments. In WT mice, volume-sensitive Cl(-) currents were implicated in regulatory volume decrease during <b>hypotonicity.</b> In KO mice, regulatory volume decrease and swelling-activated Cl(-) current were impaired but were restored by adenosine perfusion. Extracellular ATP also restored swelling-activated Cl(-) currents. The effect of ATP or adenosine was blocked by 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -diproxylxanthine. The ecto-ATPase inhibitor ARL- 67156 inhibited the effect of <b>hypotonicity</b> and ATP. Finally, in KO mice, volume-sensitive Cl(-) currents are potentially functional, but the absence of CFTR precludes their activation by extracellular nucleosides. This observation strengthens the hypothesis that CFTR is a modulator of ATP release in epithelia...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} syndrome of a 65 -year-old {{patient with}} a slit-shaped right-sided meso-diencephalic lesion was analysed. A cerebellar syndrome with limb-kinetic ataxia, intention tremor and <b>hypotonicity</b> in all extremities as well as ataxic dysarthria was found. The disruption of the two cerebello-(rubro) -thalamic pathways probably explained the signs of bilateral cerebellar dysfunction. The uncrossed ascending limb of the right, and the crossed one of the left brachium conjunctivum may have been damaged by the unilateral lesion extending between caudal midbrain and dorsal thalamus...|$|E
