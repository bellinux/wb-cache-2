30|$|Smaller dozers will exert less {{compaction}} than larger dozers {{and should}} be used for spreading and grading of topsoil as a means of avoiding soil compaction during reclamation. Surface materials should be spread and graded when in a relatively dry condition.

50|$|Most of {{the creek}} {{watershed}} is in forest (42%) and agricultural uses (40% pasture and <b>hay</b> <b>land</b> and 12% cropland). In 2002, there were 1,825 beef cows, 675 milk cows, 720 horses, 25 hogs, 30 sheep, and 110,500 poultry animals housed in the watershed. Residential and urban uses occupy about 6% of the watershed area. As of 1997, there were 3,640 people using septic systems in the watershed. Treated effluent from Sweetwater's sewage treatment plant is discharged to the stream. The stream is considered to have impaired water quality due to elevated levels of fecal coliform bacteria, nitrates, and sediment, which are attributed to factors including sewage effluent discharge, grazing and concentrated feeding of farm animals, land development, and channelization.|$|E

40|$|Afforestation trends were {{compared}} between two continentally-distinct, yet similar ecoregions to characterize similarities or differences in forest advancement due to natural and anthropogenic forcings. Temporal changes in forest cover {{were analyzed using}} high resolution aerial and satellite photographs for Southeast Iowa, USA, and satellite photographs for the western Belgorod Oblast, Russia. An increase in forested area was shown to occur over a 44 -year period from 1970 – 2014 in Iowa where afforestation was reflected by the aggregation of smaller forest units. In the Belgorod region the opposite occurred in {{that there was an}} increase in the number of smaller forested units. The rate of forest expansion into open grassland areas, previously used as <b>haying</b> <b>lands</b> and pastures, was 14 m decade− 1 and 8 m decade− 1 in Iowa and the Belgorod Oblast, respectively. Based on current trends, predicted times for complete forest coverage in the study areas was estimated to be 80 years in Iowa and 300 years in the Belgorod Oblast. In both the Iowa and Belgorod Oblast, there was an increase in annual precipitation at the end of the 20 th and the beginning of the 21 st centuries, thus providing a contributing mechanism to forest advancement in the study regions and implications for future management practices...|$|R

40|$|In Southwest Alberta, {{beef cattle}} and wild elk (Cervus elaphus) have similar habitat prefer-ences. Understanding their inter-species contact {{structure}} {{is important for}} assessing therisk of pathogen transmission between them. These spatio-temporal patterns of interac-tions are shaped, in part, by range management and environmental factors affecting elkdistribution. In this study, resource selection modeling was used to identify factors influ-encing elk presence on cattle pasture and elk selection of foraging patches; furthermore,consequences for inter-species disease transmission were discussed. Data on pasture management practices and observations of elk were collected from 15 ranchers during interviews. Pasture use by elk was defined based on telemetry data (fromGPS collars deployed on 168 elk in 7 herds) and rancher observations. At the patch scale,foraging patches used by elk were identified by spatio-temporal cluster analysis of teleme-try data, whereas available patches were randomly generated outside the area delimitedby used patches. For pastures and patches, landscape and human-managed features werecharacterized using remote sensing data and interviews, respectively. Attributes of avail-able and used pastures (or patches) were compared using resource selection functions, onannual and seasonal (or annual and monthly) time scales. Additionally, intensity of pastureuse was modeled using negative binomial regression. Cultivated <b>hay</b> <b>land</b> and mineral supplements were associated with elk presence on cat-tle pastures, whereas pastures with manure fertilization and higher traffic-weighted roaddensities {{were less likely to}} be used by elk. The effects of landscape (elevation, aspect, wateraccess) and vegetation (forest cover, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) characteris-tics on patch selection were consistent with typical elk habitat requirements. The presenceof cattle and the traffic-weighted road density were negatively associated with patch selec-tion. The apparent avoidance of cattle by elk reduced the risk of direct transmission ofpathogens, except during winter months. However, human-managed features attractingelk to cattle pastures (e. g. <b>hay</b> <b>land</b> and mineral supplements) may increase inter-speciespathogen transmission through indirect contacts...|$|E
30|$|During SMCRA’s early years, {{regulatory}} authorities encouraged grading and smoothing of reclaimed land, and rapid establishment of grasses and legumes (Plass 1982; Torbert and Burger 2000; Angel et al. 2005). Plant species commonly used for revegetation were agricultural forages, such as fescue grasses (Festuca surfaces spp.) and clovers (Trifolium spp.), and were often chosen because they satisfied the major reclamation objectives {{as perceived by}} regulators at the time. These forage species stabilized the surface and controlled soil erosion; established quickly; and enabled a quick economic return to land owners who used the post-mining lands for hay production or livestock grazing; were inexpensive and easy to establish; and were considered as aesthetically pleasing (Boyce 1999). This reclamation procedure was often described in SMCRA permits as a <b>hay</b> <b>land</b> or pasture post-mining land uses.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} be {{suitable}} for <b>hay</b> <b>land</b> and pasture uses, reclaimed mined lands should have smooth soil surfaces, soil materials that are well suited for agricultural grass and legume species, and moderate slopes. Because of operating requirements of managing and harvesting equipment, slopes of 15  % or less are generally preferred for hay lands. While pasture land can be placed on steeper areas, slope limitations still apply due to the operational needs of agricultural equipment necessary for effective pasture management such as fertilization, liming, over-seeding, and undesirable plant control. When establishing pastures on mined areas, {{it is essential to}} provide a water source. One study has found that cattle utilize pastures readily if they are within 240  m of a water source; but pastures beyond that distance are not be well utilized (Ditsch et al. 2006).|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] The distribution of wetlands in the San Luis Valley has been altered by human modifications that influence the timing, distribution and characteristics of wetland environments available to wetland dependent species. I examined the hydrologic regime, vegetation community composition and structure and waterbird use of seasonal wet meadow and temporary playa wetlands located on public and private land subject to idle, grazing and <b>haying</b> <b>land</b> management practices. Results indicated that wetlands located on public land contained water earlier and for longer durations than private land. Although vegetation community composition was similar across analogous habitat types, seasonal wet meadow public-idle sites maintained greater vegetation cover and vertical density than private sites, while temporary playa sites showed similar vegetation characteristics across land management practices. Overall, most waterbirds were observed during May. Waterbird use of study sites was highly variable across time, wetland type and land management practice with dabbling ducks more frequently observed on seasonal wet meadow public-idle sites and shorebirds on temporary playa private-grazed sites. Recognizing how different ownership and land management practices influence wetland distribution and quality is critical in establishing the appropriate habitat based goals and objectives to meet conservation needs...|$|R
