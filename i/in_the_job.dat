5|$|After an inauspicious {{start as}} an actor, Cibber {{eventually}} became a popular comedian, wrote and adapted many plays, and rose {{to become one of}} the newly empowered businessmen-managers. He took over the management of Drury Lane in 1710 and took a highly commercial, if not artistically successful, line <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> In 1730, he was made Poet Laureate, an appointment which attracted widespread scorn, particularly from Alexander Pope and other Tory satirists. Off-stage, he was a keen gambler, and was one of the investors in the South Sea Company.|$|E
5|$|Brian Little, {{formerly}} {{manager of}} Aston Villa, took {{charge for the}} 1998–99 season, and Stoke began the season impressively, holding first place until December with six straight wins. The team's form tailed off in the latter stages of the season, leading to Little's departure {{at the end of}} the season. His successor, Gary Megson, was only <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> for four months. Megson was forced to depart following a takeover by Stoke Holding, an Icelandic consortium that purchased a 66 percent share in Stoke City F.C. for £6.6m.

Bernard Joy moved into journalism following his football career, and authored the club's first detailed history book, Forward, Arsenal! Ronnie Rooke made 94 appearances for Arsenal and scored 70 goals; at a goalscoring rate of 0.745, he is the club's second-most prolific goalscorer.|$|E

5|$|Education was {{provided}} for the children, but workhouse teachers were a particular problem. Poorly paid, without any formal training, and facing large classes of unruly children {{with little or no}} interest in their lessons, few stayed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> {{for more than a few}} months. In an effort to force workhouses to offer at least a basic level of education, legislation was passed in 1845 requiring that all pauper apprentices should be able to read and sign their own indenture papers. A training college for workhouse teachers was set up at Kneller Hall in Twickenham during the 1840s, but it closed in the following decade.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the persistence of}} regular and non-regular employment status in Japan for workers that change jobs.

5|$|Wyatt {{only served}} as deputy sheriff for eastern Pima County {{for about three}} months because, in November, Democrat Shibell ran for {{re-election}} against Republican challenger Bob Paul.

5|$|As {{the end of}} his Northwestern career {{approached}} in November 1963, Parseghian called Father Edmund Joyce, the vice president and chairman of the athletics board at Notre Dame, a Catholic university near South Bend, Indiana.

When Joyce said the university was searching for a new coach, Parseghian expressed interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> Joyce did not immediately seem warm to the idea, however, and Parseghian explored an offer to coach at the University of Miami, where his old friend Andy Gustafson had been promoted from head coach to athletic director. Notre Dame was also considering Dan Devine for its coaching job, but ultimately offered it to Parseghian. Parseghian waffled at first, recalling his father's dislike of Catholics who had {{played a role in the}} Armenian deportations, but accepted in December and was given a salary of about $20,000 a year ($ today).|$|E
5|$|Diem {{appointed}} Bui Van Luong—a {{family friend}} and devout Catholic—as {{the head of}} COMIGAL, the government resettlement agency. COMIGAL worked {{in cooperation with the}} United States Operations Mission, the non-military wing of the American presence and the Military Assistance Advisory Group. Although COMIGAL was purely dedicated to refugee issues, there was a constant turnover of public servants through their staff, and the benefits of continuity did not materialize. After only a few months <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> Luong was replaced by Pham Van Huyen on December 7, 1954. COMIGAL were supplemented by American Catholic aid agencies and an advisory group from Michigan State University, where Diem had stayed while in self-imposed exile in the early 1950s. There were three phases in the resettlement program. With more than 4,000new arrivals per day, the northerners were housed in Saigon and Vũng Tàu in 42 makeshift reception centers. These consisted of existing schools, vacated French barracks, churches and tent cities on the grounds of Tan Son Nhut Air Base and Phú Thọ Racecourse. These could not be used indefinitely as the grounds needed to be used for their preexisting purpose, and furthermore, such ad hoc areas were vulnerable to outbreaks of fire and disease.|$|E

Burley dropped Barry Ferguson and Allan McGregor from the team for a qualifying match against Iceland after it was reported they had been drinking through {{the night at the}} team hotel.

5|$|In 1611, James {{employed}} Calvert {{to research}} and transcribe his tract against the Dutch Protestant theologian Conrad Vorstius (1569–1622). The following year, Cecil died, and Calvert acted {{as one of the}} four executors of his will. The king's favourite, Sir Robert Carr, first Earl of Somerset (1587–1645), Viscount Rochester, assumed the duties of secretary of state and recruited Calvert to assist with foreign policy, in particular the Latin and Spanish correspondence. Carr, soon raised to the earldom of Somerset, was not a success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> and fell from favour {{partly as a result of}} the murder of Thomas Overbury (1581–1613), to which Carr's wife Frances, the former Countess of Essex and later Somerset (1590–1632), pleaded guilty in 1615. Carr's place as James's principal favourite was now taken by the handsome George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham (1592–1628), with whom James was said to have been infatuated.|$|E
5|$|Revie {{was offered}} a five-year £100,000 {{contract}} (plus £50,000 signing-on fee) by Everton in the summer, but remained with Leeds after the move broke down due to a new law introduced in Parliament that prevented wage rises to curb inflation. He chose to continue with largely the same line-up for the 1973–74 season. He told his squad that the aim for the season would be to go unbeaten throughout the campaign. Though Leeds failed to achieve this as they lost three successive games in February/March, they did secure the title with a five-point lead over Liverpool. Completely focused on the league, and finally accepting that he was asking too much of his players to try and win every competition he played weakened teams to allow an early exit from the UEFA Cup. He chose {{to take the job}} of England national football team manager ahead of leading a European Cup challenge at Leeds and breaking up the ageing team he had stuck with for many years, and though he was well loved at the club he was not popular with the Leeds boardroom members, who appointed Brian Clough, a fierce critic of Revie as his successor. Despite lasting just 44 days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> Clough spent more in transfer fees than Revie had in his 13 years at the club.|$|E
