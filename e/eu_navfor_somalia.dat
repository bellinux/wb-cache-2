50|$|<b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> <b>Somalia,</b> {{also known}} as Operation Atalanta, is a current counter-piracy {{military}} operation at sea off the Horn of Africa and in the Western Indian Ocean, {{that is the first}} undertaken by the European Union Naval Force. The operational headquarters is located at Northwood Headquarters in the UK.|$|E
50|$|Currently {{there are}} three {{international}} naval task forces in the region, with numerous national vessels and task forces entering and leaving the region, engaging in counter-piracy operations for various lengths of time. The three international task forces which compose the bulk of counter-piracy operations are Combined Task Force 150 (whose overarching mission is Operation Enduring Freedom), Combined Task Force 151 (which {{was set up in}} 2009 specifically to run counter-piracy operations) and the EU naval task force operating under Operation Atalanta. All counter-piracy operations are coordinated through a monthly planning conference called Shared Awareness and Deconfliction (SHADE). Originally having representatives only from NATO, the EU, and the Combined Maritime Forces (CMF) HQ in Bahrain, it now regularly attracts representatives from over 20 countries.As part of the international effort, Europe plays a significant role in combating piracy off the coast of the Horn of Africa. The European Union under the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) launched <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> <b>Somalia</b> - Operation Atalanta (in support of Resolutions 1814 (2008), 1816 (2008), 1838 (2008) and 1846 (2008) of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC)). This operation is working to protect humanitarian aid and reduce the disruption to the shipping routes and the de-stabilising of the maritime environment in the region. To date, 26 countries have brought some kind of contribution to the operation. 13 EU Member States have provided an operational contribution to EU NAVFOR, either with ships, with maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft, or with Vessel Protection Detachment (VPD) team. This includes France, Spain, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Netherlands, Italy, Belgium, United Kingdom (also hosting the EU NAVFOR Operational headquarters), Portugal, Luxembourg, Malta and Estonia. 9 other EU Member States have participated in the effort providing military staff to work at the EU NAVFOR Operational Headquarters (Northwood Headquarters - UK) or onboard units. These are Cyprus, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Ireland and Finland. Finally, 4 non-EU Member States, Norway (which has also provided an operational contribution with a warship regularly deploying), Croatia, Ukraine and Montenegro, have so far also brought their contribution to EU NAVFOR.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{contemporary}} problem of Somali maritime hijackings from the European Union perspective. First, it presents the problem per se while focusing on the framework in which the piracy issue is being solved. Second, it analyses {{the role of the}} post-Lisbon European Union in international crisis management. Taking EU's first naval military mission <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> <b>Somalia</b> "Atalanta" as a case study, the paper essentially aims at shedding some light on {{the current state of the}} European Union's recognition as a major actor in international politics.

40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} dealing with the issue of cooperation between the European Union and the non-EU NATO members. The comparison was chosen as a method of the research. The thesis compares reasons, which make the Turkey and Norway's basis for taking part in the EU missions or in the European Defence Agency. These two states were chosen because they are comprehensively different {{and at the same time}} fulfil the conditions of being the non-EU NATO members. The cooperation and the reasons are mentioned in examples of the European Defence Agency and three missions - EUFOR Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina, EUFOR RD Congo and <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> <b>Somalia</b> in Somali waters. The last chapter is the comparison, which compares the reasons and draws the conclusion that the reasons come primarily from the both states' different foreign policies. The Turkish foreign policy leading to higher participation follows its geopolitical interests and Norway's foreign policy comes from its peace initiative...|$|E
50|$|Norway {{announced}} on 27 February 2009, {{that it would}} send the frigate HNoMS Fridtjof Nansen to the coast of Somalia to fight piracy. Royal Norwegian Navy Fridtjof Nansen joined <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR's</b> international naval force in August.|$|R

50|$|In May 2012, <b>EU</b> <b>Navfor</b> {{conducted}} {{their first}} raid on pirate bases on the Somali mainland, destroying 5 pirate boats. The EU forces were transported by helicopter to the bases near {{the port of}} Harardhere, a well-known pirate lair. The operation was carried out with {{the full support of}} the Somali government.|$|R
50|$|The EU {{seeks to}} {{increase}} the scope of <b>EU</b> <b>Navfor</b> Med so that a third phase of the operation would include patrols inside Libyan waters in order to capture and dispose of vessels used by smugglers. Land operations on Libya to destroy vessels used by smugglers had been proposed, but commentators note that such an operation would need a UN or Libyan permit.|$|R
50|$|Participation in <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> {{goes beyond}} <b>EU</b> member states. Norway {{was the first}} non-EU country to {{contribute}} to the Operation, with a warship in 2009. Thereafter, Montenegro, Serbia and Ukraine have provided staff officers to the Operational Headquarters (OHQ) and Force Headquarters (FHQ). Ukraine contributed a warship early in 2014, and New Zealand contributed an MPRA asset later the same year.|$|R
50|$|The EU is {{assisting}} the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crime (UNODC) {{in their work}} to establish sufficient conditions to allow fair and efficient piracy trials in Somalia. The EU is the largest contributor to the UNODC counter-piracy programme. In the short term, transfers for trial from <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> ships remain necessary {{to put an end}} to impunity in the Indian Ocean.|$|R
50|$|Piracy {{has to be}} {{understood}} as organised criminal activity occurring at sea. It is organised on land, with kidnapping crews and ships for ransom as the business model.

40|$|This volume enquires into {{selected}} {{legal problems}} that the EU’s contribution to human rights protection in the world entails, taking into consideration not only the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), but also other aspects of EU external action, such as development cooperation and the Common Commercial Policy. Hence, the title: ‘Protecting Human Rights in the European Union’s External Relations’. In a nutshell, the themes investigated are the following: the limits to the Commission’s discretion in exercising administrative powers {{in the implementation of}} the EU’s human rights policy; and {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} selected legal instruments - such as human rights clauses in EU agreements, the Council guidelines on human rights, and unilateral measures such as trade incentives - used to promote respect for human rights. Two papers specifically focus on the promotion of social rights, labour standards and good governance practices in the world. The final research theme, explored by the last two pieces, concerns the international responsibility of the EU and/or its Member States when breaches of human rights are committed in the course of CSDP military missions, in particular Operations <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> Med Sophia and <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> Atalanta...|$|R

50|$|On 14 April 2009, the French frigate Nivôse {{attached}} to Operation Atalanta, captured 11 suspected pirates, {{together with their}} mother ship and two skiffs, in an <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> focused operation {{carried out in the}} Indian Ocean. The French ship responded to the distress message by the 21,000 tonne Liberia flagged MV Safmarine Asia which came under small arms and RPG attack from two skiffs operating from a pirate mother ship. The warship deployed its helicopter, which quickly arrived on the scene, to deter the hijacking and shadow the mother vessel until the frigate arrived.|$|R
50|$|At any one time, the European force size fluctuates {{according}} to the monsoon seasons, which determine the level of piracy. It typically consists of 5 to 10 surface combatants (naval ships), 1 to 2 auxiliary ships and 2 to 4 maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft. Including land-based personnel, Operation Atalanta consists {{of a total of}} around 2,000 military personnel. <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> operates in a zone comprising the south of the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and {{the western part of the}} Indian Ocean including the Seychelles, which represents an area of 2,000,000 square nautical miles.|$|R

During the night action, the warship moved between Izumi and Petra to protect its escort and used only [...] "minimal force" [...] to deter the pirates out of concern for the hostages.

50|$|On 3 August 2010, the Norwegian {{chemical}} tanker MV Bow Saga was proceeding through the transit corridor {{in the middle}} of the Gulf of Aden when it came under attack. A pirate skiff with 7 people on board shot at the bridge, damaging the windows. <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> heard her distress call and ordered the closest warship, the Spanish frigate SPS Victoria react to the incident. Victoria already had her helicopter in the air and was able to intervene only ten minutes after the call. The pirates stopped the attack and tried to flee. After warning shots, first from the helicopter and then from the warship Victoria, the pirates eventually stopped. The skiff was searched by a boarding team from Victoria and weapons were subsequently found.|$|R
5000|$|On 18 May 2015, the European Union {{decided to}} launch a new {{operation}} based in Rome, called <b>EU</b> <b>Navfor</b> Med, {{under the command of}} the Italian Admiral Enrico Credendino, to undertake systematic efforts to identify, capture and dispose of vessels used by migrant smugglers. The first phase of the operation, launched on 22 June, involved naval surveillance to detect smugglers' boats and monitor smuggling patterns from Libya towards Italy and Malta. The second phase, called [...] "Operation Sophia", started in October, and was aimed at disrupting the smugglers' journeys by boarding, searching, seizing and diverting migrant vessels in international waters. The operation uses six EU warships. As of April 2016, more than 13,000 migrants were rescued from the sea and 68 alleged smugglers were arrested {{in the course of the}} operation.|$|R

40|$|Are parliaments {{with strong}} formal powers for the {{deployment}} of troops likely to conduct more intensive oversight than their counterparts with weak or no powers? The literature suggests that strong formal powers delineate boundaries of parliamentary oversight. However, this article demonstrates that strong formal powers are not necessary for parliaments in order to conduct oversight. If parliaments with weak formal powers had strong incentives to carry out oversight of the <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> Operation Atalanta, they did so by means of weakly-regulated forms of oversight. The article demonstrates that oversight beyond mandatory procedures coincides with domestic politicisation of Operation Atalanta (national framing). However, if European or international frames were dominant, parliaments {{were more likely to}} limit their oversight to mandatory procedures. Cases selected for the analysis, namely Germany, UK, France, Spain and Luxembourg, vary on the two explanatory factors (strength of formal powers and domestic politicisation of the Operation) ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to answer how and why France {{intervenes}} in Sub-Saharan Africa in the new millennium. This region represented the pivotal part of French colonial empire and France maintained close mutual relationship even after decolonization, {{partly due to the}} numerous military interventions. Security and defence policy towards Sub-Saharan Africa underwent gradual changes since the 1990 s', France started to participate in multilateral peace operations and outside its traditional sphere of influence. Since 2003, when the European Union launched the first operation on the African continent, the vast majority of French interventions took place within the Common Security and Defence Policy of the EU. There were twelve new operations in the examined period 2003 - 2012, from which four military missions were selected {{for the purpose of this}} research: Operation Artemis in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2003, EUFOR DR Congo ibidem in 2006, EUFOR Chad/CAR in Chad and Central African Republic from 2008 to 2009 and naval operation <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> Atalanta launched by the coast of Somalia in 2008.

Both NATO and <b>EU</b> <b>Navfor</b> denied involvement in the raid, as did a Turkish Foreign Ministry representative. A spokeswoman for the British Defence Ministry also said that she and her colleagues were not aware of any British involvement in the operation. According to another Somali intelligence official, the target of the raid was Al-Shabaab leader Ahmed Godane (Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr). A senior US military representative also indicated that Seal Team Six, the special force unit responsible for killing Osama bin Laden in Pakistan in 2011, launched the offensive but later abandoned the mission after coming under more fire than expected. Speaking about the aborted mission, US Secretary of State John Kerry said that the insurgents [...] "can run but they can't hide". A spokesman for the Pentagon likewise asserted that US soldiers had been involved in a counter-terrorism mission in Somalia against a known Al-Shabaab member, but did not elaborate. He also indicated that there were no US fatalities during the operation. US officials later confirmed that the target of the raid was Al-Shabaab commander Abdikadar Mohamed Abdikadar [...] "Ikrima".|$|R
40|$|The {{crisis in}} Somalia has caused {{appearance}} of piracy at sea in the Gulf of Aden and the Western Indian Ocean. Somali pirates {{have become a}} threat to economic security of the world because almost 30 percent of world oil and 20 percent of global trade passes through the Gulf of Aden. Solving the problem of piracy {{in this part of}} the world have included international organizations, institutions, military alliances and the states, acting in accordance with international law and UN Security Council resolutions. The European Union will demonstrate the application of a comprehensive approach to solving the problem of piracy at sea and the crisis in Somalia conducting naval operation — <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> Atalanta and operation EUTM under the Common Security and Defense Policy.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this master thesis is the European Union foreign and {{security}} policy. More detailed, {{what sort of}} foreign policy EU is implementing through its military operation <b>EU</b> <b>NAVFOR</b> Atalanta launched to prevent and combat piracy {{off the coast of}} Somalia, and which kind of power position it is seeking through it internationally. The theoretical framework creating the structure of the research comes from Hans Morgenthau and his realistic theory, which he introduced more in detail in his book called Politics Among Nations – The Struggle for Power and Peace (1948). In this book, he separates three different policy types based on the state’s foreign policy: policy of imperialism, policy of status quo and policy of prestige. The method of the research is directed content analysis. All the state’s actions, especially the ones that are considered to belong to the area of foreign politics, are somehow after power: they either seek to increase, stabilize or show off it. Consequently, the objective is to recognize wether EU is trying to acquire more power, hold on to its present power or mainly just demonstrating its power through Operation Atalanta. Furthermore, embarking upon the identification of the foreign policy type allows us to further see what kind of power distribution EU is seeking in relation to other security actors. By recognizing EU’s global ambitions and how it seeks to pursue them in the international security arena predictions can be made of EU’s future engagement beyond its borders in the field of foreign and security politics. The analysis shows that EU is implementing mainly policy of prestige in the context of Operation Atalanta; in the beginning policy of prestige contributing towards status quo and later policy of prestige to increase power. Its main purpose was to bring visibility and recognition to EU as a global security actor and increase its estimation of power internationally. Through acquiring more equal power distribution it was trying to place itself next to other big security actors and thus present itself as a credible and capable alternative security source. However, its fundamental objective was not to overthrow the present power balance completely but to make adjustments and shift the power structures towards more beneficial to its global actorness...|$|R
40|$|Maritime {{engagement}} in the Gulf of Aden is a puzzling case for anyone interested {{in the political and}} institutional problems underlying European Union–North Atlantic Treaty Organization (EU–NATO) cooperation. Although the <b>EU’s</b> operation <b>NAVFOR</b> ‘Atalanta’ and NATO’s ‘Ocean Shield’ operate in the same theatre and with similar mandates, there is no formal link between them. No joint planning has been envisaged, and no official task-sharing takes place. As this article aims to show, cooperation and coordination between EU and NATO forces at the operational and tactical levels have nevertheless worked surprisingly well. Two faces of EU–NATO cooperation become apparent: the political level is dominated by a permanent deadlock, while on the ground and at sea staff have developed a modus operandi that allows them to deliver fairly successfully in complementing yet detached operations. Based on 60 interviews with EU and NATO officials (2010 – 2013), this article illustrates how the operational and tactical levels have developed ways of coordinating efforts informally despite the lack of a formal framework. It aims to show to what extent and how they succeed at bypassing organizational boundaries and at overcoming political limitations. Although these practices are becoming increasingly institutionalized, {{it remains to be seen}} whether this will translate into formal changes...|$|R
