40|$|This study {{investigated}} the tribological and rheological properties of liquid and semi-solid food model systems containing micro-granular rice starch. Native (uncooked) and <b>gelatinized</b> rice <b>starch</b> dispersions, o/w emulsions and emulsion-filled gelatin gels were studied as food model systems. Native rice starch particles behaved as active fillers and increased the gel modulus with increasing concentration. At low concentration, soft <b>gelatinized</b> rice <b>starch</b> particles decreased gel modulus. At high concentration, <b>gelatinized</b> rice <b>starch</b> increased the gel modulus due to dense packing of particles. Native and <b>gelatinized</b> rice <b>starch</b> increased friction coefficients with increasing concentration due to different mechanisms. Native rice starch particles increase friction {{probably due to the}}ir irregular shape and particle agglomerations (at high concentration) that indirectly increase surface roughness and asperity contacts. <b>Gelatinized</b> rice <b>starch</b> particles increase friction probably due to the stickiness of leached-out starch polymers. The presence of oil droplets in rice starch-o/w emulsions could reduce the friction caused by stickiness of <b>gelatinized</b> rice <b>starch.</b> The tribological behaviors of rice starch-emulsion-filled gels are more complex than liquids due to the bulk and breakdown properties of the gel matrix. We conclude that morphology and surface properties of the rice starch particles together with bulk and breakdown properties of matrices are the main factors determining the tribological properties of food model systems containing rice starch particles...|$|R

50|$|Starch {{gelatinization}} occurs {{around the}} same time as when expansion stops and the cake sets or collapses. When starch granules are exposed to heat and water, they swell, leaching out some starch and forming hydrogen bonds with other starch granules. About 96% of the starch granules are <b>gelatinized.</b> <b>Starch</b> granules create very strong and rigid gel networks. The starch gel network is interspersed throughout the structure along with the aggregated protein network. The formation of the starch gel may interfere with expanding bubbles, causing them to burst and air to leave the cake. This would result in s collapsed cake.|$|E
50|$|Many various {{flavors of}} instant pudding are produced. Sugar, a {{flavoring}} agent and thickeners are primary ingredients. Instant chocolate pudding mix is manufactured using cocoa. A key ingredient in instant pudding is <b>gelatinized</b> <b>starch,</b> a gelatinized and dried instant starch that readily absorbs liquids, which causes the pudding to gel when mixed with milk. Additional ingredients sometimes {{used as a}} thickener include gums that are soluble in cold water, such as carrageenans and alginates.

30|$|The great {{tendency}} to hydrolyse <b>gelatinized</b> <b>starches</b> V 66 and V 69 was {{probably due to}} their higher water solubility {{in agreement with the}} data of Doué et al. (2013). The improvement of starch paste clarity is much appreciated by food and textile industries. So, the great hydrolysed starches, reported in this study such as V 66 and V 69 could serve as suitable materials in the above cited industries. For example, they can be used in pastry as fillings for cakes. Thus, it is obvious that these starch varieties have predispositions for other industries and in particular, desirable qualities which could make them widely used in food products preparation.|$|R
50|$|Simple {{carbohydrates}} are absorbed quickly, {{and therefore}} raise blood-sugar levels {{more rapidly than}} other nutrients.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{evaluated}} {{the effect of}} feed particle size, thermal processing different levels of fat inclusion and of moisture addition {{on the amount of}} <b>gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> in a corn-soybean broiler diet. The different processing factors were combined in a 2 x 4 x 4 x 2 factorial arrangement in a three randomized block design consisting of three production series: two particle sizes (coarse: 1041 microns and medium: 743 microns), four fat inclusion levels at the mixer (15, 25, 35, and 45 g/kg of feed), four moisture addition levels in the conditioner (0, 7, 14, and 21 g/kg of feed), and two thermal processing treatments (conditioning-pelleting or conditioning-expanding-pelleting) which resulted in 64 different processed feeds. For the determination of the amount of <b>gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> one feed sample was collected per treatment in each of three production series, totaling three replicates/treatment. Data were transformed using a variation of Box-Cox transformation in order to fit normal distribution (p> 0. 05). Adding moisture up to 21 g/kg of feed in the conditioner linearly increased the amount of <b>gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> (p< 0. 05). The conditioner-expander-pelleting treatment of the diets (at 110 °C) increased (p< 0. 05) the degree of starch gelatinization from 32. 0 to 35. 3 % compared with the conditioner-pelleting treatment (at 80 - 82 °C). The <b>gelatinized</b> <b>starch</b> content increased from 30. 2 to 37. 2 % in the feed (p< 0. 05) as the particle size increased from medium to coarse.

In particular cereal grains, mainly maize, constitute the 25. 6 % + 6. 7 (as fed) of TMR. The samples of maize grains were collected for about three months (N= 57) to perform chemical analysis: dry matter, crude protein, ether extract, ash, soluble polysaccharides (SC, by a-amylase treatment) and fibre fractions (a-NDF, ADF, ADL). The a-amylase treatment did not give values of fibrous fractions with a satisfying repeatability and there is not a good accord between SC (100 - indigested residue) and calculated non fibrous carbohydrates (NFC) values; presumably because it, alone, is not able to degrade crystalline starch (slowly digestible starch).
