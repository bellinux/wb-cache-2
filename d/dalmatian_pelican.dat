5|$|The {{legends of}} self-wounding and the {{provision}} of blood may have arisen because of the impression a pelican sometimes gives that it is stabbing itself with its bill. In reality, it often presses this onto its chest in order to fully empty the pouch. Another possible derivation is the tendency of the bird to rest with its bill on its breast; the <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelican</b> has a blood-red pouch in the early breeding season and this {{may have contributed to the}} myth.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelican</b> is {{the rarest}} species with a {{population}} estimated at between 10,000 and 20,000 following massive declines in the 19th and 20th centuries. The main ongoing threats include hunting, especially in eastern Asia, disturbance, coastal development, collision with overhead power lines and the over-exploitation of fish stocks. It is listed as Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species as the population trend is downwards, especially in Mongolia where it is nearly extinct. However, several colonies are increasing in size and the colony at the Small Prespa Lake in Greece has nearly 1000 breeding pairs.|$|E

25|$|Bulgaria's {{vertebrate}} fauna {{is among}} the most diverse in Europe. The zoogeograhical regions are three: the Eurosiberian region, encompassing the Danubian Plain and the mountainous regions of the country; the Irano-Turanian region encompassing Southern Dobrudzha; and the Mediterranean region that includes the Upper Thracian Plain, the lower Struma valley and the Black Sea coast. Bulgaria is inhabited by around 100 mammal species, including brown bears, grey wolves, Eurasian lynxes, golden jackals, red deer and roe deer among other. The avian fauna is represented by 426 species of birds, which is the second highest number in Europe. Important conservation species are the eastern imperial eagle, the cinereous vulture, the great white pelican, the <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelican,</b> etc. The reptiles and the amphibians found in Bulgaria are 38 and 20 species respectively. The ichtyofauna of the country has not been fully researched. As of 2000 there are 207 fish species. There are an estimated 27,000 species of insects and other invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|Animals {{exhibited}} at the zoo that are not housed {{in any of the}} main areas include bactrian camels, American flamingos, scarlet ibises, roseate spoonbills, <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans,</b> turkey vultures, Humboldt penguins, California sea lions, black-capped squirrel monkeys, chimpanzees and lions.|$|R
50|$|The zoo {{actively}} replenishes {{its collection}} and participates in international programs for cultivation {{and preservation of}} rare animal species. The zoo has enjoyed the offspring of snow leopards, zebras, Brazilian tapirs, and griffon vultures. Recently <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans,</b> Bennett's tree-kangaroos, white-naped cranes and lions have been delivered.|$|R
50|$|Among {{a highly}} social family in general, <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans</b> {{may have the}} least social inclinations. This species {{naturally}} nests in relatively small groups compared to most other pelican species and sometimes may even nest alone. However, small colonies are usually formed, which regularly include upwards of 250 pairs (especially historically). Occasionally, <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans</b> may mix in with colonies of great white pelicans. Nesting sites selected are usually either islands in large bodies of water (typically lagoons or river deltas) or dense mats of aquatic vegetation, such as extensive reedbeds of Phragmites and Typha. Due to their large size, these pelicans often trample the vegetation in the area surrounding their nests into the muddy substrate and thus nesting sites may become unsuitably muddy after around three years of usage.|$|R

50|$|The Atanasovo Lake {{is one of}} two salt-water {{lakes in}} the Black Sea region and {{contains}} rare and representative examples of wetland habitats. It is a hot spot for biodiversity, with many Red-Listed species of plants and animals. It is a well-known bottleneck site for migratory birds, with around 60,000 raptors and 240,000 storks, pelicans and cranes passing over the site and often landing in large numbers for staging. The highest numbers in Europe of migrating White <b>Pelicans</b> (Pelecanus onocrotalus), <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>Pelicans</b> (Pelecanus crispus), Marsh Harriers (Circus aeruginosus) and Red-footed Falcons (Falco vespertinus) have been recorded here.|$|R
50|$|This pelican usually migrates short distances. It is {{dispersive}} in Europe, {{based on}} feeding opportunities, with most western birds staying {{through the winter}} in the Mediterranean region. In the Danube Delta, <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans</b> arrive in March and leave {{by the end of}} August. It is more actively migratory in Asia, where most of the birds that breed in Russia fly down for the winter to the central Middle East, largely around Iran through to the Indian Subcontinent, from Sri Lanka, Nepal to central India. The pelicans that breed in Mongolia winter along the east coast of China, including the Hong Kong area.|$|R
50|$|There are {{a number}} of {{protected}} wetlands (under Ramsar Convention) in Pakistan. These include Tanda dam and Thanedar Wala in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Chashma barrage, Taunsa barrage and Uchhali complex in Punjab, Haleji lake, Hub dam and Kinjhar lake in Sindh, Miani Hor in Balochistan. The wetlands are a habitat for migratory birds such as <b>dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans</b> and demoiselle crane as well as predatory species of osprey, common kingfisher, fishing cat and leopard cat near the coast line. Chashma and Taunsa Barrage Dolphin Sanctuary protects the threatened species of Indus river dolphins which tend to live in freshwater.|$|R

5|$|Along the {{southern}} {{shores of the}} peninsula, and within the river delta, exist a range of bird and marine life. Many of these species are endangered, {{which was one of}} the primary factors considered when placing the delta under national protection. Some of the more common bird species observed here include pygmy cormorants (Microcarbo pygmeus), little egrets (Egretta garzetta), lesser kestrels (Falco naumanni), Kentish plovers (Charadrius alexandrinus), white-tailed eagles (Haliaeetus albicilla), and the <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans</b> (Pelecanus crispus), for which the park is a key nesting place. Marine life consists of species typical of the Aegean Sea, as well as some species usually found elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|The site is an {{important}} habitat for waterbirds and supports around 60 to 100 thousand migratory birds annually. According to a 1997 census by the Zoological Survey Department of Pakistan, around 40 to 50 thousand American flamingos and Paradisaea minor (lesser birds-of-paradise) were recorded in the region. The lagoon {{is also home to}} around six thousand <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans,</b> which are listed as vulnerable by IUCN. This is the largest concentration of these birds found in Pakistan. In the high-lying areas around the lagoon, Tamarix and other salt-tolerant bushes can be found. Low-lying areas, which receive fresh water inputs from outfall drains, are covered with Typha plants. Aside from this, due to shallow lagoons, very little vegetation is present in the area.|$|R
40|$|Data on number {{increase}} of the Cormorant and change of its status in Donetsk region at the Sea of Azov coast are presented for the last 6 years. Firstly the Cormorant was rare on passage and common but non-breeding in summer, later it becomes numerous and breeding species. On Krivaya Spit in the Sea of Azov region there were 154 breeding pairs in 2007 and 1800 breeding pairs - already in 2008. Interactions between the Cormorant and the Great Black-headed Gull are considered. The accumulative role of the Cormorant in attraction of the White and <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>Pelicans</b> is noted. Positive influence of strengthening of a protection regime on the increase in numbers of nesting birds on the Krivaya Spit due to foundation of the Regional Landscape Park "Meotida" is discussed...|$|R

50|$|Despite {{occupying a}} {{relatively}} small area, 265 bird species have been observed in the protected area Poda. 46 bird species nest {{in the area and}} it is the only location on the Black Sea Coast with a mixed heron breeding colony of spoonbill, glossy ibis, purple heron, grey heron, night heron, great white egret and little egret. Other species breeding in the area are marsh harriers, common terns and little terns, and great cormorants - which have forsaken their usual breeding sites in reed beds and made their nests in the abandoned electrical pylons in the area. Its rich biodiversity is attributed to the three different types of water habitats it contains - brackish, fresh, and hyper-saline salt water. During the winter months in the bay at Poda, pygmy cormorants, a globally endangered species, rest at Poda. Other endangered species in the area at this time are <b>Dalmatian</b> <b>pelicans</b> and white-headed ducks. They share the bay with thousands of coots, pochards, and other ducks. Poda is located along Europe's second largest bird migration route, the Via Pontica. Annually, 75% of the European white stork population (over 250,000), 100% of the white pelican population (over 40,000) and thousands of raptors, waterfowl and song birds can be observed during the months of migration in March-April and August-September.|$|R
