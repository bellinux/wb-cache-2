5|$|After <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> The Wooden Horse, in 1909, Walpole wrote prolifically, {{producing}} {{at least}} one book every year. He was a spontaneous story-teller, writing quickly to get all his ideas on paper, seldom revising. <b>His</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel</b> to achieve major success was his third, Mr Perrin and Mr Traill, a tragicomic story of a fatal clash between two schoolmasters. During the First World War {{he served in the}} Red Cross on the Russian-Austrian front, and worked in British propaganda in Petrograd and London. In the 1920s and 1930s Walpole was much in demand not only as a novelist but also as a lecturer on literature, making four exceptionally well-paid tours of North America.|$|E
5|$|Acton's severe {{judgement}} did {{not deter}} Waugh from {{his intention to}} be a writer, but it affected his belief that he could succeed as a novelist. For a time {{he turned his attention}} away from fiction, but with the gradual recovery of his self-confidence he was able to complete <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> Decline and Fall, which was published with great success in 1928.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> Taikor, was {{released}} in late 2004. It is a historical saga of Malaya which traces the years 1922 to 1982, {{telling the story of}} Ya Loong, from his family's migration from South Thailand to Penang after his father's death.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intense single character focus of <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> ¡Ecue-Yamba-O! (Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World. There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds to the key blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Allen Lethem (LEE-thum, born February 19, 1964) is an American novelist, essayist, {{and short}} story writer. <b>His</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> Gun, with Occasional Music, a genre work that mixed {{elements}} {{of science fiction}} and detective fiction, was published in 1994.

50|$|Born in Paris, Brussolo had a tormented childhood. He studied {{letters and}} {{psychology}} and wrote <b>his</b> <b>first</b> texts very early, finding inspiration in his misery and disturbed family environment.

50|$|After {{publishing}} <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>novels</b> in Creole {{and suffering}} very poor sales, Confiant took another approach in 1988 by publishing <b>his</b> <b>first</b> French-language <b>novel,</b> Le Nègre et l'Amiral, set in Martinique during World War II. The novel was welcomed by the French literary crowd {{as a new}} voice in French-language literature. Narrowly missing the Goncourt Prize in 1991 with his second French novel, Eau de Café, Confiant has ever since continued writing in French, even translating <b>his</b> <b>first</b> Creole-language <b>novels.</b> The themes of his last novels seem to be dictated by the anniversaries of French West Indian events like the 1902 Mount Pelée eruption (with Nuée Ardente, published in 2002) or the 1854 arrival of East-Indian indentured servants (La Panse du Chacal, 2004).|$|R
5|$|Keable's {{most famous}} {{publication}} was <b>his</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> Simon Called Peter, but {{he produced a}} prodigious literary output, spanning theological tracts through poetry to travel guides. Simon Called Peters sequel, Recompense, {{was made into a}} film, and his later novels all attracted substantial attention. His writings generally met with much greater popular than critical approbation, and Simon Called Peter was sufficiently incendiary to be banned. The book nonetheless became a contemporary best-seller.|$|E

5|$|Baker {{was also}} the {{inspiration}} for literary works. In 1913 F. Scott Fitzgerald enrolled at Princeton as a freshman, when Baker was a senior. Though he only spoke to Baker once during their time at Princeton, Fitzgerald idolized him. <b>His</b> <b>first</b> <b>novel,</b> This Side of Paradise, has several references to Baker: the main character is named Amory Blaine after Baker's middle name, and the minor character Allenby is Baker himself. Mark Goodman's 1985 novel Hurrah for the Next Man Who Dies is a fictionalized account of Baker's life.|$|E

In doing so they followed the same train route Fleming had taken with his friend Ivar Bryce in July 1943, when Fleming had first visited the island.|$|E
