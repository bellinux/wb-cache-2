5000|$|Three chief {{presentations of}} <b>dyssynchrony</b> can occur. Atrioventricular (AV) <b>dyssynchrony</b> occurs {{when there is}} an {{unfavorable}} difference in timing between atrial and ventricular contractions. Interventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> occurs when there is a difference in timing between right ventricular (RV) and left ventricular (LV) Systole. Intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> occurs when the timing in a sequence of activations and contractions of segments of the LV wall becomes abnormal. In all three types, changes in timing lead to changes in the dynamic behavior of the myocardial tissues, leading to mechanical <b>dyssynchrony.</b> [...] All three presentations allow distinct and easily reproducible electrical signatures as illustrated by left and right bundle branch blocks, hemiblocks, etc. The concise measurement of the time and morphology of the QRS interval allows the interventional ability to manipulate this interval with biventricular pacemakers. It is important to distinguish ventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> from ventricular dyssynergy. Dyssynergy refers to changes in relative strength of contractions, whereas <b>dyssynchrony</b> is a change in relative timing of contractions. Once again the terms inotropy and chronotropy apply to the pathology under examination. Biventricular pacing strongly favors chronotropy over inotropy.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesThe {{purpose of}} this study was to compare left {{ventricular}} (LV) <b>dyssynchrony</b> assessment by gated myocardial perfusion single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) (GMPS) and tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). BackgroundRecently, it has been suggested that LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> is an important predictor of response to cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT); <b>dyssynchrony</b> is predominantly assessed by TDI with echocardiography. Information on LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> can also be provided by GMPS with phase analysis of regional LV maximal count changes throughout the cardiac cycle, which tracks the onset of LV thickening. MethodsIn 75 patients with heart failure, depressed LV function, and wide QRS complex, GMPS and 2 -dimensional echocardiography, including TDI, were performed as part of clinical screening for eligibility for CRT. Clinical status was evaluated with New York Heart Association functional classification, 6 -min walk distance, and quality-of-life score. Different parameters (histogram bandwidth, phase SD, histogram skewness, and histogram kurtosis) of LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> were assessed from GMPS and compared with LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> on TDI with Pearson’s correlation analyses. ResultsHistogram bandwidth and phase SD correlated well with LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> assessed with TDI (r = 0. 89, p < 0. 0001 and r = 0. 80, p < 0. 0001, respectively).

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: Cardiac {{resynchronization}} therapy (CRT) is {{an important}} therapeutic approach for patients with symptomatic heart failure. The assessment of mechanical <b>dyssynchrony,</b> however, remains an issue. Little data are available regarding {{the influence of the}} right ventricle (RV) on left ventricle (LV) mechanical <b>dyssynchrony</b> as assessed by echocardiography. AIMS: We sought {{to assess the impact of}} RV contractility on LV function and <b>dyssynchrony.</b> METHODS: A total of 40 patients with congestive heart failure were analyzed. Twenty had RV dysfunction, as defined by a tricuspid annular systolic peak of tissue Doppler (SaRV) 11. 5 cm/s. All patients underwent echocardiography in order to determine RV function, LV function, and <b>dyssynchrony.</b> RESULTS: The two populations were similar regarding diastolic function, atrio-ventricular conduction and interventricular <b>dyssynchrony.</b> Patients with RV dysfunction showed significantly more severe LV longitudinal <b>dyssynchrony</b> (130 ± 103 ms vs. 62 ± 59 ms; p= 0. 01). In addition, SaRV (systolic peak recorded at the tricuspid annulus) was correlated with LV longitudinal <b>dyssynchrony</b> (r= 0. 47; p= 0. 001). In contrast, LV radial contractility and <b>dyssynchrony</b> (103 ± 110 ms vs. 100 ± 78 ms; p= 0. 5) were not affected by RV function.

MethodsA total of 103 patients with IDC were studied. Left bundle branch block was present in 25 % of patients. Equilibrium radionuclide angiography was performed and Fourier phase analyses were examined in both ventricles. Difference between the mean phase of left ventricle (LV) and right ventricle (RV) assessed interventricular <b>dyssynchrony,</b> and standard deviations (SDs) of the mean phase in each ventricle assessed intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony.</b> ResultsThe QRS duration was related to both interventricular and intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony.</b> A degradation of the hemodynamic status was associated {{with an increase in}} intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> but not in interventricular <b>dyssynchrony.</b> With a follow-up of 27 ± 23 months, 18 patients had a major cardiac event (7 cardiac deaths; 11 worsening, leading to heart transplantation). The SDs of the LV and RV mean phase and QRS duration were predictors of cardiac event (all p < 0. 0001), but interventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> was not. Among 13 univariate predictors of cardiac event, the only independent predictors were an increased SD of LV mean phase (p = 0. 0004) and an increased pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (p = 0. 009).

40|$|Triplane tissue {{synchronization}} imaging (TSI) and real-time 3 -dimensional echocardiography (RT 3 DE) provide different {{characterizations of}} left ventricular (LV) mechanics and <b>dyssynchrony.</b> Triplane TSI assesses differences {{in time to}} peak systolic segmental myocardial tissue velocities, whereas RT 3 DE evaluates differences in time to minimum end-systolic regional volumes. Whether an approach using the 2 3 D techniques predicts better significant reverse remodeling after cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) remains unknown. In 166 patients (mean age 66 +/- 9 years, 78 % men) treated with CRT, baseline LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> was assessed using RT 3 DE and triplane TSI. LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> was defined by a systolic <b>dyssynchrony</b> index >/= 6. 4 % when assessed with RT 3 DE and SD of time to peak velocity of 12 segments (Ts-SD- 12) >/= 33 ms with triplane TSI. CRT response was defined by >/= 15 % decrease in LV end-systolic volume at 6 -month follow-up. Mean LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> using Ts-SD- 12 was 48 +/- 26 ms and mean systolic <b>dyssynchrony</b> index was 8. 51 +/- 3. 81 %. Response to CRT was observed in 86. 3 % of patients showing LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> with the 2 methods. In contrast, 97 % of patients who did not show significant LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> {{with any of the}} techniques were nonresponders (p < 0. 001). Importantly, systolic <b>dyssynchrony</b> index and LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> using Ts-SD- 12 were independent predictors of response to CRT (p < 0. 001 for each technique). Assessment of LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> with the 2 techniques showed incremental value for prediction of significant LV reverse remodeling over its assessment with only 1 technique (chi-square 90. 18, p < 0. 001).

Patients with less advanced cardiac disease often exhibit intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony,</b> {{but there is little}} available information about its prognostic relevance in such patients. We investigated the prognostic effect of intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> on outcome in 318 patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease who were classified according to {{the presence or absence of}} left ventricular dysfunction and heart failure symptoms. Mortality was considered the primary end point over a median follow-up of 56 months, and a Cox proportional hazards model was used for survival analysis. Despite a low prevalence (8 %) of left bundle branch block, there was a high prevalence of intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> even in patients without symptomatic heart failure. The magnitude of intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> correlated poorly with QRS duration (r = 0. 25),end-systolic volume index (r = 0. 27), and number of scar segments (r = 0. 25). There,were 58 deaths during follow-up. Ventricular volume, ischemic burden, and magnitude of intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> predicted outcome, but magnitude of intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> was an independent predictor of survival only in patients with asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. In conclusion, patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease have a high prevalence of intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony.</b> Although ventricular volume, ischemic burden, and intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> are potentially important prognostic markers, the relative importance of intraventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> changes with the clinical setting and, may be greatest-in patients with preclinical disease.

BackgroundAsynchronous myocardial contraction adversely influences ventricular function and {{is associated with a}} poor prognosis in heart failure.

MethodsA total of 65 consecutive heart failure patients and 50 matched healthy control patients underwent exercise echocardiography. Conventional and tissue Doppler parameters were measured before and during symptom-limited exercise. Left ventricular <b>dyssynchrony</b> was defined as the standard deviation of 12 LV segmental electromechanical delays. Analysis of the control group allowed delimitation of normal cutoff values. ResultsIn patients with normal left ventricular function, exercise did not modify the extent of LV asynchrony. In contrast, in heart failure patients, LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> increased by at least 20 % in 34 %, remained stable in 37 %, and decreased by at least 20 % in 29 %. Moreover, 26 % of heart failure patients had either exercise induction or normalization of ventricular <b>dyssynchrony.</b> A significant association was found between exercise-induced changes in <b>dyssynchrony</b> and the presence of ischemic cardiomyopathy (p < 0. 05).

BackgroundMechanical LV <b>dyssynchrony</b> is associated with response to CRT; however, complex patterns may exist. MethodsWe studied 190 heart failure patients (ejection fraction [EF] 23 ± 6 %, QRS duration 168 ± 27 ms) before and after CRT.

ResultsOne hundred seventy-six patients (93 %) had technically sufficient baseline and follow-up data available. Overall, 34 % were EF nonresponders at 6 ± 3 months after CRT. When both longitudinal <b>dyssynchrony</b> by 2 -site TDI (≥ 60 ms) and radial <b>dyssynchrony</b> (≥ 130 ms) were positive, 95 % of patients had an EF response; when both were negative, 21 % had an EF response (p < 0. 001 vs. both positive). The EF response rate was lowest (10 %) when <b>dyssynchrony</b> was negative using 12 -site TDI and radial strain (p < 0. 001 vs. both positive). When either longitudinal or radial <b>dyssynchrony</b> was positive (but not both), 59 % had an EF response. Combined longitudinal and radial <b>dyssynchrony</b> predicted EF response with 88 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity, which was significantly better than either technique alone (p < 0. 0001). ConclusionsCombined patterns of longitudinal and radial <b>dyssynchrony</b> can be predictive of LV functional response after CRT...|$|E
