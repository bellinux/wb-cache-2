40|$|Magnetic {{properties}} of cast amorphous and nanocrystalline microwires have been reviewed considering their potential application. Microwires were produced from Co Fe Mn Cr Cu B and Si using the Taylor–Ulitovsky method. Technological {{aspects of the}} Taylor–Ulitovsky method for fabrication of glass-coated microwire with different structure are analyzed. Magnetic microwires demonstrate a large variety of magnetic behaviors, which is important for sensing applications. Depending on the chemical composition of the metallic core, for Co-, Fe- and Ni-based composition, the microwires’ properties are very different. The geometrical characteristics (diameter of metallic core and thickness of the glass) of the microwire depend on the physical {{properties of}} a metallic composition and of glass and {{the parameters of the}} <b>heating</b> <b>inductor</b> and the speed of obtaining a microwire. The diameter of metallic core in these microwires can range from 0. 5 to 70 μm, and their thickness of the glass can vary from 1 to 50 μm...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThermometry at the {{nanoscale}} is {{an emerging}} area fostered by intensive research on nanoparticles (NPs) that {{are capable of}} converting electromagnetic waves into heat. Recent results suggest that stationary gradients can be maintained between the surface of NPs and the bulk solvent, a phenomenon sometimes referred to as ` cold hyperthermia'. However, the measurement of such highly localized temperatures is particularly challenging. We describe here a new approach to probing the temperature at the surface of iron oxide NPs and enhancing the understanding of this phenomenon. This approach involves the grafting of thermosensitive polymer chains to the NP surface followed by the measurement of macroscopic properties of the resulting NP suspension and comparison to a calibration curve built up by macroscopic heating. Superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs were prepared by the coprecipitation of ferrous and ferric salts and functionalized with amines, then azides using a sol-gel route followed by a dehydrative coupling reaction. Thermosensitive poly[2 -(dimethylamino) ethyl methacrylate] (PDMAEMA) with an alkyne end-group was synthesized by controlled radical polymerization and was grafted using a copper assisted azide-alkyne cycloaddition reaction. Measurement of the colloidal properties by dynamic light scattering (DLS) indicated that the thermosensitive NPs exhibited changes in their Zeta potential and hydrodynamic diameter as a function of pH and temperature due to the grafted PDMAEMA chains. These changes were accompanied by changes in the relaxivities of the NPs, suggesting application as thermosensitive contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In addition, a new fibre-based backscattering setup enabled positioning of the DLS remote-head {{as close as possible to}} the coil of a magnetic <b>heating</b> <b>inductor</b> to afford in situ probing of the backscattered light intensity, hydrodynamic diameter, and temperature. This approach provides a promising platform for estimating the response of magnetic NPs to application of a radiofrequency magnetic field or for understanding the behaviour of other thermogenic NPs...|$|E
40|$|Induction heating is {{a heating}} method for {{electrically}} conductive materials that {{takes advantage of}} the heat generated by the Eddy currents originated by means of a varying magnetic field. Since Michael Faraday discovered electromagnetic induction in 1831, this phenomena has been widely studied in many applications like transformers, motors or generators' design. At the turn of the 20 th century, induction started to be studied as a heating method, leading to the construction of the first industrial induction melting equipment by the Electric Furnace Company in 1927. At first, the varying magnetic fields were obtained with spark-gap generators, vacuum-tube generators and low frequency motor-generator sets. With the emergence of reliable semiconductors in the late 1960 's, motor-generators were replaced by solid-state converters for low frequency applications. With regard to the characterization of the inductor-workpiece system, the first models used to understand the load's behavior were based on analytical methods. These methods were useful to analyze the overall behavior of the load, but they were not accurate enough for a precise analysis and were limited to simple geometries. With the emergence of computers, numerical methods experienced a tremendous growth in the 1990 's and started to be applied in the induction heating field. Nowadays, the development of commercial softwares that allow this type of analysis have started to make the use of numerical methods popular among research centers and enterprises. This type of softwares allow a great variety of complex analysis with high precision, consequently diminishing the trial and error process. The research realized in last decades, the increase in the utilization of numerical modeling and the appearance and improvement of semiconductor devices, with their corresponding cost reduction, have caused the spread of induction heating in many fields. Induction heating equipments can be found in many applications, since domestic cookers to high-power aluminum melting furnaces or automotive sealing equipments, and {{are becoming more and more}} popular thanks to their easy control, quick heating and the energy savings obtained. The present thesis focuses on the application of induction heating to wire heating. The wire heating is a continuous heating method in which the wire is continuously feeding the <b>heating</b> <b>inductor.</b> This heating method allows high production rates with reduced space requirements and is usually found in medium to high power industrial processes working 24 hours per day. The first chapters of this study introduce the induction heating phenomena, its modeling and the converters and tanks used. Afterwards, a multichannel converter for high-power and high-frequency applications is designed and implemented with the aim of providing modularity to the converter and reduce the designing time, the production cost and its maintenance. Moreover, this type of structure provides reliability to the system and enables low repairing times, which is an extremely interesting feature for 24 hours processes. Additionally, a software phase-locked loop for induction heating applications is designed and implemented to prove its flexibility and reliability. This type of control allows the use of the same hardware for different applications, which is attractive for the case of industrial applications. This phase-locked loop is afterwards used to design and implement a load-adaptative control that varies the references to have soft-switching according to load's variation, improving converter's performance. Finally, the modeling of a continuous induction wire hardening system is realized, solving the difficulty of considering the mutual influence between the thermal, electromagnetic and electric parameters. In this thesis, a continuous process is modeled and tested using numerical methods and considering converter's operation and influence in the process. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|In a Fermilab-Los Alamos collaboration, inductances {{constructed}} of ferrite cores sufficient to cancel a large {{fraction of the}} space charge potential-well distortion were installed in the Los Alamos Proton Storage Ring (PSR) as one means of raising the threshold for the two-stream e-p instability. When operating at higher intensities and with sufficient inductance added for full space-charge compensation, an unacceptable longitudinal self-bunching, microwave-like, instability was encountered. Heating the cores to {approximately} 130 C {{proved to be an}} effective cure, and was found to be a means for tuning the inductance over a limited but useful range.

40|$|International audienceLong {{induction}} heating lines {{are widely used}} in metallurgical, forging and tube industries. Big length and large number of inductors in one line, make optimal design of these systems rather complicated especially when the <b>heating</b> <b>inductors</b> are connected in series and parallel groups supplied from different power sources. Typically solid or tubular products with square or round cross-sections are being heated in lines. In some installations individual inductors or groups of inductors are supplied from the sources with different frequencies. This presentation is devoted to design of such systems using program ELTA 6. 0. ELTA is a program based on 1 D Finite Difference Method (FDM) with semi-analytical account for the lengths of individual inductors and loads. Version 6. 0 has an important 2 D option for heating of bodies with rectangular cross-sections in the longitudinal magnetic field. All FDM calculations are related to a certain cross-section of the load, which passes through the processing steps in function of time. This algorithm allows the user to simulate multi-step heating processes in one “shot” and is very convenient for simulation of the induction lines with any number of stages describing <b>heating</b> in individual <b>inductors,</b> cooling in the gaps between them and even heating or holding in a flame or electric furnace. Description of the computer assisted design of induction lines is illustrated by several examples. Due to very fast simulation {{it is easy to}} optimize the process of heating, i. e. to find an optimal variation of frequency and specific power versus time and therefore along the heating line...|$|R
40|$|In laser {{cladding}} thermal contraction of the initially liquid coating during cooling causes residual stresses and possibly cracks. Preweld or postweld <b>heating</b> using <b>inductors</b> {{can reduce the}} thermal strain difference between coating and substrate and thus reduce the resulting stress. The aim of this work is {{to better understand the}} influence of various thermometallurgical and mechanical phenomena on stress evolution and to optimize the induction-assisted {{laser cladding}} process to get crack-free coatings of hard materials at high feed rates. First, an analytical one-dimensional model is used to visualize the most important features of stress evolution for a Stellite coating on a steel substrate. For more accurate studies, laser cladding is simulated including the powder-beam interaction, the powder catchment by the melt pool, and the self-consistent calculation of temperature field and bead shape. A three-dimensional finite element model and the required equivalent heat sources are derived from the results and used for the transient thermomechanical analysis, taking into account phase transformations and the elastic-plastic material behavior with strain hardening.

40|$|Cracking in laser {{cladding}} caused by inhomogeneous thermal expansion and/or phase transformations restricts the feasible feed {{rates and the}} use of high-strength coating materials. In order to better understand the physical reasons of thermal stress and cracking and to reduce the restrictions mentioned, the formation of beads and the evolution of the temperature and stress fields in {{laser cladding}} are simulated with and without inductive pre- or post-weld heating. The results of a semi-analytical analysis of the cladding process are transferred to a finite element model which calculates the temperature field, the phase transformations, and the residual stress and strain. These results show that both the danger of cracking due to high residual stress and strain and the distortion of the workpiece by irreversible plastic and thermo-metallurgical strain may be reduced by pre- or post-weld <b>heating</b> using <b>inductors</b> which can be directly integrated into the cladding process...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Induction {{heating process}} {{is often used}} as {{the first stage of}} {{quenching}} process. Computer simulation of the induction heating make it possible to eliminate expensive and time-consuming experimental selection of parameters. The selection of appropriate heating parameters is particularly difficult for the irregularly shaped parts. Gears are an example of such elements. In the case of surface quenching / heating a uniform distribution of temperature field is necessary on the surface and expected temperature gradient inside the heated gear. The following parameters: inductor frequency, <b>inductor</b> power, <b>heating</b> time, <b>inductor</b> geometry, distance between <b>inductor</b> and <b>heating</b> gear and relative shift between inductor and gear {{have a significant effect on}} the temperature distribution. Obtaining the correct temperature distribution requires proper selection of the above mentioned parameters. Numerical optimization or multi-variant calculations are the best way to achieve the goal. Design/methodology/approach: This work presents numerical simulation of induction heating. Such simulation consists of an analysis of coupled electromagnetic and thermal fields. Commercial program Flux 3 D, was used to perform the calculations. Findings: Execution of 10 variants of calculation enables to obtain the optimal values of the parameters influencing the heating process. Practical implications: During the test quenching of the gear a problem of non uniform temperature distribution appears. The attempts of experimental selection of heating parameters failed, and the problem was solved by multi-variant calculations. The results obtained from the calculations were successfully applied in the quenching process. Originality/value: This paper shows an application of numerical simulation in gear quenching. The results of simulations were practically verified...|$|R
40|$|Inductors are {{frequently}} used in railway electrical tractions systems in filtering and current limiting operations. Magnetic fields are generated {{due to the}} flow of large AC currents through the coils, which intend induce currents on the coils {{as well as the}} metallic components in the vicinity, causing electromagnetic heating. The heating may cause temperatures to exceed project temperature requirements and in the worst case distort the functionality of drive system. The purpose of this work is to simulate the Electromagnetic <b>Heating</b> effect of <b>inductors</b> in 3 D using COMSOL Multiphysics. First a 3 D CAD model of the inductor geometry is imported to COMSOL and the magnetic fields for a giving current excitation are estimated. Then the power losses are fed in to a heat flow simulation to predict the temperature distributions. Cooling is simulated by driving cool air through the heated coils and the surrounding metal objects. The temperature distributions for different current excitations and air flow velocities are estimated. Simulation is performed on conceptual project inductor model.

40|$|Purpose: Numerical {{modelling}} of {{induction heating}} {{process is a}} complex issue. It needs analysis of coupled electromagnetic and thermal fields. Calculation models for electromagnetic field analysis as well as thermal field analysis need simplifications. In case of thermal field calculations, correct modelling of radiative heat exchange between the <b>heated</b> charge and <b>inductor’s</b> thermal insulation is essential. Most commercial calculation programs enabling coupled analysis of electromagnetic and thermal fields do not allow taking into consideration radiative heat exchange between calculation model components, which limits thermal calculations only to the charge area. The paper presents a supplementation of the program Flux 2 D with radiative heat exchange procedures. Design/methodology/approach: Commercial program Flux 2 D designed for coupled electromagnetic and thermal calculation (based on finite element method) was supplemented with authors program for radiative heat exchange based on numerical integration of classic equations. Findings: Supplementation EM-T calculations with radiative heat exchange between charge and inductor enables to calculate thermal insulation parameters and increase precision of modelling. Research limitations/implications: Procedures for radiative heat exchange enables calculation of two surfaces (flat or cylindrical) with finite dimensions. The surfaces can be displaced relative to each other (charge shorter or longer than thermal insulation of inductor). Material of surfaces is modelled as: flat, diffuse, radiant surfaces absorb energy evenly in the whole spectrum (grey bodies). The whole system is modelled as in a steady thermal state (quasi-steady). Originality/value: Authors program extends Flux 2 D features with a possibility for calculating radiative heat transfer. The application of radiative process is possible between all components of the studied model, {{not only for the}} boundary conditions...|$|R
