40|$|LINKER was {{developed}} as an online server to assist biomedical researchers to design linker sequences for constructing functional fusion proteins. The program automatically generates {{a set of}} peptide sequences that are known to adopt extended conformations as determined by X-ray crystallography and NMR. In addition to the desired linker sequence length, the web interface provides a number of optional input parameters so that the users may enhance sequence selection based on the requirements of specific applications. The output of LINKER includes a list of peptide sequences with specified length and sequence characteristics. A <b>graphical</b> <b>subroutine</b> was implemented to highlight the chemical features of every linker sequence by hydrophobicity plots. LINKER can be accessed at [URL]...|$|E
40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{complexities}} of conventional programming, graphical software {{was used in the}} development of instrumentation drivers. The graphical software provides a standard set of tools (<b>graphical</b> <b>subroutines)</b> which are sufficient to program the most sophisticated CAMAC/GPIB drivers. These tools were used and instrumentation drivers were successfully developed for operating CAMAC/GPIB hardware from two different manufacturers: LeCroy and DSP. The use of these tools is presented for programming a LeCroy A/D Waveform Analyzer...|$|R
40|$|SLIDES is {{a program}} which takes text and {{commands}} as input and prepares lettered slides and posters. When run on the time-sharing computer, the program can display its output on an interactive graphics terminal; in batch, it can direct its graphical output {{to a variety of}} plotters. The program uses DISSPLA <b>graphical</b> <b>subroutines</b> and standard ANL plotter subroutines. This report contains material written for the novice computer user, who should be able to produce useful slides or posters by following the examples. This report also serves as a complete reference for the SLIDES program...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of geometrical schemes to large sphere antenna reflectors was investigated. The {{purpose of these}} studies {{is to determine the}} shape and size of flat segmented surfaces which approximate general shells of revolution and in particular spherical and paraboloidal reflective surfaces. The extensive mathematical and computational geometry analyses of the reflector resulted {{in the development of a}} general purpose computer program. This program is capable of generating the complete design parameters of the dish and can meet stringent accuracy requirements. The computer program also includes a <b>graphical</b> self contained <b>subroutine</b> which graphically displays the required design...|$|R
