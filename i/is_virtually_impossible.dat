5|$|Some anti-bathhouse activists {{argue that}} these {{measures}} are not enough, especially given that it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to monitor sexual activity in a bathhouse; however, while they acknowledge that closing gay bathhouses may force some men into unsafe or illegal situations in public parks and lavatories, {{they point out that}} they may be less likely to engage in anal or multipartner sexboth of which put participants at risk for contracting STDsin such situations.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, feminist critics {{opened up}} new {{approaches}} to Gertrude and Ophelia. New Historicist and cultural materialist critics examined the play in its historical context, attempting to piece together its original cultural environment. They focused on the gender system of early modern England, pointing to the common trinity of maid, wife, or widow, with whores outside of that stereotype. In this analysis, the essence of Hamlet is the central character's changed perception of his mother as a whore because of her failure to remain faithful to Old Hamlet. In consequence, Hamlet loses his faith in all women, treating Ophelia as if she too were a whore and dishonest with Hamlet. Ophelia, by some critics, {{can be seen as}} honest and fair; however, it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to link these two traits, since 'fairness' is an outward trait, while 'honesty' is an inward trait.|$|E

5|$|To {{achieve that}} result, Varrick takes care {{to prevent the}} case from going to Florida, Alisandros' {{favorite}} battleground. It is much better for them to let jurisdiction be claimed by Chicago federal judge Harry Seawright, with whom Rogan Rothberg has some ties. A bonus from Varrick's {{point of view is}} the fact that the Chicago tort lawsuit was filed by such a minor and inexperienced firm as Finley & Figg; it is confidently assumed that Karros would make short work of them in court. The case is soon expedited on Seawright's docket with Finley & Figg's claim singled out of the tort claimants and Karros takes action to have Finley & Figg's eight death cases heard separately. The specific case singled out to serve as the test case is one in which Finley & Figg represents the widow of a man who died after taking Krayoxx but he was also taking prior to his death a mixture of some ten other drugs, so that it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to pinpoint the effect of Krayoxx.|$|E
25|$|For hard (Ixodid) ticks it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> for {{mechanical}} transmission to occur {{on its own}} (i.e. without some replication), as they tend to not take multiple blood meals from different hosts in the one stage.

25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> {{to train}} {{a child for}} a WISC test or other gifted test.

25|$|Since a clear {{archetype}} {{for determining}} guilt does not exist, {{the criminal justice}} system must rely on rulings handed down by juries. Even after a decision has been made, it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to know whether a jury has been correct or incorrect in freeing or accusing a defendant of a crime. Although establishing the effectiveness of juries is an arduous task, contemporary research has provided partial support for the proficiency of juries as decision makers.|$|E
25|$|The {{end of the}} ED is {{not defined}} archaeologically, but {{political}}ly. The conquests of Sargon and his successors upset the political equilibrium throughout Iraq, Syria, and Iran. The conquests lasted many years into the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad and built on ongoing conquests during the ED. The transition is much harder to pinpoint within an archaeological context. It <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to date a site to either ED III or Akkadian period based on ceramic or architectural evidence alone.|$|E

25|$|To not be jostled out of {{the saddle}} and to not harm the horse by {{bouncing}} on its back, riders must learn specific skills in order to sit the trot. Most riders learn to sit a slow jog trot without bouncing. A skilled rider can ride a powerfully extended trot without bouncing, but to do so requires well-conditioned back and abdominal muscles, and to do so for long periods is tiring for even experienced riders. A fast, uncollected, racing trot, such as that of the harness racing horse, <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to sit.|$|E
25|$|The {{practice}} of exhibiting killer whales born in captivity is less controversial than of retaining free-born orcas, since the captive-born orcas have known no other world {{and may not}} be able to adapt to life in the wild. Captive breeding also promises to reduce incentives to capture wild orcas. However, in January 2002 the Miami Seaquarium stated that captive orcas are dying faster than they are being born, and as it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> to obtain orcas captured from the wild, the business of exhibiting captive orcas may eventually disappear.|$|E

25|$|The case of Sanju Bhagat, {{also known}} as Sanjay Kumar, a man from Nagpur, India, {{attracted}} attention in 1999 {{for the length of}} time (36 years) he had carried his parasitic twin inside his body, {{and the size of the}} growth. Since Bhagat had no placenta, the growth had connected directly to his blood supply. In an extremely unusual case, a 2-year-old boy became pregnant with his parasitic twin inside his stomach feeding off him like a normal fetus would feed on its mother. The boy required a Caesarean section. It <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> that the fetus could survive this process due to being underdeveloped.|$|E
25|$|Trills, though {{generally}} simple with valves, {{are difficult}} on the slide trombone. Trills {{tend to be}} easiest and most effective higher in the harmonic series because the distance between notes is much smaller and slide movement is minimal. For example, a trill on B3/C4 <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> as the slide must move two positions (either 1st-to-3rd or 5th-to-3rd), however at an octave higher (B4/C5) the notes can both be achieved in 1st position as a lip trill. Thus, the most convincing trills tend to be above the first octave {{and a half of}} the tenor's range. Trills are most commonly found in early Baroque and Classical music for the trombone as a means of ornamentation, however, some more modern pieces will call for trills as well.|$|E
25|$|In his 2004 book, the Russian {{linguist}} Andrey Zaliznyak analyzes {{arguments and}} {{concludes that the}} forgery theory <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible.</b> It {{was not until the}} late 20th century, after hundreds of bark documents were unearthed in Novgorod, that scholars learned that some of the puzzling passages and words of the tale were part of common speech in the 12th century, although they were not represented in chronicles and other formal written documents. Zaliznyak concludes that no 18th-century scholar could have imitated the subtle grammatical and syntactical features in the known text. He did not believe that Dobrovský could have accomplished this, as his views on Slavic grammar (as expressed in his magnum opus, Institutiones) were strikingly different from the system written in Igor's Tale. In his revised second edition issued in 2007, Zaliznyak was able to use evidence from the posthumous edition of Zimin's 2006 book. He argued that even someone striving to imitate some older texts would have had almost impossible hurdles to overcome, as mere imitation could not have represented the deep mechanics of the language.|$|E

25|$|In versus-fighting games, a draw {{occurs when}} both players end the match through a double KO; or via time over, {{with the same}} {{percentage}} of life bar. For example, some of these games, such as Street Fighter and Tekken, require two winning rounds to win the match, and if after a third round the score ends in a 1–1 draw, the players have to fight again in an extra round. If this extra round ends in a draw, the game will end for both players. In Mortal Kombat, if a round ends when the time runs out and both players have complete life bars, the game ends for both players, because due to Mortal Kombats gameplay (in which every common hit takes block damage) it <b>is</b> <b>virtually</b> <b>impossible</b> for a round to end tied, {{and that means the}} players were not playing for real. In the Super Smash Bros. series, if two players have equal lives {{at the end of a}} tied match a sudden death period begins with each player having 300% damage, essentially making it so a single hit can win the game.|$|E
