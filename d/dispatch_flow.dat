40|$|Wind {{power is}} one of the most popular {{renewable}} energy resources in the world. However, the variability of wind power leads to a situation in which a wind turbine only system cannot exist. Optimization of wind power <b>flow</b> <b>dispatch</b> is a long term work. And the variable wind generation in optimal power <b>flow</b> <b>dispatching</b> by mathematical model is an initial step in the operational process. It is because that the mathematical module in simulation software is almost no cost, simple and easy to go. The assumption in this thesis is that wind turbine is sited in the same location as the Plymouth. [8] The cost of being sited in a research different location and long distance power transmission will be discussed as future research. The optimization modelling is built using Scilab simulation. Scilab is an engineering simulation software, and Scialb is similar with MATLAB. The characteristic of Scilab is the open source coding. It is means users can coding program by using Scilab languages as their requirement. To built a network, the equation of different cost has been distinguished, which include the thermal only system cost as a test system, and the wind power cost. The variable value of wind information is set as wind turbine scheduled power rather than wind speed. For a given system, the scheduled power canbe calculated from wind speed, however, the wind speed calculation is not animportant partof this paper, and it is only briefly discussed. This study present a method to incorporate, the variable wind generation in optimal power <b>flow</b> <b>dispatching</b> and can find the best power set up by calculating scheduled power of wind turbine and generators power.

30|$|Source {{location}} {{methods have}} been presented that use energy-based methods [19, 20]. These methods depend upon measurements of the power flow to trace oscillations to their source. However, power flow based tracing requires PMU observability of the power flows at the potential sources to function correctly, which limits their practical use in power systems with sparse PMU monitoring or for oscillations where the sources are unmonitored. Other methods use offline statistical analysis [21] of system data (e.g. <b>dispatch,</b> power <b>flow</b> measurements, estimated oscillation parameters) to identify correlations between oscillations and certain operating conditions, which may indicate a source location if a causal relationship can then be established through further investigation. These methods are well suited for source location with respect to oscillations that have repeat occurrences. However, by their nature, they are not suitable for online application or for dealing with oscillations that occur less frequently, {{due to a lack}} of sufficient data. This may be of concern for future systems that have far greater range of operating conditions and possible oscillatory interactions.|$|R

Exact solutions are a time consuming task with increased functional complexity, which calls for heuristic methods while dealing with the sequencing and scheduling of drug batches on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. This paper proposes a modified beam search method which employs dispatching rules for selecting the next batch in the sequence, and evaluates the schedule performance in terms of flow-times and due-date-based measures. The efficiency of the method is justified by using data from a pharmaceutical firm as a real-world test case. Extensive simulation experimentation reveals solutions for the firm which minimise the total setup times responding satisfactory to due-date objectives as well.

Today, {{little is known about}} how to effectively exploit this potential. We study a model where flows are transferred over multiple parallel networks, each of which is modeled as a processor sharing node. The goal is to minimize the expected transfer time of elastic data traffic by smartly <b>dispatching</b> the <b>flows</b> to the networks, based on partial information about the numbers of foreground and background flows in each of the nodes. In the case of full state information, the optimal policy can be derived via standard MDP-techniques, but for models with partial information an optimal solution is hard to obtain. An important requirement is that the splitting algorithm is efficient, yet simple, easy-to-implement, scalable in the number of parallel networks and robust against changes in the parameter settings. We propose a simple index rule for splitting traffic streams based on partial information, and benchmark the results against the optimal solution in the case of full state information.

An important task of an IGO is congestion management (CM) and pricing. This activity has significant economic implications on every market participant in the IGO’s region. The paper briefly reviews the CM schemes and the associated pricing mechanism used by the IGOs in five representative schemes. These were selected to illustrate the various CM approaches in use: England and Wales, Norway, Sweden, PJM, and California. We develop a unified framework for the mathematical representation of the market dispatch and redispatch problems that the IGO must solve in CM in these various jurisdictions. We use this unified framework to develop meaningful metrics to compare the various CM approaches so as to assess their efficiency and the effectiveness of the market signals provided to the market participants.
