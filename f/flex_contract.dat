5000|$|One of the {{elements}} that is commonly known within the Robot dance community is the robot pose. One pose can {{be followed by a}} series of poses. These poses are often followed by [...] "hits" [...] or [...] "dime stops" [...] (definition: the techniques of quickly <b>flexing</b> and <b>contracting</b> body muscles to cause a hard, immediate stop in the person’s movement). Basic Robot movement can also be associated with the art of mime movement, both with and without music. Like many neighborhoods in the Northern California Bay Area, Richmond historically had predominantly African-American communities during these time periods. Thus, the existence of R&B, Soul and Funk music has associated ties with its social dances and its Robot dance styles. This type of Robot movement incorporates [...] "funk-oriented" [...] and [...] "soulful" [...] moves, poses and dances. Many young individuals who were growing up in the city of Richmond during this time not only moved and danced like Robots, but also created groups which performed Robot dance routines. These various groups of Robot dancers and their routines eventually became known as [...] "Richmond Robottin’" [...] throughout the communities via the performances at the frequently held Talent Shows at the Richmond Memorial Auditorium.|$|R
40|$|How {{many times}} have we all jotted down a list to take with us to the supermarket? Even a simple {{vertical}} column of ordinary household items requires more than we realize. We scan areas {{of the house and}} pull from memory different food stuffs or supplies that need to be replenished or replaced: refrigerator (need milk, butter, juice); cabinets (we’re out of sandwich bags and sponges); canisters (need coffee and tea); laundry room (need detergent and bleach); dinner (… [...] good question). All this information requires a flow of memory, organization, and planning. Most of us do this part of the task spontaneously and routinely. Now we need to create that list on paper. As automatic as it seems, writing simple words like “coffee,” “sandwich, ” and “juice, ” requires a call-up of a sequence of letters and shapes for each word—spelling [...] and an ability to manipulate the pen or pencil in order to encode the letters. During the physical act of jotting down a list, we control several muscle groups to keep the writing tool flowing in a direction— moving vertically, horizontally, and in a circular fashion (rotary movement). Fine motor coordination is key as we stimulate certain muscle groups, inhibit others, and balance, <b>flex,</b> and <b>contract</b> movements. We don’t punctuate the list, write it in a creative way, grab the attention of a reader, or develop a theme and add flourish and detail to our assertions. A list is just a list...|$|R
