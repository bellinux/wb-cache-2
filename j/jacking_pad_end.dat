25|$|Although {{trampoline}} {{competitors are}} highly trained, {{they are also}} attempting to perform complex manoeuvres {{which could lead to}} accidents and falls. Trampolines used in competitions have their springs covered in pads to reduce the chance of injury when landing off the bed. They also have <b>padded</b> <b>end</b> decks, which are the locations that athletes are most likely to fall off the trampoline. The rules for international competitions (updated by FIG in 2006) also require 200mm thick mats on the floor for 2 metres around each trampoline and for there to be four spotters whose task it is to attempt to catch or reduce the impact of an athlete falling {{off the side of the}} trampoline bed. The floor matting rules are typically adopted by national bodies but not always in full; for example in the UK the requirement for National & Regional competition is still 2m but only of 20–25mm matting.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} shearographic {{inspections}} {{of the shuttle}} external tank (ET) spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) and solid rocket booster (SRB) Marshall sprayable ablative (MSA- 2) epoxy-cork thermal protection systems (TPS) and remote manipulator system (RMS) honeycomb are presented. Debonding SOFI or MSA- 2 damage the orbiter belly tile and exposes the ET/SRB to thermal loading. Previous work with the ET/SRB showed promising results with shearography. The first area investigated was the <b>jack</b> <b>pad</b> close-out, one of many areas on the ET where foam is applied at KSC. Voids 0. 375 inch were detected in 1. 75 inch thick foam using a pressure reduction of less dm 0. 4 psi. Of primary interest are areas of the ET that directly face the orbiter tile TPS. It is estimated that 90 % of tile TPS damage on the orbiter 'belly' results from debonding SOFI during ascent. Test panels modeling these areas were manufactured with programmed debonds to determine the sensitivity of shearography {{as a function of}} debond size, SOFI thickness, and vacuum. Results show a Probability of Detection (POD) of. 95 or better for of debonds with a diameter equal to the SOFI thickness at less than 0. 4 psi pressure reduction. Preliminary results are also presented on inspections of MSA- 2 and the remote manipulator system (RMS) honeycomb material...|$|R

50|$|A gambeson (or aketon or <b>padded</b> <b>jack</b> or arming doublet) is {{a padded}} {{defensive}} jacket, worn as armour separately, or combined with mail or plate armour.

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} passenger car disc brake noise {{has been made}} using the double pulsed laser holographic technique, developed to allow simultaneous recording of three orthographic visual images of a vibrating brake system. Mechanical measurements of parameters such as disc surface strain, torque, pad deflections, pressure and noise complement the visual images for both continuous and intermittent brake noise and enable phase relationships of the component parts to be determined. Visual images of the vibrational characteristics of a noisy brake show the disc {{to be in a}} bending mode with diametral modes. The pad is seen to vibrate in a variety of modes such as bending, torsion and often a combination of both and that <b>pad</b> <b>end</b> flutter is shown to make a significant contribution to brake system noise. A series of holograms of the brake emitting first an intermittent noise and then a continuous noise show that the disc waveform is not stationary and that it is moving with respect to both the calliper and the disc. Fringe movement is shown to take place when a single hologram is viewed from different positions which provides supporting evidence that the waveform is not stationary in space. Most recent tests show that the waveform does rotate about the disc at a rate equivalent to the frequency of vibration divided by the diametral mode order...|$|R

Levels may contain hazards to make this more difficult. The player controls the marble spin, and therefore movement, and can also make the marble jump. There is a variety of power-ups available to the player, which are collected by touching them with the marble. Some levels must be completed within a Qualification time, to increase difficulty. Each level also has a [...] "Gold Time", an additional challenge to complete the level in a specified time-frame. Each gold time is always possible but usually involves finding hidden powerups and/or taking shortcuts. Some levels require a number of gems {{to be picked up}} before the level can be finished.

50|$|By the 14th century, plate armour was {{commonly}} used to supplement mail. Eventually mail was supplanted by plate for the most part, as it provided greater protection against windlass crossbows, bludgeoning weapons, and lance charges. However, mail was still widely used by many soldiers as well as brigandines and <b>padded</b> <b>jacks.</b> These three types of armour made {{up the bulk of}} the equipment used by soldiers, with mail being the most expensive. It was sometimes more expensive than plate armour. Mail typically persisted longer in less technologically advanced areas such as Eastern Europe but was in use everywhere into the 16th century.|$|R

40|$|We {{observed}} a massive hillock growth on the cathode side of test structures during electromigration experiments. This phenomenon is opposite {{to the one}} observed when high self heating thermal gradients are presents. On Al-Si-Ti films, a mass depletion occurs on the anode while hillocks grow on the cathode. The discontinuity of the grain boundary network is responsible for these effects, which are correlated to an enhanced lifetime. On Al-Cu films, hillocks appear at the negative <b>pad</b> - <b>end</b> contact segment junction and their front progagates towards the anode with a velocity proportionnal to current density.

This variant is usually referred to as <b>padded</b> <b>jack</b> and made of several (some say around 18, some even 30) layers of cotton, linen or wool.
