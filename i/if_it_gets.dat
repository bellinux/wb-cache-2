500|$|The group drew {{inspiration}} from short-lived punk bands like the Fat Sluts, The Lone Reagans and Forbidden Mule, whom Ferguson describes as [...] "like all punk bands... very fast and furious." [...] Much of the band's provocative style emerged from their origins as street performers, where to get people's attention they resorted to outrageous or theatrical tactics—the group would sometimes walk {{into the street and}} stop traffic to get noticed. [...] "Sometimes we have to do really ugly or horrendous things to get people's attention, and we're not afraid to do that.

Billy explains that the [...] "doctor" [...] {{turned out to be}} a back-alley hack who caused severe damage to Penny. Baby brings her father to help Penny, but when Jake asks point blank, [...] "Who's responsible for this girl?", Johnny replies [...] "I am", claiming responsibility out of fear that Penny will be fired <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> out that she slept with Robbie.

Baby goes to Johnny to apologize for her father's behavior. They dance, and afterwards have sex. Jake tells his family they'll be leaving early over breakfast. Marjorie says they are paid up til Sunday and Lisa protests, because she wants to sing at the end-of-season talent show. Jake gives in, and Baby continues to see Johnny despite her father's warning. She pulls Johnny off the footpath when her father is nearby, and Johnny is hurt that she won't stand up for him to her father. Robbie sees them during their argument and makes a derisive remark about [...] "going slumming" [...] with the staff. Johnny assaults him.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{positively}} {{received the}} song, complimenting Minaj's cameo and the track's production and lyrics. Andrew Winistorfer of Prefix Magazine thought that Usher {{should have gone}} with [...] "Lil Freak" [...] as the album's first big single, saying, [...] "It (OMG) doesn't come close to matching the filthy heights of [...] "Little Freak ..." [...] He also said the song was [...] "by a wide margin, the best track to be leaked from Usher's long-delayed Raymond vs. Raymond album". In his initial reaction, he pointed out flaws of the song, but said that the song [...] "could become unavoidable <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> traction on radio". Chris Ryan of MTV News called the song, [...] "slick, sexy hip-hop-infused R done to its finest". He also called the song [...] "nothing short of freak nasty," [...] and [...] "is so full of sexy sexuality that it's enough to make Tiger Woods blush". Vibe magazine commented that [...] "wedding ring is definitely off on this Usher cut", and that Nicki Minaj stole {{the scene in the}} song. Pitchfork Media commented favourably on the songs explicit nature, stating the song [...] "isn't some R. Kelly-esque devotional hymn to sexual addiction", and that [...] "The whole towering mess makes a drunken 3 a.m. threesome sound like the most epic endeavor anyone could hope for.." [...] The review also compared the song to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", stating, [...] "it pushes into [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] territory {{for the same reason that}} [...] "Cry Me a River" [...] transcended: the gigantic, operatic backing track".|$|E
500|$|The {{notion of}} using public key {{cryptography}} for data kidnapping attacks was introduced in 1996 by Adam L. Young and Moti Yung. Young and Yung critiqued the failed AIDS Information Trojan that relied on symmetric cryptography alone, the fatal flaw being that the decryption key could be extracted from the Trojan, and implemented an experimental proof-of-concept cryptovirus on a Macintosh SE/30 that used RSA and the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) to hybrid encrypt the victim's data. Since public key crypto is used, the cryptovirus only contains the encryption key. The attacker keeps the corresponding private decryption key private. Young and Yung's original experimental cryptovirus had the victim send the asymmetric ciphertext to the attacker who deciphers it and returns the symmetric decryption key it contains to the victim for a fee. Long before electronic money existed Young and Yung proposed that electronic money could be extorted through encryption as well, stating that [...] "the virus writer can effectively hold {{all of the money}} ransom until half of it is given to him. Even if the e-money was previously encrypted by the user, it is of no use to the user <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> encrypted by a cryptovirus". They referred to these attacks as being [...] "cryptoviral extortion", an overt attack that {{is part of a larger}} class of attacks in a field called cryptovirology, which encompasses both overt and covert attacks. The cryptoviral extortion protocol was inspired by the forced-symbiotic relationship between H. R. Giger's facehugger and its host in the movie Alien.|$|E
500|$|Before the film's release, {{executive}} producer and Apple Inc. co-founder Steve Jobs stated [...] "If Toy Story is a modest hit—say $75million {{at the box}} office, we'll [...] both break even. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> $100million, we'll both make money. But if it's a real blockbuster and earns $200million or so at the box office, we'll make good money, and Disney will {{make a lot of}} money." [...] Upon its release on November 22, 1995, Toy Story managed to gross more than $350million worldwide. Disney chairman Michael Eisner stated [...] "I don't think either side thought Toy Story would turn out as well as it has. The technology is brilliant, the casting is inspired, and I think the story will touch a nerve. Believe me, when we first agreed to work together, we never thought their first movie would be our 1995 holiday feature, or that they could go public on the strength of it." [...] The film's first five days of domestic release (on Thanksgiving weekend) earned it $39,071,176. The film placed first in the weekend's box office with $29,140,617 and maintained the [...] 1 position at the domestic box office for the next two weekends. Toy Story became the highest-grossing domestic film of 1995, beating Batman Forever, Apollo 13 (also starring Tom Hanks), Pocahontas, Casper, Waterworld, and GoldenEye. At the time of its release, it was the third highest-grossing animated film of all time, after The Lion King (1994) and Aladdin (1992). When not considering inflation, Toy Story is [...] 96 on the list of the highest-grossing domestic films of all time. The film had gross receipts of $191,796,233 in the U.S. and Canada and $181,757,800 in international markets for a total of $373,554,033 worldwide. At the time of its release, the film ranked as 17th highest-grossing film (unadjusted) domestically and it was the 21st highest-grossing film worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|The {{hydrophobic}} {{qualities of}} Thinsulate help prevent water absorption which helps {{to maintain the}} insulating airspace even {{in the presence of}} free water. [...] More recently, aerogel material is being added to conventional undergarments to increase the insulating properties of those garments. Polar fleece is a good insulator with good stretch, is lightweight, and dries quickly <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> wet. It is also hypoallergenic and comfortable against the skin. Polyester liners can add to the insulation and will wick perspiration away from the skin. Cotton is not recommended as it absorbs moisture and saturates easily, and will then rapidly conduct heat away from the body. Most dry-suit underwear is full length, either as a one piece or jacket and trousers, but a vest may be added for extra insulation on the torso, and a [...] "Farmer John" [...] style trousers with jacket is flexible and puts extra insulation where it is most useful.|$|E

The ball's now closer to me if it's slanted across and I'm backing my hand-eye co-ordination to avoid being lbw." [...] The day itself was very cold, with Blackwell saying, [...] "It was absolutely perishing out there. I think play should be abandoned <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> that cold." [...] After Somerset were dismissed for 272, six Somerset men came out to field sporting woollen hats. Bad light and rain meant the day ended at 2.07pm, with Lancashire on 33 for 1, 84 runs ahead.
