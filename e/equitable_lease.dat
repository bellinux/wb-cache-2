40|$|Highlights {{the pitfalls}} for tenants of {{entering}} into standard tenancy agreements without first seeking professional advice. Considers the scenario of an assured shorthold tenancy concluded for a five-year term using Oyez's standard form of tenancy agreement for letting {{to determine whether}} such an agreement, which makes no reference to a deed, can amount to a legal lease. Describes the formalities for creating a legally valid lease and looks at whether the lease could take effect as an <b>equitable</b> <b>lease</b> or a periodic tenancy. Examines the availability of statutory protection for the tenant. Cases Walsh v Lonsdale (1882) LR 21 Ch D 9 (CA...|$|E
40|$|As {{energy prices}} increase, {{agricultural}} production costs will increase, especially for fuel, irrigation, and fertilizer. Considering irrigated cotton {{production in the}} Southern High Plains of Texas, share lease agreements traditionally have not included these costs in the landlordâ€™s share of expenses. As these energy-related expenses increase disproportionately to other production costs, landowners and operators must reconsider lease agreements {{in order to ensure}} an <b>equitable</b> <b>lease</b> arrangement. Using Texas Farm Assistance data, this study will consider lease arrangements with different shares for fuel, irrigation pumping costs, and fertilizer and how each will impact the net returns for the landowner and operator with irrigated cotton in the Southern High Plains of Texas...|$|E

This article argues that a possessory right in property which is capable of enforcement {{by means of an}} order for specific performance falls within equity's jurisdiction to grant relief. The question is looked at from the perspective of (1) the hire of chattels (2) a contractual licence to occupy land and (3) <b>equitable</b> <b>leases...</b>|$|R

40|$|The Supereme Court in Bersiford (FC) v Mexfield Housing Co-operative [2011] UKSC 52 {{has ruled}} that an {{occupancy}} agreement {{which could not be}} valid as an express tenancy because it was of uncertain duration, nevertheless took effect as a lease for 90 years determinably by the landlord on one month's notice on the tenant's death or in accordance with the provisions of the agreement.

40|$|The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996 (FAIR Act) {{introduces}} several {{significant changes}} to farm commodity legislation. While these changes impact all program commodities, they have prompted considerable {{concern for the}} future of the Texas cotton industry. Changes in the farm program have prompted many landowners and tenants to evaluate their current rental arrangements and determine if changes are required. In response to considerable ensuing questions regarding the land rental market, a Lotus 1 - 2 - 3 template was developed to aid parties in determining an <b>equitable</b> <b>lease.</b> This Lotus template allows users to specify enterprise budget information for cotton farm operations and then evaluates the expected returns to producers and landowners under various lease scenarios. The landowners' results are compared with the returns from 100 % of the market transition payments and user- specified net returns for an alternative enterprise to calculate the net advantage to landowners for producing cotton under the budgeted scenario over the life of the FAIR Act. The Cotton Land Tenure Evaluation Users' Guide is a detailed explanation of how to use the Lotus Cotton Land Tenure Evaluation program. This guide instructs users on how to use the various components of the program. Sections of the Users' Guide include a preface, installation instructions, an overview of the changes in the farm program, a section describing how to input data, a description of the custom menu system, and a report section that illustrates examples of the reports that are available for printing. ...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{changes in}} {{agriculture}} policy {{and concerns about}} crop prices have increased incentives to change from traditional wheat fallow rotations to more inten-sive cropping systems. With the changes in production practices and cropping sys-tems, an imbalance of costs, returns, and risk has become apparent. This imbalance creates {{a need for a}} process that determines the <b>equitable</b> cropshare <b>lease</b> rates for more intensive dryland crop systems. For the purposes of this study, alternative lease arrangements will be assumed to be equitable if the return to the landlord is similar to the return under the traditional two-thirds/one-third cropshare arrangement for the wheat-fallow rotation. Adjustments to traditional cropshare lease arrangements may be necessary to maintain an equitable agreement between landlords and cropshare tenants. Presently, 47 percent of the agricultural land in Nebraska is leased each year, and cropshare leasing is the primary leasing arrangement throughout the state for the crop acres (Johnson, et al., 1998). In addition, dryland crop acreage in the north-west region of Nebraska is almost exclusively leased on a cropshare basis. The stan-dard cropshare percentage arrangement in the area is a two-thirds/one-third tenant-landlord share comprising over 75 percent of the lease arrangements in 1996 (Johnson, et al., 1998). Some change toward other arrangements is occurring, although adjustments are slow. Although cropping systems are changing, cropshare lease arrangements have been slow to follow (Nitchie, 1996). As recently as 1986, over 90 percent of the cropshare arrangements were a two-thirds/one-third tenant-landlord share agreement (Johnson and Lundeen, 1987). Much of the movement has been toward a three-fourths/one-fourth tenant-landlord share with an increase from two percent in 1986 (Johnson and Lundeen, 1987) to ten percent in 1996 (Johnson, et al., 1998). The increase in three-fourths/one-fourth tenant-landlord share arrangements reflects the number of dryland crop acres that are being con-verted to more intensive crop rotations...|$|R
