25|$|Few {{works of}} art have been left in situ, with the {{exception}} of a sculpture of a togatus at the “square of the Rose of the Winds” and a number of mosaics, including those in the building known as the house of Venus and in particular at the Aïn Doura Bath. This is a consequence of the discovery of Dougga’s {{works of art}} at a time when archaeological sites were robbed of their treasures and abandoned after a dig. This approach <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to preserve a certain number of mosaics with their colours intact; other mosaics that were uncovered but not removed have suffered due to their exposure to the elements.|$|E
25|$|In this {{approach}} the so-called earlier 'rhythmic' manuscripts of unheightened neumes that carry {{a wealth of}} melo-rhythmic information but not of exact pitches, are compared in large tables of comparison with relevant later 'melodic' manuscripts' that are written on lines or use double alphabetic and neumes notation over the text, but as a rule have less rhythmic refinement compared to the earlier group. However, the comparison {{between the two groups}} <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to correct what are obvious mistakes. In other instances it is not so easy to find a consensus. In 1984 Chris Hakkennes published his own transcription of the Graduale Triplex. He devised a new graphic adaptation of square notation 'simplex' in which he integrated the rhythmic indications of the two most relevant sources, that of Laon and Skt. Gallen.|$|E
25|$|At a more {{integrative}} level, {{the primary}} {{function of the}} nervous system is to control the body. It does this by extracting information from the environment using sensory receptors, sending signals that encode this information into the central nervous system, processing the information to determine an appropriate response, and sending output signals to muscles or glands to activate the response. The evolution of a complex nervous system <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> for various animal species to have advanced perception abilities such as vision, complex social interactions, rapid coordination of organ systems, and integrated processing of concurrent signals. In humans, the sophistication {{of the nervous system}} makes it possible to have language, abstract representation of concepts, transmission of culture, and many other features of human society that would not exist without the human brain.|$|E

25|$|Antibodies {{are a key}} {{component}} of the adaptive immune response, playing a central role in both in the recognition of foreign antigens and the stimulation of an immune response to them. The advent of monoclonal antibody technology <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to raise antibodies against specific antigens presented on the surfaces of tumors. Monoclonal antibodies can be acquired in the immune system via passive immunity or active immunity.The advantage of active monoclonal antibody therapy {{is the fact that the}} immune system will produce antibodies long-term, with only a short-term drug administration to induce this response. However, the immune response to certain antigens may be inadequate, especially in the elderly. Additionally, adverse reactions from these antibodies may occur because of long-lasting response to antigens. Passive monoclonal antibody therapy can ensure consistent antibody concentration, and can control for adverse reactions by stopping administration. However, the repeated administration and consequent higher cost for this therapy are major disadvantages.|$|E
25|$|When {{rules are}} broken several steps are {{commonly}} taken. First, a warning is usually given; this is commonly {{in the form}} of a private message but recent development <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> for it to be integrated into the software. Subsequent to this, if the act is ignored and warnings do not work, the member is – usually – first exiled from the forum for a number of days. Denying someone access to the site is called a ban. Bans can mean the person can no longer log in or even view the site anymore. If the offender, after the warning sentence, repeats the offense, another ban is given, usually this time a longer one. Continuous harassment of the site eventually leads to a permanent ban. In most cases, this means simply that the account is locked. In extreme cases where the offender – after being permanently banned – creates another account and continues to harass the site, administrators will apply an IP address ban or block (this can also be applied at the server level): If the IP address is static, the machine of the offender is prevented from accessing the site. In some extreme circumstances, IP address range bans or country bans can be applied; this is usually for political, licensing, or other reasons. See also: Block (Internet), IP address blocking, and Internet censorship.|$|E

In both China and Egypt, the use of small stamps for seals preceded the use of larger blocks. In China, India and Europe, printing on cloth certainly preceded printing on paper or papyrus. The process is essentially the same: in Europe special presentation impressions of prints were often printed on silk until the 17th century.

2500|$|Traditionally, the Service {{relied on}} shortwave broadcasts, {{because of their}} ability to {{overcome}} barriers of censorship, distance, and spectrum scarcity. The BBC has maintained a worldwide network of shortwave relay stations since the 1940s, mainly in former British colonies. These cross-border broadcasts have also been used in special circumstances for emergency messages to British subjects abroad, such as the advice to evacuate Jordan during the Black September incidents of September 1970. These facilities were privatised in 1997 as Merlin Communications, and later acquired and operated as part of a wider network for multiple broadcasters by VT Communications (now part of Babcock International Group). It is also common for BBC programmes to air on [...] Voice of America or ORF transmitters, while their programming is relayed by a station located inside the UK.

2500|$|In his 1868 book on Variation under Domestication, Charles Darwin {{assessed}} {{the arguments for}} single or multiple origins of dogs, and noted the paleontological research of de Blainville who proposed that dogs were descended from a single extinct species. In 1934, an eminent paleontologist indicated that the ancestor of the dog lineage {{may have been the}} extinct Canis lupus variabilis. In 1950, a morphological study of Japanese prehistoric dogs compared to extant wolves concluded: [...] "Therefore the living wolf kinds {{have nothing to do with}} the ancestral forms of the prehistoric dog races." [...] In 1999, a study emphasized that while molecular genetic data seem to support the origin of dogs from wolves, dogs may have descended from a now extinct species of canid whose closest living relative was the wolf. The dog's lineage may have been contributed to from a ghost population. The advent of rapid and inexpensive DNA sequencing technology <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to significantly increase the resolving power of genetic data taken from both modern and ancient domestic dog genomes.

The park was designed to keep the natural vegetation of the area intact except where enclosures, roads, and structures had to be constructed. Originally a sparse scrub forest invaded by weeds, consisting of species such as Carissa sp., Gmelina sp., Eugenia sp., Acacia sp., Instia sp. {{and a few other}} dry evergreen forest species, the park's vegetation was gradually enriched by planting dry evergreen species. The entire campus has been fortified by means of a compound wall, preventing any biotic interference in the park and allowing the natural growth of vegetation, which give the park the look of a natural forest. The park is built based on the 'open zoo' concept. The exhibits were originally based on taxonomic and geographical distribution of the species, but have now been replaced by ecological niches and habitats. The order of priority is local species, followed by regional, national, and international species. The use of moats <b>has</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>possible</b> to house predator and prey in extended enclosures that provide a panorama of wildlife.
