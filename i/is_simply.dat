50|$|An {{important}} factor concerning {{the care of}} true, raw (remy, virgin) human hair extensions, since this hair has had absolutely no processes, chemical or steam done, is that these extensions <b>are</b> <b>simply</b> human hair and can <b>be</b> <b>simply</b> shampooed or washed as much as desired.|$|R
5|$|The optical system, {{consisting}} {{of a combination of}} lenses and/or reflective elements, <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> described by the matrix resulting from the product of the components' matrices.|$|E
5|$|The reading 'Avete vos' is {{from the}} fifteenth century manuscripts and editions. In this case the emperor <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> {{returning}} the salutation. The literal meaning is, however, 'be well', 'be safe', or 'be sound', and the gladiators understood it as dismissing them.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} {{remedy for}} farmers of pollinated crops <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> {{to switch from}} using beekeepers {{to the use of}} native bees, such as bumble bees and mason bees. Native bees can be helped to establish themselves by providing suitable nesting locations and some additional crops the bees could use to feed from (e.g. when the pollination season of the commercial crops on the farm has ended).|$|E

5|$|As {{biologists}} define macroevolution, both microevolution and macroevolution {{have been}} observed. Speciations, for example, have been directly observed many times, despite popular misconceptions to the contrary. Additionally, the modern evolutionary synthesis draws no distinction in the processes {{described by the}} theory of evolution when considering macroevolution and microevolution as the former <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> at the species level or above and the latter is below the species level. An example of this is ring species.|$|E
5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an allele, {{at any given time}} the probability that an allele will eventually become fixed in the population <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> its frequency in the population at that time. For example, if the frequency p for allele A is 75% and the frequency q for allele B is 25%, then given unlimited time the probability A will ultimately become fixed in the population is 75% and the probability that B will become fixed is 25%.|$|E
5|$|Brandon Stosuy, of Pitchfork Media, {{talked of}} a black metal {{influence}} in the album's imagery. Anderson responded to the claim of black metal influence by stating {{that he does not}} know why people compare his music to black metal; he hypothesized that it <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> the raw production of the music, or the double 'i' in the band name.|$|E

5|$|Every {{driver of}} a CMV is {{required}} {{to keep track of}} his/her time with a log book or an ELD. A log book <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with the driver (to be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E
5|$|Georgian {{characters}} {{are found in}} two Unicode blocks. The first block (U+10A0–U+10FF) <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> called Georgian.

The second block is the Georgian Supplement (U+2D00–U+2D2F), and it contains Nuskhuri.|$|E
5|$|In a {{different}} reading, Shakespearean scholar Eric Sams has interpreted this reference to spiritual communion as {{an allusion to}} Barnabe Barnes, a notorious English occultist and poet, while others contend that {{the significance of the}} spirit <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> an allusion to poetic genius and that it contains no reference to an actual personage.|$|E
50|$|We {{defined a}} number to <b>be</b> <b>simply</b> normal in base b if each {{individual}} digit appears with frequency 1/b. For a given base b, a number can <b>be</b> <b>simply</b> normal (but not normal or b-dense), b-dense (but not simply normal or normal), normal (and thus simply normal and b-dense), or none of these. A number is absolutely non-normal or absolutely abnormal if it <b>is</b> not <b>simply</b> normal in any base.|$|R

5|$|It was {{formerly}} {{thought that the}} dust was {{left over from the}} formation of the cluster, but at the age of about 100 million years generally accepted for the cluster, almost all the dust originally present would have been dispersed by radiation pressure. Instead, it seems that the cluster <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> passing through a particularly dusty region of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|Other methods {{also exist}} for {{describing}} polygonal tilings. When the tessellation {{is made of}} regular polygons, the most common notation is the vertex configuration, which <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> {{a list of the}} number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 44. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 63.|$|E
5|$|The Internet {{has helped}} autistic {{individuals}} bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing {{that they find}} so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely.

5|$|The Main Stand is {{the oldest}} in Prenton Park, having been opened in December 1968. It is also the largest, with a {{capacity}} of 5,957. A two tier stand, it is generally divided into three main sections.

The upper tier <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> referred to as the Main Stand (capacity 3,598).|$|E
5|$|The W427's name is {{the result}} of a {{combination}} of factors. W is to honour the founder of HSV, Tom Walkinshaw. The 427 <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> the engine capacity in cubic inches, but it is also a nod to the HRT 427C, which won the 2002 and 2003 Bathurst 24 Hour motor races.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} climate change on teleosts could be {{powerful}} but are complex. For example, increased winter precipitation (rain and snow) could harm populations of freshwater fish in Norway, whereas warmer summers could increase growth of adult fish. In the oceans, teleosts may be able to cope with warming, as it <b>is</b> <b>simply</b> an extension of natural variation in climate. It is uncertain how ocean acidification, caused by rising carbon dioxide levels, might affect teleosts.|$|E
