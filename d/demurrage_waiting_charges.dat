Helen heard in the whisper of the wind through the pine the old-earth story, beautiful, ever new, and yet eternal. She thrilled to her depths.

50|$|Production {{problems}} with the Eclipse led to a rash of lawsuits in the late 1970s. Newer versions of the machine were pre-ordered by many of DG's customers, which were never delivered. Many customers sued Data General {{after more than a}} year of <b>waiting,</b> <b>charging</b> the company with breach of contract, while others simply canceled their orders and went elsewhere. The Eclipse was originally intended to replace the Nova outright, evidenced by the fact that the Nova 3 series, released at the same time and utilizing virtually the same internal architecture as the Eclipse, was phased out the next year. Strong demand continued for the Nova series, resulting in the Nova 4, perhaps as a result of the continuing {{problems with}} the Eclipse.|$|R
60|$|It was, perhaps, on this {{occasion}} that Mr. Thompson stayed later than usual. As he turned his face toward the city, lights were beginning to twinkle ahead, and a fierce wind, made visible by fog, drove him forward, or, lying in <b>wait,</b> <b>charged</b> him angrily {{from the corners of}} deserted suburban streets. It was on one of these corners that something else, quite as indistinct and malevolent, leaped upon him with an oath, a presented pistol, and a demand for money. But it was met by a will of iron and a grip of steel. The assailant and assailed rolled together on the ground. But the next moment the old man was erect; one hand grasping the captured pistol, the other clutching at arm's length the throat of a figure, surly, youthful, and savage.|$|R
40|$|Environment {{preservation}} {{has become}} a prominent issue a-round the world. As traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles have been major contributors of air pollution, electric vehicles (EVs) are gaining popularity. However, due to the limited electricity supply of battery pack, EVs need to be charged frequently and each charge takes long time. This may degrade travel efficiency and driver comfort. To address this issue, this paper aims to minimize <b>charging</b> <b>waiting</b> time through intelligently scheduling charging activities spatially and temporally. A theoretical study has been conducted to formulate the <b>waiting</b> time minimized <b>charging</b> scheduling problem and derive a performance upper bound (i. e., the theoretical lower bound of <b>charging</b> <b>waiting</b> time). Based on the insights discovered from the theoretical analysis, a practical distributed scheme has been proposed. Extensive simulation results verify that the proposed design can achieve a waiting time near the theoretical lower bound...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} a {{time-sharing}} system in which users may join after paying an appropriate toll and are subjected to service and <b>waiting</b> <b>charges.</b> The form of an optimal joining policy that minimizes the expected loss of users who may join the system at some of its queues is derived, and is {{shown to be a}} control-limit policy with a single control number for every possible entry queue; a newly arriving user will join the minimal-priority entry queue that is not filled up to its contrl number. Tolls and charges that maximize the average expected revenue of the system, as well as the control numbers, are determined for a round-robin time-sharing system. A multi-entrance foreground-background time-sharing system with random entrance is analyzed and the characteristics of the system, such as expected waiting times and expected number of waiting users in each queue, are given. It is shown that when the entry into this system is based on tolls and charges, there exists a set of prices (and associated control numbers) that maximizes the discounted expected revenues of the system...|$|R

50|$|Private {{adoption}} agencies, like {{attorneys in}} an independent adoption, can charge what they feel is appropriate for the services rendered. To perform the home study, provide counseling and take the birth parent's relinquishment, the fee can range from $5,000 to $50,000. Like independent adoption, the birth mother may have expenses for the adoptive parents to provide. Public agencies, finding homes for <b>waiting</b> children, <b>charge</b> either no fee, or not in excess of $500. The government basically underwrites the cost to find homes for children who otherwise would be staying in foster care and benefit from a permanent and loving home.|$|R

30|$|Electric taxis are {{different}} from electric buses and electric cars as the main charging mode is fast charging. With fast charging mode, charging strategy is meaningless because the taxies drivers are waiting beside their taxis and they want their taxis to be fully charged as soon as possible.

If the number of charging generators cannot meets the needs of taxis, there taxis form a queue <b>waiting</b> for <b>charging.</b> The station will follow the rule of first-come-first-served.

40|$|Charging {{management}} for Electric Vehicles (EVs) on-the-move (moving {{on the road}} with certain trip destinations) is becoming important, concerning the increasing popularity of EVs in urban city. However, the limited battery volume of EV certainly influences its driver’s experience. This is mainly because the EV needed for intermediate charging during trip, may experience a long service <b>waiting</b> time at <b>Charging</b> Station (CS). In this paper, we focus on CS-selection decision making to manage EVs’ charging plans, aiming to minimize drivers’ trip duration through intermediate charging at CSs. The anticipated EVs’ charging reservations including their arrival time and expected charging time at CSs, are brought for charging management, in addition to taking the local status of CSs into account. Compared to applying traditionally applying cellular network communication to report EVs’ charging reservations,we alternatively study the feasibility of applying Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V 2 V) communication with Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) nature, due primarily to its flexibility and cost-efficiency in Vehicular Ad hoc NETworks (VANETs). Evaluation results under the realistic Helsinki city scenario show that applying the V 2 V for reservation reporting is promisingly cost-efficient in terms of communication overhead for reservation making, while achieving a comparable performance in terms of <b>charging</b> <b>waiting</b> time and total trip duration...|$|R
30|$|Queuing Theory {{researches}} on {{the property}} of queuing phenomenon, such as the length of queue, the waiting time and busy time periods. With the help of optimal algorithm, Queuing Theory is able {{to solve the problem}} between good quality of service and economy. When applying for fast charging station, Queuing Theory focuses on the number of taxis waiting in line, customers’ average <b>waiting</b> time, <b>charging</b> load and the needs number of charging generators which is parameter c in M/M/c queuing model. The customers’ waiting time {{is the only thing that}} customers concern about. The number of charging generators affects the property of queue. The more generators, the less waiting time there will be. But more generators raise the total investment of the station [20]. So it is important to find the proper number of generators. For a station that has already constructed, the cost of equipment is sunk cost. So the maximum number of generators is fixed. But the station can adjust the number of generators in use.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} the (non-cooperative) competition of a duopoly of make-toorder firms, each modeled by an M/M/ 1 queue. The firms post the prices they charge for service.

We consider both the short-run competition and the long-run competition. In the short run, the service capacities of both firms are given, and the firms maximize their expected revenues by choosing prices only. In the long run, the rms maximize their expected profits by choosing both prices and service capacities. In the short run, a Nash equilibrium may not exist, and when it exits, it may not be unique. Given all else being the same, a firm with a larger capacity, or a higher value of service or a lower cost of <b>waiting</b> can <b>charge</b> a price premium and take a larger market share.
