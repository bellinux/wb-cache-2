500|$|Feeling guilty, Jerry ends {{up going}} to the funeral, where he, again, apologizes for his remark. Isaac informs him that Manya had {{forgotten}} Jerry made the pony remark: [...] "Oh, no no no. She forgot all about that. She was much more upset about the potato salad." [...] Elaine asks Isaac multiple times about what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> their apartment. Isaac eventually tells her that Jerry's cousin Jeffrey is {{going to live in}} it. When it starts to rain, Jerry realizes that the game will be postponed. The following day, after the game, Jerry, George and Elaine meet at Monk's Café, where they discuss the lousy way Jerry played softball. (Jerry recalls a certain play, about which he admits, [...] "It was the single worst moment of my life.") Elaine wonders if Manya's spirit put a spell on him.|$|E
500|$|This {{episode was}} written by series creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld, in their second episode for this season, and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones, also his second episode this season, {{during the course of}} the second production season. This episode was based on a remark David once made during a conversation. Cherones deliberately made Elaine sit at a smaller table while directing the dinner scene. [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was the first episode in which Kramer wants to gamble, it is later established that he has a gambling addiction. The idea of Elaine asking Isaac what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> his old apartment was added during rehearsals. The first table reading of the episode was held on October 24, 1990, and a run through was held two days later. [...] "The Pony Remark" [...] was filmed in front of a live audience on October 30, 1990, while Seinfeld's stand-up routine was filmed one day earlier, along with the performances used in [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend" [...] and [...] "The Busboy"; Seinfeld would change wardrobe between takes.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} stages of the album's development, it was {{promoted}} as an album of [...] "high-energy hip-hop." [...] Republic Records later described the album's musical style as [...] "aggressive rock" [...] in the stages preceding the album's release. Vanilla Ice referred to the album's musical style as [...] "skate rock." [...] The album's dark and thick sound fuses elements of heavy metal, punk rock and hip hop. Vanilla Ice stated that [...] "I wanted to express myself in a very intense way, and there was no way it was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> a drum machine. Basically, I'm bored with drum machines and samples and stuff. With a band, they can build the energy around me." [...] Many critics have noticed a similarity between the style of music present on Hard to Swallow and that of bands such as Korn and Limp Bizkit. Vanilla Ice stated that although he knew of the bands, he [...] "didn't even listen to [...] any of them" [...] before he made the album, and he was not trying to imitate the musical style of the bands. [...] "It's just we have the same producer, and some of the guitars between that and Limp Bizkit are gonna sound similar. That's what happens when you've got the same guy producing them. [...] I had heard the Deftones more than any of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Another main {{characteristic}} of the Briton, especially of the [...] "working" [...] Briton, is improvidence--he likes, unconsciously, to live from hand to mouth, careless of the morrow.

5000|$|Well, you {{are about}} to start the {{greatest}} improvisation of all. With no script.

Would you like to write the last issue of Batman and the last issue of Detective Comics? And when they make an offer like that, you say yes." ...|$|R
500|$|Nicole's {{best friend}} during her initial storylines was Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance). After Brendan Austin (Kain O'Keeffe) caused Roman to go blind, {{he took his}} anger out on Nicole and Aden. Subsequently they became [...] "each other's support network" [...] and Lasance {{said it was not}} long {{afterward}} that they [...] "slipped between the sheets". One of the conditions of Aden's tenancy was to never sleep with Nicole, this made the pair feel guilty that they had deceived Roman. Lasance felt the storyline was controversial as he had a strong fan base for his relationship with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) - which meant he knew it would [...] "cause a stir" [...] and divide the audience. In January2010, Nicole and Aden [...] "get up close and personal" [...] and they decided to spend Aden's remaining time in the Bay together. They shared a kiss and James told TV Week that there are [...] "a lot of complications" [...] for them. She said that no one knew what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) and that Nicole felt guilty for betraying Belle because she was her friend. James explained that Nicole's pairing with Aden was [...] "a bit more serious and in-depth than her usual relationships." [...] James opined that Aden was the [...] "nicer guy" [...] for Nicole, but Liam may have had [...] "the edge she's after." [...] Nicole and Aden then embarked on a relationship. James thought that Nicole and Aden's relationship was great and said [...] "They started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more." [...] Nicole declared her love for Aden, however he did not reciprocate. Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: [...] "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden." [...] Aden appreciated her love for him, however cannot say it back until he felt the same way. It is this that made their relationship [...] "awkward", Nicole tried to withdraw her declaration and hide her hurt feelings.|$|E

2500|$|In a June 2016 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Stefani expressed uncertainty {{with the future}} of No Doubt. [...] "I don't know what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> No Doubt. When Tony [...] and I are connected creatively, it's magic. But I think we've grown apart {{as far as what}} kind of music we want to make. I was really drained and burned out when we recorded that album [...] And I had a lot of guilt: 'I have to do it.' That's not the right setting to make music. There's some really great writing on that record. But the production felt really conflicted. It was sad how we all waited that long to put something out and it didn't get heard." ...|$|E
5000|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Bigmouth gigged all over town, {{building}} a substantial following via energetic performances and a self-released CD. They were courted {{by a number of}} major labels, but never quite closed the deal. By 1997, Hicken was disillusioned and decided to call it quits. [...] "I couldn't do it anymore," [...] he recalls. [...] "I was in pieces. I'd show up for rehearsal and have these massive anxiety attacks. I had spent my whole life telling myself I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a rock star, and then I realized it wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> Dealing <b>with</b> that really crushed me.” ...|$|R
500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. I was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let that <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|R
500|$|According to the Los Angeles Times, [...] "Martin's {{brilliance}} in evoking atmosphere through {{description is}} an enduring hallmark of his fiction, the settings {{much more than}} just props on a painted stage", and the novels captivate readers with [...] "complex storylines, fascinating characters, great dialogue, perfect pacing, and the willingness to kill off even his major characters". CNN remarked that [...] "the story weaves through differing points of view in a skillful mix of observation, narration and well-crafted dialogue that illuminates both character and plot with fascinating style", and David Orr of The New York Times found that [...] "All of his hundreds of characters have grace notes of history and personality that advance a plot line. Every town has an elaborately recalled series of triumphs and troubles." [...] Salon.com's Andrew Leonard [...] "couldn't stop reading Martin because my desire to know what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> combined <b>with</b> my absolute inability to guess what would happen and left me helpless before his sorcery. At the end, I felt shaken and exhausted." [...] The Christian Science Monitor advised reading the novels with an A Song of Ice and Fire encyclopedia at hand to [...] "catch all the layered, subtle hints and details that [...] leaves throughout his books. If you pay attention, you will be rewarded and questions will be answered." ...|$|R
2500|$|In August 2011, Rawle {{revealed}} that Silas's storyline would soon {{come to a}} conclusion. He told This Morning [...] " [...] We've been waiting {{a long time to}} see what's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> Silas and over the next three months we've got some cracking storylines which end in an awful climax, which I can't say anything about." [...] The actor also opined that Silas's family would be [...] "ripped asunder" [...] after finding out that he is a killer. Marquess first mentioned the storyline's climax in January 2011. He told Digital Spy [...] "I know what the ending of the serial killer story will be, when it is, and I know how brilliant it is. I'm hoping that story will have the audience jumping up and down and shouting at the telly, because it's got a really big 'look behind you' element to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2010, Duncan Smith {{studied a}} state-sponsored {{relationship}} education programme in Norway, under which couples {{were forced to}} [...] "think again" [...] and confront the reality of divorce before formally separating. The policy has been credited with reversing Norway’s trend for rising divorce rates and halting the decline of marriage in the country over the past 15 years. Duncan Smith said he was keen to explore ways in which similar approaches could be encouraged in Britain. Officials pointed out that such a programme would be expensive but that an approach could reduce the long-term cost of family breakdown, which has been estimated at up to £100billion. Duncan Smith said couples in Norway were able to [...] "work through what is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> <b>with</b> their children", which has [...] "a very big effect on their thinking". [...] "Many of them think again {{about what they are}} going to embark on once they really understand the consequences of their actions subsequently," [...] he said.|$|E
60|$|The {{sound of}} the opening door did not startle Elsie, because of her curious feeling that {{something}} unusual was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen.</b> <b>With</b> {{a quick glance at}} the window she decided not to put out the light.

Then it struck her that she had not heard a key being turned or a bolt drawn; but the door fastenings were carefully oiled. Staffer had had this seen to, after having had difficulty with his latchkey one night.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{features}} {{the death of}} Jeremy Davies character Daniel Faraday. Daniel {{was introduced in the}} fourth season and was originally intended to be a minor character only. However, his quiet demeanor and seemingly good heart made him a favorite with the fans, so Lindelof and Cuse decided to expand Daniel's role, which has led to him being a key player in Losts eventual resolution. In response to Daniel's death, Cuse said, [...] "It was an incredibly painful thing to kill this beloved character, but we feel that’s what this show has to do. His death is kind of the culminating event in the entire season. It really ends one chapter and commences the start of the final chapter of the entire series." [...] Once the show runners explained that to Davies, he was saddened that his full-time status on Lost was coming to an end, but put the story [...] "above his own personal self". Damon seconded Carlton's emotions, adding that Jeremy took the news well: [...] "When Carlton and I called Jeremy to explain what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>happening</b> <b>with</b> Daniel, we’ve never had a more awesome exit interview with somebody on the show. For us, Daniel really was the cornerstone of the fifth season – he really shined. I can’t imagine what Season 5 would have looked like without Jeremy Davies. When you think about all the crazy stuff that had to come out of that guy’s mouth, for him to be as interesting and emotional and poetic as he was is really extraordinary." [...] The cast of the show said Davies would be missed, though he may not be done with Lost — Carlton commented that Jeremy's [...] "full-time" [...] status was over, but dead characters have been known to reappear on the show. Michael Emerson, who plays Ben, said Davies was [...] "a great sensitive guy who got deep into his character, he really lived it." ...|$|R
30|$|Teachers {{believe that}} {{struggle}} and even failure are inherent yet valuable {{components of the}} engineering design process within STEM education (finding 6). Students are asked to improve upon their designs and solutions. They are encouraged to take risks. Teachers feel this is beneficial to students, especially high-achieving students that typically do not reach a point of frustration in their classrooms (Dare et al. 2014). Because failure {{is part of the}} process, it is expected and therefore accepted. This encourages students to do things they {{do not know how to}} do and challenge themselves to confront failure. Teachers feel this helps encourage students to think for themselves and better understand the content in their classes by thinking critically about it (Holstein and Keene 2013). Teachers value these authentic learning experiences, without one right answer (Bruce-Davis et al. 2014). They felt students needed lots of practice participating in group work and learning through doing in order to be successful with STEM learning (El-Deghaidy et al. 2017; Herro and Quigley 2017). Several teachers were happily surprised that low-performing students were able to be successful in the less-structured and more challenging STEM problems (Lesseig et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2011). Teachers even reported that students were reluctant to begin with the STEM equipment because they were afraid it would be damaged. Students had to learn that making mistakes was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>happen</b> and experimenting <b>with</b> the equipment would help them solve their STEM problem (Dare et al. 2014).|$|R
