25|$|M3E2/M5 Half-track – International Harvester Half-Track, {{externally}} largely {{identical to}} the M3, but with , IHC RED-450-B engine, different drive train and fuel and electrical system. In fact, only the chassis, bogies, track, idler and <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> <b>wheels,</b> winches, transfer case, rollers, and machine gun mount were interchangeable. The M5 is heavier than the M3, {{due in part to}} heavier armor. Its body was welded, rather than bolted. The M5 was primarily for Lend-Lease, to Britain, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union.|$|R
5000|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of the M9 bazooka with its more powerful rocket—the M6A3—in late 1943, reports of the weapon's effectiveness against enemy armor decreased alarmingly in the latter stages of World War II, as new German tanks with thicker and better-designed armor plate and Schurzen armor skirts/spaced armor were introduced. This development forced bazooka operators to target less well-protected areas of the vehicle, such as the tracks, <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> <b>wheels,</b> or rear engine compartment. In a letter dated May 20, 1944, Gen. George S. Patton stated to a colleague that [...] "the purpose of the bazooka is not to hunt tanks offensively, but {{to be used as a}} last resort in keeping tanks from overrunning infantry. To insure this, the range should be held to around 30 yards." ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{tracked vehicle}} uses a {{combination}} of wheels and rollers, including <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> idler <b>wheels,</b> track return rollers and road wheels. It is quite similar in concept to a conveyor belt, only instead of a machine carrying objects {{on top of a}} powered continuous belt, it's a machine that moves itself over a continuous belt. In a typical application, power is transmitted to a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (or <b>drive</b> <b>wheel),</b> which drives the track around its loop. On {{the opposite end of the}} vehicle, there is an idler wheel, which provides a pulley wheel of sorts. On some applications, the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler <b>wheel</b> carry some of the weight of the vehicle, for the purposes of this description, we will assume the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler <b>wheel</b> are not weight-bearing units, and the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> is on the front (see M4 Sherman for an example). Since the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> can be at either the front (M4 Sherman) or the rear (M1 Abrahms) of the vehicle depending on the design, the idler wheel either carries the track back off the ground and returns it to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (rear idler <b>wheel),</b> or receives track from the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and lays it down in front of the road wheels (front idler wheel). The idler wheel is not powered, just like an idler gear. Although it technically reverses the tracks direction (but not its rotation), this has nothing to do with the term [...] "idler"; it is not related to an idler gear other than that they are both [...] "idle", or not doing any work, only transmitting power ("idle" [...] being a term for something or someone who isn't working). The road wheels are a series of non-powered <b>wheels</b> between the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and idler <b>wheel</b> that serve to support the weight of the vehicle (and thus aren't considered [...] "idle", even though they are unpowered). In higher speed applications, such as tanks and other AFV's, these road wheels are typically given some sort of suspension system to ease the ride, increase controllability, and decrease wear and tear. Due to the complications in adding suspension systems to the idler wheel and, in particular, the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> in such vehicles, the road wheels typically carry all of the weight of the vehicle. In low speed applications, such as bulldozers, these road wheels lack any kind of suspension system, as the low speeds don't demand the cushioning. This also allows the idler and drive wheels to carry some of the weight, as their lack of suspension is made irrelevant. Track return rollers may or may not be used, and are simply small rollers which support the weight of the track as it's transferred from rear to front to be laid down again.The track simply provides a solid [...] "road" [...] for the road wheels to roll over on over all surfaces: the road wheels roll the vehicle along the self-created [...] "road", while the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> forces the vehicle forward along the track and lays down [...] "fresh" [...] track. The idler picks the [...] "used" [...] track back up, and returns it back to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> in the front. This is why an early term for a tracked vehicle was a [...] "track-laying machine" [...] (not to be confused with railroad track laying equipment). Transporting vehicles over muddy ground often required planks or logs to be placed along the track (see corduroy road, plank road). In the later 19th century, inventors figured out a way to make a rolling machine that would lay its own plank road wherever it went, negating the need for farmers to lay down logs in order to traverse muddy areas. Other benefits were discovered later.|$|R
50|$|The Royal Marines {{also tested}} a single {{example of a}} {{half-track}} Hathi conversion, using tracks by the Roadless company. This was a relatively simple conversion, a Roadless speciality, using the existing rear axle of the Hathi as a combined <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and road <b>wheel,</b> with a two-wheel bogie and roadwheel idler ahead of this.|$|R
50|$|Vollmer {{subsequently}} {{moved to}} Czechoslovakia, {{to join the}} Skoda company for whom he designed a wheel/track light tank, the KH-50 (Kolo-Housenka). This design had roadwheels mounted on the <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> and jockey <b>wheels</b> behind them to support the tracks. Despite impressive specifications for the period - 13 mm armour, 37 mm turret-mounted armament, and a 50 hp engine capable of driving the tank at 8 mph (on tracks) and 22 mph (on wheels) - it {{was rejected by the}} Czech army.|$|R
5000|$|The {{suspension}} {{was of the}} Christie type, {{with long}} helical springs (in tension) angled back to keep the hull sides low. Of the five road wheels each side, four had shock absorbers. The tracks were <b>driven</b> by <b>sprocketed</b> <b>wheels</b> at the rear and tension adjusted at the front idler, this being standard British practice. Some variants were produced with 14 in tracks; later, 15.5-inch tracks were used. As with previous Christie-suspension cruiser tanks, there were no track return rollers, the track being supported instead {{on the tops of}} the road wheels, known as the [...] "slack-track" [...] design. The side of the hull was made up of two spaced plates, the suspension units between them, and the outer plate having cutouts for the movement of the road-wheel axles.|$|R
50|$|After World War I the Polish army {{began the}} design of tankettes, light tanks, and armored vehicles, many by Škoda. A German {{engineer}} Joseph Vollmer after the war, joined Škoda and designed a wheel/track light tank, the KH-50 (Kolo-Housenka). This design had roadwheels mounted on the <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> and jockey <b>wheels</b> behind them to support the tracks. During World War I, Vollmer was chief designer for the German War Department's motor vehicle section, and he had designed the World War I German tanks A7V, K-Wagen, LK I and LK II. Despite the new design for the KH-50 (Kolo-Housenka) impressive specifications for the period - 13 mm armour, 37 mm turret-mounted armament, and a 50 hp engine capable of driving the tank at 8 miles per hour (13 km/h) (on tracks) and 22 miles per hour (35 km/h) (on wheels) - it {{was rejected by the}} Czech army.|$|R

30|$|The {{conveying}} {{monitoring module}} comprises a seedling storage monitoring module, a seedling taking monitoring module, and a cup-type circulating conveying monitoring module. The monitoring module includes a pressure sensor {{and a lack}} of seedling indicator light. A PVDF pressure sensor (response time <[*] 1  ms, response point <[*] 200  g, range 0 – 50  kg) was arranged on the slot-wheeled seedling storage tray and used to detect whether there is a potted vegetable seedling tray waiting to be delivered. According to the change of the pressure signal, the controller directs the motor to <b>drive</b> the <b>sprocket</b> <b>wheel</b> of the storage plate and carries out the transfer of the seedling plate. By setting a stroke switch on the sprocket conveyor belt, the position of the seedling tray conveying is detected, and the push rod mechanism is triggered to perform the pushing action, and the seedling tray is moved from the seedling storage mechanism to the seedling tray conveyor belt. A finite position sensor is arranged at the junction between the conveyor belt of the seedling tray and the push rod mechanism. When it is detected that the seedling tray enters the conveyor belt from the storage mechanism, the signal is sent to the controller to stop the pushing action. The stability of the conveying action is ensured. The abnormal extraction of seedling was obtained by detecting the pressure change of the seedling pushing mechanism by pressure sensor. The potted vegetable seedling is taken out from the seedling tray and conveyed to the conveying mechanism. The CCD camera is arranged above the conveying track of the cup to monitor the leakage and load status of the potted vegetable seedling in the cups and to obtain the conveying information.|$|R

50|$|Among modern tractors, {{the high}} <b>drive</b> (elevated <b>sprocket)</b> design {{is unique to}} Caterpillar products. The concept {{originated}} in 1914 with Caterpillar predecessor C. L. Best Tractor's 30 Humpback; this tractor was discontinued a year later, and the only other tractor to use the concept until the D10's introduction was the Cletrac Model F, built between 1920 and 1922. The elevated sprocket eliminates the final drive system, inclined to frequent failure. This elevated <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> undercarriage was built in modular form; breakdown of the tracks and removal of the <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> was much easier. The transmission can {{be removed from the}} rear because of the modular design. As the engine and drivetrain are mounted high in a traditional bulldozer, the half shafts from the differential exit above the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> requiring a small gear {{on the end of the}} half shaft and another, larger one attached to the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> The high-drive system eliminates the traditional final drive in favor of the planetary final drive, which withstands engine torque better, since it distributes the forces over multiple gear teeth instead of a single tooth as in the traditional system. The disadvantage is that the track moves around one more sprocket, reducing track life. Caterpillar claims to have alleviated this with the SALT (Sealed and Lubricated Track), a permanently lubricated track system which was introduced on their track-type tractors in the early 1970s.|$|R
