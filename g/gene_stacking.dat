40|$|The {{combination}} or stacking {{of different}} traits or genes in plants is rapidly gaining popularity in biotech crop production. Here we review the existing terminology regarding <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> in plants, {{and its implications}} in relation to genetics, biosafety, detectability and European regulations. Different methods of production of stacked gene traits, {{as well as the}} status of their cultivation and approval, are reviewed. Related to the different techniques of transformation and production, including classical breeding, and to differences in global authorization and commercialization practices, there are many types, definitions, and perceptions of stacking. These include: (1) stacking of traits and (2) stacking of events, which are the most widely accepted perceptions of stacking, and (3) stacking of genes, which from the analytical and traceability point of view may be a more appropriate perception. These differences in perceptions and definitions are discussed, as are their implications for analytical detection and regulatory compliance according to (in particular) European Union (EU) regulations. A comprehensive terminology regarding <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> with regulatory relevance is proposed. The haploid genome equivalent is proposed as the prevailing unit of measurement at all stages throughout the chain, {{in order to ensure that}} terminology and definitions of gene stacks are adapted to analytical detection, traceability, and compliance with EU regulations...|$|E
40|$|Massive {{resistance}} (R) <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> {{is considered}} {{to be one of the}} most promising approaches to provide durable resistance to potato late blight for both conventional and genetically modified breeding strategies. The R 3 complex locus on chromosome XI in potato is an example of natural R <b>gene</b> <b>stacking,</b> because it contains two closely linked R genes (R 3 a and R 3 b) with distinct resistance specificities to Phytophthora infestans. Here, we report about the positional cloning of R 3 b. Both transient and stable transformations of susceptible tobacco and potato plants showed that R 3 b conferred full resistance to incompatible P infestans isolates. R 3 b encodes a coiled-coil nucleotide-binding site leucine-rich repeat protein and exhibits 82 % nucleotide identity with R 3 a located in the same R 3 cluster. The R 3 b gene specifically recognizes Avr 3 b, a newly identified avirulence factor from P. infestans. R 3 b does not recognize Avr 3 a, the corresponding avirulence gene for R 3 a, showing that, despite their high sequence similarity, R 3 b and R 3 a have clearly distinct recognition specificities. In addition to the Rpi-mcd 1 /Rpi-blb 3 locus on chromosome IV, the R 3 locus on chromosome XI is the second example of an R-gene cluster with multiple genes recognizing different races of P. infestans...|$|E

Although the <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> problem is proved to be NP-hard, we have been able to obtain Pareto frontiers for smaller sized instances within one minute using the state-of-the-art commercial computer solvers in our computational experiments. In the second paper, we presented an exact algorithm for the bilevel mixed integer linear programming (BMILP) problem under three simplifying assumptions. Compared to these existing ones, our new algorithm relies on weaker assumptions, explicitly considers infinite optimal, infeasible, and unbounded cases, and is proved to terminate infinitely with the correct output. We report results of our computational experiments on a small library of BMILP test instances, which we have created and made publicly available online. In the third paper, we presented the watermelon algorithm for the bilevel integer linear programming (BILP) problem. To our best knowledge, it is the first exact algorithm which promises to solve all possible BILPs, including finitely optimal, infeasible, and unbounded cases. What is more, our algorithm does not rely on any simplifying condition, allowing even the case of unboundedness for the high point problem. We prove that the watermelon algorithm must finitely terminate with the correct output. Computational experiments are also reported showing the efficiency of our algorithm...|$|E

40|$|Phytophthora infestans {{remains the}} most devastating potato {{pathogen}} worldwide. In developing countries it causes annual losses of up to 2. 75 billion USD, excluding the cost of pesticides. Host plant resistance mediated by single R genes has been rapidly overcome by P. infestans on many occasions. However, durable resistance might be achieved through genetic transformation of a potato variety with different combinations of R genes from Solanum wild species. The RB, Rpi-blb 2 (isolated from Solanum bulbocastanum) and the Rpi-vnt 1. 1 (isolated from S. venturii) genes are being transferred into the susceptible variety Desiree and other varieties grown in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Close to 600 transgenic events (TE) were produced from Desiree with either a single R gene (251) or the 3 R <b>gene</b> <b>stack</b> (331). TE {{with high levels of}} resistance to P. infestans were identified by in-vitro and whole-plant assays. Fewer than 10 % of the TE with either a single R gene or the 3 R <b>gene</b> <b>stack</b> were found to be highly resistant. A hypersensitive reaction to specific isolates and extreme resistance was observed for 7 out of 64 RB-TE, 4 out of 117 Rpi-blb 2 -TE, 1 out of 25 Rpi-vnt 1. 1 -TE, and 16 out of 162 3 R-TE. Varieties from SSA have been identified as candidates for transformation, with priority given to three: Shangi (rapidly increasing adoption in Kenya), Tigoni (well established variety in Kenya), and Cruza 148 (grown in the Lake Kivu region, especially in Burundi and Rwanda).

However, at present, multigene transformation {{is very difficult}} due to technical limitations of existing methods. Here, we describe a vector system for efficient multigene assembly and transformation. The system consists of a transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) -based acceptor vector together with two donor vectors. By exploiting the Cre/loxP recombination system and homing endonucleases, multiple rounds of gene assembly cycling were carried out with alternate use of the donor vectors, and multiple genes were sequentially delivered into the TAC vector. With this system, we created constructs containing as many as 10 foreign DNA fragments.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Crown gall (CG) (Agrobacterium tumefaciens) and {{the root}} lesion {{nematodes}} (RLNs) (Pratylenchus vulnus) are major {{challenges faced by}} the California walnut industry, reducing productivity and increasing the cost of establishing and maintaining orchards. Current nematode control strategies include nematicides, crop rotation, and tolerant cultivars, but these methods have limits. Developing genetic resistance through novel approaches like RNA interference (RNAi) can address these problems. RNAi-mediated silencing of CG disease in walnut (Juglans regia L.) has been achieved previously. We sought to place both CG and nematode resistance into a single walnut rootstock genotype using co-transformation to stack the resistance genes. A. tumefaciens, carrying self-complimentary iaaM and ipt transgenes, and Agrobacterium rhizogenes, carrying a self-complimentary Pv 010 gene from P. vulnus, were used as co-transformation vectors. RolABC genes were introduced by the resident T-DNA in the A. rhizogenes Ri-plasmid used as a vector for plant transformation. Pv 010 and Pv 194 (transgenic control) genes were also transferred separately using A. tumefaciens. To test for resistance, transformed walnut roots were challenged with P. vulnus and microshoots were challenged with a virulent strain of A. tumefaciens. 				 				 					 						Results 					Combining the two bacterial strains at a 1 : 1 rather than 1 : 3 ratio increased the co-transformation efficiency. Although complete immunity to nematode infection was not observed, transgenic lines yielded up to 79 % fewer nematodes per root following in vitro co-culture than untransformed controls. Transgenic line 33 - 3 - 1 exhibited complete crown gall control and 32 % fewer nematodes. The transgenic plants had thicker, longer roots than untransformed controls possibly due to insertion of rolABC genes. When the Pv 010 gene was present in roots with or without rolABC genes there was partial or complete control of RLNs. Transformation using only one vector showed 100 % control in some lines. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					CG and nematode resistance <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> controlled CG and RLNs simultaneously in walnuts. Silencing genes encoding iaaM, ipt, and Pv 010 decrease CG formation and RLNs populations in walnut. Beneficial plant genotype and phenotype changes are caused by co-transformation using A. tumefaciens and A. rhizogenes strains. Viable resistance against root lesion nematodes in walnut plants may be accomplished in the future using this <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> technology...|$|E

We followed this work by applying control analysis to light-induced fatty acid synthesis. This was the first such application to lipid synthesis in any organism. The data showed that acetyl-CoA carboxylase was very important, exerting about half of the total control.

To produce the high omega- 3 fatty acid and astaxanthin in soybean seed as a feedstock for aquaculture. Over expression of mangosteen stearoyl-ACP thioesterase gene increased stearic acid content up to 10 % to 15 %. The identified elevated stearic acid events were crossed with our high oleic acid/low palmitic acid event. Average stearic and oleic acid content ranged 14 to 19 % and 68 to 73 % respectively. Stearic acid content of elevated stearic acid soybean event and cross line was stable over generation. However, in generation six and seven under field conditions the oleate levels decreased to 30 – 40 %. ^ Decline of marine fish stocks due to over-fishing {{and the use of}} wild fish for diets of farmed fish pushed for development of sustainable land based alternative diets for farming fish such as soybean with respect to levels of very long chain omega- 3 fatty acids, EPA and DHA. To generate EPA and the high value carotenoid, astaxanthin in soybean, we first created a two <b>gene</b> <b>stack</b> in soybean combining Δ 6 and Δ 15 desaturase genes, respectively.

40|$|Maize (Zea mays L) is {{a staple}} food crop grown in South Africa by both large scale {{commercial}} and smallholder farmers. During the 2013 / 14 cropping season maize occupied about 2. 6 million hectares {{of the total}} 3. 9 million hectares of arable land that was under field crops in South Africa. Maize accounted for about 12. 4 million tonnes of the 14. 4 million tonnes of all field crops produced. Excessive competition from weeds is a major constraint, reducing maize yield and farmer income. Resource poor and inexperienced emerging farmers who have acquired land through the government land redistribution programmes are particularly affected.

Although emerging farmers have several options available for weed control, these {{still need to be}} appraised with regards to benefits, in the form of grain yield measured against the cost of weed management. An on-farm study was carried out at two sites in the North West province of South Africa during the 2011 / 12 and 2013 / 14 cropping seasons. The objectives were:- ? To determine the effect of different weed control methods on maize yields of emerging farmers at two localities in the North West province. ? To identify the most competitive or problematic weed species at two localities in the North West province. ? To compare the economic benefit of different weed control methods at the two localities. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot randomised block design. A <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> (stalk borer and herbicides resistance) and a conventional maize cultivar were planted in strips. Eight weed control methods that included hand-weeding, mechanical, chemical (herbicides) and combinations of these methods were randomly allocated across the strips. Weed species were counted and crop heights were recorded at three and eight weeks after crop emergence (WACE). Weed dry biomass was also determined. Grain yield and the yield components of ear mass and 100 kernels mass were recorded. A cost-benefit analysis of these weed control methods was carried out in the context of total production costs. The highest maize grain yields were obtained, where weed competitive effects were satisfactorily suppressed. The clean field and pre- and post-emergence herbicides methods produced the highest grain yields in the two seasons. In the first season the highest grain yields obtained were 73 % higher than the lowest yield in no-weeding method for both cultivars. The second season was characterized by below average and erratic rainfall. The <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivar outperformed the conventional cultivar by 63 % where weeds were effectively controlled. Weed competition seemed to cancel the superiority of the <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivar over the conventional cultivar in a drier season. The cost-benefit analysis revealed that a single cultivation operation at six WACE was the cheapest method, costing only R 495 ha- 1 irrespective of the cultivar used. Keeping a clean field throughout the season was the most costly endeavour, at R 2 528 ha- 1 and R 2 174 ha- 1 for the conventional and the <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivar respectively. The use of both pre- and post-emergence herbicides on <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivars can provide farmers with a return of up to R 2. 60 for every R 1 invested. Controlling weeds in a conventional maize cultivar, using tractor-drawn cultivator at six WACE, can give a return of up to R 1. 64 for every R 1 invested. The weed control methods that provide the highest grain yields are not necessarily the most cost effective. It is preliminarily recommended that chemical weed control methods be considered if <b>stacked</b> <b>gene</b> cultivars are to be planted. However, mechanical weed control methods must be considered when planting conventional cultivars. The present study needs to be intensified, covering a wider geographical extent, to cater for variation that can be expected as a result of differences in climate, soil type and weed spectra.

40|$|Genetic {{engineering}} is a scientific tool used in every {{field of science}} like plant, animal and human sciences. Plant genetic engineering technology has {{changed the face of}} plant sciences and the first generation of transgenic crops has become the most rapidly adopted technology in modern agriculture. But genetic engineering has some limitations and therefore still there is a clear need of new technologies to overcome issues like <b>gene</b> <b>stacking,</b> transgene position effects and insertion-site complexity. The recent strategy that researchers have developed to overcome those limitations is the development of plant artificial minichromosomes for delivery of large DNA sequences, including large genes, multigene complexes, or even complete metabolic pathways. A minichromosome is an extremely small version of a chromosome that have been produced by de novo construction using cloned components of chromosomes or through telomere-mediated truncation of endogenous chromosomes. After a successful experiment in maize with the help of minichromsomes by J. Birchler and colleagues (Yu et al., 2007 a), a new paradigm have been set for all the agricultural researchers to use the minichromosome techniques for crop improvement. Engineered minichromosomes also offer an enormous opportunity to improve crop performance, as discussed by Houben and Schubert (2007). With rapidly expanding research in minichromosome as a second generation genetic engineering tool we can hope that it will bring a new generation of improved crop species to meet the global demands...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{transformation}} with resistance (R) genes {{is expected}} to enhance resistance durability against pathogens, especially for potato, a vegetatively propagated crop with tetrasomic inheritance and a long-term breeding program. In this study, 128 potato transformants were analysed {{for the presence of}} vector T-DNA genes, borders and backbone sequences. They were harvested after transformation using a construct containing neomycin phosphotransferase II (nptII) and three R genes against potato late blight (Phytophthora infestans). Our analysis revealed that 45 % of the R gene-containing transformants possessed a low T-DNA copy number, without the integration of vector backbone and borders. The integration of vector backbone sequences was characterized using eight genes, and backbone gene tetA was selected for the early prediction of plants with backbone sequence integration. Three transformants, two plants harbouring one T-DNA copy and one plant harbouring three T-DNA copies, were crossed with susceptible cv. Katahdin. Based on our results, we conclude that all four T-DNA genes were inherited as one cluster and segregated in a Mendelian fashion. The three T-DNA inserts from the transformant harbouring three T-DNA copies were statistically proven to be un-linked and inherited into the offspring plants independently. All of the R genes were functionally expressed in the offspring plants as in their parental transformants. This functional <b>gene</b> <b>stacking</b> has important implications towards achieving more durable resistance against potato late bligh...|$|E
40|$|One {{strategy}} for delaying evolution {{of resistance to}} Bacillus thuringiensis crystal (Cry) endotoxins is the production of multiple Cry toxins in each transgenic plant (<b>gene</b> <b>stacking).</b> This strategy relies upon the assumption that simultaneous evolution of resistance to toxins that have different modes of action {{will be difficult for}} insect pests. In B. thuringiensis-transgenic (Bt) cotton, production of both Cry 1 Ac and Cry 2 Ab has been proposed to delay resistance of Heliothis virescens (tobacco budworm). After previous laboratory selection with Cry 1 Ac, H. virescens strains CXC and KCBhyb developed high levels of cross-resistance not only to toxins similar to Cry 1 Ac but also to Cry 2 Aa. We studied the role of toxin binding alteration in resistance and cross-resistance with the CXC and KCBhyb strains. In toxin binding experiments, Cry 1 A and Cry 2 Aa toxins bound to brush border membrane vesicles from CXC, but binding of Cry 1 Aa was reduced for the KCBhyb strain compared to susceptible insects. Since Cry 1 Aa and Cry 2 Aa do not share binding proteins in H. virescens, our results suggest occurrence of at least two mechanisms of resistance in KCBhyb insects, one of them related to reduction of Cry 1 Aa toxin binding. Cry 1 Ac bound irreversibly to brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) from YDK, CXC, and KCBhyb larvae, suggesting that Cry 1 Ac insertion was unaffected. These results highlight the genetic potential of H. virescens to become resistant to distinct Cry toxins simultaneously and may questio...|$|E
40|$|Site-specific and {{adaptable}} DNA binding domains {{are essential}} modules to develop genome engineering technologies for crop improvement. Transcription activator-like effectors (TALEs) proteins {{are used to}} provide a highly specific and adaptable DNA binding modules. TALE chimeric nucleases (TALENs) were used to generate site-specific double strand breaks (DSBs) in vitro and in yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans, mammalian and plant cells. The genomic DSBs can be generated at predefined and user-selected loci and repaired by either the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology dependent repair (HDR). Thus, TALENs {{can be used to}} achieve site-specific <b>gene</b> addition, <b>stacking,</b> deletion or inactivation. TALE-based genome engineering tools should be powerful to develop new agricultural biotechnology approaches for crop improvement.

40|$|Hybrid maize (Zea mays L.) through transgenics now {{includes}} δ-endotoxins for insect control and tolerance to the herbicides glyphosate and glufosinate. Some hybrids have multiple transgenic traits {{as part of}} their genotype (<b>stacked</b> <b>gene).</b> Limited information is available on how these traits alone affect A (net assimilation rate; µmol CO 2 m− 2 s− 1) and related physiological parameters. A two-year, two-location, irrigated experiment comparing four <b>stacked</b> <b>gene,</b> four glyphosate tolerant, and two non-GMO hybrids for ear leaf A, gs (stomatal conductance; mol H 2 O m− 2 s− 1), Em (transpiration; mol H 2 O m− 2 s− 1), IWUE (intrinsic water use efficiency; (A/(gs* 100))), and Ci (intercellular [CO 2] µmol CO 2 mol air− 1) was completed at Stoneville, MS, in 2012.

40|$|From 2006 through 2015, a {{research}} project on Durable Resistance in potato against Phytophthora (DuRPh) was carried out at Wageningen University and Research Centre. Its objective {{was to develop a}} proof of principle for durable resistance against late blight by cisgenesis. This public-funded project aimed at stimulating research on genetic modification and public debate on innovative genetic techniques. It was decided to clone and transfer late blight resistance (R) genes of crossable wild potato species (cisgenes) by Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation without non-potato <b>genes.</b> A <b>stack</b> of multiple R genes were planned to be inserted into established varieties, thereby creating a dynamic variety in which the composition of the stacks may vary over space and time. Cisgenic plants were selected based on the expression of all inserted R genes and trueness-to-type. Within the project, 13 R genes from wild potato species were genetically mapped and three of them were cloned. Four varieties were transformed with one to three R genes. This was initially done using kanamycin resistance provided by a selectable marker gene of synthetic origin in order to quickly test the performance and stability of the introduced R <b>genes</b> and <b>stacked</b> R <b>gene</b> combinations. Once the functioning thereof was confirmed, marker-free transformations were conducted; thus, true cisgenic events were selected. The results about the different R genes, their chromosomal location, their specificity, the background dependence, the maximum size of a stack, its regeneration time and associated somaclonal variation frequency and its stability were studied. After selection and characterisation in the laboratory, the best cisgenic events were assessed in field trials for late blight resistance. This showed that inserted R genes were capable of turning a susceptible variety into a resistant one. Maximising longevity of the resistance was assured through resistance management research. It was shown that stacking of multiple R genes and monitoring how to deploy these stacks spatially and temporally could reduce fungicide use by over 80 %. Communications through media and field demonstrations were manifold to allow public and policymakers to decide if cisgenesis is an acceptable tool to make potato farming more sustainable. Future deployment of the DuRPh strategy will depend largely on its status as a genetically modified crop or its exemption thereof. Worldwide near eradication of late blight would increase global annual potato production by close to 80 million tons, thereby contributing considerably to the needed additional global future food supply. </p...|$|R
