Using a cued-recall paradigm, Study 1 examines whether SCIs occur and Study 2 allows for a comparison between implicitly inferred and explicitly mentioned causes. Study 3 examines whether SCIs can be fully {{explained in terms of}} spreading activation to general, abstract schemes.

40|$|No-take marine {{reserves}} {{are expected to}} enhance coral reef resilience indirectly through suppression of algal growth and thus maintenance of coral dominance. The mechanism of such enhancement is protection of functionally important herbivorous fishes from harvest. We provide indirect (<b>inferred)</b> evidence of <b>reserves</b> performing this role. We used data on herbivorous fishes, macroalgae and corals collected {{at one point in}} time in 15 reserves (range of duration of protection: 0. 5 to 11 yr) and at 15 fished sites in the Philippines. Results inferred a 9 - and 15 -fold increase in density and biomass, respectively, of herbivorous fishes, which coincided with a 13 -fold decrease in macroalgal cover inside reserves after 11 yr of protection. The inferred decline in macroalgal cover was more rapid during the first 5 yr of protection. No significant trends in fish abundance or macroalgal cover were detected among fished sites. Biomass of herbivorous fishes was 8 times higher, and cover of macroalgae 25 times lower, on average, inside older (8 to 11 yr) reserves than at fished sites. Parrotfishes (Scaridae) and surgeonfishes (Acanthuridae) had markedly different inferred trajectories of population recovery. Recovery of parrotfish was more rapid than that of surgeonfish in the first 5 yr of protection, suggesting that the functional role of parrotfish was important in reducing macroalgal cover. The inferred relationships of hard coral cover with duration of reserve protection and with herbivore biomass were non-significant. Even at fished sites, coral cover (mostly > 25 %) was much higher than macrolgal cover (mostly < 15 %). Thus, {{there was no evidence that}} the current levels of fishing of herbivores on these reefs have led to ‘benthic phase shifts’...|$|R

Quantitative and narrative records are used to <b>infer</b> the Federal <b>Reserve’s</b> intentions for the federal funds rate around FOMC meetings. This series is regressed on the Federal Reserve’s internal forecasts to derive a measure free of systematic responses to information about future developments. Estimates using the new measure indicate that policy has large, relatively rapid, and statistically significant effects on both output and inflation. The effects are substantially stronger and quicker than those obtained using conventional indicators. (JEL E 52, E 58, E 32, E 31) The accuracy of estimates {{of the effects of}} monetary policy depends crucially on the validity of the measure of monetary policy that is used. Use of an inappropriate measure may obscure a relationship between monetary policy and other economic variables that actually exists, or create the appearance of a relationship where there is no true causal link. For this reason, this paper derives a new measure of monetary policy shocks that is free from some key deficiencies of previous measures. The new measure yields estimates of the impact of monetary policy on both real and nominal variables that are stronger and faster than those obtained using conventional indicators. Conventional measures of monetary policy have some obvious flaws. One is the likelihood of endogenous movements. The money supply, for example, tends to rise in good times because the money multiplier rises. Even the federal funds rate, which has become the standard indicator of monetary actions in studies of the effects of monetary policy, moves a great dea...|$|R

The No. II 1 coal seam has stronger adsorption, and the reservoir natural permeability has all evident heterogeneity vary from 0. 0001 to 83. 71 mD. High permeability region is often near fault structure or the boundary of fault block. The CBM genetic type is homologous thermal cracking gas of humic coal with high matunity.
