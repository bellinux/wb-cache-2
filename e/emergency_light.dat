5|$|Emergency lights may be {{housed in}} special fittings, {{such as in}} a lightbar, or may be hidden in a host light (such as a headlamp) by {{drilling}} {{a hole in the}} host light's reflector and inserting the <b>emergency</b> <b>light.</b> These hidden lights may not be apparent until they are activated. Additionally, some of the standard lights fitted to an ambulance (e.g. headlamps, tail lamps) may be programmed to flash. Flashing headlights (typically the high beams, flashed alternately) are known as a wig-wag.|$|E
25|$|Police {{used to have}} blue-colored {{emergency}} lights {{but after}} a recent restock of vehicles, now the use of both blue and red color is usual. Fire Departments make use of red only <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> while ambulances either use red or both colors. Regulation also states that the Military as well as vehicles carrying politicians can make use of a single rotating blue light at the roof. Every other individual and/or company may use yellow lights for either warning or emergency. Special groups like Emergency Response teams and agents may also include emergency lights on their private vehicles {{in case of an}} emergency when not in active duty. All utility vehicles such as construction related, tow trucks must be equipped with a yellow-colored <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> bar on the top, clearly visible from the front and rear side. The same applies for private security firm vehicles, that are in generally treated like typical private cars.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{the blue}} <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> {{originates}} in Germany during World War II. As {{a result of the}} ‘Verdunkelung’, a measure for aerial defense from 1935, cobalt blue was regulated to replace the red color used until 1938 in emergency vehicle lights. Due to the scattering properties of the blue color, it is only visible to lower altitudes and is therefore less easily spotted by enemy airplanes.|$|E

The sale of a blue <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> is permitted, however, the possession of such a light in vehicles (whether turned on or off, visible or not) is strictly illegal. Red lights are used by {{the first and last}} vehicle of a convoy of designated vehicles and also are strictly regulated. Amber lights are seeing increasing popularity in recent years, however, specific uses are designated according to the Polish ‘Kodeks Drogowy’. There are no specific rules governing the use of other colors such as purple, green, or clear lights.|$|E
500|$|The Marmon-Herrington Combat Tank Light Series were {{a series}} of American light tanks/tankettes that were {{produced}} for the export market {{at the start of}} the Second World War. The CTL-3 had a crew of two and was armed with two [...]30cal (7.62mm) M1919 machine guns and one [...]50 cal (12.7mm) M2 Browning machine gun. They were originally designed to be amphibious light tanks. They were rejected by the U.S. Marine Corps in 1939, but after the attack on Pearl Harbor they were exported and used as an <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> tank.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1991 model year, by {{governmental}} disposition, the Volkswagen Beetle featured {{from now}} on a catalytic converter; however, it kept its carburetor, its electrical system with a generator and the old ignition system. [...] These changes did not affect its power and performance. In the passenger compartment, the dashboard received new light and <b>emergency</b> <b>light</b> switches, {{as well as a}} new two-arm steering wheel. Those elements came from the design of the Golf. In addition, the Volkswagen Beetle had now a new alarm system as series equipment. Externally, this model differed due to the rear apron of its central body, which was now more rounded. The function of this feature was to allow more space in accommodating the new catalytic converter within the engine compartment. The exhaust system also had only a single tailpipe, in contrast to the two tailpipes shown in the previous models.|$|E

The latter type of revolver was the kind typically carried by New York City Police Department detectives of that era. Kojak usually carried it in the front right pocket of his overcoat or suit jacket, or he carried it in his hand as he approached a scene where he was expecting danger. This became known as carrying a weapon [...] "Kojak Style" [...] or as the [...] "Kojak Carry" [...] by police.|$|E

40|$|The {{issue of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> is quite {{complicated}} and meeting all standard requirements are often very complex. Rapid {{development in the}} field of LED light sources has brought new possibilities in the design of <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting.</b> In particular, LED has a higher power output in comparison to conventional light sources used in <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting</b> and also the size of LED is smaller. Another advantage is the possibility of optimal routing of LED diodes by means of suitable optics depending on the areas and the type of <b>emergency</b> <b>lighting.</b> Measurements were performed on a prototype of autonomous emergency lamp, which does not use a conventional battery as a source of energy, but super-capacitor. Especially {{from the perspective of a}} long lifespan, its fast charging and reducing of dependence on temperature, the super-capacitor seems like very reliable replacement of batteries previously used...|$|R
