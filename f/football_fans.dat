Red Issue issued pamphlets to fans and demonstrations in and around Old Trafford took place before the match against Charlton Athletic on 9 September. <b>Football</b> <b>fans</b> across the United Kingdom also lent support by lobbying their local MPs into passing a legislation, preventing further sport takeovers in the future.|$|E
5|$|Atlético de Kolkata, and the ISL in general, were {{initially}} announced with a mixed reception among <b>football</b> <b>fans</b> in Kolkata. Some locals feared {{that it could}} overshadow the development of players at the city's two long-established I-League clubs, while others saw the new franchise {{as a way to}} unite both sets of I-League supporters, who would be drawn together further by the involvement of Ganguly, who is idolised across the state.|$|E
5|$|Birmingham fans {{consider}} their main rivals to be Aston Villa, their nearest neighbours geographically, {{with whom they}} contest the Second City derby. Lesser rivalries exist with fellow West Midlands clubs Wolverhampton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion. According to a 2003 <b>Football</b> <b>Fans</b> Census survey, Aston Villa fans thought of Birmingham City as their main rivals, though this was not always the case.|$|E

5|$|In the 2000s, {{supporter}} {{culture in}} Sweden started {{to shift from}} being English-influenced to being more influenced by the Southern European countries and their football culture, making tifos and ultras a common sight in Swedish arenas. From acting as an almost uniform group of fans gathered under the same flag, (Änglarna), IFK fans created separate supporter factions, including Ultra Bulldogs, Young Lions and West Coast Angelz. IFK {{is the most popular}} football club in Sweden; a 2004 survey concluded that IFK Göteborg had support from 13% of Swedish <b>football</b> <b>fans,</b> and a 2017 survey again stated that IFK was the most popular club in Sweden, with a support of 10%. A majority, 55%, of <b>football</b> <b>fans</b> in Gothenburg support IFK, and the club is the fourth most popular in Stockholm (after AIK, Djurgårdens IF and Hammarby IF) and the second most popular in Malmö, after Malmö FF.|$|E

5|$|The Oval {{is located}} near the Port of Belfast, and Harland and Wolff's Samson and Goliath cranes are visible from inside the stadium. It {{is viewed as a}} {{historic}} ground by <b>football</b> <b>fans</b> because of its concrete terraces and steel fencing. This limits its capacity in UEFA-sanctioned matches to the 3,000 seats in the two main stands as terracing has not been permitted in UEFA matches since 1998.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal's longest-running and deepest rivalry is {{with their}} nearest major neighbours, Tottenham Hotspur; matches {{between the two}} are {{referred}} to as North London derbies. Other rivalries within London include those with Chelsea, Fulham and West Ham United. In addition, Arsenal and Manchester United developed a strong on-pitch rivalry in the late 1980s, which intensified in recent years when both clubs were competing for the Premier League title– so much so that a 2003 online poll by the <b>Football</b> <b>Fans</b> Census listed Manchester United as Arsenal's biggest rivals, followed by Tottenham and Chelsea. A 2008 poll listed the Tottenham rivalry as more important.|$|E

5|$|Barça's local rival {{has always}} been Espanyol. Blanc-i-blaus, {{being one of the}} clubs granted royal patronage, was founded {{exclusively}} by Spanish <b>football</b> <b>fans,</b> unlike the multinational nature of Barça's primary board. The founding message of the club was clearly anti-Barcelona, and they disapprovingly saw FC Barcelona as a team of foreigners. The rivalry was strengthened by what Catalonians saw as a provocative representative of Madrid. Their original ground was in the affluent district of Sarrià.|$|E
5|$|Even {{before the}} animal cruelty case {{surfaced}} in 2007, however, Vick's corporate status had deteriorated. Among the negative incidents was his middle finger gesture to Atlanta <b>football</b> <b>fans</b> in 2006. Vick's first endorsement after {{being released from}} prison was a two-year deal on January 27, 2011 with Unequal Technologies, a company that produces football pads. Nike officially signed Vick again as an athlete on July 1, 2011. The company had been supplying him with complimentary gear since October 2009; his re-signing {{marked the first time}} a sponsor had brought back an athlete after dropping him.|$|E

5|$|Further afield, {{the club}} has a rivalry with Bristol City, known as the Severnside derby, {{and to a lesser}} extent, Bristol Rovers. There is also a lesser rivalry with Welsh {{neighbours}} Newport County due to the proximity of the two Welsh cities. However, they have rarely played against each another since the 1980s due to Cardiff being in higher leagues. In total they have only ever played 20 football league games against each other. A survey by <b>Football</b> <b>Fans</b> Census in 2003 saw Swansea, Bristol City and Newport listed as Cardiff's main three rivalries, with Stoke City matching Newport in third.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, the team's six home matches had {{an average}} {{attendance}} of 22,753. In a survey of German <b>football</b> <b>fans,</b> 65percent of the male and 62percent of the female respondents said {{they were interested in}} women's football. However, this popularity is mostly limited to international matches. Although the number of spectators in the women's Bundesliga has more than doubled since 2003, the average attendance in the 2007–08 season (887) was still less than three percent of that of the men's Bundesliga (38,612).|$|E

5|$|FITs {{were first}} {{formed in the}} early 1990s, {{as part of the}} Public Order Intelligence Unit (CO11), a section of the Public Order Branch of the Metropolitan Police. They {{initially}} targeted <b>football</b> <b>fans,</b> hunt saboteurs and political protesters (since at least 1996), using cameras, camcorders and audio recorders to conduct overt surveillance of the public. The police officers wear full uniform, and are intended to be a highly visible presence. Their uniform is sometimes different from normal police officers in that the upper half of their yellow fluorescent jackets is blue. Civilian photographers are also employed by the police to work alongside FITs. According to Scotland Yard, the aim of FIT teams at protests is to record evidence of protesters in case disorder occurs later on at a protest.|$|E
5|$|The 2003 <b>Football</b> <b>Fans</b> Census {{revealed}} {{that no other}} team's supporters considered York to be among their club's main rivals. Traditionally, York's two main rivalries have been with Hull City and Scarborough. While York fans saw Hull as their main rival, this was not reciprocated by the East Yorkshire club, who saw Leeds United as their main rival. York also had a rivalry with Halifax Town {{and they were the}} team most local to York when the two played in the Conference. A rivalry with Luton Town developed during the club's final years in the Conference as both clubs met regularly in crucial matches, accompanied by a series of contentious incidents involving crowd trouble, contentious transfers and complaints about the behaviour of directors.|$|E
5|$|The club's first {{match in}} the Yugoslav top {{division}} was played in 1967 against Vardar in Skopje (1–1); Maras scored the only goal for Maribor. The first top level home match was played on 27 August 1967 against Proleter Zrenjanin {{in front of}} 8,000 spectators and Maribor won with the score 3–0. The goals were scored by Kranjc, Arnejčič and Binkovski. During the same season, <b>football</b> <b>fans</b> across Slovenia witnessed the first ever match in the Yugoslav top flight involving two clubs from Slovenia, when Maribor hosted a match against their rivals Olimpija in front of 13,000spectators (0–0). Every match between the two clubs during this period would be sold out, with crowd attendance sometimes as high as 20,000.
