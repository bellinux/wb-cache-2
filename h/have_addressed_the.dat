5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, {{if they ever}} existed. The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer. Though it is unclear {{if this was a}} true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it did not lead to Poe's death a year later.|$|E
5|$|There {{are various}} {{competing}} theories that <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> early colonisation process, {{although it is}} clear that the Northern Isles were the first to be conquered by Vikings and the last to be relinquished by the Norwegian crown. Thorfinn Sigurdsson's rule in the 11th century included expansion well into north mainland Scotland and this may have been the zenith of Scandinavian influence. The obliteration of pre-Norse names in the Hebrides and Northern Isles, and their replacement with Norse ones was almost total although the emergence of alliances with the native Gaelic speakers produced a powerful Norse-Gael culture that had wide influence in Argyll, Galloway and beyond.|$|E

25|$|O gauge had {{its heyday}} when model railroads were {{considered}} toys, with more {{emphasis placed on}} cost, durability, {{and the ability to}} be easily handled and operated by pre-adult hands. Detail and realism were secondary concerns, at best. It still remains a popular choice for those hobbyists who enjoy running trains more than they enjoy other aspects of modeling, but developments in recent years <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> concerns of scale model railroaders making O scale popular among fine-scale modellers who value the detail that can be achieved.|$|E

25|$|Compatibilists {{maintain}} that mental reality {{is not of}} itself causally effective. Classical compatibilists <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> dilemma of free will by arguing that free will holds {{as long as we}} are not externally constrained or coerced. Modern compatibilists make a distinction between freedom of will and freedom of action, that is, separating freedom of choice from the freedom to enact it. Given that humans all experience a sense of free will, some modern compatibilists think it is necessary to accommodate this intuition. Compatibilists often associate freedom of will with the ability to make rational decisions.|$|E
25|$|In addition, {{concerned}} parties <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> {{crisis on}} several science and ecological websites. Organizations {{such as the}} World Wide Fund for Nature, the African Wildlife Foundation, and others, are trying {{to focus attention on}} the extreme risk to the species. Some have suggested that a reserve be established in a more stable part of Africa, or on an island in a place such as Indonesia. Awareness is ever increasing, and even nonscientific or ecological sites have created various groups to collect donations to help with the conservation of this species.|$|E
25|$|CPT for {{geotechnical}} applications was standardized in 1986 by ASTM Standard D 3441 (ASTM, 2004). ISSMGE provides {{international standards}} on CPT and CPTU. Later ASTM Standards <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> use of CPT for various environmental site characterization and groundwater monitoring activities. For geotechnical soil investigations, CPT is more popular compared to SPT {{as a method}} of geotechnical soil investigation. Its increased accuracy, speed of deployment, more continuous soil profile and reduced cost over other soil testing methods. The ability to advance additional in situ testing tools using the CPT direct push drilling rig, including the seismic tools described above, are accelerating this process.|$|E

25|$|Numerous studies <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> geochemical {{signature}} of the lavas present on Iceland and in the north Atlantic. The resulting picture is consistent in several important respects. For instance, it is not contested {{that the source of}} the volcanism in the mantle is chemically and petrologically heterogeneous: it contains not only normal peridotite, but also eclogite – a fertile rock originating from subducted slabs – both of which contribute to the melts. The origin of the latter is assumed to be metamorphosed, very old oceanic crust which sank into the mantle several hundreds of millions of years ago during the subduction of an ocean, then upwelled from deep within the mantle.|$|E
25|$|Few nations <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> use of lockouts during whipsaw strikes, however. In the United States, the Supreme Court {{has ruled}} on the {{legality}} of the practice. The question before the Court was whether a lockout during a whipsaw strike was an unfair labor practice (ULP) under the National Labor Relations Act and its various amendments. In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Local 449 ("Buffalo Linen Supply Co."), 353 U.S. 87 (1957), the Court held that such a lockout was not a ULP. The high court further extended this ruling in NLRB v. Brown Food Stores, 380 U.S. 278 (1965), holding that an employer could engage in a partial lockout of its employees in advance of a whipsaw strike so long as the employer only utilized temporary replacements and locked out all workers (not just those who supported the union).|$|E
25|$|The University of Montana Law Review {{published}} three articles {{addressing this}} topic in its winter 2007 issue. David K. DeWolf, John G. West and Casey Luskin, senior fellows or {{officers of the}} Discovery Institute, argued that intelligent design is a valid scientific theory, that the Jones court should not <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> {{question of whether it}} was a scientific theory, and that the decision will have no effect on the development and adoption of intelligent design as an alternative to standard evolutionary theory. Peter Irons responded to the DeWolf et al. article, arguing that the decision was extremely well reasoned, and that it marks the end to legal efforts by the intelligent design movement to introduce creationism in public schools. It had been {{an essential part of the}} ruling to consider whether ID was a legitimate scientific theory as claimed by its proponents, and DeWolf, et al. had implicitly recognised this by citing the Lemon test, which would have been irrelevant if ID were legitimate science. DeWolf et al. responded to the Irons article in the same issue.|$|E

25|$|Court {{cases in}} recent years <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> {{legality}} of Taser use by police officers. In Bryan v. MacPherson, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a Taser {{had been used in}} a way that constituted excessive force and hence a violation of the Fourth Amendment. In the latter case Mattos v. Agarano, the same Court of Appeals found that in two situations involving Taser use, one in Drive Stun and one in dart mode, officers had used excessive force. According to an article in Police Chief magazine, this decision implies guidelines for the use of Tasers and other Electronic Control Devices in gaining compliance (in a setting where safety is not an issue), including that the officer must give warning before each application, and that the suspect must be capable of compliance, with enough time to consider a warning, and to recover from the extreme pain of any prior application of the Taser; and that Tasers must not be used on children, the elderly, and women who are visibly pregnant or inform the officer of their pregnancy.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{upgrades}} over {{a recent}} eighteen-month interval <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> life safety issues, including {{replacement of the}} football players' facilities, and an extensive seismic retrofit of those sections not subject to fault shearing. The work {{was the subject of}} several lawsuits from neighborhood and environmental groups, who were concerned about such extensive construction on top of a major fault. During the reconstruction, the Cal Bears have played at AT Park in San Francisco for one season. The modifications completed in Summer 2012 involved the cutting of the stadium into four independent sections, followed by the demolition of the two segments directly over the rubble zone. The north and south ends are formed of new bridging sections that rest upon floating mats (foundations that do not penetrate the surface, rather sitting upon plastic sheets over level graded gravel and sand) where they pass over and near the fault, with appropriate sliding connections between the sections for the safety of spectators and the ability to absorb the relative rotation between the east and west fixed sections and the new north and south mobile sections.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the vast}} {{majority}} of states have yet to determine the applicability of the trespass to chattels theory, the courts that <b>have</b> <b>addressed</b> <b>the</b> issue have applied Intel and required that the plaintiff demonstrate damage to the computer system. A supreme court in New York in School of Visual Arts v. Kuprewicz denied the defendant's motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on the trespass to chattels claim because the plaintiff had alleged actual damage to the functionality of the computer system, which Intel requires; the defendant had sent enough e-mails that it reduced the computer system's functionality and drained the hard drive's memory. The Fourth Circuit in Omega World Travel v. Mummagraphics, Inc. also followed Intel, although this resulted in granting a motion for summary judgment for the defendant because the plaintiff did not allege any actual damage on its computer system. The court clarified that Oklahoma courts have yet to recognize the validity of a trespass to chattels claim based on an electronic intrusion to a computer system, but if it were to recognize it, the plaintiff would need to allege more than nominal damages, which in this case it had not.|$|E
