The isoelectric point for human CCDC42B is 7.01, in which CCDC42B protein carries no net charge at that particular pH. The N-terminal of the protein sequence {{is composed of}} Met (M). The <b>grand</b> <b>average</b> of hydropathicity was predicted to be -0.694 for CCDC42B (Human) and -0.398 for Drosophila melanogaster CG10750, distantly related orthologs. The negative GRAVY confirms that both proteins are soluble and hydrophilic. The theoretical instability index (II) for CCDC42B is predicted to be 63.73 and for CG10750 is 45.20, which indicate that, both proteins are instable in a test tube. The half-life of is predicted to be 30 hours for both CCDC42B and CG10750 in mammalian reticulocytes (in vitro), which correspond to half-life for enzymes responsible for controlling metabolic rate. The above results confirmed that both CCDC42B and CG10750 share similarities in amino acid composition and protein characteristics. Thus, many characteristics of CCDC42B have been conserved across closely and distantly related species.|$|E

However, studies of long-latency auditory ERPs in children with SLI have generated inconsistent findings. A possible reason for this inconsistency is the heterogeneity of SLI.

We used this method to reanalyse auditory ERPs from a sample previously described by Uwer, Albrecht and von Suchodoletz (2002).

In the present study, we intended to determine whether these slow potentials would indicate some abnormality (topographic) in schizophrenic patients, and thus serve {{as an indication of}} abnormal association cortex activity. We recorded slow potentials while subjects performed a paired-associates memory task. A 123 -channel EEG montage and common average reference were used for 20 unmedicated schizophrenic (mean duration of illness: 11. 3 ± 9. 2 years; mean number of previous hospitalizations: 1. 2 ± 1. 9) and 22 healthy control subjects during a visual paired-associates matching task. For the topographic analysis, we used a simple index of individual topographic deviation from normality, corrected for absolute potential intensities. Slow potentials were observed in all subjects. Control subjects showed a simple spatial pattern of voltage extrema (left central positive and right prefrontal negative), whereas schizophrenic patients presented a more complex, fragmented pattern. Topographic deviation was significantly different between groups (P < 0. 001). The increased topographic complexity in schizophrenics could be visualized in <b>grand</b> <b>averages</b> computed across subjects. Increased topographic complexity could also be seen when <b>grand</b> <b>averages</b> were computed for subgroups of patients assembled either according to task-performance (high versus low) or by their scores on psychopathological scales.

40|$|A {{technique}} {{for the construction}} of exaggerated human movements was developed and its effectiveness tested for the case of categorising tennis serves as flat, slice, or topspin. The technique involves treating movements as points in a high-dimensional space and uses average movements as the basis for constructing exaggerated movements. Exaggerated movements of a particular style are defined as those points in the space of movements which lie on a line originating at the style average and in the direction defined by the difference between the style average and the <b>grand</b> <b>average.</b> In order to visualise the movements, computer animation techniques were employed to transform the three-dimensional coordinates of the movement into the motion of a solid-body figure.
