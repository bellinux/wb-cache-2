40|$|This paper {{presents}} a non-contact measurement of irradiance on plane of array (POA) and cell temperature for PV systems. The idea is motivated from the diode model of PV, where POA irradiance and cell temperature are {{proportional to the}} photocurrent and modified ideality factor, respectively. Based on the recent progress of diode model identification, the photocurrent and modified ideality factor can be linearly determined from I-V characteristics, which makes it feasible to develop a non-contact measurement approach for POA irradiance and cell temperature, i. e., both {{of them will be}} derived completely from the diode mode parameter identification without the need of any sensors. The calibration of the proportional factors is done from the <b>indoor</b> <b>module</b> flash test and then applied to outdoor module testbed to show the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed method...|$|E

40|$|There is a {{significant}} amount of research into the area of wireless communication in both the Indoor and Outdoor scenarios. One of the problems for small cells caused by many localised obstacles between and around the wireless communications components which reflect, scatter and diffract the wireless signal is the known phenomenon of multi-path. Currently, there are very few publicly available simulations that cater for this type of simulation. A project undertaken as a postgraduate thesis in 2002 attempted to develop a simulation using basic Simulink modules to create a block which would provide the ability to simulate different environments for simple indoor scenarios. More elaborate simulation packages exist, such as SIRCIM (Rappaport and Seidel) and SMRCIM (Huang) from the USA, but these typically cost thousands of dollars to purchase. This project was started with the concept of having freely available modules that are tested and known and can be used by others in the research and teaching community to test out different communication technologies. This paper outlines the initial stages of this longer term project, providing its current limitations and future possibilities for planned extensions and focuses only on the <b>indoor</b> <b>modules</b> developed. 1...|$|R

40|$|Arti®cial neural {{networks}} (ANN's) {{are more and}} more widely used in energy management processes. ANN's can be very useful in optimizing the energy demand of buildings, especially of those of high thermal inertia. These include the so-called solar buildings. For those buildings, a controller able to forecast not only the energy demand but also the weather conditions can lead to energy savings while maintaining thermal comfort. In this paper, such an ANN controller is proposed. It consists of a meteorological module, forecasting the ambient temperature and solar irradiance, the heating energy switch predictor <b>module</b> and the <b>indoor</b> temperature-de®ning <b>module.</b> The performance of the controller has been tested both experimentally and in a building thermal simulation environment.

40|$|This paper realizes {{automatically}} the navigating elements {{defined by}} indoorGML data standard – door, stairway and wall. The data used is indoor 3 D point cloud collected by Kinect v 2 launched in 2011 through {{the means of}} ORB-SLAM. By contrast, it is cheaper and more convenient than lidar, but the point clouds also have the problem of noise, registration error and large data volume. Hence, we adopt a shape descriptor – histogram of distances between two randomly chosen points, proposed by Osada and merges with other descriptor – in conjunction with random forest classifier to recognize the navigation elements (door, stairway and wall) from Kinect point clouds. This research acquires navigation elements and their 3 -d location information from each single data frame through segmentation of point clouds, boundary extraction, feature calculation and classification. Finally, this paper utilizes the acquired navigation elements and their information to generate the state data of the <b>indoor</b> navigation <b>module</b> automatically.

The paper focuses on the localization capabilities of the machine in several sensor setups with emphasis on the use of ultra wideband (UWB) real-time localization system (RTLS). It also proposes fusion of sensor data from several sources including novel use of wheel encoder’s data in UWB setup. Analysis is performed in terms of localization accuracy and reliability as well as associated advantages and disadvantages. Obtained results demonstrated that inclusion of UWB subsystem, despite its price and accuracy (20 cm in ideal, line of sight, conditions), based on behavior switching yields more reliable and accurate results in open spaces (up to 25 times in position and 2 times in orientation) and that its accuracy can be further improved with inclusion of wheel encoder data...|$|R

40|$|Nominal power {{measurements}} of individual PV modules {{are needed to}} quantify the critical modules of PV plants offering lower energy production than expected. Today’s {{state of the art}} procedure of shipping a small number of modules to a laboratory is time- and cost intensive and it bears the chance of accidental damage. The Portable LED Flasher (PLF) was developed to require no dismounting of the modules. The quality of the PLF was tested on three PV plants in Switzerland. Additionally, ten PV modules of each plant were measured in the certified indoor laboratory of SUPSI, resulting in a maximum deviation of 3 % of the STC values. Furthermore, a round robin test on a single crystalline silicon reference module at 25 °C was performed at the JRC’s ESTI laboratory, the Swiss Mobile Flasher Bus and SUPSI resulting in a maximum deviation of the mean values below 1 % compared to the PLF. A throughput of up to 150 modules or 500 modules respectively per day is expected and the total measurement costs are estimated to be about a tenth of the costs compared to an <b>indoor</b> laboratory. <b>Module</b> temperature measurement is crucial for a low total uncertainty. Thus, methods such as pre-shadowing of the module and approximation of cell temperature are the current focus of further improvement of the PLF measurement method...|$|R

Due to size and complexity of these buildings, people need guidance {{to find their way}} to the destination in these buildings. In this study, a mobile application is developed to visualize pedestrian's indoor position as 3 D in their smartphone and RFID Technology is used to detect the position of pedestrian. While the pedestrian is walking on his/her way on the route, smartphone will guide the pedestrian by displaying the photos of indoor environment on the route. Along the tour, an RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) device is integrated to the system. The pedestrian will carry the RFID device during his/her tour in the building. The RFID device will send the position data to the server directly in every two seconds periodically. On the other side, the pedestrian will just select the destination point in the mobile application on smartphone and sent the destination point to the server. The shortest path from the pedestrian position to the destination point is found out by the script on the server.

Module 1, with a device efficiency of 2. 5 % on an active area of 88 cm 2, demonstrates the up scaling of small area cells to larger area modules. Module 2, with a device efficiency of 1. 8 % and 106. 4 V on an active area of 32. 6 cm 2, demonstrates high voltage on a small area. Module 3, with a device efficiency of 2 % on an active area of 60. 8 cm 2 with a hexagonal layout, demonstrates the flexibility in module layout.

40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} a growing {{interest}} for vegetables production in indoor or disadvantaged climatic zones by using greenhouses. The main problem of crop growing indoor or in environment with limited light availability is the correct choice of light source and the quality of lighting spectrum. In greenhouse and indoor cultivations, plant density is higher than in the open field and plants have to compete for light and nutrients. Nowadays, advanced systems for indoor horticulture use light emitting diodes (LED) for improving crop growth, enhancing the plant productivity and favouring the best nutritional quality formation. In closed environments, as <b>indoor</b> growing <b>modules,</b> the lighting system represents the only source of light and its features are fundamental for obtaining the best lighting performances for plant and the most efficient solution. LED lighting engines are more efficient compared to the lighting sources used traditionally in horticulture and allow light spectrum and intensity modulations to enhance the light use efficiency for plants. The lighting distribution and the digital controls are fundamental for tailoring the spectral distribution on each plant in specific moments of its growth and play an important role for optimizing growth and produce high-quality vegetables. LED lights can increase plant growth and yield, but also nutraceutical quality, since some light intensities increase pigments biosynthesis and enhance the antioxidants content of leaves or fruits: in this regards the selection of LED primary light sources in relation to the peaks of the absorbance curve of the plants is important...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} energy and light {{performance}} assessment of two configurations of an Active Transparent Façade (ATF), which are investigated {{by means of}} an experimental campaign that makes use of a full-scale mock-up room of an office building. The two configurations of the ATF (a Climate Façade integrated with the HVAC system) differ in the technology of the inner glazing (extra-clear single glass or double pane glazing with low-e coating), while share all the other features - i. e. external glazing, shading system, airflow path and ventilation rate, control strategies. The aim of the research activity is both to define a methodology to assess energy and light performance of each configuration, through elaboration of experimental data, and an attempt to apply the methodology to the specific case, in order to test it. Experimental investigations in test cells and/or real scale mock-up provide high quality data, but their representativeness and direct application is not always straightforward. Dedicated data analysis procedures and methods need thus to be developed in order to translate experimental data in useful information. Moreover, investigations are usually carried out on either the thermal or the light aspects, while combined analyses are not common, since this increases the degree of complexity of the analysis and measurement requirements are often quite different. The ATF module equipped with extra-clear single glass pane (Module A) shows, compared to that with a low-e coated double pane glazing (Module B), an increase in the average luminance, over the analyzed surfaces, in the range 20 %- 52 % and 16 %- 81 %, in absence and in presence of the shading systems respectively. A higher amount of daylight is then guaranteed within the <b>indoor</b> space by <b>Module</b> A, but this might result in a higher probability of visual discomfort for the occupants. On the other hand, the Module B determines lower daily energy transmitted toward the <b>indoor</b> environment than <b>Module</b> A: on average, the daily energy gain/loss from/toward the outdoor environment are reduced of about 30 %, in summer (with or without the reflective roller screen), and in the range 30 - 40 % in winter (with or without the reflective roller screen...|$|R
40|$|PV modules {{have to have}} {{a service}} {{lifetime}} of more than 20 years. It is hard to follow suitable degradation indicators during service life testing with sufficient accuracy for reliable service life estimation. Often the polymeric encapsulation material, mostly ethylene vinyl acetate, shows degradation effects. The detection of small changes of the material in a non-destructive manner helps to follow the changes over time during <b>indoor</b> testing. PV <b>modules</b> with crystalline Si-cells of seven German manufacturers were analyzed after accelerated ageing tests with Raman spectroscopy. This technology allows non-destructive measurements of the encapsulation material through the glazing so that the degradation of the samples can be followed by measuring after different exposure times. Samples had been exposed to damp-heat conditions for up to 4000 h. The results show significant differences in the materials degradation above the edges and the center of the cell.

40|$|Photovoltaic (PV) modules {{are among}} the most effective, sustainable, and {{eco-friendly}} systems. A small portion of the incident solar radiation on a PV module is converted into electricity, whereas the remaining portion generates heat on the PV module layer, and consequently, decreases the output performance and efficiency of the module. Effective cooling systems can save energy and increase the performance of PV modules. In this study, various irradiation levels were applied to a PV <b>module</b> under <b>indoor</b> conditions to observe the temperature effects. A heat exchanger device was installed {{on the back of the}} module. Water flowed through the heat exchanger and radiator to cool the monocrystalline PV module. Results show that, under indoor conditions and without cooling, the total output power decreases by 20. 47 W, and electrical efficiency decreases by 3. 13 % when solar temperature increases by 43. 12 °C at 1000 W/m 2 irradiation level. This output performance is 41. 03 % lower than the initial output performance and equivalent to a decrease of approximately 0. 47 W in output power and 0. 07 % in electrical efficiency per 1 °C increase in solar cell temperature. For every 100 W/m 2 increase in irradiation intensity, output power increases by 2. 94 W with a 4. 11 °C increase in solar cell temperature. Indoors, a 17. 21 °C reduction in solar cell temperature increases output power by 8. 04 W and electrical efficiency by 1. 23 %, thereby producing output power and efficiency that are 27. 33 % higher than those without cooling condition. The outdoor investigation shows that, without cooling, electrical efficiency decreases by 5. 82 % with a 26. 10 °C increase in solar cell temperature during peak operating hours, thereby resulting in an output efficiency that is 43. 83 % lower than the initial output efficiency. Thus, electrical efficiency decreases by approximately 0. 22 % per 1 °C increase in solar cell temperature. For every 100 W/m 2 increase in irradiation intensity, output power increases by 3. 14 W with a 3. 82 °C increase in solar cell temperature. Outdoors, reducing solar cell temperature by 10. 28 °C increases output power by 7. 64 W and electrical efficiency by 1. 17 %, thereby resulting in an increase of 15. 72 % in both performance parameters with respect to those without cooling condition. Output power decreases by approximately 3. 16 W with an increase of 20 % in relative humidity (RH), and is reduced by 7. 70 W because of dust deposition on the surface of the <b>indoor</b> solar <b>module.</b> A decrease of approximately 1. 6 % in output efficiency occurs with an increase of 12. 10 % in RH, and this parameter decreases by 1. 34 % because of dust deposition on the surface of the outdoor solar module. Therefore, parameters such as solar cell temperature, irradiation intensity, cooling fluid mass flow rate, humidity, and dust influence PV module performance. Water cooling can be applied in large-capacity PV power generation plants located in tropical or hot-climate areas with exiguity of natural water resources. Different configurations of the heat exchanger device to cool PV modules, and consequently, improve performance can be considered in future studies...|$|R
