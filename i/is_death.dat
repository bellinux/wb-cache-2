5|$|A {{series of}} many genres, {{including}} fantasy, drama, coming of age, and the British school story (which includes elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror and romance), {{the world of}} Harry Potter explores numerous themes and includes many cultural meanings and references. According to Rowling, the main theme <b>is</b> <b>death.</b> Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.|$|E
5|$|The Sharia {{courts have}} general {{jurisdiction}} over most {{civil and criminal}} cases. At present, {{there are two types}} of courts of first instance: general courts and summary courts dealing with lesser cases. Cases are adjudicated by single judges, except criminal cases if the potential sentence <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> amputation or stoning when there is a panel of three judges. There are also two courts for the Shia minority in the Eastern Province dealing with family and religious matters. Appellate courts sit in Mecca and Riyadh and review decisions for compliance with Sharia.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, no {{official}} album accompanied the motion picture; however, there are ten songs {{featured in the}} film itself and two music videos embedded in its subsequent home release. Two singles of The Sounds, Dance with Me and Rock 'n Roll, were promoted on Kimberly's car stereo. Besides these, the music video of Seven Days a Week accompanied the film's DVD. Middle of Nowhere by The Blank Theory was both heard on Evan's car radio and inserted in the DVD along with its music video. Rocky Mountain High by John Denver was covered twice in the end credits by Pete Snell and Jude Christodal. Christodal also performed My Name <b>is</b> <b>Death</b> during Brian's death and the end credits. Other songs integrated were Highway to Hell by AC/DC (on Kimberly's car AV), Jon F. Hennessy by FT (on Rory's vehicle audio), Vitamin by Incubus (during Evan's house fire) and I Got You by (hed) Planet Earth (during Rory's party).|$|E

60|$|<b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not <b>death</b> if {{it kills}} {{no part of}} us save that which {{hindered}} us from perfect life. <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not <b>death,</b> if it raises us in a moment from darkness into light, from weakness into strength, from sinfulness into holiness. <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not <b>death,</b> if it brings us nearer to Christ who is the fount of life. <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not <b>death,</b> if it perfects our faith by sight, and lets us behold Him in whom we have believed. <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not <b>death,</b> if it gives us to those whom we have loved and lost, for whom we have lived, for whom we long to live again. <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not <b>death,</b> if it joins the child to the mother who <b>was</b> gone before. <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not <b>death,</b> if it takes away from that mother for ever all a mother's anxieties, a mother's fears, and lets her see, in the gracious countenance of her Saviour, a sure and certain pledge that those whom she has left behind are safe, safe with Christ and in Christ, through all the chances and dangers of this mortal life. <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not <b>death,</b> if it rids us of doubt and fear, of chance and change, of space and time, and all which space and time bring forth, and then destroy. <b>Death</b> <b>is</b> not death; for Christ has conquered death for Himself, {{and for those who}} trust in Him.|$|R
5|$|The Undiscovered Countrys Cold War allegory and {{references}} to literary history were recognized among researchers and cultural historians. According to scholar Larry Kreitzer, The Undiscovered Country has more references to William Shakespeare {{than any other}} Star Trek work until at least 1996. The title itself alludes to Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1. Meyer had originally intended The Wrath of Khan to be called The Undiscovered Country. Whereas the undiscovered country referred to in Hamlet (and its intended meaning in The Wrath of Khan) <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> Star Trek VIs use of the phrase refers to a future where Klingons and humans coexist in peace.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly inelastic (Ed = 0), changes in the price do not affect the quantity demanded for the good; raising prices will always cause total revenue to increase. Goods necessary to survival can be classified here; a rational person {{will be willing to}} pay anything for a good if the alternative <b>is</b> <b>death.</b> For example, a person in the desert weak and dying of thirst would easily give all the money in his wallet, no matter how much, for a bottle of water if he would otherwise die. His demand is not contingent on the price.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few <b>is</b> <b>death</b> to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight to read in books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

25|$|The Ashanti state, in effect, was a theocracy. It invokes religious, {{rather than}} secular-legal postulates. What {{the modern state}} views as crimes, Ashanti view as sins. Antisocial acts disrespect the ancestors, and are only {{secondarily}} harmful to the community. If the chief or King fails to punish such acts, he invokes the anger of the ancestors, and is therefore in danger of impeachment. The penalty for some crimes (sins) <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> but this is seldom imposed; a more common penalty is banishment or imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|Definite loss: The loss {{takes place}} at a known time, in a known place, and from a known cause. The classic example <b>is</b> <b>death</b> of an insured person on a life {{insurance}} policy. Fire, automobile accidents, and worker injuries may all easily meet this criterion. Other types of losses may only be definite in theory. Occupational disease, for instance, may involve prolonged exposure to injurious conditions where no specific time, place, or cause is identifiable. Ideally, the time, place, and cause of a loss should be clear enough that a reasonable person, with sufficient information, could objectively verify all three elements.|$|E

25|$|Omertà is a code {{of silence}} and secrecy that forbids mafiosi from betraying their comrades to the authorities. The penalty for {{transgression}} <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> and relatives of the turncoat may also be murdered. Mafiosi generally do not associate with police (aside perhaps from corrupting individual officers as necessary). For instance, a mafioso will not call the police when he {{is a victim of}} a crime. He is expected {{to take care of the}} problem himself. To do otherwise would undermine his reputation as a capable protector of others (see below), and his enemies may see him as weak and vulnerable.|$|E
25|$|During {{a trip to}} Italy {{not long}} before writing the novel, Hemingway had met young Adriana Ivancich, with whom he became infatuated, and he used her {{as the model for}} the female {{character}} in the novel. The novel's central theme <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> and, more importantly, how death is faced. One biographer and critic sees a parallel between Hemingway's Across the River and Into the Trees and Thomas Mann's Death in Venice. The novel is built upon successive layers of symbolism, and as in his other writing, Hemingway employs here his distinctive, spare style (the 'iceberg theory'), where the substance lies {{below the surface of the}} plot.|$|E
25|$|In medieval England, {{the penalty}} for {{a vast number of}} serious crimes, {{including}} murder, was death. This rule traveled with the colonists to America, and was the law in all states at the time the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791. By then, however, a problem with the common-law mandatory death penalty had crept into the legal system. If the jury has only two options—convicting a defendant of murder, where the penalty <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> or acquitting the defendant outright—it has no vehicle to express the sentiment that the defendant should be punished somehow, but not executed. Faced with this dilemma, some juries would acquit the defendant in order to spare his life. Of course, this meant that an obviously guilty person would go free.|$|E

25|$|The {{most common}} {{theme in the}} decoration, both {{external}} and internal, of any church, is the salvation of humankind by Jesus Christ. The decorative scheme often functions as a Poor Man's Bible, warning the church-goer that, in Biblical terms, the just rewards for his sinful nature <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> and that only through Jesus can forgiveness and redemption be gained. The scheme typically starts outside the church, on the west front, with the portrayal of Christ the Judge above the lintel of the main door. In Romanesque and Gothic buildings, this is usually a sculptural group, and may entail a whole scene of the Last Judgement with details of souls being weighed and rewarded, or dragged down to Hell by demons. In those churches in which painted rather than sculptured decoration prevails, the Last Judgement is often located on {{the interior of the}} west end, rather than the exterior.|$|E
25|$|Sindis' {{recurrent}} obsession <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> and he prophesies {{in detail}} {{about being an}} out-of-body witness to his funeral service and incineration, content that the flames would also consume his parasite. His tormented life is intertwined with those of desperate anti-heroes, including a gout-afflicted man who severs his own fingers, or a driller who was burned alive. When read as a camouflaged record of actual events in Bonciu's life, the novel reveals his claims about having been a witness to Vienna's artistic life under the Double Monarchy: Viennese writers such as Altenberg, Petzold, Wildgans, Peter Hille, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Arthur Schnitzler, Stefan Zweig appear as characters, and Endre Ady is a literary prototype. In {{one section of the}} book, Ramses discovers the beautiful Hilda, who is a painter, a muse, and the living artwork of Egon Schiele, and who ends up being eaten alive by her creator; before this happens, Hilda, Schiele and Ramses become entangled in a sadomasochistic ménage à trois.|$|E
500|$|Another theme {{prevalent}} in the novel <b>is</b> <b>death,</b> influenced {{in part by the}} death of Miller's father, to whom the book is dedicated.

The reviewer for The Australian called the novel [...] "a meditation on death and the frailty of the body and spirit".|$|E
