5|$|A further {{cause of}} the Lombard {{migration}} into Italy {{may have been an}} <b>invitation</b> from Narses. According to a controversial tradition reported by several medieval sources, Narses, out of spite for having been removed by Justinian's successor Justin II, called the Lombards to Italy. Often dismissed as an unreliable tradition, it has been studied with attention by modern scholars, in particular Neil Christie, who see in it a possible record of a formal <b>invitation</b> by the Byzantine state to settle in northern Italy as foederati, to help protect the region against the Franks, an arrangement that may have been disowned by Justin II after Narses' removal.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{academic}} community is under great pressure to publish. This pressure {{is compounded by}} high rejection rates at many journals. A more recent trend is for some journals to send <b>invitations</b> directly to researchers inviting them to submit a manuscript to their journals. Many researchers find these <b>invitations</b> annoying and unsure how best to respond to them. We collected electronic <b>invitations</b> to submit a manuscript to a journal between April 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015. We analyzed their content and cross-tabulated them against journals listed in Beall’s list of potential predatory journals. During this time period, 311 <b>invitations</b> were received for 204 journals, the majority of which were in Beall’s list (n[*]=[*] 244; 79  %). The <b>invitations</b> came throughout the calendar year and some journals sent up to six <b>invitations.</b> The majority of journals claimed to provide peer review (n[*]=[*] 179; 57. 6  %) although no mention was made of expedited review process. Similarly, {{more than half of}} the journals claimed to be open access (n[*]=[*] 186; 59. 8  %). The majority of <b>invitations</b> included an unsubscribe link (n[*]=[*] 187; 60. 1  %). About half of the <b>invitations</b> came from biomedical journals (n[*]=[*] 179). We discuss strategies researchers and institutions can consider to reduce the number of <b>invitations</b> received and strategies to handle those <b>invitations</b> that make it to the recipients’ inbox, thus helping to maintain the credibility and reputation of researchers and institutions...|$|R

5|$|An <b>invitation</b> {{was sent}} to the Launceston Cricket Club in February with a view to playing that March. The <b>invitation</b> was {{accepted}} but the match was delayed when the acceptance letter was not posted in time to reach the steamer transporting mail. The MCC repeated their <b>invitation</b> later in 1850. While the match was being arranged, legislation passed in the United Kingdom to separate the Port Phillip District, which was to be renamed as Victoria, from the colony of New South Wales. When news of this much anticipated decision reached the colony late in 1850, two weeks of celebrations were arranged in Melbourne to mark independence. The delayed cricket match, now scheduled for February 1851, became part of the general festivities, although formal independence did not come about until later in 1851. Furthermore, the fixture was to be the first Australian intercolonial match and was later considered the first first-class cricket match in Australia.|$|E

Learning <b>invitations</b> take many different forms but {{the aim is to}} create these <b>invitations</b> intentionally and systematically. This might be easier if there were some guidance to different styles of learning <b>invitations.</b> The Dharmic typology proposed builds upon ideas from Sāṃkhya— Yoga, particularly the notion of the three qualities of life (Triguṇa), which together are thought to construct everything much as pixels of three primary (RGB) colors create every photograph. Sattva is light, peace, harmony; it evokes a reflective, ethical, and holistic approach and learning <b>invitations</b> based on emulation and spiritual self-realization. Tamas is heavy, veiled and obstructive; it evokes feelings of inertia, lethargy and fearfulness and learning <b>invitations</b> based on disgust, repulsion and the wish for reform. Sattva and Tamas are static but the third quality, Rajas, burns with the fire of action. Rajas is desire, movement, change and energy; it evokes personal passions, material desires, emotion, excitement, ambition, anger and greed and its learning <b>invitations</b> invite change, often using personal gain as their lure. Three Rajasic invitational styles are discussed; those where action (Rajas) itself is the goal, where goodness (Sattva) is the goal, and where the domination of others is the goal (Tamas) ...|$|R
