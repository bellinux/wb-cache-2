25|$|Further signal {{transduction}} {{depends on the}} type of <b>G</b> <b>protein.</b> The enzyme adenylate cyclase {{is an example of a}} cellular protein that can be regulated by a <b>G</b> <b>protein,</b> in this case the <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> Gs.

5000|$|GAP {{are heavily}} {{linked to the}} G-protein linked {{receptor}} family. The activity of <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> comes from their ability to bind guanosine triphosphate (GTP).

25|$|Signal {{transduction}} by a GPCR {{begins with}} an inactive <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> coupled to the receptor; the <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> exists as a heterotrimer consisting of Gα, Gβ, and Gγ subunits. Once the GPCR recognizes a ligand, the conformation of the receptor changes to activate the <b>G</b> <b>protein,</b> causing Gα to bind a molecule of GTP and dissociate from the other two G-protein subunits. The dissociation exposes sites on the subunits that can interact with other molecules. The activated <b>G</b> <b>protein</b> subunits detach from the receptor and initiate signaling from many downstream effector proteins such as phospholipases and ion channels, the latter permitting the release of second messenger molecules. The total strength of signal amplification by a GPCR {{is determined by the}} lifetimes of the ligand-receptor complex and receptor-effector protein complex and the deactivation time of the activated receptor and effectors through intrinsic enzymatic activity; e.g. via protein kinase phosphorylation or b-arrestin-dependent internalization.|$|E

25|$|For the cholera toxin, the {{principal}} glycolipid receptor for the cholera toxin is ganglioside GM1. After endocytosis to the golgi apparatus, the toxin is redirected to the endoplasmic reticulum.

40|$|Abstract: Muscarinic {{acetylcholine}} receptors, which comprise five subtypes (M 1 -M 5 receptors), {{are expressed}} in both the CNS and PNS (particularly the target organs of parasympathetic neurons). M 1 -M 5 receptors are integral membrane proteins with seven trans-membrane segments, bind with acetylcholine (ACh) in the extracellular phase, and thereafter interact with and activate GTP-binding regulatory <b>proteins</b> (<b>G</b> <b>proteins)</b> in the intracellular phase: M 1, M 3, and M 5 receptors interact with Gq-type <b>G</b> <b>proteins,</b> and M 2 and M 4 receptors with Gi/Go-type <b>G</b> <b>proteins.</b> Activated <b>G</b> <b>proteins</b> initiate a number of intracellular signal transduction systems.
