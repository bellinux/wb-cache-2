At both ages, iron concentration increased markedly in the liver but failed to increase in the brain. In the liver of TMHF-treated young rats, levels of alpha- and <b>gamma-tocopherols</b> and glutathione (GSH) were also higher. In contrast, the brain displayed unaltered levels of the tocopherols and GSH. Malondialdehyde (MDA) level was also higher in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the liver but not in the brain. In old rats, the absence of an increase in iron concentration in the brain was reflected by unaltered concentrations of GSH, tocopherols, and MDA as compared to that in untreated rats.

40|$|International audienceArgan oil {{is widely}} used in Morocco in {{traditional}} medicine. Its ability to treat cardiovascular diseases is well-established. However, nothing is known about its effects on neurodegenerative diseases, which are often associated with increased oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation {{and the formation of}} 7 -ketocholesterol (7 KC) resulting from cholesterol auto-oxidation. As 7 KC induces oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death, it is important to identify compounds able to impair its harmful effects. These compounds may be either natural or synthetic molecules or mixtures of molecules such as oils. In this context: (i) the lipid profiles of dietary argan oils from Berkane and Agadir (Morocco) in fatty acids, phytosterols, tocopherols and polyphenols were determined by different chromatographic techniques; and (ii) their anti-oxidant and cytoprotective effects in 158 N murine oligodendrocytes cultured with 7 KC (25 - 50 mu M; 24 h) without and with argan oil (0. 1 % v/v) or -tocopherol (400 mu M, positive control) were evaluated with complementary techniques of cellular and molecular biology. Among the unsaturated fatty acids present in argan oils, oleate (C 18 : 1 n- 9) and linoleate (C 18 : 1 n- 6) were the most abundant; the highest quantities of saturated fatty acids were palmitate (C 16 : 0) and stearate (C 18 : 0). Several phytosterols were found, mainly schottenol and spinasterol (specific to argan oil), cycloartenol, beta-amyrin and citrostadienol alpha- and <b>gamma-tocopherols</b> were also present. Tyrosol and protocatechic acid were the only polyphenols detected. Argan and extra virgin olive oils have many compounds in common, principally oleate and linoleate, and tocopherols. Kit Radicaux Libres (KRL) and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) tests showed that argan and extra virgin olive oils have anti-oxidant properties. Argan oils were able to attenuate the cytotoxic effects of 7 KC on 158 N cells: loss of cell adhesion, cell growth inhibition, increased plasma membrane permeability, mitochondrial, peroxisomal and lysosomal dysfunction, and the induction of oxiapoptophagy (OXIdation + APOPTOsis + autoPHAGY). Altogether, our data obtained in 158 N oligodendrocytes provide evidence that argan oil is able to counteract the toxic effects of 7 KC on nerve cells, thus suggesting that some of its compounds could prevent or mitigate neurodegenerative diseases {{to the extent that they}} are able to cross the blood-brain barrier...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Alpha-Tocopherol and <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> are the {{two major}} forms of vitamin E in human plasma and the primary lipid soluble antioxidants. The dietary intake of <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> is {{generally}} {{higher than that of}} alpha-tocopherol. However, alpha-tocopherol plasma levels are about four fold higher than those of <b>gamma-tocopherol.</b> Among other factors, a preferential cellular uptake of <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> over alpha-tocopherol could contribute to the observed higher plasma alpha-tocopherol levels. In this investigation, we studied the uptake and depletion of both alpha-tocopherol and <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> (separately and together) in cultured RAW 264. 7 macrophages. Similar studies were performed with alpha-tocopheryl quinone and gamma-tocopheryl quinone, which are oxidation products of tocopherols. Results RAW 264. 7 macrophages showed a greater uptake of <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> compared to alpha-tocopherol (with uptake being defined as the net difference between tocopherol transported into the cells and loss due to catabolism and/or in vitro oxidation). Surprisingly, we also found that the presence of <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> promoted the cellular uptake of alpha-tocopherol. Mass balance considerations suggest that products other than quinone were formed during the incubation of tocopherols with macrophages. Conclusion Our data suggests that <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> could {{play a significant role in}} modulating intracellular antioxidant defence mechanisms. Moreover, we found the presence of <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> dramatically influenced the cellular accumulation of alpha-tocopherol, i. e., <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> promoted the accumulation of alpha-tocopherol. If these results could be extrapolated to in vivo conditions they suggest that <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> is selectively taken up by cells and removed from plasma more rapidly than alpha-tocopherol. This could, in part, contribute to the selective maintenance of alpha-tocopherol in plasma compared to <b>gamma-tocopherol.</b> </p...|$|E

The trait is controlled by recessive alleles at a single locus Tph 2 underlying a <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> methyltransferase (gamma-TMT). Additionally, unstable expression of increased <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> content {{in the range from}} 5 to 85 % has been reported. The objective of this research was to determine the genetic basis of unstable expression of high <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> content in sunflower seeds. Results Male sterile plants of nuclear male sterile line nmsT 2100, with stable high <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> content, were crossed with plants of line IAST- 1, with stable high <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> content but derived from a population that exhibited unstable expression of the trait. F 2 seeds showed continuous segregation for <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> content from 1. 0 to 99. 7 %. <b>Gamma-tocopherol</b> content in F 2 plants (average of 24 individual F 3 seeds) segregated from 59. 4 to 99. 4 %. A genetic linkage map comprising 17 linkage groups (LGs) was constructed from this population using 109 SSR and 20 INDEL marker loci, including INDEL markers for tocopherol biosynthesis genes. QTL analysis revealed a major QTL on LG 8 that corresponded to the gamma-TMT Tph 2 locus, which suggested that high <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> lines nmsT 2100 and IAST- 1 possess different alleles at this locus. Modifying genes were identified at LGs 1, 9, 14 and 16, corresponding in most cases with gamma-TMT duplicated loci. Conclusions Unstable expression of high <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> content is produced by the effect of modifying genes on tph 2 a allele at the gamma-TMT Tph 2 gene.

40|$|Alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) is {{synthesized}} from <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> in chloroplasts by <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> methyltransferase (gamma-TMT; VTE 4). Leaves of many {{plant species}} including Arabidopsis contain {{high levels of}} alpha-tocopherol, but are low in <b>gamma-tocopherol.</b> To unravel the function of different forms of tocopherol in plants, an Arabidopsis plant (vte 4 - 1) carrying a functional null mutation in the gene gamma-TMT was isolated by screening a mutant population via thin-layer chromatography. A second mutant allel (vte 4 - 2) carrying a T-DNA insertion in the coding sequence of gamma-TMT was identified in a T-DNA tagged mutant population. In vte 4 - 1 and vte 4 - 2 leaves, high levels of <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> accumulated, whereas alpha-tocopherol was absent indicating that, presumably, these two mutants represents null alleles. Over-expression of the gamma-TMT cDNA in vte 4 - 1 restored wild-type tocopherol composition. Mutant plants were very similar to wild type. During oxidative stress (high light, high temperature, cold treatment) the amounts of alpha-tocopherol and <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> increased in wild type, and <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> in vte 4 - 1. However, chlorophyll content and photosynthetic quantum yield were very similar in wild type and vte 4 - 1, suggesting that alpha-tocopherol can be replaced by <b>gamma-tocopherol</b> in vte 4 - 1 to protect the photosynthetic apparatus against oxidative stress. Fatty acid and lipid composition were very similar in WT, vte 4 - 1 and vte 1, an Arabidopsis mutant previously isolated which is completely devoid of tocopherol. Therefore, a shift in tocopherol composition or the absence of tocopherol has no major impact on the amounts of specific fatty acids or on lipid hydrolysis. [References: 43] 4...|$|E
