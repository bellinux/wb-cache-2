50|$|Most commonly, in a non-Newtonian fluid, the {{viscosity}} (the {{measure of}} a fluid's ability to resist gradual deformation by shear or tensile stresses) of the fluids is dependent on shear rate or shear rate history (time). These shear-thickening fluids are divided into two groups: time dependent and time-independent viscosity. In the case of time dependent viscosity, the apparent viscosity of a fluid changes with time as the fluid is continuously sheared. They can be termed as memory materials. If the apparent viscosity decreases with time, the fluid is called thixotropic and if it increases with time, it is called rheopectic. Thixotropic behaviour {{is the result of}} a break down in the microstructure of the material as shearing continues. This happens when the shear is exceeded of a limit. It leads to non-linear stress-strain behaviour. Thixotropy can be associated with the effect of bubbles. Examples of these types of fluids are gelatine, shortening, cream, paints, yogurt, xanthan gum solutions, aqueous iron oxide gels, gelatine gels, pectin gels, synovial fluid, <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>castor</b> <b>oil,</b> some clays (including bentonite, and montmorillonite), carbon black suspension in molten tire rubber, some drilling muds, many paints, many floc suspensions, and many colloidal suspensions. In the case of rheopatic fluids, the structure builds as shearing continues. Rheopectic behaviour may be described as time-dependent dilatant behaviour. This type of behaviour is much less common but can occur in highly concentrated starch solutions over long periods of time. Shear induced crystallization may be responsible for rheopatic behaviour. Other examples are gypsum pastes and printer inks.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve fast release of ibuprofen, {{slightly}} soluble model substance (0. 52104 mol/l), surfactant systems for oral use with different PEG- 40 <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> (C) /diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (T) ratios were investigated. Comparison between dissolution profiles for ibuprofen from formulated systems and from two commercial products, film tablets and soft capsules, is presented in this paper. Photon correlation spectroscopy has shown that after high dilution with water, surfactant systems were able to form micellar solutions. The size of micelles varies from 14. 8 ± 0, 075 nm to 16. 2 ± 0, 021 nm with increasing C/T ratio from 1 : 2 to 2 : 1. Although with increasing content of PEG- 40 <b>hydrogenated</b> <b>castor</b> <b>oil</b> larger micelles have formed, lower values of polydispersity index indicated that more homogeneous distribution of micelles size was gained. Conductometric analysis has demonstrated that system composing of C/T ratio 2 : 1, has shown most pronounced interaction between droplets, which {{can be seen as}} high rise of electrical conductivity with increasing water content (% (wwater/wtotal)) in the sample. No significant difference in percolation threshold between formulations with different C/T ratios was observed. Different surfactant systems were adsorbed on magnesium aluminometasilicate, as adsorbent with high specific active surface (≈ 300 m 2 /g), in order to investigate potential influence of adsorbent on ibuprofen dissolution rate. Formulated systems, with or without adsorbent were filled in hard gelatin capsules. The dissolution profiles of ibuprofen from different formulations were obtained in 30 minutes by dissolution apparatus with rotating baskets and compared with dissolution profiles of ibuprofen from commercial products. For formulations without adsorbent faster release of ibuprofen in first minutes of dissolution test, showed formulations with C/T ratio 2 : 1 and 1 : 1. Magnesium aluminometasilicate, as adsorbent with high specific surface area, significantly improved release rate of ibuprofen from formulation with C/T ratio 2 : 1, but, for formulation with C/T ratio 1 : 1, significantly lower release of ibuprofen was observed. Formulations with other C/T ratios in terms of fast ibuprofen release did not give satisfying results. Obtained results show that in comparison to dissolution profile of ibuprofen from commercial products proper C/T ratio as well as magnesium aluminometasilicate, as adsorbent with high specific surface area, can significantly increase release of ibuprofen...|$|E
