25|$|In 2006, two {{newspapers}} in New Zealand decided to republish controversial Danish cartoons depicting Muhammad, the prophet of Islam. The Muslim community registered their displeasure through press statements {{and a small}} peaceful march in Auckland. The editors {{said they did not}} mean offence but would not back down. Prime Minister Helen Clark and opposition leader Don Brash both made statements that the cartoons were not appreciated if they deeply offended members of the New Zealand community, but that such decisions were for editors to make, not politicians. Muslim leaders and the editors <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> the Race Relations office, and Jewish and Christian representatives in Wellington. As a result of this meeting the editors said they would not apologise but in good faith would refrain from publishing the offending images again.

500|$|Director Carl Theodor Dreyer began {{planning}} Vampyr in late 1929, a {{year after}} the release of his previous film The Passion of Joan of Arc. The production company behind Dreyer's previous film had plans for Dreyer to make another film, but the project was dropped which led to Dreyer deciding to go outside the studio system to make his next film. Being Dreyer's first sound film, it was made under difficult circumstances as the arrival of sound put the European film industry in turmoil. In France, film studios lagged behind technologically with the first French sound films being shot on sound stages in England. Dreyer went to England to study sound film, where he <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> Danish writer Christen Jul who was living in London at the time. Dreyer decided to create a story based on the supernatural and read over thirty mystery stories and found a number of re-occurring elements including doors opening mysteriously and door handles moving with no one knowing why. Dreyer decided that [...] "We can jolly well make this stuff too". In London and New York, the stage version of Dracula had been a large hit in 1927. Dreyer and Jul created a story based on vampires which Dreyer considered to be [...] "fashionable things at the time". Vampyr is based on elements from J. Sheridan Le Fanu's In a Glass Darkly, a collection of five stories first published in 1872. Dreyer draws from two of the stories for Vampyr, one being Carmilla, a vampire story with a lesbian subtext and the other being The Room in the Dragon Volant about a live burial. Dreyer found it difficult to decide on a title for the film. It may have initially been titled Destiny and then Shadows of Hell. When the film was presented in the film journal Close Up it was titled The Strange Adventure of David Gray.|$|E

Describing the effect it had on Nicole and Geoff, James stated: [...] "They have no food, shelter or clothing. [...] They find moments to make each other laugh, though, and realise how much they mean to one another." [...] Geoff had strong religious views and {{did not believe in}} premarital sex. However, the environment they were in caused him to let his guard down and they slept together. Lewis told TV Week that all the pair could think of whilst trapped was being rescued and their feelings for one an other. He added that [...] "the fact they were both pretty much naked didn't help". He concluded the fact they were both kids, trying to keep warm - that then [...] "stuff happens". Geoff was left [...] "guilt-ridden" [...] because he gave into temptation. He did not regret it, but acknowledged that he wanted to save his virginity until marriage. Therefore, Geoff saw no other option but to propose to Nicole. Lewis stated, [...] "He's not 100% sure about that either, but he feels that if they're going to have sex, a wedding is the only solution." [...] Describing Nicole's reaction he said that she was [...] "dumbfounded" [...] by his offer, as she had believed he was acting strange because he wanted to dump her. Nicole refused when she realised his reasons for proposing. According to James, the moment managed to ruin their passion, she also commented that: [...] "Nicole has liked Geoff for ages and was so happy to have <b>got</b> <b>together</b> <b>with</b> him - but now he's spoiled it." [...] James also admitted she was trilled to learn Nicole would turn down his proposal. James later opined that Nicole was [...] "the one" [...] for Geoff, but did not believe that Geoff was [...] "the one" [...] for Nicole.|$|E
