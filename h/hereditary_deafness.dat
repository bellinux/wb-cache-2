40|$|AbstractTo {{understand}} the molecular basis of sensory organ development and disease, we have cloned and characterized the zebrafish mutation dog-eared (dog) that is defective in {{formation of the}} inner ear and lateral line sensory systems. The dog locus encodes the eyes absent- 1 (eya 1) gene and single point mutations were found in three independent dog alleles, each prematurely truncating the expressed protein within the Eya domain. Moreover, morpholino-mediated knockdown of eya 1 gene function phenocopies the dog-eared mutation. In zebrafish, the eya 1 gene is widely expressed in placode-derived sensory organs during embryogenesis but Eya 1 function appears to be primarily required for survival of sensory hair cells in the developing ear and lateral line neuromasts. Increased levels of apoptosis occur in the migrating primordia of the posterior lateral line in dog embryos and {{as well as in}} regions of the developing otocyst that are mainly fated to give rise to sensory cells of the cristae. Importantly, mutation of the EYA 1 or EYA 4 gene causes <b>hereditary</b> syndromic <b>deafness</b> in humans. Determination of eya gene function during zebrafish organogenesis will facilitate understanding the molecular etiology of human vestibular and hearing disorders...|$|R

These models can improve our understanding of the complex genetic mechanisms involved in disease and provide a basis to guide therapeutic strategies to combat these conditions. We have identified a novel mouse model of non-syndromic sensorineural hearing loss with linkage to a region on chromosome 18. Eeyore mutant mice have early onset progressive hearing impairment and show abnormal structure of the sensory epithelium from as early as 4 weeks of age. Ultrastructural and histological analyses show irregular hair cell structure and degeneration of the sensory hair bundles in the cochlea. The identification of new genes involved in hearing is central to understanding the complex genetic pathways involved in the hearing process and the loci at which these pathways are interrupted in people with a genetic hearing loss. We therefore discuss possible candidate genes within the linkage region identified in eeyore that may underlie the deafness phenotype in these mice. Eeyore provides a new model of <b>hereditary</b> sensorineural <b>deafness</b> and will be an important tool in the search for novel deafness genes...|$|R

Through a variety of pathways, the mitochondria provide fuel (adenosine triphosphate) for cell survival. In addition, mitochondria now are recognized as a fundamental platform in cellular signaling, with crucial roles in a number of metabolic and developmental process, including cell autophagy, cell apoptosis (death), calcium, copper and iron homeostasis, and cell cycle regulation (Chan, 2006, Newmeyer and Ferguson-Miller, 2003, Nunnari and Suomalainen, 2012, Rubinsztein et al., 2011).

40|$|Dysfunction of gap {{junctions}} (GJs) {{caused by}} mutations in connexin 26 (Cx 26) and Cx 30 accounts {{for nearly half}} of all cases of <b>hereditary</b> nonsyndromic <b>deafness</b> cases. Although it is widely held that GJs connecting supporting cells in the organ of Corti mainly provide ionic pathways for rapid removal of K+ around the base of hair cells, the function of GJs in the cochlea remains unknown. Here we show that GJs were not assembled in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti until 3 days after birth in mice and then gradually matured to connect supporting cells before the onset of hearing. In organotypic cochlear cultures that were confirmed to express GJs, GJs mediated the propagation of intracellular Ca 2 + concentration waves in supporting cells by allowing intercellular diffusion of inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate. We found that a subset of structurally mild Cx 26 mutations located at the second transmembrane region (V 84 L, V 95 M, and A 88 S) and a Cx 30 mutation located at the first cytoplasmic segment (T 5 M) specifically affect the intercellular exchange of larger molecules but leave the ionic permeability intact. Our results indicated that Cx 26 and Cx 30 mutations that are linked to sensorineural deafness retained ionic coupling but were deficient in biochemical permeability. Therefore, GJ-mediated intercellular exchange of biochemically important molecules is required for normal cochlear functions...|$|R

40|$|A {{recent study}} {{revealed}} that Slitrk 6, a transmembrane protein containing a leucine-rich repeat domain, has {{a critical role in}} the development of the inner ear neural circuit. However, it is still unknown how the absence of Slitrk 6 affects auditory and vestibular functions. In addition, the role of Slitrk 6 in regions of the central nervous system, including the dorsal thalamus, has not been addressed. To understand the physiological role of Slitrk 6, Slitrk 6 -knockout (KO) mice were subjected to systematic behavioral analyses including auditory and vestibular function tests. Compared to wild-type mice, the auditory brainstem response (ABR) of Slitrk 6 -KO mice indicated a mid-frequency range (8 – 16 kHz) hearing loss and reduction of the first ABR wave. The auditory startle response was also reduced. A vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) test showed decreased vertical (head movement–induced) VOR gains and normal horizontal VOR. In an open field test, locomotor activity was reduced; the tendency to be in the center region was increased, but only in the first 5 min of the test, indicating altered adaptive responses to a novel environment. Altered adaptive responses were also found in a hole-board test in which headdip behavior was increased and advanced.
