5|$|Terpenes and isoprenoids, {{including}} the carotenoids, {{are made by}} the assembly and modification of <b>isoprene</b> units donated from the reactive precursors isopentenyl pyrophosphate and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate. These precursors {{can be made in}} different ways. In animals and archaea, the mevalonate pathway produces these compounds from acetyl-CoA, while in plants and bacteria the non-mevalonate pathway uses pyruvate and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate as substrates. One important reaction that uses these activated <b>isoprene</b> donors is steroid biosynthesis. Here, the <b>isoprene</b> units are joined together to make squalene and then folded up and formed into a set of rings to make lanosterol. Lanosterol can then be converted into other steroids such as cholesterol and ergosterol.|$|E
5|$|The terpenoids, {{sometimes}} referred to as isoprenoids, are organic chemicals similar to terpenes, derived from five-carbon <b>isoprene</b> units. There are over 10,000 known types of terpenoids. Most are multicyclic structures which differ from one another in both functional groups, and in basic carbon skeletons. Monoterpenoids, continuing 2 <b>isoprene</b> units, are volatile essential oils such as citronella, limonene, menthol, camphor, and pinene. Diterpenoids, 4 <b>isoprene</b> units, are widely distributed in latex and resins, and can be quite toxic. Diterpenes are responsible for making Rhododendron leaves poisonous. Plant steroids and sterols are also produced from terpenoid precursors, including vitamin D, glycosides (such as digitalis) and saponins (which lyse red blood cells of herbivores).|$|E

50|$|Of {{the various}} methods of {{cannabis}} consumption, smoking {{is considered the}} most harmful; the inhalation of smoke from organic materials can cause various health problems (e.g., coughing and sputum). <b>Isoprenes</b> help to modulate and slow down reaction rates, contributing to the significantly differing qualities of partial combustion products from various sources.|$|R
5|$|The milk cap's fruit {{bodies have}} a {{characteristic}} orange milk juice (latex). The guaiane sesquiterpenes {{are responsible for}} the orange colour. Sesquiterpenes are terpenes composed of three <b>isoprene</b> units and therefore have 15 carbon atoms. Sesquiterpenes are widely distributed in nature and are found in plants as well as animals, for example in the juvenile hormone of insects. Plants use sesquiterpenes as a defense compound against insects. According to some studies, sesquiterpenes have antibiotic, anticarcinogenic, or immunostimulant effects.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to their}} natural {{polyisoprene}} content (1.1–7.7% by dry weight of fruit bodies), L.volemus fruit bodies {{can also be}} used to produce rubber. The chemical structure of rubber from the mushroom consists of a high molecular mass homologue of polyprenol, arranged as a dimethylallyl group, two trans <b>isoprene</b> units, a long sequence of cis isoprenes (between 260–300 units), terminated by a hydroxyl or fatty acid ester. Biosynthetically, the creation of the polyisoprene begins with the compound trans,trans-farnesyl pyrophosphate, and is thought to terminate by esterification of polyisoprenyl pyrophosphate. The enzyme isopentenyl-diphosphate delta isomerase has been identified as required for the initiation of rubber synthesis in L.volemus and several other milk cap species.|$|E

30|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activities and}} toxicity of essential oil have been documented, but their modes of action {{are complex and}} still in some cases unknown, considering {{the large number of}} different groups of chemical compounds present, this activity is due to the presence of active constituents, mainly attributable to <b>isoprenes</b> such as monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and related alcohols, other hydrocarbons and phenols [1].|$|R
40|$|The {{production}} of biofuels via microbial biotechnol-ogy {{is a very}} active field of research. A range of fuel molecule types are currently under consideration: alcohols, ethers, esters, <b>isoprenes,</b> alkenes and alkanes. At the present, the major alcohol biofuel is ethanol. The ethanol fermentation is an old technol-ogy. Ongoing efforts aim to increase yield and energy efficiency of ethanol production from biomass. n-Butanol, another microbial fermentation product, is potentially superior to ethanol as a fuel but suffers from low yield and unwanted side-products currently. In general, biodiesel fuels consist of fatty acid methyl esters in which the carbon derives from plants, not microbes. A new biodiesel product, called microdie-sel, can be generated in engineered bacterial cells that condense ethanol with fatty acids. Perhaps the best fuel type to generate from biomass would be biohydrocarbons. Microbes are known to produce hydrocarbons such as <b>isoprenes,</b> long-chain alkenes and alkanes. The biochemical mechanisms of micro-bial hydrocarbon biosynthesis are currently under study. Hydrocarbons and minimally oxygenated mol-ecules may also be produced by hybrid chemical and biological processes. A broad interest in novel fuel molecules is also driving {{the development of new}} bioinformatics tools to facilitate biofuels research...|$|R
30|$|Lipids are {{hydrophobic}} or amphipathic {{molecules that}} contain unique structural and biological properties. They originate entirely {{or in part}} from biochemical building blocks of ketoacyl thioesters and/or <b>isoprenes</b> [1, 2]. Lipids function as an energy reservoir and serve as major structural components of biological membranes such as plasma membranes, membranes of intracellular organelles, and lipid transporters [3]. Lipids also participate in signal transduction as chemical messengers and interact with proteins to regulate their functions [4, 5]. Furthermore, lipids are important bioactive molecules in the body’s immune system against viral and bacterial infections [6].|$|R
25|$|Natural rubber, {{also called}} India rubber or caoutchouc, as {{initially}} produced, consists of polymers {{of the organic}} compound <b>isoprene,</b> with minor impurities of other organic compounds, plus water.

25|$|Chemically, carotenes are {{polyunsaturated}} hydrocarbons containing 40 carbon atoms per molecule, variable {{numbers of}} hydrogen atoms, {{and no other}} elements. Some carotenes are terminated by hydrocarbon rings, on one or {{both ends of the}} molecule. All are coloured to the human eye, due to extensive systems of conjugated double bonds. Structurally carotenes are tetraterpenes, meaning that they are synthesized biochemically from four 10-carbon terpene units, which in turn are formed from eight 5-carbon <b>isoprene</b> units.|$|E
25|$|The {{required}} {{isopentenyl pyrophosphate}} is {{obtained from the}} mevalonate pathway, which derives from acetyl-CoA in the cytosol. In plants, <b>isoprene</b> pyrophosphate can also {{be obtained from the}} 1-deox-D-xyulose-5-phosphate/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway within plasmids. The relative ratio of the farnesyl pyrophosphate initiator unit and isoprenyl pyrophosphate elongation monomer determines the rate of new particle synthesis versus elongation of existing particles. Though rubber is known to be produced by only one enzyme, extracts of latex host numerous small molecular weight proteins with unknown function. The proteins possibly serve as cofactors, as the synthetic rate decreases with complete removal.|$|E
50|$|In {{molecular}} biology, the GHMP kinase {{family is}} a family of kinase enzymes. Members of this family include homoserine kinases , galactokinases , and mevalonate kinases. These kinases make up the GHMP kinase superfamily of ATP-dependent enzymes. These enzymes {{are involved in the}} biosynthesis of <b>isoprenes</b> and amino acids as well as in carbohydrate metabolism. These enzymes contain, in their N-terminal section, a conserved Gly/Ser-rich region which is probably involved in the binding of ATP. The C-terminal domain of homoserine kinase has a central alpha-beta plait fold and an insertion of four helices, which, together with the N-terminal fold, creates a novel nucleotide binding fold.|$|R
40|$|Monoterpenes are {{naturally}} occurring hydrocarbons {{composed of two}} units of <b>isoprenes.</b> They exhibit antioxidant activity to scavenge reactive oxygen species, such as hydroxyl radicals. We investigated the potential of monoterpenes such as thymol, linalool, and menthol to act as radioprotectants. The proliferation of EL 4 cells, a mouse lymphoma cell line, treated with linalool at a concentration of 500 μM or more was not affected by X-ray irradiation. Plasmid-nicking assay performed using formamidopyrimidine-DNA glycosylase showed that linalool prevented single strand breaks and oxidized purines on pUC 19 plasmid DNA.

25|$|One {{important}} thing to consider when assessing the urban forest's effect on air quality is that trees emit some biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). These are the chemicals (primarily <b>isoprene</b> and monoterpenes) {{that make up the}} essential oils, resins, and other organic compounds that plants use to attract pollinators and repel predators. As mentioned above, VOCs react with nitrogen oxides (NOx) to form ozone. BVOCs account for less than 10% of the total amount of BVOCs emitted in urban areas. This means that BVOC emissions from trees can contribute to the formation of ozone. Although their contribution may be small compared with other sources, BVOC emissions could exacerbate a smog problem.|$|E
25|$|Polymerization of alkenes is a {{reaction}} that yields polymers of high industrial value at great economy, {{such as the}} plastics polyethylene and polypropylene. Polymers from alkene monomers are referred to {{in a general way}} as polyolefins or in rare instances as polyalkenes. A polymer from alpha-olefins is called a polyalphaolefin (PAO). Polymerization can proceed via either a free-radical or an ionic mechanism, converting the double to a single bond and forming single bonds to join the other monomers. Polymerization of conjugated dienes such as buta-1,3-diene or <b>isoprene</b> (2-methylbuta-1,3-diene) results in largely 1,4-addition with possibly some 1,2-addition of the diene monomer to a growing polymer chain.|$|E
25|$|In plants, algae, {{and other}} {{photosynthetic}} organisms, lycopene {{is an important}} intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids, including beta-carotene, {{which is responsible for}} yellow, orange, or red pigmentation, photosynthesis, and photoprotection. Like all carotenoids, lycopene is a polyunsaturated hydrocarbon, i.e. an unsubstituted alkene. Structurally, lycopene is a tetraterpene and assembled from eight <b>isoprene</b> units that are composed entirely of carbon and hydrogen. It is insoluble in water. Lycopene's eleven conjugated double bonds give its deep red color and its antioxidant activity in vitro. Owing to the strong color, lycopene is a useful food coloring (registered as E160d) and is approved for usage in the USA, Australia and New Zealand (registered as 160d) and the EU.|$|E
40|$|Formaldehyde (HCHO) is an {{important}} indicator of photochemical activity and hydrocarbon reactivity in the troposphere. In the continental boundary layer it reflects hydrocarbon production from biogenic activity, including forest production of <b>isoprenes.</b> In the remote marine troposphere, where methane oxidation dominates its production, HCHO is {{an important}} proxy for tropospheric OH, which cannot be measured from satellites by any currently envisaged technique. We present vertical column abundances of HCHO retrieved from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment (GOME) spectrometer aboard the ERS- 2 satellite.

Data on the phenotype and laboratory indicators of mevalonate aciduria mainly refer to long term observations, and emphasize the absence of hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis, or lactic academia. In several affected families, prenatal diagnosis has been achieved, and stillbirths or malformed fetuses have been described.

40|$|Deliberate {{and natural}} {{outbreaks}} of infectious disease, {{the prevalence of}} antibiotic resistant strains, and the ease by which antibiotic resistant bacteria can be intentionally engineered all underscore the necessity of effective vaccines and continued development of novel antimicrobial/antiviral therapeutics. <b>Isoprenes,</b> a group of molecules fundamentally involved {{in a variety of}} crucial biological functions, are derived from either the mevalonic acid (MVA) or methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway.

25|$|Lycopene is a {{symmetrical}} tetraterpene assembled {{from eight}} <b>isoprene</b> units. It {{is a member}} of the carotenoid family of compounds, and because it consists entirely of carbon and hydrogen, is also a carotene. Isolation procedures for lycopene were first reported in 1910, and the structure of the molecule was determined by 1931. In its natural, all-trans form, the molecule is long and straight, constrained by its system of eleven conjugated double bonds. Each extension in this conjugated system reduces the energy required for electrons to transition to higher energy states, allowing the molecule to absorb visible light of progressively longer wavelengths. Lycopene absorbs all but the longest wavelengths of visible light, so it appears red.|$|E
25|$|Amber can be {{classified}} into several forms. Most fundamentally, {{there are two types}} of plant resin with the potential for fossilization. Terpenoids, produced by conifers and angiosperms, consist of ring structures formed of <b>isoprene</b> (C5H8) units. Phenolic resins are today only produced by angiosperms, and tend to serve functional uses. The extinct medullosans produced a third type of resin, which is often found as amber within their veins. The composition of resins is highly variable; each species produces a unique blend of chemicals which can be identified by the use of pyrolysis–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The overall chemical and structural composition is used to divide ambers into five classes. There is also a separate classification of amber gemstones, according to the way of production.|$|E
25|$|Many {{other plants}} produce forms of latex rich in <b>isoprene</b> polymers, {{though not all}} produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more {{elaborate}} processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most {{are more difficult to}} tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example gutta-percha (Palaquium gutta) and chicle from Manilkara species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (Ficus elastica), Panama rubber tree (Castilla elastica), various spurges (Euphorbia spp.), lettuce (Lactuca species), the related Scorzonera tau-saghyz, various Taraxacum species, including common dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) and Russian dandelion (Taraxacum kok-saghyz), and perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, guayule (Parthenium argentatum). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.|$|E
40|$|A good {{predictive}} {{relationship between}} summer ozone levels and precipitation {{in the two}} preceding winters, first reported in 1978, has been confirmed in an additional 13 years of data. Biogenic hydrocarbon emiss~ons were hypothesized to be the link in this relationsh~p, where winter rain is the primary stress on biomass growth (as indicated by dendrochronology) in a California Mediterranean-type climate. The correlation in regional total hydrocarbon data deteriorated badly, but these measurements are very insensitive to changes in C 10 terpenes and Cg <b>isoprenes.</b> The order-of-magnitude estimate of biogenic organics emissions, made in 1978, has been confirmed by later regional inventories. Over the recent data period (1978 - 1990) a regression of annual excesses of the 0. 09 ppm California ozone standard, against year (as a surrogate for anthropogenic emissions decreases), a winter rain factor, and a summer maximum temperature factor explained 93. 2 % of the variance.

25|$|An {{elevated}} {{concentration of}} plasma cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, is now generally {{accepted as a}} major risk factor {{for the development of}} coronary heart disease. The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the <b>isoprenes</b> that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is {{at the level of the}} microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years.|$|R

25|$|Biomolecular {{chemistry}} {{is a major}} category within organic chemistry which is frequently studied by biochemists. Many complex multi-functional group molecules are important in living organisms. Some are long-chain biopolymers, and these include peptides, DNA, RNA and the polysaccharides such as starches in animals and celluloses in plants. The other main classes are amino acids (monomer building blocks of peptides and proteins), carbohydrates (which includes the polysaccharides), the nucleic acids (which include DNA and RNA as polymers), and the lipids. In addition, animal biochemistry contains many small molecule intermediates which assist in energy production through the Krebs cycle, and produces <b>isoprene,</b> the most common hydrocarbon in animals. Isoprenes in animals form the important steroid structural (cholesterol) and steroid hormone compounds; and in plants form terpenes, terpenoids, some alkaloids, and a class of hydrocarbons called biopolymer polyisoprenoids present in the latex of various species of plants, which {{is the basis for}} making rubber.|$|E

This mesogenic peak is generally masked by the foot of the broad ionic peak. The ionic peak Bragg spacing is much larger in the LC H(S) TP than in the H(S) TP precursor; This increased interaggregate distance results from the hindrance due to the mesogenic organization and from the restricted mobility experienced by the chains closely attached to the mesogen layers.

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the cholesterol precursor, mevalonate, regulates S-phase DNA replication was examined in synchronized BHK cells. As previously demonstrated by this laboratory, blocking 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-CoA reductase [mevalonate:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating), EC 1. 1. 1. 34] with the competitive inhibitor compactin suppresses DNA synthesis specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle. In the present study, known mevalonate derivatives were examined as possible mediators by which mevalonate controls DNA replication. Of the compounds studied, only isopentenyladenine and its 4 '-hydroxylated analogue, zeatin, could substitute for mevalonate in restoring DNA replication in compactin-blocked cells. Moreover, these two derivatives proved {{to be at least}} 100 times more active than mevalonate, and both restored DNA relication to normal within 15 min of their being added to the medium. In addition, isopentenyladenine, like mevalonate, stimulated DNA synthesis specifically during the S phase of the cell cycle. Isopentenyladenine also reversed the inhibition of DNA synthesis caused by nalidixic acid, an antibiotic that does not inhibit cholesterol synthesis. These findings indicate that isopentenyladenine or a closely related derivative may mediate the regulatory role of mevalonate in DNA replication and suggest that such <b>isoprenes</b> may act upon DNA replication at a site common to that inhibited by nalidixic acid...|$|R
