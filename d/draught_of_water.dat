60|$|At {{this point}} of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Before she answered, muttering [...] "After the mistress, the maid," [...] Nehushta {{swallowed}} a deep <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> in her turn, which, indeed, she needed sorely. Then {{she told her}} all.|$|E
6000|$|Sieg. [...] I looked, as a dying soldier [...] 120 [...] Looks at a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> {{for this}} man; [...] But still I saw him not; {{but in his}} stead---- ...|$|E
60|$|Morris ate {{his dinner}} in silence, not seeing {{anything}} further {{to do or}} say. His food choked him, and he {{found it necessary to}} drink great <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|When, about noon, {{they came}} to a clear spring <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> they were glad enough to sit down and rest and partake of their noonday lunch, washing it down with copious <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|Fortunately {{no bones}} were broken, and a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> clear <b>water,</b> brought by Jacques from a {{neighbouring}} pond, speedily restored Harry's shaken faculties.|$|R
6000|$|A {{breath of}} wind, a Border bullet's flight, A <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> or a horse's fright-- [...] The droning {{of the fat}} Sheristadar Ceases, the punkah stops, and falls the night ...|$|E
6000|$|Thus admonished, the story-teller {{cleared his}} throat, wished {{intensely}} for a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and taxed his fertile brain to the uttermost. At last under {{a feeling of}} absolute desperation, he began-- ...|$|E
60|$|He {{took a long}} <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> then ate some food. His head throbbed {{with the}} pain of the wound. It had been roughly bandaged by his captors, but needed {{surgical}} dressing.|$|E
6000|$|MARMADUKE [...] A minute past, he went {{to fetch}} a <b>draught</b> [...] <b>Of</b> <b>water</b> from the torrent. 'Tis, you'll say, [...] A cheerless beverage.|$|R
60|$|Silence reigned at first. When the Indian had {{finished}} eating he accepted a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> warm <b>water,</b> {{and then had}} recourse to his fire-bag and pipe. Cheenbuk expected this, and smiled inwardly, though his outward visage would have done credit to an owl.|$|R
60|$|Oliver walked {{twenty miles}} that day; {{and all that}} time tasted nothing but the crust of dry bread, and a few <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> which he begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side. When the night came, he turned into a meadow; and, {{creeping}} close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there, till morning. He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and more alone {{than he had ever}} felt before. Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.|$|R
6000|$|A {{breath of}} wind, a Border bullet's flight, [...] A <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> or a horse's fright-- [...] The droning {{of the fat}} Sheristadar [...] Ceases, the punkah stops, and falls the night ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Slightly. It will do me service. I am {{somewhat}} feverish. A kingdom for a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water!</b> And {{now for our}} wounded friends. Asriel, do you marshal the camp. It is the Sabbath eve.[62] Time presses.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And how do you, {{being an}} Englishman," [...] said the knight, [...] "protect {{your life and}} {{property}} here, when one of your nation cannot obtain a single night's lodging, or a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> were he thirsty?" ...|$|E
60|$|With one glance round, Cuthbert {{was assured}} that escape from this garden, at least, {{was not to}} be thought of, and that for the present {{patience}} alone was possible. Dismissing all ideas of that kind from his mind, he set to work with a steady attention to his task. He was very fond of flowers, and soon he became so absorbed in his work as almost to forget that he was a slave. It was not laborious--digging, planting, pruning and training the flowers, and giving them copious <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> from a large fountain {{in the center of the}} garden.|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll make nothing by trade," [...] {{continued}} he; [...] "nothing {{more than}} the crust of dry bread and the <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> fair <b>water</b> on which you now live; your only chance of getting a competency lies in marrying a rich widow, or running away with an heiress." ...|$|R
6000|$|Rosamond talked. She {{always had}} a certain embarrassment in tete-a- tetes with Cecil, and it took form in a flow of words. [...] "Poor Terry! he turned faint and giddy at breakfast. I thought he had been indulging at the refreshment-stall, {{but he says he}} was saving for a fine copy of the Faerie Queen that Friskyball told him of at a book- stall at Backsworth, and existed all day on <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> when his throat grew dry as showman; so I suppose it is only inanition, coupled with {{excitement}} and stuffiness, and that quiet will repair him. He would not hear of my staying with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'A weary way and long,' {{rejoined the}} {{traveller}} as {{he shook his}} head. 'A weary, weary, way. I struck my stick just now upon the bucket of your well--be pleased to {{let me have a}} <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> lady.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear old soul, I'll be good by-and-by, but now I'm {{tired and}} cross, {{so let me}} keep out of every one's way and drowse myself into a cheerier frame of mind. I want nothing but solitude, a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and a kiss." ...|$|E
60|$|He applied {{himself to}} a pump in the yard; and, having taken a deep <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and flung a {{quantity}} {{on his head and}} face, regained his accustomed manner and led the way into the house: Gride following close at his heels.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] said Dr. May impatiently, [...] "the fewer the better;" [...] and hastily passing her, he dashed {{up to his}} room, nearly {{running over}} the nursery procession, and, in a very few seconds, was seated at table, eating and {{speaking}} by snatches, and swallowing endless <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>water.</b>|$|R
60|$|Leaping Horse and his {{companion}} had stolen away {{as soon as}} the loads had been adjusted. The others led the horses to the river, and allowed them to drink, while Jerry and Tom lay down and took a long <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water.</b> The miners' bottles were filled, and they then started.|$|R
60|$|Having {{secured the}} specimen, {{they set off}} at once to visit the hot springs, after {{pricking}} a traveller's tree with a spear and obtaining a refreshing <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> cool clear <b>water</b> therefrom.|$|R
6000|$|The frugal supper {{having been}} washed {{down with a}} <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> from Nature's own cup--the joined hands--Adolay lay down under the canoe. Cheenbuk retired to a {{neighbouring}} spruce-fir and stretched himself under its branches. Need we add that sleep closed their eyelids instantly? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would think}} little of it, had you seen more {{stricken}} fields, young Knight," [...] said Gaston, attempting to smile; [...] "I am only spent with loss of blood. Bring me a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> and I can {{ride back to}} the tent. But look to your prisoner, Sir Eustace." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{guarding}} was of {{the strangest}} and cruellest. The prisoners were made to lie flat down on the ground--many of them having been previously stripped nearly naked; and {{if any of them}} ventured to change their positions, or raise their heads to implore a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> they were instantly shot.|$|E
60|$|I may truly {{say that}} when I saw the doleful state of the poor wretch, and how he lay there {{without so much as}} a single soul to moisten his lips or to give him a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>water,</b> I forgot mine own {{troubles}} for the time being, and thought only of his pitiable condition.|$|R
60|$|How {{long were}} we {{in that place}} after this? At least three whole days and nights, I believe, if not more, but of course we soon lost all count of time. At first we {{suffered}} agonies from famine, which we strove in vain to assuage with great <b>draughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>water.</b> No doubt these kept us alive, but even Higgs, who it may be remembered was a teetotaller, afterwards confessed {{to me that he}} has loathed the sight and taste <b>of</b> <b>water</b> ever since. Indeed he now drinks beer and wine like other people. It was torture; we could have eaten anything. In fact the Professor did manage to catch and eat a bat that got entangled in his red hair. He offered me a bite of it, I remember, and was most grateful when I declined.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Crackit {{stopped to}} take a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> spirits and <b>water,</b> and to declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to {{about the level of}} his eye, he quietly resumed.|$|R
60|$|While {{waiting for}} the water to rise, stores of {{provisions}} were collected in all the principal towns, and 200 vessels of small <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water</b> gathered in readiness. Unfortunately no sooner had the work been done than the prince was attacked by a violent fever, brought on by anxiety and exertion.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have had}} overmuch wassail already," [...] said poor Oliver, [...] "and {{have been well}} nigh drowned in it. That accursed calabash! A <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> kind gossip--you will not surely let me ask for that in vain? or, if it is your will, a cup of cold small ale." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Dumps," [...] said I, {{finishing}} my {{meal with}} a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> <b>water,</b> {{which is my}} favourite beverage, [...] "you must not suppose that {{you have got a}} greedy master; though I don't allow begging. There, sir, is your corner, where you shall always have the remnants of my dinner--come." ...|$|E
60|$|The tall girls {{went out}} and {{returned}} presently, each bearing a tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher <b>of</b> <b>water</b> and mug {{in the middle of}} each tray. The portions were handed round; those who liked took a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> the <b>water,</b> the mug being common to all. When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{not quite}} so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of cold meat, another <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> Madeira and <b>water,</b> will make you nearly {{on a par with}} the rest of us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When thou canst {{show why}} a <b>draught</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>water</b> should have cured thee when the most {{precious}} drugs failed," [...] said the Hakim, [...] "thou mayest reason on the other mysteries attendant on this matter. For myself, I am inefficient to the great work, having this morning touched an unclean animal. Ask, therefore, no further questions; it is enough that, by sparing this man's life at my request, you will deliver yourself, great King, and thy servant, from a great danger." ...|$|R
