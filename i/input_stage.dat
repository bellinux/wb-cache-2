25|$|Common-mode gain: A perfect {{operational}} amplifier amplifies only the voltage difference between its two inputs, completely rejecting all voltages {{that are common}} to both. However, the differential <b>input</b> <b>stage</b> of an {{operational amplifier}} is never perfect, leading to the amplification of these common voltages to some degree. The standard measure of this defect is called the common-mode rejection ratio (denoted CMRR). Minimization of common mode gain is usually important in non-inverting amplifiers (described below) that operate at high amplification.|$|E
25|$|The μA709, which {{followed}} the compromised μA702, became a technical and commercial success. Widlar increased the μA709's voltage gain tenfold over {{that of the}} μA702 (70,000 vs. 7,000), and improved output performance with a push-pull output stage, although the output lacked protection against short circuit. The <b>input</b> <b>stage</b> was governed by a Widlar current source which allowed operation at low currents. The transistors were equipped with beta-compensation resistors to level the inevitable mismatch in their performance. Fairchild R staff spoke against Widlar's decision to employ lateral PNP transistors. Widlar locked himself up for 170 hours of continuous experimental work and {{came out with a}} robust design that blended two resistive diffusion areas into a lateral PNP device.|$|E

25|$|Input offset voltage: This voltage, {{which is}} what is {{required}} across the op-amp's input terminals to drive the output voltage to zero. In the perfect amplifier, {{there would be no}} input offset voltage. However, it exists in actual op-amps because of imperfections in the differential amplifier that constitutes the <b>input</b> <b>stage</b> of the vast majority of these devices. Input offset voltage creates two problems: First, due to the amplifier's high voltage gain, it virtually assures that the amplifier output will go into saturation if it is operated without negative feedback, even when the input terminals are wired together. Second, in a closed loop, negative feedback configuration, the input offset voltage is amplified along with the signal and this may pose a problem if high precision DC amplification is required or if the input signal is very small.|$|E
25|$|Gifford {{said that}} Widlar and Talbert were {{actually}} {{the founders of}} National Semiconductor, and that Sporck joined them later. The duo started by setting up the epitaxial process at Santa Clara. Once the technology was in place, Widlar concentrated on voltage regulators {{and by the end}} of 1966 produced the industry's first integrated linear regulator. The LM100, a revolutionary new circuit, became another flagship product that surpassed expectations for sales and longevity. In 1967 Widlar designed the LM101, an operational amplifier with improved gain, decreased input current, and protection against short circuit. The LM101 featured another unorthodox <b>input</b> <b>stage,</b> employing NPN input transistors emitter coupled to PNP transistors in a common base arrangement. The high reverse breakdown voltage of the PNP transistors allowed the LM101 to withstand a differential input voltage of ±30 V. Its frequency compensation was simpler and more robust and stable than that of μA709. It was followed by LM101A, a functionally identical IC that pioneered the use of a field-effect transistor to control internal current sources. Widlar's solution minimized die area and current drain, and enabled operation over a wide range of power supply voltages. Later he devised another new device, the super-beta transistor. It was created in silicon by Talbert and integrated in the LM108 precision operational amplifier, which was released in 1969. These high-gain, very-low-voltage devices were capable of operating at very low input currents within the full military range of operating conditions. The items in the linear circuit product line were user friendly, very useful, and very profitable.|$|E

Ragazzini of Columbia University. In this same paper a footnote mentioned an op-amp design by a student that {{would turn out to}} be quite significant. This op-amp, designed by Loebe Julie, was superior in a variety of ways. It had two major innovations. Its <b>input</b> <b>stage</b> used a long-tailed triode pair with loads matched to reduce drift in the output and, far more importantly, it was the first op-amp design to have two inputs (one inverting, the other non-inverting). The differential input made a whole range of new functionality possible, but it would not be used for a long time due to the rise of the chopper-stabilized amplifier.|$|E

2500|$|A crystal {{microphone}} or piezo microphone uses {{the phenomenon of}} piezoelectricity—the ability of some materials to produce a voltage when subjected to pressure—to convert vibrations into an electrical signal. An {{example of this is}} potassium sodium tartrate, which is a piezoelectric crystal that works as a transducer, both as a microphone and as a slimline loudspeaker component. Crystal microphones were once commonly supplied with vacuum tube (valve) equipment, such as domestic tape recorders. [...] Their high output impedance matched the high input impedance (typically about 10megohms) of the vacuum tube <b>input</b> <b>stage</b> well. They were difficult to match to early transistor equipment, and were quickly supplanted by dynamic microphones for a time, and later small electret condenser devices. The high impedance of the {{crystal microphone}} made it very susceptible to handling noise, both from the microphone itself and from the connecting cable.|$|E
2500|$|Slewing: The amplifier's {{output voltage}} reaches its maximum rate of change, the slew rate, usually {{specified}} in volts per microsecond. When slewing occurs, further {{increases in the}} input signal {{have no effect on}} the rate of change of the output. Slewing is usually caused by the <b>input</b> <b>stage</b> saturating; the result is a constant current [...] driving a capacitance [...] in the amplifier (especially those capacitances used to implement its frequency compensation); the slew rate is limited by [...]Slewing is associated with the large-signal performance of an op-amp. [...] Consider, for example, an op-amp configured for a gain of 10. [...] Let the input be a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth wave. That is, the amplitude is 1 V and the period is 10 microseconds. Accordingly, the rate of change (i.e., the slope) of the input is 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] After 10x amplification, the output should be a 10 V, [...] 100kHz sawtooth, with a corresponding slew rate of 1 V per microsecond. [...] However, the classic 741 op-amp has a 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate specification, so that its output can rise to no more than 5 V in the sawtooth's 10 microsecond period. Thus, if one were to measure the output, it would be a 5 V, 100kHz sawtooth, rather than a 10 V, 100kHz sawtooth.Next consider the same amplifier and 100kHz sawtooth, but now the input amplitude is 100 mV rather than 1 V. [...] After 10x amplification the output is a 1 V, 100kHz sawtooth with a corresponding slew rate of 0.1 V per microsecond. [...] In this instance the 741 with its 0.5 V per microsecond slew rate will amplify the input properly.Modern high speed op-amps can have slew rates in excess of 5,000 V per microsecond. However, it is more common for op-amps to have slew rates in the range 5-100 V per microsecond. [...] For example, the general purpose TL081 op-amp has a slew rate of 13 V per microsecond. [...] As a general rule, low power and small bandwidth op-amps have low slew rates. [...] As an example, the LT1494 micropower op-amp consumes 1.5 microamp but has a 2.7kHz gain-bandwidth product and a 0.001 V per microsecond slew rate.|$|E
