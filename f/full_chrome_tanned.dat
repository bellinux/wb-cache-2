40|$|Originally, leather {{production}} {{is governed by}} an eco-friendly industrial process, because slaughter house waste such as the hides/skins discarded as waste material, is processed into useful materials such as leather goods, footwear and garments. During the leather making process, tanning {{is one of the}} most important operations, in which the tanning agents react with the collagen, stabilizing the triple helical structure of collagen matrix, thereby the leather acquiring resistance towards chemical, thermal and microbiological degradation. The currently employed commercial <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> for leather processing requires re-examination in the light of growing concern regarding the ecological inacceptability of chromium in tannery effluents. It seems more meaningful to render <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> more ecologically acceptable and complete by improving (a) exhaustioncharacteristics and (b) the filling mechanism of the tanning system.

40|$|Internationally about 400000 tons of <b>Chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> {{agents are}} used annually. The {{efficiency}} of {{the present state of}} the art tanning technology would suggest that about 60000 tons of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> agents remain unutilised during the <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> and might be discharged into the environment. Apart from environmental problems, this costs the industry ninety million dollars worth of valuable <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> agents annually. The research was aimed at minimising the environmental impact of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> by the improvement of the {{efficiency of the}} classical system through the addition of auxiliary chemicals during <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning,</b> changing the present technology and by modifying the <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> agent itself. Two different chemicals were synthesised. These were included in a detail study with six other commercial auxiliary chemicals to improve the classical system. Here the possibilities of improving the availability of carboxylic groups for better efficiency of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> were explored. A considerable improvement, about 90 - 93 % for hides and 95 - 96 % for lamb skins was obtained with these two synthesised chemicals. A novel chrome terming technique for tanning of lamb skins was developed where conventional acid-salt pickling was completely eliminated and tanning conducted after deliming at pH 7 to 8. 5. This novel technique also did not require basification and masking agents for the completion of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> and saved considerable amount of money for the tanner. This new approach of tanning gave higher exhaustion of chrome to the extent of 96 - 97 % with improved physical properties and yield of leather. The mechanism of the new tanning system was also postulated. Seventy percent of sodium sulphate, one of the pollutants of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning,</b> was removed from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate by crystallisation technique. Attempts were made to separate various species of chrome complexes with HPLC, Gel filtration (Saphadex G 25) and Ion exchange chromatography (SP Saphadex C 25) and finally six species of chrome complexes were separated from the commercial sulphur dioxide reduced 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor with ion exchange columns (Dowex 50 W x 8 and Dowex IX 8 - 50). It was interesting to find that about 20 % of the commercial basic chrome sulphate were anionic and nonionic complexes. In an attempt to understand their reactivity, separated species of complexes were studied for their ageing and tanning characteristics. This showed {{that as long as the}} pH of the liquor was kept constant, there was no significant change in these complexes due to ageing. Tanning affinity of each of these complexes was studied on pickled lamb skins at three different temperatures, namely 20, 30 and 40 °C. In general, anionic complex had no reactivity and the noniontc species was less reactive at normal tanning pH between 3. 0 and 4. 2. Similar tanning trials with cationic complexes showed that the affinity of these complexes with skin collagen increased progressively with the cationic charge of the complexes up to (Cr) 4 +, and then remained constant for complexes with higher charges than (Cr) 4 +. The reactivity of the combined cationic complexes was studied against standard commercial chrome control on similar pickled and degreased lamb skins. It was found that this combined cationic fraction tanned leather rapidly and more efficiently. The exhaustion of chrome, established through the analysis of chrome in the exhaust chrome liquor with the atomic absorption spectrophotometer, was 95. 11 % against 72. 25 % for the control. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines. A polyamide resin was synlhcsised. Initially 0. 75 g to 1. 25 g resin/mole of Cr 2 O 3 was used to modify the 33 % basic chrome sulphate liquor. The ageing characteristics of these complexes were also studied over a six month period. It was clear that the polyamide formed a stable complex with basic chrome sulphate and the ageing did not alter their characteristics significantly. Ion exchange separation (Dowex 50 W x 8) of the chrome-polyamide complex showed that this complex had an ionic distribution closer to phthalate masked basic <b>chrome</b> sulphate. <b>Tanning</b> trials with chrome-polyamide complex on pickled lamb skins and cow hides at low pH like the conventional <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> showed slightly better chrome exhaustion for lamb skin but no significant improvement for side leather. But when lamb skins were tanned according to the newly developed <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> process, a significant improvement in <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> was obtained. The exhaustion of chrome was more than 99 % and leather stood boil within two hours, shortening the <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> process considerably. The quality of leather obtained was shown to meet the requirements of leather prescribed in the European Commission's guide lines The novel process without pickling was tried successfully in the industry. The principle of this no-pickle novel <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> system was extended to the pretanned lamb skins where <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> was successfully carried out at high pH after degreasing without readjusting the pH of the tanning bath with acid to 3. 0 - 3. 5 and tanning completed without basification...|$|R

40|$|VII. Conclusion These {{preliminary}} {{results suggest that}} XRF can rapidly, effectively, and nondestructively identify <b>chrome</b> <b>tanned</b> leathers, since it can readily detect chromium ions, and lacks the dependence on binding strength that tends to make microchemical spot tests unreliable. Results are clear with modern specimens; lesser amounts of chromium detected in older leathers {{may be due to}} different thickness/density of the leathers, historical changes in tanning processes, or to retanning with other methods. The spectra also showed other elements that potentially provide useful information on how both modern and historic leather artifacts were processed. VIII. Further Research Further analysis of leather objects dating from the 1890 s onward would confirm the effectiveness of XRF in identifying <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning,</b> as well as shed light on various factors that may affect the levels of chromium detected in the leather, such as thickness/density, changes in the <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> manufacturing process, the use of combination tannages, or the possible presence of other chromium-containing compounds, for instance colorants, used in the finishing process. Investigating the efficacy of a vacuum chamber-based or helium flow XRF technique to detect aluminum would also be important, as <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> was primarily used at first to imitate kid leathers traditionally produced by alum tawing. Many of the 20 th century kid leather objects present in museum collections may have been produced via <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> alone or in combination with alum tawing or even a pale vegetable tanning, and knowing these differences would allow these objects to be put in a clearer historical and technological context.

40|$|The term “eco {{friendly}} ” leather {{meant the}} “chrome free ” leather. Around 80 % of leather is tanned using chromium. The chromium {{used in the}} tannery {{may be in the}} form of chromium III, IV and chromium VI compounds. The chromium tanned leathers use chromium III salts (Trivalent chromium) in the form of chromium sulfate. This form of chromium is found naturally in the environment and is necessary nutrient for the human body. However the chromium III oxidizes to chromium VI (Hexavalent chromium) in the presence of oxygen combined with other factors, such as extremes in pH. This happens during the tanning process. The hexavalent chromium produces allergic reaction and easily moves across the membranes such as skin, and it is a major cause for many diseases. This research work suggests using silicate tanning process by eliminating the <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> process to make eco friendly leather. The present tanneries which use <b>chrome</b> <b>tanning</b> process can be modified in to silicate tanning process to make pollution free tanneries and the future generations can be protected from very dangerous environmental impacts caused by chromium compounds...|$|R
40|$|The thermal {{decomposition}} of <b>chrome</b> <b>tanned</b> leather {{before and after}} a soaking treatment with NaOH was studied using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The effect of the solution concentration (0. 2 M and 0. 5 M) and the soaking time (5 min and 15 min) was evaluated. TGA experiments at four heating rates (5, 10, 15 and 20 °C min− 1) were run {{in a nitrogen atmosphere}} for every treatment condition. A kinetic model was developed considering the effect of the three variables studied, i. e. : the NaOH solution concentration, the soaking time and the heating rate. The proposed model for <b>chrome</b> <b>tanned</b> leather pyrolysis involves a set of four reactions, i. e. : three independent nth order reactions, yielding the corresponding products and one of them undergoing a successive cero order reaction. The model was successfully applied simultaneously to all the experimental data obtained. The evaluation of the kinetic parameters obtained (activation energy, pre-exponential factor and reaction order) allowed {{a better understanding of the}} effect of the alkali treatment on these wastes. Co-financial support for this investigation has been provided by IVACE, Generalitat Valenciana (Spain), and FEDER (EU) for research within the field of pyrolysis flash of leather waste...|$|R
