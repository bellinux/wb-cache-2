Promotion was secured on the final day of the season with a 2-0 victory over Sanremese, a day on which Alessandro Melli, a player who would go on to play an important role in some of Parma's most famous triumphs and enjoy considerable success at the club <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so, scored his first goal for the Gialloblu. Parma's first season back in Serie B was a successful one, missing out on promotion to Italy's top tier by just three points and eliminating A.C. Milan from the Coppa Italia, a result that convinced their owner, Silvio Berlusconi, to hire Sacchi as the new manager of the Rossoneri. His replacement, Zdeněk Zeman, was fired after just seven matches and replaced by Giampieri Vitali, who secured two mid-table finishes before being replaced in 1989 by Nevio Scala, who would introduce a 5–3–2 formation that would be the basis for much of the club's success during his reign.|$|E

[...] Sir Edmund Andros, who governed the Dominion for most of its existence, alienated many New Englanders, insisting on introducing the Church of England into Puritan Boston and vacating land titles issued under the old charter. [...] After the Glorious Revolution of 1688 deposed James, Massachusetts political operatives conspired to have Andros arrested and returned to England. [...] All of the affected colonies reverted to their previous rule, although Massachusetts did so without formal constitutional authority because its charter had been revoked.

The Pigot also sustained significant damage from the American battery. Some accounts describe the American prisoner (an elderly man named Richard Borden) as being aboard one of the boats coming under fire; these accounts describe the prisoner seeking shelter by laying flat {{on the floor of the}} vessel, despite attempts of his captors to have him stand (perhaps to try to dissuade the attackers); according to these accounts, one or two of the captors were eventually hit by shots from the Americans on shore. The prisoner was eventually released several days later. [...] In addition to the casualties at Bristol Ferry, the British suffered two killed and five wounded in the battle at Freetown, while the Americans suffered no casualties beyond the one captive, who apparently emerged without any noteworthy injury.|$|E

Estimating that 30,000 North Korean troops—perhaps half of those remaining in North Korea—had been caught between the US 187 RCT in the north and the US 1st Cavalry Division and ROK 1st Division to the south at Pyongyang, he predicted that they would soon be destroyed or captured by the UN advance. Yet, while the air drop itself had been a success, despite MacArthur’s optimistic predictions the operation came too late to intercept any significant North Korean elements and the American landings initially met little resistance. Indeed, most of the North Korean Army had succeeded in withdrawing north, and had crossed the Chongchon River, or were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so, while the government and most important officials had moved to Kanggye in the mountains [...] southeast of Manpojin on the Yalu River.

Though all of the main line of Ultima games are arranged into trilogies, Richard Garriot later revealed that Ultima VII was the first game where he did any sort of planning ahead for future games in the series. He elaborated that [...] "the first three didn't {{have much to do}} with each other, they were 'Richard Garriott learns to program'; IV through VI were a backwards-designed trilogy, in the sense that I tied them together as I wrote them; but VII-IX, the story of the Guardian, were a preplanned trilogy, and we had a definite idea of where we wanted to go." [...] An expansion pack was released named Forge of Virtue that added a newly arisen volcanic island to the map that the Avatar was invited to investigate. The tie-in storyline was limited to this island, where a piece of Exodus (his data storage unit) had resurfaced. To leave the island again, the Avatar had to destroy this remnant of Exodus. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so, he also created The Black Sword, an immensely powerful weapon possessed by a demon.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the return}} to 2D had been met with high praise, the {{characters}} were modeled in 3D and then pre-rendered and saved in 2D sprites rather than being hand-drawn 2D sprites, which was initially met with mixed reception from fans. Cecil explained that the game was in full HD in order achieve the highest visual quality possible, but the original animations from The Shadow of the Templars and The Smoking Mirror were created in 640×400; a move to HD would require animations three times larger, and hand-animating so many pixels might be possible, but would be a [...] "massively complicated job." [...] To further quote Cecil, [...] "The massive advantage of rendering and then modelling is that obviously the data is much more manageable, we can connect animations much more smoothly, {{we can continue to}} tweak to optimise the 2D look which we’re <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing,</b> and you can hand-touch them at the end. A lot of people have said that we should be doing 2D, and I totally respect their comments, but my opinion is that it’s just not feasible. I’m also very pleased with the way the sprites are looking anyway. What we probably need to do is communicate that the end result is they look like they’re sprites, they look like they’re 2D. So I don’t regret the decision at all, and I’m absolutely convinced it’s the right one. I just don’t think we’ve communicated as well as we should have done that the end results will look like cartoony 2D sprites." [...] He also stated that 2D and 3D in HD brings the [...] "best of every world." [...] Technology written specifically to give the sprites a more [...] "cartoony" [...] look was written.|$|E

I could not marry a woman who had fought a duel,-- certainly not a woman who had fought with her own husband. I am told also that you shot another gentleman in Oregon. It may well be that the gentleman deserved to be shot; but there is something in the deed so repulsive to me,--no doubt irrationally,--that, on that score also, I must decline to marry you. I am told also that Mr Hurtle has been seen alive quite lately. I had understood from you that he is dead. No doubt you may have been deceived. But as I should not have engaged myself to you had I known the truth, so now I consider myself justified in absolving myself from an engagement which was based on a misconception.' It would no doubt be difficult to get through all these details; but it might be accomplished gradually,--unless <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so he should incur the fate of the gentleman in Oregon. At any rate he would declare to her as well as he could the ground on which he claimed a right to consider himself free, and would bear the consequences.
