5|$|While early explorers {{reported}} various traditions {{associated with}} Guanche mummification, {{there are three}} methods identified in modern times through scientific analysis: <b>evisceration,</b> preservation, and stuffing. These methods {{have been used in}} various different combinations depending on the era in which the mummy was created.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Dr. Don Gregorio Chil y Naranjo {{discovered}} several incisions in some mummies that he speculated {{may have}} been used to remove the internal organs. Don Brothwell's work in 1969 confirmed that <b>evisceration</b> was a method used by the Guanche. Along with a team of other scientists, Brothwell conducted a pathological examination of a Guanche mummy. The examination revealed that the body had been eviscerated, then the abdominal and thoracic cavities had been packed with a mud-like substance that contained the bark of a pine tree. Some sort of packing was also applied subcutaneously, but the exact make-up of this particular embalming substance is unknown.|$|E

50|$|Either {{general or}} local anesthetics {{may be used}} during <b>eviscerations,</b> with {{antibiotics}} and anti-inflammatory agents injected intravenously.|$|R
50|$|The term necroscope, {{as defined}} in the series, {{describes}} someone who can communicate with the dead (coined Deadspeak later in the series). Unlike necromancers, who here extract the knowledge they seek by brutal <b>eviscerations</b> of corpses, a necroscope can communicate with them as equals: peacefully and without any physical interference.The abilities of a necroscope are defined {{as a type of}} ESP.|$|R
25|$|Due to {{the sheer}} savagery {{of the murders}} and the {{precision}} of the <b>eviscerations</b> upon the victims' bodies, police theorized that the killings had been conducted by either a group harvesting organs to sell for transplant, {{the work of a}} Satanic cult, or a mentally ill individual. Much of the police effort concentrated upon the theory that the killer must be either mentally ill, homosexual, or a paedophile, and the alibis of all individuals who had either spent time in psychiatric wards or had been convicted of homosexuality or paedophilia were checked and logged in a card filing system. Registered sex offenders were also investigated and, if their alibi was corroborated, eliminated from the inquiry.|$|R
25|$|The newest {{model is}} the {{multipurpose}} conical orbital implant, {{which was designed to}} address the issues of the postoperative anophthalmic orbit being at risk for the development of socket abnormalities including enophthalmos, retraction of the upper eyelid, deepening of the superior sulcus, backward tilt of the prothesis, and stretching of the lower eyelid.1 after <b>evisceration</b> or enucleation, These problems are generally thought to be secondary to orbital volume deficiencies which is also addressed by MCOIs.|$|E
25|$|There {{is a large}} {{defect in}} the {{anterior}} wall of the Lady's torso. The viscera (internal organs) {{were removed from the}} mummy's embalmers, {{with the exception of the}} Lady's heart which is still visible within the body. The heart was apparently never moved. The embalming incision has been located in the left inguinal region. This tissue gap is 56 millimetres in length and 135 millimetres in depth. The torso contains both linen fibers which were mildly smeared with resin, and with linen packs treated with resin. One of the resin-treated linen packs was placed within the pelvis. The pelvic floor has a large defect, possibly used during the mummification process to remove the viscera. This would be an example of perineal <b>evisceration.</b>|$|E
25|$|Researchers {{have noted}} some peculiarities in the mummification process {{used on the}} Lady. The <b>evisceration</b> {{of the body and}} the {{stuffing}} of the torso with embalming materials were standard parts of the mummification process used during the entire reign of the 18th dynasty. This was not the case with the intact skull base and lack of effort to remove the brain, seen {{in the case of the}} Lady. This process had been used on early rulers of the 18th dynasty, as seen in the mummies currently identified with Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III. By the time of the later rulers of the 18th dynasty, when the Lady lived and died, the process had changed. All mummies from this later era contain some treatment of the brain, in attempts to remove it from the body. The mummification process used on the Lady seems like a throwback to an earlier era. Another peculiarity is the evidence that the people behind the mummification process were trying to repair and cover injured areas of the body. They used subcutaneous fillings and packs to remodel the injured left side of the face, the contralateral side of the face, and the right hip region. This was not part of the regular efforts of an embalmer.|$|E
25|$|By January 1983, four victims {{thus far}} killed had been {{tentatively}} {{linked to the}} same killer. A Moscow police team, headed by Major Mikhail Fetisov, was sent to Rostov-on-Don to direct the investigation. Fetisov established a team of 10 investigators, based in Rostov, charged with solving all four cases. In March, Fetisov assigned a newly appointed specialist forensic analyst, Viktor Burakov, to head the investigation. The following month, Olga Stalmachenok's body was found. Burakov was summoned to the crime scene, where he examined the numerous knife wounds and <b>eviscerations</b> conducted upon the child, and the striations on her eye sockets. Burakov later stated that, as he noted the striations upon Stalmachenok's eye sockets, any doubts {{about the presence of}} a serial killer evaporated.|$|R
2500|$|Chikatilo also {{informed}} Kostoyev he {{had often}} tasted {{the blood of}} his victims, to which he stated he [...] "felt chills" [...] and [...] "shook all over." [...] He also confessed to tearing at victims' genitalia, lips, nipples and tongues with his teeth. In several instances, Chikatilo would cut or bite off the tongue of his victim as he performed his <b>eviscerations,</b> then—either at or shortly after the point of death—run around the body as he held the tongue aloft in one hand. Although he also {{admitted that he had}} chewed upon the excised uterus of his female victims and the testicles of his male victims, he stated he had later discarded these body parts. Nonetheless, Chikatilo did confess to having swallowed the nipples of some of his victims.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of prosthetic biomaterials revolutionized surgery for the repair of abdominal wall hernias in humans. A tensionfree mesh technique has drastically reduced recurrence rates for all hernias compared to tissue repairs {{and has made}} it possible to reconstruct large ventral defects that were previously irreparable. Abdominal wall defects (hernias, eventrations, <b>eviscerations)</b> in large animals (cattles, horses) present also o high incidence, leading to morbidity, low productions, infertilities, poor performances. We used in our study polypropylene mesh which facilitated the reconstruction of large tissue defects in 6 animals (3 cows and 3 horses) and was not associated with any serious complications. The results of this study allow us to say that the use of prosthetic biomaterials is superior to simple suture repair and represent a modern and safely procedure in large animals. The biocompatibility of these biomaterials for long periods warrants further investigations...|$|R

About the song's theme, Sean Dooley of About.com commented, [...] "Swift takes no prisoners in her quest {{to make a}} former flame feel her wrath for doing her wrong." [...] In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged {{the fact that her}} former boyfriend was more in love with himself than with her. The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: [...] "There's no time for tears / I'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends." [...] For the refrains, she speaks of igniting fire on photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, [...] "As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn".

40|$|Wound {{management}} following laparotomy for postoperative peritonitis and {{varying degrees}} of parietal necrosis remains a challenging and controversial problem. Because maintained peritoneal integrity and primary wound closure offer the best opportunity for survival, an original technique involving bilateral incisions to relax skin and rectus fascia is proposed. This technique permits medial myocutaneous advancement and primary tension-free skin closure of midline laparotomy incisions. Sixty-nine patients with severe postoperative peritonitis were treated according from 1980 through 1985. Nine of these patients died of advanced multiple organ failure soon after referral, and eight more died after prolonged treatment. Fourteen patients had one or more reoperations for complications. Only nine wound failures resulted, including five <b>eviscerations</b> and four wound infections followed by progressive dehiscence. The bilateral relaxing incisions healed secondarily without complication. Survivors developed midline wound hernia; ten of the 52 surviving patients have had these repaired. This method of primary closure is safe when performed in conjunction with rigorous surgical care of intraperitoneal infection and may enhance survival. We recommend the technique to surgeons who treat severe postoperative peritonitis and septic necrosis of midline laparotomy wounds...|$|R
500|$|In 1970, British surgeon Thomas E. A. Stowell {{published}} an article entitled [...] "Jack the Ripper– A Solution?" [...] in the November issue of The Criminologist. In the article, Stowell proposed that the Ripper was an aristocrat who had contracted syphilis {{during a visit to}} the West Indies, that it had driven him insane, and that in this state of mind he had perpetrated the five canonical Jack the Ripper murders. Although Stowell did not directly name his suspect in the article, he described in detail the suspect's family and his physical appearance and nicknames, all of which pointed to Queen Victoria's grandson, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale. Stowell wrote that following a double murder on 30September 1888, his suspect was restrained by his own family in an institution in the south of England, but later escaped to commit a final murder on 9November before ultimately dying of syphilis. To back up his theory, Stowell drew comparisons between the <b>evisceration</b> of the women and the disembowelment of deer shot by the aristocracy on their estates. Stowell said his information came from the private notes of Sir William Gull, a reputable physician who had treated members of the royal family. Stowell knew Gull's son-in-law, Theodore Dyke Acland, and was an executor of Acland's estate.|$|E

In his 2011 review of Bedtime Stories, Brett Callwood of the Detroit Metro Times called the song [...] "spectacular". NPR Multimedia senior producer Keith Jenkins gave a positive review of the song, stating that it [...] "washes over you and gets your blood boiling.

Rikky Rooksby, author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna, was less impressed with the track.

To determine the incidence rate as well as causative diagnoses and surgical indications of enucleation in Iceland during the years 1992 - 2004. A retrospective population-based incidence study involving {{the entire population of}} Iceland. Medical records of all patients who underwent enucleation in Iceland from January 1992 through December 2004 were reviewed. The annually updated Icelandic census was used as a denominator data. Fifty-six eyes were enucleated during 1992 - 2004. No <b>eviscerations</b> were done, and the three exenterations performed {{were not included in the}} study. The mean annual age-adjusted incidence rate of enucleation in Iceland was 1. 48 enucleations per 100 000 population in comparison with 2. 66 enucleations per 100 000 for the time period 1964 - 1991. With advancing age, a significant increasing linear trend existed (p < 0. 001). The median age at enucleation was 51 years (SD 22; mean 55 years; 16 - 91 years). The three most common surgical indications for enucleation were blind painful eye, suspected ocular malignancy and acute trauma. The most common causative diagnosis for enucleation was traumatic lesion (39 %). The annual incidence was 2. 00 enucleations per 100 000 for men and 0. 95 for women. There were significantly more men in the traumatic lesion group (p < 0. 001), but no gender predominance was found in the other groups of causative diagnoses (p = 0. 8). The overall mean annual incidence of enucleation in Iceland is continually decreasing, although the incidence of severe ocular trauma and ocular malignancy is fairly stable...|$|R
5000|$|Chikatilo gave a full, {{detailed}} description of each murder {{on the list of}} charges, all of which were consistent with known facts regarding each killing. When prompted, he could draw a rough sketch of various crime scenes, indicating the position of the victim's body and various landmarks {{in the vicinity of the}} crime scene. Additional details provided further proof of his guilt: one victim on the list of charges was a 19-year-old student named Anna Lemesheva, whom Chikatilo had killed on 19 July 1984 near Shakhty station. Chikatilo recalled that as he had fought to overpower her, she had stated that a man named [...] "Bars" [...] would retaliate for his attacking her. Lemesheva's fiancé had the nickname [...] "Bars" [...] tattooed on his hand.In describing his victims, Chikatilo falsely referred to them as [...] " [...] elements" [...] whom he would lure to secluded areas before killing. In many instances, particularly (though not exclusively) with his male victims, Chikatilo stated he would bind the victims' hands behind their back with a length of rope before he would proceed to kill them. He would typically inflict a multitude of knife wounds upon the victim; initially inflicting shallow knife wounds to the chest area before inflicting deeper stab and slash wounds—usually 30 to 50 in total—before proceeding to eviscerate the victim. He had, he stated, become adept at avoiding the spurts of blood from his victims' bodies as he inflicted the knife wounds and <b>eviscerations</b> upon them, and would regularly sit or squat beside his victims until their hearts had stopped beating, adding that the victims' [...] "cries, the blood and the agony gave me relaxation and a certain pleasure." [...] When questioned as to why most of his later victims' eyes had been stabbed and/or slashed, but not enucleated as his earlier victims had been, Chikatilo stated that he had initially believed in an old superstition that the image of a murderer is left imprinted upon the eyes of the victim. However, he stated, in [...] "later years", he had become convinced this was simply an old wives' tale and he had ceased to gouge out the eyes of his victims.|$|R
