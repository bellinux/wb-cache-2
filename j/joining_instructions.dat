40|$|The {{present study}} {{is an attempt to}} {{investigate}} the effect of scaffolding writing proficiency through joint construction tasks on the writing composition of Iranian EFL learners and to investigate any significant difference in the writing proficiency of the girls and boys after receiving the instruction. To this end, sixty intermediate learners of English, majoring in Literature and Translation, studying at Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz participated in the research and then were randomly divided into two groups, the experimental and the comparison. During the course of this study, i. e. 10 sessions, the participants were assigned to write compositions of about 150 words on eight writing topics. To find out whether there is any significant difference in the writing proficiency of the learners who receive <b>join</b> construction <b>instruction,</b> two tests were used to compare the writing performances of the groups: a pretest prior and a posttest.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a simulator that {{allows users to}} explore concurrent I/O in UNIX. UNIX I/O provides an interesting example of how a shared variable, {{in this case the}} file offset, can be affected by concurrent access. The examples given can run on the simulator or a real UNIX-like system such as Linux, Solaris for Mac OS X. The simulator can run programs written by the user and display pictorially the relationship among various data structures involved in I/O, including the process file descriptor table, the system open file table, the inodes, and the data stored on disk. The user can run the program slowly, or step forward or back through the program to examine the data structures in detail. The simulator supports the creation of both child processes and threads as well as open, close, read, write, wait, <b>join</b> and detach <b>instructions.</b> The simulator is freely available for download.

The sea trials began in March 1961 and were carried to term {{under the command of}} Captain Atilio Porretti, who ordered changes to the vessel's rigging and figurehead. During this baptism voyage the ship successfully rode out a violent South Atlantic Ocean tempest. In March 1962 she <b>joined</b> the Navy's <b>Instruction</b> Division, formally starting out as the country's school ship.One year later, on 28 May 1963, the finished frigate was delivered to the Argentine Navy and, with the ceremonial hoisting of the Argentine Ensign, formally commissioned to replace ARA La Argentina as the Navy's school ship. On June 19, and without her figurehead attached (still being carved in wood by Galician-Argentine sculptor Carlos García González), she sailed from Buenos Aires on her first training voyage in command of Captain Horacio Ferrari, along with officers Orlando Perez Cobo, Heinz Otto Grunewald, and Lieutenant Commander Mario A.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{phenomenology}} of understanding {{in the context}} of development practice in East Africa. It is framed by stories of my life and work, experiences rooted in European traditions and provoked and expanded in encounter with African traditions. My question began with methods for dealing with poverty and suffering. Even with all my goodwill and education and the might of large institutions behind me, I found myself part of a series of analytical interventions that seemed to make the problem worse. Yet I would like to contribute to a world where people live together well. This thesis is the story of how I laid siege to this conundrum, working on it from various angles until I saw development intervention for the incoherent prejudice that it was. How could something as co-operative as living well with others be achieved by something so domineering as methodical intervention? Western development consciousness has not noticed that other cultures cannot and will not bear such hubris. So I questioned the notion that a good method (or a good institution, analytical technique or moral code) is the first requirement for fair co-existence. Development, I realised, is conversations that we <b>join,</b> not <b>instructions</b> that we give. I asked instead how I and others come to agree, a question that many people in my profession have never asked. In a close examination of the way I have come to understandings in my own life, I draw on the work of German philosopher Hans-Georg Gadamer. His philosophical hermeneutics bring together multiple aspects of understanding: its consciousness, historicity, eventfulness, and linguistic and conversational nature. With the help of African thinkers, I gain more perspective - I take part in understandings that are held, provoked and renewed in conversation across time, geography and entire societies. Through the journey represented by this thesis I have come to understand that understanding speaks the world, its history, diversity and potential. I have come to know that from understanding comes method, not the other way around. It is an insight that has profound implications {{for those of us who}} work in the development field.
