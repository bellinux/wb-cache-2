40|$|Scientists, mathematicians and engineers, {{had been}} studied the {{evolution}} of the hurricanes, during long time. One of the most interesting aspects that the hurricane researchers consider are the reasons that determine the <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracks.</b> The people who work on the meteorology field had used multiple tools to predict <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracks</b> for six (6) to seventy-two (72) hours in advance. The proposed method in this study is limited to 24 hours as a lead time. One the major problem that the hurricane experts are facing is to identify the appropriate observations to initialize <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracks.</b> A second important problem is to obtain the enough observations to model a hurricane that is under development. In this paper, we want to show some strategies to predict the hurricane displacement based {{on the first day of}} information and predict the <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracks</b> during its evolution...|$|R
5|$|The {{accuracy}} of hurricane forecast models can vary significantly from storm to storm. For some storms the factors affecting the <b>hurricane</b> <b>track</b> are relatively straightforward, and the models {{are not only}} accurate but they produce similar forecasts, while for other storms the factors affecting the <b>hurricane</b> <b>track</b> are more complex and different models produce very different forecasts.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hurricane</b> <b>track</b> {{forecasts}} {{have been}} getting better in recent years. Looking at the example of Hurricane Rita, the forecast of the National Hurricane Center 36 hours before landfall shifted more than 130 kilometers from the previous forecast, causing an unneeded evacuation. There has been research that {{has shown that the}} choice of subgrid-scale parameterization schemes can influence <b>hurricane</b> intensity, <b>track,</b> speed, and precipitation rates. Microphysical assumptions may directly or indirectly modulated storm structure, which result in small changes in the <b>hurricane</b> <b>track</b> which can have societal consequences.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} use a <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracking</b> chart, one needs access to latitude/longitude pairs of the cyclone's center and maximum {{sustained}} wind information in order to know which symbol to depict. New tropical cyclone information is available at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere and at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from Regional Specialized Meteorological Centers and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centers.|$|E
50|$|A {{tropical}} cyclone tracking chart {{is used by}} those within hurricane-threatened areas to track {{tropical cyclone}}s worldwide. In the north Atlantic basin, they are known as <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracking</b> charts. New tropical cyclone information is available at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere and at least every twelve hours in the Southern Hemisphere. Charts include maps of the areas where tropical cyclones form and track within the various basins, include name lists for the year, basin-specific tropical cyclone definitions, rules of thumb for hurricane preparedness, emergency contact information, and numbers for figuring out where tropical cyclone shelters are open.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Hurricane</b> <b>tracking</b> charts {{allow people}} to track ongoing systems to form their own {{opinions}} regarding where the storms are going {{and whether or not}} they need to prepare for the system being tracked, including possible evacuation. This continues to be encouraged by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and National Hurricane Center. [...] Some agencies provide track storms in their immediate vicinity, while others cover entire ocean basins. One can choose to track one storm per map, use the map until the table is filled, or use one map per season. Some tracking charts have important contact information in case of an emergency or to locate nearby hurricane shelters. [...] Tracking charts allow tropical cyclones to be better understood by the end user.|$|E
50|$|Stoddart was {{possibly}} {{the first person}} from his local grammar school (now demolished) to enter the University of Cambridge, in 1956 (a schoolfriend secured a place at Oxford). He studied tropical geography at St.John's College with Alfred Steers from 1956, graduating with a first class degree in 1959. His introduction to coral reefs came on the Cambridge Expedition to British Honduras (Belize), 1959-60. He returned there for further research into corals and the plants of the cays, working for Louisiana State University before and after a major <b>hurricane,</b> <b>tracking</b> its effects on atolls and reefs. He gained a Cambridge PhD for this work in 1964 and was appointed lecturer in Geography at Cambridge, rising through the ranks. He was a fellow of Churchill College, Cambridge from 1966 to 1987. In the mid-1980s he was a Regents Fellow at the Smithsonian.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} use <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracking</b> charts, one needs access to latitude/longitude pairs and maximum {{sustained}} wind information {{in order to}} know which symbol to depict. New tropical cyclone information is available at least every six hours in the Northern Hemisphere from the National Hurricane Center. [...] In decades past, newspaper, television, and radio (including weather radio) were the sources for this information. In the late 1970s, specialized programs such as A.M. Weather allowed people to tune at a specific time {{in the morning to}} get tropical cyclone-related information for the northeast Pacific and north Atlantic basins. [...] The advent of NOAA Weather Radio in the 1950s, which expanded during the 1970s in the wake of Hurricane Camille, by the National Weather Service allowed those with receivers that had access to the [...] "weather bands" [...] to listen in for tropical cyclone advisories in coastal/near coastal areas.|$|E

50|$|The KQ-X program {{ended in}} September 2012 without {{airborne}} fuel transfer occurring {{between the two}} UAVs. The two Global Hawks used in demonstrations were owned by NASA and jointly operated with Northrop Grumman. NASA required the two planes for atmospheric science missions in June 2012 after flight control testing and had to de-modify and reconfigure them to perform <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracking</b> flights after that. Further tests could have been performed, but NASA halted {{the use of the}} Global Hawks that June after a Navy operated version crashed. The May 30 flight was the ninth and final test of the program, with the two aircraft flying close at 44,800 ft to measure aerodynamic and control interactions. Data from the flights were put into virtual simulations that concluded 60 percent of autonomous refueling attempts would result in contact between the refueling probe and receiver drogue. Further unmanned refueling tests were carried out under the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator program with software from the Northrop Grumman X-47B UAV.|$|E
5000|$|Initially, {{the charts}} were in paper form. Magnetic charts {{appeared}} in 1956. [...] By 1974, laminated paper was used, and by 1977 maps were placed under glass, so that grease pencil, washable marker, or dry erase marker {{could be used}} and that the map {{could be used for}} multiple seasons. [...] Starting in the 1980s with the increasing popularity of personal computers, programs were available to track the storms digitally, and databases of past storms could be maintained. However, computational space requirements did not allow access to the entire hurricane database for a related basin until the 1990s, with the advent of more powerful computers with megabytes of storage and file quantities became less limited in computer directory structures. Starting in the mid 1990s, with the popularity of the World Wide Web, web sites kept images of old hurricane tracks and interactive web sites allowed you to specify parameters for the storms you wished to display. [...] Ongoing storms have tracking charts with forecast track overlaid. [...] Since 2004, GIS software has been available for <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracking.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Within the United States {{since at}} least 1956, during the Atlantic {{hurricane}} season, those within threatened states were provided <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracking</b> charts in order to follow tropical storms and hurricanes during the season for situational awareness. This was more popular along sections of the southern Eastern Seaboard and Gulf coast of the United States than the coast of California due to their increased danger of a landfalling tropical cyclone. The maps would include place names, latitude and longitude lines, names of the storms on that year's list, along with hurricane preparedness information. [...] Newspapers, television stations, radio stations, banks, restaurants, grocery stores, insurance companies, gas stations, the American Red Cross, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, state departments of emergency management, the National Weather Service, and its subagency the National Hurricane Center were the main suppliers of these charts. Companies would distribute these for free as they were considered good advertising. [...] Some would have a table where you could enter data prior to plotting the storm's position, usually using an associated tropical cyclone symbol: open circle for tropical depression, open circle with curved lines {{on opposite sides of}} the circle for tropical storms, and a closed circle with curved lines {{on opposite sides of the}} circle for hurricanes. [...] The Vanuatu Meteorology and Geo-Hazards Department started preparing special tropical cyclone tracking charts for its archipelago in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Though not {{the main}} goal, two work of Rosenfeld et al.. (2007) noted that in their {{simulations}} that the suppression of warm rain through the addition of large amounts of aerosols will cause the tropical cyclone to divert eastward. Zhu and Zhang (2006) report that the <b>hurricane</b> <b>track</b> was not sensitive to cloud microphysical processes except for very weak storms, which were pushed to the east. In a series of sensitivity studies, Pattnaik and Krishnamurti conclude that microphysical processes have little effect on <b>hurricane</b> <b>track.</b>|$|R

50|$|The first paper {{published}} {{that specifically}} {{looked at the}} impacts of cloud microphysics on <b>hurricane</b> <b>track</b> wa Fovell and Su (2007). They use simulations of Hurricane Rita (2005) and an idealized hurricane simulation to see how different microphysical parameterization and convection schemes change the <b>hurricane</b> <b>track.</b> They compared {{the effects of the}} Kessler (K), Lin et al. (L), and the three class WRF single moment (WFR3) schemes, coupled with the effects of Kain-Fritsch (KF), Grell-Devenyi (GD), and Betts-Miller-Janjic (BMJ) convective parameterization schemes. The hurricane that most similarly simulated Rita's track was when the WSM3 microphysics scheme was paired with BMJ convection. The worst simulated track was when the K microphysics was paired with KF convection, which produced a weaker storm that tracked well west of the actual storm. The spread from simply changing the microphysics and cumulus convection parameterization schemes produced the same spread in <b>hurricane</b> <b>tracks</b> as the National Hurricane Center ensemble.|$|R
