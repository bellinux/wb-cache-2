40|$|The U. S. {{natural gas}} {{pipeline}} industry {{is facing the}} twin challenges of increased flexibility and capacity expansion. To meet these challenges, the industry requires improved choices in gas compression to address new construction and enhancement of the currently installed infrastructure. The current fleet of installed reciprocating compression is primarily slow-speed integral machines. Most new reciprocating compression is and will be large, high-speed separable units. The major challenges with the fleet of slow-speed integral machines are: limited flexibility and a large range in performance. In an attempt to increase flexibility, many operators are choosing to single-act cylinders, which are causing reduced reliability and integrity. While the best performing units in the fleet exhibit thermal efficiencies between 90 % and 92 %, the low performers are running down to 50 % with the mean at about 80 %. The major cause for this large disparity is due to <b>installation</b> <b>losses</b> in the pulsation control system. In the better performers, the losses are about evenly split between <b>installation</b> <b>losses</b> and valve losses. The major challenges for high-speed machines are: cylinder nozzle pulsations, mechanical vibrations due to cylinder stretch, short valve life, and low thermal performance. To shift nozzle pulsation to higher orders, nozzles are shortened, and to dampen the amplitudes, orifices are added. The shortened nozzles result in mechanical coupling with the cylinder, thereby, causing increased vibration due to the cylinder stretch mode. Valve life is even shorter than for slow speeds and {{can be on the}} order of a few months. The thermal efficiency is 10 % to 15 % lower than slow-speed equipment with the best performance in the 75 % to 80 % range. The goal of this advanced reciprocating compression program is to develop the technology for both high speed and low speed compression that will expand unit flexibility, increase thermal efficiency, and increase reliability and integrity. Retrofit technologies that address the challenges of slow-speed integral compression are: (1) optimum turndown using a combination of speed and clearance with single-acting operation as a last resort; (2) if single-acting is required, implement infinite length nozzles to address nozzle pulsation and tunable side branch absorbers for 1 x lateral pulsations; and (3) advanced valves, either the semi-active plate valve or the passive rotary valve, to extend valve life to three years with half the pressure drop. This next generation of slow-speed compression should attain 95 % efficiency, a three-year valve life, and expanded turndown. New equipment technologies that address the challenges of large-horsepower, high-speed compression are: (1) optimum turndown with unit speed; (2) tapered nozzles to effectively reduce nozzle pulsation with half the pressure drop and minimization of mechanical cylinder stretch induced vibrations; (3) tunable side branch absorber or higher-order filter bottle to address lateral piping pulsations over the entire extended speed range with minimal pressure drop; and (4) semi-active plate valves or passive rotary valves to extend valve life with half the pressure drop. This next generation of large-horsepower, high-speed compression should attain 90 % efficiency, a two-year valve life, 50 % turndown, and less than 0. 75 IPS vibration. This program has generated proof-of-concept technologies with the potential to meet these ambitious goals. Full development of these identified technologies is underway.

5000|$|Critics of this {{approach}} argue that PoE is inherently less efficient than AC power due to the lower voltage, and this is made worse by the thin conductors of Ethernet. A typical 48-port Ethernet switch has a 50 W to 80 W power supply allocated for the traditional Ethernet switch and transceiver IC. Over and above this it requires typically a 740 W (for 802.3af) to 1480 W (for 802.3at) power supply allocated solely for PoE ports, permitting a maximum draw on each. This can be quite inefficient to supply through long cables. However, where this central supply replaces several dedicated AC circuits, transformers and inverters, and prevents expensive human interventions (AC <b>installations)</b> the power <b>loss</b> of long thin DC cable can be justifiable.

The constraints considered in these studies are based on conventional power system constraints, cost constraints, ESS constraints and renewable energy constraints. The conventional power system depends on generator ramp limit, power transfer capacity, power balance, bus voltage limit, reverse power flow from substation transformer and spinning reserve.

Today, {{it is possible to}} talk between Omaha and New York, a distance of fifteen hundred miles. Scarcely more than a decade ago, the telephone was regarded as a luxury. Today it has become a business and, almost a household necessity. Millions of capital are invested in the telephone industry and employment is furnished to thousands. Nearly every country village and hamlet has its telephone exchange. Farm lines extend every where. The country is being bound into one great community. Man's horizon is broadening. The telephone is bringing man into closer touch with his fellows, is fostering feelings of interdependence, and helping to unite him into one common brotherhood. For each subscriber to have facility to call up directly any other subscriber, would require so many lines as to make the scheme impracticable, if not impossible.

In this thesis, the characteristics {{of this kind of}} engine and relevant considerations of integration on a flying wing aircraft were studied. The studies can be divided into four levels: GTF- 11 engine modelling and performance simulation; aircraft performance calculation; nacelle design and aerodynamic performance evaluation; preliminary engine installation. Firstly, a geared concept engine model was constructed using TURBOMATCH software. Based on parametric analysis and SFC target, the main cycle parameters were selected. Then, the maximum take-off thrust was verified and corrected from 195. 56 kN to 212 kN to meet the requirements of take-off field length and second segment climb. Besides, the engine performance at offdesign points was simulated for aircraft performance calculation. Secondly, an aircraft performance model was developed and the performance of FW- 11 was calculated on the basis of GTF- 11 simulation results. Then, the effect of GTF- 11 characteristics performance on aircraft performance was evaluated. A comparison between GTF- 11 and conventional turbofan, RB 211 - 524 B 4, indicated that the aircraft can achieve a 13. 1 % improvement in fuel efficiency by using the new concept engine. Thirdly, a nacelle was designed for GTF- 11 based on NACA 1 -series and empirical methods while the nacelle dimensions of conventional turbofan RB 211 - 525 B 4 were obtained by measure approach.

This paper presents how the multipole method can be used for quick and accurate determination of heat <b>losses</b> from different <b>installation</b> alternatives of one or more insulated pipes in the ground. The multipole method utilises the cylinder geometry and the fact that real and imaginary parts of analytic functions satisfy Laplace equation to solve steady state heat conduction problems around pipes. The problem is solved in complex coordinates by using line sources and multipoles at the pipes. An equation system for the strengths of the line sources and multipoles is obtained. The equation system may be implemented in Mathcad or similar. Within negligible computer time a result of very high accuracy is obtained. As an example heat losses from two pipes in the ground are calculated. Two laying alternatives are studied: side-by-side and one pipe placed on top of the other. As heat is lost through the ground surface the total heat loss will increase slightly for shallower laying of the pipes and for the supply pipe put on top of the return pipe. Influences of the input parameters are studied for the side-by-side laying case. 1...|$|R

However, blacklists cannot be exhaustive, and lack the ability to detect newly generated malicious URLs. To improve the generality of malicious URL detectors, machine learning techniques have been explored with increasing attention in recent years. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey and a structural understanding of Malicious URL Detection techniques using machine learning. We present the formal formulation of Malicious URL Detection as a machine learning task, and categorize and review the contributions of literature studies that addresses different dimensions of this problem (feature representation, algorithm design, etc.). Further, this article provides a timely and comprehensive survey for a range of different audiences, not only for machine learning researchers and engineers in academia, but also for professionals and practitioners in cybersecurity industry, to help them understand {{the state of the art}} and facilitate their own research and practical applications. We also discuss practical issues in system design, open research challenges, and point out some important directions for future research. Comment: 21 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a new meta-heuristic approach technique for optimal location and sizing of multi-unit Flexible Alternating Currents System (FACTS) device installation using single- and multi-objective problems. It also considers techno-economic {{impact in the}} system. In this research, the first objective is to develop heuristic technique SingleObjective Particle Swarm Optimization (SOPSO) for optimal location and sizing of single-unit FACTS device <b>installation</b> with <b>loss</b> minimization, voltage monitoring and {{taking into account the}} cost of installation in the system. The verification was conducted through comparative studies with Single-Objective Evolutionary Programming (SOEP) and Single-Objective Artificial Immune System (SOAIS) techniques. The effect of weight coefficient, c 1 and c 2 and the effect of population size of loss minimization are also investigated. The second objective is to determine the location and sizing of multi-unit and multi-type FACTS device installation using SOPSO and SOEP. Consequently, the third objective of this research is to develop a new meta-heuristic technique termed as Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization (EPSO) for optimal placement and sizing of multi-unit FACTS device with single-objective problem. Comparative studies with respect to traditional PSO and classical EP techniques indicated that EPSO has its merit in terms of loss minimization. In addition, the cluster formation of FACTS device installation is also derived from the obtained results. The cluster formation of FACTS device installation was derived by looking at how many times (frequency) the load buses are selected for FACTS device installation identified by EPSO, PSO and EP techniques. The fourth objective in this research is to develop a new optimization technique termed as sigma-Multi-Objective EPSO (σ-MOEPSO) technique for optimal location and sizing of FACTS devices installation for multi-objective problem to minimize the transmission loss and cost of installation in power system. Finally, the fifth objective is to assess the techno-economic impact of FACTS device installation in power system. This assessment is performed by using a hybrid Evolutionary Particle Swarm Optimization - Net Present Value (EPSO-NPV) for assessing the impact of FACTS devices installation in duration up to 20 years. Comparative study has been done with Evolutionary Programming - Net Present Value (EP-NPV) technique. It was found that the proposed technique has been able to produce better performance as compared to other techniques and could be beneficial to power system planner in order to perform FACTS devices installation scheme for the minimization of loss and cost in their systems...|$|R
40|$|A novel fast {{version of}} {{particle}} swarm optimization method applied {{to the problem of}} optimal capacitor placement in radial distribution systems M. Pourmahmood Aghababa 1, A. M. Shotorbani 2, R. Alizadeh 3, R. M. Shotorbani 4 Abstract — Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a popular and robust strategy for optimization problems. One main difficulty in applying PSO to real-world applications is that PSO usually needs a large number of fitness evaluations before a satisfying result can be obtained. This paper presents a modified version of PSO method that can converge to the optima with less function evaluation than standard PSO. The main idea is inserting two additional terms to the particles velocity expression. In any iteration, the value of the objective function is a criterion presenting the relative improvement of current movement with respect to the previous one. Therefore, the difference between the values of the objective function in subsequent iterations can be added to velocity of particles, interpreted as the particle acceleration. By this modification, the convergence becomes fast due to new adaptive step sizes. This new version of PSO is called Fast PSO (FPSO). To evaluate the efficiency of FPSO, a set of benchmark functions are employed, and an optimal capacitor selection and placement problem in radial distribution systems is evaluated in order to minimize cost of the equipment, <b>installation</b> and power <b>loss</b> under the additional constraints. The results show the efficiency and superiority of FPSO method rather than standard PSO and genetic algorithm.

40|$|The {{global demand}} for {{hydrocarbons}} {{is high and}} is also believed to be high in the future. Much of today s {{oil and gas exploration}} is carried out offshore and consequently, there is a risk if oil and gas blowouts at the seabed. Major concerns from a subsea oil and gas release are fire and toxic hazard to people working on offshore <b>installations</b> and <b>loss</b> of buoyancy of ships and floating installations. In addition, oil spills will result in both immediate and long-term environmental damage. Risk assessments are a very useful tool to pinpoint the risks of offshore oil and gas exploration and production. In terms of blowouts, these assessments require knowledge of the qualitative behavior and reliable quantitative estimates for where and when the oil and gas will surface. Since execution of underwater test releases of hydrocarbons is extremely costly, computer models are interesting research subjects. In this thesis, a simulation concept for forecasting oil and gas blowouts is presented. ANSYS FLUENT 15. 0. 0, a commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) package, is used to obtain both the qualitative behavior and the quantitative estimates. The model accounts for variation in bubble size and bubble density. In addition the model allows for the presence of ocean currents and gas dissolution. The released oil droplets and the natural gas bubbles are tracked while they rise towards the ocean surface in order to estimate the effect of ambient ocean currents. The general model set-up is first validated against experimental data, for which air-bubbles are released in a 7 m deep basin. The primary simulations are based upon a field experiment conducted in Norwegian waters during June 2000, known as DeepSpill. Four discharges of oil and gas from a water depth of 844 m was carried out under controlled circumstances. Extensive observations and documentation were acquired during the experiments, in addition chemical and biological samples were collected along the water column. In the present work, simulation results are presented, discussed and compared with chosen field data obtained from the DeepSpill experiment. The overall simulation results are found to correspond quite good with the results from the DeepSpill experiment. The mean path of oil corresponds favorably with the overall shape of the echo-sound images taken during the experiments. The point of complete gas dissolution is found to match the field data, as long as a mass transfer reduction factor is employed. However, the rise time of oil droplets are somewhat over-predicted, which may indicate a need for denser grid in the release zone and/or a reconsideration of the oil droplet size distribution...|$|R
40|$|The {{renewal of}} the {{existing}} housing stock is a slow progress and theexisting is quite old. The existing housing stock represents a largeamount of the bought energy need for heating and a simple method forquickly determining the energy performance is needed. There are many different methods for estimating the energyperformance of buildings. In this report the feasibility of using asingle-variate steady state method to investigate energy performancehas been tested. Bought energy need in single-family houses in a coldclimate has been observed during the cold period. The observationshave been made {{with the help of}} a measurement system requiring aminimal <b>installation.</b> The heat <b>loss</b> factor of the observed buildingshas been determined using the energy signature approach and differenttime scales have been tried. The result shows that to determine the heat loss factor of single-familybuildings, a single-variate method is valid. Daily averages are a goodtime scale for houses using radiators under the windows to heat thebuilding. Buildings with floor heating in concrete slab need to have alonger time scale, around 3 days. The method does not account for occupancy levels and separateenergy use in specific installations is not easy to estimate with theminimalized measurement setup. A combination of heat sources suchas district heating, electrical heating, heat recovery and/or fire stove isproblematic to handle with the energy signature method if enoughobservations for al heat sources can be achieved.

40|$|The Ministry of Power & Energy {{has taken}} {{initiative}} to electrify rural areas to uplift the living standard {{of the people}} in rural areas by providing the electricity, which is a basic need of people. Ceylon Electricity Board gives special concessions to in line with this by initiating number of rural electrification Projects Island wide. This increases the distribution losses by increasing the line lengths and by adding number of under loaded transformers to the power system. In this study, three main factors; selection of proper transformer capacity, effect of high tension line reconductoring, and effect of reactive power compensation are discussed in concerned to reduce the line losses in rural areas. The analysis was done as a case study for the Monaragala consumer service area. It was required to initially determine the load growth rate and the load factor for the area of concern. Load factor was obtained from the daily load curve of the passara feeder which feeds to the Monaragalaarea. The tabulated value was 0. 395. The load growth rate of the area was analyzed by collecting the historical data of 167 numbers of identified transformers located in three consumer centers in the Monaragala area from year 2010. The resulted load growth rate of 0. 48 was used in the analysis for data forecasting for next twenty years. The total cost of a transformer includes the initial purchase costs, maintenance cost and the cost due to losses of the transformer throughout the lifetime. The cost due to losses will be a cost for {{the country as a whole}} since this will affect to the total generation capacity to meet the country’s demand. Therefore the proper selection of transformers is vital for any electrical <b>installation.</b> Transformer <b>losses</b> were forecasted for next twenty years, for different transformer capacity ratings and total costs were analyzed. If the initial peak load of the transformer is less than 30 kVA, the most economical transformer is 63 kVA. In rural distribution systems, its large number of low load consumers is distributed over a large geographical area lengthening the network and this has created more problems to the energy management. The results of the case study done for the Monaragala area clearly shows that the HT reconductoing is not economically viable, with respect to the line loss reduction in the RE network is very low. This study is focused to analyze the effect of loss reduction by reactive power compensation too. The results of this case study for Monaragala area shows that it is more feasible to install a one 1200 kvar fixed type capacitor for Passara feeder of the Badulla Grid Substation (GSS). More generalizing the outcome of this research, it can be concluded that for rural areas, which are having the load growth rate around 40 % or below than that capacitor installation is economically viable and the ratings to be determined by a cost benefit analysis...|$|R
