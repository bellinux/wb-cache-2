60|$|During {{the very}} {{earliest}} period when we {{catch a glimpse}} of the English people on the Continent or in eastern Britain, a double system of naming seems to have prevailed, not wholly unlike our modern plan of Christian and surname. The clan name was appended to the personal one. A man was apparently described as Wulf the Holting, or as Creoda the Æscing. The clan names were in many cases common to the English and the Continental Teutons. Thus we find Helsings in the English Helsington and the Swedish Helsingland; Harlings in the English Harlingham and the Frisian Harlingen; and Bleccings in the English Bletchingley and the Scandinavian Bleckingen. Our Thyrings at Thorrington answer, perhaps, to the Thuringians; our Myrgings at Merrington to the Frankish Merwings or Merovingians; our Wærings at Warrington to the Norse Væringjar or Varangians. At any rate, the clan organization was one common to both great branches of the Teutonic stock, and it has left its mark deeply upon our modern nomenclature, both in England and in Germany. Mr. Kemble has enumerated nearly 200 clan names found in early English charters and documents, besides over 600 others inferred from local names in England at the present day. Taking one letter of the alphabet alone, his list includes the Glæstings, Geddings, Gumenings, Gustings, Getings, Grundlings, Gildlings, and Gillings, from documentary evidence; and the Gærsings, Gestings, Geofonings, Goldings, and Garings, with many others, from the <b>inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> of existing towns and villages.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A., Anthropology) [...] California State University, Sacramento, 2011. Ethnographic, biogeographic, and archaeological {{data suggest}} that root crops were an {{important}} part of the Late Archaic diet in northeastern California. Definitive evidence for the prehistoric existence of this pattern remains equivocal, however, requiring the need for new approaches to the problem. One of the more promising methods to accomplish this is starch-grain analysis, which has the potential to improve our understanding of root crop use and its significance with respect to broader issues of resource intensification and environmental change. This thesis examines curated collections from three different regions of northeastern California (Pit River Uplands, Madeline Plains, Secret Valley), as they relate to the prehistoric exploitation of root crops. This required the development to a standardized morpho-metric starch grain methodology and reference collection to analyze starch grains recovered from a sample of flaked and ground stone artifacts from sites in each of the three study regions. Many plant taxa starch grains are morphologically and metrically distinct, allowing for their identification. Four plant taxa (Perideridia sp., Lomatium sp., Triteleia sp., and Quercus sp.) and one more inclusive plant family (Apiaceae) were identified. This provides direct evidence of prehistoric root and nut use that has until now formerly been largely unconfined based on <b>inferential</b> archaeological <b>evidence.</b> This demonstrates that northeastern California Native American groups made use of many types of wild root crops that were prepared with a variety of tools, depending on the resource involved. It further demonstrates that starch grain analysis has tremendous potential to improve our understanding of prehistoric diets, as they relate to often-critical food staples that leave few physical traces in the archaeological record.

Three datasets have been utilised; the UK Trip Rate and Information Computer System (TRICS), the Scottish Household Survey and an original household travel survey which has been conducted in Manchester city centre.

Using Trics 2012 a, exploratory analysis has shown a significant variation in the urban form characteristics between residential neighbourhoods located in central locations and those located in other areas. Households in the central locations generally travel less than others; in particular, town centre households walk more and drive less than others in out-of centre areas.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Double-strand breaks {{are widely}} {{accepted}} {{to be the}} most toxic form of DNA damage. Molecules that produce double-strand breaks via a single chemical event are typically very cytotoxic and far less common than those that form single-strand breaks. It was recently reported that a commonly formed C 4 ′-radical produces double-strand breaks under aerobic conditions. Experiments described herein indicate that a peroxyl radical initiates strand damage on the complementary strand via C 4 ′-hydrogen atom abstraction. <b>Inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests that a C 3 ′-peroxyl radical induces complementary strand damage more efficiently than does a C 4 ′-peroxyl radical.

It is suggested that myths (traditional [oral] tales) are underutilized sources of information about coastal change in this region. This is illustrated by consideration of myths likely to recall (early) Holocene sea-level rise, particularly along the coasts of India and Australia, as well as myths recalling rapid episodic coastal emergence and submergence, the latter including the disappearance of entire landmasses (islands). Two examples of how details in such myths can inform geological understanding of coastal change are given. The first argues that myths recalling the rapid flooding of coastal cities/lowlands are likely to represent memories of extreme wave events superimposed on a rising (postglacial) sea level. The second suggests that many myths about landmass/island disappearance fail to report the occurrence of rapid (coseismic and aseismic) subsidence even though they provide <b>inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> that this occurred.

40|$|Aromatic ring flips of Phe and Tyr {{residues}} are {{a hallmark}} of protein dynamics {{with a long history}} in molecular biophysics. Ring flips lead to symmetric exchange of nuclei between sites with distinct magnetic environments, which can be probed by NMR spectroscopy. Current knowledge of ring-flip rates originates from rare cases in which the chemical shift difference between the two sites is sufficiently large and the ring-flip rate sufficiently slow, typically kflip < 10 (3) s(- 1), so that separate peaks are observed in the NMR spectrum for the two nuclei, enabling direct measurement of the flip rate. By contrast, a great majority of aromatic rings show single peaks for each of the pairs of δ or ε nuclei, which commonly are taken as <b>inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> that the flip rate is fast, kflip ≫ 10 (3) s(- 1), even though rate measurements have not been achieved.

Here we present a generic framework to quantify aspects of forecast quality using an inferential approach to calculate nominal significance levels (p-values) that can be obtained either by directly applying non-parametric statistical tests such as Kruskal-Wallis (KW) or Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) or by using Monte-Carlo methods (in the case of forecast skill scores). Once converted to p-values, these forecast quality measures provide a means to objectively evaluate and compare temporal and spatial patterns of forecast quality across datasets and forecast systems. Our analysis demonstrates the importance of providing p-values rather than adopting some arbitrarily chosen significance levels such as p < 0. 05 or p < 0. 01, which is still common practice. This is illustrated by applying non-parametric tests (such as KW and KS) and skill scoring methods (LEPS and RPSS) to the 5 -phase Southern Oscillation Index classification system using historical rainfall data from Australia, The Republic of South Africa and India. The selection of quality measures is solely based on their common use and does not constitute endorsement. We found that non-parametric statistical tests can be adequate proxies for skill measures such as LEPS or RPSS. The framework can be implemented anywhere, regardless of dataset, forecast system or quality measure. Eventually such <b>inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> should be complimented by descriptive statistical methods in order to fully assist in operational risk management...|$|E
40|$|Human {{communication}} {{is concerned with}} all the procedures by which one mind may affect another(35). This involves not only speech but also the other forms of non-verbal and action behavior which people use to influence one another(32). But {{in spite of the}} central role that communication plays in our lives, the origins of language and speech are somewhat obscure. The ear-liest remains of our material culture consist of crude articles of stone which date back 500, 000 to 1, 000, 000 years(34). Although we can surmise that at that early age people may have signaled to each other in some meaningful way, it is not until the appearance of Neanderthal man that signs of the presence of speech and communica-tion become more convincing. The middle paleolithic period, ranging from 150, 000 to 75, 000 B. C., produced outspoken flint points, a bone industry, and burial grounds. These findings together with evidence of the use of fire betray the existence of simple social institutions which presuppose man’s ability to communicate (12). However, the space {{on the floor of the}} jaw where the tongue muscles attach was small, and we must infer that Neanderthal people could not talk much or too well (17). Speech and language as we know them today are tied to the Homo sapiens group, which appeared during the fourth glaciation, within the last 50, 000 years. The engraved tools and cave paintings that prehistoric man left to pos-terity remove all doubt about his ability to cope with complex symbolic systems(5). The <b>inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> from which the evolution of communication has been re-constructed gives way to direct evidence with the appearance of the cuneiform writ-ing of the Sumerians. These people, who lived in the Mesopotamian Valley between 4, 000 and 300 B. C. (22), share with the Babylonians and Assyrians the honor of 1 Read at the 117 th annual meeting of Th...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to find a {{suitable}} approach to model econometrically exchange-rate dynamics. In the first chapter, I examine the empirical properties of four exchange rates. The data used are daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly exchange rates of the German mark, the British pound, the Swiss franc, and the Japanese yen against the U. S. dollar from July 1974 to December 1987. 1 study the moment properties and time-series properties of these exchange rates and find in daily and weekly data leptokurtosis and heteroskedasticity. On the other hand, the hypotheses of no serial correlation, of a constant mean of zero, and of a symmetric distribution cannot be rejected. The fact that the daily and weekly data are not strictly equi-distant does not have a strong impact on these empirical regularities. In chapter 2, static distributional models (mixture of distributions, compound Poisson process, Student distribution, and stable Paretian distributions) are estimated. Chi-squared goodness-of-fit tests reject these models. Direct <b>inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> against stable distributions is found by estimating the characteristic exponent by FFT and by estimating the exponent of regularly varying tails. In chapter 3, dynamic models of heteroskedasticity (ARCH and Markov-switching models) are introduced. Quite satisfactory results are obtained for the EGARCH model and the Markov-switching model whereas the ARCH, GARCH and GARCH-t models are in conflict with stationarity conditions for the variance. Chapter 4 compares the static and dynamic models with respect to goodness-of-fit and forecasting performance. With respect to goodness-of-fit criteria, the dynamic models appear to be superior to the static models. Furthermore, the dynamic models outperform a naive model of constant variance with respect to unbiasedness but not with respect to precision. Chapter 5 studies the option-price implications of the static and dynamic models. The spot-rate effects of static models are rather small and they disappear, as expected, under temporal aggregation. GARCH and EGARCH models, on the other hand, imply higher option prices compared to Black-Scholes option prices along the whole spectrum of moneyness. Only the Markov-switching model is compatible with observed smile effects...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} semantic and pragmatic {{characterization of the}} evidential morphology in Turkish. That evidentials are parasitic to tense/aspect morphology is well noted (Izvroski 1997, Matthewson et al. 2007 a. o.), and the traditional literature describes the morphemes that encode tense and aspect in Turkish, namely [-ml;] and [-DI] as also employing evidentiality (Lewis 1967, Underhill 1976 a. o.) The main hypothesis pursued in this dissertation is that evidential morphology is semantically decomposed as tense or aspect and epistemicity in Turkish. The evidential morphology differs in its compatibility with specific temporal adverbs, and {{there are differences between}} the assertability of each subtype of evidentials. Both of these facts argue for the existence of semantically two distinct indirect evidential forms in Turkish language. A comparison of English Present Perfect Aspect and the indirect evidentiality shows that Turkish is part of the well noted Present Perfect Puzzle. This would be unexpected if Turkish did not possess semantically distinct two indirect evidential morphemes. I claim that the English-like Present Perfect Aspect meaning is contingent on the availability of <b>inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> in Turkish. Cross-linguistically, the level of meaning evidential forms are interpreted in varies. I argue in this dissertation that evidentials are presuppositional operators in Turkish language. To that end, in addition to the regular truth conditionality tests, two arguments are used; (i) a comparison of the Free Choice Any in English and the herhangi bir in Turkish shows that the type of evidentiality involved in a statement is determinant in the pragmatics of this item, (ii) evidentials can be embedded, and this is unexpected if evidentials were operative at the speech act level. The pragmatic distribution of each evidential form suggests that evidentials convey information about speaker 2 ̆ 7 s commitment levels to the truth of a proposition, and each evidential subtype exhibits different pragmatic properties. ^ One other aspect of evidential morphology discussed in this dissertation is the semantic contribution of reduplication of the indirect evidential morphology in Turkish. Reduplication facilitates a new layer of meaning, which I claim is regulated by an abstract REDUP morpheme. ...|$|E
40|$|Northwestern Indiana has land {{surfaces}} and soils that are around 15, 000 years old, resulting from sediments deposited from the Wisconsinan Glaciation {{during the late}} Pleistocene period. These geologically young soils exhibit depletion of base cations and low pH 2 ̆ 7 s (near 4. 0) which are chemically similar to much older and more intensely weathered soils. We hypothesize that FeS 2 (iron pyrite) within the shale fragments of the glacial deposits was oxidized upon exposure of oxygen near the earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface and resulted in naturally occurring acid sulfate weathering. To test our hypothesis, we isolated the area with ArcGIS, collected clast samples from gravel pits, utilized historic soils databases, and analyzed samples with X-ray diffraction to determine if associated properties and soil minerals would support acid sulfate weathering {{as the cause of}} the current soil chemical properties. Soil samples and glacial outwash cobble-sized clasts were collected and X-ray diffraction was used to determine the presence of pyrite or of pyrite weathering products jarosite and gypsum. Existing soil databases and lab data were examined to obtain further details of the occurrence of the potential acid sulfate weathering. A review of the geologic literature was also conducted to put the acid sulfate weathering processes into a landscape perspective and geologic context. The clast samples and some soil samples indicated the presence of jarosite and gypsum which are commonly associated with acid sulfate weathering. This research also found that ultic soil properties and low pH soils were associated with sandy glacial outwash and this information was displayed spatially. The sandy outwash has a lower CEC and lower buffering capacity when compared to nearby higher clayey glacial till. There was <b>inferential</b> <b>evidence</b> of acid sulfate weathering in calcareous glacial which is illustrated by iron oxide pseudomorphs. The lack of initial pyritic shale combined with the neutralizing potential for the calcareous till prevented these soils from developing ultic properties and low pH 2 ̆ 7 s. Additionally, this research assessed the potential for naturally occurring arsenic in the soils. Elevated arsenic levels were found in soils that occurred in the lowest part of the landscape. Understanding the process of naturally occurring acid sulfate weathering and associated elevated arsenic within this landscape will provide more information on use and management of these areas. ...|$|E
